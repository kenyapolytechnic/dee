 STUDIES IN THE BOOK OF REVELATION

                         Introductory Note
    The books of the Bible reveal order and sequence. Genesis, the first book
of Inspiration, narrates the tragic fall of man from his sinless estate, and con-
tains the gospel in embryo. Revelation, the last book of the canon of Scripture,
foretells the restoration of all that was lost, and heralds the final victory of the
Redeemer and the redeemed.
    The opening sentence of God's Great Book states: "In the beginning God
created the heaven and the earth;" while its closing words in the Revelation
breathe the prayer, "Even so, come, Lord Jesus." Between these two quota-
tions what a wonderful unfolding of truth ! Here is the account of the age-
long controversy between Christ and Satan. Here is the pulsating story of
the plan of redemption, culminating in the marvelous revelation of the "Lamb"
of God which taketh away the sins of the world, the word "Lamb" appearing
twenty-eight times in this closing book of the Bible.


                        Lesson 1, for July 2, 1949

             Two Prophets and Their Writings
   MEMORY VERSE: "Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet
appear what we shall be: but we know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like
Him; for we shall see Him as He is. And every Man that hath this hope in Him
purifieth himself, even as He is pure." 1 John 3:2, 3.
   STUDY HELP: "The Acts of the Apostles," pages 539-577.
    AIM: To impress the lesson that, irrespective of heredity, environment, or educa-
tion, the lives of Daniel and John, for example, reveal what the Spirit of God can
accomplish through consecrated human instruments.

                            Early Life Compared
  1. What is known of Daniel's parentage and boyhood years?
Dan. 1:3, 6.

   NcrrE.—As a member of the royal household ("king's seed"), Daniel had
evidently received the best education that Jerusalem and the Jewish homeland
could provide. He was eighteen years of age at the time of his captivity in
Babylon. See Testimonies, vol 4, p. 570.
  2. What may we infer was the home of John the apostle, and
what was the occupation of his family? Matt. 4:18-21; John 1:43, 44.

    Nora.—"His birthplace was probably Bethsaida, a fishing village on the
 Sea of Galilee, the native place also of Peter, Andrew, and Philip. This seems
                                       [3]
 to be a natural inference from his intimate acquaintance with them, and from
 his being with them. His parents could not have been altogether poor: Zeb-
 edee had 'hired servants' (Mark 1:20) ; Salome was one of the women who
 provided for the Saviour's wants (Matt. 27:56), and who purchased spices
 to embalm Him (Luke 23:55). And our Saviour, when He was dying, com-
 mended Mary to the care of John, and requested him to take her to his own
 house. That Zebedee was in good circumstances and in a respectable social
 position may perhaps be inferred from the fact that John was known by the
 high priest (John 18:15)."—The Biblical Illustrator, John, vol. 1, Introduc-
 tion, p. 5.
  3. What special training did each of these young men receive?
Dan. 1:5, 17-20; Matt. 4:21, 22.

    NoTE.—"While receiving instruction from man in the duties of court life,
he.[Daniell was being taught by God to read the mysteries of the future."—
Prophets and Kings, page 485. For three years Daniel, while a student in the
schools of Babylon, was under instruction of the heavenly angels. For ap-
proximately a like period, John was a disciple sitting at the feet of the greatest
of teachers, and in this way "he obtained the highest education which mortal
man can receive."— Ellen G. White, The Sanctified Life, page 45.

                       Marvelous Transformation
   4. What name did Christ give to James and John? What were
the implications? Mark 3:17.

   NorE.—"Even John, who came into closest association with the meek and
lowly One, was not himself naturally meek and yielding. He and his brother
were called 'the sons of thunder.' While they were with Jesus, any slight
shown to Him aroused their indignation and combativeness. Evil temper,
revenge, the spirit of criticism, were all in the beloved disciple. He was proud,
and ambitious to be first in the kingdom of God."—The Desire of Ages,
page 295.
   5. When rudely repulsed by the Samaritans, what did James
and John propose to do? How was their vengeful spirit reproved?
Luke 9:51-56.

  6. What petition was presented to Christ by the mother of James
and John? Matt. 20:20, 21.

   7. In His reply, what did Jesus state is the measure of true
greatness? Matt. 20:25-28.

   NoTE.—"The one who stands nearest to Christ will be he who on earth
has drunk most deeply of the spirit of His self-sacrificing love, . . . love that
moves the disciple, as it moved our Lord, to give all, to live and labor and
sacrifice, even unto death, for the saving of humanity."—The Desire of Ages,
page 549.
                                        4
   8. As John yielded himself to the transforming influence of
divine love, what change occurred?- John 1:16; 1 John 3:2.

   NoTE.—"The beauty of holiness which had transformed him shone with
a Christlike radiance from his countenance. In adoration and love he beheld
the Saviour until likeness to Christ and fellowship with Him became his one
desire, and in his character was reflected the character of his Master."—The
Acts of the Apostles, page 545.

                      Similar Experiences
   9. For approximately how long a period did the public services
of Daniel and John, respectively, continue?
   ANSWER: Each ministered for about seventy years.
   10. What persecution did each suffer, and how was each de-
livered? Dan. 6:16,22.

    NOTE.—"John was cast into a caldron of boiling oil; but the Lord pre-
served the life of His faithful servant, even as He preserved the three Hebrews
in the fiery furnace."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 570.
   11. Under what circumstances was each given divine communi-
cations?
   ANSWER: At the time they received these heavenly visions, each was in
exile—Daniel in Babylon, and John on the barren isle of Patmos in the
Aegean Sea. See Rev. 1:9.
   12. In the inspired writings of Daniel and John what parallels
are observed?

   ANSWER: (d) Both beheld visions of Christ. Dan. 7:13; Rev. 1:12-17.
    (b) Both wrote of the books of record in heaven, of the sanctuary, and
of the judgment. Dan. 7:9, 10; 8:14; Rev. 11:19; 20:12-15.
    (c) Both depict Babylon: the one, the famous city and empire of the
ancient world; the other, the infamous Babylon of the Apocalypse.
    (d) Both present a prophetic historical outline.of the world events four
times, each line of presentation terminating with the eternal kingdom of
Christ.
    (e) Approximately fifty direct and indirect quotations from the book of
Daniel appear in the Revelation.

                   The Divine Credentials
   13. Concerning both of these men, what priceless testimonials
are given? Dan. 10:11; John 19:26.
   NoTE.—"The life of Daniel is an inspired illustration of what constitutes
a sanctified character." "John enjoyed the blessing of true sanctification."
—The Sanctified Life, pages 18, 48.
                                     [5]
    Concerning their writings the spirit of prophecy states: "In the Revelation
all the books of the Bible meet and end. Here is the complement of the book
of Daniel. One is a prophecy; the other a revelation."—The Acts of the
Apostles, page 585. "The book of Daniel is unsealed in the revelation to
John, and carries us forward to the last scenes of this earth's history. . . .
Study Revelation- in connection with Daniel. . . . Let Daniel speak, let -the
Revelation speak, and tell what is truth."—Testimonies to Ministers, pages
115-118.




                        Lesson 2, for July 9, 1949

               The Revelation of Jesus Christ
    LESSON SCRIPTURE: Revelation 1.
    MEMORY VERSE: "Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words
of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at
hand." Rev. 1:3.
    STUDY HELPS: Uriah Smith, "The Prophecies of Daniel and the Revelation,"
pages 339-359; "The Acts of the Apostles," pages 581-587.
    AIM: To show that in the Revelation"Christ has unfolded the responsibilities, the
dangers, and the triumphs of His church until He comes in glory the second time, and
also that He that "was dead" is "alive for evermore" and has the care of His church
in His own hands.

                Introduction to the Apocalypse
  1. With whom did this revelation originate? Who served as
messengers in the line of communication? For whom was it given?
Rev. 1:1, 2.

    NozE.—"The very name given to its inspired pages, 'the Revelation,' con-
tradicts the statement that this is a sealed book. A revelation is something
revealed. The Lord Himself revealed to His servant the mysteries contained
in this book, and He designs that they shall be open to the study of all."—
The Acts of the Apostles, page 584.
  2. What special blessing is pronounced upon the readers, the
hearers, and the keepers of this prophetic testimony? Rev. 1:3.

                       The Dedication
    3. To whom is the book of Revelation addressed? Rev. 1:4
(first clause), 11.

    NOTE.—"The names of the seven churches are symbolic of the church in
different periods of the Christian Era. The number seven indicates complete-
ness, and is symbolic of the fact that the messages extend to the end of time,
while the symbols used reveal the condition of the church at different periods
in the history of the world."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 585.
                                      [6]
   4. In His words of greeting what names and characteristics of
Himself does Christ mention? Rev. 1:5 (first sentence), 8. Com-
pare Ex. 3:14.

  5. How has the infinite love of the Redeemer been revealed to
His unworthy children? Rev. 1:5, 6.

   6. What glorious event climaxes redemption's plan in behalf of
fallen man? Rev. 1:7.
                      John's First Vision
   7. On what day of the week was John given this vision? Rev.
1:10; Mark 2:27, 28.
   Norz.—"It was on the Sabbath that the Lord of glory appeared to the
exiled apostle. The Sabbath was as sacredly observed by John on Patmos as
when he was preaching to the people in the towns and cities of Judea."—
The Acts of the Apostles, page 581.
  8. Turning at the sound of the voice, what did John behold?
Rev. 1:12.
  9. What do the seven candlesticks symbolize? Rev. 1:20, last
part.
   10. Where was Jesus seen standing? Rev. 1:13.
    Nom.—"Christ is spoken of as walking in the midst of the golden candle-
sticks. Thus is symbolized His relation to the churches. He is in constant
communication with His people. He knows their true state. He observes their
order, their piety, their devotion. Although He is high priest and mediator
in the sanctuary above, yet He is represented as walking up and down in the
midst of His churches on the earth. With untiring wakefulness and unremit-
ting vigilance, He watches to see whether the light of any of His sentinels is
burning dim or going out. If the candlesticks were left to mere human care,
the flickering flame would languish and die; but He is the true watchman in
the Lord's house, the true warden of the temple courts. His continued care
and sustaining grace are the source of life and light."—The Acts of the Apos-
tles, page 586.
   11. What did Christ hold in His right hand? What do these
represent? Rev. 1:16, 20.
                 The Glory of the Ascended Christ
   12. With what sublime language does John describe the ma-
jestic form and features of his glorified Lord? Rev. 1:13-16. Com-
pare Dan. 10:5, 6.
                                     171
   NOTE.—"Now John is once more permitted to behold his Lord. But how
changed is His appearance! He is no longer a man of sorrows, despised and
humiliated by men. He is clothed in a garment of heavenly brightness. . . .
His voice is like the music of many waters. His countenance shines as the sun.
In His hand are seven stars, and out of His mouth issues a sharp two-edged
sword, an emblem of the power of His word. Patmos is made resplendent
with the glory of the risen Lord."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 582.
  13. How did the radiant appearance of Christ affect the apostle?
What reassurance was given? Rev. 1:17. Compare Dan. 10:8, 9.

   14. Upon what irrefutable fact is the Christian's hope estab-
lished? Rev. 1:18.

   NOTE.—The resurrection of Christ is the cornerstone of Christianity. The
key to the future, yes, even the key to the grave, is in the hands of our un-
changing and Omnipotent Friend. Whether we wake or sleep, the certified
promise is given: "Because I live, ye shall live also." John 14:19.


                       Lesson 3, for July 16, 1949

       Christ's Message to Ephesus and Smyrna
    LESSON SCRIPTURE: Rev. 2:1-11.
    MEMORY VERSE: "He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto
the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is
in the midst of the Paradise of God." Rev. 2:7.
    STUDY HELP: "The Prophecies of Daniel and the Revelation," pages 361-372.
    AIM: To study Christ's preview of the history of His church during the gospel
era, that we may appreciate His tender love for His people and understand more fully
the divine compassion by which He warns, reproves, and chastens in order that He
may lead to repentance and full salvation.

                         The Churches Identified
    Through the centuries many distinguished Bible students have held that
under the symbolic representation of the seven churches of Asia the Holy
Spirit "delineated seven different states of the Christian church, which would
appear in succession, extending to the coming of our Lord and the consum-
mation of all things; that this is given in descriptions taken from the names,
states, and conditions of these churches."—Vitringa, as quoted by Matthew
Henry, in his treatise on Daniel and the Revelation, 1897 ed., p. 347.
       Ephesus, Era of Apostles (About 31 to 100 A.D.)
    1. Name the seven churches, and locate each of the designated
cities on a map in your Bible or Bible atlas. Rev. 1:11.

   2. From whom was the message to the church at Ephesus pre-
sented? Rev. 2:1.
                                         8
  3. What words of commendation were addressed to this church?
Rev. 2:2.
   NoTE.—Ephesus was the most populous city of Asia Minor. Paul, Apollos,
Priscilla, Aquila, Timothy, and others labored successfully in building up a
large Christian community there, and the development of the work in that
important center was typical of the manner in which the Spirit-filled church
of the New Testament carried the gospel to the entire world in that gen-
eration.
   4. In the face of formidable opposition what was the attitude
of the early church? Rev. 2:3.

   5. Into what spiritual condition had the church drifted? Rev. 2:4.

   Nom—Faith and zeal are neither inherited nor transferred from genera-
tion to generation. The crucial test of a religion often develops with the
children and grandchildren of its founders.
   6. What warning was issued to the church at Ephesus? Rev. 2:5.

  7. In spite of defects and failuies, fOr what was this church com-
mended? Rev. 2:6.
    NoTE.—From our meager sources of information, it appears that the Nico-
laitans [Nik'o-la'i-tans] were an offshoot from Christianity who disregarded
the law of God, sanctioned plurality of wives, and practiced certain heathen
rites.        •
    "The doctrine is now largely taught that the gospel of Christ has made
the law of God of no effect; that by 'believing' we are released from the
necessity of being doers of the word. But this is the doctrine of the Nicolai-
tans, which Christ so unsparingly condemned."—Ellen G. White, in Signs of
the Times, Feb. 25, 1897.
   8. To the victorious Christians of the Ephesus era what exalted
promise was given? Rev. 2:7.
    NOTE.—"The fruit of the tree of life in the Garden of Eden possessed super-
natural virtue. To eat of it was to live forever. Its fruit was the antidote of
death. Its leaves were for the sustaining of life and immortality."—Testimo-
nies, vol. 8, p. 288.
   Smyrna, Era of Martyrdom (About 100 to 313 A.D.)
  9. By what title does Christ address Himself to the church at
Smyrna? Rev. 2:8.
   NOTE.—The word Smyrna means "myrrh," which when crushed gives a
sweet-smelling savor and appropriately symbolizes the church of the second
period that passed through such fiery trials. Theirs was the experience of
crushed fragrance.
                                     9
   10. Through what painful ordeals did the church pass during
the second and third centuries? Rev. 2:9.

    NoTE.—In the prophetic picture the Smyrna church was poor in this
world's goods, but rich in faith toward God. Persecution purified its mem-
bers, and no word of reproof was spoken against the tried and suffering be-
lievers of this era. The term "Jews" as here used, evidently designates those
who were Abraham's seed in the highest and truest spiritual sense. See Rom.
2:28,29 ; Gal. 3:28, 29.
   11. In anticipation of approaching persecution and martyrdom,
what message of divine confidence was given to prepare them for
the crisis? Rev. 2:10, first part.

   NOTE.—At various times during those centuries the pagan Roman Empire
employed its mighty imperial powers to blot Christianity from the face of
the earth. The persecuted sought shelter in the mountain retreats and in that
vast labyrinth of subterranean passages known as "the catacombs." The "ten
days" here mentioned doubtless foreshadowed the ten literal years (303 to
313 A.D.) of relentless persecution under Emperor Diocletian, in which large
numbers of Christians perished.
   12. For the hour of trial what eternal reward was assured to
the heroes of the cross? Rev. 2:10, last part..

   13. To those who remained steadfast during the Smyrna epoch
of the church, what comforting assurance was offered? Rev. 2:11.

    NOTE.—"The second death is the only death that the people of God need
to fear. Satan may bring physical death to the faithful followers of Christ,
but they will be shielded from the second death. God's people will rejoice in
life everlasting; while the decree of the second death will be passed upon
Satan and his emissaries."—S. N. Haskell, The Story of the Seer of Ramos,
page 53.


                      Lesson    4, for July 23, 1949

    Christ's Message to Pergamos and Thyatira.
    LESSON SCRIPTURE: Rev. 2:12-29.
    MEMORY VERSE: "To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden
manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which
no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it." Rev. 2:17.
    STUDY HELPS: "The Prophecies of .Daniel and the Revelation," pages 372-
381; "The Great Controversy," pages 49-60 (new ed., pages 55-65).
    AIM: To view the church through the "telescope of prophecy" as it entered the
Dark Ages, and as it suffered at the hand of "that woman Jezebel" during the long
period of papal supremacy.
                                       [10 1
     Pergamos, Era of Popularity (About 313-538 A.D.)
   1. How does the writer of the letter to Pergamos designate Him-
self? Rev. 2:12.
   NOTE.—Pergamos is the name for the church which laid aside the humility
of Christ and the simplicity of the gospel, to enter the courts and palaces of
kings, and adopt the pomp and pride of priests and potentates.
   "It was when nominal Christianity became popular, and swayed the civil .
government, that the two-edged sword of the word was necessary to separate
between the true and the false."—Seer of Patmos, page 54. See also Heb. 4:12.
  2. Where was this church located, and how did it regard the
name and faith of Jesus? Rev. 2:13.

   NoTE.—"Those were days of peril for the church of Christ. The faithful
standard-bearers were few indeed. Though the truth was not left without
witnesses, yet at times it seems that error and superstitution would wholly
prevail, and true religion would be banished from the earth."—The Great
Controversy, page 55.
   3. What faithful martyr was here slain? Rev. 2:13, last clause.

  4. What charges were lodged against the church of Pergamos?
Rev. 2:14.
    NOTE.—The tragic story of Balaam recorded in Numbers 22 to 25; 31:
13-16 served as an allegory, indicating the manner by which the church of
Pergamos mingled with paganism and adopted so many of its rites and super-
stitions.
  5. What heresy was condoned by the members of this church?
Rev. 2:15.

    NOTE.—As explained in the previous lesson, the Nicolaitans were a group
of professed Christians who advocated a mystical interpretation of Scripture,
but who in reality repudiated the fundamental truths of the gospel. They
talked loudly of their liberty in Christ, then used that liberty to follow their
own selfish inclinations.
   6. What vigorous call to repentance was sounded? Rev. 2:16.

  7. To those who loyally withstood the lure of false philosophy
and the inroads of paganism, what priceless promises were given?
Rev. 2:17.

    NOTE.—"Those who had in sin partaken of food offered to idols, are
offered in exchange the 'hidden manna.' Manna is the bread of heaven, and
as it was the only food necessary to nourish the multitudes of Israel during
their forty yeas journey, it became a fit emblem of Christ, the bread sent
                                    [111
down to the world. Eating flesh sacrificed to idols brings death, but hidden
manna brings life."—Seer of Patmos, page 58.
   "Today heaven has- a new name carved on a pure white stone for each
sinner who repents, and the deeper the crimson dye of sin, the purer the stone
will appear by contrast."—Seer of Patmos, page 61.
       Thyatira, Era of the Church in the Wilderness
                   (About 538-1798 A.D.)
  8. In what dazzling likeness did Christ appear as He conveyed
His message to Thyatira? Rev. 2:18.

  9. Enumerate the graces for which the faithful of this church
were commended. Rev. 2:19.

   10. What tyranny sought to dominate religious thought and
practice during this extended period? Rev. 2:20.

    Nom.—"In every detail," says S. N. Haskell, "the history of Jezebel is
a parable of the church history during the time, times, and half a time [the
1260 literal years] . . . of the papal supremacy, the period covered by the
message to Thyatira."—Seer of Patmos, page 64. During those fateful cen-
turies religious wars and persecution took the lives of millions.
  11. As a result of their evil deeds what dire sentence was pro-
nounced against the false prophetess and her children? Rev. 2:21-23.

   NOTE.—Jezebel and her husband Ahab were given every opportunity to
repent, but they continued their shameful idolatrous course until the day of
retribution. 2 Kings 9:30-37. In like manner modern Jezebel might have
repented, but she refused. Her temporary downfall occurred in 1798 when
Pope Pius VI was taken into exile by the French; but her final judgment and
overthrow is yet future.
  12. To Christ's little flock in Thyatira, what words of encourage-
ment were spoken? Rev. 2:24, 25.

    NOTE.—As in the days of Jezebel (see 1 Kings 19:18) so also during the
Dark Ages there were little companies hidden in mountain fastnesses and iso-
lated places who did not bow the knee to Baal. These faithful ones obeyed
the word of God and trusted in His promises.
  13. What honor and authority will be conferred upon those who
remained faithful throughout the long night of papal supremacy?
Rev. 2:26, 27.

    NoTE.—They shall reign because Christ reigns, and because He is pleased
to share His honor and authority with them.
   14. What cheering omen of dawn was also promised? Rev. 2:28.
                                    [ 12 ]
    NOTE.—With the promise of "the Morning Star," and the words, "Hold
fast till I come," the believers in Thyatira were pointed forward to the return
of Jesus. Near the close of this period there occurred the great Protestant
Reformation, the great earthquake of Lisbon (November 1, 1755), the dark-
ening of the sun (May 19, 1780), the birth of the American Republic as the
cradle of liberty, the cessation of persecution in most European countries, and
the departure of William Carey for India, the forerunner and father of mod-
ern missions. Like the psalmist the remnant in Thyatira testified: "My soul
waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning." Ps. 130:6.


                       Lesson 5, for July 30, 1949

     Christ's Message to Sardis and Philadelphia
   LESSON SCRIPTURE: Rev. 3:1-13.
    MEMORY VERSE: "He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white
raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess
his name before My Father, and before His angels." Rev. 3:5.
    STUDY HELP: "The Prophecies of Daniel and the Revelation," pages 383-396.
    AIM: To study the state of Protestantism in the early decades of the nineteenth
century, and the rise of the advent message in the days of William Miller, that faith
may be strengthened to watch for the triumph of the movement as foretold.

     Sardis, Era of Reformation (About 1798-1840 A.D.)
  1. How is the Message Bearer to the church of Sardis described?
Rev. 3:1, first part. Compare Rev. 1:13, 16, 20.

    NoTE.—Sardis was the name of a precious stone, and was an appropriate
title for the Protestant churches that emerged from the long, dark reign of
oppression that characterized the Thyatira period.
   2. What startling condition did the writer of this letter dis-
close? Rev. 3:1, last part.

    NoTE.—Sardis was the magnificent capital of Lydia in the days of the rich
and famous king Croesus. In recent years archaeologists have excavated the
site of this ancient city and disclosed imposing ruins.
    At the beginning of the nineteenth century, Protestantism gloried in her
new=found freedom, in her phenomenal progress and enlightenment. She
boasted of a name as illustrious as that of opulent Sardis. But He who
walked among His churches and searched among the seven stars found that
the church was spiritually dead.
    3. What appeal was addressed to the church of Sardis? Rev. 3:2.

  . 4. What were the believers of this era urged to remember? Rev.
3:3, first part.
                                         [ 13 ]
   5. Against what grave danger was the church warned? Rev. 3:3,
last part.

   NoTE.—The Acropolis at Sardis rose to a height of 1,500 feet, and with
ordinary watchfulness it was impregnable; but as a result of carelessness and
overconfidence, it was twice captured by stealth—first by Cyrus and later by
Antiochus. The prophetic warning evidently alluded to these ominous events
of history, and the danger signal was sounded: "Be watchful, . . . I will
come on thee as a thief." Verses 2, 3.
   6. To the worthy few in Sardis what inspiring assurance was
given? Rev. 3:4.

  7. What exalted, satisfying, and enrapturing awards await the
overcomer? Rev. 3:5.

   Nora.—The "white raiment," or fine linen, is defined as "the righteousness
of saints," or as the robe of Christ's righteousness "woven in the loom of
heaven." See Rev. 19:8; Christ's Object Lessons, page 311.

          Philadelphia, Era of the Advent Awakening
                     (About 1840-1844)
   8. With what terms and titles does Christ introduce Himself to
the church of Philadelphia? Rev. 3:7.

   NoTE.—This language is a quotation from the Messianic prophecy of the
Old Testament which states: "The key of the house of David will I lay upon
His shoulder; so He shall open, and none shall shut; and He shall shut, and
none shall open." Isa. 22:22.
   9. What was presented to the church of Philadelphia? Rev. 3:8,
first part.

   NorE.—Old Philadelphia was a "key" city located in a mountain pass that
served as a "door," or gateway, guarding the great caravan route between im-
portant cities of Asia Minor and the East.
   In this message Christ is represented as holding the "key," or position of
authority. He holds the key to death and the grave. Rev. 1:18.
   10. What word of commendation was addressed to the mem-
bers of this church? Rev. 3:8, last part.

   11. What struggle between the church and the synagogue of
Satan was foreshadowed? Rev. 3:9.

   NOTE.—Like the church in Smyrna, the church of Philadelphia received no
message of censure or reproof. According to the forecast both were to be
opposed by "the synagogue of Satan," "which say they are Jews,"' Rev. 2:9;
                                 [ 14 ]
and both were given the assurance of final victory. Both received their bap-
tism of suffering—the former at the hand of the Roman Empire, the latter
by large numbers of professed Christians who bitterly assailed the tidings of
Christ's imminent and Personal return.
  12. To those who patiently endure reproach and persecution,
what assurance is given? Rev. 3:10.

    NOTE.—From the context it is apparent that this promise is given, not only
to those of the Philadelphia period, but also for the remnant church who will
experience the final time of trouble. To all of these who suffer in the crucible,
the cheering announcement is made: "Behold, I come quickly."
   13. What urgent and solemn counsel is given to every struggling
soldier of the cross? Rev. 3:11, last part.

  14. Enumerate the promises made to the honored victors of
Philadelphia. Rev. 3:12.

    NOTE.— (a) "A pillar in the temple." Because of its numerous temples,
shrines, columns, and pillars, Philadelphia was called "Little Athens." Writ-
ing in the eighteenth century, the historian Gibbon bore this remarkable testi-
mony: "Among the Greek colonies and churches of Asia Philadelphia is still
erect—a column in the scene of ruins."—The History of the Decline and Fall
of the Roman Empire, ch. 64, par. 15. Yes, like a sentinel amid the debris of
the ancient city, a solitary pillar of great antiquity has stood for many centu-
ries. But, for the overcomer, Christ promises something infinitely better than
a crumbling, moss-covered column, for the victor is to become a pillar in
God's eternal living temple.
    (b) "He shall go no more out." Philadelphia suffered much from "violent
and oft-recurring earthquakes" which frequently drove its citizens to the open
couniry. By contrast, the victorious Christian is assured of absolute safety
and security in the city of many mansions.
    (c) Upon each victor is written the name of God, to whom he belongs,
and the name of the New Jerusalem, to which he is going. Thus sealed and
labeled, nothing can prevent his arrival at the promised destination.


                     Lesson 6, for August 6, 1949

                 Christ's Message to Laodicea
   LESSON SCRIPTURE: Rev. 3:14-22.
   MEMORY VERSE: "To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with Me in My
throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with My Father in His throne."
Rev. 3:21.
   LESSON HELPS: "The Prophecies of Daniel and the Revelation," pages 391-
405; "Testimonies for the Church," vol. 1, pp. 185-195.
   AIM: To consider anew the wonders of redeeming love and the means by which
Christ bruises and wounds that He may bind up and heal.
                                        [16 7
               Laodicea, Era of the Judgment Hour
                    (About 1845 to the End)
  1. Under what three titles does Christ address Himself to the
Laodiceans? Rev. 3:14.

    NoTE.—"Amen" is a Hebrew word meaning "true," "truth," "verily," "so
be it," or "that which cannot be changed." It carries the same thought as the
phrase, "the faithful and true Witness." In the Bible there are 250 names and
titles applied to Christ, but this is the only instance in which "Amen" appears
as a personal name.

                          A Severe Indictment
   2. In what spiritual state does Christ find this church? What
desire does He express? Rev. 3:15.

   NOTE.—Laodicea, signifying "the judging of the people," or "a just peo-
ple," is the closing period of the church on earth, during which time the in-
vestigative judgment takes place in heaven.
   "The message to the church of the Laodiceans is a startling denunciation,
and is applicable to the people of God at the present time."—Testimonies,
vol. 3, p. 252.
   3. Because of their lukewarm condition, what did the true Wit-
ness purpose to do? Rev. 3:16.

  4. What boastful assertions are made by members of this church?
Rev. 3:17, first part.

   Note.—Old Laodicea was a rich, proud city located in a beautiful, fertile
valley, and at the junction of two caravan routes. It was the home of many
wealthy citizens.
   The lesson' for the Laodicean church is obvious. Let no one boast of
material or statistical prosperity, of the growth of institutions, of mission
expansion, of per capita tithes and offerings, or of superior knowledge of
Bible truth. For all these we may be profoundly thankful; but far be it
from anyone to feel that he is rich, increased with goods, and in need of
nothing.
   5. Of what serious conditions are the members ignorant? Rev.
3:17, last part.

     NoTE.—"The testimony, so cutting and severe, cannot be a mistake, for
it is the True Witness who speaks, and His testimony must be correct."—
Testimonies, vol. 3, p. 253.
    "Many, I saw, were flattering themselves that they were good Christians,
who have not a single ray of light from Jesus. They know not what it is to
be renewed by the grace of God. They have no living experience for them-
selves in the things of God. . . . Dear friends, do not deceive yourselves
                                      16
concerning your condition. You cannot deceive God. Says the True Witness:
`I know thy works.' "—Testimonies, vol. 1, p. 190.

                         Diseases and Remedy
    6. What vital counsel is given regarding true riches? Rev. 3:18,
first part.

   NoTE.—Ancient Laodicea was an important banking center, and its finan-
cial operations extended throughout the Roman Empire. But God has for
His people something infinitely more valuable than the gold of Laodicea,
even' the pure gold of character refined in the crucible of affliction. See
1 Peter 1:7; Malachi 3:3.
   7. What clothing does the True Witness advise His people to
secure? Rev. 3:18, second part.

   NoTE.—Laodicea was a noted manufacturing center, its chief products
being clothing and rugs made of soft, glossy, black, natural wool from a
species of black sheep. Most famous of all were the black woven seamless
garments, so popular in New Testament times. By. contrast, Christ bids the
Christian obtain, not the black garments from the looms of Laodicea, but
the spotless white robes of fine linen which constitute "the righteousness of
saints." Rev. 19:8.
   8. For their spiritual blindness what effective remedy is pre-
scribed? Rev. 3:18, last part.

    NOTE.—Laodicea was also the seat of the celebrated medical college at the
shrine of Men Karou, whose physicians prepared the world-famous "Phryg-
ian powder" in cylindrical tablets, for the cure of eye diseases. This gives
apt and potent meaning to the counsel of the Great Physician, who appeals
to the Laodiceans to buy the heavenly eyesalve for the cure of their spiritual
trachoma and blindness. This eyesalve, or "oil of joy," typifies the true en-
lightenment of the Holy Spirit. 1 John 2:20; John 16:13.

                          The Rebuke of Love
   9. Because of His infinite love for this lukewarm church, how
 does Christ treat His indifferent children? What appeal is used?
 Rev. 3:19.

    NoTE.—"I saw that the testimony of the True Witness has not been half
 heeded. The solemn testimony upon which the destiny of the church hangs
 has been lightly esteemed, if not entirely disregarded. This testimony must
 work deep repentance; all who truly receive it will obey it, and be purified."
 —Early Writings, page 270.
    10. When the "straight testimony" of the True Witness is pre-
 sented to the church, what decisive results will follow?
                                [ 17 ]
    ANSWER: "I asked the meaning of the shaking I had seen, and was shown
that it would be caused by the straight testimony called forth by the counsel
of the True Witness to the Laodiceans. This will have its effect upon the
heart of the receiver, and will lead him to exalt the standard and pour forth
the straight truth. Some will not bear this straight testimony. They will
rise up against it, and this is what will cause a shaking among God's people."
—Early Writings, page 270.
  11. In presenting this appeal, where is the Master seen standing?
Rev. 3:20, first part.

    Nora.—" 'The Lord of glory comes all the way from His celestial palace—
comes in poverty, in sweat, in blood—comes to the door of a professed friend,
who owes all to Him, and cannot get in !—comes to rescue a man whose house
is on fire, and he will not admit Him ! Oh, the height, the depth, of Jesus
Christ's forbearance!'"—The Prophecies of Daniel and the Revelation, page
401. '
   12. What delightful association and fellowship await those who
respond? Rev. 3:20, last part.

                         Victory and Reward
   13. What crowning promise is made to the overcomer? Rev.
3:21.

   NorE.—"Wonderful indeed is this 'promise, which, being the last and the
crowning, is also the highest and most glorious,of all. Step by step they have
advanced, till a height is reached than which no higher can be conceived. And
more wonderful still, if we consider to whom this promise is here addressed.
He whom Christ threatened just now to reject with loathing out of His
mouth, is offered a place with Him on His throne. But indeed so it is; the
highest place is within reach of the lowest; the faintest spark of grace may
be fanned into the mightiest flame of divine love."—J. G. Butler, The Bible-
Work, comment on Rev. 3:21.
  14. In Christ's messages to His churches what appeal is here
made for the seventh time? Rev. 3:22.

   NcrrE.—"The solemn messages that have been given in their order in the
Revelation are to occupy the first place in the minds of God's people. Nothing
else is to be allowed to engross our attention. . . . Here are the truths that
concern our present and future welfare."—Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 302.


       Thirteenth Sabbath Offering, September 24, 1949

                     Lesson 7, for August 13, 1949

                      A Vision of the Throne
    LESSON SCRIPTURES: Rev. 4:1-11; 5:6-14.
    MEMORY VERSE: "Every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and
under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying,
Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power, be unto Him that sitteth upon the throne,
and unto the Lamb for ever and ever." Rev. 5:13.
    STUDY HELP: "The Prophecies of Daniel and the Revelation," pages 407-413,
419-423.
    AIM: To obtain a clearer, f tiller knowledge of the love of God and of the intense
interest which heavenly beings have in the redemption of man.

     The Open Door, the Throne, and the Bow of Promise
  1. What vision followed the prophetic history of the Christian
church? Rev. 4:1.

    Nom.—From the description that follows it is evident that this was not
a door into heaven, but a door "in heaven." The prophet was privileged to
behold the heavenly sanctuary and the throne. See Jer. 17:12.
    In the expression, "things which must be hereafter," the prophetic nature
of the Revelation concerning future events is again emphasized.
   2. Describe the appearance of the throne and the Divine Being
seated upon it. Rev. 4:2, 3. Compare Ezek. 1:26-28.

    Nom—The expression "jasper and carnelian," as given in the Revised
Standard Version of the New Testament, suggests the brilliant robes of
royalty. John saw the throne "set," or placed.
    In connection with the work of investigative judgment which began in
1844, Daniel saw that "thrones were cast down," or placed. In harmony with
this, Ellen G. Harmon, in February, 1845, "saw the Father rise from the
throne, and in a flaming chariot go into the holy of holies within the veil,
and sit down."—Early Writings, page 55. See Dan. 7:9, 13, 14.
    NoTE:—"The rainbow round about the throne is an assurance that God
is true, that in Him is no variableness, neither shadow of turning. . . .
The honor of His throne is staked for the fulfillment of His word unto us."
—Christ's Object Lessons, page 148.

                        The Throne of the Universe
   3. Who occupied the honored seats, or "thrones," about the
central throne? How were they attired? Rev. 4:4.

   NorE.—In nearly all the modern versions of the New Testament the word
"seats" is rendered "thrones."
    4. What scene of activity is vividly described? Rev. 4:5.
                                         [ 19 ]
   NOTE.—In the earthly sanctuary were "the seven ever-burning lamps" of
the golden candlestick (Ex. 25:31-37), while in the heavenly sanctuary they
are designated as "the seven lamps of fire" before the throne.
  5. How does John further explain the beauty of the throne?
Rev. 4:6.

    NorE.—The exiled prophet had frequently looked out upon the placid
waters of the Mediterranean, and to him the space about the throne 'appeared
like a crystalline sea. The term "beasts" is a wholly improper translation.
In the American Revised Version and the Revised Standard Version, it is
correctly rendered "living creatures."
   6. Describe the appearance of each of these living beings. Rev.
4:7.

   NOTE.—Jewish writers suggest that reference is here made to the four
principal tribal ensigns or standards of the camp. of ancient Israel; Judah on
the east, bearing the symbol of a lion, Ephraim on the west, carrying the
emblem of an ox or calf ; Reuben on the south, with the figure of a man ; and
Dan on the north, with the flying eagle on its pennant. Num. 2:3, 10, 18, 25.
   7. In what expression of homage and adoration do the living
creatures unite? Rev. 4:8.

   NorE.—"The angel showed me those who ceased not day nor night to
cry, 'Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty.' Continued repetition,' said the angel,
`yet God is glorified by it.' Although we may tell the same story over and
over, it honors God, and shows that we are not unmindful of His goodness and
mercies to us."—Early Writings, page 116.
   8. What chorus of response arises from the group of twenty-four
elders? Rev. 4:9-11.

              A Chosen and Distinguished Company

  9. In what sacred and exalted ministry are these elders engaged?
Rev. 5:8, margin.

    NorE.—"When the high priest entered on the Day of Atonement into the
holy of holies, he made his offering for the people with much incense, a cloud
ascended from the censor as long as he remained in Divine Presence. Today
in heaven those who once lived on earth, representatives from every kindred,
nation, and people, having passed through every phase of earthly experience,
take the prayers offered by penitent sinners, and present them before the
Lamb."—Seer of Patmos, page 106.
                                        •
    10. As they officiate in the heavenly sanctuary, what symphony
of praise flows from their lips? Rev. 5:9, 10.
                                     [ 2o ]
    NOTE.—"What could be more appropriate than that our Lord should be
assisted in His priestly work for the human race by noble members of that
race whose holiness of life, and purity of character, had fitted them to be
raised up for that purpose?"—The Prophecies of Daniel and the Revelation,
page 420.
   11. Relate the circumstances by which this favored group were
resurrected and taken to heaven. Matt. 27:50, 52, 53; Eph. 4:8,
margin.

   NOTE.—"Christ arose from the dead as the first fruits of those that slept.
He was the antitype of the wave sheaf, and His resurrection took place on
the very day when the wave sheaf was to be presented before the Lord. . . .
As Christ arose, He brought from the grave a multitude of captives. The
earthquake at His death had rent open their graves, and when He arose, they
came forth with Him. They were those who had been colaborers with God,
and who at the cost of their lives had borne testimony to the truth. Now
they were to be witnesses for Him who had raised them from the dead."—
The Desire of Ages, pages, 785, 786. Compare Early Writings, pages 184, 190.
                   Celestial Worship and Adoration
   12. Aside from the living creatures and elders, what "innumer-
able company" was seen to assemble before the throne? Rev. 5:11;
Heb. 12:22.

   13. What universal anthem of praise did the prophet hear as-
cending to God and His beloved Son? Rev. 5:12-14.

    NoTE.—"Songs of triumph mingle with the music from angel harps, till
heaven seems to overflow with joy and praise. Love has conquered. The lost
is found. Heaven rings with voices in lofty strains proclaiming, 'Blessing,
and honor, and glory, and power, be unto Him that sitteth upon the throne,
and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.'"—The Desire of Ages, page 835.

                    Lesson 8, for August 20, 1949

                 The Seven Seals of Prophecy
    LESSON SCRIPTURES: Rev. 5:1-7; 6:1-8.
    MEMORY VERSE: "One of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the
Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and
to loose the seven seals thereof." Rev. 5:5.
    STUDY HELP: "The Prophecies of Daniel and the Revelation," pages 415-419,
425-432.
    AIM: To study Christ's preview of the religious character of His church through
the ages.

                              The Sealed Book
   1. As John beheld the Father seated on the throne, what was
held in His right hand? Rev. 5:1.
                                       [21 ]
    NOTE.—The book of future events, or prophecy, is seen reposing in the
hand of God. In New Testament times books were composed of long strips
of parchment rolled together as a scroll. The obvious meaning of the text is:
"Written within, and on the back (or outside) sealed with seven seals."

   2. What challenge was issued by a strong angel? Could anyone
be found to meet the emergency? Rev. 5:2, 3.

   3. How did this situation affect the sympathetic prophet? Rev.
5:4.

  4. What good tidings were announced by one of the elders?
Rev. 5:5.

    NoTE.—Christ came to this world as a representative of the "lion" tribe
of Judah, and in the family and lineage of David. See Gen. 49:9, 10; Matt.
1:1-16; Isa. 11:1,10; Rev. 22:16.
  5. What was seen in the midst of the throne? What did the
Lamb do? Rev. 5:6, 7.

    NoTE.—Christ is the "Lamb slain from the foundation of the world," and
is here represented as pouring out His lifeblood for guilty man. The "seven
horns and seven eyes" typify perfection of power and perfection of wisdom.
Christ, the Lamb of God, was found worthy to loose the seals and open the
book of futurity.

                    The First Seal, Era of Purity
                   (Approximately 31-100 A.D.)
   6. As the first seal was opened, what did the prophet see and
_hear? Rev. 6:1, 2, first part.

    NOTE.—The time of the first seal corresponds to the period of the first of
the seven churches—Ephesus. The whiteness of the horse represents the
purity of faith in the early church; while the bow carried by the rider is a
fitting emblem of the Pentecostal spirit that inspired the apostles as they
went forth on their heaven-born mission.

   7. What success attended their efforts? Rev. 6:2, last part.

    NoTE.—The commission was unlimited, "Go ye into all the world;" and
filled with the Holy Spirit they valiantly carried the story of the cross past
barrier after barrier to the very outposts of civilization. To the Christians
in Rome Paul wrote: "I thank my God, . . . that your faith is spoken of
throughout the whole world;" while in his letter to the Colossians he declared
that the gospel had been "preached to every creature which is under heaven."
Truly, the "conquering" apostolic church won its "crown" of victory.
                                    [22]
         The Second Seal, Era of Conflict, Followed by
              Compromise (About 100-313 A.D.)
  8. Describe the second horse and horseman of the Apocalypse.
Rev. 6:3, 4, first part.

    NorE.—The red color of the horse would indicate conflict and bloodshed,
also a departure from the snow-white purity of former days. Several of the
Roman emperors sought to exterminate Christianity, and martyr blood flowed
freely. During long years of relentless persecution the witnesses for Christ
kept their faith unsullied; but at length Christianity became popular; and
what Satan could not achieve by force and brutality, he accomplished by
flattery and compromise.
  9. By this compromise what was presented to the world-loving
church? Rev. 6:4, last part.

    NorE.—The so-called conversion of Constantine to Christianity placed
"a great sword" in the hands of popular and unscrupulous church leaders.
Civil powers were used to enforce religious edicts. As apostasy increased,
bitter feuds and factions developed. Contention for office, prestige, and
power took "peace from the earth;" and the church began to use its "great
sword" to extend its authority and enforce submission to its decrees.

                The Third Seal, Era of Worldliness
                     (About 3 13-53 8 A.D.)
   10. With the opening of the third seal, what appeared? What
did the rider hold in his hand? Rev. 6:5.

    NorE.—The color black is an absolute contrast to the crystal-white purity
of the New Testament church. "As the stream of Christianity flowed farther
from its fountain, it became more and more corrupt, and as the centuries ad-
vanced, superstitution advanced with them; and unauthorized mortifications
and penances, and rigorous fastings, and vows of celibacy, and monkish retire-
ment and austerities, and stylitism, and the jargon and repetition of prayers
not understood, and tales of purgatory, and pious frauds, and the worship
of saints, relics, and images, took the place of pure and simple Christianity."
—John Chappel Woodhouse, The Apocalypse, 1805 ed., p. 146.
   11. What message from heaven foretold the spiritual condition
of the church during that era? Rev. 6:6.

   NorE.—These words foreshadowed the commercial spirit that entered the
church. The love of money crowded out the love for Christ and truth; and
almost every service connected with religion was obtainable at a price.
   The "oil and the wine," denoting the Christian graces of faith, love, purity,
willing service, etc., were in grave danger. This warning fell on deaf ears, and
with the passing decades, pagan abominations gradually took the place of
true virtue and piety.
                                     [ 23 ]
The Fourth Seal, Era of Papal Supremacy (About 538 A.D.
    to the Time of the Sixteenth Century Reformation)
   12. What was the color of the fourth horse? What power was
conferred upon the horseman? Rev. 6:7, 8.

   Nom.—"Popery had become the world's despot. Kings and emperors
bowed to the decrees of the Roman pontiff. The destinies of men, both for
time and for eternity, seemed under his control. For hundreds of years the
doctrines of Rome had been extensively and implicitly received, its rites rev-
erently performed, its festivals generally observed. Its clergy were honored
and liberally sustained. Never since has the Roman Church attained to
greater dignity, magnificence, or power. But 'the noon of the papacy was
the midnight of the world.'"—The Great Controversy, page 60.
   13. How does the suffering of His children affect the heart of
Infinite Love? Isa. 63:9.

   NorE.—"The mysterious providence which permits the righteous to suffer
persecution at the hand of the wicked, has been a cause of great perplexity
to many. . . . God has given us sufficient evidence of His love, and we
are not to doubt His goodness because we cannot understand the workings
of His providence. . . . Jesus suffered for us more than any of His followers
can be made to suffer through the cruelty of wicked men. Those who are
called to endure torture and martyrdom, are but following in the steps of
God's dear Son."—The Great Controversy, page 47.


                    Lesson 9, for August 27, 1949

     The Seven Seals of Prophecy (Concluded)
   LESSON SCRIPTURES: Rev. 6:9-17; 8:1.
   MEMORY VERSE: "It shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have
waited for Him, and He will save us: this is the Lord; we have waited for Him, we
will be glad, and rejoice in His salvation." Isa. 25:9.
   STUDY HELP: "The Prophecies of Daniel and the Revelation," pages 432-
451, 473.
   AIM: To further study the religious character of Christ's church through the
ages, and to appreciate the means by which God comforts His afflicted children and
warns the church and the world of impending judgments.

     The Fifth Seal, Era of the Reformation (From About
     1517 A. D. to the Middle of the Eighteenth Century)
   1. As the fifth seal was opened, what unusual sight greeted the
prophet? Rev. 6:9.

   NOTE.—The prophet John was beholding scenes that would take, place
                               [ 24 ]
on the earth. Christ had been sacrificed on the altar of earth. Christian mar-
tyrs were also slain on the earth and their blood poured out upon it. Accord-
ingly, Adam Clarke is wholly correct in stating that the altar here mentioned
"is upon earth, not in heaven."
  2. What appeal ascended to God from the souls of the martyrs?
Rev. 6:10.

    NoTE.—In the Bible the term "soul" is frequently used to mean "life" or
"person." In verse 9 it appears simply as a reference to the martyrs who
had been slain. The context, as will also be observed, is figurative language.
Of such symbolism the Scriptures afford numerous examples. The blood of
Abel is said to have cried from the ground. Gen. 4:9, 10. The trees counseled
together regarding the anointing of a king. Judges 9:8-15. Also the hire of
the laborers kept back by fraud, cried unto the Lord of Sabaoth. James 5:4.
In like manner, the blood of innocent martyrs appeals to God for a just
retribution.
   3. How were the noble martyrs for Christ vindicated? Rev. 6:11.

   NOTE.—In the sixteenth century, among the most enlightened nations of
earth, the Protestant Reformation began its work: Sentiment gradually
changed, and the martyrs were at length vindicated. "Then their praises were
sung, their virtues admired, their fortitude applauded, their names honored,
and their memories cherished. White robes were thus given to every one of
them."—The Prophecies of Daniel and the Revelation, page 436.

       The Sixth Seat, the Time of the End (From About
             175. 5 to the Second Coming of Christ)
   4. What notable catastrophe marked the opening of the sixth
seal, and what signs followed? Rev. 6:12.

    NOTE. "Among the earth movements which in historic times have af-
fected the kingdom of Portugal, that of November 1, 1755, takes first rank;
as it does also, in some respects, among all recorded earthquakes. The first
shocks of this earthquake came without other warning than a deep sound of
rumbling thunder, which appeared to proceed from beneath the ground, and
it was immediately followed by a quaking which threw down almost the
entire city [of Lisbon]. In six minutes sixty thousand pergons perished."—
William Herbert Hobbs, Earthquakes, pages 142, 143.
   5. In our Lord's great prophecy how was the time of these signs
specifically designated? Mark 13:24.

     NorE.—Although there have been other dark days, none of them have
 fulfilled the time specifications; but a notable dark day did occur on sched-
 ule time. With the middle of the eighteenth century, the violent persecution
 of Protestants abated; by the year 1773 religious toleration was granted by
 the leading nations of Europe, while the "days" of papal supremacy extended
                                       [ 25 ]
 to the termination of the 1260-year period in 1798, at which time the pope
 of Rome was taken into captivity.
     The historical "Dark Day," of May 19, 1780, occurred "in those days"
 yet "after that tribulation," or between 1773 and 1798.
    6. On that memorable occasion how did the moon testify in
 fulfillment of prophecy?

    ANSWER: "In the evening . . . perhaps it never was darker since the chil-
 dren of Israel left the house of bondage. This gross darkness held till about
 one o'clock, although the moon had fulled but the day before."—Boston
 Gazette and Country Journal, May 29, 1780.
    This statement concerning the full moon precludes any possibility of an
 eclipse. In the latter part of that night when the moon became visible, it
 had the appearance of blood.
     7. In prophetic sequence what great sign was to follow? What
 illustration from nature was employed? Rev. 6:13. Compare Matt.
24:29.

      NOTE.—"The most sublime phenomenon of shooting stars, of which the
  world has furnished any record, was witnessed throughout the United States
  on the morning of the 13th of November, 1833. The entire extent of this
  astonishing exhibition has not been precisely ascertained, but it covered no
  inconsiderable portion of the earth's surface. . . . The first appearance was
  that of fireworks of the most imposing grandeur, covering the entire vault
' of heaven with myriads of fireballs, resembling skyrockets. Their coruscations
  were bright, gleaming, and indessant, and they fell thick as the flakes in the
  early snows of December." —Bruitt, The Geography of the Heavens, page 157. ,
      The meteors appeared to emanate from one spot in the heavens; and
  numerous newspaper and magazine reports written at the time likened the
  sublime spectacle to that of a tree casting its unripe fruit when shaken by
  a mighty wind.
    8. Following these remarkable signs hung in the heavens for
 all to read, what did the prophet behold? Rev. 6:14. Compare
 Rev. 16:17.

    NOTE.—We are now living in the time of the sixth seal, and between the
 events of verses 13 and 14 of this chapter. The final scenes of earth will
 crowd one upon another in rapid succession. May the Spirit of God impress
 us each with the unparalleled solemnity and import of this hour.

               The Seventh Seal, the Day of Awards
    9. Under the seventh seal what conditions will prevail in
 heaven? What task assigned to the angels will cause this? Rev.
8:1; Matt. 24:31; 25:31.

    10. With what vivid language does the prophet Isaiah describe
 earth's final scenes of commotion? Isa. 24:19, 20.
                                     [ 26 ]
   11. In the midst of that appalling desolation and chaos, what
will the mighty men of earth do and say? Rev. 6:15-17.

   12. In striking contrast to the vast multitudes who are unpre-
pared, what will be the attitude of those who love and cherish the
hope of Christ's return? Isa. 25:8, 9.


                    Lesson 10, for September 3, 1949

                   The Seal of the Living God
   LESSON SCRIPTURE: Rev. 7:1-17.
    MEMORY VERSE: "I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the
seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it
was given to hurt the earth and the sea, saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor
the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads." Rev. 7:2,3.
    STUDY HELPS: "The Prophecies of Daniel and the Revelation," pages 453-
471; "Testimonies for the Church," vol. 5, pp. 207-216.
   AIM: To understand more fully the character of God, and also to understand the
heart preparation essential to His approval of us as candidates for heaven.

                       Angel Messengers
   1. Following the dramatic events to take place under the sixth
seal, what did the prophet John behold? Rev. 7:1.

    NOTE.—From the context it is evident that the work outlined in this
chapter is accomplished under the sixth seal, and is to be completed before
the disastrous events foretold in Rev. 6:14-17. This presentation, occurring
between the sixth and seventh seals, is parenthetical, and is here inserted to
describe the great work to be wrought in the hearts and lives of God's remnant
people.                                         .
    Angels are frequently commissioned as responsible messengers to this
world; and the expression "the four corners of the earth" evidently denotes
the four quarters, or points, of the compass. In the symbolic language of
Scripture, "winds" indicate war, strife, and commotion among the nations.
See Jer. 25:31,32; Dan. 7:2.
   2. What other angel appeared, and what was his message? Rev.
7:2, 3.

   NoTE.—Webster's International Dictionary defines a seal as "a mark, sign,
figure, or image;" also, "any device bearing a design so made, as by engrav-
ing, that it can impart an impression in relief upon a soft tenacious substance,
as clay or wax." It is universally used to authenticate or validate official
documents.
   3. Cite instances illustrating the use of the seal in Bible times.
1 Kings 21:8; Esther 3:12; 8:8. See also Gen. 41:41, 42.
                                          [ 27 ]
                      The Law of God Validated
   4. What is the purpose of God concerning His people and the
law? Isa. 8:16; 2 Tim. 2:19.

    NorE.—The seal may be affixed to a law or other legal document signifying
its validity and the authority which makes it binding, or it may be affixed to
property, showing the ownership, and by implication its intrinsic worth that
leads the owner to daim it as his.
    5. To which precept of the law is the seal of the living God
affixed? Ex. 20:8-11; 31:13, 17; Ezek. 20:12, 20. ,

    NOTE.—In Scripture usage the terms "sign," "seal," "token," and "mark"
are synonymous. A seal used in connection with government must indicate
the name of the lawgiver, his position of authority, and the territory over
which he rules. Examining the law of God, all of these .three requisites are
found only in the fourth command of the Decalogue. It acclaims the true
GOd as Jehovah, Creator of the universe. Accordingly, on His part, the Sab-
bath is a sign of His divine authority; on our part, it is a token of our loyal
allegiance to Him.
                     The Seal Upon the Forehead
   6. Upon whom is the seal of God to be placed? Rev. 7:4.

   NOTE.—"The class who do not feel grieved over their own spiritual de-
clension, nor mourn over the sins of others, will be left without the seal of
God."
   "Not one of us will ever receive the seal of God while our characters have
one spot or stain upon them. It is left with us to remedy the defects in our
characters, to cleanse the soul temple of every defilement. Then the latter
rain will fall upon us as the early rain fell upon the disciples on the Day of
Pentecost."—Testimonies, vol. 5, pp. 211, 214.
   7. By what agency does the Christian receive the seal of the
living God? Eph. 4:30.

   8. To qualify as candidates for eternal life, when must the prep-
aration be made? Heb. 3:7-9, 13, 14.

   NOTE.—"Now is the time to prepare. The seal of God will never be placed
upon the forehead of an impure man or woman. It will never be placed upon
the forehead of the ambitious, world-loving man or woman. It will never be
placed upon the forehead of men or women of false tongues or deceitful hearts.
All who receive the seal must be without spot before God—candidates for
heaven."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 216.
                             Spiritual Israel
   9. Who are to constitute this group of the redeemed? Rev. 7:4-8.
                                [ 28 ]
    Nora.—In ancient times the name of an individual was frequently de-
scriptive of his character; and since character alone is the determining factor
in obtaining the seal of God, it is evident that this group is composed of men
and women who have lived the victorious life. Literal Israel failed to qualify,
and was rejected as a nation. Many Gentiles, represented by the wild olive
branches, are grafted into the, original tree, and by adoption they become a
part of the true Israel of God. Rom. 11:17-26; Gal. 3:29.
   10. Which two tribes are omitted from this enumeration?
    ANSWER: Ephraim and Dan. The former enjoyed many advantages; but
at length the sad verdict was pronounced: "Ephraim is joined to idols: let
him alone." Hosea 4:17.
    Dan, likened to a serpent, was critical and faultfinding, and the members
of this tribe later drifted into idolatry. Gen. 49:16, 17; Judges 18:30. In
this list of tribes the name of Joseph appears, also that of his son Manasseh;
hence the number twelve is retained.
  11. What vast assemblage of the redeemed did the prophet also
behold? Rev. 7:9.

   NoTE.—"This vast throng is undoubtedly the saved out of every nation,
kindred, tribe, and tongue raised from the dead at the second coming of Christ,
showing that the sealing is the last work accomplished for the people of
God prior to translation."—The Prophecies of Daniel and the Revelation,
page 468.
   12. In what anthem of praise did the ransomed and the angels
unite? Rev. 7:10-12.
                           A Favored Company
  13. What inquiries were made by one of the elders? What reply
was given? Rev. 7:13-15.

    NoTE.—The True Witness urged the Laodicean church to secure "white
raiment." This counsel is accepted by many; and at length in heaven the
special company of 144,000, redeemed from the last generation of the earth,
is favored with an exalted position near the throne of God.
    14. What unrivaled assurances are given to those who pass
 through the time of trouble and emerge in triumph? Rev. 7:16, 17.

     Nora.—What a transition from the sorrows, privations, and perils of earth
 to the captivating delights and eternal peace of heaven!
     "There the heavenly Shepherd leads His flock to fountains of living waters.
 The tree of life yields its fruit every month, and the leaves of the tree are for
 the service of the nations. There are ever-flowing streams, clear as crystal, and
 beside them waving trees cast their shadows upon the paths prepared for the
 ransomed of the Lord. There the wide-spreading plains swell into hills of
 beauty, and the mountains of God rear their lofty summits. On those peace-
 ful plains, beside those living streams, God's people, so long pilgrims and
 wanderers, shall find a home."—The Great Controversy, page 675.

                  Lesson 11, for September 10, 1949

           The Downfall of the Roman Empire
   LESSON SCRIPTURE: Rev. 8:2-12.
   MEMORY VERSE: "My anguish, my anguish! I am pained at my very heart:
my heart is disquieted in me; I cannot hold my peace; because thou hast heard, 0 my
soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war." Jer. 4:19, A. R. V.
   STUDY HELP: "The Prophecies of Daniel and the Revelation," pages 474-491.
   AIM: To see clearly from the study of today's lesson the dissolution of the fourth
universal government, the Roman Empire, which continued for more than twelve
hundred years (753 B. C. to 476 A. D.), and for nearly six and a half centuries ruled
supreme throughout the civilized world.

                  A Message of Cheer and Assurance
   1. Who were seen standing before the throne, and what was
given to each? Rev. 8:2.

    NOTE.—The prophecy of the seven churches emphasizes the spiritual con-
dition of God's people along the centuries. The seven seals gives a historical
preview of the church in its relation to the world, and foretell the signs of
Christ's second coming. With this chapter a new prophetic series is intro-
duced, and in the seven trumpets the Bible student discerns an outline of im-
portant political and military events that have occurred in, the Christian Era.
    2. Before describing the work of the seven angels, what scene
attracted the prophet's attention? Rev. 8:3.

    NorE.—In the earthly tabernacle the golden altar stood before the veil
of the most holy place; similarly, in the true tabernacle and sanctuary which
the Lord pitched and not man, John was privileged to behold "the golden altar
which was before the throne."
   3. As the angel ministered at the altar of the heavenly sanc-
tuary, what occurred? Rev. 8:4.

   NorE.—How wonderful the assurance that the prayers of "all saints" are
lodged upon heaven's altar! "Every sincere prayer is heard in heaven. It
may not be fluently expressed; but if the heart is in it, it will ascend to the
sanctuary where Jesus ministers, and He will present it to the Father without
one awkward, stammering word, beautiful and fragrant with the incense of
His own perfection."—The Desire of Ages, page 667.
   4. When at length the priestly ministry of Christ and His asso-
ciates in the heavenly sanctuary is finished, what is to take place
on earth? Rev. 8:5.

   NoTE.—As Christ ceases His ministration in the sanctuary above, human
                                       [30 ]
probation ceases, and the seven last plagues are poured out upon the shelterless
heads of the multitudes who have rejected the offers of infinite mercy.
   5. For what apparent reason are verses 3-5 here inserted?

    ANSWER: "They are a message of hope and comfort for the church. The
seven angels with their warlike trumpets had been introduced; terrible scenes
were to take place when they should sound; but before they begin to blow, the
people of God are directed to behold the work of mediation in their behalf
in heaven, and to look to their source of help and strength during this time."
—The Prophecies of Daniel and the Revelation, page 475.
                           The First Trumpet
  6. With the sounding of the first trumpet what events were to
come to pass? Rev. 8:7.

    NoTE.—This presentation is given in symbolic language, and the trumpet
is frequently used in Scripture as an emblem of alarm, or war. Rome, reject-
ing her privileges, was in turn rejected, and her downfall was amazing and
terrible.
    A staggering blow to the Roman Empire came with the invasion of the
West Goths under Alaric. His army laid waste the land of Italy as he marched
toward Rome. This bold leader was the first but not the last barbarian to
enter and pillage the city.
    Thomas Hodgkin said of this leader of the Visigoths that he was equaled
"by only three men in succeeding times as a changer of the course of history.
And these three men are Mohammed, Columbus, and Napoleon."—Italy and
 Her Invaders, vol. 1, p. 809.
                          The Second Trumpet
   7. As the second angel sounded, what strange phenomena were
to occur? Rev. 8:8, 9.

  8. What nation was represented by the burning mountain, and
what part did it play in the fulfillment of prophecy?

    ANSWER: Another onslaught against the Roman Empire came from the
Vandals, one of the Germanic peoples who crossed the Strait of Gibraltar into
Africa and established Carthage as the capital of their kingdom. Here they
built large fleets, became a formidable sea power, made extensive raids on the
rich coastal lands bordering the Mediterranean; and at length, in 455 A.D.,
surprised and sacked the Seven-Hilled City, loading their ships with the rich
spoils and treasures of centuries.
    Genseric, the leader of the Vandals, was greatly feared by the inhabitants
of the empire. Gibbon, when speaking of the important role of this Vandal
in the downfall of Rome, says that his was "a name which in the destruction
of the Roman Empire has deserved an equal rank with the names of Alaric
and Attila."—The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,
ch. 33, par. 5.
                                      [31 ]
                     The Third Trumpet
   9. When the sound of the third trumpet was heard, what de-
scended upon the rivers and fountains of waters? Rev. 8:10.
   10. What was the name of the star, and what were the baneful
results of its fall? Rev. 8:11.
   11. What nomadic people suddenly overran the northern fron-
tiers of the Roman Empire to fulfill this prophecy?
    ANSWER: "It is here premised that this trumpet has allusion to the deso-
lating wars and furious invasions of Attila, king of the Huns, against the
Roman power. Speaking of this warrior, particularly of his personal appear-
ance, Barnes says:
    " 'In the manner of his appearance, he strongly resembled a brilliant meteor
flashing in the sky. He came from the East gathering his Huns, and poured
them down,       . . with. the rapidity of a flashing meteor, suddenly on the
empire.' "—The Prophecies of Daniel and the Revelation, pages 483, 484.
                      The Fourth Trumpet
   12. As the fourth war trumpet sounded its note of doom, what
lights were to be obscured? Rev. 8:12.
   NOTE.—" 'In the political firmament of the ancient world, while under
the reign of imperial Rome, the emperorship, the consulate, and the senate
shone like the sun, the moon, and the stars.' "—Alexander Keith, quoted in
The Prophecies of Daniel and the Revelation, page 487.
   In 476 A.D. barbarian soldiers of Italy prevailed upon the last emperor of
Rome, Romulus Augustus, to resign, and elevated their chief, Odoacer, as
ruler of the kingdom. By this act "the sun was smitten."
   In 540 A.D. the Roman consulship was extinguished by order of Emperor
Justinian, who was reigning in Constantinople, and the edict was executed
by one of his leading generals. In this way the light of the "moon" was
snuffed out in darkness.
   In 552 A.D. came the "extinction of that illustrious assembly," the Roman
senate. Another revolution had occurred, as a result of which "the fate of
the senate was sealed," and the senatorial stars were darkened. Rome " 'saw
her glories star by star expire:' till not even a single star remained to glimmer
on the vacant and dark night."—E. B. Elliott, Horae Apocalyptical, 4th ed.,
1851, vol. 1, p. 360.
   13. In the downfall of ancient Rome, what important truths
are emphasized? Isa. 45:21; Dan. 8:23-25.

    NOTE.—(a) The immutability of Bible prophecy; for only He who "in-
habiteth eternity" could have narrated the story long centuries before it came
to pass.
    (b) The fall of Rome, divinely symbolized by four trumpet blasts, is in
many respects a type of the final destruction of the world, which occurs at
the sounding of the seventh trumpet.

                 Lesson 12, for September 17, 1949

         The Three "Woe" Trumpets
  Moslem Supremacy and the End of the World
    LESSON SCRIPTURES: Rev. 8:13 to 9:21; 11:14-19.
    MEMORY VERSE: "The seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices
in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord,
and of His Christ; and He shall reign for ever and ever." Rev. 11:15.
    STUDY HELP: "The Prophecies of Daniel and the Revelation," pages 493-517,
542-547.
    AIM: To envision anew the hand of God in history, the surety of the gospel
message, and the certainty of final triumph for the kingdom of Christ.

  1. Following the prophecy of the fourth trumpet, what startling
announcement was made by an angel messenger? Rev. 8:13.

   NoTE.—"So desolating in character were the events to come that there
was a pause in the unrolling of the scroll of prophecy, while an angel pro-
claimed the nature of the trumpets next to sound."—W. A. Spicer, Beacon
Lights of Prophecy, page 225.

                            The Fifth Trumpet
  2. As the fifth angel sounded, what did the prophet behold?
Rev. 9:1, 2.

   NOTE.—" 'There is scarcely so uniform an agreement among interpreters
concerning any other part of the Apocalypse as respecting the application of
the fifth and sixth trumpets, or the first and second woes, to the Saracens and
the Turks.' "—Alexander Keith, quoted in The Prophecies of Daniel and the
Revelation, page 493.
   "Like a meteorite from the blue," declares the historian Davis, "there came
into the world a new religion; a religion primarily of power and not of love;
a military fanaticism."—A Short History of the Near East, page 100.
   3. What power did the symbolic locusts possess, and what un-
usual command was given them? Rev. 9:3, 4.

   NoTE.—"Like swarms from the hive, or flights of locusts darkening the
land, tribe after tribe issued forth, and hastening northward, spread in great
masses to the east and to the west."7-William Muir, The Caliphate, page 44.
  4. What further identifying characteristics described these desert
warriors? Rev. 9:7-9.

   NOTE.—"Horses prepared unto battle." Saracen armies were largely com-
posed of cavalry.
   "Crowns like gold." Bright colored turbans were worn by the Arabs.
   "Hair of women." The ancient Arabs also wore long hair.
                                       [ 33 ]
   "Teeth of lions." Their conduct in battle was marked by great ferocity.
   "Breastplates of iron" were worn by the Arabs as defensive armor.

                      The Coming of the Turks
  5. Under whom were the Saracens at length to be ruled, and
what name did he bear? Rev. 9:11.

    NOTE.—"Near the close of the thirteenth century, Othman founded a
government which has since been known as the Ottoman government, or
empire, which grew until it extended over all the principal Mohammedan
tribes, consolidating them into one grand monarchy. Their king is called
`the angel of the bottomless pit.' "—The Prophecies of Daniel and the Reve-
lation, page 502. The names "Abaddon" and "Apollyon" are both defined as
destroyer; which correctly expresses the character of the Ottoman govern-
ment.
  6. According to the prophecy, for what period of time was this
people given power to sting, afflict, and torment? Rev. 9:5, 6, 10.

    NoTE.—On July 27, 1299, Othman first invaded Nicomedia, a province of
Eastern Rome; and the historian Gibbon expresses surprise at "the singular
accuracy of the date." On the scale of a "day for a year" (Ezek. 4:6), five
months of prophetic time equal one hundred fifty literal years, and would
extend to July 27, 1449. During that entire period the Ottoman Turks con-
tinued an almost constant offensive against the Eastern or Greek Empire, yet
were unable to conquer it. They "tormented," but could not "kill" or over-
throw the government.

                          The Sixth Trumpet
   7. With the trumpet blast of the sixth angel, what voice was also
heard? Rev. 9:12-14.

   NorE.—This prophecy was given more than thirteen centuries before the
events occurred, and how remarkable the fulfillment 1 Throughout Western
Asia the Turks then assumed full leadership, and from the four divisions of
their territory about the Euphrates the Moslem leaders marshaled their hordes
for an assault on Christendom. Previously they had been restrained; now
they "were loosed."
   8. In the language of prophecy what was foretold regarding the
size of the invading army? Rev. 9:16.

   NoTE.—"The myriads of Turkish horse overspread a frontier of six hun-
dred miles from Tauris to Azeroum, and the blood of 130,000 Christians was
a grateful sacrifice to the Arabian prophet."—The History of the Decline and
Fall of the Roman Empire, ch. 57, par. 7.
  9. How was the appearance of the horsemen further described?
Rev. 9:17.
                            [34]
   Nora.—As a symbol of colors, fire stands for red, jacinth for blue, and
brimstone for yellow; while in the wartime dress of the Ottomans, these colors
predominated.
   The use of explosives and firearms in warfare was then but recently intro-
duced; and as warriors discharged their muskets while on horseback, it might
easily appear that the fire, smoke, and brimstone issued from the horses'
mouths.
  10. What deadly effect would be produced by the new mode of
warfare? Rev. 9:18, 19.

    NoTE.—History records.the memorable fact that the capture of Constan-
tinople by the Turks was the first great military triumph in which firearms
and cannon played the deciding part. With the invaders the horses' "tails"
were a well-known standard, or symbol, of authority, while the "mouth" of
the cannon brought victory and "power."
    "The third part," the Eastern, or Greek, portion of the Roman Empire,
was dead. It had been "killed" by the fierce horsemen of the Euphrates, even
as the revelator had foretold.

                Remarkable Fulfillment of Prophecy
  11. For what length of time was the Moslem Empire to continue?
Rev. 9:15.

    NOTE.—As shown above under question 6, the 150-year period of Turkish
"torment," ended in 1449. That very year, the throne of the Eastern Empire
was vacant, yet the new emperor would not accept the crown without first
obtaining approval of the Turkish sultan. This act indicated that his real
independence was gone. Four years later, in 1453, Constantinople was besieged
and captured. The eastern capital of the Caesars then became the royal seat
of the Ottoman Empire that extended its authority over rich and extensive
areas of three continents.
    "In the year 1840, another remarkable fulfillment of prophecy excited
widespread interest. Two years before, Josiah Litch, one of the leading minis-
ters preaching the second advent, published an exposition of Revelation. 9,
predicting the fall of the Ottoman Empire. According to his calculations, this
power was to be overthrown 'in A.D. 1840, sometime in the month of
August.' . . .
    "At the very time specified, Turkey, through her ambassadors, accepted
 the protection of the allied powers of Europe, and thus placed herself under
 the control of Christian nations. The event exactly fulfilled the prediction."
 —The Great Controversy, pages 334, 335.
                          The Seventh Trumpet
    12. As the seventh angel begins to sound, what mighty work is
 to be completed in the earth? Rev. 10:7.

    NoTE.—"The mystery of God" is the good tidings of salvation (Col. 1:26,
27) ; and during the sounding of this trumpet, the glorious gospel task is to
 be finished.
                                     [ 35 ]
   13. During this same time what other significant events were
to occur? Rev. 11:18.

    NoTE.—In rapid succession, the prophecy of the seven trumpets carries the
Bible student onward, past the downfall of Western Rome, the subjugation
of the Eastern Empire by the Turks, to the collapse of a world, the final judg-
ment, and the granting of final awards.
   14. For what thrilling announcement from heaven is the church
of Christ on earth ardently waiting? Rev. 11:15.

   NoTE.—We should be alert and attentive to the warning messages of the
trumpets, and make full heart preparation for citizenship in that kingdom of
peace.


                 Lesson 13, for September 24, 1949

                        The Two Witnesses

    LESSON SCRIPTURE: Rev. 11:1-13, 19. (Revelation 10 has been omitted in-
tentionally and will be studied in next quarter's lessons.)
    MEMORY VERSE: "Search the Scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal
life; and they are they which testify of Me." John 5:39.
    STUDY HELPS: "The Great Controversy," pages 265-288 (new ed., pages 243-
269); "The Prophecies of Daniel and the Revelation," pages 531-542, 546, 547.
    AIM: To get a clearer understanding of Satan's warfare against the Bible, and
the divine providences by which God has preserved and exalted His word.

                         Measuring the Temple
   1. What was given to the seer of Patmos, and what instruction
followed? Rev. 11:1.
   NoTE.—In this lesson we consider a portion of a parenthetical prophecy
presented between the sounding of the sixth and seventh trumpets.
   "The temple of God" here mentioned is manifestly the literal temple in
heaven. Sae Rev. 11:19. The worshippers are to be found in Christ's true
church on earth; while the measuring reed with which to appraise the spiritual
dimensions of the worshipers is the law of Ten Commandments. This divine
code is God's unchanging standard of character defining right and wrong, and
determining "the whole duty of man."
  2. What further instruction was given? For how long a period
would "the Gentiles" exercise unbridled restraint? Rev. 11:2.

   NoTE.—The "court" of the ancient temple was the place in which victims
were sacrificed. This world is the outer court in which Christ was crucified;
while according to this prophecy the Gentile apostasy would exalt itself to
rule the world and the people of God for forty-two months. Compare Dan.
7:21,25.
                                     [ 36 ]
                        Witnessing in Sackcloth
    3. During this period of oppression, what task was assigned to
, God's "two witnesses"? Rev. 11:3.

     NOTE.—Prophecy foretold this era of papal supremacy by employing three
 forms of expression:
     As 1260 days in this verse.
     As 42 months in verse 2 and Revelation 13:5.
     As 3% times, or years; in Daniel 7:25, and other references.
     With thirty days to the month and twelve months to the year, these
 periods are seen to be identical and, according to the day-year (Ezek. 4:6)
 interpretation of prophecy, to equal 1260 literal years.
     "The two witnesses represent the Scriptures of the Old and the New Tes-
 tament."—The Great Controversy, page 267.
   4. How are the two witnesses further identified? Rev. 11:4.
 Compare Zech. 4: 1 1 -14.

     NoTE.—Of the Old Testament Scriptures Christ said: "They are they which
 testify of Me." John 5:39. The two witnesses are also beautifully symbolized
 by two olive trees pouring forth "the golden oil" of divine grace as a contin-
 uous supply for the two light-giving candlesticks. "Thy word is a lamp unto
 my feet, and a light unto my path." Ps. 119:105.
    5. What warning is issued against any who injure, oppose, or
 pervert the word of God? Rev. 11:5; 22:18, 19.

    NOTE.—"Men cannot with impunity trample upon the word of God. . . .
 All who exalt their own opinions above divine revelation, all who would
 change the plain meaning of Scripture to suit their own convenience, or for
 the sake of conforming to the world, are taking upon themselves a fearful
 responsibility. The written word, the law of God, will measure the character
 of every man, and condemn all whom this unerring test shall declare want-
 ing."—The Great Controversy, page 268.
    6. In what way do the two witnesses possess power to shut out,
 or withhold, the blessings of heaven? Rev. 11:6.

    NoTE.—"It was the word of the Lord, by His prophet, that in old time
 shut the heavens from rain, turned water into blood, smote the earth with
 plague, and brought down the consuming fire."—Beacon Lights of Prophecy,
 page 248.

                       Warfare Against the Bible
    7. At the time when the two witnesses were to finish their testi-
  mony in sackcloth, what new assault would be made upon them?
  Rev. 11:7.
                                37
   NOTE.—Since the well-established date of 538 A. D. marks the beginning of
the sackcloth era, the 1260 years would extend to 1798. However, the actual
"days" (years) of persecution, were somewhat shortened (Matt. 24:22) ; and
during the closing years of that period the atheistic leaders of revolutionary
France waged unprecedented warfare against the Scriptures. In 1793 the •
French Assembly decreed that Bibles should be destroyed, that God did not
exist, that religion was a hoax, that the weekly Sabbath should be abolished,
that all churches should be closed, and that death was an eternal sleep.
   The index finger of fulfilled prophecy points unmistakably to infidel
France as "the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit;" or, as ex-
pressed by another, "the bottomless pit of atheism."
  8. Where were the "dead bodies" of the two witnesses to lie?
Rev. 11:8.

    NoTE.--"The licentiousness of Sodom in the days of Lot, was repeated
in France, especially in her capital. The gross idolatry of Egypt, with its
proverbial darkness, was to be found again in modern France. As the Jews,
by rejecting the word of God sent by the prophets, severed their connection
with heaven and crucified their Lord, so France repeated the sin, and cruci-
fied again the Son of God."—Seer of Patmos, page 201.
   9. As the peoples of other nations viewed the outrages perpe-
trated in godless France, what attitude would they assume? Rev.
11:9.

   NoTTE.—They would not suffer the slain witnesses to be buried. On the
contrary, the frightful scenes enacted in France aroused Christians in many
lands to new zeal in defense of the word.
  10. Among what class of people would there be rejoicing?
Rev. 11:10.

   NoTE.—Infidels, and all others who were "tormented" by the pure and
noble precepts of the Bible, celebrated their "liberty" with wild acclaim and
rejoicing; but "the triumphing of the wicked is short."

            Warfare Terminated; Scriptures Exalted
   11. After "three days and an half" (prophetic days, or literal
years) what miracle would occur? Rey. 11:11.

   NOTE.-" 'The church and the Bible had been slain in France from Novem-
ber, 1793, till June, 1797. The three years and a half were expended, and the
Bible, so long and so sternly repressed before, was placed in honor, and was
openly the book of free Protestantism l' "—George Croly, quoted in The
Prophecies of Daniel and the Revelation, page 540.
   12. With what other figurative language did the prophet de-
scribe the French Revolution? Rev. 11:13.
                                   [ 38]
   NOTE.-In narrating the events of that amazing political upheaval, nu-
merous historians use the phrase, "the earthquake of the French Revolution."
   The expression "the tenth part," doubtless refers to France as one of the
ten divisions into which the old Roman Empire was divided.
    Instead of the words, "slain of men," the marginal rendering is "names
of men;" and in the French Revolution all titles of nobility, such as prince,
duke, knight, etc., were forever abolished.
   "The remnant were affrighted." So terrifying _were the scenes of bloodshed
and horror throughout the cities and towns of France that even the infidels
themselves trembled, and the leaders advised a return to religion.
   13. What voice was heard from heaven, and what was the re-
sult? Rev. 11:12.

    NOTE.-The two witnesses of Scripture that were so shamefully and arro-
gantly dishonored during the French Revolution have since been highly ex-
alted. In whole, or in part, the Bible now speaks to the peoples of earth in
1,100 languages and dialects. More than a billion copies of the word have been
published, and each year an output of approximately thirty million new copies
flow forth from the printing presses of the world. Truly, the Bible is exalted
"to heaven in a cloud."
   14. What did the prophet declare would be seen during the
closing period of earth? Rev. 11:19.

    NOTE.-As certain devout Bible students searched the Scriptures, their
attention was directed to the temple, or sanctuary above, which is the center
of the Work of redemption. By faith they continue to view the ark of God
and the Ten Commandments, which constitute the foundation of the throne
eternal. In the name of Christ they pledge their allegiance to God and His
unchanging law. With the open Book they go forth to proclaim the everlasting
gospel to all peoples. Then probation closes, and nature itself testifies to the
concluding scenes of earth's drama.

                 THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
                     September 24, 1949—Inter-American Division
        This far-flung mission field has many urgent needs, but only three of
   them are stressed in this appeal. If one need is more urgent than others, it
   is the enlargement of soul-winning work among the millions of Indians in
   Inter-America, and particularly among the tribes in southern Mexico and
   Guatemala. Our work in behalf of these people has met with good success,
   and we may confidently expect an even greater harvest. Another urgent
   need is to provide some modest meetinghouses in the French West Indies.
   The state church has great cathedrals in the cities, and ample churches in
   rural sections; but our people meet in private homes, under trees, or wher-
   ever they can, because prejudice hinders renting such halls as there are. Fi-
   nally there is the appeal for funds to assist in the establishment of a mission
   hospital in Puerto Rico. The "right arm" of the message has been actively
   at work in this island field for many years, and we have the opportunity to
   make this further advance.
       The last "overflow" offering to Inter-America, in 1947, provided
   $30,719.37 for schools and clinics. Surely this threefold appeal will inspire
   greater liberality in the offering Sabbath, September 24. Let us make it an
   average "double dollar" day in every Sabbath school.
