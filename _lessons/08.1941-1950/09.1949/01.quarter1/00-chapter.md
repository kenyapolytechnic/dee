                      The Law and the Gospel
    MEMORY VERSE: "For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through
the flesh, God sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned
sin in the flesh: that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not
after the flesh, but after the Spirit." Rom. 8:3, 4.
    STUDY HELP: "Patriarchs and Prophets," chapters 2 to 4.

                             An Ordered Universe
   1. How did the physical universe originate? 'What is the secret
of its harmonious operation? Heb. 11:3, first part; Isa. 40:26.

   NoTE.—"Everything in nature, from the mote in the sunbeam to the
worlds on high, is under law. And upon obedience to these laws the order and
harmony of the natural world depend."—Thoughts From the Mount of
Blessing, page 77.
   2. To whom does man owe his life? Upon what is his well-
being dependent? Acts 17:28; Deut. 30:19, second part.

    NoTE.—"There are great principles of righteousness to control the life of all
intelligent beings, and upon conformity to these principles the well-being of the
universe depends."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, pages 77, 78.
                         God's Beneficent Provision
  3. What beneficent provision has God made that man may
know the way of life? Ps. 119:104; Rom. 3:20, last part.

   NoTE.—"Without the law, men have no just conception of the purity and
holiness of God, or of their own guilt and uncleanness. They have no true con-
viction of sin, and feel no need of repentance."—The Great Controversy,
page 468.
   4. By what means does God make man conscious of his devia-
tion from the law of God? John 8:9; 1 John 3:21.

   NOTE.—"This daily review of our acts, to see whether conscience approves
or condemns, is necessary for all who wish to arrive at the perfection of
Christian character."—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 512.
                                           [3]
   5. What is the inevitable fate of those who reject God's coun-
sel? Prov. 15:9, first part; Ps. 37:38.

    NOTE.—"A signpost was erected by God for those journeying through this
world. One arm of this signpost pointed out willing obedience to the Creator
as the road to felicity and life, while the other arm indicated disobedience as
the path to misery and death."—Prophets and Kings," page 179.

                            Sin and Redemption

  6. In earth's earliest days what tragedy befell the human race,
and how far-reaching have been its consequences? Rom. 5:12; 3:23.

   NoTE.—"By venturing to disregard the will of God upon one point, our first
parents opened the floodgates of woe upon the world. And every individual
who follows their example will reap a similar result."—Thoughts From the
Mount of Blessing, page 83.
  7. Since the law of God could not be set aside, to what task did
God set Himself? Rom. 3:24-26.                -

   8. What gracious provision did He make whereby the guilt of
transgression might be removed? Rom. 5:18, 19; 1 John 1:9.

   NOTE.—"The broken law of God demanded the life of the sinner. In all the
universe there was but one who could, in behalf of man, satisfy its claims.
Since the divine law is as sacred as God Himself, only 'one equal with God could
make atonement for its transgression. None but Christ could redeem fallen man
from the curse of the law, and bring him again into harmony with Heaven."
—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 63.
   9. What further provision has He made whereby the pardoned
sinner may be brought \into conformity to the will of .God? Rom.
8:3, 4.

    NOTE.—"The conditions of eternal life, under grace, are just what they were
in Eden,—perfect righteousness, harmony with God, perfect conformity to the
principles of His law. The standard of character presented in the Old Testa-
ment is the same that is presented in the New Testament. This standard is not
one to which we cannot attain. In every command or injunction that God
gives, there is a promise, the most positive, underlying the command. God
has made provision that we may become like unto Him, and He will accomplish
this for all who do not interpose a perverse will, and thus frustrate His grace."
—Thoughts From the Mount of Bussing, page 116.

                         MEM     -nplisFe Remnant
   10. What two essentials have always characterized the experi-
ence of those who avail themselves of the divine way of escape from
condemnation? Heb. 11:8; Acts 6:7; Rev. 14:12.
                                      [4]
   NOTE.—"In every age, from 'the midst of apostasy and rebellion, God
gathers out a people that are true to Him,—a people 'in whose heart is His
law.'"—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 338.

   11. When all have had the opportunity of accepting or reject-
ing God's gracious offer, what will God do? Acts 17:31, first part;
John 3:18.

  12. What will be the reward of those whom He approves?
Rom. 6:22.

   NOTE.—"The redeemed will be welcomed to the home that Jesus is preparing
for them. There their companions will not be the vile of earth, liars, idolaters,
the impure, and unbelieving ; but they will associate with those who have over-
come Satan, and through divine grace have formed perfect characters.. .
They are without fault before the great white throne, sharing the dignity and
the privileges of the angels."—Steps to Christ, pages 131, 132.
   13. Under the provision of the new covenant, what is accom-
plished for the believer? Heb. 10:15, 16.


                    Lesson 2, for January 8, 1949

                            The Decalogue
    MEMORY VERSE: "He that hath My commandments, and keepeth them, he it
is that loveth Me: and he that loveth Me shall be loved of My Father." John 14:21.
    STUDY HELPS: Taylor G. Bunch, "The Ten Commandments," pages 9-22;
"Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing," pages 73-81; "Patriarchs and Prophets,"
pages 303-314, 331-342.

                             God's Ten Words
  L What special privilege did God grant to Israel, and where
was it given? Rom. 3:1, 2; Neh. 9:13, 14.

   NoTt.—"The law was not spoken at this time exclusively for the benefit of
the Hebrews. God honored them by making them the guardians and keepers
of His law, but it was to be held as a sacred trust for the whole world."—
Patriarchs and Prophets, page 305.

   2. In what form did He set forth the principles of His moral
 government? Deut. 4:12, 13. Read Exodus 20:1-17.

    NOTE.—"Ten precepts, brief, comprehensive, and authoritative, cover the
 duty of man to God and to his fellow man; and all based upon the great
 fundamental principle of love."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 305.
                                       l o]
   "The first table containing the first, second, third, and fourth command-
ments, and comprehending the . . . reverence we owe and the religious service
we should render to Him. The second, containing the six last commandments,
and comprehending a complete system of ethics, or moral duties, which man
owes to his fellows. . . . By this division, the first table contains our duty to
God; the second, our duty to our neighbor."—Adam Clarke, Commentary,
note on Exodus 20:1.
  3. How did God indicate the unique character of the Ten Com-
mandment code? Ex. 24:12; Deut. 5:22.

   NotE.—"He [God] did not even then trust His precepts to the memory of
a people who were prone to forget His requirements, but wrote them upon
tables of stone. He would remove from Israel all possibility of mingling
heathen traditions with His holy precepts, or of confounding His require-
ments with human ordinances or customs."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 364.

                     Declared From the Beginning
   4. While the law of God was first set forth as the Decalogue at
Sinai, what evidence have we that it was God's standard of right-
eousness from the beginning? Rom. 4:15, last part; 5:13.

   NOTE.—"God's law is a transcript of His character, It was given to man in
the beginning as the standard of obedience. . . . At Sinai the law was given a
second tirne."—Testimanies, vol. 8, p. 207.
   5. Mention some examples of individuals being condemned
for disobedience of God's law. Gen. 3:6, 16-19; 4:10-12; 27:18, 19,
41-43; 31:19; 35:2.

    NOTE.—"From the very beginning of the great controversy in heaven, it
has been Satan's purpose to overthrow the law of God. It was to accomplish
this that he entered upon his rebellion against the Creator; and though he was
cast out of heaven, he has continued the same warfare upon the earth. To de-
ceive men, and thus lead them to transgress God's law, is the object which he
has steadfastly pursued."—The Great Controversy, page 582.

                 Still the Standard of Righteousness
   6. What was it prophetically declared Jesus would abolish on
Calvary? What had He no intention of abrogating? Dan. 9:27
(compare Matthew 27:51); Matt. 5:17-20.

   NOTE.—"While the Saviour's death brought to an end the law of types and
shadows, it did not in the least detract from the obligation of the moral law.
On the contrary, the very fact that it was necessary for Christ to die in order
to atone for the transgression of that law, proves it to be immutable."—
Patriarchs and Prophets, page 365.
                                      [6]
   7. Of what is commandment keeping an evidence? John 14:15;
15:10, 14.

   NOTE.—"There are only two classes in the world today, and only two
classes will be recognized in the judgment,—those who violate God's law, and
those who obey it. Christ gives the test by which to prove our loyalty or
disloyalty. `If ye love Me,' He says, 'keep My commandments.' "—Christ's
Object Lessons, page 283.
   "If we abide in Christ, if the love of God dwells in the heart, our feelings,
our thoughts, our actions, will be in harmony with the will of God. The
sanctified heart is in harmony with the precepts of God's law."—The Acts of
the Apostles, page 563.
   8. What testimony did Paul bear concerning the place of the
law in the life of faith and grace? Rom. 3:31.

   9. How complete will be the believer's conformity to the law
of God? James 2:8-12.

   10. How is such conformity with the law of God made pos-
sible in the life of the forgiven sinner? Phil. 2:13; Gal. 2:20.

  NOTE.-"It is the work of conversion and sanctification to reconcile men to
God, by bringing them into accord with the principles of His law."—The Great
Controversy, page 467.
                       The Law in the Last Days
   11. What will be the attitude of the children of God in contrast
to the lawlessness of the world in the last days? Rev. 14:12; 2 Tim.
3:1-5.
     NorE.—"With the setting aside of the Bible has come a turning away from
God's law. The doctrine that men are released from obedience to the divine
precepts, has weakened the force of moral obligation, and opened the floodgates
of iniquity upon the world. Lawlessness, dissipation, and corruption are
sweeping in like an overwhelming flood. Everywhere are seen envy, evil sur-
mising, hypocrisy, estrangement, emulation, strife, betrayal of sacred trusts,
indulgence of lust."—Prophets and Kings, page 624.
    "We are nearing the end of this earth's history, and God calls upon all to
lift the standard bearing the inscription, `Here are they that keep the com-
mandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.' "—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 292.
   12. What will be the reward of those who, by grace, remain
loyal to God and to His law? Rev. 22:14.

   NorE.—"Those principles that were made known to man in Paradise as the
great law of life, will exist unchanged in Paradise restored. When Eden shall
bloom on earth again, God's law of love will be obeyed by all beneath the sun."
—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, pages 80, 81.

                    Lesson 3, for January 15, 1949

                            No Other Gods
   MEMORY VERSE: "0 come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before
the Lord our Maker." 'Ps. 95:6.
   STUDY HELP: Taylor G. Bunch, "The Ten Commandments," pages 23-34.


                      The True Object of Worship

  1. In the first commandment what affirmation does God make,
and what is His legitimate demand? Ex. 20:1-3; Isa. 42:8; Ex. 23:13.

    NorE.—"Jehovah, the eternal, self-existent, untreated One, Himself the
Source and Sustainer of all, is alone entitled to supreme reverence and worship.
Man is forbidden to give to any other object the first place in his affections or
his service."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 305.
   2. On what grounds does God claim man's exclusive allegiance
and worship?
   ANSWER: a. For what He is. Ps. 99:5 ; 1 Tim. 1:17.
                b. For what He has done as Creator, Ps. 95:6; as Provider, Ps.
107:8; as Deliverer, Ex. 20:2; Col. 1:13.
    NorE.—"The seal of God's law is found in the fourth commandment. This
only, of all the ten, brings to view both the name and the title of the Lawgiver.
It declares Him to be the Creator of the heavens and the earth, and thus shows
His claim to reverence and worship above all others."—The Great Controversy,
page 452.
  3. What kind of worship does God expect from His creatures?
Deut. 6:5; Matt. 22:37, 38.

    NOTE. "There is allowed no separation of our affections from God. Nothing
is to divide our supreme love for Him or our delight in Hiin."—Testimonies,
vol. 1, p. 436.

           From Creator Worship to Creature Worship
   4. By what steps did man depart from the true worship of God?

22, 25.

   5. What forms of creature worship became prominent in ancient

   "In ancient Egypt everything that had life, great and small, beautiful or
disgusting, was idealized and deified, from the mighty monarch to the crawling
beetle, from the bull to the onion."—W. Senior, God's Ten Words, page 29.
   6. What other things have men made into gods and worshiped?
1 Tim. 6:10; Phil. 3:19.

    NOTE.—"Whatever we cherish that tends to lessen our love for God or to
interfere with the service due Him, of that do we make a god."—Patriarchs and
Prophets, page 305.           •
   7. What mental conceptions have been set up as gods and wor-
shiped? Col. 2:8.

    NOTE.—"It is as easy to make an idol of false doctrines and theories as to
fashion an idol of wood or stone. By misrepresenting the attributes of God,
Satan leads men to conceive of Him in a false character. With many, a philo-
sophical idol is enthroned in the place of, ehovah ; while the living God, as He
is revealed in His word, in Christ, and in the works of creation, is worshiped by
but few."—The Great Controversy, page 583.
                     False Gods Degrade and Ruin

  8. Why is the worship of false gods not merely foolish but
degrading? Rom. 1:28-32. •

   NOTE.—"It is a law of the human mind that by beholding we become
changed. Man will rise no higher than his conceptions of truth, purity, and
holiness. If the mind is never exalted above the level of humanity, if it is not
uplifted by faith to contemplate infinite wisdom and love, the man will be
constantly sinking lower and lower. The worshipers of false gods clothed
their deities with human attributes and passions, and        their standard of
character was degraded to the likeness of sinful humanity. They were defiled in
consequence."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 91.
   9. What will be the fate of all false gods and of those who per-
sist in worshiping them? Jer. 10:11, 15; Rev. 22:15.

                             God's Last Appeal
    10. In what forms will false worship culminate in the last days?
2 Tim. 3:4, last part; 2 Peter 3:3; 1 Tim. 4:1; Rev. 13:4, 15.

     NoTE.—"The present age is one of idolatry, as verily as was that in which
 Elijah lived. No outward shrine may be visible; there may be no image for the
 eye to rest upon; yet thousands are following after the gods of this world,—
 after riches, fame, pleasure, and the pleasing fables that permit man to follow
 the inclinations of the unregenerate heart."—Prophets and Kings, page 177.
     11. How is God seeking to recall man to the worship of Him-
 .,elf? Rev. 14:6, 7.
                                       [9]
    NorE.—"In the last days of this earth's history, the voice that spoke from
Sinai is still declaring, 'Thou shalt have no other gods before Me.' Man has set
his will against the will of God, but he cannot silence the word of command.
The human mind cannot evade its obligation to a higher power. Theories and
speculations may abound; men may try to set science in opposition to revela-
tion, and thus do away with God's law; but stronger and still stronger comes
the command, 'Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou
serve."—Prophets and Kings, pages 624, 625.
   12. What, therefore, are we urged to do if we would partake of
the joys of the eternal kingdom? 1 Cor. 10:14; 1 John 5:21.

    NOTE. "Whatever divides the affections, and takes away from the soul
supreme love to God, assumes the form of an idol. Our carnal hearts would
cling to our idols and seek to carry them along; but we cannot advance until
we put them away, for they separate us from God. The great Head of the
church has chosen His people out of the world and requires them to be separate.
He designs that the spirit of His commandments shall draw them to Himself
and separate them from the elements of the world."—Testimonies, vol. 1, p. 289.



                   Lesson 4, for January 22, 1949

                            True Worship
  MEMORY VERSE: "And let them make Me a sanctuary; that I may dwell
among them." Ex. 25:8.
  STUDY HELP: Taylor G. Bunch, "The Ten Commandments," pages 35-63.

                         The Spirit of Devotion
  1. How is God described, and how only may He be worshiped?
John 4:24.

   NOTE.—"Not by seeking a holy mountain or a sacred temple are men
brought into communion with heaven. Religion is not to be confined to external
forms and ceremonies. The religion that comes from God is the only religion
that will lead to God. In order to serve Him aright, we must be born of the
divine Spirit. This will purify the heart and renew the mind, giving us a new
capacity for knowing and loving God. It will give us a willing obedience to all
His requirements. This is true worship."—The Desire of Ages, page 189.

   2. What legitimate aids were afforded to ancient Israel to assist
their worship of the invisible God? Ex. 25:8, 9.

   NoTE.—"The whole worship of ancient Israel was a promise, in figures and
symbols, of Christ; and it was not merely a promise, but an actual provision,
designed by God to aid millions of people by lifting their thoughts to Him who
was to manifest Himself to our world."—Testimonies to Ministers, page 123.
                                     10
   3. How has Jesus made God real to us? John 14:8-11; Heb. 1:1-3.

    NOTE.—"Christ declares Himself to be sent into the world as a representa-
tive of the Father. In His nobility of character, in His mercy and tender pity,
in His love and goodness, He stands before us as the embodiment of divine
perfection, the image of the invisible God."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 739.
                              Images a Snare

   4. In worship what was man expressly forbidden to use? Ex.
20:4, 5; Deut. 4:15-19.

   NOTE.—"In what does it (the second commandment) differ from the first?
The first forbade the worship of any false god with or without an image, sun,
moon, stars, Baal, or Ashtoreth. The second forbids even the worship of Je-
hovah Himself under any symbolic form whatever."—W. Senior, God's Ten
Words, page 48.
   5. In what perversion of worship do images ultimately result?
Isa. 44:9, 14, 16, 17.

    NOTE.—"It may have seemed strange to many of us, that among the Ten
Commandments which were to set forth in the shortest possible form the
highest, the most essential duties of man, the second place should be assigned
to a prohibition of any kind of images. . .. Let those who wish to understand
the hidden wisdom of these words study the history of ancient religions. Let
them read the descriptions of religious festivals in Africa, in America, and
Australia. . . . History is sometimes a stronger and sterner teacher than argu-
ment, and one of the lessons which the history of religions certainly teaches is
this, that the curse pronounced against those who would change the invisible
into the visible, the spiritual into the material, the divine into the human, the
infinite into the finite, has come true in every nation on earth."—Max Muller,
quoted by W. Senior in God's Ten Words, pages 59, 60.

                        How the Gospel Delivers
  6. How utterly foolish and profitless is the worship of graven
images? Isa. 44:10, 18-20; 45:20; 46:7.

   7. What features that may be witnessed in modern image wor-
ship characterized that of apostate Israel? Hosea 13:1-3; 1 Kings
19:18; Ezek. 16:17-20; 8:10, 11.

   NOTE.—"The worship of images and relics, the invocation of saints, and the
exaltation of the pope, are devices of Satan to attract the minds of the people
from God and from His Son. To accomplish their ruin, he endeavors to turn
their attention from Him through whom alone they can find salvation. He will
direct them to any object that can be substituted for the One who has said,
`Come unto Me.' "—The Great Controversy, page 568.
                                     [11 1
    8. How has Rome endeavored to conceal her violation of the
 second commandment?
     ANSWER: By substituting as far as possible the reading of catechisms for
• the reading of the Bible. In these catechisms the Decalogue is so markedly
  abridged as to amount to a change. In Butler's Catechism the first command-
  ment is thus given: "I am the Lord, thy God; thou shalt not have strange gods
  before Me." The second is given: "Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord
 thy God in vain." Assuming that what we call the second commandment is a
  part of the first, they omit all reference to graven images as presented in Exodus
20:4. In order to present ten commandments, the catechism makes two com-
 mandments of the tenth as we understand it. Their ninth commandment reads:
 "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife." Their tenth reads: "Thou shalt not
 covet thy neighbor's goods." In this way the command against the making of,
 or bowing down to, graven images is hidden from view.
     NOTE.—"There are twenty-nine catechisms in use in Rome and Italy,
 France, Belgium, Austria, Bavaria, Silesia, Poland, Ireland, England, Spain,
 and Portugal, in twenty-seven of which the second commandment is totally
 omitted; in two, mutilated."—Dr. McCaul, quoted by R. H. Charles, in The
  Decalogue, page 74.
   9. Is idolatry necessarily limited to the worship of images of
 wood, metal, or stone? Ezek. 14:3.

    NoTE.—A false philosophy to which a man gives his acquiescence, and in
 which he trusts rather than God, may become to him an idol. Science, evolu-
 tion, education, reason, progress, civilization, humanism, all forms of state
 worship and secular idealisms, are some of the "idols" to which modern man is
 giving his allegiance today rather than to God.
                               A "Jealous" God
   10. How does God feel toward idol worship, ancient or modern?
 Ex. 20:5. See also Deuteronomy 32:16; 32:21.

    NoTE.—"The close and sacred relation of God to His people is represented
 under the figure of marriage. Idolatry being spiritual adultery, the displeasure
 of God against it is fitly called jealousy."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 306.
    11. What will be the ultimate fate of those who fail to abandon
 their idols? Hosea 8:4.

    12. How will God regard those who love and obey Him? Ex.
20:6.
     NOTE.—" 'Showing mercy unto thousands of them that love Me, and keep
 My commandments.' In prohibiting the worship of false gods, the second
 commandment by implication enjoins the worship of the true God. And to
 those who are faithful in His service, mercy is promised, not merely to the
 third and fourth generation as is the wrath threatened against those who hate
 Him, but to thousands of generations."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 306.

                   Lesson 5, for January 29, 1949

                          The Holy Name
   MEMORY VERSE: "Give unto the Lord the glory due unto His name; worship
the Lord in the beauty of holiness." Ps. 29:2.
   STUDY HELPS: Taylor G. Bunch, "The Ten Commandments," pages 64-76;
"Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing," pages 102-106, 157, 158.

                      "Hallowed Be Thy Name"
   1. What do the Scriptures say of the name of God? Ps. 111:9,
last part; Ps. 29:2.

   Nom.—"The Scripture declares of God, 'Holy and reverend is His name.'
To what human being is such a title [reverend] befitting? How little does man
reveal of the wisdom and righteousness it indicates! How many of those who
assume this title are misrepresenting the name and character of God! Alas,
how often have worldly ambition, despotisni, and the basest sins, been hidden
under the broidered garments of a high and holy office I"—The Desire of Ages,
page 613.
  2. How, then, should the name of God be regarded by man?
Matt. 6:9.

    Nom.—"Holy angels have been displeased and disgusted with the irreverent
manner in which many have used the name of God, the great Jehovah. Angels
mention that sacred name with the greatest awe, ever veiling their faces when
they speak the name of God; and the name of Christ is so sacred to them that
they speak it with the greatest reverence."—Testimonies, vol. 1, p. 410.
    "To hallow the name of the Lord requires that the words in which we speak
of the Supreme Being be uttered with reverence."—Thoughts From the Mount
of Blessing, page 157.
    "Never should that name be spoken lightly or thoughtlessly. Even in
prayer its frequent or needless repetition should be avoided."—Education,
page 243.

   3. Of what should man never be guilty? Ex. 20:7; Lev. 19:12,
last part.

   NOTE.—"This commandment not only prohibits false oaths and common
swearing, but it forbids us to use the name of God in a light or careless manner,
without regard to its awful significance. By the thoughtless mention of God in
common conversation, by appeals to Him in trivial matters, and by the frequent
and thoughtless repetition of His name, we dishonor Him."—Patriarchs and
Prophets, pages 306, 307.

                   The Name of the Lord Profaned
  4. How did God's people of old profane the name of the Lord
among the heathen? Ezek. 36:20, 23. See Leviticus 18:21.
                                      [13 1
    NorE.—"God had pleaded with Judah not to provoke Him to anger, but
they had hearkened not. Finally sentence was pronounced against them. They
were to be led away captive to Babylon. The Chaldeans were to be used as the
instrument by which God would chastise His disobedient people. The sufferings
of the men of Judah were to be in proportion to the light they bad had, and
to the warnings they had despised and rejected. Long had God delayed His
judgments; but now He would visit His displeasure upon them, as a last effort
to check them in their evil course."—Prophets and Kings, page 425.
  5. What terrible guilt is incurred by the misrepresentation of
God by His people? 2 Sam. 12:14; Rom. 2:23, 24.

   6. In what other way may professing believers profane the name
of God? Luke 6:46; Matt. 15:7, 8.

   NorE.—"Open apostasy would not be more offensive to God than hypocrisy
and mere formal worship."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 523.
   7. How will God regard hypocrites? Matt. 7:21-23.

   NorE.—"Ten thousand times ten thousand may profess to obey the law
and the gospel, and yet be living in transgression. Men may present in a clear
manner the claims of truth upon others, and yet their own hearts be carnal.
Sin may be loved and practiced in secret. The truth of God may be no truth to
them, because their hearts have not been sanctified by it. The love of the
Saviour may exercise no constraining power over their base passions. We know
by the history of the past that men may stand in sacred positions, and yet
handle the truth of God deceitfully."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 536.

                          Invoking God's Name
  8. In what legitimate way may the name of God be invoked?
Deut. 6:13; Dan. 12:7; Rev. 10:5, 6.

    NOTE.-"Our Saviour did not . . . forbid the use of the judicial oath, in
which God is solemnly called to witness that what is said is truth, and nothing
but the truth. Jesus Himself, at His trial before the Sanhedrin, did not refuse
to testify under oath. The high priest said unto Him, 'I adjure Thee by the
living God, that Thou tell us whether Thou be the Christ, the Son of God.'
Jesus answered, 'Thou hast said.' Matt. 26:63, 64. Had Christ, in the Sermon
on the Mount, condemned the judicial oath, He would at His trial have re-
proved the high priest, and thus, for the benefit of His followers, have en-
forced His own teaching."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, page 104.
    "If there is anyone who can consistently testify under oath, it is the Chris-
tian. . . . When required to do so in a lawful manner, it is right for him to
appeal to God as a witness that what he says is the truth, and nothing but the
truth."—Ibid., pages 104, 105.
   9. What proper reticence, however, should we exercise even
in this solemn act? Matt. 5:34-37.
                                     [ 141
   NoTE.—"These words [verse 37] condemn all those meaningless phrases
and expletives that border on pro fanity."—Thoughts From the Mount of
Blessing, page 105.
   "Some exaggerate in their language. Some swear by their own life; others
swear by their head—as sure as they live ; as sure as they have a head. Some
take heaven and earth to witness that such things are so. Some hope that God
will strike them out of existence if what they are saying is not true. It is this
kind of common swearing against which Jesus warns His disciples."—Testi-
monies, vol. 1, p. 201.
  10. What does Paul urge all believers to put away? Col. 3:8;
Eph. 5:4.

               Attitude to God's Name in Latter Days
   11. How widespread will be the profanation of God's name in
the latter days? Rev. 13:1, 5, 6; 2 Tim. 3:5.

   12. What special regard will God have for those who in the
last days revere His name? How will they be rewarded? Mal.
3:16; 4:2; Rev. 11:18.

    NoTE.—"God will remember those who have met together and thought
upon His name, and He will spare them from the great conflagration. They will
be as precious jewels in His sight ; but His wrath will fall on the shelterless head
of the sinner."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 107.
   13. How universally will the name of the Lord be reverenced in
the new earth? Isa. 59:19.

    NOTE.-"With unutterable delight the children of earth enter into the joy
and wisdom of unfallen beings. They share the treasures of knowledge and
understanding gained through ages upon ages in contemplation of God's handi-
work. With undimmed vision they gaze upon the glory of creation,—suns and
stars and systems, all in their appointed order circling the throne of Deity.
Upon all things, from the least to the greatest, the Creator's name is written,
and in all are the riches of His power displayed."—The Great Controversy,
pages 677, 678.


          "Take the Bible, and on your knees plead with God
      to enlighten your mind. If we would study the Bible
      diligently and prayerfully every day, we should every
      day see some beautiful truth in a new, clear, and for-
      cible light."—Mrs. E. G. White, Review and Herald,
      March 4, 1884.

                    Lesson 6, for February 5, 1949

                        Creation's Memorial
   MEMORY VERSE: "And He said unto them, The Sabbath was made for man,
and not man for the Sabbath." Mark 2:27.
   STUDY HELP: Taylor G. Bunch, "The Ten Commandments," pages 77-90.

                        Remembering the Creator
   1. What fundamental difference between the power of the true
God and false gods should be recognized in worship? Jer.
10:10-12; Ps. 96:5.

    NOTE.—"The duty to worship God is based upon the fact that He is the
Creator, and that to Him all other beings owe their existence.' And wherever,
in the Bible, His claim to reverence and worship, above the gods of the heathen,
is presented, there is cited the evidence of His creative power. . . . 'This great
fact can never become obsolete, and must never be forgotten.' "—The Great
Controversy, pages 436-438.
   2. What period of time was particularly set apart for the wor-
ship of the Creator, and why? Ex. 20:8-11. See.also Genesis 2:1-3.

   NorE.—"The Sabbath, as a memorial of God's creative power, points to
Him as the Maker of the heavens and the earth. Hence it is a constant witness
to His existence and a reminder of His greatness, His wisdom, and His love.
Had the Sabbath always been sacredly observed, there could never have been
an atheist or an idolater."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 336.
   3. How specifically are the bounds of the Sabbath defined?
Lev. 23:32, last part; Neh. 13:19 (compare Mark 1:21, 32); Luke
4:31, 40.

    NOTE.—"All through the week we are to hav,e the Sabbath in mind, and be
making preparation to keep it according to the commandment."—Testimonies,
vol. 6, p. 353.
   "When the Sabbath commences, we should place a guard upon ourselves,
upon our acts and our words, lest we rob God by appropriating to our own use
that time which is strictly the Lord's."—I bid., vol. 2, p. 702.
   4. In view of His participation in the work of creation what
claim was Jesus also justified in making? Mark 2:28.

    NOTE.—"It belongs to Christ. For 'all things were made by Him; and with-
out Him was not anything made that was made.' Since He made all things, He
made the Sabbath. By Him it was set apart as a memorial of the work of
creation. It points to Him as both the Creator and the Sanctifier."—The Desire
of Ages, page 288.
                                     [ 16
           Universality and Perpetuity of the Sabbath
   5. For whom was the Sabbath made? Mark 2:27.

   NOTE.—"In Eden; God set up the memorial of His work of creation, in
placing His blessing upon the seventh day. The Sabbath was committed to
Adam, the father and representative of the whole human family. Its ob-
servance was to be an act of grateful acknowledgment, on the part of all who
should dwell upon the earth, that God was their Creator and their rightful
Sovereign; that they were the work of His hands, and the subjects of His
authority."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 48.
  6.— How is the universality of the Sabbath emphasized? Ex:
20:10, last part; 23:12; Isa. 56:6, 7.


   7. How do we know that the Sabbath antedated Sinai? Gen.
2:1-3; Ex. 16:23-26.

    NOTE.—"God's sanctifying the day is equivalent to His commanding men
to sanctify it. As at the close of creation the seventh day was then set apart by
the Most High for such purpose, without limitation to age or country, the
observance of it is obligatory upon the whole human race.... The sanctification
of the seventh day in the present case can only be understood of its being set
apart to the special worship and service of God."—G. Bush, Notes on Genesis,
vol. 1, pp. 47-49.
    "The Sabbath is not introduced as a new institution but as having been
founded at creation. It is to be remembered and observed as the memorial of
the Creator's work."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 307.
  8. What convincing evidence have- we that the Sabbath would
continue to be obligatory in the Christian Era? Matt. 24:20.

    NOTE.—Jesus knew that Jerusalem would not fall until many years after
His death. Obviously, then, He expected that the Christians would continue
worshiping "according to the commandment," even as they had always done.
Never once did He suggest that His death and resurrection would make any
difference to the Sabbath. As they had worshiped on the seventh-day Sabbath
during the time He spent on earth with therh, so He expected them to con-
tinue after He left them. And if the seventh-day Sabbath was observed by the
Christians forty years after the resurrection, when Jerusalem fell, can thete be
the slightest justification for not observing it four hundred years after, or
fourteen hundred years after, or nineteen hundred years after?

                           A Sign of Allegiance
  9. What significance would the Sabbath all down the ages
have for God and man? Ex. 31:13; Ezek. 20:12, 20.

    NoTE.—"Pointing to God as the Maker. of the heavens and the earth, it
                                      [ 17 3
distinguishes the true God from all false gods. All who keep the seventh day,
signify by this act that they are worshipers of Jehovah. Thus the Sabbath is the
sign of man's allegiance to God as long as there are any upon the earth to serve
Him."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 307.

   10. What is forbidden on the Sabbath day, and why? Ex. 20:10,
11; 23:12.

    NOTE.—"The law forbids secular labor on the rest day of the Lord; the toil
that gains a livelihood must cease ; no labor for worldly pleasure or profit is
lawful upon that day; but as God ceased His labor of creating, and rested upon
the Sabbath and blessed it, so man is to leave the occupations of his daily life,
and devote those sacred hours to healthful rest, to worship, and to holy deeds."
—The Desire of Ages, page 207.
   "Those who discuss business matters or lay plans on the Sabbath, are re-
garded by God as though engaged in the actual transaction of business. To
keep the Sabbath holy, we should not even allow our minds to dwell upon
things of a worldly character."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 307.
   11. How is the time of the Sabbath to be used? Lev. 23:3, first
part; Luke 4:16.

   12. What works are commendable on the Sabbath day? Matt.
12:10-12.

    NoTE.—"Nature must continue her unvarying course. God could not for a
moment stay His hand, or man would faint and die. And man also has a work
to perform on this day. The necessities of life must be attended to, the sick
must be cared for, the wants of the needy must be supplied. He will not be held
guiltless who neglects to relieve suffering on the Sabbath. God's holy rest day
was made for man, and acts of mercy are in perfect harmony with its intent.
God does not desire His creatures to suffer an hour's pain that may be relieved
upon the Sabbath or any other day."—The Desire of Ages, page 207.
   13. What is promised to those who rightly observe the Sab-
bath? Isa. 58:13, 14.

    NOTE.—"All heaven was represented to me as beholding and watching upon
the Sabbath those who acknowledge the claims of the fourth commandment
and are observing the Sabbath. Angels were marking their interest in, and high
regard for, this divine institution. Those who sanctified the Lord God in their
hearts by a strictly devotional frame of mind, and who sought to improve the
sacred hours in keeping the Sabbath to the best of their ability, and to honor
God by calling the Sabbath a delight,—these the angels were specially blessing
with light and health, and special strength was given them."—Testimonies, -
vol. 2, pp. 704, 705.
   14. In what special way will God's creative work continue to
be remembered? Isa. 66:23.
                                      [18]
    NoTE.—"When there shall be a 'restitution of all things, which God bath
spoken by the mouth of all His holy prophets since the world began,' the cre-
ation Sabbath, the day on which Jesus lay at rest in Joseph's tomb, will still be
a day of rest and rejoicing. Heaven and earth will unite in praise, as 'from one
Sabbath to another' the nations of the saved shall bow in joyful worship to
God and the Lamb."—The Desire of Ages, pages 769, 770.

ment with promise; that it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the
earth." Eph. 6:2, 3.
   STUDY HELPS: Taylor G. Bunch, "The Ten Commandments," pages 91-109;
"Christ's Object Lessons," pages 198-211 (new ed., pages 201-213); "Messages to
Young People," pages 325-340.

                          Parental Responsibility
   1. What institution besides the Sabbath was established in the
beginning? How did God complete the first family circle? Gen.
2:20-24; 5:3-5.

   NoTE.—"The heart of the community, of the church, and of the nation, is
the household. The well-being of society, the success of the church, the pros-
perity of the nation, depend upon home influences."—The Ministry of Healing,
page 349.
   "God designs that the families of earth shall be a symbol of the family in
heaven. Christian homes, established and conducted in accordance with God's
plan, are among His most effective agencies for the formation of Christian
character and for the advancement of His work."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 430.
  2. What responsibilities devolve upon parents? 1 Tim. 5:8;
Deut. 6:3-7.

    NoTa.—"The family circle is the school in which the child receives its first
and most enduring lessons. Hence parents should be much at home. By pre-
cept and example, they should teach their children the love and the fear of God ;
teach them to be intelligent, social, affectionate, to cultivate habits of industry,
economy, and self-denial."—Fundamentals of Christian Education, page 65.
    "To a great extent, parents hold in their own hands the future happiness of
their children. Upon them rests the important work of forming the character
of these children. The instructions given in childhood will follow them all
through life."—Testimonies, vol. 1, p. 393.
                        Children's Debt to Parents
  3. What corresponding debt do children owe their parents?
Ex. 20:12.
                                       [ 19 ] •
    NOTE.—"Parents are entitled to a degree of love and respect which is due to
no other person. God Himself, who has placed upon them a responsibility for
the souls committed to their charge, has ordained that during the earlier years
of life, parents shall stand in the place of God to their children. And he who
rejects the rightful authority of his parents, is rejecting the authority of God."
—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 308.
    "One of the first lessons a child needs to learn is the lesson of obedience.
Before he is old enough to reason, he may be taught to obey. By gentle, per-
sistent effort, the habit should be established. Thus, to a great degree, may be
prevented those later conflicts between will and authority that do so much to
create alienation and bitterness toward parents and teachers, and too often
resistance of all authority, human and divine."—Education, page 287.
  4. Should obedience to parents be merely the fulfilling of a
duty? Prov. 23:46: g q A. 6

   NorE.—"The fifth commandment requires children not only to yield respect,
submission, and obedience to their parents, but also to give them love and
tenderness, to lighten their cares, to guard their reputation, and to succor and
comfort them in old age."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 308.
   5. What example of filial devotion did Jesus set? Luke 2:51, 52.

    NOTE.—"Jesus is our example. There are many who dwell with interest
upon the period of his public ministry, while they pass unnoticed the teaching
of His early years. But it is in His home life that He is the pattern for all
children and youth. . . . And every youth who follows Christ's example of
faithfulness and obedience in His lowly home may claim those words spoken of
Him by the Father through the Holy Spirit, 'Behold My servant, whom I up-
hold; Mine elect, in whom My soul delighteth.' "—The Desire of Ages, page 74.

ment? Matt. 19:19, first part; 15:4-6.

  7. In what language does Paul stress its continued obligation?
Eph. 6:1; Col. 3:20.

                          Rewards of Obedience

   8. In what is the fifth commandment unique? Eph. 6:2, 3.

   NoTE.—"This is not a subject unworthy of notice, but a matter of vital
importance. The promise is upon condition of obedience. If you obey you
shall live long in the land which the Lord your God gives you. If you disobey
you shall not prolong your life in that land."—Testimonies, vol. 2, pp. 80, 81.
   "Children who dishonor and disobey their parents, and disregard their ad-
vice and instructions, can have no part in the earth made new. The purified
new earth will be no place for the rebellious, the disobedient, the ungrateful,
son or daughter. Unless such learn obedience and submission here, they will
                                      f 20 l
never learn it; the peace of the ransomed will not be marred by disobedient,
unruly, unsubmissive children."—Testimonies, vol. 1, pp. 497, 498.
   9. What rewards does the commandment bring with it? Prov.
4:20-22; 3:1, 2.

   NcrrE.—"Our youth profess to be among those who keep the command-
ments of God, and yet many of them neglect and break the fifth command-
ment; and the rich blessing promised to those who observe this precept, and
honor father and mother, cannot be fulfilled to them."—Messages to Young
People, page 331.
                  Children Bring Blessing or Sorrow

   10. How does filial devotion enrich the life of parents? Prov.
23:24, 25; 29:17.

    NOTE.—"If your children come forth from the home training pure and,
virtuous; if they fill the least and lowest place in God's great plan of good for
the world, your life can never be called a failure, and can never be reviewed
with remorse."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 44.
    "When the judgment shall sit, and the books shall be opened; when the
`well done' of the great Judge is pronounced, and the crown of immortal glory
is placed upon the brow of the victor, many will raise their crowns in sight of
the assembled universe and, pointing to their mother, say, `She made me all
I am through the grace of God. Her instruction, her prayers, have been blessed
to my eternal salvation.' "—Messages to Young People, page 330.
  11. What sorrow will the wayward child bring? Luke 15:11-13.
See also Proverbs 17:25.

    NOTE.—"Little did the gay, thoughtless youth, as he went out from his
father's gate, dream of the ache and longing left in that father's heart. When
he danced and feasted with his wild companions, little did he think of the
shadow that had fallen on his home."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 203.
   "Many fathers and mothers have gone down brokenhearted to the grave
because of the ingratitude, the lack of respect, shown them by their children."
—Messages to Young People, page 332.
  12. What joy did the return of a prodigal bring to his parents?
Luke 15:13:32.

                              Draw Together

   13. What will be prominent among the sins of the last days,
and what tragic consequences will result? 2 Tim. 3:1-3; Mark
13:12.

    NorE:—"Perhaps no sign of the present time is more sad than the preva-
                                  [ 21
lence of disobedience on the part of children to parents during the days of
childhood, and lack of reverence and respect when once the restraints of home
have been left behind."—G. Campbell Morgan, The Ten Commandments,
page 62.
   14. When the church is faced with this menace, what will the
Elijah message do for the people of God? Mal. 4:5, 6; Luke 1:17.



                   Lesson 8, for February 19, 1949

                            The Gift of Life

"Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing," pages 87-90; "Patriarchs and Prophets,"
pages 74-77; "The Acts of the Apostles," pages 568, 577.

                                A Sacred Gift
   1. To whom does man owe the gift of life? Gen. 2:7.

  NOTE. "Life is mysterious and sacred. It is the manifestation of God Him-
self, the Source of all life."—The Ministry of Healing, page 397.
  2. What prohibition does the sixth commandment enjoin?
Ex. 20:13.

    NOTE.—"Life may be taken accidentally, or in self-defense, or even in
shocking carelessness, all which is homicide, but not murder. To constitute
murder, life must be taken evilly and willfully. There must be present in the
act personal feeling, bate, or revenge, or covetousness. It is this personal feeling
which makes murder awful, and which sends a thrill of horror through the land
as the national conscience is confronted with the hideous sin."—W. Senior,
God's Ten Words, page 219.

                          Murder and Its Motive
  3. Where do we find the earliest recorded breach of the sixth
commandment? Gen. 4:8-10.

   4. What was the motive for Cain's sin? Gen. 4:5, 8; 1 John
3:12.

   NoTE.—"Cain hated and killed his brother not for any wrong that Abel

So in all ages the wicked have hated those who Were better than themselves."

man? 2 Kings 21:23, 24._

   6. What divine condemnation does the murderer incur? Ps.
5:6, last part; Prov. 6:16, 17.

   7. How may the sixth commandment be broken without
actually taking the life of another? Matt. 5:21, 22; 1 John 3:15.

    NOTE.—"Our Lord makes plain the very spirit of the law, and so confronts
the true spirit within us by teaching that there may be murder without any
killing, or wound, or even blow. He carries it down from the deed of the hand
to the feeling of the heart: . .. passion, hate, malice, covetousness, ill temper.
     In the sight of the Searcher of hearts, all evil anger, malicious feeling, and
unforgiving temper is the spirit of murder."—W. Senior, God's Ten Words,
page 232.
    "All acts of injustice that tend to shorten life; the spirit of hatred and
revenge, or the indulgence of any passion that leads to injurious acts toward
others, or causes us even to wish them harm (for 'whoso hateth his brother is
a murderer') ; a selfish neglect of caring for the needy or suffering; all self-
indulgence or unnecessary deprivation or excessive labor that tends to injure
health,—all these are, to a greater or less degree, violations of the sixth corn-
mandment."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 308.

                         God's People Persecuted
. 8. What have the people of God sometimes suffered for their
  faith? Heb. 11:36-38; Matt. 24:9.

     NOTE.—"In all ages God's appointed witnesses have exposed themselves to
 reproach and persecution for the truth's sake. Joseph was maligned and perse-
 cuted because he preserved his virtue and integrity. David, the chosen messen-
 ger of God, was hunted like a beast of prey by his enemies. Daniel was cast into
 a den of lions because he was true to his allegiance to heaven. Job was deprived
 of his worldly possessions, and so afflicted in body that he was abhorred by his
 relatives and friends; yet he maintained his integrity. Jeremiah could not be
 deterred from speaking the words that God had given him to speak; and his
 testimony so enraged the king and princes that he was cast into a loathsome pit.
 Stephen was stoned because he preached Christ and Him crucified. Paul was
 imprisoned, beaten with rods, stoned, and finally put to death because he was
 a faithful messenger for God to the Gentiles. And John was banished to the
 Isle of Patmos 'for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.' "
  —The Acts of the Apostles, page 575.
    9. How will the bloodguiltiness of the persecutors recoil upon
 their own heads? Rev. 18:6, 24; Matt. 23:34-36.
                               123]
    NOTE.—"Not long hence they will stand before the Judge of all the earth,
to render an account for the pain they have caused to the bodies and souls of
His heritage. . . . They may consign His believing ones to prison, to the chain
gang, to banishment, to death; but for every pang of anguish, every tear shed,
they must answer. God will reward them double for their sins."—Christ's
Object Lessons, pages 178, 179.

   10. In what ways will the spirit of evil manifest itself in the
last days? Luke 21:9, 10 (compare Genesis 6:11); Rev. 13:15; Matt:
24:9, 10.


    NOTE.—"The remnant church will be brought into great trial and distress.
Those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus, will feel the
ire of the dragon and his hosts. Satan numbers the world as his subjects, he has
gained control of the apostate churches; but here is a little company that are
resisting his supremacy. If he could blot them from the earth, his triumph
would be complete. As he influenced the heathen nations to destroy Israel, so
in the near future he will stir up the wicked powers of.earth to destroy the
people of God."—Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 231.

   11. How will God's people deport themselves under persecu-
tion? Matt. 5:38, 39.


    NOTE.—"Satan's attacks against the advocates of the truth will wax more
bitter and determined to the very close of time. . . . The people will be led to
acts of violence and opposition. . . . What course shall the advocates of truth
pursue? They have the unchangeable, eternal word of God, and they should
reveal the fact that they have the truth as it is in Jesus. Their words must not
be rugged and sharp. In their presentation of truth they must manifest the love
and meekness and gentleness of Christ. Let the truth do the cutting; the word
of God is as a sharp, two-edged sword, and will cut its way to the heart."
—Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 239.

   12. What will be the ultimate fate of the persecutors? 1 John
3:15; Rev. 21:8.


  13. What assurance does God give to His suffering people?
Rom. 12:19; Matt. 5:11, 12.


    NOTE.—"From garrets, from hovels, from dungeons, from scaffolds, from
mountains and deserts, from the caves of the earth and the caverns of the sea,
Christ will gather His children to Himself. On earth they have been destitute,
afflicted, and tormented. Millions have gone down to the grave loaded with
infamy because they refused to yield to the deceptive claims of Satan. By
human tribunals the children of God have been adjudged the vilest of criminals.
But the day is near when 'God is judge Himself.' Ps. 50:6. Then the decisions
of earth shall be reversed. 'The rebuke of His people shall He take away.'
Isaiah 25:8."—Christ's Object Lessons, pages 179, 180.
                                     [ 24 ]
                  Lesson 9, for February 26, 1949

                    Pure in Heart and Life
   MEMORY VERSE: ',Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God."
Matt. 5:8.
   STUDY HELPS: Taylor G. Bunch, "The Ten Commandments," pages 120-134;
"Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing," pages 93, 94.

                          A Sacred Relationship
   1. What relationship did God ordain in the creation of our first
parents? Matt. 19:4-6. See Genesis 2:20-24.


   NOTE.—"God celebrated the first marriage. Thus the institution has for its
originator the Creator of the universe. . . . When the divine principles are
recognized and obeyed in this relation, marriage is a blessing ; it guards the
purity and happiness of the race, it provides for man's social needs, it elevates
the physical, the intellectual, and the moral nature."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
page 46.
  2. How is family life safeguarded in the seventh command-
ment? Ex. 20:14.


    NOTE.—"The command is a simple, unqualified, irrevocable negative. 'Thou
shalt not !' No argument is used, no reason given, because none is required. The
sin is of so destructive and damning a nature that it is in itself sufficient cause
for the stern forbidding. . . . A sevenfold vice is this sin of unchaste conduct,
being sin against the individual, the family, society, the nation, the race, the
universe, and God."—G. Campbell Morgan, The Ten Commandments, page 78.
    3. What law inexorably operates in the life of man? Gal.
6:7, 8; 1 Cor. 15:33.

    NOTE.—"He who has once yielded to temptation will yield more readily the
second time. Every repetition of the sin lessens his power of resistance, blinds
his eyes, and stifles conviction. Every seed of indulgence sown will bear fruit.
God works no mirade to, prevent the harvest."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
page 268.

                             Secret of Stability
    4. To what may sensuality ultimately be traced? Rom. 1:28, 29.


     NOTE.—"Let the mind be directed to high and holy ideals, let the life have
 a noble aim, an absorbing purpose, and evil finds little foothold. Let the youth,
 then, be taught to give close study to the word of God. Received into the soul,
 it will prove a mighty barricade against temptation."—Education, page 190.
                                       [ 25 ]
  5. What was the stabilizing principle in the life of Joseph?
Gen. 39:9, last part.

   NOTE.—"Joseph's answer reveals the power of religious principle. He
would not betray the confidence of his master on earth, and, whatever the
consequences, he would be true to his Master in heaven. Under the inspecting
eye of God and holy angels, many take liberties of •which they would not be
guilty in the presence of their fellow men; but Joseph's first thought was of
God. 'How can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?' he, said." .
—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 217.
   6. By what power may the sinner be delivered from tempta-
tion? 2 Peter 2:9, first part; Col. 3:5; 1 Thess. 4:3-5.

    NoTE.—"If you draw close to Jesus, and seek to adorn your profession by a
well-ordered life and godly conversation, your feet will be kept from straying
into forbidden paths. If you will only watch, continually watch unto prayer,
if you will do everything as if you were in the immediate presence of God, you
will be saved from yielding to temptation, and may hope to be kept pure,
spotless, and undefiled till the last. . . . If Christ be within us, we shall crucify
the flesh with the affections and lusts."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 148.

                           Temple of God's Spirit
   7. Why are sins against the body so extremely wicked? What
do we owe God? 1 Cor. 6:15, 19, 20.

    NOTE.—"Is it true that all the powers of our being, our bodies, our spirits, ,
all that we have, and all we are, belong to God? It certainly is. And when we
realize this, what obligation does it lay us under to God to preserve ourselves
in that condition that we may honor Him upon the earth in our bodies and in
our spirits which are His."—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 354.
   8. What manner of life only is becoming to saints? 1 Thess.
4:7.

   NoTE.—"Nothing but purity, sacred purity, will stand the grand review,
abide the day of God, and be received into a pure and holy heaven."—Testi-
monies, vol. 2, p. 458.
                       Every Thought in Captivity
  9. How wide an application did Jesus give to the seventh
commandment? Matt. 5:28.

   NoTE.—"This commandment forbids not only acts of impurity, but sensual
thoughts and desires, or any practice that tends to excite them. Purity is de-
manded not only in the outward life, but in the secret intents and emotions of
the heart. Christ, who taught the far-reaching obligation of the law of God,
                                      26
declared the evil thought or look to be as truly sin as is the unlawful deed."
—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 308.
  10. What thoughts should possess the mind of the believer?
Phil. 4:8.

    NOTE.—"It is your duty to control your thoughts. You will have to war
against a vain imagination. You may think that there can be no sin in permit-
ting your thoughts to run as they naturally would without restraint. But this
is not so. You are responsible to God for the indulgence of vain thoughts; for
from vain imaginations arises the committal of sins, the actual doing of those
things upon which the mind has dwelt. Govern your thoughts, and it will thtn
be much easier to govern your actions. Your thoughts need to be sanctified."
—Testimonies, vol. 3, p. 82.
   11. By what means is control of the thoughts made possible?
2 Cor. 10:4, 5.

    Nora.—"It is for you to yield up your will to the will of Jesus Christ; and
as you do this, God will immediately take possession, and work in you to will
and to do of His good pleasure. Your whole nature will then be brought under
the control of the Spirit of Christ; and even your thoughts will be subject to
Him."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 514.

                           The Pure Remnant
   12. What figure is used symbolically of the righteous? Rev.
14:1, 4.

   13. Who only will be permitted to see God? Matt. 5:8.

    NOTE.—"The Bible is an unerring guide. It demands perfect purity in word,
in thought, and in action. Only virtuous and spotless characters will be per-
mitted to enter the presence of a pure and holy God."—Testimonies, vol. 4,
p. 312.
    "The pure in heart live as in the visible presence of God during the time He
apportions them in this world. And they will also see Him face to face in the
future,, immortal state, as did Adam when he walked and talked with God in
Eden."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, page 45.

                       Honesty in All Things
   MEMORY VERSE: "Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labor,
working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that
needeth." Eph. 4 :28.
   STUDY HELP: Taylor G. Bunch, "The Ten Commandments," pages 135-147..

                          The Right of Ownership
   1. By what commandment are the legitimate rights of possession
safeguarded? Ex. 20:15.

    NorE.—"Both public and private sins are included in this prohibition. The
eighth commandment condemns manstealing and slave dealing, and forbids
wars of conquest. It condemns theft and robbery. It demands strict integrity
in the minutest details of the affairs of life. It forbids overreaching in trade, and
requires the payment of just debts or wages. It declares that every attempt to
advantage one's self by the ignorance, weakness, or misfortune of another, is
registered as fraud in the books of heaven."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
page 309.
   2. What reward for diligent effort does God promise? Deut.
8:18.

    NorE.—"There is no sin in being rich, if riches are not acquired by in-
justice."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 266.

                        Warnings and Admonition
  3. What counsel was given the taxgatherers in Christ's day?
Luke 3:12, 13.

    NOTE.—"The great and holy and merciful God will never be in league with
dishonest practices; not a single touch of injustice will He vindicate."—Testi-
monies to Ministers, page 360.
   "Sin is sin, whether committed by the possessor of millions, or by the
beggar in the streets. Those who secure property by false representations are
bringing condemnation on their souls. All that is obtained by deceit and fraud
will be only a curse to the receiver."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 311.
   4. Against what temptation are employers warned? What
should all workers render? Lev. 19:13, 36; Titus 2:9, 10.

    NOTE.—"Were the principles of God's laws regarding the distribution of
property carried out in the world today, how different would be the condition
of the people! An observance of these principles would prevent the terrible
evils that in all ages have resulted from the oppression of the poor by the rich
                                       [ 28 ]
and the hatred of the rich by the poor. While it might hinder the amassing of
great wealth, it would tend to prevent the ignorance and degradation of tens
of thousands whose ill-paid servitude is required for the building up of these
colossal fortunes. It would aid in bringing a peaceful solution of problems that
now threaten to fill the world with anarchy and bloodshed."—Education,
page 44.
    "If a workman in the daily vocations of life is unfaithful, and slights his
work, the world will not judge incorrectly if they estimate his standard in
religion according to his standard in business."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 311.
   5.. What forms of dishonesty have been frequently used in
the course of buying and selling? Deut. 25:13-16; Amos 8:5, 6.

    NOTE.—"An honest man, according to Christ's measurement, is one who will
manifest unbending integrity. Deceitful weights and false balances, with which
many seek to advance their interests in the world, are abomination in the sight
of God. Yet many who profess to keep the commandments of God are dealing
with false weights and false balances."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 310.
    "It is neither the magnitude nor the seeming insignificance of a business
transaction that makes it fair or unfair, honest or dishonest. By the least
departure from rectitude we place ourselves on the enemy's ground, and may
go on, step by step, to any length of injustice. A large proportion of the Chris-
tian World divorce religion from their business. Thousands of little tricks and
petty dishonesties are practiced in dealing with their fellow men, which reveal
the true state of the heart, showing its corruption."—Ibid., vol. 4, p. 337.

                       Repentance and Restoration
   6. What course of action is required of a repentant thief? Ezek.
33:15, 16; Luke 19:8, 9.

    Nork.—"Every converted soul will, like Zacchaeus, signalize the entrance of
Christ into his heart by an abandonment of the unrighteous practices that have
marked his life. Like the chief publican, he will give proof of his sincerity by
making restitution. ... If we have injured others through any unjust business
transaction, if we have overreached in trade, or defrauded any man, even
though it be within the pale of the law, we should confess our wrong, and make
restitution as far as lies in our power. It is right for us to restore not only that
which we have taken, but all that it would have accumulated if put to a right
and wise use during the time it has been in our possession."—The Desire of
Ages, page 556.
    7. What antidote for stealing is recommended? Eph. 4:28.

   8. What example should the Christian set the unbeliever?
1 Peter 2:12; 2 Cor. 8:21; 7:2.

   No-rk.—"When a man is indeed connected with God, and is keeping His
law in truth, his life will reveal the fact; for all his actions will be in harmony
                                       [ 29 3
with the teachings of Christ. He will not sell his honor for gain. His principles
are built upon the sure foundation, and his conduct in worldly matters is a
transcript of his principles. Firm integrity shines forth as gold amid the dross
and rubbish of the world."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 310.

                                Robbing God
  9. In what other way, besides abusing the rights of fellow
men, is the eighth commandment broken? Mal. 3:8.

    NOTE.—"As a man deals with his fellow men, so will he deal with God. He
that is unfaithful in ale mammon of unrighteousness, will never be entrusted
with the true riches. The children of God should not fail to remember that in
all their business transactions they are being proved, weighed in the balances
of the sanctuary."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 311. -
   10. How are the results of honesty and dishonesty in this mat-
ter set forth? Amos 8:5; Mal. 3:8-10.

    Nora.—"If all who profess to be followers of Christ were truly sanctified,
their means, instead of being spent for needless and even hurtful indulgences,
would be turned into the Lord's treasury, and Christians would set an example
of temperance, self-denial, and self-sacrifice. Then they would be the light of
the world."—The Great Controversy, page 475.
    "Those who selfishly spend the Lord's gifts on themselves, leaving their
needy fellow creatures without aid, and doing nothing to advance God's work
in the world, dishonor their Maker. Robbery of God is written opposite their
names in the books of heaven."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 266.

                        Recompense and Reward
   11. How will sinful exploitation recoil upon the transgressors
in the last days? James 5:1-5; Ezek. 7:19.

    NcrrE.—"Riches bring with them great responsibilities. To obtain wealth by
unjust dealing, by overreaching in trade, by oppressing the widow and the
fatherless, or by hoarding up riches and neglecting the wants of the needy, will
eventually bring the just retribution described by the inspired apostle: `Go to
now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you.
Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth-eaten. Your gold and
silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you.' "—
Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 682.
  12. How does God counsel and encourage the exploited ones?
James 5:7.

   NorE.—"Belief in the near coming of the Son of man in the clouds of heaven
will not cause the true Christian to become neglectful and careless of the ordi-
nary business of life. The waiting ones who look for the soon appearing of
Christ will not be idle, but diligent in business. Their work will not be done
                                       30 ]
carelessly and dishonestly, but with fidelity, promptness, and thoroughness.
. . . Their veracity, faithfulness, and integrity are tested and proved in tem-
poral things. If they are faithful in that which is least, they will be faithful in
much."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 309.
   13. What are the honest in heart and life assured? Isa. 33:15, 16.

    NoTE.—"Whatever crosses they have been called to bear, whatever losses
they have sustained, whatever persecution they have suffered, even to the loss
of their temporal life, the children of God are amply recompensed. `They shall
see His face; and His name shall be in their foreheads.' Rev. 22:4."—Christ's
Object Lessons, page 180.

truly are His delight." Prov. 12:22.
   STUDY HELP: Taylor G. Bunch, "The Ten Commandments," pages 148-161.

                          The Use of the Tongue
  1. Against what sin of the tongue does the ninth command-
ment specifically warn? Ex. 20:16.

    NOTE.—"This precept forbids every effort to injure our neighbor's reputa-
tion by misrepresentation or evil surmising, by slander or talebearing. Even
the intentional suppression of truth, by which injury may result to others, is
a violation of the ninth commandment."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 309.
   2. In what worthy ways should the tongue be employed? Eph.
4:29; Ps. 145:5-7, 11, 12; 37:30; Job 16:5.

    NOTE.—"The Lord desires us to make mention of His goodness and tell of
His power. He is honored by the expression of praise and thanksgiving."—
Christ's Object Lessons, page 298.
    "Words of cheer and encouragement spoken when the soul is sick and the
pulse of courage is low,—these are regarded by the Saviour as if spoken to
Himself. As hearts are cheered, the heavenly angels look on in pleased recog-
nition."—The Ministry of Healing, page 159.
   3. What harm may the tongue work if uncontrolled? James
3:5, 6, 9, 10.

  NoTE.—"In one moment, by the hasty, passionate, careless tongue, may be
wrought evil that a whole lifetime's repentance cannot undo. Oh, the hearts
                                    [ 31 ]
that are broken, the friends estranged, the lives wrecked, by the harsh, hasty
words of those who might have brought help and healing !"—Education, pages
236,237.

   4. In what seemingly innocent way is this commandment often
violated? Lev. 19:16; Ex. 23:1.

    NoTE.—"There are some who, in order to tear down or injure the reputation
of another, will, from sheer malice, fabricate falsehoods concerning them."
—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 335.
    "Closely allied to gossip is the covert insinuation, the sly innuendo, by
which the unclean in heart seek to insinuate the evil they dare not openly
express. Every approach to these practices the youth should be taught to shun,
as they would shun the leprosy."—Education, page 236.
   5. What other form of falsehood is condemned in the Scrip-
tures? Ps. 12:2; Prov. 26:28.

   NOTE.—"Flattery is also a form of the same sin. To say to another, man
concerning him things which are not believed to be true, which, indeed, are
known to be untrue, simply for the sake of pleasing him, and paying tribute to
his vanity, is to perjure the soul, and may be to imperil his safety."—G.
Campbell Morgan, The Ten Commandments, page 103.
   6. To what methods of speaking and dealing do some resort
for reasons of self-interest? Ps. 34:13; Jer. 9:5.

                                   •
    NOTE.—"Lies of self-interest are uttered in buying and selling goods, cattle,
or any kind of merchandise. Lies of vanity are uttered by men who love to
appear what they are not. A story cannot pass through their hands without
embellishment. Oh, how much is done in the world which the doers will one
day wish to undo ! But the record of words and deeds in the books of heaven
will tell the sad story of falsehoods spoken and acted."—Testimonies, vol. 4,
p. 335.
    "Falsehood virtually consists in an intention to deceive; and this may be
shown by a look or a word. Even facts may be so arranged and stated as to
constitute falsehoods."—Ibid., vol. 4, p. 335.

                          Lips of the Righteous
   7. How does God regard all falsehood of the lips? Jer. 9:3;
Prov. 12:22.

    NOTE.—"Falsehood and deception of every cast is sin against the God of
truth and verity. The word of God is plain upon these points. . . . God is a
God of sincerity and truth. The word of God is a book of truth. Jesus is a
faithful and true witness. The church is the witness and ground of the truth.
                                    [ 32
All the precepts of the Most High are true, and righteous. altogether. How,
then, must prevarication, and any exaggeration or deception appear in His
sight?"—Testinzonies, vol. 4, p. 336.

   8. How should the keeping of one's word be regarded even
though it appear to be disadvantageous to do so? ,Ps. 15:4, last part.

   NoTE.—"An adherence to the strictest principles of truth will frequently
cause present inconvenience, and may even involve temporal loss; but it will
increase the reward in theure
                          ut     life."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 337.

9. How will the children of God not employ their tongues?
What will they hate? Isa. 63:8; Ps. 119:163.

   NOTE.—"Everything that Christians do should be as transparent as the
sunlight. Truth is of God; deception, in every one of its myriad forms, is of.
Satan; and whoever in any way departs from the straight line of truth is
betraying himself into the power of the wicked one."—Thoughts From the
Mount of Blessing, pages 105, 106.

   10. Can unaided man hope to keep his tongue in the ways of
truth? What help, therefore, should we ask of the Lord? James.
3:7, 8; Ps. 141:3.

   NOTE.—"You have a work to do to control the tongue. It is a little member
and boasteth great things, but it needs the bridle of grace and the bit of self-
control to keep it from running at random."—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 316.

  11. What ultimately determines the character of our speech?
Matt. 12:34, 35; Ps. 51:6.

    NoTE.—"When the mind is pure and the thoughts ennobled by the truth of
Ged, the words will be of the same character, 'like apples of gold in baskets of
silver.' "—Counsels to Teachers, page 443.                                       •
    "We cannot speak the truth unless our minds are continually guided by Him
who is truth."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, page 106. ,

                       Deceivers of the Last Days
    12. What forms of falsehood will be particularly manifest in
 the last days? 2 Tim. 3:3, 13; 1 Tim. 4:1, 2.

 days? Rev. 14:5; Zeph. 3:13.

    14. What language may well be the prayer of the soul? Ps.
19:14.

                    Lesson 12, for March 19, 1949
                         Holy Contentment
   MEMORY VERSE: "And He said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covet-
ousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he
possesseth." Luke 12:15.
   STUDY HELPS: Taylor G. Bunch, "The Ten Commandments," pages 162-173;
"Christ's Object Lessons," pages 252-259 (new ed., pages 253-259).

                        How Covetousness Began
  1. How comprehensive is the command against covetousness?
Ex. 20:17. See also Romans 13:9.

   NOTE.—"The tenth commandment strikes at the very root of all sins, pro-
hibiting the selfish desire, from which springs the sinful act. He who in obedi-
ence to God's law refrains from indulging even a sinful desire for that which
belongs to another, will not be guilty of an act of wrong toward his fellow
creatures."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 309.
   2. Where and when did covetousness first arise? In what
circumstances did it take root in the human heart? Isa. 14:12-14;
Gen. 3:6.
    NOTE.—"Instead of seeking to make God supreme in the affections and
allegiance of His creatures, it was Lucifer's endeavor to win their service and
homage to himself. And coveting the honor which the infinite Father had
bestowed upon His Son, this prince of angels aspired to power which it was the
                       ne to wield."—The Great Controversy, page 494.
prerogative of Christ alo
  3. With what other sins is covetousness associated? Jer. 6:13;
Acts 5:1-5; James 4:1-3.
   NoTE.—"It was covetousness that Ananias and Sapphira had first cherished.
The desire to retain for themselves a part of that which they had promised to
the Lord, led them into fraud and hypocrisy."—The Acts of the Apostles,
page 74.
                              Root of All Evil
   4. What warning did Jesus give concerning treasure? Matt.
6:19-21.
    NOTE.—"We have before us the fearful doom of Achan, of Judas, of Ana-
nias and Sapphira. Back of all these we have that of Lucifer, that 'son of the
morning,' who, coveting a higher state, forfeited forever the brightness and bliss
of heaven. And yet, notwithstanding all these warnings, covetousness abounds."
—Patriarchs and Prophets, pages 496, 497.
                        Covetousness Is Idolatry
   5. What, therefore, does Paul declare covetousness to be? Col.
3:5, last part.
                                      [ 34 3
    NOTE.—"The word of God defines covetousness as idolatry. It is impossible
for men and women to keep the law of God and love money. The heart's
affections should be placed upon heavenly things. Our treasure should be kid
up in heaven; for where our treasure is, there will our heart be also."—Testi-
monies, vol. 3; p. 130.
   6. How does God, therefore, regard the covetous? Ps. 10:3.

                      True Estimate of Possessions
   7. What counsel did Jesus give concerning life and material
things? Matt. 16:24-26.
    NOTE.—"The Saviour saw that men were absorbed in getting gain and
were losing sight of eternal realities. He undertook to correct this evil.   ' He
sought to break the infatuating spell that was paralyzing the soul. Lifting up
His voice He cried, 'What is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world,
and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?'
Matt. 16:26. He presents before fallen humanity the nobler world they have
lost sight of, that they may behold eternal realities. He takes them to the
threshold of the Infinite, flushed with the indescribable glory of God, and shows
them the treasure there. The value of this treasure is above gold or silver. The
riches of earth's mines cannot compare with it."—Christ's Object Lessons, pages
106, 107.
  8. How does Paul admonish believers? How should we ask
God to guide our desires? Col. 3:5; Ps. 119:36.

    NoTE.—"In proportion as the love of Christ fills our hearts and controls our
lives, covetousness, selfishness, and love of ease will be overcome, and it will
be our pleasure to do the Will of Christ, whose servants we claim to be."—Testi-
monies, vol. 3, p. 382.
   9. With what should we be content, and why? Heb..13:5.

    NorE.—"Open your hearts to receive this kingdom, and make its service
your highest interest. Though it is a spiritual kingdom, fear not that your needs
for this life will be uncared for. If you give yourself to God's service, He who
has all power in heaven and earth will provide for your needs."—Thoughts
From the Mount of Blessing, page 147.
                   Divine Remedy for Covetousness
  10. What provision has God made to check covetousness in His
people? Mal. 3:10.

    NOTE.—"Constant, self-denying benevolence is God's remedy for the can-
kering sins of selfishness and covetousness. God has arranged systematic
benevolence to sustain His cause and relieve the necessities of the suffering and
needy. He has ordained that giving should become a habit, that it may coun-
teract the dangerous and deceitful sin of covetousness. Continual giving
starves covetousness to death. Systematic benevolence is designed in the order
                                       35
of God to tear away treasures from the covetous as fast as they are gained,
and to consecrate them to the Lord, to whom they belong."—Testimonies,
vol. 3, p. 548.
   11. From what will the covetous be forever excluded? 1 Cor.
6:9, 10.
    NOTE.—"In the day of final judgment men's hoarded wealth will be worth-
less to them. They have nothing they can call their own."—Christ's Object
Lessons, page 372.

                     Lesson 13, for March 260949

                        The Supreme Motive
   MEMORY VERSE: "Whoso keepeth His word, in him verily is the love of God
perfected: hereby know we that we are in Him." 1 John 2:5.
   LESSON HELPS: Taylor G. Bunch, "The Ten Commandments," pages 174-190;
"The Acts of the Apostles," pages 539, 567; "Christ's Object Lessons," pages 376-389
(new ed., pages 381-395).

                       Love, the Way of Obedience
   1. How does Jesus summarize the law and explain the secret
of conformity to its requirements? Mark 12:28-34.

    NOTE.—"The scribe was near to the kingdom of God, in that he recognized
deeds of righteousness as more acceptable to God than burnt offerings and
sacrifices. But he needed' to recognize the divine character of Christ, and
through faith in Him receive power to do the works of righteousness. The
ritual service was of no value, unless connected with Christ by living faith.
Even the moral law fails of its purpose, unless it is understood in its relation to
the Saviour. Christ had repeatedly shown that His Father's law contained
something deeper than mere authoritative commands. In the law is embodied
the same principle that is revealed in the gospel. The law points out man's duty
and shows him his guilt. To Christ he must look for pardon and for power to do
what the law enjoins."—The Desire of Ages, page 608.
    "God's law is fulfilled only as men love Him with heart, mind, soul, and
strength, and their neighbor as themselves. It is the manifestation of this love
that brings glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace and good will to
men."—Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 139.
   2. What ancient command did Jesus amplify when He desig-
nated love as the way of obedience? Deut. 6:4, 5; 2 John 5, 6.

    NoTE.—"He who proclaimed the law from Sinai, and delivered to Moses
the precepts of the ritual law, is the same that spoke the Sermon on the Mount.
The great principles of love to God, which He set forth as the foundation of
the law and the prophets, are only a reiteration of what He had spoken through
Moses to the Hebrew people. . . . The Teacher is the same in both dispensa-
tions. God's claims are the same. The principles of His government are the
                                        [36 ]
same. For all proceed from Him 'with whom is no variableness, neither shadow
of turning."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 373.
   3. In what way, then, was Christ's commandment new? John
13:34; 15:9, 10.

   NOTE.—"He saw that new ideas and impulses must control them; that new
principles must be practiced by them; through His life and death they were to
receive a new conception of love. The command to love one another had a new
meaning in the light of His self-sacrifice. The whole work of grace is one
continual service of love, of self-denying, self-sacrificing effort. During every
hour of Christ's sojourn upon the earth, the love of God was flowing from
Him in irrepressible streams. All who are imbued with His spirit will love as
He loved. The very principle that actuated Christ will actuate them in all
their dealing one with another."—The Desire of Ages, pages 677, 678.
                       Love Implanted in the Lif e
    4. From whence does love, the fulfiller of the law, come? How
is it communicated to men? 1 John 4:7, 8, 16; Rom. 5:5.

   Non.—"This love is heaven-born."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 520.
   "If we surrender the will to God, we shall not work in order to earn God's
love. His love as a free gift will be received into the soul, and from love to
Him we shall delight to obey His commandments."—Christ's Object Lessons,
page 283.
   5. In what ways are the three Persons of the Godhead associ-
ated in the impartation of the power of love? 1 John 4:10, 19;
John 17:26; Gal. 5:22, first part.

     NOTE.—"In the new birth the heart is brought into harmony with God, as
it is brought into accord with His law. When this mighty change has taken
place in the sinner, he has passed from death unto life, from sin unto holiness,
from transgression and rebellion to obedience and loyalty. The old life of
alienation from God has ended; the new life of reconciliation, of faith and love,
has begun."—The Great Controversy, page 468.
     "The love of Christ with its redeeming power has come into the heart. This
love masters every other motive, and raises its possessor above the corrupting
influence of the world."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 101.
     "It is the work of the Holy Spirit from age to age to impart love to human
hearts; for love is the living principle of brotherhood."—Testimonies, vol. 8,
p. 139.
   6. How will love implanted in the life inevitably manifest
itself? John 14:15, 23; 2 John 6.

    NOTE.—"John did not teach that salvation was to be earned by obedience;
but that obedience was the fruit of faith and love.. . . If we abide in Christ, if
the love of God dwells in the heart, our feelings, our thoughts, our actions, will
                                      [ 37 ]
be in harmony with the will of God. The sanctified heart is in harmony with
the precepts of God's law."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 563.
   7. In the light of the principle of love how serious is the break-
ing of one commandment? James 2:10.

    NorE.—"Since all the commandments are summed up in love to God and
man, it follows that not one precept can be broken without violating this
principle. Thus Christ taught His hearers that the law of God is not so many
separate precepts, some of which are of great importance, while others are of
small importance, and may with impunity be ignored. Our Lord presents the
first four and the last six commandments as a divine whole, and teaches that
love to God will be shown by obedience to all His commandments."—The
Desire of Ages, page 607.
    "God's law is one living word, man's duty is the response of one central
feeling. . . . Is it not that each sin which the law condemns is a violation of
that spirit which the law demands? Love violated, the whole moral life is
violated."—W. Senior, God's Ten Words, pages 352, 354.
                        Love and Our Neighbor

   8. If we love and obey God, whom else also will we love and
serve? 1 John 4:21; 5:1; John 15:17.

   NOTE.—"If we love God because He first loved us, we shall love all for
whom Christ died. We cannot come in touch with divinity without coming in
touch with humanity; for in Him who sits upon the throne of the universe,
divinity and humanity are combined. Connected with Christ, we are con-
nected with our fellow men by the golden links of the chain of love."—Christ's
Object Lessons, pages 384, 385.
   9. Who is our neighbor? Luke 10:29-37.

    NOTE.—"Christ has shown that our neighbor does not mean merely one of
the church or faith to which we belong. It has no reference to race, color, or
class distinction. Our neighbor is every person who needs our help. Our neigh-
bor is every soul who is wounded and bruised by the adversary. Our neighbor
is everyone who is the property of God."—The Desire of Ages, page 503.

   10. How will love for our neighbor express itself? What will
be the measure of our love? 1 John 3:18; John 15:12; 1 John 3:16.

    NOTE.—" 'Let us not love in word,' the apostle writes, 'but in deed and in
truth.' The completeness of Christian character is attained, when the impulse
to help and bless others springs constantly from within. It is the atmosphere
of this love surrounding the soul of the believer that makes him a savor of life
unto life, and enables God to bless his work."—The Acts of the Apostles,
page 551.
    "The law of love calls for the devotion of body, mind, and soul to the

   "The heart in which love rules, will not be filled with passion or revenge, by
injuries which pride and self-love would deem unbearable. Love is unsuspect-
ing, ever placing the most favorable construction upon the motives and acts of
others. Love will never needlessly expose the faults of others. It does not listen
eagerly to unfavorable reports, but rather seeks to bring to mind some good
qualities of the one defamed."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 169.
   11. Of what is love to others thus an evidence? John 13:35;
1 John 2:10; 4:12.

   NOTE.—"This love is the evidence of their discipleship. . . . When men
are bound together, not by force or self-interest, but by love, they show the
working of an influence that is above every human influence. Where this
oneness exists, it is evidence that the image of God is being .restored in hu-
manity, that a new principle of life has been implanted."—The Desire of Ages,
page 678.
  12. In what one word does Paul summarize the last six com-
mandments? How does James define the royal law respecting
our neighbor? Gal. 5:14; James 2:8.

   NOTE.—"The first four of the Ten Commandments are summed up in the
one great precept, 'Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart.' The
fast six are included in the other, 'Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.'
Both these commandments are an expression of the principle of love."—The
Desire of Ages, page 607.
                     Rewards of Loving Obedience
  13. What will be the reward here and hereafter of loving
obedience? Ex. 20:6; Deut. 7:9; 30:16.

       THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
                   March 26, 1949 —Far Eastern Division
    In this far-flung Far Eastern Division with approximately 235,000,000
population we have 40,000 baptized members. A new interest in the things of
God has sprung up in this field, and a special effort is being made to take
advantage of this opportunity to hasten the gospel message. The doors are
wide open, and we must enter. For many years some of the Pacific islands have
waited for the gospel. This field needs everything—workers, chapels, schools,
medical institutions, and homes for workers.
    The two projects, however, to which the overflow of the Thirteenth Sab-
bath Offering is dedicated are the establishing of headquarters on Guam for the
newly organized Far Eastern Island Mission, comprising the Marianas, Palau,
Caroline, and the Marshall Islands, and the opening of medical work in Hiro-
shima, Japan. The latest overflow offering given to this field the fourth quarter
of 1946 was $36,162.54. Will you not give generously of your means to these
two projects that we may roll up an even larger overflow on March 26?
