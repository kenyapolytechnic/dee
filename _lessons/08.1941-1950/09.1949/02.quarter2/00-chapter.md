THE MESSAGES OF DANIEL THE PROPHET
                           Introductory Note
    In the remarkable book of Daniel the statement is four times repeated
that its prophecies are a special revelation for "the latter days," or "time of
the end." Dan. 2:28; 8:17, 19; 10:14; 12:4.
    "The light that Daniel received from God was given especially for these
last days. The visions he saw by the banks of the Mai and the Hiddekel, the
great rivers of Shinar, are now in process of fulfillment, and all the events
foretold will soon come to pass. . . .
    "When the books of Daniel and Revelation are better understood, believers
will have an entirely different religious experience. They will be given such
glimpses of the open gates of heaven that heart and mind will be impressed
with the character that all must develop in order to realize the blessedness
which is to be the reward of the pure in heart. . .
   "Let Daniel speak, let the Revelation speak, and tell what is truth."—
Testimonies to Ministers, pages 113-118.



                         Lesson 1, for April 2, 1949

                      Ambassadors to Babylon
    LESSON SCRIPTURE: Dan. 1:1-20.
    MEMORY VERSE: "Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile him-
self with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore
he requested of the prince of the , eunuchs that he might not defile himself." Dan. 1:8.
    STUDY HELPS: "Daniel and the Revelation" (1944 edition), pages 15-27;
"Prophets and Kings." pages 452-490.
    AIM: To see God's exalted purpose for Israel as a light bearer to the world, and
their tragic failure and retribution, and the men of conquering faith whom God raised
up to meet the crisis.

                  Israel's Unprecedented Opportunity

   1. What was the divine purpose in the call of Abraham? Why
did God impart to him and his posterity a special blessing? Gen.
12:1-3; 22:18; Gal. 3:8.

    NOTE.—"God intended that His people Israel should be light bearers to all
the inhabitants of the earth. . . . He might have made angels the ambas-
sadors of His truth; He might have made known His will, as He proclaimed
the law from Sinai, with His own voice; but in His infinite love and wisdom
He called men to become colaborers with Himself, by choosing them to do
this work."—Patriarchs and. Prophets, page 528.
                                     [3]
  2. Among the nations of earth what position was Israel to oc-
cupy? Deut. 28:1, 13.

   3. For the accomplishment of this purpose, what country was
assigned to them as a homeland? Gen. 17:8. Compare Isaiah 19:
23-25.
    NoTE.—Israel's strategic location on the international highway between
three continents was not by mere chance. The chosen people were to serve as
a lighthouse for God; and as royal retinues and endless caravans of trade
would pass to and fro over this great "land bridge" between the centers of
ancient civilization, a knowledge of Jehovah was to be carried to all nations.

                 The Signal Failure and Retribution
  4. In, the centuries following the prosperous reigns of David
and Solomon, what tendencies and influences prevailed? Jer. 8:5;
Hosea 11:8.

   NoTE.—Of the nineteen monarchs who subsequently reigned over the re-
volted ten tribes of Israel, all were idolatrous; while of the nineteen kings arid
one queen who ruled in Judah, more than half were corrupt and ignoble in
character.
   5. In what way did Hezekiah commit a tragic error? As a con-
sequence, what dire message of retribution was delivered to the
king? Isa. 39:1-7.

    NcrrE.—In this experience Hezekiah was granted a providential oppor-
tunity to reveal to the ambassadors from Babylon the unsearchable riches of
heaven; instead he acted as a vainglorious monarch by showing the material
riches of his kingdom.
   6. What scathing denunciation was pronounced upon the last
of Judah's kings, Zedekiah? Ezek. 21:25-27.

   7. In what manner had Judah responded to the prophetic mes-
sages of rebuke? 2 Chron. 36:14-16.

   8. When at length apostasy had become so complete and uni-
versal that no remedy could avail, what doom fell upon Judah and
Jerusalem? Dan. 1:1, 2; 2 Chron. 36:17-20.

    NoTE.—The city of Jerusalem was besieged three times and captured by
Nebuchadnezzar: (1) When Daniel and his companions were carried to Baby-
lon in the Jewish year 606-605 ri.c.; (2) following the revolt of Jehoiachin
in 597 E.c.; and (3) at the close of Zedekiah's reign, when the city and temple
were utterly destroyed in 586 B.C.

                 Witnessing at the Court of Babylon
   9. Outline the liberal provisions made by the king for the youth-
ful captives of royal blood. Dan. 1:3-5.

   10. What motive prompted the change of names? Dan. 1:6, 7.

    NoTE.—"By giving them names significant of idolatry, by bringing them
daily into close association with idolatrous customs, and under the influence
of the seductive rites of heathen worship, he [Nebuchadnezzar] hoped to
induce them to renounce the religion of their nation, and to unite with the
worship of the Babylonians."—Prophets and Kings, page 481.
  11. What loyal, courageous resolve filled the heart of Daniel?
Dan. 1:8.
    NoTE.—Israel had been unfaithful as a light bearer to the nations. Now
in the garb of captives, God commissioned His chosen ambassadors to Baby-
lon. "In the land of their captivity these men were to carry out God's purpose
by giving to heathen nations the blessings that come through a knowledge of
Jehovah. They were to be His representatives."—Prophets and Kings, page
479. At the time of his exile, Daniel was but eighteen years of age. See Testi-
monies, vol. 4, p. 570.
  12. Relate the dining-hall experiences of Daniel and his com-
panions. Dan. 1:9-16.

    NOTE.—"What if Daniel and his companions had made a compromise with
those heathen officers, and had yielded to the pressure of the occasion, by eat-
ing and drinking as was customary with the Babylonians? That single in-
stance of departure from principle would have weakened their sense of right
and their abhorrence of wrong. Indulgence of appetite would have involved
the sacrifice of physical vigor, clearness of intellect, and spiritual power. One
wrong step would probably have led to others, until, their connection with
heaven being severed, they would have been swept away by temptation."—
Ellen G. White, The Sanctified Life, page 19.
  13. What were the attainments of the Judean youth while in the
imperial school of Babylon? Dan. 1:17-20.
                          The Secret of Success
  14. In the life of Daniel what principles of success are divinely
demonstrated? 1 Sam. 2:30, last part; Prov. 22:29.

    NoTE.—Daniel 1:8 is the key text to the book and life of the prophet-
statesman of Babylon. "While Daniel clung to his God with unwavering
trust, the spirit of prophetic power came upon him. While he was instructed
of man in the duties of court life, he was taught of God to read the mysteries
of future ages, and to present to coming generations, through figures and
similitudes, the wonderful things that would come to pass in the last days."
—The Sanctified Life, page 19.

                      Lesson 2, for April 9, 1949
                        A Dream of Empire
   LESSON SCRIPTURE: Dan. 2:1-47.
   MEMORY VERSE: "There is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh
known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days." Dan. 2:28.
   STUDY HELPS: "Daniel and the Revelation," pages 32-82; "Prophets and
Kings," pages 491-502.
  AIM: To look behind the scenes to discover the true philosophy of history. See
"Prophets and Kings," pages 499, 500.

                      Nebuchadnezzar's Dilemma
   1. Relate the circumstances of the forgotten dream, and the
king's efforts to recall it to memory. Dan. 2:1-9.

  2. What confession signalized the utter defeat of the master
minds of paganism? Dan. 2:10, 11.
    NOTE.—Babylon was then the educational center of the world. At its
dazzling court were assembled the most distinguished intellectuals of the realm.
Clever magicians practiced the superstitious rites of the fortuneteller. Keen
astrologers professed to forecast human events by the movements of the stars.
The sorcerers pretended to read the future by communicating with the spirits
of the dead; while the astute and scholarly Chaldeans constituted an influ-
ential group of the imperial counselors.

   3. What ruthless decree was issued, and how did Daniel and '
his friends meet the crisis? Dan. 2:12-18.
                      Prayer Unlocks the Secret
   4. How did God reward the faith of these yoiing men? Dan. 2:
19-23.
   5. On the following day what wonderful truth was announced
to King Nebuchadnezzar? Dan. 2:27, 28.
    NoTE.—Like the modernists of today, Babylon's wise men expressed belief
in an absentee god, or "gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh." In striking
contrast observe the vibrant testimony of Daniel: "There is a God in heaven
that revealeth secrets."
   6. What was the dream? Dan. 2:31-35. (Each pupil is advised
to commit these verses to memory.)
                          Four World Empires
   7. What was the golden head of the image declared to symbol-
ize? Dan. 2:36-38.
                                     [6]
    NOTE.—In the language of Scripture, Babylon bears the radiant title of
"the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency." Isa. 13:19.
Its capital was also called "the golden city." Isa. 14:4.
  8. In what words did Daniel predict the rise of a second world
empire? Dan 2:39, first part. •

    NoTE.—Less than three quarters of a century alter this prophecy was
given, and while Daniel was yet living, the Medo-Persians conquered queenly
Babylon, slew King Belshazzar, and possessed themselves of its treasures and
territory. Under the leadership of such great emperors as Cyrus and Darius,
Persia extended its authority from Ethiopia to India, a territory embracing
one hundred twenty-seven provinces. While greater in extent, Medo-Persia
was "inferior" to Babylon in wealth and grandeur, even as silver is inferior
to gold.
   9. What vast expanse of power was indicated for the "third
kingdom of brass"? Dan. 2:39, last part.

   NoTE.—Alexander the Great, the mightiest conqueror of antiquity, over-
whelmed the Persians in three great battles, the final and decisive engagement
occurring at Arbela in 331 B.C. But the mighty Alexander died at an early age,
and his kingdom soon crumbled.
  10. What graphic language foretold the character of the iron
monarchy of Rome? Dan. 2:40.

    NoTE.—Employing the very terms and symbols of Scripture, the agnostic
historian, Edward Gibbon, describes the Roman conquest: "The arms of the
republic, sometimes vanquished in battle, always victorious in war, advanced
with rapid steps to the Euphrates, the Danube, the Rhine, and the ocean ;
and the images of gold, or silver, or brass, that might serve to represent the
nations and their kings, were successively broken by the iron monarchy of
Rome."—Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, General Obs,ervations, fol-
lowing chapter 38.
   11. What was foreshadowed by the unnatural mixture of the
iron and clay in the feet and toes? Dan. 2:41, 42.

    NoTE.—Between A.D. 351 and 476, Teutonic tribes from Northern Europe
swarmed across the Rhine and Danube, destroyed the Roman Empire, and
laid the foundation for the modern nations of Southern and Western Europe.
              Futile Attempt to Re-establish Empire
   12. What great prophetic utterance declared that the shattered
fragments of empire would defy all attempts to cement them to-
gether? Dan. 2:43.

   NOTE.—Among the most ambitious, determined, and notable aspirants
to universal empire may be mentioned Charlemagne of the eighth century,
Charles V of the sixteenth, Louis XIV of the seventeenth, Napoleon Bona-
                                   [7]
parte of the nineteenth, and Kaiser Wilhelm and Adolf Hitler of the twentieth.
    In spite of all human efforts by war, diplomacy, leagues, treaties, and
intermarriage, Europe still exists as a continent of rival, jealous states. Said
the prophecy: "They shall not cleave one to another," and "the scripture can-
not be broken."
                        The Fifth Kingdom
   13. In the days of these kings, or kingdoms, what world-shatter-
ing event is to take place? Dan. 2:44, 45.

   14. By what astonishing act and statement did Nebuchadnezzar
respond to the heaven-sent message? Dan. 2:46, 47.

                       Lesson 3, for April 16, 1949
                              Tested by.Fire
    LESSON SCRIPTURE: Daniel 3.
    MEMORY VERSE: "Our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burn-
ing fiery furnace, and He will deliver us out of thine hand, 0 king." Dan. 3:17.
    STUDY HELPS: "Prophets and Kings," pages 503-513; "Daniel and the Rev-
elation," pages 71-78.
   AIM: To observe in this lesson a miniature representation of the trials awaiting the
remnant church, and a people who will emerge from the conflict in victory and triumph.

                              The Golden Image
  1. As Nebuchadnezzar reached the pinnacle of human greatness,
what idolatrous project did he devise? Dan. 3:1.

   NoTE.—According to the Oxford Bible, marginal chronology, twenty-three
years had elapsed since the momentous day when Daniel interpreted the king's
dream. In the interval, Jerusalem had been destroyed. King Jehoiachin of
Judah languished in a Babylonian prison; while the chosen people of God
were scattered and disheartened.
   In the meantime the vivid impressions of that former occasion faded from
Nebuchadnezzar's mind. With increasing zeal he resumed his idol worship.
He would construct an image, not like the one in the dream; but "would
excel the original." It "should be entirely of gold,—symbolic throughout of
Babylon as an eternal, indestructible, all-powerful kingdom, which should
break in pieces all other kingdoms, and stand forever."—Prophets and Kings,
page 504.
   2. Who were summoned to attend the elaborate ceremonies of
dedication? Dan. 3:2, 3.

  3. What decree was issued? What was the punishment for non-
conformity? Dan. 3:4-7.
                                        [8]
                             Heroes of Faith
   4. What accusation was brought'to the king? Dan. 3:8-12.

  5. When the three men were brought before the king, what
question did he ask? Dan. 3:13, 14.

   6. What extreme leniency did Nebuchadnezzar reveal? Dan.
3:15.
   NOTE.—How remarkable that the pagan ruler of a totalitarian empire
should have suggested for these men another trial, a second chance ! In spite
of his anger, "he was convinced that they possessed something the other wise
men of his kingdom did not have" ( Prophets and Kings, page 507) ; yet he
reminded them of a fiery furnace awaiting traitors and rebels; and concluded
his appeal with the challenge to Jehovah, "who is that God that shall deliver
you out of my hands?"
   7. With what resolute statements did the accused men reject
the king's proposal? Dan. 3:16-18.
   NorE.—The religion of the Bible admits of no compromise; and every
loyal Christian senses his duty to stand for the right, leaving the consequences
with God. The phrase, "Our God whom we serve," expresses the guiding
principle in the lives of these Hebrews. They did not argue. They were not
philosophers, but simply believers, and were willing to die rather than commit
a known sin.
                          In the Fiery Furnace
  8. In his ungoverned fury, what command did the king issue?
Dan. 3:19-21.

   9. As the sentence was being executed, how did God begin to
vindicate the right? Dan. 3:22, 23.

   10. Looking toward the furnace, what did the astonished king
do and say? Dan. 3:24, 25.

    NoTE.—"The Lord did not forget His own. As His witnesses were cast
into the furnace, the Saviour revealed Himself to them in person, and together
they walked in the midst of the fire. In the presence of the Lord of heat and
cold, the flames lost their power to consume."—Prophets and Kings, pages
508, 509. In later times thousands have walked calmly to the stake, cheered
and inspired by the dauntless courage of these truehearted exiles.
                         The Great Deliverance
   11. When the Hebrews were called from the furnace by Nebu-
chadnezzar, in what physical condition were they found? Dan. 3:
26, 27.
                                      [9]
    NoTE.—Pagan priests of many lands have often boasted of their ability
to walk unharmed over burning coals; but in this miracle, the death of the
executioners emphasized the supreme protection extended to these servants
of the Most High. Instead of injury, the flames freed them from their bonds
and enabled them to walk unscathed amid the flames' The furnace fire tested
and revealed the gold of character. Compare 1 Corinthians 3:12, 13.
    12. In his decree of recognition of the God of heaven, how did
the king again violate the principles of true religious liberty? Dan.
3:28, 29.

   NoTE.—"Nebuchadnezzar was exceeding his right as a temporal sovereign.
He had no more right, either civil or moral, to threaten men with death for not
worshiping God, than he had to make the decree consigning to the flames all
who refused to worship the golden image. God never compels the obedience of
man. He leaves all free to choose whom they will serve."—Prophets and
Kings, page 511.
                            Lessons for Today
    13. Amid the final struggles of earth, to what extent will the
rights of conscience be violated? Rev. 13:15-17.

  NoTE.—Twenty-five centuries ago the crisis centered about the image on
the plain of Dura ; while in the coming crisis the conflict will involve another
image—the image of the beast.
   "In this our day, many of God's servants, though innocent of wrongdo-
ing, will be given over to suffer humiliatiOn and abuse at the hands of those
who, inspired by Satan, are filled with envy and religious bigotry. Especially
will the wrath of man be aroused against those who hallow the Sabbath of
the fourth commandment; and at last a universal decree will denounce these
as deserving of death."—Prophets and Kings, page 512.
    14. In that hour of trial what divine promises will comfort and
sustain? Ps. 46:1; 91:1-4.

    NOTE.—"He who walked with the Hebrew worthies in the fiery furnace
will be with His followers wherever they are. . . . In the midst of the time
of trouble,—trouble such as has not been since there was a nation,—His
chosen ones will stand unmoved. Satan with all the hosts of evil cannot
destroy the weakest of God's saints. Angels that excel in strength will protect
them, and in their behalf Jehovah will reveal Himself as a 'God of gods,' able
to save to the uttermost those who have put their trust in Him."—Prophets
and Kings, page 513.

                      The Most High Ruleth
    LESSON SCRIPTURE: Daniel 4.
    MEMORY VERSE: "This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the de-
mand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that the
Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever He will."
Dan. 4:17.
    STUDY HELPS: "Prophets and Kings," pages 514-521; "Daniel and the Rev-
elation," pages 79-87.
    AIM: This narrative reveals the wonderful love of Christ in dealing with a proud
human heart. Also how He taught the sublime truth that the Most High ruleth in the
lives of individuals and nations.

                           A Royal Proclamation
  1. To whom did King Nebuchadnezzar dispatch this imperial
message? Why was it issued? Dan. 4:1-5.

    NOTE.—This wonderful chapter of the Bible, with its freshness and vital-
ity, is a public document which was evidently copied from the state papers of
Babylon. How altogether remarkable that it should have been translated and
published in all the languages of the empire, then preserved and incorporated
by Daniel into his book. In fact, a large portion of this book, including the
section from chapter 2, verse 4, to chapter 7, verse 28, was originally written
in Aramaic.

             The Majestic Tree and the Holy Watcher
    2. Relate the dream that was given the king. Dan. 4:10-16.

    3. In the language of the holy watcher, what was the purpose
of this dream? Dan. 4:17.

   4. From whom did the king request an interpretation of the
dream, and with what results? Dan. 4:6, 7.

    Nors.—On a former occasion, the wise men of Babylon boasted that with
a knowledge of the dream they could readily give its interpretation. At this
time, though fully informed of the dream in all its details, they admit utter
failure.
   5. How did Daniel reveal his deep emotions concerning the
tragic import of the message? Dan. 4:18, 19.

                      The Decree of the Most Higb
  6. Reassured by the king, how did Daniel explain the symbolic
message of the stately tree? Dan. 4:20-23.
                               [ lii
   7. What threatened retribution was about to fall upon the
proud Nebuchadnezzar? How long was it to continue? Dan. 4:
24, 25.
   NoTE.—The term "seven times" as here used denotes "seven years," and it
is so rendered by Moffatt, and in the American Translation by Smith and
Goodspeed. See also Antiquities of the Jews, book 10, chapter 10, section 6.
   8. What feature of the prophecy assured Nebuchadnezzar his
throne would be preserved for him? Dan. 4:15, 26.

   9. What wholesome and salutary appeal did Daniel address to
the king? Dan. 4:27.
    NoTE.—Inspiration termed Babylon "the terrible of the nations," "the
hammer of the whole earth." Ezek. 28:7; Jer. 50:23. Exorbitant taxes were
levied against subjugated peoples. In the vast public works program, forced
labor and cruel servitude were imposed upon defenseless subjects. By such
arbitrary exactions hundreds of thousands were enslaved that the king of
Babylon might revel in wealth and luxury.
    In the appeal to "break off thy sins by righteousness," and to show "mercy
to the poor," Daniel's loyalty to his king, combined with fidelity to truth and
justice, elicits our highest admiration.
    "For a time the impression of the warning and the counsel of the prophet
was strong upon Nebuchadnezzar; but the heart that is not transformed by
the grace of God soon loses the impressions of the Holy Spirit. . . . For
months the judgment of God lingered. But instead of being led to repentance
by this forbearance, the king indulged his pride until he lost confidence in
the interpretation of the dream, and jested at his former fears."—Prophets
and Kings, page 519.
     10. What characteristic remark of Nebuchadnezzar precipitated
his mental collapse? Dan. 4:28-30.
    NoTE.—Archaeologists testify that Nebuchadnezzar was one of the great-
est builders of all history. At least nine tenths of the bricks dug from the
ruins of old Babylon bear the name and title of this monarch.
  11. While words of pride were on the king's lips, what divine
mandate was announced? State the result. Dan. 4:31-33.

    NoTE.—Nothing can be more tragic than a human life fashioned for God,
yet degraded and groveling in the dust. How unspeakably sad when those who
might be witnesses for Christ are satisfied with passing pleasures and worldly
gain ! Or, as expressed by another, that—
         "We who are heirs of a kingship divine,
          Are content with the huts and the husks of the swine."
                    The Notable Transformation
    12. At the close of the seven-year period, what occurred in the
life of Nebuchadnezzar? What extraordinary confession did he
make? Dan. 4:34, 36.
                                     [ 121
    NoTE.—"For seven years Nebuchadnezzar was an astonishment to all his
subjects; for seven years he was humbled before all the world."—Prophets
and Kings, page 520.
    Herein is revealed a wondrous providence. When God cannot save men
in prosperity, He oftimes sends adversity. In the lives of many, chastisement
frequently "yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are
exercised thereby." Heb. 12:11.
   13. Repeat the closing sentence of Nebuchadnezzar's remark-
able proclamation. Dan. 4:37.

    NOTE.—"The once proud monarch had become a humble child of God;
the tyrannical, overbearing ruler, a wise and compassionate king. He who
had defied and blasphemed the God of heaven, now acknowledged the power
of the Most High, and earnestly sought to promote the fear of Jehovah and
the happiness of his subjects. Under the rebuke of Him who is King of kings
and Lord of lords, Nebuchadnezzar had learned at last the lesson which all
rulers need to learn,—that true greatness consists in true goodness."—Prophets
and Kings, page 521.


                       Lesson 5, for April 30, 1949

                The Randwriting on the Wall
    LESSON SCRIPTURE: Daniel 5.
    MEMORY VERSE: "My heart panted, fearfulness affrighted me: the night of
my pleasure hath He turned into fear unto me." Isa. 21:4.
    STUDY HELPS: "Daniel and the Revelation," pages 89-95; "Prophets and
Kings," pages 522-538.
    AIM: To reveal the sure penalty resulting from deeds of sacrifice and desecration;
also to inspire confidence in the great fact that "the complicated play of human events
is under divine control."—"Prophets and Kings," page 536.

                           Babylon's Last Banquet

   1. Describe the feast of Belshazzar. Dan. 5:1.

    NOTE. "For centuries the infidel historian pointed to Belshazzar as a
nonexistent creature of fancy, but today he is known to have been a very
real and actual sovereign. His name appears on commercial contracts and
state documents, some of which ascribe to him royal powers and dual ruler-
ship with his father Nabonidus. On a prayer tablet of the latter are these
words: 'As for Belshazzar my first-born son, . . . place in his heart fear of
thy great divinity; let him not turn to sinning; let him be satisfied with full-
ness of life.' Evidently the old king was definitely worried over his wayward
son."—Roy Franklin Cottrell, The Spade and the Book, page 19.
  2. In his intoxicated delirium what command did the king issue?
Dan. 5:2-4.
                                         [13 ]
   NoTE.—Unholy hands were laid upon holy things. "Little did Belshazzar
think that there was a heavenly Witness to his idolatrous revelry; that a
divine Watcher, unrecognized, looked upon the scene of profanation, heard
the sacrilegious mirth, beheld the idolatry. But soon the uninvited Guest
made His presence felt."—Prophets and Kings, page 524.
      "The Bloodless Hand From the Sleeve of Darkness"
   3. As the revelry was at its height, what strange occurrence
alarmed the banqueters? Dan. 5:5.

    NoTE.—Archaeologists announce that they have unquestionably discovered
the royal banquet hall of the old Babylonian palace. Its foundations are
56x168 feet; and the excavators feel no little thrill as they recall the glamor-
ous scenes there enacted, and the fateful words, gleaming like fire, that were
traced upon the palace wall. See James C. Muir, His Truth Endureth, page 222.
  4. How did the spectacle affect the young king and his guests?
Dan. 5:6.

   NOTE.—"Hushed was the boisterous mirth, while men and women, seized
with nameless terror, watched the hand slowly tracing the mysterious char-
acters. Before them passed, as in panoramic view, the deeds of their evil
lives; they seemed to be arraigned before the judgment bar of the eternal
God, whose power they had just defied. Where but a few moments before
had been hilarity and blasphemous witticism, were pallid faces and cries of
fear. When God makes men fear, they cannot hide the intensity of their terror.
Belshazzar was the most terrified of them all."—Prophets and Kings, page 524.
   5. What frantic appeal was made to the statesmen and trusted
advisers of the realm? With what results? Dan. 5:7, 8, 15. Com-
pare Isa. 47:13.

    NOTE.—This was the third great challenge to the wise men of Babylon.
For the third time they go down to ignominious defeat, and for the third
time a monarch of that mighty empire appeals in an emergency to a servant
of Jehovah.
                     The Man for the Crisis Hour
  6. In that moment of supreme emergency what did the queen
mother suggest? Dan. 5:10-12.

   7. Relate the king's statement to Daniel. Dan. 5:13-16.

   8. In the prophet's reply, how did he regard the promised re-
ward? What did he declare that God had done for Nebuchadnez-
zar? Dan. 5:17-19.

   NOTE.—"Before that terror-stricken throng, Daniel, unmoved by the
promises of the king, stood in the quiet dignity of a servant of the Most
                                  114]
High, not to speak words of flattery, but to interpret a message of doom."—
Prophets and Kings, page 529.
   9. With what experience of Nebuchadnezzar was the young
king fully acquainted? How had he failed to be benefited by this
knowledge? Dan. 5:20-23.

                The Sentence of the Unseen Watcher
  10. Name the four strange characters inscribed on the palace
wall, and give their interpretation. Dan. 5:24-28.

    NOTE.—"In this inscription each word stands for a short sentence. Mene,
`numbered;' Tekel, 'weighed,' Upharsin, from the root peres, 'divided.' God,
whom thou hast defied, has thy kingdom in His own hands, and has numbered
its days and finished its course just at the time thou thoughtest it at the height
of its prosperity."—The Prophecies of Daniel and the Revelation, page 94.
    The writing upon the wall was in the form of the ancient Hebrew char-
acters, which were already becoming obsolete in the days of Daniel, hence
the inability of the wise men to read the message. See Adam Clarke's Com-
mentary on Daniel 5:24.
   11. What reward did Daniel receive? Dan. 5:29.

    NoTE.—"It is clear that Nabonidus was looked upon as the first ruler of
the nation and that Belshazzar was regarded as the second. The interpreter
of the dream in the fifth chapter of Daniel was given third place in the king-
dom."—Raymond P. Dougherty, Nabonidus and Belshazzar, page 197.
   12. Before the night was ended, what world-shaking event oc-
curred? Dan. 5:30, 31; Jer. 50:46.

   NOTE.—An ancient clay tablet bears this inscription: "In the month Tam-
muz (June-July) Cyrus . . . conquered the inhabitants of Akkad. . . . On
the 16th Gobryas, governor of the land of Gutium, and the soldiers of Cyrus
entered Babylon without a battle. . . . On the 3d day of Marcheswan (Oct.-
Nov.) Cyrus entered Babylon. . . . Cyrus proclaimed peace to all of Baby-
lon."—George A. Barton, Archaeology and the Bible, 1916 ed., pages 443, 444.
   13. In the conquest of Babylon what remarkable prophecies were
fulfilled? Isa. 44:27, 28; 45:1, 2.

    NoTE.—This divine forecast, penned more than a century before the birth
of Cyrus, called him by name and indicated the strategy by which he would
draw off and "dry up" the waters of the Euphrates. True also to this pre-
diction, in the ,drunken revelry of the feast of Tammuz, the Babylonians
left the river gates unguarded, enabling the stealthy Persians to enter Baby-
lon without a major battle.
                           The Impending Crisis
   14. Of what was the fall of ancient Babylon a type? Rev. 18:1, 2.
                                      [ 15 ]
     NOTE.—In the concluding paragraphs of the chapter in Prophets and
Kings describing the overthrow of old Babylon, occur the following state-
ments, which are of vital import to those who are soon to witness the fall
of modern Babylon:
     "Today the signs of the times declare that we are standing on the thresh-
old of great and solemn events. Everything in our world is in agitation.
. . . The present is a time of overwhelming interest to all living. Rulers
and statesmen, men who occupy positions of trust and authority, thinking
men and women of all classes, have their attention fixed upon the events
taking place about us. They are watching the relations that exist among
the nations. They observe the intensity that is taking possession of every
earthly element, and they recognize that something great and decisive is
about to take place,—that the world is on the verge of a stupendous crisis."
—Pages 536, 537.


                        Lesson 6, for May 7, 1949

            Deliverance From the Den of Lions
    LESSON SCRIPTURE: Daniel 6.
    MEMORY VERSE: "Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he
went into his house; and his windows being opened in his chamber toward Jeru-
salem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before
his God, as he did aforetime." Dan. 6:10.
    STUDY HELPS: "Daniel and the Revelation," pages 97-103; "Prophets and
Kings," pages 539-548.
    AIM: To view a noble life of complete consecration to God, and the working out
of God's purpose in the history of nations.

                   The Man of an Excellent Spirit"
   1. Outline the plan of organization for the Medo-Persian Em-
pire. Dan. 6:1, 2.

    2. What honor was accorded to Daniel? Why was he elevated
to this high office? Dan. 6:3.

   Nora.—Daniel was then eighty-six years of age, and his appointment as
prime minister of the newly organized empire excites both our wonder and
admiration. He not only belonged to an alien race held in bondage, but was
also "the third ruler in the kingdom" that had just been overthrown. How-
ever, his interpretation of the handwriting on the wall predicting victory
for the Medes and Persians may have been a contributing factor in the
selection. The king also recognized his undeviating integrity, his unsur-
passed executive ability, and was doubtless deeply impressed with the
"excellent spirit" possessed by this noble man of God.
                   Conspiracy Against "This Daniel"
  3. Because of Daniel's blameless conduct, what envious feelings
were excited? Dan. 6:4.
                                       [ 16 ]
   NOTE.—"Through the reign of successive monarchs, the downfall of the
nation, and the establishment of another world empire, such were his wisdom
and statesmanship, so perfect his tact, his courtesy, his genuine goodness of
heart, his fidelity to principle, that even his enemies were forced to the
confession that 'they could find none occasion nor fault; forasmuch, as he
was faithful.' "—Prophets and Kings, page 546.
    4. What remarkable commendation were his enemies compelled
to give? Dan. 6:5.

   NOTE.—How heartening it would be if such a eulogy could be truthfully
spoken of every member of God's professed people!
   5. What plot against the life of Daniel was instigated, and by
what subtle methods did the conspirators proceed? Dan. 6:6-8.

   NoTE.—According to the marginal rendering of ' verse 6, the committee
of princes "came tumultuously" into the imperial presence, as though some
urgent issue had arisen. Their first words to the king were a falsehood.
They stated that "all the presidents of the kingdom, the governors," and
other high officials had been consulted. In reality they had been holding
secret meetings, while Daniel, the chief of the presidents, had been kept in
ignorance of their deceitful plans. They appealed to the king's vanity, and
he became the unwitting tool of their evil strategy.
              Daniel's Daily Appointments With God
   6. Knowing that the decree had been signed, how did Daniel
order his life? Dan. 6:10.

    NOTE.—"The prophet's enemies counted on Daniel's firm adherence to
principle for the success of their plan. And they were not mistaken in their
estimate of his character. He quickly read their malignant purpose in fram-
ing the decree, but he did not change his course in a single particular. Why
should he cease to pray now, when he most needed to pray? Rather would
he relinquished life itself, than his hope of help in God."—Prophets and Kings,
pages 540, 541.
    Would we possess the faith and courage of a Daniel? Then close the
earthward doors and open the windows of the soul toward Jerusalem. As
we breathe the heavenly atmosphere, we may live so near to Christ that
neither sudden trial nor, unexpected temptation will defeat or overthrow.
   7. By what changeless principle of right was Daniel guided?

   ANSWER: "In all cases where the king had a right to command, Daniel
would obey; but neither the king nor his decree could make him swerve
from allegiance to the King of kings. Thus the prophet boldly yet quietly
and humbly declared that no earthly power has a right to interpose be-
tween the soul and God."—Prophets and Kings, page 542. Compare Acts
4:19, 20; 5:29.
   8. State the course of action followed by Daniel's enemies. Dan.
6:11-13.
                                     [171
    Nom.—While the crafty spies and accusers were busy with their in-
trigue, the venerable secretary of state pursued his even way. He did not
hide or falter; he did not lower his voice, or close a shutter. "He could do
without food for weeks, but not without prayer for a single day. . . . He
prayed for morning guidance, noontime vigilance, and eventide endurance.
Thrice every day he sent letters of petition upon the wings of a sublime
faith."—Charles G. Bellah, The Hero of Babylon, page 117.
                The Law of the Medes and Persians
    9. When the king realized he could not save Daniel from the
vicious trap, what command did he finally issue? What words of
encouragement did he offer? Dan. 6:14-16.

    NorrE.—Full ciedit should be accorded to Darius for his wholehearted
attempt to save the life of his trusted minister of state.
  10. After sealing the den how did Darius spend the night, and
what did he do in the early morning? Dan. 6:17-20.

                      The Mighty Deliverance
   11. In what words did the aged prophet recount God's protec-
tion? Dan. 6:21-23.
    NOTE.—Daniel was eminently prepared "to fraternize with lions and
fellowship with angels." In striking contrast to the supperless, sleepless
night of Darius, the privilege of association with an angel of God doubtless
made that night one of the most delightful and precious experiences of the
prophet's wonderful life.
   12. How did the king deal with Daniel's accusers? Dan. 6:24.

  13. What imperial decree was issued to all peoples and nations?
Dan. 6:25-27.

    Nom.—This remarkable eulogy of the true and living God sent forth to
all peoples of the Medo-Persian world must have produced a profound
effect. No wonder that a year or more later the emperor Cyrus listened to
Daniel's interpretation of prophecy and issued his famous proclamation for
the rebuilding of Jerusalem!
  14. What is said of Daniel's subsequent service as a statesman?
Dan. 6:28.

    Nom.—"The experience of Daniel as a statesman in the kingdoms of
Babylon and Medo-Persia reveals the truth that a businessman is not neces-
sarily a designing, policy man, but that he may be a man instructed by
God at every step."—Prophets and Kings, page 546.
    "From the story of Daniel's deliverance, we may learn that in seasons
of trial and gloom, God's children should be just what they were when their
prospects were bright with hope and their surroundings all that they could
                                   [ 18 ]
desire. Daniel in the lions' den was the same Daniel who stood before the
king as chief among the ministers of state and as a prophet of the Most
High. A man whose heart is stayed upon God will be the same in the hour
of his greatest trial as he is in prosperity."—Ibid., page 545.

                       Lesson 7, for May 14, 1949
                  Great Empires of Prophecy
     LESSON SCRIPTURE: Dan. 7:1-7, 15-17.
     MEMORY VERSE: "Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are
counted as the small dust of the balance: behold, He taketh up the isles as a very
little thing." Isa. 40:15.
     STUDY HELPS: "Daniel and the Revelation," pages 104-110.
     AIM: Td emphasize the eternal truth that "history is but the unrolled scroll of
prophecy."
                      The Vision of the Four Beasts
   1. At what time was this vision given to Daniel? Dan. 7:1.

   NoTE.—Belshazzar was elevated to the throne as associate ruler with his
father Nabonidus in 552 B.c., which was fourteen years prior to the over-
throw of Babylon.
   2. What did the prophet behold? Dan. 7:2.

    NoTE.—The language of Scripture is to be literally understood except
in those passages where figurative speech is employed. In such cases the
Bible student may consistently expect the Book itself to furnish     key to
the symbols used. "Winds" denote political strife and war (Jer. 25:32, 33) ;
while the "sea" or "water" represents peoples and nations (Rev. 17:15).
   3. What arose from the sea, and how did Daniel regard the
spectacle? Dan. 7:3, 15, 16.

   4. What were the beasts declared to signify? Dan. 7:17.

    NOTE.—Comparing also verses 23 and 24, it is seen that the terms "kings"
and "kingdoms" are used interchangeably. As such emblems as the eagle,
the lion, and the bear are employed to represent modern nations, so the
God of heaven caricatured ancient nations in this prophecy of world history
in advance.
            The Lion Kingdom—Babylon, 626-539 B.C.
    5. Describe the first beast that emerged from the sea. Dan. 7:4,
first part. Compare Jeremiah 4:7; Habakkuk 1:6-8.

   NoTE.—Figures of lions, executed in brilliant enamel, have been dug by
excavators from the ruins of old Babylon, some of which are as perfect and
bright as when they glistened from the city walls twenty-five centuries ago.
                                       119
   6. What change occurred in the lion? What did his altered
form indicate? Dan. 7:4, last part.

   NoTE.—Following the death of Nebuchadnezzar, Babylon no longer pos-
sessed the heart and prowess of a lion; while its weak and luxury-loving
rulers hastened the day of overthrow.

              The Bear—Medo-Persia, 539-331 B.C.
   7. What are the characteristics of the bear? Dan. 7:5.

    NOTE.—What a striking preview of the dual Medo-Persian Empire! At
first the Median power was stronger; then Persia gained the ascendancy,
fulfilling the forecast of the beast that "raised up itself on one side." The
words, "Arise, devour much flesh," describe the insatiable military ambition
of the early Persian monarchs. Says Rawlinson: "Cyrus proceeded with
scarcely a pause on a long career of conquest."
         The Leopard Kingdom—Greece, 331-168 B.C.
   8. Describe the peculiar characteristics of the third beast. Dan.
7:6.

    NOTE.—In three great battles, terminating with the conflict at Arbela,
in 331 B.C., the Greeks swept to victory over the Medo-Persians. The four
wings would indicate exceeding celerity of movement ; and in the words of
the historian Appian:
   "The empire of Alexander was splendid in its magnitude, . . . in success
and rapidity of its conquests, and it wanted little of being boundless and
unexampled."—Appian's History of Rome, translation by Horace White,
vol. 1, p. 15.
  9. Of what development were the four heads of the leopard pro-
phetic?

   ANSWER; The early and untimely death of Alexander was followed by
a short period of war and confusion. Out of this chaos four generals of the
army—Cassander, Lysimachus, Seleucus, and Ptolemy—emerged to victory,
and divided among themselves the vast domains of empire. Although thus
broken, Appian asserts that "even the parts were splendid."

The Wonder Beast—The Roman Empire, 168 B.C. - A.D. 476
  10. In the vivid panorama of nations what did the prophet next
behold? Dan. 7:7.

  11. As this nameless, grim-visaged beast began its ruthless work,
how was Daniel impressed? Dan. 7:19.

   12. How did Rome fulfill these specifications?
                                   [ 20 ]
   ANSWER: The "iron monarchy" subjugated, kingdom after kingdom, and
following the battle of Pydna, 168 B.c., became the undisputed master of
the civilized world. Said Cardinal Manning: "The legions of Rome occupied
the circumference of the world. The military roads which sprang from
Rome traversed all the earth ; the whole world was as it were held in peace
and in tranquillity by the universal presence of this mighty heathen em-
pire."—H. E. Manning, The Temporal Power of the Pope; page 122.
  13. What are the ten horns on this beast declared to symbolize?
Dan. 7:24, first part.

    NoTE.—Semicivilized Teutonic tribes, issuing from Northern and Cen-
tral Europe, poured over the frontiers of the expiring Roman Empire. They
appropriated to themselves its fairest provinces, and developed into the
vigorous nations of Southern and Western Europe. The generally accepted
enumeration is as follows:
    (1) Alamanni—Germans. (2) Franks—French. (3) Anglo-Saxons—
English. (4) Burgundians—Swiss. (5) Visigoths=Spanish. (6) Suevi—
Portuguese. (7) Lombards—Italians. (8) Heruli: (9) Vandals. (10)
Ostrogoths. The last-named three have long since ceased to exist as a people
or nation.
               Conclusion: The Everlasting Kingdom
   14. To what grand and happy consummation does this age-long
prophecy point? Dan. 7:27.

   NorE.—"All the treasures of the universe will be open to the study of
God's children. With unutterable delight we shall enter into the joy and the
wisdom of unfallen beings. We shall share the treasures gained through ages
upon ages spent in contemplation of God's handiwork. And the years of
eternity, as they roll, will continue to bring more glorious revelations."—

                  Church History in Advance
    LESSON SCRIPTURE: Dan. 7:8, 19-28.
    MEMORY VERSE: "I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints,
and prevailed against them; until the Ancient of Days came, and judgment was given
to the saints of the Most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the king-
dom." Dan. 7:21, 22.
    STUDY HELPS: "Daniel and the Revelation," pages 115-147.
    AIM: To expose more fully the strategy of Satan in his supreme attempt to usurp
the authority of the Most High and establish "another God on earth."

                 The Rise of the Little Horn
   1. As Daniel was viewing the horns of the fourth beast, what
strange phenomenon did he observe? Describe the eleventh horn,
its appearance, and its manner of speech. Dan. 7:8.
                                       [ 21 ]
   NoTE.—Astonished and sorely perplexed, Daniel sought to understand
"the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceed-
ing dreadful," and of the little horn "before whom three fell; even of that
horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake very great things, whose look
was more stout than his fellows." Verses 19,20. The other horns represented
ordinary civil states or kingdoms; but this "little horn" was to be of a
wholly different nature—ecclesiastical.
   2. What further activity of the little horn was foreseen? Dan.
7:21.
    NOTE.—These words of Scripture foreshadow a power which would reign
among the kings of earth, and assume the right to control the faith and con-
science of men.
                       Warning and Fulfillment
   3. In what vivid language did the apostle Paul warn of coming
peril to the church? 2 Thess. 2:3, 4, 7.

   4. In the early centuries of our era what ecclesiastical power
arose to fulfill these specifications?
   ANSWER: The papacy. A Roman Catholic writer states:
   "Long years ago, when Rome through the neglect of the Western emper-
ors was left to the mercy of the barbarous hordes, the Romans turned to one
figure for aid and protection, and asked him to rule them; and thtis in this
simple manner, the best title of all to kingly right, commenced the temporal
sovereignty of the popes. And meekly stepping to the throne of Caesar, the
vicar of Christ took up the scepter to which the emperors and kings of
Europe were to bow in reverence through so many ages."—J. C. Conroy
(R. C.), in American Catholic Quarterly Review, April, 1911.
   5. To make way for the growth of the little horn, what became
of three of the original ten? Dan. 7:8.

   6. In what other words was this destruction foretold? Dan.
7:24, last clause.
    NOTE.—In its spectacular rise to supremacy the Church of Rome uprooted
three of the "ten kingdoms." They were Arian in belief, and would not bow
to the decrees of the priest-king on the Tiber. The first to fall were the
Heruli in A.D. 493. Four decades later, and on behalf of the papacy, the dis-
tinguished general Belisarius moved against the heretic kings, "plucking up"
the formidable Vandals of North Africa in A.D. 534, and hurling back the
Ostrogoths from Rome in A.D. 538.
                       Sacrilegious Assumption
  7. In the prophetic forecast what attitude would this power as-
sume toward the Most High? Dan. 7:25, first clause.

   8. How has the papacy exalted itself ,to fulfill this indictment?
                                    [ 22 ]
    ANSWER: The following statements are from authoritative Roman Cath-
olic sources:
    "The Pope is the supreme judge of the law of the land. He is the vice-
gerent of Christ, who is not only a priest forever, but also King of kings and
Lord of lords."—From the Civilta Cattolica quoted in Vatican Council, L.
W. Bacon, page 220.
    "The Pope is crowned with a triple crown, as king of heaven, and earth,
and purgatory."—Ferraris, Prompta Bibliotheca, vol. 6, p. 26.
    These terms are not merely relics of the Dark Ages, for they express the
unchanging claims of the Church of Rome. In an encyclical letter bearing the
date of June 20, 1894, Pope Leo XIII repeated the assertion: "We hold upon
this earth the place of God Almighty."—The Great Encyclical Letters of Leo
XIII, page 304.
                 The Spirit of Religious Intolerance
  9. How was this power to treat the true worshipers of God?
Dan. 7:25, second clause.

                  An Attempt to Alter Divine Law
   10. What would this power essay to do? Dan. 7:25, third clause.

   NoTE.—The "American Translation" (Smith and Goodspeed) reads: "He
shall plan to change the sacred seasons and the law." Although the law of
God is unchangeable, here is a religious organization that would "think," or
determine, to change it.
   11. How has the papacy sought to alter the divine precepts?

    ANSWER: Although the Roman Catholic version of the Bible presents the
law of God as proclaimed from Sinai, in their approved catechisms they have
abridged the commandments so as to omit the prohibition against the worship
of images; while, to retain the original number, the tenth is divided into two.
Also in place of the seventh-day Sabbath, the Roman Church has attempted
to substitute Sunday as the universal day of worship. As an example of papal
assumption, observe the following from an official catechism:
    Ques.—How prove you that the church hath power to command feasts and
holy days?
    "Ans.—By the very act of changing the Sabbath into Sunday, which Prot-
estants allow of."—Henry Tuberville, An Abridgment of the Christian Doc-
trine, page 58.
                    Centuries of Papal Supremacy •
   12. How long was this power to continue? Dan. 7:25, last part.

   No-I-E.—According to Scripture usage, the word "time" is also employed as
the equivalent for "year." See Daniel 11:13, margin ; also various modern ver-
sions of the Bible. The "American Translation" renders the text: "They shall
be handed over to him for a year, two years, and half a year," or three and
a half years. In harmony with prophetic reckoning, which was 360 days to
each year, and thirty days to each month, three and a half years equal 1260
days.
                                     [ 23 1
    13. In the figurative language of Scripture, what period of time
is represented by a "day"? Num. 14:34; Ezek. 4:6.

    NorE.—The authority of the papal church over the saints, the times, and
the law of God was therefore to be limited to 1260 years.
   14. How does history testify to the fulfillment of this time
prophecy?
    ANSWER: The imperial decree of Justinian A.D. 533 recognized the suprem-
acy of the pope of Rome; while with the decisive battle in the overthrow of
the Ostrogoths A.D. 538 the decree became effective. Then observe the exact-
ness of prophetic fulfillment. From the decree of Justinian marking the estab-
lishment of the papacy, to the decree of the French Convention in 1793, re-
pudiating that authority, is exactly 1260 years. Again, from A.D. 538 when
Pope Vigilius was elevated as universal pontiff, to the time when Pope Pius VI
was dethroned and driven into exile in 1798, is also 1260 years. The fulfilled
prophecy is thus attested in duplicate.
                             Truth Vindicated
   15. In what language does Daniel state the sequel to this proph-
ecy? Dan. 7:21, 22.
    NoTE.—Not long after the death of the exiled pope, another was chosen to
 wear the triple crown; and with the march of events there has also developed
 an astonishing revival of papal power and prestige. This is in full accord with
 the prophetic forecast; for this prophecy indicates that the papacy is to con-
-tinue some form of activity until the time of the final judgment.
    In this seventh chapter of Daniel, prophecy spoke, history responded, and
 the Bible student is deeply impressed with the "photographic accuracy" with
 which every part of this prophetic drama has been fulfilled.

                      Lesson 9, for May 28, 1949
                  The Wonderful Numberer
   LESSON SCRIPTURE: Dan. 8:1-27.
   MEMORY VERSE: "Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the
government shall be upon His shoulder: and His name shall be called Wonderful,
Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace." Ica. 9:6.
   STUDY HELPS: "Daniel and the Revelation," pages 149-191.
   AIM: To study the introduction to one of the most far-reaching and sublime
prophecies of Scripture; and to be confident with the apostle that "we have also a
more sure word of prophecy." 2 Peter 1:19.
                        The Medo-Persian Epoch
   1. State the time, place, and the two principal actors of the third
notable prophecy of Daniel. Dan. 8:1-5.

   NoTE.—Modern archaeological discoveries establish the third year of Bel-
shazzar as 550 B.C. The prophet-statesman was evidently paying an official
                                      [ 24 ]
visit to Shushan, the capital of Elam province, which was located about two
hundred miles southeast of Babylon.
  2. What nations were symbolized by the ram and the rough
goat? Dan. 8:20, 21, first part.

   NoTE.—Since this vision occurred within a few months of Babylon's over-
throw, that nation was naturally omitted from the prophetic forecast.
                            The Grecian Era
   3. In the vision by the river what deadly struggle ensued? Dan.
8:6, 7.

    NorE.—Under Alexander the Great the Grecian goat, "in the fury of his
power," attacked the Persian ram that was "standing before the river." In
fulfillment of this prophetic imagery we observe that the first great onslaught
of the Greeks was at the river Granicus, the last at Arbela, near the river
Tigris. Of this final engagement Arrian, the historian, relates that the Mace-
donians "charged with great fury;" so "there was none that could deliver" the
defeated Darius from the victorious Alexander.
   4. When the great horn was broken, what then occurred? Dan.
8:8.

   5. Following the early death of Alexander the Great, what de-
velopments took place? Dan. 8:22.

   NoTE.—In narrating the history of those times the distinguished Philip Van
Ness Myers describes the international chaos that followed Alexander's death,
then states: "Four well-defined and important monarchies rose out of the
ruins. . . . Their rulers were Lysimachus, Cassander, Seleucus Nicator, and
Ptolemy, who had each assumed the title of king. The great horn was broken;
and instead of it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven."
—History of Greece, 1902 ed., page 457.
                        Rome—World Dictator
  6. From one of the four horns of the goat, what came forth?
Dan. 8:9.

   NOTE.—As will be shown, the "little horn" denoted Rome. She conquered
Egypt to the south, Syria to the east, and in 63 B.C., Judea, "the pleasant
land," became a province of the Roman Empire.
   7. How was the rise and work of this "little horn" interpreted
by the angel Gabriel? Dan. 8:23. Compare Deuteronomy 28:49, 50.

   Nora.—It will be observed that the divine spokesman described Medo-
Persia as "great," Greece as "very great," while the succeeding kingdom was
to become "exceeding great." Accordingly this third power can be none other
                                     [ 25 ]
than the mighty empire that followed Greece—the monarchy of Rome. Of
this nation an ancient writer observes: "Almost the whole inhabited world
was conquered, and brought under the dominion of the single city of Rome."
—Histories of Polybius, b. 1, ch. 1.
   8. In what language is the agelong and oppressive rule of Rome
further described? Dan. 8:10, 24.

    NoTE.—For many centuries Rome waged relentless warfare against the
truth and the "host" or people of God. Multitudes of the Jews were destroyed,
while millions of Christians suffered bitter persecution and martyrdom. The
"stars" here mentioned evidently refer to the "shining lights" or leaders in the
service of God, many of whom sacrificed their lives in defense of truth.
   9. Against whom did this power at length magnify itself? Dan.
8:11, 25.

   NoTE.—A Roman governor issued the order that nailed the Son of God to
a Roman cross; also by this act of arrogant impiety, Rome committed the
crime of crimes.
   10. How did this heartbreaking spectacle affect Daniel? Dan.
8:27.

                     Righteousness Will Triumph
  11. As Rome's dark reign of terrorism appeared endless, what
question was addressed to the wonderful numberer? Dan. 8:13,
margin.

  NoTE.—In other words, How long were the people of God to be "trodden
underfoot"? How long would the grim specter continue of—
                  "Right forever on the scaffold,
                   Wrong forever on the throne"?
   12. Repeat the answer of the wonderful numberer. Dan. 8:14.

    NoTE.—The implication is clear. The cleansing of the sanctuary is God's
answer to the apparent and temporary triumph of evil. Error and tyranny
may prosper for a time; but in the just balances of the sanctuary a righteous
judgment will be rendered and the sin problem will be completely and finally
solved.
         "The Vision Belongeth to the Time of the End"
                      (Dan. 8:17, R.V.)
   13. At the time Daniel fainted, what feature of this vision was
left unexplained? Compare Daniel 8:14 (margin) with verse 26. .

   NoTE.—In the prophecy of Daniel 8 four symbols are presented—the ram,
the goat,
    _         li
              ttle_ horn,
          the little horn, and the 2300 days. The first three of these were in-
                                        1
terpreted by the angel Gabriel. However, the period of time (the "evenings
and mornings," R.V.), was merely mentioned in verse 26, but was left unex-
plained, and was not understood. See verse 27.
   14. What statements of the angel Gabriel place the conclusion
of this vision at "the time of the end"? Dan. 8:17, 19.

   NOTE.—" 'Understand, 0 mortal man! for the vision relates to the time of
the end.' . . . The vision relates to the appointed end of all." Daniel 8:17-19,
Smith and Goodspeed.


                       Lesson 10, for June 4, 1949

                "Unto the Messiah the Prince"
   LESSON SCRIPTURE: Dan. 9:1-27.
   MEMORY VERSE: "Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon
thy Holy City, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make
reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up
the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most holy." Dan.. 9:24.
   STUDY HELPS: "Daniel and the Revelation," pages 193-223.
   AIM: To study and appreciate prophecy's far-flung measuring line which is as
"sure as the stars."

                        The Unfinished Commission
  1. In the vision by the river Ulai what task was assigned to the
angel Gabriel? Dan. 8:16.

   NOTE.—At the time when Daniel fainted and the angel departed, the com-
mission had been fulfilled only in part. The significance of the 2300 days had
not been explained.
  2. With the establishment of the Medo-Persian regime, what
was Daniel's chief concern? Dan. 9:1, 2.

    NOTE.—Belshazzar's third year, 550 s.c., also marked the overthrow of the
Babylonian Empire, the establishment of Medo-Persian rule, and the begin-
ning of the reign of Darius the Mede. For approximately a half century Jeru-
salem had been a heap of ruins. The seventy years' Babylonian captivity fore-
told by Jeremiah had almost expired; it was nearly time for Israel to return
to the Judean homeland.
    Although he was a prophet, Daniel earnestly studied the sacred writings,
especially those of Jeremiah, and understood "by books." An intellectual
knowledge of the prophecies is essential, but a heart converted by this knowl-
edge is supremely indispensable. Daniel possessed both.
         A Remarkable Prayer and Its Immediate Answer
  3. How does Daniel's petition reveal the inner life of this great
man? Dan. 9:3-19.
                              27 )
    NorE.—"Daniel does not proclaim his own fidelity before the Lord. In-
stead of claiming to be pure and holy, this honored prophet humbly identifies
himself with the really sinful of Israel. . . . Ponder the prayer from the lips
of this man so highly favored of Heaven. With deep humiliation, with tears
and rending of heart, he pleads for himself and for his people. He lays his
soul open before God, confessing his own unworthiness, and acknowledging
the Lord's greatness and majesty."—The Sanctified Life, page 35.
    Consider also this cheering assurance: "If we as a people would pray as
Daniel prayed, and wrestle as he wrestled, humbling our souls before God, we
should realize as marked answers to our petitions as were granted to Daniel."
"The life of Daniel is an inspired illustration of true sanctification."—Ibid.,
pages 35, 36, 39.
   4. While Daniel was still bowed in prayer, what interrupted
his evening devotions? Dan. 9:20, 21.

   5. What extraordinary tribute was paid to Daniel? Dan. 9:23.

   6. Upon what important mission had Gabriel been sent? Dan.
9:22, 23.
   NorE.—In the vision of Daniel 8 the charge had been given: "Gabriel,
make this man to understand the vision." Verse 16. The angel now comes to
complete that commission, saying: "I am now come forth to give thee skill
and understanding," and bids him "consider the vision."
                            A Nation on Trial
   7. What period of time was allotted to the Jewish people? Dan.
9:24, first clause.

    NorE.-LThe word "determined," also translated "cut off," indicates that
the seventy weeks were to be cut off from a longer period, unquestionably from
the two thousand three hundred days of Daniel 8, which was the only unex-
plained feature of the previous vision.
   8. During this probationary period what six important features
of the prophecy were to be consummated? Dan. 9:24.

    NorE.—a. "To finish the transgression." By the rejection of the Messiah,
Israel's cup of iniquity would be filled to overflow.
    b. "To make an end of sins." Christ "put away sin by the sacrifice of
Himself."
    c. "To make reconciliation for iniquity." Reconciled by His triumphant
death. Rom. 5:10.
    d. "To bring in everlasting righteousness." Saved by His spotless, right-
eous life. Rom. 5:10.
    e. "To seal up the vision and prophecy." Every part and detail of the
seventy weeks being accurately fulfilled, the remaining portion of the 2300
days was sealed and divinely certified.
    f. "To anoint the most holy." When the tabernacle in the wilderness was
completed, there was a special service of anointing, both for the sanctuary and
                                    [28]
the priests. And the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle. See Exodus 40:
9-15, 34. This was the type of the inauguration of the priestly service Christ
was to begin in the heavenly sanctuary at His ascension. The Hebrew expres-
sion "most holy" is a term used freely in the Scriptures dealing with the sanc-
tuary services to characterize things and places, but is nowhere applied to
persons. Consistent with this use of "most holy," the prophecy pointed for-
ward to the anointing of the heavenly sanctuary at the Lord's ascension.
"When Christ passed within the heavenly gates, He was enthroned amidst the
adoration of the angels. As soon as this ceremony was completed, the Holy
Spirit descended upon the disciples in rich currents, and Christ was indeed
glorified, even with the glory which He had with the Father from all eternity.
The Pentecostal outpouring was Heaven's communication that the Redeemer's
inauguration was accomplished."—Acts of the Apostles, pages 38,39.
                        A Certified Chronology
  9. What event was to mark the beginning of the seventy weeks,
and consequently of the 2300 days? Dan. 9:25, first part.

    NorE.—There were three royal decrees issued by three Persian kings to
restore the Hebrew metropolis. Says the Scripture record: "They builded, and
finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according
to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia."
Ezra 6:14.
    The three decrees are here included in "the commandment" to rebuild.
The last and most comprehensive of these preserved for us in Holy Writ went
into effect in the seventh year of Artaxerxes, 457 B.C.
                           Prophetic Accuracy
  10. State the subdivisions of the seventy weeks' prophecy as
outlined by the angel Gabriel. Dan. 9:25, 27, first part.

  NOTE.—In symbolic prophecy, as will be revealed, Inspiration provides the
divine rule of reckoning: "I have appointed thee each day for a year." Ezek.
4:6. Accordingly, the seven weeks (forty-nine literal years) extended to 508
B.c., the year that Jerusalem was fully restored. See Nehemiah 13:1-31 and
Prideaux's Connections, part 1, book 6.
   11. With what memorable incident did the sixty-two weeks
terminate? Dan. 9:25.

   NorE.—From the restoration of Jerusalem in 508 Lc., sixty-two weeks
(434 years) extend to the autumn of A.D. 27, when Jesus the Messiah was
baptized in the old Jordan and anointed for service. Matt. 3:16, 17.
   12. At what time did Christ "confirm the covenant" by His
great sacrifice? Dan. 9:26, 27.

   NOTE.—From the time of Christ's baptism another three and a half years
extended to "the midst of the week," the spring of A.D. 31, at which time our
Saviour yielded His life on Calvary.
                                    [ 29
                         Rejection and Retribution
   13. In what way did nature itself witness to the death of the
Son of God? Matt. 27:50, 51.

    NOTE.—As the great clock of time struck the hour, the supreme moment
in the work of redemption arrived, and the promise of God was gloriously
fulfilled. This mirade signified that the shadowy ritual of the temple service
had been superseded by the sacrifice and ministry of Jesus Christ.
   14. As a result of the crucifixion and rejection of their Messiah,
what retribution was visited upon the Jewish nation and their be-
loved city? Dan. 9:26; Matt. 27:25.

    NorE.—"For nearly forty years after the doom of Jerusalem had been pro-
nounced by Christ Himself, the Lord delayed His judgments upon the city and
the nation. Wonderful was the long-suffering of God toward the rejectors of
His gospel and the murderers of His Son."
   "But when men pass the limits of divine forbearance . . . He leaves the
rejectors of His mercy to themselves, to reap that which they have sown.
Every ray of light rejected, every warning despised or unheeded, every pas-
sion indulged, every transgression of the law of God, is a seed sown, which
yields its unfailing harvest. . . . The destruction of Jerusalem is a fearful
and solemn warning to all who are trifling with the offers of divine grace, and
resisting the pleadings of divine mercy."—The Great Controversy, pages
27,36.

    MEMORY VERSE: "We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ;
that everyone may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done,

    STUDY HELPS: "The Great Controversy," pages 423-432, 479-491 (new ed.,
pages 483-493, 545-557); "Daniel and the Revelation," pages 167-189, 217-223.
   AIM: To feature Israel's tabernacle service as a type and figure of the priesthood
of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary, and to obtain a more vivid concept of our great
High Priest in the closing work of the investigative judgment.

              Milestones Along the Prophetic Highway
   1. When Gabriel was commissioned to explain to Daniel the
2300-day (year) period of Daniel 8:14, what introductory prophecy
was outlined? Dan. 9:24-47.

    NorE.—As conclusively shown in last week's lesson, the seventy weeks
(490 literal years) are a part of the 2300 days (years). Since the shorter
period was "cut off" from the longer, and both begin with the monumental
decree of Artaxerxes in the autumn of 457 B.C., the short period extended to
A.D. 34, and the whole 2300 years to A.D. 1844.
                                        1 30]
   At every prophetic milestone along the course of the 490 years the fore-
cast was definitely and literally fulfilled. "The vision and prophecy" bear the
seal and signet of divine authenticity; and as surely as Christ was sacrificed
"when the fullness of the time was come" in the middle of the seventieth week,
so surely did the cleansing of the sanctuary begin at the appointed time in
the year 1844.
                        The Gospel in Miniature
    2. What two sanctuaries are especially mentioned and described
in the Scriptures? Heb. 8:1, 2; 9:1, 2, 9.

  3. By what impressive ancient service was the necessity of free-
dom from sin emphasized? Lev. 4:27-31.

   NorE.—Like an ugly intruder, sin had entered the heart and home to sep-
arate man from his God. Here at the altar of the sanctuary full confession
was made, and the Lord forgave. Through the shedding of blood the sin of
the individual was transferred in type to the sanctuary.
   4. By what special ceremony was the earthly tabernacle, or sanc-
tuary, cleansed from the accumulated sins of the people? Lev. 16:
7-10, 15, 16, 29, 30, 33.
    NorE.—Once each year, on the auspicious tenth day of the seventh month,
all manner of work was to be laid aside, the entire congregation of Israel were
to reconsecrate themselves to God, and the sanctuary was to be cleansed from
every taint of sin.
                        The Priesthood of Christ
   5. Having died for us upon Calvary, to what position in heaven
did Christ ascend? Heb. 4:14; 6:19, 20; 1 John 2:1.

   6. As the earthly sanctuary, when defiled by sin, required cleans-
ing, what was also essential regarding the sanctuary above? Heb.
9:22, 23.
   7. Compare the annual service of cleansing the earthly taber-
nacle with the cleansing of the heavenly sanctuary. Heb. 9:25, 26.

                         The Day of Atonement
   8. In what apartment of the , ancient sanctuary were the daily
ministrations conducted? The yearly service of atonement? Heb.
9:6, 7.

   9. As the great antitypical day of atonement dawned, what oc-
curred in the "holy of holies" of the heavenly sanctuary? Dan. 7:9.
                                     131 1
    NOTE.—The phrase "cast down," from the Chaldee word remi, may be
correctly translated "to set, or place, in order." In harmony with this, the
American Revised Version, as well as the English Revised, states that the
"thrones were placed." The scene here described is most majestic and sublime.
   10. Who is escorted into the presence of the Ancient of Days
to occupy one of these thrones? Dan. 7:13.

   Nom.—"As in the typical service there was a work of atonement at the
close of the year, so before Christ's work for the redemption of men is com-
pleted, there is a work of atonement for the removal of sin from the sanctuary.
This is the service which began when the 2300 days ended. At that time, as
foretold by Daniel the prophet, our High Priest entered the most holy, to
perform the last division of His solemn work,—to cleanse the sanctuary."—
The Great Controversy, page 421.
   11. Who are in attendance at this august assemblage? What
statement indicates the judicial nature of the gathering? Dan. 7:10.

   NOTE.—In consideration of the countless millions of earth who have strug-
gled with right and wrong, what a prodigious task is here visualized! The
Scriptures mention various scrolls of record—the book of life, the book of
remembrance, and the register of sin and death. Phil. 4:3; Rev. 13:8; Mal.
3:16; Isa. 65:6, 7.
                   At the Judgment Seat of Christ
  12. Why is this court session of such vital import? How many
have a case pending before the bar of God? 2 Cor. 5:10.

   NoTE.—"Our acts, our words, even our most secret motives, all have their
weight in deciding our destiny for weal or woe. . . . Could the veil which
separates the visible from the invisible world be swept back, and the children
of men behold an angel recording every word and deed, which they must meet
again in the judgment, how many words that are daily uttered would remain
unspoken; how many deeds would remain undone."—The Great Controversy,
pages 486, 487.
   13. What statements of Scripture indicate that either one's name
or one's sins will be forever blotted out? Rev. 3:5; Acts 3:19.

   14. When the ministry of Christ in the "holy of holies" is fin-
ished, what fateful decree will be issued? Rev. 22:11, 12.

   NOTE.—"Silently, unnoticed as the midnight thief, will come the decisive
hour which marks the fixing of every man's destiny, the final withdrawal of
mercy's offer to guilty men. . . . While the man of business is absorbed in
the pursuit of gain, while the pleasure lover is seeking indulgence, while the
daughter of fashion is arranging her adornments,—it may be in that hour the
Judge of all the earth will pronounce the sentence, 'Thou art weighed in the
balances, and art found wanting.'"—The Great Controversy, page 491.

                       Lesson 12, for June 18, 1949

                       Daniel's Last Prophecy
    LESSON SCRIPTURE: Dan. 10:1-21; 11:1-45.
    MEMORY VERSE: "At that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which
standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as
never was since there was a nation even to that same- time: and at that time thy
pedple shall be delivered, everyone that shall be found written in the book." Dan. 12:1.
    STUDY HELPS: "Daniel and the Revelation," pages 225-229.
    AIM: To appreciate more fully the deep interest of heaven in human affairs, the
influence of angel ministry in earthly governments, and to trace the far-reaching out-
lines of prophecy as they crystallize into history.

                         Heavenly Agencies Active
    1. In the third year of Cyrus what remarkable experience came
to Daniel? Dan. 10:1-9.

    NorE.—About two years had elapsed since the expiration of the seventy
years' captivity and the decree of Cyrus authorizing the restoration of Jeru-
salem. Daniel was deeply distressed because so few of his people had returned
to the Holy Land, also because the enemies of the returned exiles "weakened
the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building," even send-
ing "hired counselors" to the court of Cyrus. Ezra 4:4,5.
 . 2. As the contest at the imperial court became grave, who ap-
peared to direct the forces of truth? Dan. 10:12, 13.

    NoTE.—A comparison of Jude 9 with 1 Thessalonians 4:16 and John 5:
26-29 reveals that Michael the Archangel is Christ.
    We read in the book of Ezra that there were enemies who sought to hinder
the work of rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem. These enemies "hired counsel-
ors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus" and later.
Ezra 4:5. This was probably the reason why an angel had been sent to Cyrus
to influence him to go forward with his work in behalf of restoring the temple
at Jerusalem. But there is delay for twenty-one days because Satan endeavors
to influence Cyrus against complying with God's will. During this time Daniel
prayed for an understanding of his vision. Finally Michael was sent to assist
Gabriel so that he might return to Daniel to communicate with him.
                         Kings of Persia and Greece
   3. With what prediction did Gabriel introduce the prophetic
outline? Dan. 11:2.

   NoTE.—In contrast to the other prophecies in the book of Daniel it will
be observed that this one is presented in literal, not symbolic, language.
   This vision occurred in the third year of Cyrus the Great. See Daniel 10:1.
The kings who followed him were Cambyses, Smerdis 'the imposter, Darius
Hystaspes, and Xerxes the Great. The latter, utilizing his vast resources, mar-
shaled a mighty army and marched against Greece, but was overwhelmingly
defeated.
                                         [ 33 ]
   4. Who was the next illustrious monarch to arise? Dan. 11:3.

   NOTE.—The overthrow of Xerxes' expeditionary forces in Greece was the
turning point in Persian history. Several weak emperors succeeded to the
throne of Persia; but the strength of the empire gradually decayed. At length
when the "mighty king" of Greece, Alexander the Great, arose to power, he
was able to subjugate a "great dominion, and do according to his will."
                The Kings of the North and the South
  5. Following Alexander's mastery of the civilized world, what
was to occur? Dan. 11:4.

   NorE.—While still in early manhood, Alexander died in 323 B.c. His vast
empire was torn into four kingdoms, "toward the four winds of heaven," and
ruled by four of Alexander's most aspiring generals. The forecast, "not to his
posterity" was also literally fulfilled; for before attaining to the years of man-
hood, his sons fell victims to the jealousy and ambition of others.
                          Rome and the Papacy
   6. In the prophecy of Daniel 11, what world power was next
introduced?

    ANSWER: The phrase, "the robbers of thy people," in verse 14, is without
doubt a reference to the Romans. They "exalt themselves to establish the
vision ;" and more than any other people or nation, they occupy an important
place in Daniel's prophecy. The "raiser of taxes" (verse 20)., is understood to
have been Augustus Caesar. See Luke 2:1.
    The "vile person" of verses 21 and 22 is undoubtedly Tiberius Caesar, dur-
ing whose reign "the Prince of the covenant" was crucified.
   "The league" of mutual friendship (verse 23) between the Romans and
the Jews was formed in 161 B.c. Subsequently the Jews learned to their sor-
row that Rome worked most artfully and "deceitfully."
   7. When at length "the abomination that maketh desolate" was
established, what people became strong to "do exploits"? Dan.
11:31, 32.

   NoTE.—As the Church of Rome developed strength, she aspired to bring
emperors and princes, nations and peoples, under her authority. In many
lands dissenters arose, and accepting the Bible as their guide, were resolutely
determined to follow its teachings. They resisted the authority of the papacy,
and with thrilling admiration the world still reads the record of their heroic
"exploits" for God. Among these may be mentioned the Waldenses, the Albi-
genses, and the Anabaptists, together with the Lutherans, Presbyterians, and
others in the days of the Protestant Reformation.
   8. To what time was this era of persecution to extend? Dan. 11:
33-35.

  NOTE.—As will be recalled, the 1260 years of papal supremacy foretold in
Daniel 7:25 terminated in 1798.
                                 I 84 ]
                         At the Time of the End
   9. As the power and prestige of the papacy went into tempo-
rary eclipse, what "king," or kingdom, was enabled to "do accord-
ing to his will"? Dan. 11:36, 37.

    NOTE.-At the close of the eighteenth century France was regarded as the
foremost nation of Europe. During the French Revolution and in the years
that followed, that atheistic government assumed the leading role in terminat-
ing the papal regime. A French general at the head of a French army arrested
the pope of Rome in 1798, and sent him into exile.
    "The time had come for the papal power to be dealt a deadly wound. This
infidel power was to be the agency of divine indignation to strike that blow.
The lapse into atheism in the French Revolution is one of the dramatic and
tragic incidents of history. No, nation before had ever made a declaration of
stark atheism, declaring they would not have 'any god.' France proposed 'to
dethrone the King of heaven, as well as the monarchs of the earth.'"—W. A.
Spicer, Beacon Lights of Prophecy, page 128.
   10. What "strange god" was this power to honor? Dan. 11:
38, 39.

    NorE.—As a commentary upon the phrase, "honor the god of forces,"
Napoleon is said to have held the opinion that God is on the side of the heav-
iest artillery; also to have asserted: "I have always followed the God of War,
and Fortune and the God of War are with me."—BAcon Lights of Prophecy,
page 129.
   11. For what purpose was the land to be divided? Dan. 11:39.

   NoTE.—At the beginning of the French Revolution at least two thirds of
the rich agricultural lands of France were held in vast estates by the nobility
and the clergy. Communistic theories, combined with military necessity, de-
manded that these extensive holdings by the princes of both church and state
be broken up and sold "for gain"—to replenish the depleted treasury and fur-
nish the sinews of war.
             Kings of the South and North in Conflict
   12. On the prophetic chart what triangular war was scheduled
for "the time of the end"? Dan. 11:40.

    NorE.—For many decades it has been the generally accepted belief of
Seventh-day Adventists that this language describes the spectacular assault of
the French upon Egypt and Turkey. These kingdoms occupy, respectively,
the traditional territories of "the king of the south" and "the king of the
north," as shown by the fulfillment of Dan. 11:5-13.
    It was the memorable year of 1798, and while one French army penetrated
Italy to dethrone the pope, a strong expeditionary force under Napoleon in-
vaded Egypt. "The king of the south" "pushed" at the French with but feeble
and unavailing effort; while a few months later, Turkey, "the king of the
north," came against Napoleon "like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with
                                     [ 35 )
horsemen, and with many ships." The fury of this attack was amazing, and
for the first time in his notable career, Napoleon was forced to issue the order
for a hasty retreat.
   13. What subsequent victories were to be achieved by "the king
of the north"? Dan. 11:41-43.

   NOTE.—Palestine, "the glorious land," was held as a Turkish province until
near the close of World War I. For many years the authority of the Ottoman
Empire 'extended over Egypt, even to the Libyan and Ethiopian borders;
while true to the prophecy, the ancient lands of Edom, Moab, and Ammon
escaped the domination of Turkey.
                      Approaching the World Crisis
   14. In the march of fulfilling prophecy what fate awaits "the
king of the north"? Dan. 11:45.

    Norc.—For more than a century the power of Turkey has been dwindling.
She now possesses but a semblance of her former strength and greatness.
    "It is predicted of the king of the north that 'he shall come to his end, and
none shall help him.' Just how and when and where his end will come, we
may watch with solemn interest, knowing that the hand of Providence guides
the destiny of nations.
    "Time will soon determine this matter. When this event takes place, what
follows?—events of the most momentous interest to all the inhabitants of this
world."—The Prophecies of Daniel and the Revelation, page 299.


                      Lesson 13, for June 25, 1949

                   Nearing the Journey's End
   LESSON SCRIPTURE: Dan. 12:1-13.
   MEMORY VERSE: "But thou, 0 Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book,
even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be in-
creased." Dan. 12:4.
   STUDY HELPS: "Daniel and the Revelation," pages 301-334.
   AIM: To study the prophetic word spoken twenty-five hundred years ago, to
view that word outspanning the centuries and bursting to fulfillment in this dazzling
age of scientific achievement.

                             Michael Stands       up
    1. As the king of the north comes to his end (Dan. 11:45), what
change in the office and work of Christ is indicated? Dan. 12:1,
first part.

   NOTE.—The prophecy of Daniel 8 and 9 reveals that since 1844 Christ has
been ministering as our High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary. When that
                                       [ 36 ]
service has been accomplished, the door of mercy will close. Every case will
have been decided for eternity. Probation will end. Michael stands up, lays
aside His priestly garments, and is clothed with royal robes to come forth
as "King of kings, and Lord of lords." See Barly Writings, page 279-281;
The Great Controversy, page 613.
   2. What will then occur on the earth? Dan. 12:1, second clause.

    NoTE.—In our Lord's great prophecy He foretold a "great tribulation,
such as was not since the beginning of the world." Matt. 24:21. This pre-
diction was fulfilled in the relentless persecution of the church during the
1260 years of papal supremacy; while "the time of trouble" forecast by Daniel
is still future. It is not primarily or principally to be a time of religious perse-
cution, but of international calamity, and includes the scourge of the seven
last plagues. See Revelation 16. During that ordeal the promises of God
recorded in Psalms 46 and 91 will be exceedingly precious to the "little flock."
   3. To whom is deliverance promised? Dan. 12:1, last part.

                              Priceless Awards
   4. What significant event then occurs? Dan. 12:2.

   NorE.—These words cannot refer to the resurrection of the righteous at
the second coming of Christ, for at that time only the saints are to be raised.
The following inspired comment clearly explains this text:
   "All who have died in the faith of the third angel's message come forth
from the tomb glorified, to hear God's covenant of peace with those who have
kept His law. 'They also which pierced Him,' those that mocked and derided
Christ's dying agonies, and the most violent opposers of His truth and His
people, are raised to behold Him in His glory, and to see the honor placed
upon the loyal and obedient."—The Great Controversy, page 637.
  5. What glorious reward awaits those who are soul winners for
Christ? Dan. 12:3.
    NoTE.—The marginal reading for "wise" is "teachers." "What a soul-
winning text ! We must not be content to go to heaven alone. We should
love men, pray for men, seek men, and save men. A single soul is worth a
lifelong hunt. First have a face-to-face talk with Jesus, then you can have
a face-to-face talk with the sinner."—Charles G. Bellah, The Hero of Babylon,
page 183.
                         This Unprecedented Age
    6. What instruction was given to Daniel? Dan. 12:4, first part.

    NOTE.—Since this book was closed only until the time of the end, it is
reasonable to expect that the seal would be broken and the book opened when
the time of the end is reached. Also as shown in the previous lesson, the age
following the 1260-year period of Rome's supremacy is specifically designated
as "the time of the end." Dan. 11:33-35.
    This expression occurs four times in the prophecies of Daniel, and em-
                                     [ 37 ]
phasizes the vital significance of the year 1798 as the commencement of "the
time of the end." There are also at least nine direct statements in this book
pointing to the closing period of earth's history.
  7. According to the divine forecast, what developments would
characterize "the time of the end"? Dan. 12:4, last part.
    NoTE.--As the papacy received its "deadly wound" in 1798 and its im-
perious power was broken, a new era dawned. Bible students were inspired
to study the prophecies diligently. The little book was unsealed. Light shone
upon the pages of the word to gladden the hearts of men and women. Bible
societies were organized: and missionaries began running "to and fro" through-
out the earth with the good tidings.
    Likewise, the intellectual faculties of man were awakened to new ideas,
thrilling discoveries, and baffling inventions. The long-hidden powers of
steam, gas, electricity, the X ray, the radio, together with the automobile, the
airplane and thousands of other scientific wonders, have revolutionized the
world. And
         '    now we enter ,the atomic age with its untold powers and possi-
bilities for weal or woe. How marvelously is knowledge increased! And with
what speed and convenience are the millions of earth enabled to "run to and
fro"! The Bible now speaks to the hearts of men in 1,090 languages (June,
1948) ; while the message of Christ's return is today being proclaimed in more
than eight hundred tongues and dialects. The words of Isaiah are indeed ful-
filled: "The Lord hath made bare His holy arm in the eyes of all the nations;
and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God." Isa. 52:10.
  8. Utilizing these modern means of transportation and com-
munication, what mighty task is to be accomplished? Matt. 24:14.

   NoTE.—None should conceive that these marvelous inventions were given
the world merely to provide for the comfort, convenience, and progress of
mankind. In them the Christian sees something infinitely greater—a divine
purpose for speeding the news of Christ's return to "every nation, and kindred,
and tongue, and people."
                      Close of the Prophetic Days
   9. What question was asked by a celestial visitor? Dan. 12:6.

   10. What reply was given by "the man clothed in linen"? Dan.
12:7.
    NoTE.—The prophetic period, "a time, times, and a half," here repeated,
emphasizes the fact of its importance. In the books of Daniel and Revelation
the time of Rome's supremacy (1260 days, literal years), is stated seven times.
Assurance was given that at the close of that period relief would surely come
to the persecuted and scattered "holy people."
   11. As Daniel requested clear understanding, what was he in-
structed to do? Dan. 12:8-10.

   12. To more fully establish "the time of the end," what addi-
tional prophetic period was announced? Dan. 12:11.
                                     I 88
     NorE.-LEmploying the marginal rendering, the text reads: "From the time
  that the daily [sacrifice, supplied] shall be taken away to set up the abomina-
  tion," etc. That is, from A.D. 508, when by the victory of Clovis room and
  opportunity were provided for the establishment of the papacy, until the
  "time of the end," would be 1290 days (literal years). After presenting evi-
  dence from numerous church historians, the author of The Prophecies of
  Daniel and the Revelation states: "Thus in Am. 508 terminated united resist-
  ance to the development of the papacy."—Page 330.
      13. Upon whom is a special blessing pronounced? Dan. 12:12.

      NOTE.—Beginning at the same date, A.D. 508, 1335 days (literal years) ex-
  tend to 1843-44, the time when the world-wide proclamation was given: "The
  hour of His judgment is come." Light concerning the ministry of our great
  High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary gladdened the hearts of Bible students,
  Christ was entering upon His closing work as man's Advocate and Judge,
  and His people were to maintain patience until the records of all were settled
  in the just balances of the sanctuary.
                      Conclusion: The Radiant Sunset
     14. As his sunset hour was approaching, what last, loving mes-
  sage was conveyed to Daniel? Dan. 12:13.

      NorE.—From his youth Daniel had ever stood for principle. He could
  stand before kings, before enemies, and before lions. For more than seventy
  years he had witnessed faithfully in the courts of Babylon and Shushan. With
  this man "greatly beloved," no fault could be found; and now the parting
  word, and the glorious promise of the future.
