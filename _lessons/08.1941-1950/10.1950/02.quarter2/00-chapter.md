ture on Sabbath morning, but by careful study for the next week on Sabbath afternoon,
with daily review or illustration during the week. Thus the lesson will become fixed in
the memory, a treasure never to be wholly lost."—"Education," pages 251, 252.

    ITS RESPONSIBILITIES AND BLESSINGS
                        Lesson 1, for April 1, 1950

              The Creator and Upholder of All
   MEMORY VERSE: "In the beginning was the Word,' and the Word was with
God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things
were made by Him; and without Him was not anything made that was made." John
1:1-3.
   STUDY HELP: S. A. Wellman, "Your Stewardship and Mine," chapter 1.
   INTRODUCTORY NOTE: "The works of creation testify of God's poWer and
greatness. 'The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament showeth His
handiwork.' Those who take the written word as their counselor will find in science
an aid to understand God. 'The invisible things of Him from the creation of the
world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal
power and Godhead.' "—"Patriarchs and Prophets," page 116.
                           DAILY STUDY ASSIGNMENT
   1.   General survey of the lesson.    5. "Your Stewardship and Mine," Intro-
   2.   Questions 1-4.                        duction and first half of chapter 1.
   3.   Questions 5-8.                   6. "Your Stewardship and Mine," sec-
   4.   Question 9-14.                        ond half of chapter 1.
                                         7. Review.

                       God's Claim to All Creation
   1. To whom do the earth and all who dwell therein belong?
Ps. 24:1.
  2. Why can God justly claim the earth and its inhabitants as
His? Ps. 24:2.

    3. By what means did God create the earth? Ps. 33:6, 9.

   NoTE.—Creation was accomplished, not through some long period of
years but instantly, at God's spoken word. And to this day the evidence of
the power of this word is before us, for "God created the seed, as He created
the earth, by His word. By His word He gave it power to grow and multi-
ply. . . . Every seed that sends up its green blade to the sunlight declares
the wonder-working power of the word uttered by Him who `spake, and it
was;' who 'commanded, and it stood fast.'"—Christ's Object Lessons, pages
80,81.
   4. How fully does God claim ownership of- the earth? Ps.
50:10-12.
                                         [3]
   5. What claim does God make to the silver and gold? Haggai 2:8.

   6. In what beautiful prayer does David acknowledge God's claim
to all things? 1 Chron. 29:10-14.

   NOTE.—"All things are God's, not only by creation, but by redemption.
All the blessings of this life and of the life to come, are delivered to us
stamped with the cross of Calvary."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 362.

                          Christ and Creation
   7. By whom was the work of creation effected? Col. 1:14-16.

   8. How completely was Christ identified with God in this work?
John 1:1-3, 14.

    NOTE.—"In the beginning, God was revealed in all the works of creation.
It was Christ that spread the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth.
It was His hand that hung the worlds in space, and fashioned the flowers of
the field. . . . It was He that filled the earth with beauty, and the air with
song. And upon all things in earth, and air, and sky, He wrote the message
of the Father's love."—The Desire of Ages, page 20.

                The Place of Man in God's Creation
   9. Over what did God give man dominion? Gen. 1:28; Ps. 8:6-8.

   NoTE.—"He [man] was placed, as God's representative, over the lower
orders of being. They cannot understand or acknowledge the sovereignty of
God, yet they were made capable of loving and serving man."—Patriarchs
and Prophets, page 45.
  10. What specific work did God commit to the hands of Adam?
Gen. 2:15.

   NOTE.—"To the dwellers in Eden was committed the care of the garden,
`to dress it and to keep it.' Their occupation was not wearisome, but
pleasant and invigorating. God appointed labor as a blessing to man, to
occupy his mind, to strengthen his body, and to develop his faculties. In
mental and physical activity, Adam found one of the highest pleasures of his
holy existence."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 50.
   11. What limitation did God place on man? Gen. 2:16, 17.

   NoTE.—"The Lord created every tree in Eden pleasant to the eyes and
good for food, and He bade Adam and Eve freely enjoy His bounties. But
He made one exception. Of the tree of knowledge of good and evil they were
not to eat. This tree God reserved as a constant reminder of His ownership
                                    [4]
of all. Thus He gave them opportunity to demonstrate their faith and trust
in Him by their perfect obedience to His requirements."—Testimonies, vol.
6, p. 386.
                        Man's Relationship to God
   12. In the parable of the talents how did Jesus portray God's
relationship to man? Luke 19:12-15.

   13. What fundamental attribute is required of a steward? 1 Cor.
4:2. Compare Luke 12:48, second sentence.

   14. What consideration should influence our service for God?
1 Sam. 12:24.

                        Lesson 2, for April 8, 1950
                Ancient Israel's Call to Service
    MEMORY VERSE: "Ye are My witnesses, saith the Lord, and My servant whom
I have chosen: that ye may know and believe Me, and understand that I am He:
before Me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after Me." Isa. 43:10.
    STUDY HELP: S. A. Wellman, "Your Stewardship and Mine," chapter 2.
    INTRODUCTORY NOTE: "God called Israel, and blessed and exalted them,
not that by obedience to His law they alone might receive His favor, and become the
exclusive recipients of His blessings, but in order to reveal Himself through them
to all the inhabitants of the earth. It was for the accomplishment of this very purpose
that He commanded them to keep themselves distinct from the idolatrous nations
around them."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," page 369.
                         DAILY STUDY ASSIGNMENT
   I. General survey of the lesson.    5. "Your Stewardship and Mine," first
   2. Questions 1-5.                        half of chapter 2.
   3. Questions 6-8.                   6. "Your Stewardship and Mine," sec-
   4. Questions 9-14.                       and half of chapter 2.
                                       7. Review.

                   Man's Disobedience and Its Results
  1. Before the creation of this world what provisiOn did God
make to ensure the realization of His purpose for man? 2 Tim. 1:9;
Eph. 1:4.

   NOTE.—"The plan for our redemption was not an afterthought, a plan
formulated after the fall of Adam. It was a revelation of 'the mystery which
hath been kept in silence through times eternal.' Rom. 16:25, R.V. It was
an unfolding of the principles that from eternal ages have been the founda-
tion of God's throne. From the beginning, God and Christ knew of the
apostasy of Satan, and of the fall of man through the deceptive power of
                                     C5 ]
the apostate. God did not ordain that sin should exist, but He foresaw its
existence, and made provision to meet the terrible emergency."—The Desire
of Ages, page 22.
   2. As a result of Adam's disobedience, into what condition did
he fall? Gen. 3:17-19; Rom. 5:12; 2 Peter 2:19, last clause.

   NOTE.—"Adam, in his innocence, had enjoyed open communion with his
Maker; but sin brought separation between God and man, and the atonement
of Christ alone could span the abyss, and make possible the communication of
blessing or salvation from heaven to earth. Man was still cut off from
direct approach to His creator, but God would communicate with him
through Christ and angels."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 67.

   3. What examples of loyalty and disloyalty were seen in Adam's
sons? Gen. 4:3-5.

   4. What conditions prevailed in the lives of men before the
Flood? Gen. 6:5-7.

   5. Following the Flood, how did Noah acknowledge God's sav-
ing and keeping power? Gen. 8:20.

    NorE.—"Here was a lesson for all succeeding generations. Noah had come
forth upon a desolate earth; but before preparing a house for himself, he
built an altar to God. His stock of cattle was small, and had been preserved
at great expense; yet he cheerfully gave a part to the Lord, as an acknowledg-
ment that all was His. In like manner it should be our first care to render
our freewill offerings to God."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 106.

        The Call to Stewardship in the Patriarchal Age
   6. What call was made to Abram? What was God's purpose in
this call? Gen. 12:1-5;

   7. What witness is given that Abraham fully acknowledged
God's love and power, and His ownership of all things? Gen. 12:8;
14:20.

  8. What experience came to Jacob as he journeyed to Haran?
What act of worship did he perform? What pledge did he make?
Gen. 28:10-22.

                  At the Crossroads of the Nations
   9. What responsibility did God place upon His people? Isa.
43:10-12.
                                     f6 1
    NoTE.—"Often the Israelites seemed unable or unwilling to understand
God's purpose for the heathen. Yet it was this very purpose that had made
them a separate people, and had established them as an independent nation
among the nations of the earth. Abraham, their father, to whom the cove-
nant promise was first given, had been called to go forth from his kindred,
to the regions beyond, that he might be a light bearer to the heathen. Al-
though the promise to him included a posterity as numerous as the sand by
the sea, yet it was for no selfish purpose that he was to become the founder
of a great nation in the land of Canaan. God's covenant with him embraced
all the nations of earth."—Prophets and Kings, pages 367, 368.
    10. What was God's purpose in choosing Israel to be His pecu-
liar people? Deut. 26:17-19.

   11. What made Israel a separate and distinct people? Ex.
33:14-16.

   12. Why were Israel instructed to keep themselves separate from
the heathen nations about them? Deut. 7:2-4.

  13. What was to be their relation to the strangers who came to
dwell among them? Ex. 12:43-49; 20:10; Lev. 19:34.

   Norg.—"God had made provision that all who would renounce heathen-
ism, and connect themselves with Israel, should share the blessings of the
covenant. . . . With few exceptions this class were to enjoy equal favors
and privileges with Israel."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 507.
   14. Had Israel obeyed God's instruction, what would have been
their relation to Him? Ex. 19:5, 6.


                       Lesson 3, for April 15, 1950

            A Spiritual Stewardship Neglected
    MEMORY VERSE: "After seventy years be accomplished at Babylon I will
visit you, and perform My good word toward you, in causing you to return to this
place. For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the Lord, thoughts of
peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end." Jer. 29:10, 11.
    STUDY HELP: S. A. Wellman, "Your Stewardship and Mine," chapter 3.
    INTRODUCTORY NOTE: "In his study of the causes leading to the Babylonish
captivity, Ezra had learned that Israel's apostasy was largely traceable to their min-
gling with heathen nations. . . .
    "The sorrow of Ezra and his associates over the evils that had insidiously crept
into the very heart of the Lord's work, wrought repentance. Many of those who had
sinned, were deeply affected. 'The people wept very sore.' In a limited degree they
began to realize the heinousness of sin, and the horror with which God regards it. They
saw the sacredness of the law spoken at Sinai, and many trembled at the thought of
their transgressions."—"Prophets and Kings," pages 620-622.
                                           7
                           DAILY STUDY ASSIGNMENT
   1.   General survey of the lesson.          5. "Your Stewardship and Mine," first
   2.   Questions 1-5.                              half of chapter 3.
   3.   Questions 6-10.                        6. "Your Stewardship and Mine," sec-
   4.   Questions 11-15.                            ond half of chapter 3.
                                               7. Review.

                       Israel's Spiritual Responsibility
   1. What did God declare would be the result if Israel would
carry out His will? Deut. 28:10-13.
   NorE.—"Had Israel been true to God, He could have accomplished His
purpose through their honor and exaltation. If they had walked in the ways
of obedience, He would have made them 'high above all nations which He
hath made, in praise, and in name, and in honor.' All people of the earth,'
said Moses, 'shall see that thou art called by the name of the Lord; and they
shall be afraid of thee.' The nations which shall hear all these statutes' shall
say, 'Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.' "—The
Desire of Ages, page 28.
  2. How soon after entering Canaan did Israel begin to forget
God? Joshua 24:31; Judges 2:10-13.

   3. Because of Israel's disloyalty to God, whom did He leave in
the land to prove Israel? Judges 2:20-23; 3:1, 3, 4.

   4. How did God signalize His acceptance of His sanctuary in
Israel when Solomon's temple was completed? 2 Chron. 5:1, 13, 14;
7:1-3.
  5. In his dedicatory prayer, for whom, among others, did Solo-
mon pray? 1 Kings 8:41-43.

                   The Decline and Captivity of Israel
   6. When Israel again forgot God, and disobeyed His commands,
what conditions again prevailed in both Israel and Judah? 1 Kings
14:21-24; 12:26-31.

    NoTE.—"From the time of Jeroboam's death to Elijah's appearance before'
Ahab, the people of Israel suffered a steady spiritual decline. Ruled by men
who did not fear Jehovah and who encouraged strange forms of worship,
the larger number of the people rapidly lost sight of their duty to serve the
living God, and adopted many of the practices of idolatry."—Prophets and
Kings, page 109.
   7. No longer able to bear Israel's rebellions, what did God even-
tually permit to come upon them? 2 Kings 17:5, 6. (Amos 7:11.)
                                        [8 ]
    NOTE.—The Lord permitted Samaria to be invaded "by the hosts of
Assyria under Shalmaneser; and in the siege that followed, multitudes
perished miserably of hunger and disease as well as by the sword. The city
and nation fell, and the broken remnant of the ten tribes were carried away
captive, and scattered in the provinces of the Assyrian realm. . . . The
Assyrians were merely the instruments that God used to carry out His
purpose.. . .
    "Not all who were carried captive were impenitent. . . . Through these,
`the sons of the living God,' He would bring multitude's in the Assyrian realm
to a knowledge of the attributes of His character and the beneficence of His
law."—Prophets and Kings, pages 291, 292.
   8. Because of Judah's failure to be warned from the experience
that had overtaken Israel, what successive punishment came to them
and to the Holy City? 2 Kings 24:1, 10-16; 25:8-11.

    NOTE.—"The enemy swept down like a resistless avalanche, and devas-
tated the city. The Hebrew armies were beaten back in confusion. The nation
was conquered. Zedekiah was taken prisoner, and his sons were slain before
his eyes. The king was led away from Jerusalem a captive, his eyes were
put out, and after arriving in Babylon he perished miserably. The beautiful
temple that for more than four centuries had crowned the summit of Mount
Zion, was not spared by the Chaldeans. . . . Zion was utterly destroyed; the
people of God were in their captivity."—Prophets and Kings, pages 458-461.

                  Promises of Restoration Fulfilled

   9. What foreign monarch did God use in preparing the way
for His people to be restored to their own land? Ezra 1:1-4. Com-
pare Isa. 44:28 and 45:1, 13.

    Nora.—God had promised through Jeremiah the prophet that Israel
would be given an opportunity to return to Canaan at the end of the seventy
years of captivity. (Jer. 29:10; 2 Chron. 36:21.)
   "Just at the time God had said He would cause His temple at Jerusalem
to be rebuilt, He moved upon Cyrus as His agent to discern the prophecies
concerning himself, with which Daniel was so familiar, and to grant the
Jewish people their liberty."—Prophets and Kings, page 557.
   10. Under what Persian king was the promise definitely and
finally carried out? Ezra 7:11, 21-26. Compare 6:14.

   11. What lesson did the Israelites who returned to their own
land seek to learn? Neh. 8:1-3, 8.

    NoTE.—"Wherever Ezra labored, there sprang up a revival in the study
of the Holy Scriptures. Teachers were appointed to instruct the people; the
law of the Lord was exalted and made honorable. The books of the prophets
were searched, and the passages foretelling the coming of the Messiah brought
hope and comfort to many a sad and weary heart. . . . Through the cen-
                                     C 93
tuHes, the record of his [Ezra's] life of consecration has inspired many with
the determination 'to seek the law of the Lord, and to do it.' "—Prophets
and Kings, page 623.
   12. What followed their study of God's law? How did they
relate themselves to the Sabbath? Neh. 10:28-31.

  13. What pledges did they make concerning the support of the
house and worship of God? Neh. 10:32-37.

   NOTE.—"Provision was also made to support the public worship of God.
In addition to the tithe, the congregation pledged themselves to contribute
yearly a stated sum for the service of the sanctuary. . . . Israel had returned
to God with deep sorrow for backsliding. They had made confession with
mourning and lamentation. They had acknowledged the righteousness of
God's dealings with them, and had covenanted to obey His law."—Prophets
and Kings, page 667.
   14. In spite of their promises, what weighty obligations were
eventually forgotten? Matt. 23:23, 25-28.

    NoTE.—"The Pharisees were very exact in tithing garden herbs, such as
mint, anise, and rue; this cost them little, and it gave them a reputation for
exactness and sanctity. At the same time their useless restrictions oppressed
the people and destroyed respect for the sacred system of God's own appoint-
ing. They occupied men's minds with trifling distinctions, and turned their
attention from essential truths."—The Desire of Ages, page 617.
   15. In Christ's day what had become the attitude of the nation
toward the strangers among them? John 4:9; Acts 10:28.

   NoTE.—"The people who had been given every opportunity to under-
stand the truth were without a knowledge of the needs of those around them.
No effort was made to help souls in darkness. The partition wall which
Jewish pride had erected, shut even the disciples from sympathy with the
heathen world. But these barriers were to be broken down."—The Desire of
Ages, page 400.


                      Lesson 4, for April 22, 1950

       Stewardship of Time and Other Talents

    INTRODUCTORY NOTE: "All men have been bought with this infinite price.
By pouring the whole treasury of heaven into this world, by giving us in Christ all
heaven, God has purchased the will, the affections, the mind, the soul of every human
                                        [ 10 ]
being. Whether believers or unbelievers, all men are the Lord's property. All are
called to do service for Him, and for the manner in which they have met this claim,
all will be required to render an account at the great judgment day."—"Christ's Object
Lessons," page 326.

               Our Accountability for the Use of Time
   1. In what words does the psalmist acknowledge accountability
for the use of time? Ps. 90:12.

   NOTE.—"Time is one of the important talents which God has entrusted
to us and for which He will call us to account. A waste of time is a waste
of intellect."—Testimonies, vol. 3, p. 146.
   2. Who is the giver of time and opportunity for service? Ps.
91:16; 21:4.
                         Recognition of Holy Time
  3. What recognition of His ownership of our time does the
Lord require? Ex. 20:8-10.

   NcrrE.—"God reserved to Himself a specified portion of man's time and
of his means, and no man could, without guilt, appropriate either for his
own interests."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pages 525, 526.
  4. When did God set apart a specific day in recognition of His
ownership? Ex. 20:11; Gen. 2:1-3.

   NoTE.—"In Eden, God set up the memorial of His work of creation, in
placing His blessing upon the seventh day. The Sabbath was committed to
Adam, the father and representative of the whole human family. Its
observance was to be an act of grateful acknowledgment, on the part of all
who should dwell upon the earth, that God was their Creator and their
rightful sovereign; that they were the work of His hands, and the subjects
of His authority. Thus the institution was wholly commemorative, and
given to all mankind."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 48.
   5. What special significance is attached to the faithful observ-
ance of the Sabbath? Ex. 31:13-17.

  6. What blessings are promised to those who with all their
hearts observe the Sabbath? Isa. 58:13, 14.

pare Prov. 22:29.

  8. What lesson in stewardship did Christ teach His friends in
Bethany? Luke 10:38-42.

    NOTE.—"Life is too solemn to be absorbed in temporal and earthly mat-.
ters, in a treadmill of care and anxiety for the things that are but an atom
in comparison with the things of eternal interest. Yet God has called us to
serve Him in the temporal affairs of life. Diligence in this work is as much
a part of true religion as is devotion."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 343.

   9. What are Christians admonished to do? Eph. 5:16.

                     Service With All the Heart
  10. By what parable did Christ teach our accountability for
every mental and spiritual gift? Matt. 25:14, 15.

   NOTE. "The talents that Christ entrusts to His church represent espe-
cially the gifts and blessings imparted by the Holy Spirit. . . . The special
gifts of the Spirit are not the only talents represented in the parable. It
includes all gifts and endowments, whether original or acquired, natural or
spiritual. All are to be employed in Christ's service."—Christ's Object Les-
sons, pages 327, 328.

  11. What course did these servants pursue? What accounting
was made on their Lord's return? Matt. 25:16-30.

    NOTE.—"We shall individually be held responsible for doing one jot less
than we have ability to do. The Lord measures with exactness every pos-
sibility for service. The unused capabilities are as much brought into account
as are those that are improved. For all that we might become through the
right use of our talents God holds us responsible."—Christ's Object Lessons,
page 363.

Mark 12:30.

   13. By what service will the loyalty of God's true children be

                       Lesson 5, for April 29, 1950

           The Stewardship of Physical Health
    MEMORY VERSE: "Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do,
do all to the glory of God." 1 Cor. 10:31.
   STUDY HELPS: S. A. Wellman, "Your Stewardship and Mine," chapter 5;
"Counsels on Stewardship," pages 121, 122.
    INTRODUCTORY NOTE: "Through the agencies of nature, God is working,
day by day, hour by hour, moment by moment, to keep us alive, to build up and restore
us."—"The Ministry of Healing," page 112.
    "As the foundation principle of all education in these lines, the youth should be
taught that the laws of nature are the laws of God,—as truly divine as are the precepts
of the Decalogue. The laws that govern our physical organism, God has written
upon every nerve, muscle, and fiber of the body. Every careless or willful violation of
these laws is a sin against our Creator."—"Education," pages 196, 197.

   4. Questions 10-12.                             7. Review.

            God's Provision for the Health of His People
   1. With what does the apostle John connect physical well-
being? 3 John 2.

   NoTE.—"The Saviour in His miracles revealed the power that is con-
tinually at work in man's behalf, to sustain and to heal him. . . . When any
part of the body sustains injury, a healing process is at once begun; nature's
agencies are set at work to restore soundness. But the power working
through these agencies is the power of God. All life-giving power is from
Him. When one recovers from disease, it is God who restores him."—The
Ministry of Healing, pages 112, 113.
   2. What did God promise Israel if they served Him faithfully?
Ex. 15:26; 23:25.

    NOTE.—Exodus 15:26 includes one of the ten "Jehovah titles," in which
the name Jehovah is joined to some other great word of assurance. Here it
is "Jehovah Ropheka"—"Jehovah that healeth thee." How preciously
connected with this is what is said of Jesus: "Himself took our infirmities,
and bare our sicknesses." Matt. 8:17.
   3. What provision did God make for the protection of ancient
Israel against the physical evils of surrounding nations, and to pre-
serve their health?

    ANswEa: Israel was given a code of sanitation and hygiene which has
                                          [ 13 ]
been a model to succeeding generations. (See Leviticus, chapters 11-15, 17;
also The Ministry of Healing, pages 277-286.)
  4. What special blessing was bestowed upon Israel as they left
Egypt? Ps. 105:37.

    NorE.—"Had the Israelites obeyed the instructions they received, and
profited by their advantages, they would have been the world's object lesson
of health and prosperity. If as a people they had lived according to God's
plan, they would have been preserved from the diseases that afflicted other
nations. Above any other people they would have possessed physical
strength, and vigor of intellect. They would have been the mightiest nation
on the earth."—The Ministry of Healing, page 283.
   5. What blessed experience is coupled with the forgiveness of
sin? Ps. 103:3-5.

  6. While Christ was personally among men, what service did
He perform for the sick? Matt. 4:23.

                      A Dwelling Place for God

   7. Whose dwelling place are we? What are we, therefore, urged
to do? 1 Cor. 6:19, 20.

  8. How will God recompense those who defile the temple of
God? 1 Cor. 3:17.

  9. What outstanding example of loyalty to the principles of
health and temperance is recorded in the. Scriptures? Dan. 1:8-16.

                       Striving for the Mastery
  10. From the rigid training of contestants in ancient games,
what lesson does the apostle Paul draw? 1 Cor. 9:24-27. •

   NorE.—"The contests were governed by strict regulations, from which
there was no appeal. Those who desired their names entered as competitors
for the prize, had first to undergo a severe preparatory training. Harmful
indulgence of appetite, or any other gratification that would lower mental or
physical vigor, was strictly forbidden. . • .
   "How much more important that the Christian, whose eternal inter-
ests are at stake, bring appetite and passion under subjection to reason and
the will of God! Never must he allow his attention to be diverted by amuse-
ments, luxuries, or ease. All his habits and passions must be brought under
the strictest discipline. Reason, enlightened by the teachings of God's word
and guided by His Spirit, must hold the reins of control."—Acts of the
Apostles, pages 309-311.
                                      C 14 ]
   11. How much does true temperance include?

    ANSWER: Diet : Eccl. 10:17.
    NorE.—"Those foods •should be chosen that best supply the elements
needed for building up the body. In this choice, appetite is not a safe
guide. Through wrong habits of eating, the appetite has become perverted.
Often it demands food that impairs health and causes weakness instead of
strength. We cannot safely be guided by the customs of society. The disease
and suffering that everywhere prevail are largely due to popular errors in
regard to diet."—The Ministry of Healing, page 295. Read also pages 295-310.
    Pure Water:
    NOTE.—"In health and in sickness, pure water is one of heaven's choicest
blessings. Its proper use promotes health. It is the beverage which God
provided to quench the thirst of animals and man. Drunk freely, it helps to
supply the necessities of the system, and assists nature to resist disease."—
The Ministry of Healing, page 237.
    Fresh Air:
    NOTE.—"In order to have good blood, we must breathe well. Full, deep
inspirations of pure air, which fill the lungs with oxygen, purify the blood.
They impart to it a bright color, and send it, a life-giving current, to every
part of the body. A good respiration soothes the nerves; it stimulates the
appetite, and renders digestion more perfect ; and it induces sound, refreshing
sleep."—The Ministry of Healing, page 272.
    Rest: Mark 6:31.
    NOTE.—"Some make themselves sick by overwork. For these, rest, free-
dom from care, and a spare diet, are essential to restoration of health."—The
Ministry of Healing, page 236.
    Exercise: Eccl. 5:12.
    NorE.—"Proper periods of sleep and rest and an abundance of physical
exercise are essential to health of body and mind."—Gospel Workers, page 423.
    Dress: 1 Peter 3:3,4.
    NOTE.—Our clothing "should be chosen for durability rather than display.
It should provide warmth and proper protection. . . . In all respects the
dress should be healthful."—The Ministry of Healing, page 288. Also read
pages 287-294.
    Mental Peace: Prov. 17:22; Matt. 11:28; John 14:27.
    NorE.—"Courage, hope, faith, sympathy, love, promote health and pro-
long life. A contented mind, a cheerful spirit, is health to the body and
strength to the soul."—The Ministry of Healing, page 241.
   12. What, therefore, are all Christians exhorted to do? 1 Cor.
10:31; Rom. 12:1.

                         Lesson 6, for May 6, 1950

                     Stewardship in the Home
    MEMORY VERSE: "Therefore also I have lent him to the Lord; as long as
he liveth he shall be lent to the Lord. And he worshiped the Lord there." 1 Sam. 1:28.
    STUDY HELP: S. A. Wellman, "Your Stewardship and Mine," chapter 6.
    INTRODUCTORY NOTE: "Above any other agency, service for Christ's sake
in the little things of everyday experience has power to mold the character and to direct
the life into lines of unselfish ministry. To awaken this spirit, to encourage, and
rightly to direct it, is the parent's and the teacher's work. No more important work
could be committed to them. The spirit of ministry is the spirit of heaven, and with
every effort to develop and encourage it angels will co-operate."—"The Ministry of
Healing," page 401.
    "Children are the heritage of the Lord, and we are answerable to Him for our
management of His property."—"Christ's Object Lessons," page 195.
                          DAILY STUDY ASSIGNMENT
   1. General survey of the lesson.     5. "Your Stewardship and Mine," first
   2. Questions 1-3.                         half of chapter 6.
   3. Questions 4-9.                    6. "Your Stewardship and Mine," sec-
   4. Questions 10-13.                       and half of chapter 6.
                                        7. Review.

                        A Home Where God Dwells
   1. How did God provide companionship for man? Gen. 2:18,
21-24.

  2. What picture of a happy home is drawn by the psalmist? Ps.
128:2, 3, 6.

   NoTE.—Under divine inspiration the psalmist draws a delightful picture
of a peaceful, godly home. In such a home love for God and for one another
dominate the scene. In these homes peace dwells, and the happy influence
of the home is felt in the entire community. Under the direction of the
Holy Spirit this kind of home builds up the kingdom of heaven.
    3. What are our children said to be? Ps. 127:3; Gen. 33:5.

    NOTE.—"Children area heritage from the Lord, and they are to be
trained for His service. This is the work that rests upon parents and teachers
with solemn, sacred force, which they cannot evade or ignore. To neglect
this work marks them as unfaithful servants; but there is a reward when the
seed of truth is early sown in the heart and carefully tended."—Counsels to
Teachers, pages 143, 144.

                           Training Our Children
   4. How does the apostle Paul instruct parents to bring up their
children? Eph. 6:4.
                                         [ 16 ]
    NOTE.—"The law of God is to be kept before the minds of the children
as the great moral standard. When they rise up, and when they sit down,
when they go out, and when they come in, this law is to be taught them as
the great rule of life, and its principles are to be interwoven with all their
experience. They are to be taught to be honest, truthful, temperate, economi- •
cal, and industrious, and to love God with the whole heart. This is bringing
them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. This is setting their
feet in the path of duty and safety."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 329.
   5. What was God's command to ancient Israel concerning the
training of the family? Deut. 6:6, 7.

   6. What results will follow proper early training? Prov. 22:6.

   NOTE. "The training that Solomon enjoins is to direct, educate, develop.
But in order for parents to do this work, they must themselves understand
the 'way' the child should go. It is impossible for parents to give their chil-
dren proper training unless they first give themselves to God, learning of
the Great Teacher lessons of obedience to His will."—Counsels to Teachers,
page 108.

   7. What example of careful instruction does Paul cite? 2 Tim.
3:15.

   NOTE.—"God had commanded the Hebrews to teach their children His
requirements, and to make them acquainted with all His dealings with their
fathers. This was one of the special duties of every parent,—one that was
not to be delegated to another. . . . Such was the training of Moses. . . .
Such, too, was the early life of Christ at Nazareth; such the training by
which the child Timothy learned from the lips of his 'grandmother Lois, and
his mother Eunice,' the truths of Holy Writ."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
page 592.

                      Service Is Good for Youth

   8. What is said to be good for youth? Lam. 3:27.

   NorE.—A sense of responsibility, the bearing of burdens, should early be
taught to every child. Careful plans should be laid for him to perform
specific duties about the home, the farm, and the garden, and that their
execution is performed with care and exactness.
   9. What are youth admonished to do? Eccl. 12:1.

   NOTE.—We are definitely instructed concerning what our children should
be taught to do in relation to their Creator. We read:
   "Teach your children that God has a claim upon all they possess, a claim
that nothing can ever cancel; whatever they have is theirs only in trust as a
test of their obedience. Inspire them with ambition to gain stars for their
crown by winning many souls from sin to righteousness. Money is a needed
                                     [ 17 ]
treasure; let it not be lavished upon those who do not need it. Someone
needs your willing gifts."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 451.
   10. What Biblical example is given of a negligent parent, and
the result of a lack of discipline? 1 Sam. 2:12-17, 34; 3:13.

   NoTE.—"There is no greater curse upon households than to allow the
youth to have their own way. When parents regard every wish of their
children, and indulge them in what they know is not for their good, the
children soon lose all respect for their parents, all regard for the authority
of God or man, and are led captive at the will of Satan. The influence of
an ill-regulated family is widespread, and disastrous to all society. It accu-
mulates in a tide of evil that affects families, communities, and governments."
—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 579.
   11. What early examples of right child training are given in
the New Testament? Luke 1:80; 2:40, 49-52.

   12. What should the father make known to his children? Isa.
38:19, last part.

   13. What precious experience is promised to parents and chil-
dren in the last days? For what should parents be preparing their
children? Mal. 4:5, 6.

    NOTE.—"Every son and daughter of God is called to be a missionary; we
are called to the service of God and our fellow men; and to fit us for this
service should be the object of our education.
   "This object should ever be kept in view by Christian parents and teach-
ers. We know not in what line our children may serve. They may spend
their lives within the circle of the home; they may engage in life's common
vocations, or go as teachers of the gospel to heathen lands; but all are alike
called to be missionaries for God, ministers of mercy to the world."—The
Ministry of Healing, page 395.


                       Lesson 7, for May 13, 1950

            Jesus, Our Example in Stewardship
    MEMORY VERSE: "Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto,
but to minister, and to give His life a ransom for many." Matt. 20:28.
    STUDY HELPS: S. A. Wellman, "Your Stewardship and Mine," chapter 7;
"Counsels on Stewardship," pages 25-28.
    INTRODUCTORY NOTE: "As this wonderful, priceless Gift was bestowed, the
whole heavenly universe was mightily stirred in an effort to understand God's unfath-
omable love, stirred to awaken in human hearts a gratitude proportionate to the value
of the Gift. Shall we, for whom Christ has given His life, halt between two opinions?
Shall we return to God only a mite of the capabilities and powers lent us by Him?
How can we do this while we know that He who was Commander of all heaven laid
                                        [ 18 ]
aside His royal robe and kingly crown, and, realizing the helplessness of the fallen race,
came to this earth in human nature to make it possible for us to unite our humanity
to His divinity? He became poor that we might come into possession of the heavenly
treasure, 'a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.' 2 Cor. 4:17. To rescue
us He descended from one humiliation to another until He, the divine-human, suffering
Christ, was uplifted on the cross to draw all men to Himself. The Son of God could
not have shown greater condescension than He did; He could hot have stooped
lower."—"Testimonies," vol. 7, p. 29.

                          DAILY STUDY ASSIGNMENT

  1. What impelled God to send His Son into the world to save
men? John 3:16; 1 John 4:9.

   NoTE.—"It was a costly sacrifice that the Lord of heaven made. Divine
benevolence was stirred to its unfathomable depths; it was impossible for
God to give more."—Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 59, 60.
   2. In what spirit did Christ enter upon the great task entrusted
to Him? Phil. 2:6-8.

    NoTE.—The Revised Standard Version of the New Testament gives the
following translation of these verses: "Who, though He was in the form of
God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied
Himself, taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men.
And being found in human form He humbled Himself and became obedient
unto death, even death on a cross."
  3. How completely did He identify Himself with the human
family? Heb. 2:9, 10, 14, 16.

                         Christ's Example in Service
  4. What change came into Christ's life when He came into this
world? 2 Cor. 8:9.

   NOTE.—"You know the height from which He stooped, the depth of
humiliation to which He descended. His feet entered upon the path of
sacrifice, and turned not aside until He had given His life. There was no
rest for Him between the throne in heaven and the cross. His love for man
led Him to welcome every indignity, and suffer every abuse."---The Ministry
of Healing, page 501.
    5. What did Christ delight to do? Ps. 40:8.
                                           119 ]
  6. What did Christ while on earth seek to do for men? What
made this possible? Acts 10:38.
    NOTE.—"Our Lord Jesus Christ came to this world as the unwearied
servant of man's necessity. He 'took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses,'
that He might minister to every need of humanity. . . . It was His mission
to bring to men complete restoration; He came to give them health and peace
and perfection of character."—The Ministry of Healing, page 17.
  7. What was His message to Israel as He began His ministry?
As His disciples went out, what message were they to carry? What
work were they to do? Matt. 4:17; 10:7, 8.

   8. How are we to relate ourselves to the spirit of sacrifice and
service? John 13:15-17; Matt. 19:21; James 1:27.

    NorE.—"His [Christ's] whole life was under a law of service. He served
all, ministered to all. Thus He lived the law of God, and by His example
showed how we are to obey it."—The Desire of Ages, page 649.

                          To Seek and to Save
  9. For what purpose did Christ say He came into the world?
Matt. 20:28.

    NOTE.—"Christ gave no stinted service. He did not measure His work
by hours. His time, His heart, His soul and strength, were given to labor
for the benefit of humanity. Through weary days He toiled, and through
long nights He bent in prayer for grace and endurance that He might do
a larger work. . . . To His workers He says, 'I have given you an example,
that ye should do as I have done.'"—The Ministry of Healing, page 500.
   10. Whose will did Jesus carry out in His ministry and sacri-
fice? John 6:38.

   11. What was Christ's expressed attitude as He drew near the
time of the supreme sacrifice? John 12:27; Matt. 26:39.

   12. How was the price of Calvary portrayed in Isaiah's proph-
ecy? Isa.53:3-9.

  13. What hope sustained Him in making this great sacrifice for
man? Isa. 53:11. Compare Heb. 12:2.

   14. What personal lessons should His followers learn from His
example? 1 Peter 2:21.
                                    [ 20 ]
    NOTE.—"Through trial and persecution the glory—the character—of God
is revealed in His chosen ones. The believers in Christ, hated and persecuted
by the world, are educated and disciplined in the school of Christ. On earth
they walk in narrow paths; they are purified in the furnace of affliction.
They follow Christ through sore conflicts; they endure self-denial, and
experience bitter disappointments; but thus they learn the guilt and woe of
sin, and they look upon it with abhorrence. Being partakers of Christ's
sufferings, they can look beyond the gloom to the glory, saying, 'I teckon
that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with
the glory which shall be revealed in us.' "—The Acts of the Apostles, pages
576,577.


                          Lesson 8, for May 20, 1950

      The Steward's Responsibility to the World
    MEMORY VERSE:. "I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles,, that thou
mayest be My salvation unto the end of the earth." Isa. 49:6, last part.
    STUDY HELP: S. A. Wellman, "Your Stewardship and Mine," chapter 8.
    INTRODUCTORY NOTE: "Men are in peril. Multitudes are perishing. But
how few of the professed followers of Christ are burdened for these souls. The destiny
of a world hangs in the balance; but this hardly moves even those who claim to believe
the most far-reaching truth ever given to mortals. . . . With the whole world before
them in need of the gospel, professed Christians congregate together where they them-
selves can enjoy gospel privileges. They do not feel the necessity of occupying new
territory, carrying the message of salvation into regions beyond. They refuse to fulfill
Christ's commission, 'Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every crea-
ture.' Are they less guilty than was the Jewish church?"—"Christ's Object Lessons,"
page 303.

                               A World in Darkness

  1. How does the gospel prophet describe the condition of the
world? Isa. 60:2, first part.

    2. How is every soul out of Christ described? Eph. 2:12.

    NoTE.—Every soul that has found the Saviour and has had his life
transformed by His power, came out of dense spiritual darkness. Regardless
of the nationality, race, or privileges of the individual, in spite of educational
advantages, or positions of preferment in this world, no man has the light
that shines brighter and brighter unto the perfect day until he has entered
into the presence of Christ and found Him the Saviour of his soul. Then
                                         [21 ]
there is shed abroad in his heart a light and joy and hope not to be found
elsewhere. Until that hour it is darkness such as Paul describes—"Having
no hope, and without God in the world." Eph. 2:12.

                          Given a World Task

   3.. What is Christ's express desire that His followers should do
for the sin-darkened world? Matt. 5:14-16.

   NOTE.—"What is light? It is piety, goodness, truth, mercy, love; it is
the revealing of the truth in the character and life."—Review and Herald,
March 24, 1891, quoted in Christian Service, page 21.
  4. What does Paul say the Lord has commanded the apostles to
do? Acts 13:47.

   5. What command did Jesus give His disciples just before His
ascension? What power would accompany them in their labors?
Matt. 28:18-20.

   6. Where was their witness to begin? To what places would it
extend? Acts 1:8.

    NOTE.—"To you, My disciples, I [Jesus] commit this message of mercy.
It is to be given to Israel first, and then to all nations, tongues, and peoples.
It is to be given to Jews and Gentiles. All who believe are to be gathered
into one church. Through the gift of the Holy Spirit the disciples were to
receive a marvelous power. Their testimony was to be confirmed by signs
and wonders. Miracles would be wrought, not only by the apostles, but
by those who received their message."—The Desire of Ages, page 821.
   7, What results followed their witness? Acts 2:41; 4:4.

                            Not an Easy Task

   8. What could the disciples expect as a part of their experience
of ministry? Matt. 10:16-24.

    NOTE.—"The Saviour's eye penetrates the future; He beholds the broader
fields in which, after His death, the disciples are to be witnesses for Him.
His prophetic glance takes in the experience of His servants through all
the ages till He shall come the second time. . . . They are to contend with
supernatural forces, but they are assured of supernatural help. All the intel-
ligences of heaven are in this army. And more than angels are in the ranks.
The Holy Spirit, the representative of the Captain of the Lord's host, comes
down to direct the battle. Our infirmities may be many, our sins and mis-
takes grievous; but the grace of God is for all who seek it with contrition. The
power of Omnipotence is enlisted in behalf of those who trust in God."—
The Desire of Ages, page 352.
                                    [22 ]
   9. Because the disciples failed to go beyond their national sur-
roundings, what did God permit to come upon the church? What
results followed? Acts 8:1, 4.

   10. To what special work was Paul called after his conversion?
Through what experiences would he be called upon to pass? Acts
9:15, 16; 26:16-21.

    NoTE.—Paul was called to no easy task. The succeeding years were filled
with arduous labors, suffering, and privation, which ended only with his
death. Of those experiences we read, "Amidst the constant storm of opposi-
tion, the clamor of enemies, and the desertion of friends, the intrepid apostle
almost lost heart. But he looked back to Calvary, and with new ardor
pressed on to spread the knowledge of the Crucified. He was but treading
the bloodstained path that Christ had trodden before him. He sought no
discharge from the warfare till he should lay off his armor at the feet of
his Redeemer."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 297.
   11. At the close of these arduous and trying years of faithful
service what witness could the apostle give? 2 Tim. 4:6-8.

    NOTE.—This testimony of the aged, war-worn apostle is presented in
these words: "Well-nigh a score of centuries have passed since Paul the aged
poured out his blood as a witness for the word of God and the testimony of
Jesus Christ. No faithful hand recorded for the generations to come the
last scenes in the life of this holy man; but Inspiration has preserved for us
his dying testimony. Like a trumpet peal his voice has rung out through
all the ages since, nerving with his own courage thousands of witnesses for
Christ, and wakening in thousands of sorrow-stricken hearts the echo of his
own triumphant joy."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 513.
   12. What precious prophetic promises are made to all faithful
servants of the Master? Isa. 43:5-7; 49:6, 12.


                        Lesson 9, for May 27, 1950

              Our Stewardship in Tithe Paying.
    MEMORY VERSE: "Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may
be meat in Mine house, and prove Me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will
not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not
be room enough to receive it." Mal. 3:10.
    STUDY HELPS: S. A. Wellman, "Your Stewardship and Mine," chapter 9;
"Counsels on Stewardship," pages 65-107.
    INTRODUCTORY NOTE: "We are to praise God by tangible service, by doing
all in our power to advance the glory of His name. God imparts His gifts to us that
we also may give, and thus make known His character to the world. Under the Jewish
economy, gifts and offerings formed an essential part of God's worship. The Israelites
were taught to devote a tithe of all their income to the service of the sanctuary. Besides
                                            [ 23 ]
this they were to bring sin offerings, freewill gifts, and offerings of gratitude. These
were the means for supporting the ministry of the gospel for that time. God expects
no less from us than He expected from His people anciently. The great work for the
salvation of souls must be carried forward. In the tithe, with gifts and offerings, He
has made provision for this work. Thus He intends that the ministry of the gospel
shall be sustained. . . . All are to be devoted to the sending of the gospel unto the
uttermost parts of the earth."—"Christ's Object Lessons," page 300.           4

                    Acknowledging God's Ownership
   1. What have we already learned concerning divine ownership?
Ps. 24:1, 2; 50:10-12; Haggai 2:8.

   2. In what manner did Abraham acknowledge God as "possessor
of heaven and earth"? Gen. 14:17-20.

   3. In what words did Jacob, in his vow to the Lord, include
faithfulness in tithing? Gen. 28:20-22.

   4. In the code of laws given to Israel, what instruction was given
them concerning faithfulness in tithing? Lev. 27:30-32; Deut. 14:22.

    NOTE.—"The tithing system did not originate with the Hebrews. From
the earliest times the Lord claimed a tithe as His; and this claim was
recognized and honored. Abraham paid tithe to Melchizedek, the priest of
the most high God. Jacob, when at Bethel, an exile and a wanderer, promised
the Lord, 'Of all that Thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto
Thee.' As the Israelites were about to be established as a nation, the law
of tithing was reaffirmed, as one of the divinely ordained statutes upon
obedience to which their prosperity depended."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
page 525.
   5. After the deliverance of Israel from Egypt, what specific
instruction was given concerning tithing? Lev. 27:30.

    NOTE.—"In the Hebrew economy, one tenth of the income of the people
was set apart to support the public worship of God. Thus Moses declared
to Israel: 'All the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of
the fruit of the tree, is the Lord's; it is holy unto the Lord.'    concerning
the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, . . . the tenth shall be holy unto the
Lord.' . . .
                                        1 24]
   "The system of tithes and offerings was intended to impress the minds
of men with a great truth,—that God is the source of every blessing to His
creatures, and that to Him man's gratitude is due for the good gifts of His
providence."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 525.

            The Divine Plan for the Support of Those
               Who Minister About Holy Things
   6. For what purpose was the tithe to be used? Num. 18:21, 24.

   7. In what words does the apostle Paul indicate the responsibil-
ity of the believers to support those who minister to them in the
gospel? 1 Cor. 9:7-14.

    NOTE.—Although the priests in the sanctuary ceased their work of the
priesthood in the sanctuary with the cessation of the services on earth, those
whom God has ordained as His ministers are their spiritual successors today.
The same obligations for their support rest upon the Christian church. The
provisions for this support are "even so," or identical with the original
tithing system.
   8. In what words did Christ enjoin the duty of tithing? Matt.
23:23.

   NoTE.—In this scripture Christ approves the principle of tithing. Though.
He condemns dependence for salvation on strictness in tithing, though He
emphasizes that disloyalty in spiritual and moral obligations cannot be
covered by the payment of tithes and offerings, yet He commends the
payment of a full tithe.

    The Results of Wrong and Right Attitudes to Tithing
  9. What was the result when Israel failed to bring in their tithe
and offerings? Neh. 13:10.

     NoTE.—When God's children fail to return to God His own and do not
observe the instruction concerning the prescribed offerings, the ministry of
the word suffers. Workers turn to their ordinary pursuits. The teaching
of the Scriptures is neglected, and God's cause on earth languishes and stands
still.
   10. How was the situation remedied in Nehemiah's day? What
other requirements of God are usually neglected when the tithe
and offerings are withheld? Neh. 13:11, 12, 15-18.

   NoTE.—As a result of their contact with the idolatrous nations among
which they had dwelt and with whom they had to some extent intermingled,
the temple service and its support had been neglected, and the people had
                                   E25 ]
grown careless in their observance of the Sabbath. These two signs—the
tithe, an acknowledgment of God's ownership of all things, and the Sabbath,
the sign of His control of our time and of His sanctifying power upon His
people—had been relegated into partial oblivion. Satan seeks unceasingly
to veil all that will help God's children to remember their Creator; and he
emphasizes those things which will eclipse Christ, with His saving grace
and power.
  11. Of what are God's children accused by the prophet Malachi?
What does God invite them to do? With what results? Mal. 3:8-12.

   NorE.—"As the Giver of every blessing, God claims a certain portion
of all we possess. This is His provision to sustain the preaching of the
gospel. And by making this return to God, we are to show our appreciation
of His gifts. But if we withhold from Him that which is His own, how can
we claim His blessing? If we are unfaithful stewards of earthly things, how
can we expect Him to entrust us with the things of heaven? It may be that
here is the secret of unanswered prayer."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 144.

                   Modern Israel's Responsibility
  12. What enormous task has been laid upon Christ's church?
Matt. 28:18-20; Rev. 14:6.

   NOTE.—See Introductory Note. This world-wide task calls for corre-
sponding faithfulness in tithes and offerings.
    13. What would result if all the children of God paid a faithful
tithe?

    ANSWER: "If our churches will take their stand upon the Lord's word
and be faithful in paying their tithe into His treasury, more laborers will
be encouraged to take up ministerial work. More men would give themselves
to the ministry were they not told of the depleted treasury. There should
be an abundant supply in the Lord's treasury, and there would be if selfish
hearts and hands had not withheld the tithes or made use of them to support
other lines of work."—Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 249.
  14. In the message of the first angel of Revelation 14, how does
God call upon the remnant to recognize His ownership of the
world? Rev. 14:7.

    NorE.—The call of this message is an acknowledgment of the Creator.
It calls upon men to give Him glory, and to fear Him, in preparation-for
the hour of judgment. This will lead to obedience, to fullness of loyalty and
devotion. It will cause everyone that accepts the message to acknowledge
God's ownership of all His just claim upon our money, our time, our talents,
our bodily health and strength, and of our children, for He made them. In
devoting them to the work of making Him known as the Creator, we are
but returning to Him His own.

                        Lesson 10, for June 3, 1950

          Our Stewardship in Freewill Offerings
    MEMORY VERSE: "For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much
required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more."
Luke 12:48, last part.
    STUDY HELP: S. A. Wellman, "Your Stewardship and Mine," chapter 10;
"Counsels on Stewardship," pages 198-206.
    INTRODUCTORY NOTE: "All who have borne with Jesus the cross of sacri-
fice will be sharers with Him of His glory. It was the joy of Christ in His humiliation
and pain that His disciples should be glorified with Him. They are the fruit of His
self-sacrifice. The outworking in them of His own character and spirit is His reward,
and will be His joy throughout eternity. This joy they share with Him as the fruit
of their labor and sacrifice is seen in other hearts and lives. They are workers together
with Christ, and the Father will honor them as He honors His Son."—"The Desire of
Ages," page 624.

                            Early Tests of Loyalty
  1. What test did the Lord make to prove the loyalty of Adam and
Eve? Gen. 2:16,17; 3:3.

    NOTE.—"At the very beginning of man's existence a check was placed
upon the desire for self-indulgence, the fatal passion that lay at the founda-
tion of Satan's fall. The tree of knowledge, which stood near the tree of life
in the midst of the garden, was to be a test of the obedience, faith, and love
of our first parents. While permitted to eat freely of every other tree, they
were forbidden to taste of this, on pain of death. They were also to be
exposed to the temptations of Satan; but if they endured the trial, they
would finally be placed beyond His power, to enjoy perpetual favor with
God."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pages 48, 49.
   2. How did God test and try Joseph in order to fit him for the
great responsibilities to which he was called? Gen. 37:28; 39:20;
41:41-45.

   NOTE.—Of Joseph's trials and afflictions we are told: "God was prepar-
ing him, in the school of affliction, for greater usefulness, and he did not
refuse the needful discipline."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 218. He was
tested, tried, refined, his life purified, that he might render the greater
service for God. Every trial that we are called upon to endure, every
sacrifice that we are called upon to make, is but the preparatory school for
a wider field of service.
                                          [ 27 ]
   3. What great decision was Moses called upon to make? How
did he respond? Heb. 11:23-26.

   4. To the remnant church what tremendous task has been
assigned? Matt. 24:14.
                Giving the Gospel Requires Our All
   5. What call to consecration did Jesus make to His disciples in
His day? Luke 5:10, 11; 18:22, 23.

   6. How did the early church put into practice this principle in
spreading the gospel? Acts 4:33-37.

    Nora.—"This liberality on the part of the believers was the result of the
outpouring of the Spirit. The converts to the gospel were 'of one, heart and
of one soul.' One common interest controlled them,—the success of the
mission entrusted to them; and covetousness had no place in their lives.
Their love for their brethren and the cause they had espoused, was greater
than their love of money and possessions. Their works testified that they
accounted the souls of men of higher value than earthly wealth."—The Acts
of the Apostles, pages 70, 71.
  7. What is one of the outstanding dangers to the Christian? What
admonition does Christ give? Luke 12:15, 31-34.

   NOTE.—"We ought now to be heeding the injunction of our Saviour: 'Sell
that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a
treasure in the heavens that faileth not.' It is now that our brethren should
be cutting down their possessions instead of increasing them. We are about
to move to a better country, even a heavenly. Then let us not be dwellers
upon the earth, but be getting things into as compact a compass as possible.
   "The time is coming when we cannot sell at any price. The decree will
soon go forth prohibiting men to buy or sell of any man save him that hath
the mark of the beast."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 152.
   8. What is it the Father's pleasure to do for the faithful? Luke
12:32.
                           Bearing His Cross
   9. What test of true discipleship does Christ place before His
servants? Luke 14:26, 27.

   10. What two illustrations of counting the cost are given? Luke
14:28-32.
   NorE.—The Saviour cannot accept partial obedience. A love for earthly
relatives that is more than our love for Christ makes us unworthy of Him.
                                    [ 28 J
Christ must come first. We must count the cost when choosing His service.
If we choose Him, all that we have must go with the choice. The promise
to those who forsake all to follow Christ is: "He shall receive an hundred-
fold now in this time, houses, _and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and
children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal
life." Mark 10:30. We need to count the cost, but it is worth all the toil
and sacrifice we shall be called upon to make to be able to follow our Lord.
   11. What conclusion does the Saviour draw? Luke 14:33.

                       Much Will Be Required
   12. What basic principle does God expect us to follow in giving
for the extension of His cause? Luke 12:48; Matt. 10:8, last clause.
   NoTE.—"As our blessings and privileges are increased,—above all, as we
have before us the unparalleled sacrifice of the glorious Son of God,—should
not our gratitude find expression in more abundant gifts to extend to others
the message of salvation? The work of the gospel, as it widens, requires
greater provision to sustain it than was called for anciently; and this makes
the law of tithe and offerings of even more urgent necessity now than under
the Hebrew economy."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pages 528, 529.
   13. What is the divine standard for individual giving? 1 Cor.
16:2.
   14. To prevent our forgetting the world's need of Christ, what
are we urged to do? John 4:35; Luke 10:2.

  15. What vision of need did Paul see and what was his response?
Acts 16:9, 10.

   Nora.—Paul's experience is an example for us. "From all countries the
Macedonian cry is sounding: 'Come over, . . . and help us.' God has
opened fields before us, and if human agencies would but co-operate with
divine agencies, many, many souls would be won to the truth. But the
Lord's professing people have been sleeping over their allotted work, and in
many places it remains comparatively untouched."—Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 46.
   "Our church members should feel a deep interest in home and foreign
missions. Great blessings will come to them as they make self-sacrificing
efforts to plant the standard of truth in new territory."—Ibid., page 49.
   "If there was ever a time when sacrifices should be made, it is now. Those
who have money should understand that now is the time to use it for God."
—Ibid., vol. 6. p. 450.

    MEMORY VERSE: "For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according
to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not." 2 Cor. 8:12.
    STUDY HELPS: S. A. Wellman, "Your Stewardship and Mine," chapter 11;
"Counsels on Stewardship," pages 15, 16.
    INTRODUCTORY NOTE: "However short our service or humble our work,
if in simple faith we follow Christ, we shall not be disappointed of the reward. That
which even the greatest and wisest cannot earn, the weakest and most humble may
receive. Heaven's golden gate opens not to the self-exalted. It is not lifted up to the
proud in spirit. But the everlasting portals will open wide to the trembling touch
of a little child. Blessed will be the recompense of grace to those who have wrought
for God in the simplicity of faith and love."—"Christ's Object Lessons," page 404.

                 Controlling Principles of Stewardship

   1. What spirit was to actuate those who gave the materials for
building the sanctuary? Ex. 36:5-7; 1 Chron. 29:9.

2. On what basis is our service and sacrifice acceptable to God?
What only commends our service to Him? 2 Cor. 8:1, 2, 12.

   NOTE.—"It is not the length of time we labor, but our willingness and
fidelity in the work, that makes it acceptable to God. In all our service
a full surrender of self is demanded. The smallest duty done in sincerity
and self-forgetfulness, is more pleasing to God than the greatest work when
marred with self-seeking. He looks to see how much of the spirit of Christ
we cherish, and how much of the likeness of Christ our work reveals. He
regards more the love and faithfulness with which we work than the amount
we do."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 402.
  3. How did Jesus recognize this principle in commending the
poor widow? Mark 12:41, 44.

    Nora.—"The Saviour called His disciples to Him, and bade them mark
the widow's poverty. Then His words of commendation fell upon her ear:
`Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow bath cast in more than
they all.' Tears of joy filled her eyes as she felt that her act was understood
and appreciated. . . . Jesus understood her motive. She believed the service
of the temple to be of God's appointment, and she was anxious to do her
utmost to sustain it."—The Desire of Ages, page 615.
                                      C 80 I
  4. In sowing and reaping, what principle controls the results?
How should we give? Whom does God love? 2 Cor. 9:6, 7.

                   Preparing for God's Approval
  5. What instruction was Timothy admonished to give to those
who were blessed with this world's goods? 1 Tim. 6:17, 18.

   6. By following this counsel, for what would they be preparing?
1 Tim. 6:19.

   NOTE.—"God desires us to choose the heavenly in place of the earthly.
He opens before us the possibilities of a heavenly investment. He would
give encouragement to our loftiest aims, security to our choicest treasure.
He declares,'I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man
than the golden wedge of Ophir.' When the riches that moth devours and
rust corrupts shall be swept away, Christ's followers can rejoice in their
heavenly treasure, the riches that are imperishable. . . . Then let your
property go beforehand to heaven. Lay up your treasure beside the throne
of God. Make sure your title to the unsearchable riches of Christ."—Christ's
Object Lessons, pages 374, 375.
   7. For what did Paul commend the Philippians? Of what was
he assured concerning them? Phil. 4:15-19.

                       The Promise of Reward
  8. By what parable did Jesus illustrate His dealings with His
workers? Matt. 20:1.

   9. What reward was promised the first laborers hired? Matt.
20:2.

   10. What promise did the householder make to those who were
hired at the third, sixth, and ninth hours? Matt. 20:3-5.

   11. Whom did he find standing idle•in the market place at the
eleventh hour? What arrangement did he make with them? Matt.
20:6, 7.

  12. When the time came to pay the laborers, what procedure
was followed? How much did each receive? What complaint was
made? Matt. 20:8-12.

    13. What was the householder's reply? Matt. 20:13-16.
                                    [ 81 ]
    NOTE.—"The first laborers of the parable represent those who, because
of their services, claim preference above others. They take up their work
in a self-gratulatory spirit, and do not bring into it self-denial and sacrifice.
They may have professed to serve God all their lives; they may have been
foremost in enduring hardship, privation, and trial, and they therefore think
themselves entitled to a large reward. They think more of the reward than
of the privilege of being servants of Christ. In their view their labors and
sacrifices entitle them to receive honor above others, and because this claim
is not recognized, they are off ended."—Christ's Object Lessons, pages 399, 400.

                     When the King Claims His Own

   14. What reward will be bestowed on those who have loyally
and willingly consecrated their all to Christ's service? Rom. 2:6, 7;
Rev. 22:12.

   NOTE.—"There are many who have given themselves to Christ, yet who
see no opportunity of doing a large work or making great sacrifices in His
service. These may find comfort in the thought that it is not necessarily the
martyr's self-surrender which is most acceptable to God; it may not be the
missionary who has daily faced danger and death, that stands highest in
heaven's records. The Christian who is such in his private life, in the daily
surrender of self, in sincerity of purpose and purity of thought, in meekness
under provocation, in faith and piety, in fidelity in that which is least, the
one who in the home life represents the character of Christ,—such a one
may in the sight of God be more precious than even the world-renowned
missionary or martyr."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 403.
  15. To what wonderful partnership did Paul refer in his
appeal to the Corinthian church? 1 Cor. 3:9; 2 Cor. 6:1, first clause.

    NoTE.—God's gift of love and life eternal through redemption; the
gratitude that we must ever owe Him for His blessings bestowed throughout
our mortal existence, should make us grateful, willing partners with Him
in labor and travail for lost humanity. This is the priceless privilege of those
who are "workers together with Him."



                       Lesson 12, for June 17, 1950

            Divinely Endowed for Stewardship
    MEMORY VERSE: "Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowl-
edge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the
fullness of Christ." Eph. 4:13.
    STUDY HELP: S. A. Wellman, "Your Stewardship and Mine,"chapter 12.
    INTRODUCTORY NOTE: "All who consecrate soul, body, and spirit to God
will be constantly receiving a new endowment of physical and mental power. The inex-
haustible supplies of heaven are at their command. Christ gives them the breath of
His own spirit, the life of His own life. The Holy Spirit puts forth its highest energies
                                          [ 32 ]
to work in heart and mind. The grace of God enlarges and multiplies their faculties,
and every perfection of the divine nature comes to their assistance in the work of
saving souls. Through co-operation with Christ they are complete in Him, and in
their human weakness they are enabled to do the deeds of Omnipotence."—"The Desire
of Ages," page 827.

                           DAILY STUDY ASSIGNMENT

                                                 7. Review.

                       God Watches Human Strivings

  1. What struggle is constantly waged in the hearts and lives of
men? Gal. 5:17.

   NorE.—This conflict in the lives of men is pictured in the following quota-
tion: "It is through false theories and traditions that Satan gains his power
over the mind. By directing men to false standards, he misshapes the
character. Through the Scriptures the Holy Spirit speaks to the mind, and
impresses truth upon the heart. Thus He exposes error, and expels it from
the soul. It is by the Spirit of truth, working through the word of God,
that Christ subdues His chosen people to Himself."—The Desire Of Ages,
page 671.
                                            •
    2. What is God's attitude toward the sinner? Eph. 2:4, 5; Rom.
5:8.

   NOTE.—God has always made manifest HiS desire for man's salvation.
His love for man emptied heaven in our behalf, sending His only-begotten
Son to live, to labor, and to die for erring man. He centered the eyes of the
universe on the conflict that was raging between good and evil on this earth.
All His creation awaited the outcome of God's plan for man's redemption
through the sacrifice of His beloved Son. Calvary is the evidence of a love
unsurpassed.
  3. What is our part as God seeks a dwelling place in our hearts?
Rev. 3:20.

   NOTE.—The Saviour "is not repulsed by scorn or turned aside by threat-
ening, but continually seeks the lost ones, saying, 'How shall I give thee up?'
Although His love is driven back by the stubborn heart, He returns to plead
with greater force, 'Behold, I stand at the door, and knock.' "—Christ's
Object Lessons, page 235.

                   His Presence and Power May Be Ours

    4. By what agency does God dwell in the hearts of men? John
14:16-20.
                                        [ 33 ]
   5. What change of heart is wrought by the entrance of the Holy
Spirit? Ezek. 36:26, 27.

    NoTE.—"The Holy Spirit was the highest of all gifts that He could
solicit from His Father for the exaltation of His people. The Spirit was to
be given as a regenerating agent, and without this the sacrifice of Christ
would have been of no avail. The power of evil had been strengthening for
centuries, and the submission of men to this satanic captivity was amazing.
Sin could be resisted and overcome only through the mighty agency of the
Third Person of the Godhead, who would come with no modified energy,
but in the fullness of divine power. It is the Spirit that makes effectual
what has been wrought out by the world's Redeemer. It is by the Spirit that
the heart is made pure. Through the Spirit the believer becomes a partaker
of the divine nature. Christ has given His Spirit as a divine power to over-
come all hereditary and cultivated tendencies to evil, and to impress His
own character upon His church."—The Desire of Ages, page 671.

                              It Is a Mystery
  6. How did Jesus explain to Nicodemus the mystery of the
Spirit's operation in human hearts? John 3:1-8.

   7. How fully will the Holy Spirit take possession of our lives
if we yield to Him? What will He do for us? Eph. 3:16-19.

   NOTE.—The Holy Spirit, admitted to the human heart, brings cleansing
from sin. Spiritual power before unknown will be made available to the one
in whom Christ has come to dwell.
   8. To what experience are the saints ultimately to attain? Eph.
4:12, 13.

    NoTE.—The gifts of the Spirit are given for the purpose of developing
in the church the full stature of Jesus Christ. The church, through the
operation of the Spirit, will measure up to His standard in character, in
service and in sacrifice. The kingdom of God will thus be established, and
His people be made ready for the return of their Lord.

   9. What are we counseled against doing? Eph. 4:30.

   NOTE.—Every sin, every careless act, indifference to duty, or shirking of
responsibility, grieves the Holy Spirit, and, temporarily at least, banishes Him
from our hearts.

                    Empowered to Finish the Task
   10. What promise of power did Jesus give to His church in His
parting message? Acts 1:8.
                                     [ 34]
   NOTE.—"God has committed to us a special work, a work that no other
people can do. He has promised us the aid of His Holy Spirit. The heavenly
current is flowing earthward for the accomplishment of the very work
appointed us. Let not this heavenly current be turned aside by our devia-
tions from the straightforward path marked out by Christ."—Testimonies,
vol. 6, p. 244.
   11. What resulted from the outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon
the apostolic church? Acts 4:8-10, 31, 32; 6:3, 5, 8; 8:1.

     NOTE.—"What was the result of the outpouring of the Spirit on the Day
of Pentecost? The glad tidings of a risen Saviour were carried to the utter-
most parts of the inhabited world. As the disciples proclaimed the message
of redeeming grace, hearts yielded to the power of this message. The church
beheld converts flocking to her from all directions. Backsliders were recon-
verted. Sinners united with believers in seeking the pearl of great price. Some
who had been the bitterest opponents of the gospel became its champions.
. . . Every Christian saw in his brother a revelation of divine love and
benevolence. One interest prevailed; one subject of emulation swallowed
up all others. The ambition of the believers was to reveal the likeness of
Christ's character, and to labor for the enlargement of His kingdom."—The
Acts of the Apostles, page 48.
   12. Of what was the Pentecostal experience a fulfillment? Joel
2:28, 29; Acts 2:16, 17.

   13. What may we expect before the great final ingathering of
earth's harvest? Joel 2:23, last clause.

    NOTE.—"Near the close of earth's harvest, a special bestowal of spiritual
grace is promised to prepare the church for the coming of the•Son of man.
This outpouring of the Spirit is likened to the falling of the latter rain; and
it is for this added power that Christians are to send their petitions to the
Lord of the harvest 'in the time of the latter rain.' . . .
    "Every worker who follows the example of Christ will be prepared to
receive and use the power that God has promised to His church for the
ripening of earth's harvest. Morning by morning, as the heralds of the gospel
kneel before the Lord and renew their vows of consecration to Him, He will
grant them the presence of His spirit, with its reviving, sanctifying power.
As they go forth to the day's duties, they have the assurance that the unseen
agency of the Holy Spirit enables them to be 'laborers together with God.'"
—The Acts of the Apostles, pages 55, 56.
   14. The giving of what urgent invitation will be the keynote of
every believer's life? Rev. 22:17, 20.

   NoTE.—"Everyone who hears is to repeat the invitation. Whatever one's
calling in life, his first interest should be to win souls for Christ. He may not
be able to speak to congregations, but he can work for individuals. . . .
   "The disciples were to begin their work where they were. The hardest and
most unpromising field was not to be passed by. So every one of Christ's.
                                         185 3
 workers is to begin where he is., In our own families may be' souls hungry
 for sympathy, starving for the bread of life. There may be children to be
 trained for Christ. There are heathen at our very doors. Let us do faithfully
 the work that is nearest. Then let our efforts be extended as far as God's
 hand may lead the way."—The Desire of Ages, page 822.
     "The command, 'Go ye into all the world,' is not to be lost sight of. We
 are called upon to lift our eyes to the 'regions beyond.' Christ tears away
 the wall of partition, the dividing prejudice of nationality, and teaches a
 love for all the human family. He lifts men from the narrow circle which
 their selfishness prescribes; He abolishes all territorial lines and artificial
'distinctions of society. He makes no difference between neighbors and
 strangers, friends and enemies. He teaches us to look upon every needy soul
 as our brother, and the world as our field."—The Desire of Ages, page 823.


                       Lesson 13, for June 24, 1950

         The Triumphs of Faithful Stewardship
   MEMORY VERSE: "Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet
appear what we shall be: but we know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like
Him; for we shall see Him as He is." 1 John 3:2.
   STUDY HELPS: S. A. Wellman, "Your Stewardship and Mine," chapter 13;
"Counsels on Stewardship," pages 339-350.
    INTRODUCTORY NOTE: "Fellow pilgrim, we are still amid the shadows and
turmoil of earthly activities; but soon our Saviour is to appear to bring deliverance
and rest. Let us by faith behold the blessed hereafter, as pictured by the hand of God.
He who died for the sins of the world, is opening wide the gates of Paradise to all who
believe on Him. Soon the battle will have been fought, the victory won. Soon we
shall see Him in whom our hopes of eternal life are centered. And in His presence
the trials and sufferings of this life will seem as nothingness. The former things 'shall
not be remembered, nor come into mind.' Cast not away therefore your confidence,
which hath great recompense of reward. For ye have need of patience, that, after ye
have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise. For yet a little while, and
He that shall come, will come, and will not tarry.' 'Israel shall be saved . . . with
an everlasting salvation: ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world without end.' "
—"Prophets and Kings," pages 731, 732.

                           The Hope Set Before Us
   1. What comforting message did Christ leave His troubled
disciples? John 14:1-3.

    2. How did the psalmist refer to this event? Ps. 50:3-5.
                                         [ 36 ]
   NoTE.—Everyone of the "called" in that day will be from among those
who gave their all in Christ's service. In service, time, money, comforts,
home, whatever or wherever their life for Christ called them, they will have
known and 'manifested the true spirit of sacrifice. Each will have entered
into the life and spirit of the blessed Master.

                    Pilgrims and Strangers Here
   3. What did God's faithful children in past ages confess concern-
ing their relationship to this present world? Heb. 11:13.

  4. What declaration did they make? What desire did they
express? What has God prepared for them? Heb. 11:14, 16.

   5. How is the Christian's attitude toward the world, and his
anticipation of the future, referred to? Titus 2:12, 13.

  6. For what did Peter look? What did John see? 2 Peter 3:13;
Rev. 21:1, 2.

   NOTE.—"In the earth made new, the redeemed will engage in the occupa-
tions and pleasures that brought happiness to Adam and Eve in the begin-
ning. The Eden life will be lived, the life in garden and field. . . . There
every power will be developed, every capability increased. The grandest
enterprises will be carried forward, the loftiest aspirations will be reached,
the highest ambitions realized. And still there will appear new heights to
surmount, new wonders to admire, new truths to comprehend, fresh objects
of study to call forth the powers of body and mind and soul."—Prophets
and Kings, pages 730, 731.

    7. What inspired and inspiring picture of the saints' inheritance
is drawn by the prophet Isaiah? Isa. 65:17, 21-25; 11:6-9.

                  The Promises Are to Overcomers
  8. Who will be permitted to, partake of the joys of this better
world? Rev. 22:14; 21:7, 27.

   9. What are indicated to be the things over which complete
victory must be gained by the overcomer? 1 John 2:15, 16.

    10. How is overcoming made possible? 1 John 5:4, 5; 1 Cor.
15:57; Rom. 8:37; Rev. 12:11.
     NoTE.—Victory over the world, the flesh, and the devil can be gained
 only through faith in Christ as our personal Saviour. We cannot accomplish
 this of ourselves. He who overcomes, surrenders all, and, like his Master; is
                                       37
wholly given to doing the will of Him that sent him. There will be no
reservations in such surrender, service, or sacrifice.
, 11. What precious promises are made to those who overcome
and are redeemed?

   ANSWER: (a)     Eat of the tree of life. Rev. 2:7.
    (b) Be saved from the second death. Rev. 2:11.
    (c) Eat of the hidden manna. Rev. 2:17.
    (d) Have power over the nations. Rev. 2:26.
    (e) White raiment (Christ's righteousness), and name confessed before
the heavenly hosts. Rev. 3:5.
    (f) A pillar in God's temple. Rev. 3:12.
    (g) A place on Christ's throne. Rev. 3:21.
    Non.—"Whatever Christ asks us to renounce, He offers in its stead
something better. Often the youth cherish objects, pursuits, and pleasures
that may not appear to be evil, but that fall short of the highest good. They
divert the life from its noblest aim. Arbitrary measures or direct denuncia-
tion may not avail in leading these youth to relinquish that which they hold
dear. Let them be directed to something better than display, ambition, or
self-indulgence. Bring them in contact with truer beauty, with loftier princi-
ples, and with nobler lives. Lead them to behold the One 'altogether lovely.'
When once the gaze is fixed upon Him, the life finds its center. The enthusi-
asm, the generous devotion, al,: passionate ardor of the youth find here
their true object. Duty becomes a delight, and sacrifice a pleasure. To honor
Christ, to become like Him, to work for Him, is the life's highest ambition
and its greatest joy."—Education, pages 296, 297.
   12. What blessed invitation may all who have been faithful
stewards soon expect to hear? Matt. 25:34.

    13. What assurance is given to all who have forsaken the world
to follow Jesus? Mark 10:28-30.

   14. Into whose likeness will the overcomer be transformed in
the day of ingathering? 1 John 3:2.

      NoTE.—"We shall be like Him." "We shall see Him as He is." Our
finite vision sees the presence, the purity of character, the majesty and
power, the love and purity of the Saviour but dimly. We cannot comprehend
Him with these limited powers that we now possess. "Now we see through'
a glass, darkly." Then we shall see Him as He is—our eyes will behold, our
minds will comprehend the perfection of His character, the glory of His
presence, the depths of His love, the breadth of His understanding, and the
wisdom of the way in which He has led our weary feet. All else will be
forgotten when we know Him as He is, and in our overwhelming joy we will
cast our crowns at His feet in love and adoration. The covenant people, the
overcomers, shall dwell with Him throughout eternity, ever learning more
of God's great love and delving more deeply into the secrets of the universe
which His power and wisdom has created and which He controls. May it
be our happy lot through victory to be there!

        THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
      June 24, 1950—French West and Equatorial Africa

    Our world Sabbath school membership has a tremendous challenge this
quarter in the call for medical help for the many thousands who are afflicted
with malaria, the dreaded leprosy, sleeping sickness, tropical ulcers, and
many other diseases in French West and Equatorial Africa. The map on
page 40 will show you the exact location of this territory.
    The overflow of the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering this quarter is dedicated
to the establishing of at least one, regular native hospital in this vast territory.
We have a number of modest dispensaries in French Equatorial Africa which
have performed miracles in their work with sick natives, but such facilities
are insufficient to meet the pressing needs. Something greater must be done
to alleviate the physical suffering of these people. A native convert in the
South Cameroons who was a savage a few years ago, and who was ill, said
not long ago, "We have found a wonderful truth. We are saved for eternity,
but when shall we have our hospital so that our bodies can be cared for and
our diseases healed?"
    What a challenge ! Shall not all give of their means to a greater extent
than ever before to help meet this urgent call,for adequate medical facilities
in French West and Equatorial Africa?
