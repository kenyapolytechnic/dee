ture on Sabbath morning, but by careful study for the next week on Sabbath afternoon,
with daily review or illustration during the week. Thus the lesson will become fixed in
the memory, a treasure never to be wholly lost."—"Education," pages 251, 252.

                    THE VICTORIOUS LIFE

                         Lesson 1, for July 1, 1950

            The Word of God the Basis of Victory
     MEMORY VERSE: "All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profit-
able for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: that the
man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works." 2 Tim. 3:16, 17.
    STUDY HELPS: "The Desire of Ages," pages 114-123, 257, 258; "Christ's Ob-
ject Lessons," pages 107-114 (new ed., pp. 103-113).
                            DAILY STUDY ASSIGNMENT
    1.   General survey of the lesson. 5. "The Desire of Ages," pp. 114-123;
    2.   Questions 1-5.                      257, 258.
    3.   Questions 6-9.                6. "Christ's Object Lessons," pp. 107-
    4.   Questions 10-15.                    114 (new ed., pp. 103-113).
                                        7. Review.

                                Life in the Word
    1. By what should man live? Matt. 4:4.

   2. What does Jesus say concerning the study of the Scriptures?
Of whom do they testify? John 5:39.

                                 Inspired of God
  3. How was the Scripture given? How much of the Scripture
was given in this way? For what is it profitable? 2 Tim. 3:16, 17.

   NoTE.—The Scriptures here mentioned, and which Timothy had known
from a child (2 Tim. 3:15), are those writings now collected under the general
name of the Old Testament. That these now may properly include the New
Testament is attested by the fact that Peter spoke of those who wrested the
writings of Paul, as they do "the other Scriptures," to their own destruction.
See 2 Peter 3:16.
   "The Bible points to God as its author; yet it was written by human hands;
and in the varied style of its different books it presents the characteristics of
the several writers. The truths revealed are all 'given by inspiration of God'
(2 Tim. 3:16) ; yet they are expressed in the words of men. The Infinite One
by His Holy Spirit has shed light into the minds and hearts of His servants.
He has given dreams and visions, symbols and figures; and those to whom
the truth was thus revealed, have themselves embodied the thought in human
language.
   "The Ten Commandments were spoken by God Himself, and were written
by His own hand. They are of divine, and not of human composition. But the
                                           [3]
Bible, with its God-given truths expressed in the language of men, presents
a union of the divine and the human. Such a union existed in the mature of
Christ, who was the Son of God and the Son of man. Thus it is true of the
Bible, as it was of Christ, that `the Word was made` flesh, and dwelt among
us.' John 1:14."—The Great Controversy, Introduction, pages v, vi.

   4. By what agency were holy men of God, or prophets, moved
to speak? 2 Peter 1:21.

   NoTE.—In the Revised Version 2 Peter 1:21 reads: "For no prophecy ever
came by the will of man: but men spake from God, being moved by the Holy
Spirit." Men were the instruments; but when they spoke for God, they were
moved by the Holy Spirit.
  5. Who spoke to the fathers in times past? Through whom did
He speak? Heb. 1:1.

                   The Testimony of the Prophets
   6. Whence did Isaiah receive his messages? Isa. 6:7.9; 8:1.

  7. Who was the source of the message of Ezekiel the prophet?
Ezek. 1:3; 3:4, 10, 11; 33:7.

   NOTE.—" 'It is not the words of the Bible that are inspired, but the men
that were inspired. Inspiration acts not on the man's words or his expressions
but on the man himself, who, under the influence of the Holy Ghost, is imbued
with thoughts. But the words receive the impress of the individual mind. The
divine mind is diffused. The divine mind and will is combined with the human
mind and will; thus the utterances of the man are the word of God.' "—Ellen
G. White, manuscript No. 24, quoted by F. M. Wilcox in The Testimony of
Jesus, 1944 ed., p. 18.

   8. What carefulness was demanded of Jeremiah in delivering
his God-given messages? Jer. 26:2.

   9. How much higher are God's thoughts than man's thoughts?
Isa. 55:8, 9.

    NOTE.—God's words contain a depth of meaning which only His Spirit can
fully reveal to us.
    "Receive into the soul by faith the incorruptible seed of the word, and it
will bring forth a character and a life after the similitude of the character and
the life of God."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 38.

                            The Word of Life
   10. What are the words of the Lord said to be? John 6:63, 68.
                                      14]
    NOTE.—"God will make the most precious revelations to His hungering,
thirsting people. They will find that Christ is a personal Saviour. As they feed
upon His word, they find that it is spirit and life. The word destroys the
natural, earthly nature, and imparts a new life in Christ Jesus."—The Desire
of Ages, page 391.
   11. What does the apostle call these words? Phil. 2:16.

    NoTE.—In 1 John 1:1 the same expression, "Word of life," is also applied
to Christ. As the written word is the revelation of God to man, so Christ, the
Word made flesh, revealed His Father's love and opened the way to eternal
life. Both rightly are called the "Word of life," for in each the life and love
of God is manifested, and each has, and is able to impart, the attributes of
eternal life. See 1 Peter 1:24, 25; John 6:47.
   12. What is the place of the word in the Christian's armor? Eph.
6:17. Compare Rev. 1:16.

    NOTE.—"The relations between God and each soul are as distinct and full
as though there were not another soul for whom He gave His beloved Son."
—Steps to Christ, page 105.

                          Esteeming the Word
  13. How did Jeremiah express his appreciation of the words of
God? Jer. 15:16.

  14. What estimation did Job place upon the words of God? Job
23:12.

   NOTE.—"Satan well knows that all whom he can lead to neglect prayer and
the searching of the Scriptures, will be overcome by his attacks. Therefore he
invents every possible device to engross the mind."—The Great Controversy,
page 519.
  15. How do God's words affect the believer's life? Ps. 119:103,
130.
    NOTE.—"As our physical life is sustained by food, so our spiritual life is
sustained by the word of God. And every soul is to receive life from God's
word for himself. As we must eat for ourselves in order to receive nourish-
ment, so we must receive the word for ourselves. . . . We should carefully
study the Bible, asking God for the aid of the Holy Spirit, that we may under-
stand His word."—The Desire of Ages, page 390.


   Have you formed the habit of daily lesson study? "None but those who
have fortified the mind with the truths of the Bible will stand through the last
great conflict."—The Great Controversy, pages 593, 594.
                                      L53
                        Lesson 2, for July 8, 1950

        Power of God's Word in Victorious Living
    MEMORY VERSE: "For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper-
than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and
of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart."
Heb. 4:12.
    STUDY HELPS: "The Great Controversy," pages 593-602 (new ed., pp. 669-
679); "Education," pages 189-192; "Steps to Christ," pages 92-96.
                           DAILY STUDY ASSIGNMENT                      •
   1.   General survey of the lesson.  5. "The Great Controversy," pp. 593-
   2.   Questions 1-3.                      602 (new ed., pp. 669-679).
   3.   Questions 4-7.                6. "Education," pp. 189-192.
   4.   Questions 8-14.                     "Steps to Christ," pp. 92-96.
                                       7. Review.

                          Authority of the Word
   1. What is said of God's word in heaven? Ps. 119:89.

    NOTE.—There was once a controversy in heaven concerning the authority
of God's word. "Michael [Christ] and His angels fought against the dragon
[Satan] ; and the dragon fought and his angels." Rev. 12:7. The integrity
and power of God's word were sustained, and it was forever settled in heaven
among the angelic host and unfallen worlds that God's word is true, and must
stand forever.
  2. How were the heavens made? How was the power of the Lord
manifested? Ps. 33:6, 9. Compare Heb. 11:3.

    NOTE.—"The creative energy that called the worlds into existence is in the
word of God. This word imparts power; it begets life. Every command is
a promise; accepted by the will, received into the soul, it brings with it the
life of the Infinite One. It transforms the nature, and re-creates the soul in
the image of God."—Education, page 126.
   3. Of what are men willingly ignorant? How are the present
heavens and earth kept? 2 Peter 3:5-7.

    NoTE.—While scientists may speculate and guess concerning the origin of
the world, the one who believes God's word knows how it came into existence.
It is only because men "willfully forget" (2 Peter 3:5, A.R.V.), that they are
ignorant concerning creation.
                             Power of the Word
   4. By what forceful figures is the power of God's word set forth?
Jer. 23:29.

   5. What is the regenerating agency in the new birth? 1 Peter
1:23; James 1:18.
                                        [ 6]
    No7E.—The power of living things to reproduce themselves is the highest
manifestation of life in nature. So in spiritual things, the life in the word has
power to reproduce itself in human lives through the experience of the new
birth, and this supremely important re-creative experience is accomplished
through the regenerating power of God's word when its life-giving power is
planted in the heart.
   6. What are some of the characteristics of God's word? Heb.
4:12.

  7. How should this word be received? What will the word of
God do? 1 Thess. 2:13.

               Healing and-Deliverance in the Word
   8. When God's people in distress cry to Him, what is sent to heal
their troubles? Ps. 107:19, 20.

   9. How did the centurion whose servant was sick show his faith
in the power of Jesus' word? Matt.•8:5-8.

   10. What reply did Jesus make? What was the result? Matt.
8:13.

  11. What effect did the word of Jesus have upon the stormy sea?
Mark 4:37-39, 41.

    NOTE.—The difference between God's word and man's word is infinite.
Only the Spirit of God can reveal its depth and meaning to us. When spoken
faithfully and received, it will have effect, and produce righteousness in the
hearts of those who believe.

               Effect of the Word in the Heart
  12. What will be the effect of the word when hidden in the
heart? Ps. 119:11.

   NorE.—"Temptations often appear irresistible because, through neglect of
prayer and the study of the Bible, the tempted one cannot readily remember
God's promises and meet Satan with the Scripture weapons."—The Great
Controversy, page 600.

    13. By what do we grow? 1 Peter 2:1, 2.

   NOTE.—"The word of God is the seed. Every seed has in itself a germi-
nating principle. In it the life of the plant is enfolded. So there is life in God's
word. Christ says, The words that I speak unto you, they are Spirit and they
are life.' . . . In every command and in every promise of the word of God
                                         f7 )
is the power, the very life of God, by which the command may be fulfilled and
the promise realized. He who by faith receives the word is receiving the
very life and character of God. Every seed brings forth fruit after its kind.
Sow the seed under right conditions, and it will develop its own life in the
plant. Receive into the soul by faith the incorruptible seed of the word,
and it will bring forth a character and a life after the similitude of the char-
acter and the life of God."—Christ's.Object Lessons, page 38.
   14. By what is the heart cleansed? john 15:3.


                     Lesson 3, for July 15, 1950

               Victory—The Mission of Jesus
    MEMORY VERSE: "But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through
our Lord Jesus Christ." 1 Cor. 15:57.
    STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pages 19-26,124-131.
                         DAILY STUDY ASSIGNMENT
   1. General survey of the lesson. 5. "The Desire of Ages," pp. 19-26.
   2. Questions 1-4.                6. "The Desire of Ages," pp. 124-131.
   3. Questions 5-9.                 7. Review.
   4. Questions 10-14.
                      Christ's Mission
   1. Through whom has God designed victory to be gained? 1 Cor.
15:57.

  2. What was the mission of Jesus to this world? Matt. 1:21, 23.
Compare Luke 19:10.

    NOTE.—Jesus saves His people not in sin, but from sin.
    "From the beginning, God and Christ knew of the apostasy of. Satan, and
of the fall of man through the deceptive power of the apostate. God did not
ordain that sin should rxist, but He foresaw its existence, and made provision
to meet the terrible emergency."—The Desire of Ages, page 22.
                       Victor in Human Flesh
   3. Whose nature did Jesus take upon Himself? What four rea-
sons for this are listed by the apostle? Heb. 2:14-18.

    NOTE.—"It was Satan's purpose to bring about an eternal separation be-
tween God and man; but in Christ we become more closely united to God
than if we had never fallen. In taking our nature, the Saviour has bound
Himself to humanity by a tie that is never to be broken. Through the eternal
ages He is linked with us. 'God so loved the world, that He gave His only-
begotten Son.' He gave Him not only to bear our sins, and to die as our sacri-
fice; He gave Him to the fallen race. To assure us of His immutable counsel
of peace, God gave His only-begotten Son to become one of the human family,
forever to retain His human nature."—The Desire of Ages, page 25.
                                     [s]
   4. What testimony is borne concerning His life? 1 Peter 2:22;
John 19:4.

   NOTE.—Pilate was the trial judge. After he had heard all the evidence
which the enemies of Christ could bring against Him who, when reviled, reviled
not, when suffering, threatened not, Pilate was not able to find any fault in
Him. No one since Pilate's day has been able to find any fault in Him. We
have a sinless Saviour.
                          Looking Unto Jesus
   5. To whom are we to look for salvation? Isa. 45:22, 25; Heb.
12:1, 2.

  6. How did Jesus illustrate this in His night talk with Nicode-
mus? John 3:14, 15. Compare Num. 21:5-9.

    NOTE.—"To the cross of Calvary, bearing a dying Saviour, we must look.
Our eternal interests demand that we show faith in Christ."—The Desire of
Ages, page 660.
    "The lifting up of the brazen serpent was to teach Israel an important
lesson. They could not save themselves from the fatal effect of the poison in
their wounds. God alone was able to heal them. Yet they were required to
show their faith in the provision which He had made. They must look, in
order to live. It was their faith that was acceptable with God, and by looking
upon the serpent their faith was shown. . . . So the sinner may look to Christ,
and live. He receives pardon through faith in the atoning sacrifice. Unlike
the inert and lifeless symbol, Christ has power and virtue in Himself to heal
the repenting sinner."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pages 430, 431.
   7. In whom only can salvation be found? Acts 4:12. Compare
Isaiah 63:1-3.
                             Mighty to Save
   8. To what extent is Jesus able to save? Heb. 7:25. Compare
Isa. 63:1.

    NOTE.—"Those whose course has been most offensive to Him He freely
accepts; when they repent, He imparts to them His divine Spirit, places them
in the highest positions of trust, and sends them forth into the camp of the
disloyal to proclaim His boundless mercy."—The Desire of Ages, page 826.
    "When Satan seeks to cover the people of God with blackness, and ruin
them, Christ interposes. Although they have sinned, Christ has taken the
guilt of their sins upon His own soul. He has snatched the race as a brand
from the fire. By His human nature He is linked with man, while through. His
divine nature He is one with the infinite God. Help is brought within the reach
of perishing souls. The adversary is rebuked."—Christ's Object Lessons,
page 169.
    9. Through whom are we washed from our sins? Rev. 1:5.
                             [ s]
   10. What assurance have we that the Lord remembers His peo-
ple? Ps. 40:17; Ex. 28:29.
    NOTE.—"So Christ, the great High Priest, pleading His blood before the
Father in the sinner's behalf, bears upon His heart the name of every repent-
ant, believing soul."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 351.
   11. What is Christ made to every believer? 1 Cor. 1:30; 2 Cor.
5:21.
                  Triumph Over Weakness
   12. How is man's helplessness to save himself expressed? John
15:5; Jer. 13:23.

   13. By what illustration does the Saviour show wherein the
strength of the believer lies? John 15:2-4, 7.
    NOTE.—"The life of the vine becomes the life of the branch. So the soul
dead in trespasses and sins receives life through connection with Christ. By
faith in Him as a personal Saviour the union is formed. The sinner unites his
weakness to Christ's strength, his emptiness to Christ's fullness, his frailty to
Christ's enduring might. Then he has the mind of Christ. The humanity of
Christ has touched our humanity, and our humanity has touched divinity.
Thus through the agency of the Holy Spirit man becomes a partaker of the
divine nature. He is accepted in the Beloved."—The Desire of Ages, pages
675, 676.

   14. To whom will the redeemed through all eternity ascribe

                                       7. Review.

                   The Standard of Perfection
    1. What is sin? 1 John 3:4; 5:17, first part.
                                110 •
   2. What examples are given by the wise man of what sin is?
Prov. 24:9; 10:19.

   3. How did the Saviour magnify the law? Matt. 5:21-28.

  4. What standard of moral perfection is to characterize those
waiting for the coming of the Lord? 2 Peter 3:14; 1 Thess. 5:23.

    NoTE.—"If one sin is cherished in the soul, or one wrong practice retained
in the life, the whole being is contaminated. The man becomes an instrument
of unrighteousness."—The Desire of Ages, page 313.

                       Victory Assured
   5. What will the armor of God enable us to do? Eph. 6:13.

    NoTE.—We are to stand, not flee from the enemy. There is no armor for
the back. Victory has been defined as the abandonment of every known sin
and obedience to every known duty.
    "We can overcome. Yes; fully, entirely. Jesus died to make a way of
escape for us, that we might overcome every evil temper, every sin, every
temptation, and sit down at last with Him."—Testimonies, vol. 1, p. 144.
    "I would not dishonor my Master so much as to admit that a careless,
trifling, prayerless person is a Christian. No; a Christian has victory over his
besetments, over his passions. There is a remedy for the sin-sick soul. That
remedy is in Jesus. Precious Saviour! His grace is sufficient for the weakest;
and the strongest must also have His grace or perish."—Ibid., page 158.

    6. How continuous may be our victory through Jesus? Where
is this victory manifest? 2 Cor. 2:14.

     NOTE.—"The love of God does not lead Him to excuse sin. He did not
excuse it in Satan; He did not excuse it in Adam or in Cain ; nor will He excuse
it in any other of the children of men. He will not connive at our sins or over-
look our defects of character. He expects us to overcome in His name."—
Christ's Object Lessons, page 316.

  7. What further assurance of victory is given us through Him
who loves us? Rom. 8:35-37.
   NOTE.—"The tempter's agency is not to be accounted an excuse for one
wrong act. Satan is jubilant when he hears the professed followers of Christ
making excuses for their deformity of character. It is these excuses that lead
to sin. There is no excuse for sinning. A holy temper, a Christlike life, is
accessible to every repenting, believing child of God."—The Desire of Ages,
page 311.
                    Perfection of Character
   8. To what state of character must we attain in order to see God
in peace when He comes? Heb. 12:14.
                                111] .
   .NorE.—"The ideal of Christian_ character is Christlikeness. As the Son of
man was perfect in His life, so His followers are to be perfect in their life.
Jesus was in all things made like unto His brethren. He became flesh, even
as we are. He was hungry and thirsty and weary. He was sustained by food
and refreshed by sleep. He shared the lot of man; yet He was the blameless
Son of God. He was God in the flesh. His character is to be ours."—The De-
sire of Ages, page 311.

   9. From what does the psalmist say the Lord will preserve us?
Ps. 121:7.
   NOTE.—"Satan carefully studies the constitutional sins of men, and then
he begins his work of alluring and ensnaring them. We are in the thickest of
temptations, but there is victory for us if we fight manfully the battles of the
Lord."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 97.

   10. What standard of life did Jesus set before the man healed
of an infirmity? John 5:14.
   NOTE.—"How many, when they are made well, forget the hand that has
healed them, and, instead of gratitude and obedience to God, use their renewed
health and strength in the service of sin ! Those who make this use of God's
mercies may consider their restoration as a respite only from perdition."—
Adam Clarke, Commentary, note on John 5:14.
                    The Promised Power
   11. What power is promised to the believer? Eph. 1:17-20; Col.
1:29.

   NOTE.—"Satan cannot hold the dead in his grasp when the Son of God
bids them live. He cannot' hold in spiritual death one soul who in faith re-
ceives Christ's word of power."—The Desire of Ages, page 320.

   12. What assurance of power was given to the disciples? Luke
9:1. Compare James 4:7.

   13. How did the seventy testify concerning the power given to
them? What additional assurance was given? What was a greater
cause of rejoicing? Luke 10:17-20.

   14. In whom are we complete? Col. 1:19; 2:9, 10.

                    Victory Through Surrender
    MEMORY VERSE: "Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed
on Thee: because he trusteth in Thee." Isaiah 26:3.

   2.   Questions 1-5.                  6. "Steps to Christ," pp. 47-52.
   3.   Questions 6-10.                 7. Review.
   4.   Questions 11-14.

                           Redemption
   1. Who redeemed us? What price was paid for our redemption?
1 Peter 1:18-20; Acts 20:28; Eph. 5:2.

   2. To whom then do we belong? 1 Cor. 6:19, 20; Rom. 14:8.

   3. How do we become children of God? Gal. 3:26.

    NOTE.—"The only faith that will benefit us is that which embraces Him
as a personal Saviour; which appropriates His merits to ourselves. Many hold
faith as an opinion. Saving faith is a transaction by which those who receive
Christ join themselves in covenant relation with God. Genuine faith is life.
A living faith means an increase of vigor, a confiding trust, by which the soul
becomes a conquering power."—The Desire of Ages, page 347.

   4. What is the nature of the transaction by which we become
children of God? Rom. 10:9-13.

   5. What is our reasonable service? Rom. 12:1.
              Surrender in the Life of Victory
   6. What surrender does the Lord ask us to make? Prov. 23:26.

   NOTE.—"No man who makes any reserve can be the disciple of Christ,
much less can he be His colaborer."—The Desire of Ages, page 273.
   "We do not belong to Christ unless we are His wholly. It is by halfhearted-
ness in the Christian life that men become feeble in purpose and changeable
in desire."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 50.
   "Many who profess to be His followers have an anxious, troubled heart,
because they are afraid to trust themselves with God. They do not make a
complete surrender to Him; for they shrink from the consequences that such
a surrender may involve. Unless they do make this surrender, they cannot
find peace."—The Desire of Ages, page 330.
                                     [13 7
   7. To whom are we to yield ourselves? Rom. 6:13.

   NoTE.—It is ourselves for which the Lord calls. We may render service,
money, stock, farms, even our own bodies, yet withhold ourselves. "I seek not
yours, but you" (2 Cor. 12:14), wrote the apostle. There is no substitute for
an unconditional surrender of the heart.
   8. What assurance of victory is given to those who thus yield
themselves? Rom. 6:14.

    NOTE.—"When the Spirit of God takes possession of the heart, it trans-
forms the life. Sinful thoughts are put away, evil deeds are renounced; love,
humility, and peace take the place of anger, envy, and strife. Joy takes the
place of sadness, and the countenance reflects the light of heaven. No one
sees the hand that lifts the burden, or beholds the light descend from the
courts above. The blessing comes when by faith the soul surrenders itself to
God. Then that power which no human eye can see creates a new being in
the image of God."—The Desire of Ages, pages 172, 173.
                      Power Through Surrender
   9. What power is promised to the believer? Jude 24; 1 Peter
1:3-5; Isa. 26:3.
    NoTE.—"When the soul surrenders itself to Christ, a new power takes pos-
session of the new heart. A change is wrought which man can never accom-
plish for himself. It is a supernatural work, bringing a supernatural element
into human nature. The soul that is yielded to Christ becomes His own fortress,
which He holds in a revolted world, and He intends that no authority shall
be known in it but His own. A soul thus kept in possession by the heavenly
agencies is impregnable to the assaults of Satan."—The Desire of Ages, pages
323, 324.
   10. What example of a surrendered life is left us by the church
of Macedonia? 2 Cor. 8:5.

   NOTE.—"First gave their own selves." When we consecrate ourselves first
to God, then we will lay all we have on the altar, to be used as His providences
shall indicate. There will then be plenty of workers and funds to finish the
work in all the world.

              Wholehearted Seeking of the Lord
   11. How fully did all Judah once seek the Lord? With what
result? 2 Chron. 15:12, 15.

   12. How fully does the Lord search the heart? 1 Chron. 28:9.

   NOTE.—"The righteousness of Christ will not cover one cherished sin."—
Christ's Object Lessons, page 316.
                                   [ 14 ]
  13. What solemn exhortation applies to the church at this time?
Zeph. 2:1-3.

  14. What encouraging promise is given to those who seek the
Lord with all their heart? 2 Chron. 7:14.
    Narc.—"Many are inquiring, 'How am I to make the surrender of myself
to God?' You desire to give yourself to Him, but you are weak in moral
power, in slavery to doubt, and controlled by the habits of your life of sin.
Your promises and resolutions are like ropes of sand. You cannot control your
thoughts, your impulses, your affections. The knowledge of your broken prom-
ises and forfeited pledges weakens your confidence in your own sincerity, and
causes you to feel that God cannot accept you ; but you need not despair. What
you need to understand is the true force of the will. This is the governing
power in the nature of man; the power of decision, or of choice. Every-
thing depends on the right action of the will. The power of choice God has
given to men; it is theirs to exercise. You cannot change your heart, you
cannot of yourself give to God its affections; but you can choose to serve
Him. You can give Him your will; He will then work in you to will and to
do according to His good pleasure. Thus your whole nature will be brought
under the .control of the Spirit of Christ ; your affections will be centered upon
Him, your thoughts will be in harmony with Him."—Steps to Christ, pages
51, 52.



                       Lesson 6, for August 5, 1950

          Victory Through an Indwelling Christ
    MEMORY VERSE: "I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not
I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith
of the. Son of God, who loved me, and gave Himself for me." Gal. 2:20.

   1.   General survey of the lesson.  5. Questions 11-14.
   2.   Questions 1-3.                 6. "Steps to Christ," pp. 71-80.
   3.   Questions 4-6.                 7. Review.
   4.   Questions 7-10.

                                  Christ Within
  1. How is the close relationship between the Father, the Son,
and the believer expressed? John 17:21.

    2. What is our hope of glory? Col. 1:27.

   NOTE.—"The only defense against evil is the indwelling of Christ in the
heart through faith in His righteousness. Unless we become vitally connected
with God, we can never resist the unhallowed effects of self-love, self-indul-
                                 • i15 1
gence, and temptation to sin. We may leave off many bad habits, for the time
we may part company with Satan; but without a vital connection with God,
through the surrender of ourselves to Him moment by moment, we shall be
overcome. Without a personal acquaintance with Christ, and a continual
communion, we are at the mercy of the enemy, and shall do his, bidding in
the end."—The Desire of Ages, page 324.
   3. Whose life is to be manifest in the believer? 2 Cot. 4:10, 11.

   NoTE.—It is only through an abiding Christ within the heart, that His life
can be manifest in our lives. To dwell there, He must have all the heart.
Christ will not share with anything else the throne of the heart.
                   Divinity Revealed in Humanity
  4. Who was revealed in the life of the apostle Paul? For what
purpose? Gal. 1:15, 16.

   5. What promise is made to those in whom Christ dwells? Rom.
8:10, 12, 13.

    NoTi.—Faith is more than a passive state of mind, a mere acknowledgment
of belief. It is an active principle that engages the power of the will. It means
such a harmony with the indwelling Christ that sin loses its power in the life,
and our desires, our thinking, and our conduct become conformable to His will.
   6. For what did Paul have great travail of soul? Gal. 4:19.

            By Faith Through Operation of the Spirit
   7. What was the apostle's condition? Who lived in him? What
did he say further relative to the life he was living? Gal. 2:20.

   8. How is Christ brought into the heart? Eph. 3:16, 17.

    NOTE.-"It is faith that connects us with heaven, and brings us strength
for coping with the powers of darkness. In Christ, God has provided means
for subduing every sinful trait, and resisting every temptation, however
strong."—The Desire of Ages, page 428.
   9. What was included in Jesus' prayer for all believers? John
17:23.

   10. Through what agency does Jesus come into the heart? John
14:16, 17.

   NoTE.—"It is through the Spirit that Christ dwells hi us; and the Spirit
of God, received into the heart by faith, is the beginning of the life eternal."
—The Desire of Ages, page 388.
                                    [16 7
  11. How willing is Jesus to come into the heart that opens to
Him? Rev. 3:20.

    NOTE.—" 'Behold I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear My voice,
and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with
Me.' I saw that many have so much rubbish piled up at the door of their
heart that they cannot get the door open. Some have difficulties between
themselves and their brethren to remove. Others have evil tempers, selfish
covetousness, to remove before they can open the door. Others have rolled
the world before the door of their heart, which bars the door. AJl this rubbish
must be taken away, and then they can open the door and welcome the
Saviour in.
    "Oh, how precious was this promise, as it was shown to me in vision ! 'I
will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with Me.' Oh, the love, the
wondrous love of God ! After all our lukewarmness and sins He says, 'Return
unto Me, and I will return unto thee, and will heal all thy backslidings.' This
was repeated by the angel a number of times. 'Return unto Me, and I will
return unto thee, and will heal all thy backslidings.' "—Testimonies, vol. 1,
p. 143.
    "Marvelous will be the transformation wrought in him who by faith opens
the door of the heart to the Saviour."—The Ministry of Healing, page 93.

                     Assurance of Victory
   12. What assurance have we that Christ's dwelling in the heart
gives victory? 1 John 4:4.

   NOTE.—"Henceforward Christ's followers were to look upon Satan as a
conquered foe. Upon the cross, Jesus was to gain the victory for them ; that
victory He desired them to accept as their own."—The Desire of Ages, page 490.
    It is encouraging to the struggling child of God to know that he is contend-
ing against a foe who has been conquered, whose kingdom has been spoiled
and triumphed over. "When Jesus was laid in the grave, Satan triumphed.
He dared to hope that the Saviour would not take up His life again. He
claimed the Lord's body, and set his guard about the tomb, seeking to hold
Christ a prisoner. He was bitterly angry when his angels fled at the approach
of the heavenly messenger. When he saw Christ come forth in triumph, he
knew that his kingdom would have an end, and that he must finally die."—
Ibid., page 782.

   13. What is Christ called? 1 Sam. 15:29, margin; Ps. 20:5.

    NoTE.—Psalm 20:5, the Revised Version, margin, reads, "We will triumph
in Thy victory." Christ met the enemy upon every point where we must meet
him (Heb. 4:15), and won the victory. This victory was not for Himself, but
for us. When we open our heart and Jesus comes in, He brings to us the
victory which He Himself won over all the powers of darkness.

   14. With Christ abiding in the heart, what is our blessed con-
dition? Col. 2:9, 10.
                                     117]

to the obedience of Christ." 2 Cor. 10:5.

                                    Self -Control
    1. What is a greater achievement than taking a city? Prov. 16:32.

   2. What is one able to do who can control his words? James 3:2.

    NOTE.—"The power of speech is a talent that should be diligently culti-
vated. Of all the gifts we have received from God, none is capable of being
a greater blessing than this. With the voice we convince and persuade; with
it we offer prayer and praise to God, and with it we tell others of the Redeem-
er's love. How important, then, that it be so trained as to be most effective
for good."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 335.

    3. What evil is in the power of an unruly tongue? James 3:4-6.

  4. How did Christ emphasize the importance of our words?
Matt. 12:34-37.

   'NOTE.—"Not one word is to be spoken unadvisedly. No evilspeaking, no
frivolous talk, no fretful repining or impure suggestion, will escape the lips
of him who is following Christ. The apostle Paul, writing by the Holy Spirit,
says, 'Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth.' A corrupt
communication does not mean only words that are vile. It means any expres-
sion contrary to holy principles and pure and undefiled religion. It includes
impure hints and covert insinuations of evil. 'Unless instantly resisted, these
lead to great sin."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 337.
    "Closely connected with Christ's warning in regard to the sin against the
Holy Spirit is a warning against idle and evil words."—The Desire of Ages,
page 323.

                       Controlling the Thoughts
   5. What promise of victory over our thoughts is given us? 2 Cor.
10:4, 5.

    NoTE.—"There was in Him [Jesus} nothing that responded to Satan's
sophistry. He did not consent to sin. Not even by a thought did He yield
to temptation. So it may be with us."—The Desire of Ages, page 123.
    "The light shining from the cross reveals the love of God. His love is draw-
ing us to Himself. If we do not resist this drawing, we shall be led to the, foot
of the cross in repentance for the sins that have crucified the Saviour. Then
the Spirit of God through faith produces a new life in the soul. The thoughts
and desires are brought into obedience to the will of Christ. The heart, the
mind, are created anew in the image of Him who works in us to subdue all
things to Himself."—Ibid., page 176.
   6. Upon what should we think? Phil. 4:8.

   NOTE.—"Dwell upon the good qualities of those with whom you associate,
and see as little as possible of their errors and failings. . . . Let nothing but
kind, loving words fall from your lips concerning the members of your family
or of the church."—Testimonies, vol. 2, pp. 437, 438.

                        Conti-Oiling the Tongue
   7. What lies in the power of the tongue? Prov. 18:21.

   8. From what should the tongue be kept? Ps. 34:13.

  9. How is the difficulty of controlling the tongue illustrated?
James 3:7, 8.

   NOTE.—"If you are striving for the immortal inheritance with an earnest-
ness, energy, and zeal proportionate to its value, then can you be a fair candi-
date for everlasting life, an heir of glory. You need a fresh conversion every
day. Die daily to self, keep your tongue as with a bridle, control your words,
cease your murmurings and complaints, let not one word of censure escape
your lips. If this requires a great effort, make it; you will be repaid in so
doing."—Testimonies, vol. 1, p. 699.

                                Not Judging
   10. Instead of judging and condemning others, what should we
rather do? Matt. 7:1-5; Rom. 2:1; 14:13.

    NOTE.—"He who is guilty of wrong, is the first to suspect wrong. By con-
demning another he is trying to conceal or excuse the evil of his own heart.
It was through sin that men gained the knowledge of evil; no sooner had the
first pair sinned than they began to accuse each other; and this is what
                                      [ 19
human nature will inevitably do, when uncontrolled by the grace of Christ."
—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, pages 181, 182.
    "If Christ is in you 'the hope of glory,' you will have no disposition to
watch others, to expose their errors. Instead of seeking to accuse and con-
demn, it will be your object to help, to bless, and to save. In dealing with
those who are in error, you will heed the injunction, Consider 'thyself, lest
thou also be tempted.' . . .
    "He who looks often upon the cross of Calvary, remembering that his sins
placed the Saviour there, will never try to estimate the degree of his guilt in
comparison with that of others. He will not climb upon the judgment seat
to bring accusation against another. There can be no spirit of criticism or
self-exaltation on the part of those who walk in the shadow of Calvary's cross.
    "Not until you feel that you could sacrifice your own self-dignity, and
even lay down your life, in order to save an erring brother, have you cast the
beam out of your own eye, so that you are prepared to help your brother.
Then you can approach him, and touch his heart. No one has ever been re-
claimed from a wrong position by censure and reproach; but many have thus
been driven from Christ, and led to seal their hearts against conviction."—
Ibid., pages 183-185.

   11. Who shall abide in the tabernacle of the Lord? Ps. 15:1-3.

    NOTE.—"The habit of backbiting, gossip, ungenerous criticism . . . re-
veals a lack of culture and refinement and of true goodness of heart; it unfits
one both for the society of the truly cultured and refined in this world and
for association with the holy ones of heaven. We think with horror of the
cannibal who feasts on the still warm and trembling flesh of his victim; but
are the results of even this practice more terrible than are the agony and ruin
caused by misrepresenting motive, blackening reputation, dissecting character?
Let the children, and the youth as well, learn what, God says about these
things."—Education, page 235.

   12. How does the apostle Paul commend graceful speech? Col.
4:6; Eph. 4:29.

    NOTE.—"Through the apostle Paul, Christ bids us, 'Let your speech be
alway with grace.' Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your
mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister
grace unto the hearers.' In the light of these scriptures the words of Christ
upon the mount are seen to condemn jesting, trifling, and unchaste conversa-
tion. They require that our words should be not only truthful, but pure."—
Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, page 106.

              The Remnant's Mastery of the Tongue
  13. To what high standard in respect to their speech will the
remnant attain? Zeph. 3:13.

  14. What should be the daily prayer of the overcomer? Ps. 19:14;
141:3. Compare Rev. 14:5.

                                 Teach Us to Pray
   1. What request did the disciples make of Jesus upon a certain
occasion? Luke 11:1.

    NOTE.—"It was from hours spent with God that He came forth, morning
by morning, to bring the light of heaven to men. The disciples had come to
connect His hours of prayer with the power of His words and works. Now,
as they listened to His supplication, their hearts were awed and humbled. As
He ceased praying, it was with a conviction of their own deep need that they
exclaimed, 'Lord, teach us to pray.' "—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing,
page 152.
  2. What example of prayer has our Saviour left us? Mark 1:35;
Luke 5:15, 16; 6:12.

   NOTE.—"The early morning often found Him [Jesus] in some secluded
place, meditating, searching the Scriptures, or in prayer."—The Ministry of
Healing, page 52.

   3. What was the Saviour doing when He received the baptism
of the Holy Spirit? Luke 3:21, 22.

    NoTE.—"Upon coming up out of the water, Jesus bowed in prayer on the
 riverbank. . . . The Saviour's glance seems to penetrate heaven as He pours
 out His soul in prayer. Well He knows how sin has hardened the hearts of
 men, and how difficult it will be for them to discern His mission, and accept
 the gift of salvation. He pleads with the Father for power to overcome their
 unbelief, to break the fetters with which Satan has enthralled them, and in
 their behalf to conquer the destroyer. He asks for the witness that God accepts
 humanity in the person of His Son.
    "Never before have the angels listened to such a prayer. They are eager
                                         [ 21 I
to bear to their loved Commander a message of assurance and comfort. But
no; the Father Himself will answer the petition of His Son. Direct from the
throne issue the beams of His glory. The heavens are opened, and upon the
Saviour's head descends a dovelike form of purest light,—fit emblem of Him,
the meek and lowly One."—The Desire of Ages, pages 111, 112.
   4. What occurred as Jesus and three of His disciples were pray-
ing on a mountain? Luke 9:28-31.

    NOTE.—"The Saviour's promise to the disciples was now fulfilled. Upon
the mount the future kingdom of glory was represented in miniature,—Christ
the King, Moses a representative of the risen saints, and Elijah of the trans-
lated ones."—The Desire of Ages, page 422.

                               Secret Prayer
   5. What did Jesus teach regarding secret prayer? Matt. 6:5, 6.

   NorE.—"The darkness of the evil one encloses those who neglect to pray.
The whispered temptations of the enemy entice them to sin; and it is all because
they do not make use of the privileges that God has given them in the divine
appointment of prayer. Why should the sons and daughters of God be reluc-
tant to pray, when prayer is the key in the hand of faith to unlock heaven's
storehouse, where are treasured the boundless resources of Omnipotence?
Without unceasing prayer and diligent watching, we are in danger of growing
careless and of deviating from the right path."—Steps to Christ, pages 98, 99.

   6. What example of secret prayer is left us by the Saviour? Luke
9:18, first part.

    NOTE.—"We should pray in the family circle; and above all we must not
neglect secret prayer; for this is the life of the soul. It is impossible for the
soul to flourish while prayer is neglected. Family or public prayer alone is
not sufficient. In solitude let the soul be laid open to the inspecting eye of
God. Secret prayer is to be heard only by the prayer-hearing God. No
curious ear is to receive the burden of such petitions. In secret prayer the soul
is free from surrounding influences, free from excitement. Calmly, yet fer-
vently, will it reach out after God. Sweet and abiding will be the influence
emanating from Him who seeth in secret, whose ear is open to hear the prayer
arising from the heart."—Steps to Christ, pages 102, 103.

   7. What special instruction is given concerning continuing in
prayer? Eph. 6:18; 1 Tim. 2:8; 1 Thess. 5:17.

   8. In what does the Lord delight? Prov. 15:8.

  9. What promises are given to those who pray? Matt. 21:22;
Luke 11:9, 10.
                           [22]
                   Prayer and Victory
  10. How only can victory be gained over the power of the en-
emy? Mark 9:29.

  11. How earnestly were the disciples seeking the Lord just before
Pentecost? With what results did the apostles pray? Acts 1:14; 4:31.

   NOTE.—"The disciples prayed that greater strength might be imparted to
them in the work of the ministry; for they saw that they would meet the same
determined opposition that Christ had encountered when upon the earth.
While their united prayers were ascending in faith to heaven, the answer came."
—The Acts of the Apostles, pages 67, 68.

  12. When we call upon the Lord in time of trouble, what has
He promised to do? Ps. 107:6; 50:14, 15.

   13. Upon what condition has the Lord promised to hear prayer?
2 Chron. 7:14.
  14. What admonition should we earnestly heed at this time?
Col. 4:2; Rom. 12:12.
    NOTE.—"Every prayer offered in faith lifts the suppliant above discourag-
ing doubts and human passions. Prayer gives strength to renew the conflict
with the powers of darkness, to bear trials patiently, and to endure hardness
as good soldiers of Christ."—Testimonies, vol. 3, p. 323.
    "The victory is not won without much earnest prayer, without the hum-
bling of self at every step."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, page 204.


                    Lesson 9, for August 26, 1950
         Examples of Victory Through Prayer
    MEMORY VERSE: "Whatsoever ye shall ask in My name, that will I do, that
the Father may be glorified in the Son." John 14:13.
    STUDY HELPS: "Patriarchs and Prophets," pages 195-203; "Prophets and
Kings," pages 355-362, 539-548; "The Acts of the Apostles," pages 143-154.

   1. General survey of the lesSon.  5. "Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 195-

                                     7. Review.
                     Incentive to Prayer
   1. What cheering promise did Jesus leave as an incentive to
prayer? John 14:13.
                                     [ 23 ]
   NoTE.—"Then press your petition to the Father in the name of Jesus. God
will honor that name. . . . When we come to Him confessing our unworthi-
ness and sin, He has pledged Himself to give heed to our cry. The honor of
His throne is staked for the fulfillment of His word unto us."—Christ's Object
Lessons, page 148.
   "To pray in the name of Jesus is something more than a mere mention of
that name at the beginning and the ending of a prayer. It is to pray in the
mind and spirit of Jesus, while we believe His promises, rely upon His grace,
and work His works."—Steps to Christ, page 105.
   2. At what set times did the psalmist call upon God? Ps. 55:17.

   3. What was the custom of Daniel in this matter? Dan. 6:10, 13.

   NOTE.—"Both in public and in private worship, it is our privilege to bow
on our knees before God when we offer our petitions to Him."—Prophets and
Kings, page 48.
                         Intercessory Prayer
   4. When Israel sinned in making the golden calf, how did God
respond to the prayer of Moses? Ex. 32:9-14.

   NOTE.—"Moses discerned ground for hope where there appeared only dis-
couragement and wrath. The words of God, 'Let Me alone,' he understood
not to forbid but to encourage intercession, implying that nothing but the
prayers of Moses could save Israel, but that if thus entreated, God would
spare His people."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 318.
   "As Moses interceded for Israel, his timidity was lost in his deep interest
and love for those for whom he had, in the hands of God, been the means of
doing so much. The Lord listened to his pleadings, and granted his unselfish
prayer."—Ibid., page 319.

   5. What did Hezekiah do with the letter of the king of Assyria?
Isa. 37:8-20.

   6. What deliverance came from the hand of the Lord in answer
to his prayer? Isa. 37:33-36; 2 Chron. 32:20, 21.

    Num.—We should not fail to note that when Israel was involved in a
terrible crisis, Hezekiah sent to the prophet of God to inquire if he had any
instruction for them. And the Lord had not forgotten His people; He sent
them a message of hope. What a worthy example is here presented before us
by Hezekiah ! He took the threatening letter of the king, and "spread it before
the Lord." When in trouble and almost overwhelmed with difficulty, we, too,
can obtain help by bringing it to the Lord, and earnestly seeking Him for help.

                     Prayer and Restoration
    7. When Elijah was urged by the widow to restore her son to
life, what did he do? 1 Kings 17:17-22.
                                L 24 ]
   8. For what did Elijah pray on another occasion during a time
of great apostasy? James 5:17, 18. Compare 1 Kings 17:1; 18:41-45.

    NoTE.—"Faith such as this is needed in the world today,—faith that will
lay hold on the promises of God's word, and refuse to let go until Heaven hears.
Faith such as this connects us closely with Heaven, and brings us strength for
coping with the powers of darkness."—Prophets and Kings, page 157.

   9. When Dorcas died, for whom did the believers send? What
scene did Peter behold on his arrival? Acts 9:36-41.

    NOTE.—Though we may fall under the dominion of death, be poverty-
stricken and comparatively unknown; though there may be no flowers upon
the bier, if there are those mourning our death whom, while living, we helped
when in need, those who can tell of our unselfish almsgiving and deeds of
kindness, the obsequies will be grander than those of the potentates of earth.

                        Prayer and Deliverance
   10. When Peter was in prison, what was the church doing? Acts
12:5.

   11. What wonderful deliverance came to the Lord's servant in
answer to the prayers of the church? Acts 12:6-10.

    NOTE.—"The same angel who had come from the royal courts to rescue
Peter, had been the messenger of wrath and judgment to Herod. The angel
smote Peter to arouse him from slumber: it was with a different stroke that
he smote the wicked king, laying low his pride, and bringing upon him the
punishment of the Almighty. Herod died in great agony of mind and body,
under the retributive judgment of God. . .
    "We need to understand better than we do the mission of the angels. It
would be well to remember that every true child of God has the co-operation
of heavenly beings. Invisible armies of light and power attend the meek and
lowly ones who believe and claim the promises of God. Cherubim and ser-
aphim, and angels that excel in strength, stand at God's right hand, 'all minis-
tering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation.'"
 —The Acts of the Apostles, pages 152-154.
   12. When Paul and Silas were in prison, what did they do, and
with what results? Acts 16:25-31.

                           Submission in Prayer
   13. What example did Jesus give in the matter of submitting to
the will of God in His prayer? Matt. 26:39, 42.

   NOTE.—"While presenting our petitions with earnestness, we should say,
 `Nevertheless not my will, but Thine, be done.' Jesus added these words of
                                    [ 25 ]
submission to the wisdom and will of God when in the Garden of Gethsemane
He pleaded, '0 My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from Me.' And
if they were appropriate for Him, the Son of God, how much more are they
becoming on the lips of finite, erring mortals!
    "The consistent course is to commit our desires to our all-wise heavenly
Father, and then, in perfect confidence, trust all to Him. We know that God
hears us if we ask according to His will. But to press our petitions withotit
a submissive spirit is not right; our prayers must take the form, not of com-
mand, but of intercession."—The Ministry of Healing, page 230.
  14. How does the Holy Spirit make intercession for the saints?
Rom. 8:26, 27.


                     Lesson 10, for September 2, 1950

                        Victory Through Faith
    MEMORY VERSE: "Whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and
this'is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith." 1 John 5:4.

   4.   Questions 10-14.

                              Possibilities of Faith
   1. What things are possible to the believer? Mark 9:23; Matt.
21:22.

    NoTE.—"Where anxiety begins faith ends, where faith begins anxiety ends."
—Muller.
    "It is faith that connects us with heaven, and brings us strength for coping
with the powers of darkness. In Christ, God has provided means for subduing
every sinful trait, and resisting every temptation, however strong."—The De-
sire of Ages, page 428.
  2. What must we have to please God? What must those who
come to God believe? Heb. 11:6.

   NOTE.—"As you come to Him, believe that He accepts you, because He has
promised. You can never perish while you do this—never."--The Ministry
of Healing, page 66.
   "Faith can endure trial, resist temptation, bear up under disappointment."
—Ibid., page 488.

                        Overcoming the World
   3. What alone gives victory to the struggling soul? 1 John 5:4.

    4. What three basic temptations must be overcome? 1 John 2:16.

    5. How does Christ dwell in our hearts? Eph. 3:17.

  6. What shield is given to the believer? What will this shield
do? Eph. 6:16.

   7. What hinders the fulfillment of God's promises to us? James
1:6, 7; Mark 11:24.

    NoTE.—"God reaches for the hand of faith in us to direct it to lay fast hold
upon the divinity of Christ, that we may attain to perfection of character."
—The Desire of Ages, page 123.
    "As Jesus was in human nature, so God means His followers to be. In His
strength we are to live the life of purity and nobility which the Saviour lived."
—The Ministry of Healing, page 426.

                                Deliverance
  8. What proclamation of deliverance is made to those in the
bondage of sin? Isa. 61:1-3.

    NoTE.—"Jesus knows the circumstances of every soul. The greater the
 sinner's guilt, the more he needs the Saviour. His heart of divine love and
 sympathy is drawn out most of all for the one who is the most hopelessly
 entangled in the snares of the enemy. With His own blood He has signed the
 emancipation papers of the race.
    "Jesus does not desire those who have been purchased at such a cost to
 become the sport of the enemy's temptations. He does not desire us to be
 overcome and perish. He who curbed the lions in their den, and walked with
 His faithful witnesses amid the fiery flames, is just as ready to work in our
 behalf, to subdue every evil in our nature. Today He is standing at the altar
-of mercy, presenting before God the prayers of those who desire His help.
 He turns no weeping, contrite one away. Freely will He pardon all who come
 to Him for forgiveness and restoration."—The Ministry of Healing, pages
89, 90.

   9. What further assurance of deliverance is given the captives?
Isa. 49:24, 25.

    NOTE.—"The Lord Jesus is making experiments on human hearts through
the exhibition of His mercy and abundant grace. He is affecting transforma-
tions so amazing that Satan with all his triumphant boasting, with all his con-
                                     [ 27 ]
federacy of evil united against God and the laws of His government, stands
viewing them as a fortress impregnable to his sophistries and delusions. They
are to Him an incomprehensible mystery. The angels of God, seraphim and
cherubim, the powers commissioned to co-operate with human agencies, look
on with astonishment and joy, that fallen men, once children of wrath, are
through the training of Christ developing characters after the divine similitude,
to be sons and daughters of God, to act an important part in the occupations
and pleasures of heaven."—Ellen G. White, in General Conference Bulletin,
1893, page 409.

  10. What assurance is given for every tempted soul? Heb. 2:18.
Compare 1 Cor. 10:13.

  NOTE.-"Our Redeemer has opened the way so that the most sinful, the
most needy, the most oppressed and despised, may find access to the Father."
—The Desire of Ages, page 113.

   11. What should deliverance lead men to do? Ps. 107:20-22.

   12. What declaration of faith did Paul once make under trying
circumstances? Acts 27:22-25.

              Abraham's Victory Through Faith
  13. How did Abraham lay hold of a wonderful promise of God?
Rom. 4:19-22.

   14. For whom was this written? Rom. 4:23-25.

    NoTE.—Victory is not received "by works of righteousness which we have
done," but is wholly the gift of God, received by faith. Until we believe that
God will give us the victory personally we can never receive it. There can
be no victory without faith.
    "After the union with Christ has been formed, it can be preserved only by
earnest prayer and untiring effort. We must resist, we must deny, we must
conquer self. Through the grace of Christ, by courage, by faith, by watchful-
ness, we may gain the victory."—Ellen G. White, in Review and Herald, Dec.
13, 1887.
    "Victories are not gained by ceremonies or display, but by simple obedi-
ence to the highest General, the Lord God of heaven. He who trusts in this
Leader will never know defeat. Obedience to God is liberty from the thralldom
of sin, deliverance from human passion and impulse. Man may stand conqueror
of himself, conqueror of his own inclinations, conqueror of principalities and
powers, and of the 'rulers of the darkness of this world,' and 'of spiritual wick-
edness in high places.' "—Ellen G. White, in Review and Herald, Dec. 17, 1908.

                       Power for a Victorious Life
   1. How much can we do in our own strength to attain to a life
of victory? John 15:5; 2 Cor. 12:9.

    NOTE.—"The effort to earn salvation by one's own works, inevitably leads
men to pile up human exactions as a barrier against sin. For, seeing that they
fail to keep the law, they will devise rules and regulations of their own to
force themselves to obey. All this turns the mind away from God to self.
His love dies out of the heart, and with it perishes love• for their fellow men.
A system of human invention, with its multitudinous exactions, will lead its
advocates to judge all who come short of the prescribed human standard.
The atmosphere of selfish and narrow criticism stifles the noble and generous
emotions, and causes men to become self-centered judges and petty spies.
    "The Pharisees were of this class. They came forth from their religious
services, not humbled with a sense of their own weakness, not grateful for the
great privileges that God had given them. They came forth filled with spiritual
pride, and their theme was, 'Myself, my feelings, my knowledge, my ways.'
Their own attainments became the standard by which they judged others. Put-
ting on the robes of self-dignity, they mounted the judgment seat, to criticize
and condemn."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, pages 177, 178.

    2. Through Christ what are we able to do? Phil. 4:13; Col. 1:11.

    NOTE.—"There is no limit to the usefulness of one who, by putting self
aside, makes room for the working of the Holy Spirit upon his heart, and lives
a life wholly consecrated to God."—The Desire of Ages, page 250.

    3. In what is the power of a victorious life? Zech. 4:6.

   NOTE.—"The omnipotent power of the Holy Spirit is the defense of every
contrite soul. Not one that in penitence and faith has claimed His protection
will Christ permit to pass under the enemy's power. The.Saviour is by the
side of His tempted and tried ones."—The Desire of Ages, page 490.
                                     [ 29 ]
    "Suddenly, as the Spirit comes with more direct appeal, the soul gladly
surrenders itself to Jesus. By many this is called sudden conversion ; but it
is the result of long wooing by the Spirit of God,—a patient, protracted proc-
ess."—I bid., page 172.

                            Promised Power
  4. What promise did Jesus make to His disciples concerning the
Holy Spirit? John 14:16-18, 26.

   5. Of whom would He testify? John 15:26.

   6. What would be the work of the Holy Spirit? John 16:7-13.

   NoxE.—"There is no safety for one who has merely a legal religion, a form
of godliness. The Christian's life is not a modification or improvement of the
old, but a transformation of nature. There is a death to self and sin, and a
new life altogether. This change can be brought about only by the effectual
working of the Holy Spirit."—The Desire of Ages, page 172.

   7. Of what did Jesus assure His disciples on the day of His as-
cension? Acts 1:4, 5, 8.

    NOTE.—"In the great and measureless gift of the Holy Spirit are contained
all of heaven's resources. It is not because of any restriction on the part of
God that the riches of His grace do not flow earthward to men. If all were
willing to receive, all would become filled with His Spirit."—Christ's Object
Lessons, page 419.
    "In all who will submit themselves to the Holy Spirit a new principle of
life is to be implanted; the lost image of God is to be restored in humanity."
—Ibid., page 96.
                    Operation of the Holy Spirit
   8. By what means is victory wrought in the life? Rom. 8:11-14;
John 3:3-8.

  9. How is the willingness of the Lord to give us the Holy Spirit
expressed? Luke 11:13.

   10. What is the fruit of the Spirit? Gal. 5:22, 23.

    NOTE.—"Wherever there is an impulse of love and sympathy, wherever
the heart reaches out to bless and uplift others, there is revealed the work-
ing of God's Holy Spirit. In the depths of heathenism, men who have had
no knowledge of the written law of God, who have never even heard the
name of Christ, have been kind to His servants, protecting them at the risk
of their own lives. Their acts show the working of a divine power. The Holy
                                    C30]
Spirit has implanted the grace of Christ in the heart of the savage, quickening
his sympathies contrary to his nature, contrary to his education. The 'Light
which lighteth every man that cometh into the world,' is shining in his soul;
and this light, if heeded, will guide his feet to the kingdom of. God."—Christ's
Object Lessons, page 385.
   11. What sentence did the Saviout pronounce upon the fruitless
fig tree? Mark 11:12-14, 20, 21.

    NoTE.—"Christ's act in cursing the tree which His own power had created
stands as a warning to all churches and to all Christians. No one can live the
law of God without ministering to others. But there are many who do not
live out Christ's merciful, unselfish life. Some who think themselves excellent
Christians do not, understand what constitutes service for. God. They plan and
study to please themselves. They act only in reference to self. Time is of
value to them only as they can gather for themselves. In all the affairs of life
this is their object. Not for others but for themselves do they minister. God
created them to live in a world where unselfish service must be performed.
He designed them to help their fellow men in every possible way. But self
is so large that they cannot see anything else. They are not in touch with
humanity. Those who thus live for self are like the fig tree, which made every
pretension, but was fruitless. They observe the forms of worship, but without
repentance or faith. In profession they honor the law of God, but obedience
is lacking. They say, but do not. In the sentence pronounced on the fig tree
Christ demonstrates how hateful in His eyes is this vain pretense. He declares
that the open sinner is less guilty than is he who professes to serve God,,but
who bears no fruit to His glory."—The Desire of Ages, page 584.
                          Spiritual Refreshing
   12. For what spiritual refreshing are we urged to pray at this
time? Zech. 10:1.

   13. What promise of the latter rain is given? Joel 2:23.

    NOTE.-"I heard those clothed with the armor speak forth the truth in
great power. It had effect. I saw those who had been bound; some wives
had been bound by their husbands, and some children had been bound by
their parents. The honest who had been held or prevented from hearing the
truth, now eagerly laid hold of it. All fear of their relatives was gone. The
truth alone was exalted to them. It was dearer and more precious than life.
They had been hungering and thirsting for truth. I asked what had made this
great change. An angel answered, 'It is the latter rain, the refreshing from
the presence of the Lord, the loud cry of the third angel.'"—Testimonies, vol.
1, pp. 182, 183.
   14. What blessed invitation is given to all? Rev. 22:17; John
7:37, 38.
   NorE.—"The cry of Christ to the thirsty soul is still going forth, and it
appeals to us with even greater power than to those who heard it in the temple
on that last day of the feast. The fountain is open for all. The weary and
exhausted ones are offered the refreshing draft of eternal life."—The Desire
of Ages, page 454.

                  Lesson 12, for September 16, 1950

    Repentance and Confession Precede Victoiy
    MEMORY VERSE: "Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may
be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord."
Acts 3:19.
    STUDY HELPS: "Steps to Christ," pages 26-46; "Christ's Object Lessons,"
pages 202-207 (new ed., pp. 204-209).
                           DAILY STUDY ASSIGNMENT
   1.   General survey of the lesson.  5. "Steps to Christ," pp. 26-46.
   2.   Questions 1-4.                6. "Christ's Object Lessons," pp. 202-
   3.   Questions 5-8.                       207 (new ed., pp. 204-209).
   4.   Questions 9-14.                7. Review.

                  Called to Repentance
  1. What was the mission of Jesus to this world? Luke 5:32;
Matt. 9:13.

   2. What exhortation to repent is given through an ancient
prophet? Ezek. 18:30.

    NOTE.—"No repentance is genuine that does not work reformation. The
righteousness of Christ is not a cloak to cover unconfessed and unforsaken
sin; it is a principle of life that transforms the character and controls the
conduct. Holiness is wholeness for God; it is the entire surrender of heart
and life to the indwelling of the principles of heaven."—The Desire of Ages,
page 555.
    Repentence is not simply:
    a. Fear. In a storm at sea, when all seems lost, passengers may be filled
with fear, yet not repent of sin.
    b. Feeling. A convict may feel very sorry, not because of the enormity
of his sin, but because he has been caught, and must be punished for his crimes.
    c. Bodily affliction. We may fast, or punish our bodies, even give ourselves
to be burned, yet not repent.
    d. Remorse. Judas had such remorse that he committed suicide, but he
did not truly repent of his sin.
    e. Conviction of sin. Many are under continual condemnation and con-
viction of sin, and feel that they should repent of sin by turning away from
it; but because they love sin, they refuse to abandon it.
     f. Praying. We may pray, and yet cling to that which is evil, and refuse
to repent.
     g. Stopping some sin. A drunkard may "brace up," and stop drinking or
using profane language, and yet not really repent of his sins.

   3. How is this exhortation repeated by another prophet of olden
times? Jer. 3:12-14.
                                          32
   NOTE.—True repentance is a turning away from sin, a surrender of that
which is wrong, a facing in an opposite direction, a yielding wholly and un-
reservedly to the dictates of the Holy Spirit. It means a reformation of life.

   4. What message did John the Baptist bear? Matt. 3:1, 2, 7, 8.

  5. When Peter, on the Day of Pentecost, was asked by the people
what they must do to be saved, what did he answer? Acts 2:38.

   NOTE.—"The arguments of the apostles alone, though clear and convinc-
ing, would not have removed the prejudice that had withstood so much
evidence. But the Holy Spirit sent the arguments home to hearts with divine
power. The words of the apostles were as sharp arrows of the Almighty,
convicting men of their terrible guilt in rejecting and crucifying the Lord of
glory."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 45.

   6. To what example of repentance did the Saviour direct atten-
tion on a certain occasion? Matt. 12:40, 41. Compare Jonah 3:4-10.

    NOTE.—"As Jonah entered the city, he began at once to 'cry against' it
the message, 'Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.' From street
to street he went, sounding the note of warning.
    "The message was not in vain. The cry that rang through the streets of
the godless city was passed from lip to lip, until all the inhabitants had heard
the startling announcement. The Spirit of God pressed the message home to
every heart, and caused multitudes to tremble because of their sins, and to
repent in deep humiliation."—Prophets and Kings, page 270.

                                 Confession
   7. What promise is given to those who confess their sins? Prov.
28:13; Lev. 26:39-44.

     No'rE.—"True repentance will lead a man to bear his guilt himself, and
acknowledge it without' deception or hypocrisy. Like the poor publican, not
lifting up so much as his eyes unto heaven, he will cry, 'God be merciful to me
a sinner.' "—Steps to Christ, page 45.

    8. To whom is salvation promised? Rom. 10:9, 10.

  9. What example of confession was seen in the life of Daniel?
Dan. 9:4, 5.

   Nora.—"Secret sins are to be confessed in secret to God; but, for open sin,
open confession is required."—The Desire of Ages, page 811.

                      Pardon Follows Repentance
    10. How is pardon for sin received? 1 John 1:9.
                                      [ 33 ]
   11. What leads the sinner to repentance? Rom. 2:4, last part.

    NOTE.—"The love of God still yearns over the one who has chosen to sep-
arate from Him, and He sets in operation influences to bring him back to the
Father's house. The prodigal son in his wretchedness 'came to himself.' The
deceptive power that Satan had exercised over him was broken. He saw that
his suffering was the result of his own folly, and he said, 'How many hired
servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with
hunger! I will arise and go to my Father.' Miserable as he was, the prodigal
found hope in the conviction of his father's love. It was that love which was
drawing him toward home. So it is the assurance of God's love that con-
strains the sinner to return to God. 'The goodness of God leadeth thee to
repentance.' A golden chain, the mercy and compassion of divine love, is
passed around every imperiled soul. The Lord declares, 'I have loved thee
with an everlasting love; therefore with loving-kindness have I drawn thee.' "
—Christ's Object Lessons, page 202.

   12. From whom do we receive repentance? Acts 5:31; 2 Tim.
2:25.
   NOTE.—"We cannot even repent without the aid of the Spirit of God. . . .
Repentance comes from Christ as truly as does pardon."—The Desire of Ages,
page 175.
   13. How many are called upon to repent? Acts 17:30.

   14. What cheering promises are made to those who come to
God by repentance and forsaking of sin? John 6:37; Isa. 1:18;
Jer. 3:22, 23.

                Lesson 13, for September 23, 1950

                    Obedience and Victory
    MEMORY VERSE: "If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the
land." Isa. 1:19.
    STUDY HELPS: "Steps to Christ," pages 61-70; "Christ's Object Lessons,"
pages 311-319 (new ed., pp. 318-325).
                         DAILY STUDY ASSIGNMENT
   1. General survey of the lesson,   5. "Steps to Christ," . pp., 61-70.
   2. Questions 1-4.                  6. "Christ's Object Lessons," pp. 311-
   3. Questions 5-10.                      319 (new edt, pp. 318-325).
   4. Questions 11-14.                7. Review.

                          Value of Obedience
   1. How did God value obedience in ancient times? 1 Sam. 15:22.

  2. To whom is salvation promised in the New Testament?
Heb. 5:9.
                                    [ 34 ]
  3. What effect did Paul's preaching have upon the Gentiles?
Rom. 15:18.

   4. What effect did the preaching of God's word have upon the
priests in Jerusalem? Acts 6:7.

                          Christ's Obedience
   5. What is said of the obedience of Christ? Heb. 5:8; Phil. 2:8.

    NOTE.—"The tempter thought to take advantage of Christ's humanity,
and urge Him to presumption. But while Satan can solicit, he cannot compel
to sin. He said to Jesus, 'Cast Thyself down,' knowing that he could not cast
Him down; for God would interpose to deliver Him. Nor could Satan force
Jesus to cast Himself down. Unless Christ should consent to temptation, He
could not be overcome. Not all the power of earth or hell could force Him
in the slightest degree to depart from the will of His Father."—The Desire
of Ages, page 125.
    "The foe who in the wilderness had confronted Christ assailed Him now
with fierce and subtle temptations. Had Jesus yielded for a moment, had He
changed His course in the least particular to save Himself, Satan's agencies
would have triumphed, and the world would have been lost."—The Desire of
Ages, page 486.

   6. How does this obedience affect us? Rom. 5:19.

                         Complete Obedience
   7. How complete should our obedience be? 2 Cor. 10:5.

   8. How is purity of soul related to obedience? 1 Peter 1:22.

   9. To whom will the Holy Spirit be given? Acts 5:32.

   10. How may we know that we know Christ? 1 John 2:3.

                     Obedience From the Heart
   11. For what kind of obedience does Paul thank God? Rom.
6:17.
     NOTE.—The only obedience worth while is that which comes from the
heart. Obedience prompted by fear is slavery. Obedience prompted by love
is liberty,
     "The exercise of force is contrary to the principles of God's government;
He desires only the service of love; and love cannot be commanded; it can-
not be won by force or authority: Only by love is love awakened. To know
God is to love Him; His character must be manifested in contrast to the
character of Satan. This work only one Being in all the universe could do.
                                    [ 35 ]
Only He who knew the height and depth of the love of God could make it
known. Upon the world's dark night the Sun of Righteousness must rise,
`with healing in His wings.' "—The Desire of Ages, page 22.
   "All true obedience comes from the heart. It was heart work with Christ.
And if we consent, He will so identify Himself with our thoughts and aims,
so blend our hearts and minds into conformity to His will, that when obeying-
Him we shall be but carrying out our own impulses. The will, refined and
sanctified, will find its highest delight in doing His service. When we know
God as it is our privilege to know Him, our life will be a life of continual
obedience. Through an appreciation of the character of Christ, through
communion with God, sin will become hateful to us."—Ibid., page 668.

  12. What did Abraham's spirit of obedience cause him to do?
Heb. 11:8; Gen. 12:1, 4; 22:1-18.

  13. What was imputed to Abraham because of this experience?
What new name did he receive? James 2:23.

   14. To what ultimate experience will obedience lead? 1 Peter
1:14-16.

                 Lesson 14, for September 30, 1950

                Ultimate Victory in Translation

troversy," pages 635-652 (new ed., pp. 717-733).

                          DAILY STUDY ASSIGNMENT
   1.   General survey of the lesson.     5. "The Acts of the Apostles," pp. 593-
   2.   Questions 1-5.                         602.
   3.   Questions 6-9.                    6. "The Great Controversy," pp. 635-
   4.   Questions 10-14.                       652 (new ed., pp. 717-733).
                                          7. Review.

                              Victory Over Death
   1. Before His ascension, what cheering promise did the Saviour
give His people? John 14:1-3.

   2. What assurance did the apostle Paul give of the translation
of the righteous when Jesus appears? 1 Thess. 4:16-18.

  NoTE.—That will indeed be a great hour in the experience of God's people
when the dead in Christ and the living righteous are "caught up together."
"Angels 'gather together the elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven
                                        [ 36 ]
to the other.' Little children are borne by holy angels to their mothers' arms.
Friends long separated by death are united, nevermore to part, and with songs
of gladness ascend together to the city of God."—The Great Controversy,
page 645.

   3. What physical change will those who are translated experi-
ence? 1 Cor. 15:51-54.

    NoTE.—"Soon I heard the voice of God which shook the heavens and the
earth. There was a mighty earthquake. Buildings were shaken down, and fell
on every side. I then heard a triumphant shout of victory, loud, musical, and
clear. I looked upon this company, who, a short time before, were in such
distress and bondage. Their captivity was turned. A glorious light shone upon
them. How beautiful they then looked! All weariness and marks of care
were gone; health and beauty were seen in every countenance. Their enemies,
the heathen around them, fell like dead men. They could not endure the light
that shone upon the delivered, holy ones. This light and glory remained upon
them until Jesus was seen in the clouds of heaven, and the faithful, tried
company were changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, from glory
to glory."—Testimonies, vol. 1, p. 184.

    4. What will be their spiritual condition? 1 John 3:2; Matt. 5:8.


   5. While the righteous will be "caught up" at the coming of the
Lord, what will be the experience of the wicked? 2 Thess. 1:6-10;
Jer. 25:30-33.


                      Preparation for Translation
   6. As a preparation for translation, what solemn call to a deeper
consecration comes to us from the Lord? Amos 4:12; Joel 2:11-17.

  7. How is the same solemn call voiced by another prophet?
Zeph. 2:1-3.

    NarE.—"I saw that many were neglecting the preparation so needful, and
were looking to the time of 'refreshing' and the 'latter rain' to fit them to
stand in the day of the Lord, and to live in His sight. Oh, how many I saw
in the time of trouble without a shelter! They had neglected the needful prep-
aration, therefore they could not receive the refreshing that all must have to
fit them to live in the sight of a holy God. Those who refuse to be hewed
by the prophets, and fail to purify their souls in obeying the whole truth,
and who are willing to believe that their condition is far better than it really
is, will come up to the time of the falling of the plagues, and then see that
they needed to be hewed and squared for the building. But there will be no
time then to do it and no Mediator to plead their cause before the Father."
 —Early Writings, page 71.

                           Enoch and Elijah
   8. What was Enoch's experience before his translation? Heb.
11:5; Gen. 5:22-24.

  NOTE.—"Pray in your closet; and as you go about your daily labor, let
your heart be often uplifted to God. It was thus that Enoch walked with
God."—Steps to Christ, page. 103.

   9. What is said concerning the translation of Elijah? 2 Kings
2:9-11.

    NOTE.—"Elijah was a type of the saints who will be living on the earth
at the time of the second advent of Christ, and who will be 'changed, in a
moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump,' without tasting of
death. It was as a representative of those who shall be thus translated, that
Elijah, near the close of Christ's earthly ministry, was permitted to stand
with Moses by the side of the Saviour on the mount of transfiguration. In
these glorified ones, the disciples saw in miniature a representation of the
kingdom of the redeemed. They beheld Jesus clothed with the light of heaven;
they heard the 'voice out of the cloud,' acknowledging Him as the Son of God;
they saw Moses, representing those who will be raised from the dead at the
time of the second advent; and there also stood Elijah, representing those
who at the close of earth's history will be changed from mortal to immortal,
and be translated to heaven without seeing death."—Prophets and Kings,
page 227.
            Character of Candidates for Translation

   NOTE.—"All heaven was waiting to welcome.the Saviour to the celestial
courts. As He ascended, He led the way, and the multitude of captives set free
at His resurrection followed. The heavenly host, with shouts and acclama-
tions of praise and celestial song, attended the joyous train. . . .
   "Then the portals of the city of God are opened wide, and the angelic
throng sweep through the gates amid a burst of rapturous music.
   "There is the throne, and around it the rainbow of promise. There are
cherubim and seraphim. The commanders of the angel hosts, the sons of God,
the representatives of the unfallen worlds, are assembled. The heavenly
council before which Lucifer had accused God and His Son, the representa-
tives of those sinless realms over which Satan had thought to establish his
                                     f38 ]
dominion,-all are there to welcome the Redeemer. They are eager to celebrate
His triumph and to glorify their King."-The Desire of Ages, pages 833, 834.

  13. What spiritual change will have been experienced by those
who are saved when the Lord comes? Col. 1:13, 14.

Rev. 21:3-7.

SABBATH SCHOOL LESSONS FOR FOURTH QUARTER
    If you ha've not received a senior Lesson Quarterly for the fourth quarter
of this year, the following outline will help you in studying the first lesson.

       THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
      September 30, 1950-Central Pacific Union Mission
    Sabbath school members have a great opportunity this quarter to assist
mightily in the spread of the third angel's message in the islands of the
Central Pacific Union Mission, which is part of the territory of the Austral-
asian Inter-Union Conference. The great need in this mission field is the
establishing of a training school for French Oceania, on the island of Tahiti.
You may locate this readily by referring to the map. Although the advent
message has long been established in these islands, there has been a great
weakness in not having a training school where young people may become
efficient workers. Because of the mountainous character of the island, land
is costly in Tahiti, and we shall have to give liberally to raise sufficient funds
with which to purchase a school site and erect the necessary buildings. On
some of these islands whole villages have been wonderfully transformed
through the power of the gospel, but a still greater work may be done with
the aid of fine young people trained for service.
    In 1948 we gave an overflow of $31,304.11 for the establishing of a school
on Guadalcanal and also one in interior New Guinea. These schools are
already operating.
    Please note that September 30 is the fourteenth Sabbath, allowing an
extra week to save for a generous gift. Let us give generously that our young
people in these islands may have a school in which they may train to quickly
finish the great gospel message in that island field.
