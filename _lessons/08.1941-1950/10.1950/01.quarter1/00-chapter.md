                    OUR LORD'S PRAYER

                               Introduction
   "Jesus gives them [His disciples] no new form of prayer. That which
He has before taught them, He repeats, as if He would say: You need to
understand what I have already given. It has a depth of meaning you have
not yet fathomed."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, page 152.


                     Lesson 1, for January 7, 1950

                            God and Prayer
    MEMORY VERSE: "Without faith it is impossible to please Him; for he that
cometh to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of them that dili-
gently seek Him." Heb. 11:6.

   4. Ques. 7-9.
                          God Is Love
   1. In what language does the apostle John present God? 1 John
4:16.

    NOTE.—" 'God is love,' is written upon every opening bud, upon every
spire of springing grass."—Steps to Christ, page 10.
   2. In what exclamatory language does John direct us to con-
sider this theme? 1 John 3:1.

   NOTE.—"What a precious privilege is this, that we may be sons and
daughters of the Most High, heirs of God and joint heirs with Jesus Christ."
—Testimonies vol. 5, p. 316.
   "As the inspired apostle John beheld the height, the depth, the breadth of
the Father's love toward the perishing race, he was filled with adoration and
                                         [31
reverence; and, failing to find suitable language in which to express the
greatness and tenderness of this love, he called upon the world to behold it.
`Behold, what manner of love the Father bath bestowed upon us, that we
should be called the sons of God.' What a value this places upon man I"—
Steps to Christ, page 17.
   3. What identifies the sons and daughters of God? Rom. 8:14, 15.

  4. What counsel did Jesus give to His disciples concerning the
necessity of prayer? Matt. 26:41.

    NOTE.—"In'the warning to 'watch and pray,' Jesus has indicated the only
safe course. There is need of watchfulness. Our own hearts are deceitful, we
are compassed with the weaknesses and frailties of humanity, and Satan is
intent to destroy. We may be off our guard, but our adversary is never
idle. Knowing his tireless vigilance, let us not sleep, as do others, but 'watch
and be sober.' "—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 409.
   5. To whom, when, and with what assurance does the psalmist
say he will direct his prayer? Ps. 5:2, 3; 55:17; 6:9.

   NoTE.—"In the secret place of prayer, where no eye but God's can see,
no ear but His can hear, we may pour out our most hidden desires and long-
ings to the Father of infinite pity; and in the hush and silence of the soul,
that voice which never fails to answer the cry of human need, will speak
to our hearts."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, page 126.
   6. After their'great sin at Sinai, what did Israel do while Moses
talked to God? What was Moses' request and God's unfailing
promise? Ex. 33:8-14.

   NoTE.—"Those who take Christ at His word, and surrender their souls
to His keeping, their lives to His ordering, will find peace and quietude. Noth-
ing of the world can make them sad when Jesus makes them glad by His
presence. In perfect acquiescence there is perfect rest."—The Desire of Ages,
page 331.

           Conditions Upon Which Prayer Is Answered

   7. What does the psalmist state as a condition of acceptable
service? What assurance did he have? Ps. 66:18-20.

    NoTE.—"Only as we live in obedience to His word can we claim the ful-
fillment of His promises."—The Ministry of Healing, page 227.
    "If the psalmist could not be heard if he regarded iniquity in his heart,
how can the prayers of men now be heard while iniquity is regarded by
them?"—Testimonies. vol. 5, p. 592.
                                       4
   8. In what words did Jesus encourage us to present our requests
to the Father? Matt. 7:7, 8, 11.

   NoTE.—"The Lord specifies no conditions except that you hunger for His
mercy, desire His counsel, and long for His love. 'Ask.' The asking makes it
manifest that you realize your necessity; and if you ask in faith, you will
receive."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, page 187.
   9. For what may we ask, and with what assurance? 1 John
5:14, 15.

   10. After we have asked according to God's will, what should be
our attitude? Mark 11:24.

   NOTE.—"He makes it plain that our asking must be according to God's
will; we must ask for the things that He has promised, and whatever we
receive must be used in doing His will. The conditions met, the promise is
unequivocal.
   "For the pardon of sin, for the Holy Spirit, for a Christlike temper, for
wisdom and strength to do His work, for any gift He has promised, we may
ask; then we are to believe that we receive, and return thanks to God that
we, have reCeived."—Education, page 258.
  11. In the life of Job what experience brought, health to him
and forgiveness for his friends? Job 42:8-10.

   12. With what additional thought does Paul admonish us to
pray for others? Eph. 6:18, 19.

   NoTE,—"They feel that souls are in peril, and with earnest, humble faith
they plead the promises of God in their behalf. The ransom paid by Christ—
the atonement on the cross—is ever before them. They will have souls as
seals of their ministry."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 190.
   13. What mighty Helper is provided to indite our prayers and
to make them effective? Rom. 8:26, 27.

   14. What final admonition does the apostle Paul give in closing
his epistle to the Thessalonians? 1 Thess. 5:17.

   NoTEJ—"We must pray always, if we would grow in faith and experience.
We are to be 'instant in prayer,' to 'continue in prayer, and watch in the
same with thanksgiving.' Peter exhorts believers to be 'sober, and watch
unto prayer.' Paul directs, 'In everything by prayer and supplication with
thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.' But ye, beloved,'
says Jude,,praying in the Holy Ghost, keep yourselves in the love of God.'
Unceasing 'prayer is the unbroken union of the soul with God, so that life
from God flows into our life; and from our life, purity and holiness flow back
to God."—Steps to Christ, page 102.

                     Lesson 2, for January 14, 1950

                         "Teach Us to Pray"
    MEMORY VERSE: "Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we
know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh interces-
sion for us with groanings which cannot be uttered." Rom. 8:26.
    STUDY HELPS: Taylor G. Bunch, "The Perfect Prayer," pages 9-20; "Thoughts
From the Mount of Blessing," pages 119-130.
    SEED THOUGHT: "We must not only pray in Christ's name, but by the
inspiration of the Holy Spirit. This explains what is meant when it is said that the
Spirit 'maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.' Rom 8:26.
Such prayer God delights to answer. When with earnestness and intensity we breathe
a prayer in the name of Christ, there is in that very intensity a pledge from God that
He is about to answer our prayer 'exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.'
Eph. 3 :20."—"Christ's Object Lessons," page 147.

                                               7. Review.

                Christ's Example Creates Prayer Spirit
   1. As the disciples heard Jesus pray, what was their desire and
request? Luke 11:1.

   NoTE.—"The prayer that Christ gave to His disciples in answer to this
request is not made in high-flown language, but expresses in simple words the
necessities of the soul. It is short, and deals directly with the daily needs."—
Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 278.
   2. In what words did Jesus counsel the suppliant against prayers
uttered with selfish ostentation? Matt. 6:5, 6.

    NoTE,--"Christ impressed upon His disciples the idea that their prayers
should be short, expressing just what they wanted, and no more. He gives
the length and substance of their prayers, expressing their desires for temporal
and spiritual blessings, and their gratitude for the same. How comprehensive
this sample prayer! It covers the actual need of all. One or two minutes is
long enough for any ordinary prayer."—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 581.
   3. How did the Lord speak regarding the words to be used in
prayer? Matt. 6:7, 8.

   NoTE.—"The repetition of set, customary phrases, when the heart feels
no need of God, is of the same character as the 'vain repetitions' of the
heathen."—Thbughts From the Mount of Blessing, page 129.
                                         [6]
                       Prayers That Please God
  4. In the parable of the man who asked for bread at midnight,
what lesson did the Master seek to teach? Luke 11:9, 10; James 1:6.

    NoTE.—"There are many who long to help others, but they feel that they
have no spiritual strength or light to impart. Let them present their petitions
at the throne of grace. Plead for the Holy Spirit. God stands back of every
promise He has made."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 147.
   5. What mental attitude renders prayer acceptable to God?
Ps. 51:17.

   NOTE.—"Man must be emptied of self before he can be, in the fullest
sense, a believer in Jesus. When self is renounced, then the Lord can make
man a new creature."—The Desire of Ages, page 280.

   6. What may we confidently know regarding God's faithfulness
in hearing and answering prayer? 1 John 5:14, 15.

   NoTE.—"In some instances of healing, Jesus did not at once grant the
blessing sought. But in the case of leprosy, no sooner was the appeal made
than it was granted. When we pray for earthly blessings, the answer to our
prayer may be delayed, or God may give us something other than we ask;
but not so when we ask for deliverance from sin. It is His will to cleanse us
from sin, to make us His children, and to enable us to live a holy life."—
The Ministry of Healing, page 70.
   7. What is further said of our constant readiness to pray? Luke
18:1.

    NoTE.—"There is no time or place in which it is inappropriate to offer up
a petition to God. There is nothing that can prevent us from lifting up our
hearts in the spirit of earnest prayer. In the crowds of the street, in the
midst of a business engagement, we may send up a petition to God, and plead
for divine guidance, as did Nehemiah when he made his request before King
Artaxerxes. A closet of communion may be found wherever we are. We
should have the door of the heart open continually, and our invitation going
up that Jesus may come and abide as a heavenly guest in the soul."—Steps
to Christ, page 103.
   8. What two short petitions exemplify prayer that will always
bring an immediate answer? Matt. 14:30; Luke 23:42.

    NoTE.—"Immediately Jesus grasps the outstretched hand."—The Desire
of Ages, page 381.
   "Quickly the answer came. Soft and melodious the tone, full of love,
compassion, and power the words: Verily I say unto thee today, Thou shalt
be with me in Paradise."—Ibid., page 750.
                                      17 1
             Humble Prayers That Obtained Answers
   9. What prayers of Solomon, offered in humility, were pleasing
to God, and how were they answered? 1 Kings 3:5-12.

    NOTE.—"The language used by Solomon while praying to God before the
ancient altar at Gibeon, reveals his humility and his strong desire to honor
God. He realized that without divine aid, he was as helpless as a little child
to fulfill the responsibilities resting on him. He knew that he lacked discern-
ment, and it was a sense of his great need that led him to seek God for wis-
dom. In his heart there was no selfish aspiration for a knowledge that would
exalt him above others. He desired to discharge faithfully the duties devolving
upon him, and he chose the gift that would be the means of causing his reign
to bring glory to God. Solomon was never so rich or so wise or so truly
great as when he confessed, 'I am but a little child: I know not how to go
out or come in.'"—Prophets and Kings, page 30.
    "The seal of divine approval had been placed upon this prayer; for at its
close fire had come down from heaven to consume the burnt offering and the
sacrifices, and the glory of the Lord had filled the Temple."—Ibid., page 335.
   10. When imperiled by the armies of Sennacherib, what prayer
did Hezekiah offer? How was he assured that his supplication was
heard? 2 Kings 19:15-20.

   NOTE—"Hezekiah's pleadings in behalf of Judah and of the honor of
their Supreme Ruler, were in harmony with the mind of God. . . . Hezekiah
was not left without hope. Isaiah sent to him, saying: 'Thus saith the Lord
God of Israel, That which thou hast prayed to Me against Sennacherib king
of Assyria I have heard.' "—Prophets and Kings, page 359.
   11. As Daniel studied and found the time of deliverance near,
with what humility did he pray? With what result? Dan. 9:3-6,
20-23.

   NorE.—"Though Daniel had long been in the service of God, and had
been spoken of by heaven as 'greatly beloved,' yet he now appeared before
God as a sinner, urging the great need of the people he loved. His prayer
was eloquent in its simplicity, and intensely earnest."—Prophets and Kings,
page 555.

                          Attitude in Prayer
   12. What does the Lord indicate as to the attitude of the sup-
pliant as he approaches the divine Presence?
  ANSWER: The attitude of the suppliant as he approaches God in prayer
may be learned from the following:
           (a) Ex. 3:2-6; Heb. 12:28.   With reverence.
           (b) Acts 9:40; Luke 9:18.    In quietness and alone.
           (c) Ps. 95:6.                Kneel before Him.
                                   [ 81
    13. What example of brevity and directness in public worship
is found in the Old Testament? 2 Chron. 20:4-12.

     NorE.—"The prayers offered in public should be short and to the point.
. . . A few minutes is long enough for any ordinary public petition. . . .
Long prayers are tiring to those who hear, and do not prepare the people to
listen to the instruction that is to follow. . . . High-flown language is inap-
propriate in prayer, whether the petition be offered in the pulpit, in the fam-
ily circle, or in secret. Especially should the one offering public prayer use
simple language. . . . Both in public and in private worship, it is our privilege
to bow on our knees before the Lord when we offer our petitions to Him."
—Gospel Workers, pages 175-178.
  14. What timely admonition does the apostle Peter give the
church for this time? 1 Peter 4:7.


                     Lesson 3, for January 21, 1950

                              "Our Father"

to address Him by a new name, a name entwined with the dearest associations
               ,
of the human heart.  He gives us the privilege of calling the infinite God our
Father. This name, spoken to Him and of Him, is a sign of our love and trust
toward Him, and a pledge of His regard and relationship to us. Spoken when
asking His favor or blessing, it is as music in His ears. That we might not
think it presumption to call Him by this name, He has repeated it again and
                                     [9]
again. He desires us to become familiar with the appellation."—Christ's

are we thus brought? 2 Cor. 6:17, 18.

words we are to use in approaching God, He places the assurance of 'our
divine relationship,—`Our Father.' "—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing,
page 154.

testify:

hunger of my soul was satisfied; the Bible is to me the revelation of Christ.
I believe in Jesus because He is to me a divine Saviour.' "—Testimonies, vol.
8, p. 321.

self will sink into nothingness."—Counsels to Teachers, page 375.
   10. How does Ezekiel describe his vision of God and of the
throne? Ezek. 1:4-7, 24, 26, 28.

   NoTE.—"As the wheellike complications were under the guidance of the
hand beneath the wings of the cherubim, so the complicated play of human
events is under divine control. Amidst the strife and tumult of nations, He
that sitteth above the cherubim still guides the affairs of the earth."—Educa-
tion, page 178.
   11. With what majestic appearance did the Ancient of Days
reveal Himself to the prophet Daniel? Dan. 7:9, 10.

   No+E.—"The matchless splendor of the earthly tabernacle reflected to
human vision the glories of that heavenly temple where Christ our forerunner
ministers for us before the throne of God. The abiding place of the King of
kings, where thousand thousands minister unto Him, and ten thousand times
ten thousand stand before Him; that temple . . . could find, in the most
magnificent structure ever reared by human hands, but a faint reflection of its
vastness and glory."—The Great Controversy, page 414.

God? Isa. 40:28-31.

As children of God, you will hold His honor, His character, His family, His
work, as the objects of your highest interest. It will be your joy to recognize
and honor your relation to your Father, and to every member of His family.
You will rejoice to do any act, however humble, that will tend to His glory,
or to the well-being of your kindred."—Thoughts From the Mount of Bless-
ing, page 156.

    NOTE.—" 'Which art in heaven.' He to whom Christ bids us look as 'our
Father,' is in the heavens.' ... In His care we may safely rest, saying, 'What
time I am afraid, I will trust in Thee.' Ps. 56:3."—Thoughts From the
Mount of Blessing, page 156.
    "As these [heavenly] angels escorted Him to the courts above, they sang
in triumph, 'Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; 0 sing praises unto
the Lord; to Him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens. . . . Ascribe ye
strength unto God: His excellency is over Israel, and His strength is in the
heavens.' Ps. 68:32-34, margin."—The Acts of the Apostles, pages 32, 33.

   4. Where do the writers of the Bible declare God's throne to be?
Ps. 11:4; 103:19; Isa. 66:1.

   5. In what terms have servants of God described their glimpses
of the throne of God? 1 Kings 22:19; Isa. 6:1-3; Dan. 7:9; Rev.
4:1-5.
   NOTE.—"I saw the Father rise from the throne. The Father 'was en-
shrouded with a body of light and glory, so that His person could not be
seen, yet I knew that it was the Father, and that from His person emanated
                                    [ 12]
this light and glory. . • . The glory, or excellency, of His form, I never
saw; no one could behold it, and live; yet the body of light and glory that
enshrouded His person could be seen."—Early Writings, page 92.
   "The rainbow about the throne is an assurance that God is true; that in
Him is no variableness, neither shadow of turning. . . . He has pledged
Himself to give heed to our cry, when we come to Him confessing our
unworthiness and sin. The honor of His throne is staked for the fulfillment
of His word to us."—Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 23.
   6. How extensive is the rulership of God? Ps. 103:19; Acts
17:24-27.

   7. What great lesson regarding His ,sovereignty is it necessary
for men and nations to learn? Ps. 33:10-14; Dan. 4:17, 25, 26.

     NoTE.—"In the annals of human history, the growth of nations, the rise
and fall of empires, appear as if dependent on the will and prowess of man;
the shaping of events seems, to a great degree, to be determined by his
power, ambition, or caprice. But in the word of God the curtain is drawn
aside, and we behold, above, behind, and through all the play and counter-
play of human interest and power and passions, the agencies of the
All-merciful One, silently, patiently working out the counsels of His own will.
. . . The power exercised by every ruler on the earth is Heaven-imparted;
and upon his use of the power thus bestowed, his success depends.. .
    "To understand these things,—to understand that 'righteousness exalteth
a nation;' that 'the throne is established by righteousness,' and `upholden by
mercy' (Prov. 14:34; 16:12; 20:28) ; to recognize the outworking of these
principles in the manifestation of His power who `removeth kings, and setteth
up kings,'—this is to understand the philosophy of history."—Prophets and
Kings, pages 499-502.
       The Divine Majesty Veiled. From the Sight of Men
   8. What experience of Moses shows that the divine glory must
be veiled from the sight of man? Ex. 33:18-23; 34:5, 6.

  9. For what purpose did God design the sanctuary on earth?
What should be our attitude toward the place where His glory is
manifested? Ex. 25:8; Ps. 77:13.

   NoTE.—"In the sanctuary of the wilderness tabernacle and of the temple
that were the earthly symbols of God's dwelling place, one apartment was
sacred to His presence. The veil inwrought with cherubim at its entrance was
not to be lifted by any hand save one. To lift that veil, and intrude unbidden
into the sacred mystery of the most holy place, was death. For above the
mercy seat dwelt the glory of the Holiest;—glory upon which no man might
look and live. On the one day of the year appointed for ministry in the
most holy place, the high priest with trembling entered God's presence, while
clouds of incense veiled the glory from his sight. Throughout the courts of
the temple every sound was hushed. . . . The host of worshipers, bowed in
silent awe, offered their petitions for God's mercy.
                                     118
    " 'These things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written
for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.' 1 Cor. 10:11.
    " 'The Lord is in His holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before
Him.' Hab. 2:20."—The Ministry of Healing, pages 437, 438.
   10. What was the supreme manifestation of God to man? John
1:18; 14:8, 9. '

    NOTE.—" 'His name shall be called Immanuel, . . . God with us:"The
light of the knowledge of the glory of God' is seen 'in the face of Jesus Christ.'
From the days of eternity the Lord Jesus Christ was one with the Father;
He was 'the image of God,' the image of His greatness and majesty, 'the out-
shining of His glory.' It was to manifest this glory that He came to our
world. To this sin-darkened earth He came to reveal the light of God's love,
—to be 'God with us.' Therefore it was prophesied of Him, 'His name shall
be called Immanuel.' "
    "That we might behold it and not be destroyed, the manifestation of His
glory was shrouded. His divinity was veiled with humanity,—the invisible
glory in the visible human form."—The Desire of Ages, pages 19, 23.

                God in Heaven Cares for His People

  11. Where does God, the litiler of the universe, declare He will
dwell? Isa. 57:15; 2 Cor. 6:16.

   NoTE.—"From the soul that feels his need, nothing is withheld. He has
unrestricted access to Him in whom all fullness dwells. 'For thus saith the
high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in
the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble
spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the
contrite ones.' Isa. 57:15."—The Desire of Ages, page 30.
   12. What assurances are given of God's intimate knowledge of
us and of His care for us? Ps. 34:16; Matt. 6:31, 32; Phil. 4:19.

    Nom.—"He knows each individual by name, and cares for each as if
there were not another upon the earth for whom He gave His beloved Son."
—The Ministry of Healing, page 229.
    "The Bible shows us God in His high and holy place, not in a state of
inactivity, not in silence and solitude, but surrounded by ten thousand times
ten thousand and thousands of thousands of holy beings, all waiting to do His
will. Through these messengers He is in active communication with every
part of His dominion. By His Spirit He is everywhere present. Through the
agency of His Spirit and His angels, He ministers to the children of,men.
   "Above the distractions of the earth He sits enthroned; all things are
open to His divine survey; and from His great and calm eternity He orders
that which His providence sees best."—Ibid., page 417.
  13. What blessings are promised to the ,obedient as God looks
down from His habitation in heaven?. Deut. 26:15; James 1:17.
                                      [ 14 ]
    NorE.—" 'If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:
but if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth
of the Lord hath spoken it.' Here are the promises, plain and definite, rich
and full; but they are all upon conditions. If you comply with the conditions,
can you not trust the Lord to fulfill His word? Let these blessed promises,
set in the framework of faith, be placed in memory's halls. Not one of them
will fail. All that God hath spoken, He will do. 'He is faithful that promised.' "
—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 630.
   14. What is God's ultimate purpose for His earthborn children?
Jer. 29:11; John 14:2, 3.

    NoTE.—"The time has come, to which holy men have looked with longing
since the flaming sword barred the first pair from Eden,—the time for 'the
redemption of the purchased possession.' Eph. 1:14. The earth originally
given to man as his kingdom, betrayed by him into the hands of Satan, and so
long held by the mighty foe, has been brought back by the great plan of
redemption. All that was lost by sin has been restored. . . . God's original
purpose in the creation of the earth is fulfilled as it is made the eternal abode
of the redeemed. . . . 'The tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell
with them, and they shall be His people, and God Himself shall be with them,
and be their God.' Rev. 21:3."—The Great Controversy, pages 674-676.

    3. Ques. 5, 6.                                 7.   Review.

                                  God's Name
  1. In His model prayer how did Jesus express reverence for
God's sacred name? Matt. 6:9.

   2. What is the attitude of those who worship God in heaven?
Isa. 6:3; Rev. 4:8.
                                          [ 15 ]
  3. In His recorded prayer, how did the psalmist hallow God's
name? 1 Chron. 16:23-29; Ps. 95:1-6.

    NOTE.—"We are never in any manner to treat lightly the titles or appella-
tions of the Deity. In prayer we enter the audience chamber of the Most
High; and we should come before Him with holy awe. The angels veil their
faces in His presence. The cherubim and the bright and holy seraphim ap-
proach His throne with solemn reverence. How much more should we, finite,
sinful beings, come in a reverent manner before the Lord, our Maker I"—
Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, page 157.
    "Christ's followers today should guard against the tendency to lose the
spirit of reverence and godly fear. The Scriptures teach men how they
should approach their Maker,—with humility and awe, through faith in a
divine Mediator. . . . True reverence for God is inspired by a sense of His
infinite greatness and a realization of His presence. With this sense of the
Unseen, every heart should be deeply impressed. The hour and place of
prayer are sacred, because God is there. And as reverence is manifested in
attitude and demeanor, the feeling that inspires it will be deepened. 'Holy
and reverend is His name,' the psalmist declares. [Ps. 111:9.1 Angels, when
they speak that name, veil their faces. With what reverence, then, should we,
who are fallen and sinful, take it upon our lips l"—Prophets and Kings,
pages 48, 49.
   4. Who shares the glory due to God? To what is He therefore
entitled? John 1:1, 2; Heb. 1:1-9.

    NoTE.—"The Sovereign of the universe was not alone in His work of benefi-
cence. He had an assodate,—a co-worker who could appreciate His purposes,
and could share His joy in giving happiness to created beings. 'In the begin-
ning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was
God. The same was in the beginning with God.' John 1:1, 2. Christ, the Word,
the Only Begotten of God, was one with the eternal Father,—one in nature,
in character, in purpose,—the only being that could enter. into all the counsels
and purposes of God."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 34.

  5. What other divine personality is embraced in the Godhead?
How should His name and presence be regarded? Matt. 28:19;
Eph. 4:30.

                       Bearing the Family Name
   6. What family unity is effected through Jesus? With what
result? Eph. 3:14, 15; 2 Cor. 6:17, 18.

   7. As members of the family whose name do we bear? Jer.
14:9; Rev. 14:1.

   NorE.—"Of the church of Christ it is written, 'This is the name wherewith
she shall be called, The Lord our Righteousness.' Jer. 33:16. This name is put
upon every follower of Christ. It is the heritage of the child of God. The
                                    (16]
family are called after the Father."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing,
page 157.
  8. Since apostolic times, what have the disciples of the Lord
been called? Acts 11:26, last part.

  Upholding the Dignity and Honor of the Name We Bear
   9. What high honor is conferred in baptism? Matt. 28:19.

     NoTE.—The Revised Version reads: "Go ye therefore, and make disciples
of all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the
Son and of the Holy Ghost."
     "Christ has made baptism the sign of entrance to His spiritual kingdom.
. . ;Before man can find a home in the church, before passing the thresh-
old of God's spiritual kingdom, he is to receive the impress of the divine
name....
     "Those who are baptized in the threefold name of the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit, at the very entrance of their Christian life declare pub-
licly that they have forsaken the service of Satan, and have become members
of the royal family, children of the heavenly King."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 91.
   10. What does the third commandment prohibit? Ex. 20:7.

   NOTE.-It is not only by profanity that the name of the Lord can be
taken in vain. Those who profess to be His children and yet deny Him in
their lives are taking His name in vain.
   "If Christians give the impression by a mournful attitude that they have .
been disappointed in their Lord, they misrepresent His character. . . .
Though in words they may claim God as their Father, yet in gloom and
sorrow they present to the world the aspect of orphans."—Thoughts From
the Mount of Blessing, page 132.
   11. What are the followers of God, declared to be in this world?
Isa. 43:10; Acts 1:8.

    NOTE.-"Our confession of His faithfulness is Heaven's chosen agency for
revealing Christ to the world. We are to acknowledge His grace as made
known through the holy men of old; but that which will be most effectual
is the testimony of our own experience. We are witnesses for God as we
reveal in ourselves the working of a power that is divine."—The Desire of
Ages, page 347.
    "It is the purpoSe of God to glorify Himself in His people before the
world. He expects those who bear the name of Christ to represent Him in
thought, word, and deed. Their thoughts are to be pure and their words
noble and uplifting, drawing those around them nearer the Saviour. The
religion of Christ is to be interwoven with all that they do and say. Their
every business transaction is to be fragrant with the presence of God."—
Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 21.
  12. How did Jesus as our example glorify the Father's name?
John 17:4, 6, 26; 12:28.
                                     [ 17 ]
                    Ultimate Triumph in the Name
   13. What assurance have we that God's name will be univers-
ally honored? Ps. 86:9, 10; Rev. 15:4.

  14. How are the servants of God to be honored at that time?
Rev. 3:12; 14:1; 22:4.

   NoTa.—"Christ took with Him to the heavenly courts His glorified hu-
manity. To those who receive Him He gives power to become the sons of
God, that at last God may receive them as His, to dwell with Him through-
out eternity. If during this life they are loyal to God, they will at last 'see
His face; and His name shall be in their foreheads.' Rev. 22:4. And what is
the happiness of heaven but to see God? What greater joy could come to the
sinner saved by the grace of Christ than to look upon the face of God, and
know Him as Father?"—The Ministry of Healing, page 421.

In the varied gifts of God in nature we see but the faintest gleaming of His glory."
—"Steps to Christ," page 91.
    "Human language is inadequate to describe the reward of the righteous. It will be
known only to those who behold it. No finite mind can comprehend the glory of the
Paradise of God."—"The Great Controversy," page 675.

   2. In what statement did Jesus reveal that the kingdom of God
has a present and inward •meaning? Luke 17:20, margin.

   NOTE.—This phase of the kingdom of God is often referred to as the
kingdom of grace.
   "The kingdom of grace was instituted immediately after the fall of man,
when a plan was devised for the redemption of the guilty race. It then
existed in the purpose and by the promise of God; and through, faith, men
could become its subjects. Yet it was not actually established until the death
of Christ. . . . When the Saviour yielded up His life, and with His expiring
breath cried out, 'It is finished,' then the fulfillment of the plan of redemp-
tion was assured. The promise of salvation made to the sinful pair in Eden
was ratified. The kingdom of grace, which had before existed by the
promise of God, was then established."—The Great Controversy, pages
347,348.
  3. How is this phase of the kingdom of God further set forth
by the apostle Paul? Rom. 14:17.

    NoTE.—"Inward peace and a conscience void of offense toward God, will
quicken and invigorate the intellect, like dew distilled upon the tender plants.
The will is then rightly directed and controlled, and is more decided, and
yet free from perverseness. The meditations are pleasing because they are
sanctified. The serenity of mind which you may possess, will bless all with
whom you associate. This peace and calmness will, in time, become natural,
and will reflect its precious rays upon all around you to be again reflected
upon you. The more you taste this heavenly peace and quietude of mind, the
more it will increase. It is an animated, living pleasure which does not throw
all the moral energies into a stupor, but awakens them to increased activity.
Perfect peace is an attribute of heaven which angels possess."—Testimonies,
vol. 2, p. 327.
    "Open your hearts to receive this kingdom, and make its service your
highest interest. Though it-is a spiritual kingdom, fear not that your needs
for this life will be uncared for."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing,

will lead us beside the living stream, flowing from the throne of God, and
will explain to us the dark providences through which on this earth He
brought us in order to perfect our characters. There we shall behold with
undimmed vision the beauties of Eden restored."—Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 254.

yea, Thy law is within my heart.' Ps. 40 :8."—"Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing,"

    1. What should be our prayer concerning God's will? Matt. 6:10.

    NOTE.—"One member working in right lines will lead other members to
unite with him in making intercession for the revelation of the Holy Spirit.
There will be no confusion, because all will be in harmony with the mind
of the Spirit. The barriers separating believer from believer will be broken
down, and God's servants will speak the same things. The Lord will co-
operate with His servants. All will pray understandingly the prayer that
Christ taught His servants: 'Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth,
as it is in heaven.' Matt. 6:102—Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 251.
                                         [21 1

God's will? Ps. 103:20, 21; Heb. 1:14.

    NoTE.—"All things both in heaven and in earth declare that the great law
of life is a law of service. The infinite Father ministers to the life of every

salvation.' The same law of service is written upon all things in nature."—
Education, page 103.

   3. How did David, express Jesus' attitude to God's will? Ps. 40:8.

   Note.—"The great law of love revealed in Eden, proclaimed upon Sinai,
and- in the new covenant written in the heart, is that which binds the human
worker to the will of God. If we were left to follow our own inclinations, to
go just where our will would lead us, we should fall into Satan's ranks and
become possessors of his attributes. Therefore God confines us to His will,
which is high, and noble, and elevating. He desires that we shall patiently
and wisely take up the duties of service. The yoke of service Christ Himself
has borne in humanity. He said, 'I delight to do Thy will, 0 My God: yea,
Thy law is within My heart.' Ps. 40:8. 'I came down from heaven, not to
do Mine own will, but the will of Him that sent Me.' John 6:38. Love for
God, zeal for His glory, and love for fallen humanity, brought Jesus to earth
to suffer and to die. This was the controlling power of His life. This princi-
ple He bids us adopt."—The Desire of Ages, pages 329, 330.

                          God's Will on Earth
   4. What did Jesus come to this earth to reveal? John 5:30;
6:38, 39.

disciples, Christ said, 'As Thou hast sent Me into the world, even so have I
also sent them into the world,' to be representatives of God, to reveal His
Spirit, to manifest His character, to do His work."—The Ministry of Healing,
pages 395, 396.
    " 'My meat,' He said, 'is to do the will of Him that sent Me, and to finish
His work.' John 4:34.
   "Thus we are to serve God. He only serves who acts up to the highest
standard of obedience. All who would be sons and daughters of God must
prove themselves co-workers with God and Christ and the heavenly angels."
—Christ's Object Lessons, page 283.

                    God's Will Expressed in Law
   6. In what does the psalmist say is his delight? Ps. 119:77,174.

God's will? John 7:17; Heb. 10:10, 16, 17.

   NorE.—"The law of God is an expression ,of His very nature; it is an
embodiment of the great principle of love, and hence is the foundation of His
government in heaven and earth. If our hearts are renewed in the likeness of
God, if the divine love is implanted in the soul, will not the law of God be
carried out in the life? When the principle of love is implanted in the heart,
when man is renewed after the image of Him that created him, the new
covenant promise is fulfilled, 'I will put My laws into their hearts, and in
their minds will I write them.' And if the law is written in the heart, will it
not shape the life?"—Steps to Christ, page 65.
                      Conformity to the Will of God
-  9. What "reasonable service" is acceptable un10. God? Rom.
12:1, 2; Gal. 1:4.

   NorE.—"God calls you to separate from the world. You are not to fol-
low their practices, nor conform to them in your course of action in any
respect. Tut be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may
prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God.'
   "God calls for separation from the world. Will you obey? Will you come
out from among them, and remain separate and distinct from them? . . . If
you separate from the world in your affections, and remain free from its
contamination, escaping the corruption that is in the world through lust,
God will be your Father, He will adopt you into His family, and you will
be His heir."—Testimonies, vol. 2, pp. 43,44.
   10. What, therefore, should we always seek to understand and
to do? Eph. 5:17; 6:6.

       11. What character development does the will of God purpose
    for man? 1 Thess. 4:3.

       12. What will be the ultimate reward of conformity to the will
    of God? Matt. 7:21; 1 John 2:17.

        NorE.—"God's everlasting arm encircles the soul that turns to Him for
    aid, however feeble that soul may be. The precious things of the hills shall
    perish; but the soul that lives for God, shall abide with Him. 'The world
    passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God
    abideth forever.' 1 John 2:17. The city of God will open its golden gates
    to receive him who learned while on earth to lean on God for guidance and
    wisdom, for comfort and hope, amid loss and affliction. The songs of the
    angels will welcome him there, and for him the tree of life shall yield its
    fruit. 'The mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but My kind-
                                       [ 23]
ness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of My peace be
removed, saith the Lord that bath mercy on thee.' "—Thoughts From the
Mount of Blessing, page 148.

         "Give Us This Day Our Daily Bread"
    MEMORY VERSE: "I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if
any man eat of this bread, he shall live forever: and the bread that I will give is My
flesh, which I will give for the life of the world." John 6:51.

162-165.
    SEED THOUGHT: "When we pray, 'Give us this day our daily bread,' we ask
for others as well as ourselves. And we acknowledge that what God gives us is not for
ourselves alone. God gives to, us in trust, that we may feed the hungry. . . .
    "The prayer for daily bread includes not only food to sustain the body, but that
spiritual bread which will nourish the soul unto life everlasting."—"Thoughts From
the Mount of Blessing," pages 163, 164.

                           Dependence Upon God
  1. How are the lives of God's living creatures sustained? Ps.
104:27; 145:15, 16.

    NoTE.—"From the smallest insect to man, every living creature is daily
dependent upon His providence. . . . The mighty power that works through
all nature and sustains all things is not, as some men of science claim, merely
an all-pervading principle, an actuating energy. God is a spirit; yet He is a
personal being, for man was made in His image. As a personal being, God
has revealed Himself in His Son."—Education, pages 13-1, 132.
   2. How is God's faithfulness in caring for His own portrayed?
Ps. 23:1-6.

   NoTE.—Moffatt translates the third verse as follows: "He guides me by

present to God? Luke 11:3.
                                        [ 24 ]
   NoTE.—"We are not taught to pray for bread for many days, but for one
day, God thereby reminding us of our continual dependence upon Him.
Nor are we taught to pray for luxuries, but for bread, i.e., for necessary
food, shelter, clothing, and health. We pray also for bread for our souls, i. e.,
the grace to confess our sins and to receive God's pardon, and to persevere,
and to know God. But chiefly we pray that we may feed daily by faith on
Jesus Christ, who is our true daily bread."—J. R. Dummelow, One Volume
Bible Commentary, page 647.

                             In the Wilderness
   4. What is said of God's care for the Israelites during their
wilderness experience? Ps. 78:25; John 6:49.

    NOTE,,—"Sustained by 'the corn of heaven,' they were daily taught that,
having God's promise, they were as secure from want as if surrounded by
fields of waving grain on the fertile plains of Canaan. The manna, falling
from heaven for the sustenance of Israel, was a type of Him who came from
God to give life to the world."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 297.

   5. What did Jesus declare Himself to be? John 6:48, 51.

    NoTE.—"God had fed Israel in the wilderness with bread from heaven,
and they were still dependent upon His bounty, both for temporal food and
spiritual blessings. Both the manna and the shewbread pointed to Christ, the
living bread, who is ever in the presence of God for us."—Patriarchs and
Prophets, page 354.
  6. In what words did Jesus explain this parabolic statement?
John 6:63.
                            Life Only in Christ
   7. What is Paul's statement regarding partaking of the "one
bread"? 1 Cor. 10:17.

    NorE.—"It was Satan's purpose to bring about an eternal separation be-
tween God and man; but in Christ we become more closely united to God
than if we had never fallen."—The Desire of Ages, page 25.
    "The heart of God yearns over His earthly children with a love stronger
than death. In giving up His Son, He has poured out to us all heaven in one
gift. The Saviour's life and death and intercession, the ministry of angels,
the pleading of the Spirit, the Father working above and through all, the
unceasing interest of heavenly beings,—all are enlisted in behalf of man's
redemption."—Steps to Christ, page 24.

                           Our Spiritual Bread
  8. Besides our temporal food, what is necessary to sustain life?

   9. How vitally did Job and Jeremiah esteem the word of God?
Job 23:12; Jer. 15:16.

   10. What instruction did Jesus give concerning the true bread?
John 6:27, 35, 57.
    NoTE.—"The figure which Christ used was a familiar one to the Jews.
Moses, by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, had said, 'Man doth not live
by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the
Lord.' Deut. 8:3. And the prophet Jeremiah had written, 'Thy words were,
found, and I did eat them; and Thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing
of mine heart.' Jer. 15:16. The rabbis themselves had a saying, that the
eating of bread, in its spiritual significance, was the study of the law and the
practice of good works; and it was often said that at the Messiah's coming,
all Israel would be fed. The teaching of the prophets made plain the deep
spiritual lesson in the miracle of the loaves. This lesson Christ was seeking to
open to His hearers in the synagogue. Had they understood the Scriptures,
they would have understood His words when He said, 'I am the Bread of
Life.' Only the day before, the great multitude, when faint and weary, had
been fed by the bread which He had given. As from that bread they had
received physical strength and refreshment, so from Christ they might
receive spiritual strength unto eternal life. 'He that cometh to Me,' He said,
`shall never hunger; and he that believeth on Me shall never thirst.' "—The
Desire of Ages, page 386.
   11. What bread is promised to the overcomer? Rev. 2:17.

    NoTE.—"He whose trust is in God will with Paul be able to say, 'I can
do all things through Him that strengtheneth me.' Whatever the mistakes
or failures of the past, we may, with the help of God, rise above them."—
The Ministry of Healing, page 516.
   12. In what plain language does Jesus speak of this life-giving
bread? John 6:57, 58. (See Seed Thought.)

                             Our Daily Need
   13. What should be our daily prayer? John 6:34.

   NoTE.—"In teaching us to ask every day for what we need, both temporal
and spiritual blessings,—God has a purpose to accomplish for our good. He
would have us realize our dependence upon His constant care; for He is
seeking to draw us into communion with Himself.' In this communion with
Christ, through prayer and the study of the great and precious truths of His
word, we shall as hungry souls be fed; as those that thirst, we shall be
refreshed at the fountain of life."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing,
page 165.

our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness." 1 John 1:9.

behalf. Those to whom He has forgiven most will love Him most, and will stand nearest
His throne to praise Him for His great love and infinite sacrifice."—"Steps to Christ,"

                          Our Natural Condition
    1. What is the moral standing of all mankind? Rom. 3:23.

   Nura.—"His [man's] nature became so weakened through transgression
that it was impossible for him, in his own strength, to resist the power of
evil. He was made captive by Satan, and would have remained so forever
had not God specially interposed. It was the tempter's purpose to thwart the
divine plan in man's creation, and fill the earth with woe and desolation.• And
he would point to all this evil as the result of God's work in creating man."

                      Requirements We Must Fulfill
   4. When a sinner responds to God's invitation to "come" and
"reason together" with Him, what must he first do if he desires

   5. With what humility did Paul acknowledge his sinfulness?
1 Tim. 1:15.
                                         [ 27 3
    NoTE.—"Those who have not humbled their souls before God in acknowl-
edging their guilt, have not yet fulfilled the first condition of acceptance.. . .
   "True confession is always of a specific character, and acknowledges
particular sins. They may be of such a nature as to be brought before God
only ; they may be wrongs that should be confessed to individuals who have suf-
fered injury through them; or they may be of a public character, and should
then be as publicly confessed. But all confession should be definite and to
the point, acknowledging the very sins of which you are guilty:"—Steps to
Christ, pages 42, 43.
   6. What type of sorrow should accompany acknowledgment of
sin? 2 Cor. 7:9.

  7. What steps are included in repentance? Ezek. 18:30, 31;
Acts 26:20. Compare Acts 3:19; Rev. 2:5.

    Nom—"Repentance includes sorrow for sin, and a turning away from
it. We shall not renounce sin unless we see its sinfulness; until we turn
away from it in heart, there will be no real change in the life."—Steps to
Christ, page 26.
  8. In addition to these requirements, what other important
condition is necessary? Matt. 6:12, 14, 15.
                      The Measure of Forgiveness
   9. How many times should we forgive "our debtors"? If we do
not forgive others, what is the result? Matt. 18:22, 35.

Christ's Object Lessons, page 251.
  10. What supreme manifestation of the true spirit of forgiveness
was exemplified in Christ? Luke 23:34.

    NoTE.—"Had they known that they were putting to exquisite torture
One who had come to save the sinful race from eternal ruin, they would have
been seized with horror and remorse. But their ignorance did not remove
their guilt; for it was their privilege to know and accept Jesus as their
Saviour. . . . Jesus was earning the right to become the Advocate for man
in the Father's presence. That prayer of Christ for His enemies embraced
the world, taking in every sinner who should live, until the end of time."—
The Spirit of Prophecy, vol. 3, p. 154.
  11. How was a similar attitude demonstrated by Stephen at his
martyrdom? Acts 7:60. Compare Matt. 5:44.
                     The Blessings of Forgiveness
   1,2, How completely does God forgive our sins? 1 John 1:9.
                                     r 28 ]
   Nom.—"The law requires righteousness,—a righteous life, a perfect
character; and this man has not to give. He cannot meet the claims of God's
holy law. But Christ, coming to the earth as man, lived a holy life, and
developed a perfect character. These He offers as a free gift to all who will
receive them. His life stands for the life of men. Thus they have remis-
sion of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God. More than this,
Christ imbues men with the attributes of God. He builds up the human
character after the similitude of the divine character, a goodly fabric of
spiritual strength and beauty. Thus the very righteousness of the law is
fulfilled in the believer in Christ. God can 'be just, and the justifier of him
which believeth in Jesus.' Rom. 3:26."—The Desire of Ages, page 762.
   13. What change of heart comes with this experience? Ezek.
18:31; Ps. 51:10, margin; Matt. 5:8.

    NoTE.—"You have confessed your sins, and in heart put them away.
You have resolved to give yourself to God. Now go to Him, and ask that
He will wash away your sins, and give you a new heart. Then believe that
He does this because He has promised."—Steps to Christ, page 53.
    "The words of Jesus, 'Blessed are the pure in heart,' have a deeper mean-
ing,—not merely pure in the sense in which the world understands purity,
free from that which is sensual, pure from lust, but true in the hidden
purposes and motives of the soul, free from pride and self-seeking, humble,
unselfish, childlike."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, page 42.
    "In the new birth the heart is brought into harmony with God, as it is
brought into accord with His law. When this mighty change has taken place
in the sinner, he has passed from death unto life, from sin unto holiness, from
transgression and rebellion to obedience and loyalty."—The Great Contro-
versy, page 468.

                               Our Commission
  14. What does Luke declare as a part of the great gospel com-
mission? What are we to be in this connection? Luke 24:47, 48.
Compare Rom. 10:17.

    Nom—We can be effective "witnesses of these things" only as we are able
to testify of our own personal experience in repentance that results in par-
don, cleansing from sin, and a new heart.


                     Lesson 10, for March 11, 1950

              "Lead Us Not Into Temptation"
    MEMORY VERSE: "There bath ' no temptation taken you but such as is com-
mon to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye
are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able
to bear it." 1 Cor. 10:13.

    SEED THOUGHT: "The trials of life are God's workmen, to remove the impuri-
ties and roughness from our character. Their hewing, squaring, and chiseling, their
burnishing and polishing, is a painful process, it is hard to be pressed down to the
grinding wheel. But the stone is brought forth prepared to fill its place in the heavenly
temple. Upon, no useless material does the Master bestow such careful, thorough
work. Only His precious stones are polished after the similitude of a palace."—

                                    Temptation
  1. How does the Saviour tell us to continue His model prayer?
Matt. 6:13, first part.

   NorE.—"Temptation is enticement to sin, and this does not proceed from
God, but from Satan, and from the evil of our own hearts."—Thoughts
From the Mount of Blessing, page 170.
    The verb and the noun translated to tempt and temptation, in the English
Bible, properly go back to a root meaning "to make an experience of," "to
search into," or "to attempt." It later acquired the meaning of to try one
intentionally with the purpose of discovering what of good or of bad, of
strength or of weakness, was resident in the one tested. The one who did the
sifting may have been aware of the true character of the one tested, but
wished to have the tested one himself realize his own condition. This root
also gathered to itself the force of to put to the proof. In all cases, being
proved or tested, the ones tried will stand out to be what they are. Nothing
in the root word itself requires that it should mean to make a test with
the idea of entangling the tested one in sin. Whether the vexation is for a
good purpose or a bad one, will depend on the nature of the one who gives
the trial. This is the criterion the Bible student should apply in each use
of the word, in order to get the correct meaning required.
    2. In the first temptation recorded, on what point were our
first parents tested? Gen. 3:1-5, 12, 13.

    NcrrE.—"Satan exulted in his success. He had tempted the woman to dis-
trust God's love, to doubt His wisdom, and to transgress His law, and through
her he had caused the overthrow of Adam."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
page 57.
                            Jesus and Temptation
   3. Where the "first man Adam" failed, how did the last Adam
succeed? Matt. 4:3, 4.

   NOTE.—"In this declaration, and also by His example, Christ showed that
wanting temporal food was a much less calamity than meeting the disap-
probation of God.
                                         [ 30 ]
   "In becoming man's substitute, and conquering where man had been
vanquished, Christ was not to manifest His divine power to relieve His own
suffering, for fallen man could work no miracles in order to save himself
from pain, and Christ as his representative, was to bear His trials as a man,
leaving an example of perfect faith and trust in His heavenly Father."—The
Spirit of Prophecy, vol. 2, pp. 92, 93.

                   Two Babylon and Temptation

   4. In ancient Babylon how were Daniel and his companions
tested? Dan. 1:5-8.

    NOTE.—"Strict compliance with the requirements of Heaven brings tem-
poral as well as spiritual blessings. Unwavering in his allegiance to God, un-
yielding in his mastery of self, Daniel, by his noble dignity and unswerving
integrity, while yet a young man, won the 'favor and tender love' (Dan. 1:9)
of the heathen officer in whose charge he had been placed."—Prophets and
Kings, page 546.
5. How is modern Babylon described by John the revelator?
What call does the Lord make to us? Rev. 18:3, 4.

   NOTE.—"As in the days of Noah and Lot, there must be a marked separa-
tion from sin and sinners. There can be no compromise between God and
the world, no turning back to secure earthly treasures. 'Ye cannot serve
God and mammon.' Matt. 6:24."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 167.
  6. How strong will be the deceptive powers of Satan's agents?
Matt. 24:24.

    NOTE.—"If there was ever a people in need of constantly increasing light
from heaven, it is the people that, in this time of peril, God has called to be
the depositaries of His holy law, and to vindicate His character before the
world. Those to whom has been committed a trust so sacred must be spiritu-
alized, elevated, vitalized, by the truths they profess to believe."—Testi-
monies, vol. 5, p. 746.
  7. In view of the test that is before us, to what injunction of the
Lord should we give special heed? Luke 22:46; Mark 14:38.

    NoTE.—"Temptation may be all around us, but this does not make it
necessary that we should enter into temptation. The truth is worth every-
thing."—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 101.
    "Watch against the stealthy approach of the enemy, watch against old
habits and natural inclinations, lest they assert themselves; force them back,
and watch. Watch the thoughts, watch the plans, lest they become self-
centered. Watch over the souls whom Christ has purchased with His own
blood. Watch for opportunities to do them good."—Testimonies, vol. 6,
p. 410.

                     Help in Our Hour of Need
   10. During our temptation of what can we be certain? 1 Cor.
10:13. Compare Heb. 13:5, last part.

    NOTE.—"The only safeguard against evil is the indwelling of Christ in
the heart through faith in His righteousness. . . . Christ will never abandon
the soul for whom He has died. The soul may leave Him, and be overwhelmed
with temptation; but Christ can never turn from one for whom He has paid
the ransom of His own life."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing,
page 172.
  11. What assurance of divine help is given to the Christian?
Heb. 2:18; 4:15.

    NoTE.—"Christ alone had experience in all the sorrows and temptations
that befall human beings. Never another of woman born was so fiercely
beset by temptation; never another bore so heavy a burden of the world's
sin and pain. Never was there another whose sympathies were so broad or
so tender. A sharer in all the experiences of humanity, he could feel not only
for, but with, every burdened and tempted and struggling one."—Education,
page 78.
    12. How certain may we be of divine help in the future "hour
of temptation"? Heb. 4:16; Rev. 3:10.

    NOTE.—"His intercession is that of a pierced and broken body, of a spot-
less life. The wounded hands, the pierced side, the marred feet, plead for
fallen man, whose redemption was purchased at such infinite cost."—The
Great Controversy, page 416.
    "He would sooner send every angel out of heaven to protect His people,
than leave one soul that trusts in Him to be overcome by Satan."—Ibid.,
page 560.
   13. What promise is made to the overcomer? James 1:12.

           Thirteenth Sabbath Offering Overflow

Pakistan, and a small publishing plant at Chuharkana, in
Pakistan.

   1. Quite distinct from temptation comes the second part of
verse 13 of Matthew 6. HoW is this expressed? Matt. 6:13, second
part.
   NOTE.—"Live in contact, with the living Christ, and He will hold you

has to us, and you are secure; that love is a fortress impregnable to all the
delusions and assaults of Satan."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing,
page 173.
   2. What assurance is given for the saints when in danger? Ps.
34:7.     •
   NoTE.—"God commissions His angels to save His chosen ones from calam-
ity, to guard them from the pestilence that walketh in darkness,' and 'the

with men as a man speaketh with a friend, and led them to places of
security."—Acts of the Apostles, page 153.

divinely led and protected? 1 Kings 17:3, 4, 13-16.

    NOTE.—"God's faithful servants were not toiling alone. While 'princi-
palities and powers and wicked spirits in high places' were leagued against
them, the Lord did not forsake His people. Could their eyes have been
opened, they would have seen as marked evidence of divine presence and aid
as was granted to a prophet of old. . . . Thus did angels guard the workers
in the cause of the Reformation."—The Great Controversy, page 208.

   7. What promise is made to those who love the Lord? Ps. 97:10.

    NOTE.—As part of a comment on this text, we read: "We should now be

war is stirring the nations from one end of the earth to the other. But in the
midst of the time of trouble that is coming,—a time of trouble such as has not
been since there was a nation,—God's chosen people will stand unmoved.
Satan and his host cannot destroy them; for angels that excel in strength will
protect them."—Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 17.

where were the victorious people of God seen by the apostle John?
Rev. 15:2-4.

   NoTE.—"They have seen the earth wasted with famine and pestilence,
the sun having power to scorch men with great heat, and they themselves
have endured suffering, hunger, and thirst. . . . In all ages the Saviour's
chosen have been educated and disciplined in the school of trial. They walked
in narrow paths on earth ; they were purified in the furnace of affliction.
For Jesus' sake they endured opposition, hatred, calumny. They followed
Him through conflicts sore. . . . Having been partakers of Christ's suf-
fering, they are fitted to be partakers with Him of His glory."—The Great
Controversy, pages 649, 650.

12:11.

Satan and his hosts because they cannot force him to submit to their control.
It is the rage of a vanquished foe. Every martyr of Jesus has died a conqueror."
—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 77.
  13. What assurance does the apostle Peter give of God's knowl-
edge and power? 2 Peter 2:9.

    NOTE.—"To all who are reaching out to feel the guiding hand of God,
the moment of greatest discouragement is the time when divine help is
nearest. They will look back with thankfulness upon the darkest part of
their way. 'The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly.' From every temp-
tation and every trial He will bring them forth with firmer faith and a
richer experience."—The Desire of Ages, page 528.
   14. What cheering promises of complete deliverance from evil
are given to us? Gal. 1:4; 2 Cor. 1:10. Compare Heb. 11:39, 40;

`the redemption of the purchased possession.' The earth originally given to
man as his kingdom, betrayed by him into the hands of Satan, and so long
held by the mighty foe, has been brought back by the great plan of redemp-
tion. All that was lost by sin has been restored."—The Great Controversy,

  8. What is the wonderful outworking of this great power that

of God. When we have asked for His blessing, we should believe that we
receive it, and thank Him that we have received it. Then we are to go about
our duties, assured that the blessing will be realized when we need it most.
When we have learned to do this, we shall know that our prayers are
answered. God will do for us 'exceeding abundantly,' according to the riches
of His glory,' and 'the working of His mighty power.' "—The Desire of Ages,
page 200.

    NorE.—"When we are able to comprehend the character of God, as did
Moses, we too shall make haste to bow in adoration and praise. The wisdom
of God alone can unfold the mysteries of the plan of salvation. . . . The
wisdom of God is indispensable. Miss what you may in the line of worldly
attainments, but you must have faith in the pardon brought to you at in-
finite cost, or all the wisdom attained on earth will perish with you."—
Counsels to Teachers, page 30.
   10. Where can we see evidences of this glory? Ps. 19:1-4.

    NorE.—We should ever remember that "this God is our God for ever
and ever."

                         Longing for His Glory
   12. How does Paul, who was caught up to the third heaven,
compare the world that now is with the world to come? 1 Cor.
2:9, 10; 13:12.

   NOTE.—"The people of God are privileged to hold open communion with
the Father and the Son. Now we see through a glass, darkly.' We behold
the image of God reflected, as in a mirror, in the works of nature and in His
dealings with men; but then we shall see Him face to face, without a dim-
ming veil between. We shall stand in His presence, and behold the glory of
His countenance."—The Great Controversy, pages 676, 677.
   "There is no disappointment, no sorrow, no sin, no one who shall say, I
am sick; there are no burial trains, no mourning, no death, no partings, no
broken hearts; but Jesus is there, peace is there."—Thoughts From the
Mount of Blessing, page 33.
   13. With what brief description of the new earth do the. Scrip-
tures conclude? Rev. 21:10, 11, 23.

    NoTE.—"The tree of life yields its fruit every month, and the leaves of
the tree are for the service of the nations. There are ever-flowing streams,
clear as crystal, and beside them waving trees cast their shadows upon the
paths prepared for the ransomed of the Lord. There the wide-spreading
plains swell into hills of beauty, and the mountains of God rear their lofty
summits. On those peaceful plains, beside those living streams, God's people,
so long pilgrims and wanderers, shall find a home."—The Great Controversy,
page 675.

                   The Privilege of Prayer
       Prayer is the opening of the heart to God as to a friend. Not
    that it is necessary, in order to make known to God what we are,
    but in order to enable us to receive Him. Prayer does not bring
    God down to us, but brings us up to Him.
       When Jesus was upon the earth, He taught His disciples how to
    pray. He directed them to present their daily needs before God,
    and to cast all their care upon Him. And the assurance He gave
    them that their petitions should be heard, is assurance also to us.
       Jesus Himself, while He dwelt among men, was often in prayer.
    Our Saviour identified Himself with our needs and weakness, in
    that He became a suppliant, a petitioner, seeking from His Father
    fresh supplies of strength, that He might come forth braced for
    duty and trial. He is our example in all things. He is a brother
    in our infirmities, "in all points tempted like as we are;" but as the
    Sinless One, His nature recoiled from evil; He endured struggles
    and torture of soul in a world of sin. His humanity made prayer
    a necessity and a privilege. He found comfort and joy in com-
    munion with His Father. And if the Saviour of men, the Son of
    God, felt the need of prayer, how much more should feeble, sinful
    mortals feel the necessity of fervent, constant prayer.
       Our heavenly Father waits to bestow upon us the fullness of His
    blessing. It is our privilege to drink largely at the fountain of
    boundless love. What a wonder it is that we pray so little! . . .
       Why should the sons and daughters of God be reluctant to pray,
    when prayer is the key in the hand of faith to unlock heaven's
    storehouse, where are treasured the boundless resources of Omnipo-
    tence?—Steps to Christ, pages 97-99.

           THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
                          Southern Asia Division—March 25
   What a wonderful source of financial help our world-wide Sabbath
schools are! In the Southern Asia Division alone former Thirteenth Sabbath
overflows have contributed generously to such worthy objectives as the
mission quarters at Rawalpindi, a mission station in Assam, a medical insti-
tution at Rangoon, besides modest church buildings and workers' quarters.
   The overflow of the coming Thirteenth Sabbath Offering on March 25 is
to be devoted to the establishment of a new hospital in Karachi, the capital
of the new Pakistan Dominion, and for setting up a small well-equipped
publishing plant at Chuharkana in this same field, where there is a growing
demand for gospel and health literature in the Urdu language. It is hoped
that a large overflow will be realized through the generous gifts of Sabbath
school members throughout the world, that these two needs may be met in
Pakistan.
   The fourth quarter of 1947 we gave to the Southern Asia field a fine
overflow of $40,084.08, which went to the Rangoon hospital. Won't you
make a sacrificial gift double your usual Thirteenth Sabbath Offering?
