                                EPHESIANS

                                     Foreword
     Ephesus was the capital city of Asia Minor, one of the richest of all the provinces
of the world empire of Rome. It was the center of wealth, luxury, and idolatry for
regions beyond the confines of its province. Here was the temple of Diana, one of the
Seven Wonders of the World of that time. The apostle Paul preached the goSpel of
Christ in few places more opposed to its spirit than was the ungodly atmosphere of
Ephesus. Here he labored "by the space of three years." Acts 20:31. In no, other
Gentile city had he worked so continuously save in Antioch. His address to the elders
of the church of Ephesus (verses 18-35) testifies to the diligence and devotion of his
labor for the people of that great city.
     The epistle to the Ephesians, which was undoubtedly sent "to the faithful in Christ
Jesus" of other churches under Paul's care, is a marvelous revelation of the grace of
God to man. The overture of praise given in verses 3 to 14 of the first chapter is
perhaps unsurpassed in all inspired literature. Here, standing between the eternity of
the past and the eternity of the future, Paul passes on to us his heavenly vision of the
plan of divine love for , the redemption of a sinful world formed before its creation.
Here is revealed the unspeakable joy—joy here and now, and throughout the ,unend-
ing ages to come—of those who accept of this plan
     This letter of Paul, which has been of comfort to the children of God from the time
it was written by the aged Christian warrior in a prison at Rome until now, is of par-
ticular value to every member of the church of God in this the most crucial hour of
the church's history.


                        Lesson 1, for April 7, 1945
                          A Heaven on Earth
     LESSON SCRIPTURE: Ephesians 1:1-14.
     MEMORY VERSE: "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ." Eph. 1:3.
     STUDY HELP: "Prophets and Kings," pages 311-321.
     SEED THOUGHT: "Heaven is to begin on this earth. When the Lord's people
are filled with meekness and tenderness, they will realize that His banner over them
is love, and His fruit will be sweet to their taste. They will make a heaven below in
which to prepare for heaven above."—"Testimonies," vol. 7, p. 131.

                             Salutation and Praise
     1. By whom was the epistle to the Ephesians written? To whom
was it addressed? Eph. 1:1.
    NoTE.—"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ." It appears that, beginniiii with
apostleship to the Gentile world, Saul used the name of Paul, which had been
given him as a Roman citizen, born in Tarsus. It was naturally less objection-
able to those to whom he had been sent than his Hebrew name Saul. Con-
formity to the customs of those for whom he labored where principle was not
involved, such as the use of his Gentile name, is perhaps one of Paul's "all things
to all men, that I might by all means save some." 1 Cor. 9:22. This tactfulness,
together with his gentleness (1 Thess. 2: 7 ) ; his humility (1 Cor. 2:1-5) ;
                                          f3 1
his great zeal (1 Cor. 9:16; Rom. 9:3) are lessons for each of Christ's dis-
ciples today.
    "To the saints." A saint is one who is faithful in his allegiance to God.
Like Paul, he steadfastly seeks perfection. See Phil. 3:9-14.
    "Faithful in Christ Jesus." This expression justifies every true follower
of the Saviour in a personal application of this epistle.
     2. What benediction does the writer pronounce upon those to
whom he writes? Eph. 1:2.
    NorE.—Grace is defined as "divine unmerited favor toward man ; the
mercy of God, as distinguished from His justice."—Webster. "The only power
that can create or perpetuate true peace is the grace of Christ. When this is
implanted in the heart, it will cast out the evil passions that cause strife and
dissension."—The Desire of Ages, page 305.
     3. With what has God blessed us? Verse 3.
    NOTE.—Man's blessing of God and God's blessing of man are very different.
He blesses us with life and salvation; we bless, or praise Him (as in Rev. 5:12
and 1 Peter 1:3) by the true spirit of gratitude. He "bath blessed us . . . in
heavenly places in Christ." We may on this earth now enjoy the very atmos-
phere of heaven.
     4. In whom did God choose us? When was this choice made,
and for what purpose? Eph. 1:4.
    5. Unto what has God chosen us? Verse 5.
                  Accepted in the Beloved
    6. Through what are we acceptable to God? Verse 6.
     7. Through the riches of God's grace, what further blessings do
we receive? Verse 7.
    NOTE.—"As you read the promises, remember they are the expression of
unutterable love and pity. The great heart of Infinite Love is drawn toward
the sinner with boundless compassion. 'We have redemption through His
blood, the forgiveness of sins.' Yes, only believe that God is your helper. He
wants to restore His moral image in man. As you draw near to Him with
confession and repentance, He will draw near to you with mercy and forgive-
ness."—Steps to Christ, page 60.
     8. How freely is God's grace manifested toward us? Verse 8.
    NOTE.—God abounds in all good things. His supply is infinite. If sin
abounds, much more so do His grace and forgiving love. Rom. 5:20. His
grace is abundant (2 Cor. 4:15) ; He abundantly pardons (Isa. 55:7). Our
need may be inexpressibly great, but He can do "exceeding abundantly" above
all thought or asking (Eph. 3:20), and though God's love is infinite and His
resources of aid are exhaustless, He deals with us in "wisdom and prudence,"
giving us everything that is best for us.
     9. What did it please God to make known to man? Eph. 1:9.
                 Gathered Together in Christ
  10. What is this mystery which now is "made known unto us"?
Col. 1:27.
                             14 1
    NorE.—"Souls that have borne the likeness of Satan, have been trans-
formed into the image of God. This change is itself the miracle of miracles. A
change wrought by the word, it is one of the deepest mysteries of the word.
We cannot understand it; we can only believe, as declared by the Scriptures,
it is 'Christ in you, the hope of glory.'
    "A knowledge of this mystery furnishes a key to every other. It opens to
the soul the treasures of the universe, the possibilities of infinite development."
—Education, page 172.
    11. What does Paul say regarding this mysterious experience in
his own life? Gal. 2:20.
     NOTE.—"Paul realized that his sufficiency was not in himself, but in the
presence of the Holy Spirit, whose gracious influence filled his heart, bringing
every thought into subjection to Christ. . . . Self was hidden; Christ was
 revealed and exalted."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 251.
    12. How completely will God redeem and restore that which has
 been lost through sin? Eph. 1:10.
     NOTE.—Before the foundation of this world God had made provision
against a final triumph of sin by giving His own Son to die for sinners. Verse
4. And, in "the fullness of times," peace and perfection shall again abound
 throughout a redeemed universe.
     13. In the gathering together of "all things in Christ," what are
 the faithful in Christ Jesus to receive, and why? Verses 11, 12.
   14. What are the steps in obtaining salvation? Verse 13.
    Answer: Hearing, believing, and being "sealed with that Holy Spirit of
promise."
   15. What does the Holy Spirit become to the saints while they
await redemption? Verse 14.
    NorE.—An earnest is "something given beforehand as a pledge; a token of
what is to come."—Webster.
  "The Son of God proposed to come to this earth to pay the penalty of sin,
and thus not only redeem man, but recover the dominion forfeited. It is of
this restoration that Micah prophesied when he said, '0 Tower of the flock,
the stronghold of the daughter of Zion, unto Thee shall it come, even the
first dominion.' The apostle Paul has referred to it as 'the redemption of the
purchased possession.' "—Prophets and Kings, page 682.


                        Lesson 2, for April 14, 1945
                      A Prayer for the Church
     LESSON SCRIPTURE: Ephesians 1:15-23.
     MEMORY VERSE: "That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of
 glory, may give unto you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of
 Him." Eph. 1:17.
     STUDY HELP: "Testimonies," vol. 8, pp. 19-23.
     SEED THOUGHT: "This treasure, which Christ esteems as precious above all
 estimate, is 'the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints.' The disciples of
                                           [6 1
Christ are called His jewels, His precious and peculiar treasure. He says: 'They
shall be as the stones of a crown.' I will make a man more precious than fine gold;
even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir.' Christ looks upon His people in their
purity and perfection as the reward of all His sufferings."—"Thoughts From the
Mount of Blessing," page 1.34.

                    Paul's Relation to His Brethren
     1. Of what characteristics of the Ephesians had Paul heard?
Eph. 1:15.
    Nora.—"The strongest bond of union between God's children is Christ
Jesus." When we trust in Christ, when the love in our hearts "is the love which
is begotten by the life of the Lord Jesus, and when He becomes the bond
between the regenerated soul and all others, the love abides; and this was the
love that was in these Christians whom Paul is addressing."—M. C. Wilcox,
Studies in Ephesians, page 32.
     2. How constant were the apostle's prayers of thankfulness for
his brethren? Verse 16.
    NOTE.—Paul's constant care for his brethren is an example to every be-
liever.
     3. How do we know we have passed from death unto life?
1 John 3:14, 16.
    NOTE.—"During every hour of Christ's sojourn upon the earth, the love of
God was flowing from Him in irrepressible streams. All who are imbued with
His Spirit will love as He loved. The very principle that actuated Christ will
actuate them in all their dealing one with another. This love is the evidence of
their discipleship."—The Desire of Ages, page 678.
               Paul's Prayer for Their Enlightenment
      4. What did Paul ask God to give to his brethren? Eph. 1:17.
     NOTE.—One of the best and greatest gifts of God to man is "the Spirit of
wisdom and revelation." God has revealed His love and wisdom to us through
His Holy Word. As we earnestly and prayerfully study it, the eyes of our
understanding are enlightened and our "knowledge of Him" steadily grows.
Spiritual things are "spiritually discerned." 1 Cor. 2:14.
      5. What knowledge is given the enlightened mind and heart?
Eph. 1:18, 19, first part.
     NOTE.—Three things are to be known by the enlightened mind and heart:
1. "The hope of His calling." It saves us now and gives us a steadfast hope of
an eternal life in a perfect world. It makes Christ, the "all in all" in every
affair of this life. 2. "The riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints."
God the Father loves His children with a love that we can in no way compre-
hend, save through His enlightening Spirit. He reckons Himself rich in the
affection and service of His saints. We are His inheritance purchased by the
life of His cli-ar Son. 3. "The exceeding greatness of His power to usward-who
believe." It is the power of His life; it is the power by which_sin is 2forgiven;
it is the power by which clean hearts are created within us and is laN7 of love
is written therein.
    "Witte true that God spared not His Son for our •SaRration. and has
sealeil us       the seal of His Spirit, if He chose us before-the world's founda-
                                         [6I
tions to be His saints, He must set upon those saints an infinite value. We may
despise ourselves; but He thinks great things of us."—Findlay, The Epistle to
the Ephesians, page 73.          •                             •
     6. What assurance has God given that He will use His mighty
power in our behalf? What example of this power is cited? Verse
19, last part, 20, first part.
     NoTE.—"This same resurrection power is that which gives life to the soul
`dead in trespasses and sins.' That spirit of life in Christ Jesus, 'the power of
His resurrection,' sets men 'free from the law of sin and death.' The dominion
of evil is broken, and through faith the soul is kept from sin. He who opens
his heart to the Spirit of Christ becomes a partaker of that mighty power
which shall bring forth his body from the grave."—The Desire of Ages, pages
209, 210.
                         The Exaltation of Christ
      7. Where did the Father place His Son after His resurrection?
 Verse 20, last part.
     NOTE.—"Look at Jesus where He was—the poor, tortured, wounded body,
 slain by our sins, lying cold and still in Joseph's grave: then lift up your eyes
 and see Him where He is—enthroned in the worship and wonder of heaven!
 Measure by that distance, by the sweep and lift of that almighty Arm, the
 strength of the forces engaged to your salvation, the might of the powers at
 work through the ages for the redemption of humanity."—Findlay, The Epistle
 to the Ephesians, pages 77, 78.
      8. How had Christ humbled Himself because of His love for lost
 man? Phil. 2:5-8.
     NoTt.—"Jesus, the brightness of the Father's glory, thought 'it not a thing
 to be grasped to be on an equality with God, but emptied Himself, taking the
 form of a servant.' Through all the lowly experiences of life He consented to
 pass, walking among the children of men, not as a king, to demand homage,
 but as one whose mission it was to serve others. There was in His manner no
 taint of bigotry, no cold austerity. The world's Redeemer had a greater than
 angelic nature, yet united with His divine majesty were meekness and humility
 that attracted all to Himself."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, pages
29, 30.
      9. How greatly is Christ exalted? Eph. 1:21.
   10. How complete is Christ's authority? Verse 22, first part.
    11. What is Christ's relation to the church? Verse 22, last part, 23.
    NOTE.—"The church is built upon Christ as its foundation; it is to obey
 Christ as its head. . . . Upon no finite being can we depend for guidance."—
 The Desire of Ages, page 414.
    12. Because of the power which had been given Him, what did
 Christ command His followers to do? Matt. 28:18-20.
    NOTE.—"Not upon the ordained minister only rests the responsibility of
 going forth to fulfill this commission. Every one who has received Christ is
 called to work for the salvation of his fellow men. . . ..Hundreds, yea, thou-
 sands, who have heard the message of salvation, are still idlers in the market
                                       E71
place, when they might be engaged in some line of active service. . . . Long
has God waited for the spirit of service to take possession of the whole church,
so that every one shall be working for Him•according to his ability."—The
Acts of the Apostles, pages 110, 111.


                       Lesson 3, for April 21, 1945
                    Salvation the Gift of God
     LESSON SCRIPTURE: Ephesians 2 : 1-10.
     MEMORY VERSE: "For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of
yourselves: it is the gift of God." Eph. 2:8.
     STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pages 342-348.
     SEED THOUGHT: "Not because we see or feel that God hears us are we to
believe. We are to trust in His promises. When we come to Him in faith, every
petition enters the heart of God. When we have asked for His blessing, we should
believe that we receive it, and thank Him that we have received it. Then we are to go
about our duties, assured that the blessing will be realized when we need it most.
When we have learned to do this, we shall know that our prayers are answered. God
will do for us 'exceeding abundantly,' according to the riches of His glory,' and 'the
working of His mighty power.' "—"The Desire of Ages," page 200.

                        "You Hath He Quickened"
     1. What has God done for those who believe in Christ? Eph. 2:1.
    NoTE.—This verse is rendered in the American Revised Version as follows:
"You did He make alive, when ye were dead through your trespasses and
sins." This takes our minds back to Ephesians 1:20. Our assurance of being
made alive from death in sin is in the resurrection of Jesus.
     2. Whom do the unconverted follow? Eph. 2:2, 3.
     3. What was the Christian's condition before he was reconciled
to God? Rom. 3:23.
    NoTE.—"God is the fountain of life; and when one chooses the service
of sin, he separates from God, and thus cuts himself off from life. He is 'alien-
ated from the life of God.' "—The Desire of Ages, pages 763, 764.
     4. In what is God rich, and how great is His love? By what are
we saved? Eph. 2:4, 5.
    NOTE.—"Through Jesus, God's mercy was manifested to men; but mercy
does not set aside justice. The law reveals the attributes of God's character,
and not a jot or tittle of it could be changed to meet man in his fallen condi-
tion. God did not change His law, but He sacrificed Himself, in Christ, for
man's redemption. 'God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto Himself.' "—
The Desire of Ages, page 762.
             The Exalted Position of the Righteous
   5. To how many is the light and joy of this salvation given?
John 1:9, 12.
   6. What great honor does God give to those whom He raises
from spiritual death? Eph. 2:6.
    NoTE.—It is to be observed that the present or past tense is used almost
continuously in the scriptures here being studied. We are saved by grace, and
made to sit in heavenly places now. "Transformation of character is the testi-
mony to the world of an indwelling Christ. The Spirit of God produces a new
life in the soul, bringing the thoughts and desires into obedience to the will of
Christ; and the inward man is renewed in the image of God."—Prophets and
Kings, page 233.
      7. What will be shown by the redeemed throughout the eternal
ages? Verse 7.
    NOTE.—"The exaltation of the redeemed will be an eternal testimony to
God's mercy. . . . Through Christ's redeeming work the government of God
stands justified. The Omnipotent One is made known as the God of love. . • .
Sin can never again enter the universe. Through eternal ages all are secure from
apostasy. By love's self-sacrifice, the inhabitants of earth and heaven are
bound to their Creator in bonds of indissoluble union. The work of redemp-
tion will be complete."—The Desire of Ages, page 26.
      8. How only may man comprehend the work of redemption?
1 Cor. 2:9-12.
    NoTE.—"God's wonderful purpose of grace, the mystery of redeeming love,
is the theme into which 'angels desire to look,' and it will be their study
throughout endless ages. Both the redeemed and the unfallen beings will find
in the cross of Christ their science and their song."—The Desire of Ages,
 pages 19, 20.
                    God's Plan for Man's Salvation
     9. By what and through what are sinners saved? Eph. 2:8.
    NOTE.—"Mercy," "love," "kindness," "grace," "gift;" this constellation of
words occurring in the scriptures of this lesson but faintly expresses the love
of God in His gospel of salvation.
   10. Why is this salvation not of works? Verse 9, first part; Gal.
2:16.
    NOTE.—"Our own works can never purchase salvation."—The Desire of
Ages, page 280.
   11. What is the usual result of an unregenerate man's successful
moral battle? Eph. 2:9, last part.
    NOTE.—When man does not recognize his inability of himself to do any
good thing, his normal reaction to success in doing right is to boast thereof, to
speak of his own good deeds. He has either lost sight of, or has never known,
the truth of the Saviour's words, "Without Me ye can do nothing," or of Paul's
faith expressed when he said, "I can do all things through Christ which
strengtheneth me."
   12. By whose workmanship is the Christian created, and for what
purpose? Verse 10; Ps. 51:10.
    NoTE.—We can continue the good works to which we are "before or-
dained" only by abiding in Christ, the Vine. John 15:1-6.
    "Good works can never purchase salvation, but they are an evidence of the
faith that acts by love and pUrifies the soul. And though the eternal reward is
                                       [91
not bestowed because of our merit, yet it will be in proportion to the work that
has been done through the grace of Christ."—The Desire of Ages, page 314.
   13. What is the relation of faith and works to each other? James
2:17-26.
    NoTE.—"God's children are not only to pray in faith, but to work with
diligent and provident care. They encounter many difficulties, and often
hinder the working of Providence in their behalf, because they regard prudence
and painstaking effort as having little to do with religion. Nehemiah did not
regard his duty done when he had wept and prayed before the Lord. He
united his petitions with holy endeavor, putting forth earnest, prayerful efforts
for the success of the enterprise in which he was engaged. Careful consider-
ation and well-matured plans are as essential to the carrying forward of sacred
enterprises today as in the time of the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls."—
Prophets and Kings, pages 633, 634.

392-395) ; "The Acts of the Apostles," pages 19-21.
     SEED THOUGHT: "The gospel is a message of peace. Christianity is a system,
which, received and obeyed, would spread peace, harmony, and happiness throughout
the earth. The religion of Christ will unite in close brotherhood all who accept its teach-
ings."—"The Great Controversy," page 47.

                       Reconciled to God
    1. What did Paul ask the Ephesians to remember? Eph. 2:11.
   2. Describe the condition of those who are unacquainted with
Christ. Verse 12.
      3. What is the result of being in Christ? Verse 13.
   NOTE.—"Through       the power of Christ men and women have broken the
chains of sinful habit. They have renounced selfishness. . . . Souls that have
borne the likeness of Satan have become transformed into the image of God.
This change is in itself the miracle of miracles. A change wrought by the word,
it is one of the deepest mysteries of the word. We cannot understand it; we
can only believe, as declared by the Scriptures, it is 'Christ in you, the hope of
glory.'"—The Acts of the Apostles, page 476.
                  United in Christ Jesus

    6. How are men' of all nations and religious beliefs united?
Verse 14, last part, 15, 16; Gal. 3:28.
    NoTE.—"Christ came to break down every wall of partition. He came to
show that His gift of mercy and love is as unconfined as the air, the light, or
the showers of rain that refresh the earth. The life of Christ established a
religion in which there is no caste, a religion by which Jew and Gentile, free
and bond, are linked in a common brotherhood, equal before. God."—Testi-
monies, vol. 9, pp. 190, 191.
     7. What is meant by "the law of commandments contained in
ordinances"? Col. 2:14-16.
    NoTE.—"The ceremonial system was made up of symbols pointing to
Christ, to His sacrifice and His priesthood. This ritual law, with its sacrifices
and ordinances, was to be performed' by the Hebrews until type met antitype
in the death of Christ, the Lamb of God,that taketh away the sin of the world.
Then all the sacrificial offerings were to cease."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
page 365.
    8. What did Christ ask for His disciples, and for what purpose?
Are we included in this prayer? John 17:21-23.
   NoTE.—"Strive earnestly for unity. Pray for it, work for it. . . . Crucify
self; esteem others better than yourselves. Thus you will be brought into
oneness with Christ. . . . The world needs to see worked out before it the
miracle that binds the hearts of God's people together in Christian love. It
needs to see the Lord's people sitting together in heavenly places in Christ."—
Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 188.
                     Framed 10. the Cornerstone
    9. What work did Christ do for all men? Eph. 2:16, 17.
   NoTE.—"By His life and His death, Christ has achieved even more than
recovery from the ruin wrought through sin. It was Satan's purpose to bring
about an eternal separation between God and man; but in Christ we become
more closely united to God than if we had never fallen. In taking our nature,
the Saviour has bound Himself to humanity by a tie that is never, to be
broken."—The Desire of Ages, page 25.
   10. Through Christ how closely may all men become united?
Verses 18, 19; 1 Cor. 12:13.
    H. Upon what foundation is the church of God built? In whoth
 is it fitted together? Eph. 2:20, 21.
     NOTE.—"Christ, the true foundation, is a living stone; His life is imparted
 to all that are built upon Him. . . . The stones become one with the founda-
 tion; for a common life dwells in all. That building no tempest can over-
 throw."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, page 216.
    12. What is the object of this building? Verse 22..

                         Lesson 5, for May 5, 1945
                   God's Care for His Church
     LESSON SCRIPTURE: Ephesians 3:1-13.
     MEMORY VERSE: "For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all
the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ." 1 Cor.
12:12.
     STUDY HELP: "The Acts of the Apostles," pages 120-122.
     SEED THOUGHT: "Jesus says, 'Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end
of the world.' . . . We must always take comfort and hope as we think of this. . . .
He thinks of us individually, and knows our every necessity. . . I entreat you to
have courage in the Lord. Divine strength is ours; and let us talk courage and strength
and faith. Read the third chapter of Ephesians. Practice the instruction given. Bear
a living testimony for God under all circumstances."—"Testimonies to Ministers,"
page 391.
                           The Mystery of Christ
      1. Whose prisoner was Paul, and in whose behalf?. Eph. 3:1.
     NoTE.—Under all circumstances Paul reckoned himself as being Christ's
 very own. Said he to the Corinthians, "We pray you in Christ's stead, be ye
 reconciled to God." And to the Galatians he said: "The life which I now live
in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God." "Paul's was a life of intense
and varied activities. . . . But in all the busy activity of his life, he never
lost sight of the one great purpose,—to press toward the mark of his high
calling."—Gospel Workers, pages 58, 59.
      2. What had been given to Paul, and for whom was it given?
Verse 2.
     NOTE.—Paul here indicates that the Ephesians, who were Gentiles, had
already heard of his commission to preach to them the grace of God.
      3. What had been revealed to Paul? Verse 3; Col. 1:27.
      4. By whom did Paul receive the gospel? Gal. 1:11, 12.
     NOTE.—"He wrote, not in hesitancy and doubt, but with the assurance of
settled conviction and absolute knowledge. He clearly outlined the difference-
between being taught by man and receiving instruction direct from Christ.
. . . Not from men, but from the highest Authority in heaven, had he received
his commission."—The Acts of the Apostles, pages 386, 387.
      5. When his brethren had read what Paul wrote, what could
they understand? Eph. 3:4.
     NOTE.—Paul here again speaks of "the mystery of Christ." The doctrine
of the new birth, of righteousness by faith, was indeed a mystery to the heathen
world as well as to the Jews. The indwelling of Christ through the Holy Spirit
is in truth the mystery of the gospel. Gal. 2:20.
      6. How was a fuller revelation of the saving grace of God made
known after Pentecost than was known in past ages? Eph. 3:5.
     NoTE.—That the gospel of Christ was known as "the power of God unto
salvation" by men of other ages is witnessed by Paul's record of men of faith
given in Hebrews 11. But after Christ's complete victory over Satan there was
a fuller revelation of this mystery through the "holy apostles and prophets by
the Spirit."
                                       [ 12 ]
                       Partakers of His Promise
    7. Who also were partakers of the gospel? Eph. 3:6.
    8. What promise had been made the Gentiles? Hosea 1:10;
Rom. 9:24-26.
   NorE.—The Gentiles (this term includes the whole great heathen world)
were included in God's plan of salvation. One feature of the saving love of
God is that it could make Jews and Gentiles, who had great hatred of each
other, one in heart and mind in Christ.
    9. Of what had Paul been made a minister, and how? Eph. 3:7.

                      The Purpose of God's Gift
   10. How did Paul regard himself? For what purpose had the
gift of grace been given him? Verse 8.
   NOTE.—Paul here expresses his marvel that one so unworthy as he should
have been called to one of the greatest works God had ever given man. It is
when men are humble that God can use them. Prov. 18:12.
   11. What was Paul to make all men see by his preaching? Eph.
3:9.
    NorE.—There is a marvelous fellowship in Jesus Christ. Said John: "If we
walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship one with another."
1 John 1:7. If Christ dwells in my brother's heart, and also in mine, my
brother and I have peace and fellowship with God and each other.
   12. What is the purpose of God for His church? Eph. 3:10, 11.
    NoTE.—The purpose of God for His church is that it shall know by experi-
ence the fullness and completeness of His plan of salvation.
    "The work of redemption will be complete. In the place where sin
abounded, God's grace much more abounds. The earth itself, the very field
that Satan claims as his, is to be not only ransomed but exalted. Our little
world, under the curse of sin the one dark blot in His glorious creation, will be
honored above all other worlds in the universe of God. Here, where the Son
of God tabernacled in humanity; where the King of Glory lived and suffered
and died,—here, when He shall make all things new, the tabernacle of God
shall be with men."—The Desire of Ages, page 26.
   13. What is the effect of this personal knowledge of salvation?
Verse 12.
   14. How did the apostle wish his sufferings to be regarded by his
brethren? Verse 13.
    NcrrE.—Paul wanted his brethren to be made courageous by his afflictions,
and with him to glory in the trials of faith.

                       Lesson 6, for May 12, 1945
                 Glorious Privileges in Christ
     LESSON SCRIPTURE: Ephesians 3:14-21.
     MEMORY VERSE: "That He would grant you, according to the riches of His
glory, to be strengthened with might by His Spirit in the inner man." Eph. 3:16.
     STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pages 19-26.
   . SEED THOUGHT: "Christ was treated as we deserve, that we might be treated
as He deserves. He was condemned for our sins, in which He had. no share, that we
might be justified by His righteousness, in which we had no share. He suffered the
death which was ours, that we might receive the life which was His. 'With His stripes
we are healed.' "—"The Desire of Ages," page 25.

                       Adopted Into God's Family
     1. As Paul considered the love and plan of God for man, what
was he led to do? Eph. 3:14, first part.
    NOTE.—"For this cause." These three words also occur in the beginning
of this chapter. (Verses 2-13 are parenthetical.) The prayer which seems to
have been begun in verse 1 appears to have been interrupted by the apostle's
thought of his personal call to bring Christ to the Gentile world. "Bow my
knees." "Both in public and in private worship, it is our privilege to bow on
our knees before the Lord when we offer our petitions to Him. Jesus, our
example, 'kneeled down, and prayed.' . . . True reverence for God is inspired
by a sense of His infinite greatness and a realization of His presence."—Gospel
Workers, page 178.
     2. To what family does the Christian belong? Verses. 14, last
part, 15.
    NOTE.—An honorable name is one of the greatest gifts which a parent'an
bestow on his children; and for one of lowly birth to be adopted into a family,
the head of which is of honorable life and noble lineage, is greatly .to be
desired and esteemed. How inexpressibly wonderful the infinite love of "the
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ" that He gives His name to all who will take it,
and permits them to call Him "Father"!
     3. What did Paul pray the Father to grant every adopted mem-
ber of His family? Verse 16. ,
    Norr.—"All who consecrate soul, body, and spirit to god, will be con-
stantly receiving a new endowment of physical and mental power. The inex-
haustible supplies of heaven are at their command. Christ gives them the
breath of His own Spirit, the life, of His own life. The Holy Spirit puts forth
its highest energies to work in heart and mind. The grace of God enlarges, and
multiplies their faculties, and every perfection of the divine nature comes to
their'aSsistance in the work of saving souls. Through co-operation with Christ
they are complete in Him, and in their human weakness they are enabled to
do the deeds of Omnipotence."—The Desire of Ages, page 827.
                          An Indwelling Saviour
                                                           p       Z
   4. How are the children of God to be kePt steadfast in their love
and service for.their.heavenly Father?' Verse 17,, first part.
                                       (1:1   ;
    NOTE.—Paul says concerning his experience in Christ: "I am crucified with
Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me." Gal. 2:20.
Paul in' Ephesians 3:17 expressed the prayer of his heart "that Christ may
dwell in your hearts by faith."
     5. What did Christ promise His followers regarding His dwell-
ing in their hearts? John 14:15-18.
     6. What is the result when Christ dwells in a believer's heart?
Eph. 3:17, last part.
    NoTE.—When Christ dwells in the believer's heart, it results in the rooting
and grounding of that believer in the love of Christ. This love manifests itself
in a life of kindness, service, and sacrifice in behalf of others.
     7. How constantly does God care for us? Ps. 121:3, 4; Heb. 7:25,
last part.
    NoTE.—"Through the Spirit, Christ was to abide continually in the hearts
of His children. Their union with Him was closer than when He was personally
with them. The light, and love, and power of the indwelling Christ shone out
through them, so that men, beholding, 'marveled; and they took knowledge
of them, that they had been with Jesus.' All that Christ was to the first dis-
 ciples, He desires to be to His children today."—Steps to Christ, page 80..
                   Christ's Love at Work in the Heart
     8. Of whom is the Holy Spirit to speak? John 15:26; 16:13-15.
    NOTE.—"Before offering Himself as the sacrificial victim, Christ sought
for the most essential and complete gift to bestow upon His followers, a gift
that would bring within their reach the boundless resources of grace.. . .
Before this the Spirit had been in the world; from the very beginning of the
work of redemption He had been moving upon men's hearts. But while Christ
was on earth, the disciples had desired no other helper. Not until they were
deprived of His presence would they feel their need of the Spirit, and then
He would come. The Holy Spirit is Christ's representative, but divested of
the personality of humanity, and independent thereof. . . . By the Spirit
the Saviour would be accessible to all. In this sense He would be nearer to
them than if He had not ascended on high."—The Desire of Ages, pages 668,
669.
     9. When Christ dwells in the believer's heart, what may he
comprehend? Eph. 3:18, 19, first part.
    NOTE.—"The Syriac connects the last clause of verse 16 with verse 17.
 After praying that God's children might 'be strengthened with might by His
 Spirit,' this follows the semicolon: 'That in your inner man the Messiah may
 dwell by faith, and in your hearts by love, while your root and your founda-
 tion waxeth strong.' The thoughts are in a way parallel=the Spirit in .the
 inner man, and Christ dwelling in the heart. The heart is the seat of the affec-
 tions. Christ dwelling in the heart gives us the love of Christ. The Spirit is
 the life and the power ; and that, dwelling in the inner man, gives us power
 over sin. See 2 Cor. 4:16 ; 1 Peter 3:4."—M. C. Wilcox, Studies in Ephesians,
 page 66.
    10. • With what will those who know the love of Christ be filled?
 Eph.:3:19, last part.
                                      [15]
     NoTE.—Some idea of the vastness of "the fullness of God" may be obtained
 from this paragraph from Christ's Object Lessons:
     "As the life of Christ and the character of His mission are dwelt upon, rays
 of light will shine forth more distinctly at every attempt to discover truth.
 Each fresh search will reveal something more deeply interesting than has yet
 been unfolded. The subject is inexhaustible. The study of the incarnation of
 Christ, His atoning sacrifice and mediatorial work, will employ the mind of
 the diligent student as long as time shall last; and looking to heaven with its
 unnumbered years, he will exclaim, 'Great is the mystery of godliness.'"—
 Page 134.
    11. How great is God's ability to do for us? Verse 20.
     NoTE.—"Is anything too hard for the Lord?" asked the Lord of Abraham.
Gen. 18:14. God, who is infinite in all His powers and attributes, can do for
each of us personally all that is best for us. "Trust in God, and obedience to
His will, are as essential to the Christian in the spiritual warfare as to Gideon
and Joshua in their battles with the Canaanites. . . . He is just as willing to
work with the efforts of His people now, and to accomplish great things through
weak instrumentalities. All heaven awaits our demand upon its wisdom and
strength."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 554.
    12. How does the apostle close his prayer for the church? Eph.
3:21.
    NoTE.—"The Lord desires us to appreciate the great plan of redemption, to
realize our high privilege as the children of God, and to walk before Him in
obedience, with grateful thanksgiving. . . . To praise God in fullness and sin-
cerity of heart is as much a duty as is prayer. . . . We are to praise God by
tangible service, by doing all in our power to advance the glory of His name.
God imparts His gifts to us that we also may give, and thus make known His
character to the world."—Christ's Object Lessons, pages 299, 300.


                       Lesson 7, for May 19, 1945
                      The Unity of the Spirit
     LESSON SCRIPTURE: Ephesians 4:1-16.
     MEMORY VERSE: "That they all may be one; as Thou, Father, art in Me, and
I in Thee, that they also may be one in Us: that the world may believe that Thou hest
sent Me." John 17:21.
     STUDY HELP: "Testimonies," vol. 4, pp. 65-67.
     SEED THOUGHT: "In loving sympathy and confidence God's workers are to
unite with one another. He who says or does anything that ten& to separate the
members of Christ's church, is counterworking the Lord's purpose. . . . True religion
unites hearts not only with Christ, but with one another, in a most tender union."—
"Testimonies," vol. 9, p. 145.
                                  The Appeal
    1. How did Paul again speak of himself? Eph. 4:1, first part.
   NOTE.—This is the second time Paul speaks of himself as "the prisoner of
the Lord." See Eph. 3:1. Paul was an ambassador of the Messiah, who had
power to release him from Roman bondage. Hence he speaks of himself as
Christ's prisoner. It was thus that he could love those who persecuted him.
                                     [16 1
     2. What did he beseech his brethren to do? Eph. 4:1, last part.
    Nom—God had called, predestinated (Eph. 1:5, 11) those to whom Paul
was writing to "the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to Himself." No
calling can be more exalted than this.
     3. How are we to relate ourselves to others? What should they
endeavor to do? Eph. 4:2, 3.
    NOTE.—"The apostle exhorts his brethren to manifest in their lives the
power of the truth which he had presented to arm. By meekness and gentle-
ness, forbearance and love, they were to exemplify the character of Christ and
the blessings of His salvation. . . . Paul's instructions were not written alone
for the church in his day. God designed that they should be sent down to us.
What are we doing to preserve unity in the bonds of peace?"—Testimonies,
vol. 5, p. 239.
                             The Unifying Spirit
     4. What three unities are named by the apostle? Verse 4.
    NOTE.—(a) ,"One body." The church of Christ, of which He is the head,
is always spoken of in the singular. But this "body" has many members. The
members of the human body co-ordinate with each other. Their union and
mutual helpfulness are used by Inspiration as an example of the loving co-
operation which should exist among members of the body of Christ, the church.
See 1 Cor. 12:12-27. (b) "One Spirit." The Holy Spirit, the Comforter, the
Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of truth are but different
names for the "one Spirit" here named. See John 14:12-18; 15:26; 16:7-14. He
is sent by Christ to unite the members of the church into a great working force
for God. "The Spirit of God, received into the heart by faith, is the begin-
ning of the life eternal."—The Desire of Ages, page 388. (c) "One hope." The
hope here spoken of is for the complete restoration of all things in Christ at
the time of His second coming.' "Hope and courage are essential to perfect
service for God. These are the fruit of faith."—Prophets and Kings, page 164.
     5. By what other unities is the church bound together? Eph.
4:5, 6.
    No-I-E.—When God is indeed the Father "of" and "in" and "through" each
member, there can be no division among brethren. "One baptism," baptism by
immersion, is symbolic of the death, burial, and resurrection of our Saviour.
Rom. 6:3-6. Unity of baptism is also symbolic of unity in church fellowship.
Gal. 3:27-29.
    "Study the second chapter of Acts. In the early church the Spirit of God
wrought mightily through those who were harmoniously united. On the Day
of Pentecost they were all with one accord in one place.
    "We are to demonstrate to the world that men of every nationality are
one in Christ Jesus. Then let us remove every barrier, and come into unity in
the service of the Master."—Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 196.
                       - Christ's Gifts of Grace
    6. What is given to every believer, and to what extent? Eph. 4:7.
   NOTE.—Christ's gift of grace to us is to be used by us toward our brethren.
This will enable us to overlook and forgive their weaknesses, as Christ over-
looks and forgives ours. "Angels are watching with intense interest to see
                                    [ L7
how man is dealing with his fellow men. When they see one manifest Christ-
like sympathy for the erring, they press to his side, and bring to his remem-
brance words to speak that will be as the bread of life to the soul."—Christ's
Object Lessons, page 149.
     7. What two things did Christ do when, after. His resurrection,
He ascended to His Father? Verse 8.
    NorE.—"He led captivity captive." When Christ ascended as a con-
queror, He took with Him to heaven those who had been raised from the dead
with Him. "Those who came forth from the grave at Christ's resurrection
were raised to everlasting life. They ascended with Him as trophies of His
victory over death and the grave."—The Desire of Ages, page 786. "Gave gifts
unto men." In His parables of the talents (Matt. 25:14-30) and of the pounds
(Luke 19:11-26), Christ represented His gifts to His church. "The talents
that Christ entrusts to His church represent especially the gifts and blessings
imparted by the Holy Spirit. . . . The gifts are already ours in Christ, but
their actual possession depends upon our reception of the Spirit of God."—
Christ's Object Lessons, page 327.
               The Purpose of the Gifts to the Church
     8. What did Christ do before He ascended? Eph. 4:9.
     9. In His descension and ascension, what did He accomplish?
Verse 10.
    NOTE.—"He might fulfill [margin] all things." In this parenthesis (verses
9, 10) Paul in few words sets forth the sacrifice and complete victory of our
Saviour. Before sin entered the universe, He was one with His Father in
glory and power. But when sin and death came, He descended to the lowest
depths of human woe, ignominy, and death to rescue all mankind. However,
He could not be held in the bonds of death. His Father brought Him from
the tomb and "bath highly exalted Him, and given Him a name which is above
every name." Phil. 2:9.
    10. What five gifts of Christ does Paul mention, and for what
purpose are they given? Eph. 4:11, 12.
    NoTE.—Not all of the gifts of the Spirit are mentioned in any one passage
of Scripture. It is only by studying all the Scriptures relating to them that we
obtain an understanding of their exceeding fullness. The gifts here mentioned
—apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, teachers—are especially' necessary in
building up the church, and are also representative of other gifts. See 1 Corin-
thians 12; Rom. 12:3-5; Matt. 25:14; Luke 19:12, 13.
   11. Toward what ultimate objective are these gifts of Christ to
be exercised in the church? Eph. 4:13.
    NorE.—The gifts of Christ to His church did not end with the apostolic
age, else there would have been no evangelists, pastors, or teachers from then
until now. These gifts, including apostles and prophets, are to continue until
all the people of God reach their full stature in Christ, until each member per-
fectly reflects the glory of Christ's character.
    12. What will these gifts do for the church? Verses 14-16.
    NcrrE,(a) "No more children." These gifts enable us to grow into strong
Christian manhood and womanhood. Heb. 5;12-14. (b) "Every wind' of
                                       [ 18 3
 doctrine" indicates a plurality of false doctrines (Col. 2:22 ; 1 Tim. 4:1; Heb.
13:9) ; whereas God's doctrine is only one, the doctrine of salvation by faith
 in Jesus Christ. (c) "Speaking the truth in love." Love is to the body of
 Christ, the church, what blood is to the human body. It makes possible the
.effectual working in the measure of every part. The unity and strength of the
 church of Christ depend directly and continually upon His gifts to it.


                        Lesson 8, for May 26, 1945
                             Following Christ
     LESSON SCRIPTURE: Ephesians 4:17-32.
     MEMORY VERSE: "And that ye put on the new man, which after God is
created in righteousness and true holiness." Eph. 4:24.
     STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pages 114-123.
     SEED THOUGHT: "By their good works, Christ's followers are to bring glory,
not to themselves, but to Him through whose grace and power they have wrought.
It is through the Holy Spirit that every good work is accomplished, and the Spirit is
given to glorify, not the receiver, but the Giver. When the light of Christ is shining in
the soul, the lips will be filled with praise and thanksgiving to God. Your prayers,
yoUr performance of duty, your benevolence, your self-denial, will not be the theme of
your thought or conversation. Jesus will be magnified, self will be hidden, and Christ
will appear as all in all."—"Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing," page 121.

                            A New Man in Christ
      1. How are we not to walk? Eph. 4:17.
     NOTE.—"In the vanity of their mind." Those who are living for what is
 falsely called the good things of this world are living in "the vanity of their
 mind;" for this world and all therein will pass away.
      2. How does Paul describe those who know not Christ? Verses
18, 19.
     NoTE.—"Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life
 of God." "This is not an act of arbitrary power on the part of God. The rejec-
 ters of His mercy reap that which they have sown. God is the fountain of life;
 and when one chooses the service of sin, he separates from God, and thus cuts
 himself off from life. He is 'alienated from the life of God.' "—The Desire of
 Ages, pages 763, 764. Romans 1:18-32 gives a description of lives in which
 God has no part.
      3. What contrasting experience is revealed in those who have
 been taught of Christ? Eph. 4:20-23.
      4. What is to be "put on" after we have "put off" "the old man"?
 Verse 24.
     NOTE.—This is not a change in "the old man," but a change entire from
 him to "the new man." Christianity is positive. Unless Christ continually
  dwells in the heart after a person accepts Him, one may drift into an unhappier
  condition than before conversion. See Matt. 12:43-45.
                        Evidences of a Changed Life
      5, What change will "the new man" reveal in his talk? Why?
        4:25. .,
                                          [19]
     6. Who will abide in God's "tabernacle," His church? Ps. 15:1-3.
    NOTE.—"When we listen to a reproach against our brother, we take up that
reproach. To the question, 'Lord, who shall abide in Thy tabernacle? who
shall dwell in Thy holy hill?' the psalmist answered, 'He that walketh up-,
rightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart.' . . .
What a world of gossip would be prevented, if every man would remember
that those who tell him the faults of others, will as freely publish his faults
at a favorable opportunity."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 58.
      7. What are we commanded to do about anger? Eph. 4:26.
     NoTE.—An illustration of the thought, "Be ye angry, and sin not," is found
 in the following paragraph from Testimonies to Ministers, concerning the
anger of Moses at Sinai:
     "As Moses came down from the mountain with the two tables of the testi-
 mony in his hand, he heard the shouts of the people, and, as he came near,
 beheld the idol and the reveling multitude. Overwhelmed with horror and in-
 dignation that God had been dishonored, and that the people had broken their
solemn covenant with Him, he cast the two tables of stone upon the ground,
and broke them beneath the mount. Though his love for Israel was so great
that he was willing to lay down his own life for them, yet his zeal for the
glory of God moved him to anger, which found expression in this act of such
terrible significance. God did not rebuke him. The breaking of the tables of
stone was but a representation of the fact that Israel had broken the covenant
which they had so recently made with God. It is a righteous indignation
against sin, which springs from zeal for the glory of God, not that anger
 prompted by self-love or wounded ambition, which is referred to in the
scripture, 'Be ye angry, and sin not.' Such was the anger of Moses."—Pages
100, 101.
      8. To whom are we cautioned not to give place? Verse 27.
    NOTE.—He who cherishes anger in his heart against another, gives all the
place to the devil that anger occupies. "Anger resteth in the bosom of fools."
Eccl. 7:9. He who harbors it, harbors an enemy to his own soul; and this is
true of any other sin. One sin cherished, or given place in the heart, will open
the door to the devil.
      9. What is the one who stole commanded to do? Eph. 4:28.
    NoTE.—A very broad principle is here enunciated. We may steal without
breaking into homes or rifling pockets. We may withhold that which belongs
to another.
       Love and Kindness Demonstrate Christ's Presence
   10. What is to be the nature of our words? Verse 29.
   NOTE.—"The religion of Jesus softens whatever is hard and rough in the
temper, and smooths whatever is rugged and sharp in the manners. . . . Kind
words are as dew and gentle showers to the soul. . . . And the Lord bids us,
`Let your speech be alway with grace' that it may minister grace unto the
hearers.'"—Gospel Workers, page 122.
  11. Against what attitude toward the Holy Spirit are we warned?
Verse 30.
   NoTE.—"Men have the power to quench the Spirit of God; the power of
choosing is left with them. They are allowed freedom of action. . . . The
                                  r 20 I
Spirit of God is continually convicting, and souls are deciding for or against
the truth. How important, then, that every act of life be such that it need not
be repented of, especially among the ambassadors of Christ, who are acting in
His stead !"—Gospel Workers, page 174.
   12. What are we to "put away"? Verse 31.
   13. How are we to treat one another? Verse 32.
    NOTE.—"It is not the opposition of the world that most endangers the
church of Christ. It is the evil cherished in the hearts of believers that works
their most grievous disaster, and most surely retards the progress of God's
cause. There is no surer way of weakening spirituality than by cherishing
envy, suspicion, faultfinding, and evil surmising. On the other hand, the
strongest witness that God has sent His Son into the world, is the existence
of harmony and union among men of varied dispositions who form His
church. This witness it is the privilege of the followers of Christ to bear. But
in order to do this, they must place themselves under Christ's command. Their
characters must be conformed to His chara_ter, and their wills to His will."—
The Acts of the Apostles, page 549.


                        Lesson 9, for June 2, 1945
                       Walking in God's Path
     LESSON SCRIPTURE: Ephesians 5:1-13.
     MEMORY VERSE: "Walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given
Himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savor." Eph. 5:2.
     STUDY HELPS: "Gospel Workers," pages 111-113; "The Acts of the Apostles,"
pages 474-477.
     SEED THOUGHT: "There is only one path that leads from darkness upward
to the light until it touches the throne of God,—the path of faith. . . . Entrance to it
cannot be gained by works of penance. The way that God has provided is so complete,
so perfect, that man, cannot, by any works that he can do, add to its perfection. It is
broad enough to receive the most hardened sinner, if he truly repents, and yet so nar-
row that in it sin can find no place. This is the path cast up for the ransomed of the
Lord to walk in."—"Gospel Workers," page 160.

                  Walking With Christ in Love
     1.. What are we enjoined to do? Eph. 5:1.
   NOTE.—The apostle here sums up his various injunctions to godly life
noted in previous chapters, by this admonition, "Be ye therefore followers of
God, as dear children."
     2. How are "followers of God" to walk? Verse 2.
   NOTE.—"Given Himself for us." What an example of love is here given us!
God gave His Son, but as well did the Son give Himself, "a sweet-smelling
savor," an offering of dedication, as well as a sacrifice for atonement. -See
Lev. 1:9; Ezek. 20:41.
                           Not of God's Kingdom
   3. How are we to treat all that is low, vulgar, base, and evil?
Eph. 5:3, 4, first part.
                                         [ 21 ]
    NorE.—The word "but" introduces this verse as in striking contrast to the
purity called for in the preceding two verses. "Covetousness" is an unlawful
desire not only for money, but for anything else. "While other offenses meet
with detection and punishment, how rarely does the violation of the tenth
commandment so much as call forth censure. The enormity of this sin, and its
terrible results, are the lessons of Achan's history. Covetousness is an evil of
gradual development."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 496.
    4. What further instruction is given regarding God's gift of
speech? Verse 4, last part.
   NOTE.—"Rejoice in the Lord alway," wrote Paul to the Philippian church.
Phil. 4:4-6. If this counsel is heeded, there is no time, no opportunity, for
harmful conversation.
    5. Who are denied an inheritance in the kingdom of God?
Eph. 5:5.
                       Walk as Children of Light
     6. How may we be deceived, and what is the punishment of
those thus deceived? What warning is given? Verses 6, 7; Col. 2:6-8.
    NorE.—The context here indicates that the "vain words" here referred to
are such as lead to the deception that the foregoing indulgences may be cher-
ished without imperiling one's hope of heaven. Words that nullify sin and
deny its punishment are themselves sin.
     7. What change is to be seen in Christians? How are they to
walk? Eph. 5:8.
     8. How is "the fruit of the Spirit" shown? Verse 9.
    NOTE.—Our daily walk or deportment reveals the inner workings of our
heart, for out of it come all the issues of our lives. Prov. 4:23. "By their
 fruits ye shall know them," said Christ. Matt. 7:16-20.
    9. What are the children of light to prove? Eph. 5:10.
                          Revealed by the Light
   10. What fellowship must we avoid? Verse 11.
   NorE.—Godly lives are stronger reproof of the "works of darkness" than
are words, though words may be necessary. "Those who have, learned of
Christ will 'have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness.' In
speech, as in life, they will be simple, straightforward, and true; for they are
preparing for the fellowship of those holy ones in whose mouth is found no
guile."—Prophets and Kings, page 252.
   11. What should we avoid in our conversation? Verse 12.
    NoTE.—"All impurity of speech or of thought must be shunned by him
who would have clear discernment of spiritual truth."—The Desire of Ages,
page 302.
   12. What should be the effect of the life of Christ—the Light of
the world—upon us? Verse 13.
    NOTE.—"It is the light which should be cherished. 'Thy word is a lamp
unto my feet, and a light unto my path,' says the psalmist. Of Jesus Christ,
                                      [ 22 )
the One who gives the word, we read that He is the 'Light of the world' and
so God's word cherished in our heart through Him will reveal sin in us, will
cleanse the sin, will make His children what He desires them to be, the light
of the world, revealing by contrast of life and teaching the world's sin and the
world's deformities and the world's failures and mistakes, and revealing also
the clear, strong righteous way in which God's children should walk."—M. C.
Wilcox, Studies in Ephesians, page 92.


                      Lesson 10, for June 9, 1945
                         Fruits of the Spirit
     LESSON SCRIPTURE: Ephesians 5:14-21.
     MEMORY VERSE: "Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the
Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ." Eph. 5:20.
     STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pages 674-680.
     SEED THOUGHT: "All the followers of Christ bear fruit to His glory. Their
lives testify that a good work has been wrought in them by the Spirit of God, and
their fruit is unto holiness. Their lives are elevated and pure. Those who bear no
fruit, have no experience in the things of God. They are not in the Vine."—"Testi-
monies," vol. 1, pp. 288, 289.

                      Letting Christ Be Our Light
     1. What command is here given God's children? Eph. 5:14.
    NoTE.—"Satan cannot hold the dead in his grasp when the Son of God
bids them live. He cannot hold in spiritual death one soul who in faith re-
ceives• Christ's word of power. God is saying to all who are dead in sin, 'Awake
thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead.' That word is eternal life. As the
word of God which bade the first man live, still gives us life; as Christ's word,
`Young man, I say unto thee, Arise,' gave life to the youth of Nain, so that
word, 'Arise from the dead,' is life to the soul that receives it."—The Desire of
Ages, page 320.
     2. What is God's call to His people? What will result from their
response? Isa. 60:1-3.
    NoTE.—"Christ has made every provision that His church shall be a trans-
formed body, illumined with the Light of the world, possessing the glory of
Immanuel. It is His purpose that every Christian shall be surrounded with
a spiritual atmosphere of li,,ht and peace. He desires that we shall reveal His
own joy in our lives."—Prophets and Kings, page 720.
    3. How are we to walk? Eph. 5:15.
    NoTE.—One definition of the word "walk" given by Webster is: "to behave;
to pursue a course of life, to conduct one's self."
    4. What can man not do for himself? Jer. 10:23.
   5. From whom comes our power to will and to do? Phil. 2:13;
Prov. 3:5, 6.
   NOTE.—"The Lord requires us to move with a humble dependence upon His
providence. 'It is not in man that walketh to direct his steps.' In God is our
                                      [ 28 ]
prosperity and our life. Nothing can be done prosperously without the per-
mission and blessing of God. He can set His hand to prosper and bless, or He
can turn His hand against us. 'Commit thy way unto the Lord; trust also in
Him, and He shall bring it to pass.' We are required, as children of God, to
maintain a consistent Christian character. We should exercise prudence, cau-
tion, and humility, and walk circumspectly toward them that are without.
Yet we are not in any case to surrender principle."—Testimonies, vol. 3, p. 482.
    6. What are we exhorted to do, and why? Eph. 5:16.
                              These Evil Days
    7. How does Paul describe the last days? 2 Tim. 3:1-5.
    NOTE.—"The Bible declares that before the coming of the Lord there will
exist a state of religious declension similar to that in the first centuries. . . .
Satan will work 'with all power and signs and lying wonders, and with all
deceivableness of unrighteousness.' And all that 'received not the love of the
truth, that they might be saved,' will be left to accept 'strong delusion, that
they should believe a lie.' When this state of ungodliness shall be reached, the
same results will follow as in the first centuries."—The Great Controversy,
page 444.
    8. What are Christ's words to His people living in the day of His
appearing? Matt. 24:42-51.
     9. What are we to understand? Eph. 5:17.
    NOTE.—"The will of God is expressed in the precepts of His holy law, and
the principles of this law are the principles of heaven. The angels of heaven
attain unto no higher knowledge than to know the will of God; and to do His
will is the highest service that can engage their powers."—Thoughts From the
Mount of Blessing, page 161.
                           Filled With the Spirit
   10. What is placed in contrast with being "drunk with wine"?
Verse 18.
    NOTE.—"Christ promised the gift of the Holy Spirit to His church, and the
promise belongs as much to us as to the first disciples. . . . The impartation
of the Spirit is the impartation of the life of Christ."—Gospel Workers, pages
284, 285.
   11. What is the happy experience of those who are truly "filled
with the Spirit"? Verse 19.
   12. How constantly will praise come from the Spirit-filled heart?
Verse 20.
    NoTE.—"God is glorified by songs of praise from a pure heart. . . . Those
who adhere strictly to the admonitions and instructions of God's word, prayer-
fully seeking to know and do His righteous will, feel not the petty grievances
daily occurring. The gratitude which they feel, and the peace of God ruling
within, causes them to make melody in their hearts unto the Lord, and by
words to make mention of the debt of love and thankfulness due the dear
Saviour."—Testimonies, vol. 1, pp. 509, 510.
                                      (24]
     13. When directed by God's Holy Spirit, how will we relate our-
selves to our brethren? Verse 21.
    NOTE.—"The twenty-first verse, which seems to belong to a different line
of thought, in reality completes the foregoing paragraph.. . . Each must
consider that it is his part to serve and not rule in the service of God's house.
    "In our common work and worship, in all the offices of life this is the
Christian law. No man within Christ's church, however commanding his
powers, may set himself above the duty of submitting his judgment and will
to that of his fellows. In mutual subjection lies our freedom, with our strength
and peace."—Findlay, The Epistle to the Ephesians, pages 349, 350.


                     Lesson 11, for June 16, 1945
                       The Christian Home
     LESSON SCRIPTURE: Ephesians 5:22-33.
     MEMORY VERSE: "That He might present it to Himself a glorious church. not
having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without
blemish." Eph. 5:27.
     STUDY HELP: "Testimonies," vol. 7, pp. 45-50.
     SEED THOUGHT: "God designs that the families of earth shall be a symbol
of the family in heaven."—"Testimonies," vol. 6, p. 430.

                   The Relation of Husband and Wife
     1. What injunction is given the wife? Eph. 5:22.
    NorE.—"Such subordination implies no inferiority, rather the opposite.
A free and sympathetic obedience—which is the true submission—can only
subsist between equals. The apostle writes: 'Children, obey; . . . servants,
obey' (6:1, 5) ; but 'wives, submit yourselves to your own husband as to the
Lord.' The same word denotes submission within the church, and within the
house. It is here that Christianity, in contrast with paganism, and notably
with Mohammedanism, raises the weaker sex to honor. . . . It is one of the
glories of our faith that it has enfranchised our sisters, and raises them in
spiritual calling to the full level of their brothers and husbands."—Findlay,
The Epistle to the Ephesians, pages 356, 357.
     2. What comparison is made between husband and wife and
Christ and the church? Eph. 5:23, 24.
    NorE.—"Christ honored the marriage relation by making it also a symbol
of the union between Him and His redeemed ones. He Himself is the Bride-
groom; the bride is the church, of which, as His chosen one, He says, 'Thou
art all fair, My love; there is no spot in thee.' "—The Ministry of Healing,
page 356.
     3. What instruction is given husbands? Verse 25.
    Nom—Christ is here set forth as the husband's model of pure, unselfish
 love. "It is only in Christ that a marriage alliance can be safely formed. Human
love should draw its closest bonds from divine love. Only where Christ reigns
can there be deep, true, unselfish affection."—The Ministry of Healing, page
358.
                                         (263
     4. What general advice might husbands and wives well apply?
Eph. 4:2, last part.
    NOTE.—"Though difficulties, perplexities, and discouragements may arise,
let neither husband nor wife harbor the thought that their union is a mistake
or a disappointment. Determine to be all that it is possible to be to each other.
Continue the early attentions. In every way encourage each other is, fighting
the battles of life. Study to advance the happiness of each other. Let there be
mutual love, mutual forbearance. Then marriage, instead of being the end
of love, will be as it were the very beginning of love. The warmth of true
friendship, the love that binds heart to heart, is a foretaste of the joys of
heaven."—The Ministry of Healing, page 360.
      5. What does love (charity) do? 1 Peter 4:8.
    NorE.—"Love's agencies have wonderful power, for they are divine. The
soft answer that `turneth away wrath,' the love that `suffereth long, and is
kind,' the charity that `covereth a multitude of sins,'—would we learn the
lesson, with what power for healing would our lives be gifted ! How life
would be transformed, and the earth become a very likeness and foretaste of
heaven !"—Education, page 114.
     6. What example is given of God's willingness to guide in the
choice of a life companion? Gen. 24:41-51.
     NOTE.—"If there is any subject which should be carefully considered and
in which the counsel of older and more experienced persons should be sought,
it is the subject of marriage; if ever the Bible was needed as a counselor, if
ever divine guidance should be sought in prayer, it is before taking a step that
binds persons together for life."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 175.
                  Christ, the Church, and the Home
    7. Why did Christ give Himself for His church? Eph. 5:26, 27.
   NOTE.—As Christ sought by the sacrifice of Himself to present unto God a
spotless, glorious church, so will the husband and wife seek by the sacrificial
love manifest in the building of the home, to present to Christ and to the world
a home like that heavenly home of which it is a symbol.
    8. How tender should be the love of the husband for his wife?
Verses 28, 29.
   NorE.—"The grace of Christ, and this alone, can make this institution
[marriage] what God designed it should be,—an agent for the blessing and
uplifting of humanity. And thus the families of earth, in their unity and
peace and love, may ,represent the family _of heaven."—Thoughts `•om the
Mount of Blessing, page 101.
    9. In what bond of unity did God create man and woman? Gen.
2:23, 24.
                          An Indissoluble Union
   10. How close are the bonds of unity between Christ and His
people? Eph. 5:30; Heb. 2:14-18.
   11. Of what indissoluble union is Marriage a type? Eph. 5:31; 32.
 - NoTE.—The chief theme of Paul's letter 10. the. Ephesians is the mystery of
the gospel Of saiVatiori,rthe union of divinity with humanity—"Christ in you,
                                      [ 261
the hope of glory." The closest human union typical of this spiritual union
is the union of two lives, man and woman, in marriage.
   12. How. does Paul conclude his instruction to husband and wife?
Verse 33.
   NorE.—"Men and women can reach God's ideal for them if they will take
Christ as their helper. . . . His providence can unite hearts in bonds that are
of heavenly origin. Love will not be a mere exchange of soft and flattering
words. The loom of heaven weaves with warp and woof finer, yet more firm,
than can be woven by the looms of earth. The result is not a tissue fabric,
tont a texture that will bear wear and test and trial. Heart will be bound to
heart in the golden bonds of a love that is enduring."—The Ministry of Healing,
page 362.
                  Better than gold is a peaceful home,
                  Where all the fireside charities come;
                  The shrine of love and the heaven of life,
                  Hallowed by mother, or sister, or wife.
                  However humble the home may be,
                  Or tried with sorrows by heaven's decree,
                  The blessings that never were bought or sold,
                  And center there, are better than gold.—Anon.


                      Lesson 12, for June 23; 1945
           The Spirit of Obedience and Service
     LESSON SCRIPTURE: Ephesians
     MEMORY VERSE: "With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to
men." Eph. 6:7.
     STUDY HELP: "Education," pages 287-297.
     SEED THOUGHT: "The Christian family is the cradle and the fortress of the
Christian faith. Here its virtues shine most brightly; and by this channel its influence
spreads through society and the course of generations. Marriage has been placed under
the guardianship of God; it is made single, chaste, and enduring, according to the law
of creation and the pattern of Christ's union with His church. With parents thus
united, family honor is secure; and a basis is laid for reverence and discipline within
the house."—Findlay, "The Epistle to the Ephesians," page 380.

                      Obedience to Parents Enjoined
    1. What instruction is given to children? Eph. 6:1.
   Nora.7—"Parents are entitled to a degree of love and respect which is due
to no other person. God Himself, who has placed upon them a responsibility
for the souls committed to their charge, has ordained that during the earlier
years of life, parents shall stand in the place of God to their children. And
he who rejects the rightful authority of his parents, is rejecting the authority
of God. The fifth commandment requires" children not -only to yield respect,
submission, and obedience to their parents, but also to give them love and
tenderness, to lighten their cares, to guard their reputation, and to succor and
comfort them in old .age. It also enjoins respect. for ministers and rulers, and
for all others to whom God has delegated authority."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
page 308.
                                         [ 27 ]
     2. What relationship did Christ maintain toward His earthly
parents? Luke 2:51, 52.
    NoTE.—"All true obedience comes from the heart. It was heart work with
Christ."—The Desire of Ages, page 668.
     3. What is to be rendered parents? Eph. 6:2.
    NOTE.—Honor is defined by Webster as "esteem due or paid to worth."
Children cannot honor parents unless parents are honorable; it is difficult for
children to honor parents unless parents are worthy of honor. "Children
are an heritage of the Lord." Ps. 127:3. And when parents "train up a child
in the way he should go: . . . he will not depart from it." Prov. 22:6.
Love, wisdom, firmness, and patience on the part of parents in the training
of their children beget a confidence, trust, and esteem on the part of the chil-
dren which makes obedience come from the heart. "The restoration and up-
lifting of humanity begins in the home. The work of parents underlies every
other."—The Ministry of Healing, page 349.
     4. What promise is made to obedient children? Eph. 6:3; Ex.
20:12.
                      The Father's Responsibility
     5. Against what are fathers to guard themselves? Why? How
are they to bring up their children? Eph. 6:4; Col. 3:21.
    NOTE.—"Love begets love, affection begets affection. The spirit which you
manifest toward your children will be reflected upon you."—Testimonies, vol.
2, p. 95. "Parents must see that their own hearts and lives are controlled by
the divine precepts, if they would bring up their children in the nurture and
admonition of the Lord. . . . Some parents—and some teachers, as well—
seem to forget that they themselves were once children. . . . Smile, parents;
smile, teachers. If your heart is sad, let not your face reveal the fact. . . .
The young need to have a firm barrier built up from their infancy between
them and the world, that its corrupting influence may not affect them. Parents
must exercise increasing watchfulness, that their children be not lost to God."
—Fundamentals of Christian Education, pages 67-69. "Parents who are kind
and polite at home, while at the same time they are firm and decided, will see
the same traits manifested in their children. If they are upright, honest, and
honorable, their children will be quite likely to resemble them in these par-
ticulars. If they reverence and worship God, their children, trained in the
same way, will not forget to serve Him also ."—T estimonies , vol. 5, pp. 319,320.
     6. How constantly are children to be taught the law and way
of God? Deut. 6:4-9.
     7. What did God say concerning Abraham's authority in his
own household? With what result? Gen. 18:19.
                The Relation of Master and Servant
     8. What instruction is given servants? Eph. 6:5, 6.
    Nora.—" 'Not with eyeservice, as men-pleasers.' Both these are rare com-
pound words,—the former indeed occurring only here and in the companion
letter, being coined, probably, by the writer for this use. It is the common
fault and temptation of servants in all degrees to observe the master's eye, and
to work busily or slackly as they are watched or not. Such workmen act as
                                      [28]
they do, because they look to men and not to God. Their work is without
conscience and self-respect. The visible master says, 'Well done!' But there is
another Master looking on, who says 'Ill done to all pretentious doings and
works of eyeservice,—who sees not as man sees, but judges with the act the
motive and intent. . . . In His book of accounts there is a stern reckoning
in store for deceitful dealers and the makers-up of unsound goods, in whatever
handicraft or headcraft they are engaged."—Findlay, The Epistle to the Ephe-
sians, page 391.
     9. What high motive should actuate our service? Col. 3:22, 23.
    NOTE.—In Paul's day slavery was regarded as a fundamental institution
upon which civilized society was to exist. Aristotle said a slave was an "ani-
mated tool" and a tool an "inanimate slave." Small wonder then that the gospel
of the equality of men in Christ found ready acceptance among the great
masses of the pagan world. Its teachings doomed slavery. However, Paul
does not advise the slave to leave his master, but rather to do his work
heartily as unto the Lord, remembering that from the Lord will come his real
reward. This principle of loyalty to those for whom we work rests upon the
free man as well as upon the slave.
   10. In what spirit are we to serve, and why? Eph. 6:7, 8.
   11. How are masters to treat those in their employ? Verse 9.
    NorE.—"Same things unto them." This is an application of Christ's golden
rule, "Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you.
do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets." Matt. 7:12. There
is one Lord in heaven for both master and servant, employer and employee.
"Neither is there respect of persons with Him." When those who employ or
oversee and those who serve, work for the Master in heaven, there is diligence
and happiness, and therefore large accomplishments.
   12. How does God refer to Abraham as a master? Gen. 18:19.
    NOTE.—Abraham not only led his children, but his household—his servants
—in "the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment." "He [Abraham]
did not neglect the soul of the humblest servant. In his household there was
not one law for the master, and another for the servant; a royal way for the
rich, and another for the poor. All were treated with justice and compassion,
as inheritors with him of the grace of life."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 142.


                     Lesson 13, for June 30, 1945
                     The Christian's Armor
    LESSON SCRIPTURE: Ephesians 6 : 10-24.
    MEMORY VERSE: "Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the
power of His might." Eph. 6:10.
    STUDY HELP: "The Great Controversy," pages 505-510 (new edition, pages
573-579).
    SEED THOUGHT: "We are soldiers of Christ; and those who enlist in His
army are expected to do difficult work, work which will tax their energies to the
utmost. We must understand that a soldier's life is one of aggressive warfare, of
perseverance and endurance. For Christ's sake we are to endure trials. We are not
                                     [ 29
engaged in mimic battles. We have to meet most 'powerful adversaries. . . . We are
to find our strength- just where the early disciples found their strength; 'These all•con-
tinued with one accord in prayer and supplication.' "—"Testimonies," vol. 6, p. 140.

                        The Full Armor Essential
      1. In concluding his inspired letter to the Ephesians, what does
Paul, the aged, exhort his brethren to do? Eph. 6:10.
     NorE.—"In the power of His might." The power of God is ,unlimited;
nothing is too hard for Him. "All power is given unto Me," said Christ, "and,
lo, I am with you alway." Matt. 28:18, 20. Hence there is an assured triumph
in standing "against the wiles of the devil" for one who follows this injunction
of the apostle.
      2. Why do we need "the whole armor of God"? Eph. 6:11-13.
     NOTE.—"It is not safe for us, when going into battle, to cast away our
weapons. It is then that we need to be equipped with the whole armor of God.
Every piece is essential."—Testimonies, vol. 7, p. 190. "From the days of
Adam to our own time, our great enemy [the devil] has been exercising his
power to oppress and destroy. He is now preparing for his last campaign
against the church. All who seek to follow Jesus will be brought into conflict
with this relentless foe. The more nearly the Christian imitates the divine Pat-
tern, the more surely will he make himself a mark for the attacks of Satan.
. . . Christ will give strength to all who seek it. No man without his own
consent can be overcome by Satan. . . . The fact that Christ has conquered
should inspire His followers with courage to fight manfully the battle against
sin and Satan."—The Great Controversy, page 510.

                     Our Armor and Our Weapons
    3. What weapons of spiritual warfare does Paul first mention?
Verse 14. See Ps. 91:4.
   NOTE.—"Linked to the Infinite One, man is made partaker of the divine
nature. Upon him the shafts of evil have no effect ; for he is clothed with the
panoply of Christ's righteousness."—Counsels to Teachers, page 52.
     4. With what are the feet to be shod? Eph. 6:15.
    NoTE.—The soldiers for Christ are to fight an offensive warfare. They
are to go into all the world with Christ's gospel of peace, as the Prince of Peace
commanded. Mark 16:15. "How beautiful are the feet of them that preach
the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!" See Rom. 10:13-15.
     5. How important is the shield of faith, and how will it protect
us? Eph. 6:16; 1 Tim. 6:12.
    NoTE.—"Is Jesus true? Does He mean what He says? Answer decidedly,
Yes, every word. Then if you have settled this, by faith claim every promise
that He has made, and receive the blessing; for this acceptance by faith gives
life to the soul. You may believe that Jesus is true to you, even though you
feel yourself to be the weakest and most unworthy of His children."—Testi-
monie5 to Ministers, page 517.
     6. What two weapons complete the Christian warrior's equip-
ment? What is the sword of the Spirit? Eph. 6:17; Heb. 4:12.
                                           80
   NOTE.—"What is indicated in placing salvation in the helmet, the helmet
covering the head, the seat of the mind? It seems very clear tnat God would
have His children understand that the hope of sal,-ition is an intelligent hope,
and the helmet of salvation indicates that the child of God knows that God
will save, because he knows that he himself complies with the requirements of
the Master, and he knows that the Master's word cannot fail."—M. C. Wilcox,
Studies in Ephesians, page 1.04.
   "We need not say, The perils of the last days are soon to come upon us.
Already they have come. We need now the sword of the Lord to cut to the
very soul and marrow of fleshly lusts, appetites, and passions."—Testimonies,
vol. 8, p. 315.
    7. Where did David keep God's word, and for what purpose?
Ps. 119:11.
                         Final Admonitions
    8. How diligently should the Christian pray as he fights "the
good fight of faith?" Eph. 6:18.
    9. What lesson regarding prayer is taught us by the experience
of the sons of Reuben in battle? 1 Chron. 5:18-22.
   NOTE.—"There is necessity for diligence in prayer; let nothing hinder you.
Make every effort to keep open the communion between Jesus and your own
soul. Seek every opportunity to go where prayer is wont to be made. . . . We
should pray in the family circle ; and above all we must not neglect secret
prayer; for this is the life of the soul. It is impossible for the soul to flourish
while prayer is neglected."—Steps to Christ, page 102.
   10. What does Paul ask for himself, and why? Eph. 6:19, 20.
   11. For what purpose did Tychicus, a fellow worker of Paul, go
from Rome to Ephesus? Verses 21, 22.
   12. With what benediction does Paul close his epistle, and how
may we be included in it? Verses 23, 24.

       THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
                                    June 3 0
    This Thirteenth Sabbath Offering "overflow" is dedicated to the expar:.
sion of our work in Bible lands, where Mohammedanism prevails, and also
in the vast regions of West Africa, including Liberia, Sierra Leone, Gold
Coast, Nigeria, the Cameroons, and French Equatorial Africa, where the
False Prophet holds millions in Islamic darkness.
    The offering of the fourth quarter of 1943 contributed an "overflow"
of $32,393.13 to this difficult but fruitful field. The vastness of the territory
and the urgent needs require an even greater offering June 30. Ethiopia
must more than double its present staff to equal what it was ten years ago,
and in West Africa the budget is far less than it was ten years ago. The war
has compelled evacuation of workers end closing of hospitals and mission
stations in Ethiopia, but now the doors are open again. Let us give most
generously that these opportunities may be seized while God's mercy waits
for us to garner sheaves for His soon-coming kingdom.
                                                                                toi:74k,
