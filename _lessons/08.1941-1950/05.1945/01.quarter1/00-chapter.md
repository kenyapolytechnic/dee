                     Lesson 1, for January 6, 1945
                     The Church in All Ages
     MEMORY VERSE: "But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an
holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should show forth the praises of Him who hath
called you out of darkness into His marvelous light." 1 Peter 2:9.
     STUDY HELP: "The Acts of the Apostles," pp. 593-599.

             God's Family One in Heaven and Eartb
   1. What sacred tie binds together the family in earth and in
heaven? Eph. 3:14, 15.
   2. Through whom do we become members of this family? Eph.
2:12, 13, 18, 19.
    Nom.—"From that scene of heavenly joy, there comes back to us on earth
the echo of Christ's own wonderful words, 'I ascend unto My Father, and your
Father; and to My God, and your God.' The family of heaven and the family
of earth are one. For us our Lord ascended, and for us He lives."—The Desire
of Ages, page 835.
   3. What is the church called? 1 Tim. 3:15.
   4. Upon what sure foundation is this edifice built? Isa. 28:16;
1 Cor. 3:9-11.
    NoTE:—"To those who believe, Christ is a sure foundation. Upon this
living stone, Jews and Gentiles alike may build. It is broad enough for all, and
strong enough to sustain the weight and burden of the whole world."—The
Acts of the Apostles, page 175.
    5. Who have been built into this foundation? Eph. 2:19, 20.
   6. How may we share in constructing this building? 1 Cor.
3:12-17.
   NoTE.—"Paul and the other apostles, and all the righteous who have lived
since then, have acted their part in the building of the temple. But the struc-
ture is not yet complete. We who are living in this age have a work to do, a
part to act."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 599.
                Relation of Christ to the Church
    7. To what other figure besides that of the temple does Paul
frequently refer? Eph. 1:22, 23; Col. 1:18.
    8. How close and sympathetic should be the relationship be-
tween members? Rom. 12:4, 5; 1 Cor. 12:12-27.
                                         [8]
               The Church Before the Christian Era
    9. In the patriarchal age, what covenant did God make with
Abraham? Gen. 17:4-8.
   10. How may it be shown that God looked upon the children of
Israel in their wilderness experience as His church? Deut. 7:6;
Acts 7:38; 1 Cor. 10:1-4.
   11. What proof do we have that the believers met in local groups
in the time of David? Ps. 22:22, 25.
   NOTE.—By comparing Psalm 22:22 with the way it is quoted in Hebrews
2:12, we note that the "congregation" in which David desired to praise God
was none other than the "church" in his day.
                The Church in the Christian Era
  12. Through what parable did Jesus teach that the church of God
would be taken away from the Jewish leaders and transferred to
Christian leaders? Luke 20:9-18.
  13. In what words did Jesus announce the foundation of the
Christian church? Matt. 16:18.
   NorE.—The rock upon which the church was to be built was His own
divine Self. The statement of Peter in verse 16 was that Jesus was "the Christ,
the Son of the living God." Compare Deut. 32:4.
   14. During the long years of papal persecution from 538 A. D.
to 1798 A. D., where was the true church? Rev. 12:6, 14.
   NOTE.—"For hundreds of years the church of Christ found refuge in seclu-
sion and obscurity. Thus says the prophet: 'The woman fled into the wilder-
ness.' "—The Great Controversy, page 55.
  15. How is the last church identified in the Scriptures? Rev.
12:17; 14:12.

                   Lesson 2, for January 13, 1945
               The Remnant Church and the
                 Commandments of God
     MEMORY VERSE: "The dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make
war with the remnant of her seed, which keep The commandments of God, and have
the testimony of Jesus Christ." Rev. 12:17.
     STUDY HELPS: "The Great Controversy," pp. 582-592 (new ed., pp. 657-
667); "Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 33-43.

                     The Law of God's Kingdom
    1. What is the extent of God's government? Ps. 103:19.
    2. Who is our lawgiver? Isa. 33:22, margin.
    NorE.—The law of God is the expression of His goodness and love, a tran-
script of His character.
                                     [4]
   3. What can be said of the nature of God's law? Ps. 19:7,' 8;
Rom. 7:12.
   4. Who of heaven's inhabitants are said to be subject to God's
law? Ps. 103:20.
   5. What may be expected of the inhabitants of this earth? Eccl.
12:13. See Deut. 6:25.
     Sin—Transgression, Unrighteousness, Disobedience
   6. How do the Scriptures define sin? 1 John 3:4.
    7. Since the law of God is righteousness, what can we expect
sin to be? 1 John 5:17.
    8. What evidence have we that Satan was the first transgressor
of God's law? John 8:44.
    9. What was the result of Adam's disobedience? Rom. 5:12.
                     Perpetuity of God's Law
  10. What do the Scriptures teach regarding the perpetuity of
God's law? Ps. 111:7, 8; Matt. 5:18.
  11. What is the greatest evidence of the divinity, sacredness, per-
fection, and perpetuity of God's law? Heb. 2:9; 1 Peter 2:22-24.
   NOTE.—"It was because the law was changeless, because man could be saved
only through obedience to its precepts, that Jesus was lifted up on the cross.
Yet the very means by which Christ established the law, Satan represented
as destroying it. Here will come the last conflict of the great controversy
between Christ and Satan."—The Desire of Ages, pages 762, 763.
         Great Controversy Between Christ and Satan
  12. Since the controversy between Christ and Satan began over
the law of God, how may we expect it to close? Rev. 12:17.
  13. Though Adam and ancient Israel failed to obey God's law,
what is God expecting of the remnant church? Isa. 58:12; Rev. 14:12.
   NOTE.—"Among earth's inhabitants, scattered in every land, there are those
who have not bowed the knee to Baal. Like the stars of heaven, which appear
only at night, these faithful ones will shine forth when darkness covers the
earth and gross darkness the people. In heathen Africa, in the Catholic lands
of Europe and of South America, in China, in India, in the islands of the sea,
and in all the dark corners of the earth, God has in reserve a firmament of
chosen ones that will yet shine forth amidst the darkness, revealing clearly to an
apostate world the transforming power of obedience to His law."—Prophets
and Kings, pages 188, 189.
  14. What is the price of disobedience or obedience? Isa. 24:4, 5;
Matt. 19:16-19; Rev. 22:14.
  15. What assurance of help and of inestimable reward is offered
those who will honor God in these days when the controversy is
about to close? Isa. 51:7; Rev. 14:4, 5.
   Read Prophets and Kings, pages 186, 187.
                                       [5]
                    Lesson 3, for January 20, 1945
                The Remnant Church and the
                     Testimony of Jesus
     MEMORY VERSE: "That in everything ye are enriched by Him, in all utter-
ance, and in all knowledge; even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you: so
that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."
1 Cor. 1:5-7.
     STUDY HELPS: "Testimonies," vol. 5, pp. 654-691; "The Abiding Gift of
Prophecy," pp. 253-276.

      God's Abiding Method of Communication With Man
    1. When sin made "face to face" communication with man im-
possible, what other method of communication did God choose?
Amos 3:7.
    2. In what ways has God revealed His will through prophets?
Num. 12:6; 2 Peter 1:21; Hab. 2:2.
    3. What are the five steps in the general use of the prophetic
gift as revealed in the writing of the book of Revelation? Rev. 1:1-4.
     NOTE.—(1) The message emanates from the mind of God the Father, and
is, therefore, divinely inspired. (2) Through Jesus it is sent, by (3) His angel,
to (4) the prophet, who delivers it to (5) the church.
     By a study of Revelation 1:1 and 22:8, 9 we learn that a special angel is
appointed to deliver the prophetic message; and in Daniel 8:16 and 10:21, we
learn that this angel is Gabriel. See The Desire of Ages, pages 98, 99.
                   The Object of Spiritual Gifts
    4. When Jesus ascended to heaven, what provision did He make
for the success of His church? Eph. 4:8, 11.
    5. How many will be recipients of one or more of the gifts?
1 Cor. 12:8-11, 29-31.
    6. What reasons are given for the bestowal of spiritual gifts?
Eph. 4:12-15.
    7. Among other gifts of the Spirit, what is said to be especially
desired? 1 Cor. 14:1, 5.
    8. In calling Jeremiah to be a prophet, how did the Lord define
His work? Jer. 1:4-9.
   NOTE.—We have already noted from Amos 3:7 and Numbers 12:6 the
same thought that the prophet is the mouthpiece or messenger to communicate
God's will to man. The revelation of God's will may pertain to the past,
the present, or the future. The foretelling of the future is only the work of a
prophet so far as God desires at any time to reveal it. Many of the prophets
were leaders, statesmen, and preachers and did little or no foretelling, as, for
example, John the Baptist and Moses who were called great prophets. The
meaning of the word prophet implies one who speaks for another. The former
name of "seer," or one who sees, and then tells forth, is significant. See 1 Sam.
9:9; Ezek. 40:4.
                                     E 63
               The Prophetic Gift Through the Ages
     9. How were Old Testament prophecies given? 2 Peter 1:21.
   10. By what special method did God bring Israel out of Egypt
and preserve them? Hosea 12:13.
   11. Why was the prophetic gift apparently inoperative for many
years prior to the first advent of Jesus? Ezek. 7:26; Lam. 2:9.
   12. Give some examples of the manifestation of the gift in the
early Christian church. Acts 11:27, 28; 13:1; 21:9.
   13. If once again through well-nigh universal apostasy the gift
were inoperative through the Dark Ages, what prophecy assured
its return to the church in the last days? Joel 2:28.
   14. What special evidence is given that the church which keeps
the commandments of God would have the gift of prophecy? Rev.
12:17; 19:10.
    NOTE.—Not only is the prophetic gift closely associated with the keeping
of the commandments in a general sense, but in the 20th chapter of Ezekiel,
the violation of the fourth commandment by the Israelites and their fathers is
especially mentioned (verses 13, 16, 18-21) as a reason why the Lord refused
to answer the inquiries of the elders of Israel who came to Ezekiel in the land
of captivity (verses 3, 31).
  15. How is the final gathering of God's people predicted by the
prophet Isaiah? Isa. 11:11, 12.
    NoTE.—The sounding of the message of the third angel of Revelation 14,
in the year 1844, called forth a commandment-keeping remnant. It was then
that the gift of prophecy appeared. The first vision was given to Ellen Harmon
[later Mrs. E. G. White] in December, 1844. From that year, for over
seventy years, until her death in 1915, God used His messenger to counsel,
guide, edify, and unify the church. In keeping with the spirit of a faithful
prophet, she revealed God's messages rebuking sin and giving encouragement
to individuals and the church. Her works constitute an illuminating com-
mentary on the Scriptures. In every field of thought and study needful for
the church, abundant inspired counsel and instruction have been given. The
heeding of this counsel has advanced the spiritual welfare of the individual
church member, and has guided in the onward march of the message in all the
world. The tests of a true prophet are fully met in her experience and writ-
ings. Christ is uplifted as the only Saviour, and the Bible set forth as our
only rule of faith.


                    Lesson 4, for January 27, 1945
The Remnant Church and the Everlasting Gospel
     MEMORY VERSE: "Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of
the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you that ye
should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints."
Jude 3.
     STUDY HELP: "Education," pp. 254-261.
                                          7
              The Inspired Scriptures the Rule of Life
     1. Of what vital importance is Bible doctrine to ministry and
laity? 1 Tim. 4:6, 16; Rom. 6:17.
    Nor8.—All the doctrines of the Bible are comprehended in the funda-
mentals, or "platform" of teachings of the early advent believers. "The passing
of the time in 1844 was a period of great events, opening to our astonished
eyes the cleansing of the sanctuary transpiring in heaven, and having decided
relation to God's people upon the earth, [also] the first and second angels'
messages and the third, unfurling the banner on which was inscribed, 'The
commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.' One of the landmarks under
this message was the temple of God, seen by His truth-loving people in heaven,
and the ark containing the law of God. The light of the Sabbath of the fourth
commandment flashed its strong rays in the pathway of the transgressors
of God's law. The nonimmortality of the wicked is an old landmark. I can
call to mind nothing more that can come under the head of the old landmarks.
All this cry about changing the old landmarks is all imaginary."—Counsels
to Editors, pages 21, 22.
     2. What part have the Scriptures in the salvation of sinners?
2 Tim. 3:15-17.
    NOTE.—The Bible contains a vast fund of instruction as to (1) its im-
mutability (Matt. 5:17, 18) ; (2) being inspired by the Spirit of Christ (Luke
24:27, 44, 45; 1 Peter 1:10, 11) ; (3) being the only source of truth and life
John 6:63; Deut. 30:10-16).
     3. What is the relation of the law to the gospel? Rom. 8:1-4;
Ps. 19:7.
     Read Prophets and Kings, page 178.
     Christ emphasized the basic principles of the law. Matt. 22:36-40. The
law will be the standard of the final judgment. James 2:8-12.
      4. What is the testimony of Jesus concerning the Sabbath of the
commandments? Mark 2:27, 28.
      5. What was the example and instruction of Jesus in regard to
Sabbathkeeping? Luke 4:16; Matt. 24:15, 16, 20; 12:10-16.
     Nor8.—"Christ, during His earthly ministry, emphasized the binding claims
 of the Sabbath; in all His teaching He showed reverence for the institution
 He Himself had given."—Prophets and Kings, page 183.
                       The Plan of Salvation
   6. How was man's existence affected by his disobedience to the
law? Rom. 7:10; 5:12, 19.
   Read Patriarchs and Prophets, page 60.
    7. What is man by nature? What is God's nature? Job 4:17;
1 Tim. 1:17.
    8. What did Jesus say was the purpose of His first coming?
Luke 19:10; John 10:10, 11.
   NOTE.—"God was to be manifest in Christ, 'reconciling the world unto
Himself.' Man had become so degraded by sin that it was impossible for him,
                                   (81
in himself, to come into harmony with Him whose nature is purity and good-
ness. But Christ, after having redeemed man from the condemnation of the
law, could impart divine power, to unite with human effort. Thus by repent-
ance toward God and faith in Christ, the fallen children of Adam might once
more become 'sons of God.' "—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 64.
                 The Hope of the Remnant Church
    9. What hope did the Saviour place in the hearts of His apostles?
John 14:1-3.
   10. What signs did He say would point to His second coming?
Matt. 24:5-7, 23-34; Luke 21:25, 26.
   NorE.—In all these scriptures is taught the certainty of the personal and
imminent return of Christ. In Matt. 24:36 He makes it clear that no man
knows the day or the hour of His return. But He gives unmistakable signs
which indicate "the times and the seasons" so that we "are not in darkness, that
that day should overtake you [us] as a thief." 1 Thess. 5:1, 4. In the day of
His appearing the righteous dead will be raised, and the righteous living will
be caught up with them to meet the Lord. 1 Thess. 4:13-17. Of that hour
Christ Himself spoke. John 5:28, 29. This experience in Christ is possible,
however, only to those who truly believe and accept Christ as their Saviour.
                              The Judgment
   11. To what book of prophecy, did Christ refer the church for
study? Matt. 24:15.
    Non.—In the book of Daniel, chapters 2, 7, and 8, are three distinct lines
of prophecy leading the student down through the history of the nations to
the time of the end. In the midst of chapter 7 there is given a definite picture
of the judgment scene (verses 9-14), and the chapter closes with the setting up
of Christ's kingdom following the sitting of the judgment (verse 26).
   12. What are we told must be accounted for in the day of judg-
ment? Matt. 12:36; 25:14-19.
   13. Who presents the lives of human beings before the judgment
seat of God? Matt. 18:10.
    NoTE.—Concerning the work of angel messengers we are told, "It would be
well to consider that in all our work we have the co-operation and care of
heavenly beings. . . . By these angel messengers a faithful record is kept of the
words and deeds of the children of men. Every act of cruelty or injustice to-
ward God's people, all they are caused to suffer through the power of evil
workers, is registered in heaven."—Christ's Object Lessons, pages 176, 177.
    14. Who will be the advocate of those who have confessed their
sins and been cleansed from all unrighteousness? Matt. 10:32, 33;
1 John 2:1.
     NOTE.—"In the courts above, Christ is pleading for His church—pleading
 for those for whom He has paid the redemption price of His blood. Centuries,
ages, can never lessen the efficacy of His atoning sacrifice."—The Acts of the
 Apostles, pages .552, 553.

                   Lesson 5, for February 3, 1945

The Remnant Church and the Laodicean Message
    MEMORY VERSE: "As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous
therefore, and repent." Rev. 3:19.
    STUDY HELP: "Testimonies," vol. 1, pp. 185-195.

  The Laodicean Message Addressed to the Remnant Church
     1. What is the name of the last church to which a special mes-
sage is addressed? Rev. 3:14, first part.
    NorE.—"The names of the seven churches are symbolic of the church in
different periods of the Christian Era. The number seven indicates complete-
ness, and is symbolic of the fact that the messages extend to the end of time,
while the symbols used reveal the condition of the church at different periods
in the history of the world."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 585. The mean-
ing of the word Laodicea is "the judging of the people" or "a just people."
     2. When did the investigative judgment begin, and what decree
will mark its close? Dan. 8:14; Rev. 22:11, 12.
    No•rE.—From a study of the 2300-day prophecy we learn that the "judg-
ment hour" began in the year 1844. When Christ comes, the judgment of the
righteous must be complete, for His reward is with Him "to give every man
according as his work shall be." The great decree of Rev. 22:11 which marks
the close of probation signalizes the commencement of the pouring out of the
seven last plagues. Then Christ will have closed His mediatorial service for
man. Therefore the judgment extends from 1844 to the close of probation.
This remnant church took up its special message in 1844, and began to pro-
claim, the judgment hour. The Laodicean message is therefore addressed to this
church, the last church of God on earth. "I was shown that the testimony to
the Laodiceans applies to God's people at the present time."—Testimonies,
vol. 1, p. 186.
     3. Who is the one who sends this message? Rev. 3:14, last part.
    NOTE.—"The faithful and true Witness" is the Lord Jesus. Rev. 1:5. In
John 1:3 we are told that "all things were made by Him" (Christ), so that He
became God's• agent in the creation. "The testimony, so cutting and severe,
cannot be a mistake, for it is the True Witness who speaks, and His testimony
must be correct."—Testimonies, vol. 3, p. 253.

     Severe Reproof but Not Rejection of Whole Church
     4. What does the True Witness assert regarding His knowledge
of the church and its condition? Verse 15.
    NorE.—"Many, I saw, were flattering themselves that they were good
Christians, who have not a single ray of light from Jesus. They know not
what it is to be renewed by the grace of God. They have no living experience
for themselves in the things of God. And I saw that the Lord was whetting His
sword in heaven to cut them down. Oh that every lukewarm professor could
realize the clean work that God is about to make among His professed people I
Dear friends, do not deceive yourselves concerning your condition. You cannot
deceive God. Says the True Witness, `I know thy works.' The third angel is
                                     110]
leading up a people, step by step, higher and higher. At every step they will
be tested."—Testimonies, vol. 1, p. 190.
     5. What warning does He issue to the lukewarm? Verse 16.
     6. What way of escape is revealed? Verse 19.
    NOTE.—This severe message of rebuke is given because God loves us. The
very invitation to repent clearly proves that the judgment in verse 16 is con-
ditioned upon the repentance of the church and her return to her first works.
    "He has not left His church forsaken, but has traced in prophetic declara-
tions what would occur, and that which His Spirit inspired the prophets to
foretell has been brought about. . . . Enfeebled and defective as it may appear,
the church is the one object upon which God bestows in a special sense His
supreme regard. It is the theater of His grace, in which He delights to reveal
His power to transform hearts."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 12.
      7. What promise of Christ to the church shows that He will
never reject it? Matt. 28:20.
    Norz.—"I am encouraged and blessed as I realize that the God of Israel
is still guiding His people, and that He will continue to be with them, even to
the end."—Life Sketches, pages 437, 438.
     8. How does Christ indicate that some in the church will fail to
heed the reproof and be lost? Matt. 13:27-30, 47-50.
     NOTE.—"I asked the meaning of the shaking I had seen, and was shown that
it would be caused by the straight testimony called forth by the counsel of the
True Witness to the Laodiceans. This will have its effect upon the heart of the
receiver, and will lead him to exalt the standard and pour forth the straight
truth. Some will not bear this straight testimony. They will rise up against
it, and this will cause a shaking among God's people."—Testimonies, vol. 1,
p. 181.
     9. By whom will the message be heeded? How will it accom-
plish its purpose? Rev. 7:14.
     Read Testimonies, vol. 1, p. 186.

                        The Malady and Remedy
   10. What is the threefold charge of the True Witness against the
church? Rev. 3:15-17.
   11. What is the first remedy the True Witness offers us? Verse
18, first part.
   12. How is this remedy defined? James 2:5; Gal. 5:6; 1 Tim. 6:18.
    NorE.—"The gold here recommended as having been tried in the fire, is
faith and love. It makes the heart rich; for it has been purged until it is pure,
and the more it is tested the more brilliant is its luster."—Testimonies, vol. 4,
p. 88.
   13. What is the remedy next offered? Isa. 64:6; Rev. 19:8; Zech.
3:3, 4.
    NOTE.—"The white raiment is purity of character, the righteousness of
Christ imparted to the sinner. This is indeed a garment of heavenly texture,
                                     [ 11 ]
that can be bought only of Christ for a life of willing obedience."—Testimonies,
vol. 4, p. 88.
  14. What does the True Witness next commend to us? With
what does God anoint? Rev. 3:18, last part; Acts 10:38. See also
Eph. 1:18; Ps. 119:18.
   Nora.—"The eyesalve is that wisdom and grace which enables us to dis-
cern between the evil and the good, and to detect sin under any guise."—
Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 88.
   15. What is the earnest appeal of the True Witness? Rev. 3:19.
                        The Final Appeal
   16. In what experience only is promised the complete and most
effective transformation of Laodicea? Verse 20.
   NOTE.—Through the full submission of the heart and mind and will to
Christ, the Laodicean church will become the church triumphant. It is because
the Saviour is still outside the heart's door that there are those in Laodicea
whose condition is what the True Witness describes it to be. When we let the
Saviour in, a complete change will be effected.
  17. With what further gracious incentive does the Saviour urge
those in a Laodicean condition to change their course? Verse 21.
   NOTE.—"We can overcome. Yes; fully, entirely. Jesus died to make a way
of escape for us, that we might overcome every evil temper, every sin, every
temptation, and sit down at last with Him."—Testimonies, vol. 1, p. 144.

                The Remnant. Church and the
                    FirSt Angel's Message
     MEMORY VERSE: "I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having
the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every
nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and
give glory to Him; for the hour of His judgment is come: and worship Him that
made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters." Rev. 14:6, 7.
     STUDY HELP: "The Great Controversy," pp. 355, 356, 409-432 (new ed.,
pp. 407-409, 467-493.)

             The Messengers and Their Commission
    1. After his vision recorded in Revelation 13, concerning cer-
tain powers engaged in conflict with God's people and His truth,
what further developments did John see? Rev. 14:6, first part.
   NOTE.—"The fact that an angel is said to be the herald of this warning, is
significant. By the purity, the glory, and the power of the heavenly messenger,
divine wisdom has been pleased to represent the exalted character of the work
to be accomplished by the message, and the power and glory that were to
attend it."—The Great Controversy, page 355.
    2. What was the special work of this angel? Verse 6.
                                       [ 12
                     A Great Announcement
    3. What important announcement is to be made by the remnant
church? Because of this, what are all exhorted to do? Rev. 14:7,
first part.
     4. Show that the judgment here mentioned is the investigative
judgment which was to take place between Paul's day and the sec-
ond coming of Jesus. Acts 24:25; Matt. 25:31, 32, 34, 41.
   NorE.—In Paul's day the judgment was future. When Jesus comes, the
cases of all have been decided for weal or woe. Every judgment has an investi-
gative phase and an executive phase. Since the executive takes place at the
coming of Jesus and later, the only judgment which can take place before the
second coming must be the investigative judgment.

               The Judgment in Type and. Antitype
     5. In the sanctuary service of ancient Israel, what was the type
of this judgment? Lev. 16:15, 16, 29, 30, 34. (Read the whole chap-
ter for an understanding of this service.)
    6. When was the antitypical cleansing of the sanctuary or Day
of Atonement to begin? Dan. 8:14.
   Nom—The work performed by the high priest in cleansing the earthly
sanctuary on the Day of Atonement has always been understood by the Jewish
people to be a work of judgment.
     7. What scripture identifies the starting point and provides
other prophetic and historical dates for the time prophecies in Dan-
iel, chapters 7 to 9? Dan. 9:23-27.
    NOTE.—"The 2300 days had been found to begin when the commandment
of Artaxerxes for the restoration and building of Jerusalem, went into effect,
in the autumn of B. c. 457. Taking this as the starting point, there was perfect
harmony in the application of all the events foretold in the explanation of that
period in Daniel 9:25-27. Sixty-nine weeks, the first 483 of the 2300 years, were
to reach to the Messiah, the Anointed One; and Christ's baptism and anoint-
ing by the Holy Spirit, A. D. 27, exactly fulfilled the specification. In the midst
of the seventieth week, Messiah was to be cut off. Three and a half years after
His baptism, Christ was crucified, in the spring of A. D. 31. The seventy weeks,
or 490 years, were to pertain especially to the Jews. At the expiration of this
period, the nation sealed its rejection of Christ by the persecution of His
disciples, and the apostles turned to the Gentiles, A. D. 34. The first 490 years

years extend to 1844. 'Then,' said the angel, 'shall the sanctuary be cleansed.' "
—The Great Controversy, page 410.
    (For a day for a year, see Ezekiel 4:6 and Numbers 14:34.)
     8. What language of the Scripture indicates that the first angel's
message could not have been proclaimed before the time of the end?
Rev. 14:7.
    NorE.—"The prophecies present a succession of events leading down to the
opening of the judgment. This is especially true of the book of Daniel. But
that part of his prophecy which related to the last days, Daniel was bidden to
close up and seal 'to the time of the end.' Not till we reach this time could a
message concerning the judgment be proclaimed, based on a fulfillment of
these prophecies."—The Great Controversy, page 356.
     9. Describe the judgment scene. Dan. 7:9, 10.
                        Creation and the Sabbath
    10. What is the standard of the judgment? James 2:10-12.
    11. Whom are men bidden to worship in the first angel's mes-
sage? Rev. 14:7, last part.
    NOTE.—The wonderful applicability of the message to the present hour is
brought to view in this appeal to worship God as Creator. Under the specula-
tive, but unproved doctrine of evolution, a theory and not a fact of science,
nearly the whole educated world has rejected the Biblical fact of a divine
creation. To accept the theory that man has evolved from lower orders of
animal life, and is therefore a product of irresponsible circumstance is to deny
the creation of man as an intelligent free moral agent. To do this is to destroy
the Bible teaching of the origin of sin and to make of no effect the cross of Cal-
vary and the whole plan of redemption. The call of the hour is to bring man
back to God and His inspired word.
    12. To what portion of God's law which is, especially disregarded
does this appeal draw particular attention? Ex. 20:8-11; Isa. 58:13,
14.
    13. How can man best show faith in the Creator who is revealed
in the first chapter of Genesis? Gen. 2:1-3. See also Ex. 31:14-17.
    NOTE.—" 'The importance of the Sabbath as a memorial of creation is that
it keeps ever present the true reason why worship is due to God,'—because He
is the Creator, and we are His creatures. 'The Sabbath, therefore, lies at the
very foundation of divine worship; for it teaches this great truth in the most
impressive manner, and no other institution does this. The true ground of
divine worship, not of that on the seventh day merely, but of all worship, is
found in the distinction between the Creator and His creatures. This great fact
can never become obsolete, and must never be forgotten.' It was to keep this
truth ever before the minds of men, that God instituted the Sabbath in Eden;
and so long as the fact that He is our Creator continues to be a reason why we
should worship Him, so long the Sabbath will continue as its sign and memo-
rial."—The Great Controversy, pages 437, 438.

                The Remnant Church and the
                   Second Angel's Message
     MEMORY VERSE: "There followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen,
is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath
of her fornication." Rev. 14:8.
     STUDY HELP: "The Great Controversy," pp. 381-390 (new ed., pp. 434-445).

                   The Second Angel's Message
   1. What pronouncement' does the second angel make? Rev.
14:8, first part.
    2. What is the first mention in the Scriptures of the name Baby-
lon? Gen. 10:9, 10.
    NoTE.—The margin explains that "Babylon" is the Greek word derived
from the Hebrew word "Babel." The location of this city is given as the plain
of Shinar or the land of the Chaldees on the banks of the river Euphrates.
In this first mention of Babylon or Babel, we find the spirit of rebellion against
God.
    3. How did God show His disapproval of the building of the
Tower of Babel? What is the meaning of the term? Gen. 11:8, 9.
*(See margin—Babel or Babylon.---confusion.)
    4. Under what king did the ancient universal empire of Baby-
lon, which occupied this territory, attain the height of its wealth
and glory? Dan. 2:1, 37, 38.
    5. What spirit led to his downfall? Dan. 4:30.
    6. What were the sins of ancient Babylon that brought upon her
the judgments of God? Jer. 51:6, 7, 11, 13; Dan. 5:17-31.
    NorE.—Pride, covetousness, apostasy, drunkenness, and disregard of the
truth and sacred things brought about the downfall of Babylon.
                Babylon—the Mother of Harlots
    7. What is Babylon represented to be in Revelation 17:3-5?
    8. What are some of the marks which clearly identify the Baby-
lon of this chapter as papal Rome? Rev. 17:1-6, 15, 18.
    NoTE.—"Says the prophet, 'I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the
saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus.' Babylon is further declared
to be 'that great, city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth' The power
that for so many centuries maintained despotic sway over the monarchs of
Christendom, is Rome. The purple and scarlet color, the gold and precious
stones and pearls, vividly picture the magnificence and more than kingly pomp
affected by the haughty see of Rome."—The Great Controversy, page 382.
                          Modern Babylon
    9. What inference can legitimately be drawn from the statement
that Babylon is said to be the mother of harlots?
                                         [ 15 ]
    Answer: That she must have daughters.
    NorE.—"Babylon is said to be 'the mother of harlots.' By her daughters
must be symbolized churches that cling to her doctrines and traditions, and
follow her example of sacrificing the truth and the approval of God, in order
to form an unlawful alliance with the world."—The Great Controversy,
pages 382, 383.
   10. Why must the second angel's message refer to others than
Rome, the mother?
    Answer: Long before 1844, the Church of Rome had fallen. It had also
been identified by the Scriptures as an apostate church. Babylon in its original
or pagan form was apostasy and corruption from its beginning. "The message
of Revelation 14, announcing the fall of Babylon, must apply to religious
bodies that were once pure and have become corrupt. Since this message
follows the warning of the judgment, it must be given in the last days; there-
fore it cannot refer to the Roman Church alone, for that church has been in
a fallen condition for many centuries. . . . At the time of their rise, these
churches took a noble stand for God and the truth, and His blessing was with
them. . . . But they fell by the same desire which was the curse and ruin of
Israel,—the desire of imitating the practices and courting the friendship of the
ungodly."—The Great Controversy, page 383.
    The answer to the question of why a similar pronouncement was not made
earlier, is to be found in the fact that the third or modern phase of Babylon
had not yet taken place. "The second angel's message of Revelation 14 was
first preached in the summer of 1844, and it then had a more direct application
to the churches of the United States, where the warning of the judgment had
been most widely proclaimed and most generally rejected, and where the de-
clension in the churches had been most rapid."—Ibid., page 389.
    11. Under the symbol of a city, into how many divisions is Baby-
lon said to be divided? Rev. 16:19.
    NorE.—Since the second angel's message includes Protestant churches which
are following in the footsteps of Rome in doctrinal apostasy and worldliness,
we see that Babylon is comprised of three great sections—paganism,•Catholi-
cism, and apostate Protestantism. A similar division is brought to view in
Revelation 16:13, where the dragon stands for paganism, the beast for Catholi-
cism, and the false prophet for apostate Protestantism.
    12. What further proof is there that the term Babylon embraces
the entire counterfeit or false religious systems of earth? Rev. 18:24.
                           The Sins of Babylon
   13. What is Babylon charged with doing? Rev. 14:8, last part.
    NOTE.—The idea of the poisoned cup of fornication and intoxication offered
by Babylon carries through all its history—ancient, medieval, and modern.
"The great sin charged against Babylon is, that she 'made all nations drink of
the wine of the wrath of her fornication.' This cup of intoxication which she
presents to the world, represents the false doctrines that she has accepted as
the result of her unlawful connection with the great ones of the earth. Friend-
ship with the world corrupts her faith, and in her turn she exerts a corrupting
influence upon the world by teaching doctrines which are opposed to the
plainest statements of Holy Writ."—The Great Controversy, page 388.
                                     [ 16 ]
   14. What false doctrines are brought to light through the preach-
ing of the truth by the remnant church?
    Answer: 1. The effort to abrogate God's law. 2. The attempt to'substitute
Sunday for God's Sabbath. 3. The immortality of man's soul. 4. The theory
of eternal torment. 5. The postponement of Christ's second appearing. 6. The
rejection of the purely spiritual functions of the church for alliance with the
state and the world to obtain power among men. 7. Seeking the favor of the
world rather than the power of God's Spirit.
                          The Fall Not Complete
    15. What indicates that the fall of Babylon was not yet complete?
Rev. 14:8; 18:4.
     NOTE.—Not as yet have all nations drunk of "the wine of the wrath of her
fornication." Not yet have all heard the call, "Come out of her, My people." We
are told:
     "The message of the second angel did not reach its complete fulfillment in
1844. The churches then experienced a moral fall, in consequence of their
refusal of the light of the advent message ; but that fall was not complete. As
they have continued to reject the special truths for this time, they have fallen
lower and lower. Not yet, however, can it be said that 'Babylon is fallen,
. . . because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her forni-
cation.' She has not yet made all nations do this. . . . The change is a pro-
gressive one, and the perfect fulfillment of Revelation 14:8 is yet future."—The
Great Controversy, pages 389, 390.


                    Lesson 8, for February 24, 1945
                The Remnant Church and the
                   Third Angel's Message
     MEMORY VERSE: "The third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice,
If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or
in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out
without mixture into the cup of His indignation." Rev. 14:9, ID, first part.
     STUDY HELP: "Daniel and the Revelation," Smith, pp. 663-676, ed. 1912.

                                 The Beast
    1. In contrast to the class who worship God as creator, against
whom does the third angel utter a solemn and fearful warning?
Rev. 14:9, 10, first part.
    2. What beast is here referred to? Rev. 13:1.
   NoTE.—Two are beasts brought to view in Revelation 13. The second
makes an image to the first beast. Therefore the first beast of Revelation 13 is
unmistakably the beast referred to in Revelation 14:9.
    3. What are some of the positive identification marks which
prove the beast to be papal Rome? Rev. 13:1-10, 18.
   Non.-1. Verse 1. It rises up out of the sea. Rev. 17:15,—the turbulent
sea of peoples and nations of Europe. 2. Rev. 13:1. Monarchical in character

Therefore a religio-political power. 4. Verse 2. Occupies seat of and receives
power from imperial Rome. 5. Verse 5. A blasphemous power which claims to
forgive sins and claims its leader is God. 6. Verses 5, 7. A persecuting power.
Under these persecutions which lasted for 42 months, 1260 prophetic days or
1260 literal years from A. D. 538 to A. D. 1798, it is estimated that many millions
of God's people lost their lives. 7. Verse 7. Exercised overlordship over Euro-
pean nations for centuries. 8. Verses 3, 10. Received its deadly wound in 1798.
"This period . . . began with the supremacy of the papacy, A. D. 538, and
terminated in 1798. At that time, the pope was made captive by the French
army, the papal power received its deadly wound, and the prediction was ful-
filled, 'He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity.' "-The Great
Controversy, page 439. 9. Verse 18. Its number is 666-VICARIUS FILII
DEI (Vicar of the Son of God)-a title of the pope. 10. Deadly wound would

                         The Image of the Beast
    4. What power makes the image to the beast? Verses 11, 14.
    5. Whence comes this two-horned beast? What power does it
represent? Verse 11.
    Nom-Verses 10, 11. The prophet sees it rise at the time the deadly wound
is inflicted upon the first beast. "What nation of the New World was in 1798
rising into power, giving promise of strength and greatness, and attracting the
attention of the world? The application of the symbol admits of no question.
One nation, and only one, meets the specifications of this prophecy; it points
unmistakably to the United States of America."-The Great Controversy,
page 440.
   6. What change does the prophecy say will take place in the
character of this beast with lamblike horns? Verses 11, 12.
    Noix.-"The prediction that it will speak 'as a dragon,' and exercise 'all
the power of the first beast,' plainly foretells a development of the spirit of
intolerance and persecution that was manifested by the nations represented by
the dragon and the leopardlike beast. And the statement that the beast with
two horns `causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the
first beast,' indicates that the authority of this nation is to be exercised in
enforcing some observance which shall be an act of homage to the papacy."-
The Great Controversy, page 442.
    7. What will this beast endeavor to do? Verse 14.
   NOTE.-"The   'speaking' of the nation is the action of its legislative and
judicial authorities."-The Great Controversy, page 442. " 'Saying to them
that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast.' Here is
clearly presented a form of government in which the legislative power rests
with the people; a most striking evidence that the United States is the nation
denoted in the prophecy."-Ibid., page 443.
     8. What is the image of the beast?
     Answer: "But what is the 'image to the beast'? and how is it to be formed?
The image is made by the two-horned beast, and is an image to the first beast.
It is also called an image of the beast. Then to learn what the image is like,
                                      [ 18 ]
and how it is to be formed, we must study the characteristics of the beast
itself,—the papacy."—The Great Controversy, page 443. "The 'image to the
beast' represents that form of apostate Protestantism which will be developed
when the Protestant churches shall seek the aid of the civil power for the
enforcement of their dogmas."—/bid., page 445.
     9. What outstanding trend has been prophesied for the last
days? Isa. 8:9-12.
    NoTE.—It is under this trend toward confederacy that the image of the
beast will be created. "When the leading churches of the United States, uniting
upon such points of doctrine as are held by them in common, shall influence
the state to enforce their decrees and to sustain their institutions, then Protes-
tant America will have formed an image of the Roman hierarchy, and the
infliction of civil penalties upon dissenters will inevitably result."—The Great
Controversy, page 445.
                          The Mark of the Beast
   10. Speaking of the first beast (the papacy), what did the prophet
Daniel reveal he would think to do? Dan. 7:25.                            •
    NorE.—"The papacy has attempted to change the law of God. . . . An
intentional, deliberate change is presented: 'He shall think to change the times
and the law' The change in the fourth commandment exactly fulfills the
prophecy. For this the only authority claimed is that of the church. Here the
papal power openly sets itself above God."—The Great Controversy, page 446.
   11. In contradistinction to those who receive the mark of the
beast, what class did John see in vision? Rev. 14:12.
    NOTE.—"John was called to behold a people distinct from those who wor-
ship the beast or his image by keeping the first day of the week. The observ-
ance of this day is the mark of the beast. John declares, 'Here is the patience
of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the
faith of Jesus.'"—Testimonies to Ministers, page 133.
   12. How far will the two-horned beast go in the enforcement of
the worship and mark of the beast? Rev. 13:15, 16.
   13. When does an individual receive the mark of the beast?
    Answer: "When Sunday observance shall be enforced by law, and the
world shall be enlightened concerning the obligation of the true Sabbath, then
whoever shall transgress the command of God, to obey a precept which has no
higher authority than that of Rome, will thereby honor popery above God.
He is paying homage to Rome, and to the power which enforces the institution
ordained by Rome. He is worshiping the beast and his image. As men then
reject the institution which God has declared to be the sign of His authority,
and honor in its stead that which Rome has chosen as the token of her suprem-
acy, they will thereby accept the sign of allegiance to Rome—`the mark of the
beast.' And it is not until the issue is thus plainly set before the people, and
they are brought to choose between the commandments of God and the com-
mandments of men, that those who continue in transgression will receive 'the
mark of the beast' "—The Great Controversy, page 449.
   14. What mark or sign or seal will those receive who reject the
mark of the beast? Rev. 7:3.
                                        19
  15. What dire punishment will be inflicted upon those who wor-
ship the beast and his image and receive his mark? Rev. 14:10, 11.
    NoTE.—The punishment is twofold. (a) The unmingled wrath of God
under the seven last plagues. Dan. 12:1. Note that the only time God's wrath
is unmingled with mercy is when Christ has ceased to be man's mediator. Ezek.
9:5, 10. This is when the great decree of Rev. 22:11 goes forth (see also Zeph.
2:2). This closes probation and marks the beginning of the time in which the
seven last plagues fall. (b) The final destruction of the wicked.

   1. While the mark of the beast is being forced upon the world,
what work is God carrying forward in the earth? Rev. 7:2, 3.
  NOTE.—"The Sabbath will be the great test of loyalty; for it is the point of
truth especially controverted. When the final test shall be brought to bear
upon men, then the line of distinction will be drawn between those who serve
God and those who serve Him not. . . . While one class, by accepting the sign
of submission to earthly powers, receive the mark of the beast, the other,
choosing the token of allegiance to divine authority, receive the seal of God."—
The Great Controversy, page 605.

3:12; Dan. 6:8.
    4. What portion of the Decalogue contains the seal of God?
Ex. 20:8-11.
   NOTE.—"The fourth commandment is the only one of all the ten in which
are found both the name and the title of the Lawgiver. It is the only one that
shows by whose authority the law is given. Thus it contains the seal of God,
affixed to His law as evidence of its authenticity and binding force."—Patri-
archs and Prophets, page 307.
    5. What act distinguishes the true God and Lawgiver from all
false gods? Jer. 10:10-12; Ps. 96:5; Rev. 14:7.

    8. When in sincerity we hallow the Sabbath, what knowledge
comes to us? Ezek. 20:20.

                   The Time of the Sealing
  12. When is the final sealing work begun? Rev. 7:1-3.
  NOTE.—"John sees the elements of nature—earthquake, tempest, and
political strife—represented as being held by four angels. These winds are
under control until God gives the word to let them go. There is the safety of
God's church. The angels of God do His bidding, holding back the winds of
the earth, that the winds should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor
on any tree, until the servants of God should be sealed in their foreheads."—
Testimonies to Ministers, page 444.
   13. What takes place when the angels let go the winds of strife?
Jer. 4:19, 20; Rev. 16:14, 16.
   NOTE.—"The restraining Spirit of God is even now being withdrawn from
the world. Hurricanes, storms, tempests, fire and flood, disasters by sea and
land, follow each other in quick succession. Science seeks to explain all these.
The signs thickening around us, telling of the near approach of the Son of God,
are attributed to any other than the true cause. Men cannot discern the
sentinel angels restraining the four winds that they shall not blow until the
servants of God are sealed; but when God shall bid His angels loose the winds,
there will be such a scene of strife as no pen can picture."—Testimonies, vol. 6,
p. 408.

  16. What is the faith and practice of those who reject the mark of
the beast? Rev. 14:12.
                               [ 21 ]

                      The Angel of Revelation 18
      -
     1. Under what symbol is great power represented as coming
to the remnant church? What will be the result of this bestowal?
Rev. 18:1.
    NOTE.—"As foretold in the eighteenth of Revelation, the third angel's
message is to be proclaimed with great power by those who give the final warn-
ing against the beast and his image. . . . This is the message given by God to
be sounded forth in the loud cry of the third angel."—Testimonies, vol. 8,
p. 118.
     2. What message does this angel proclaim with a loud cry?
Verses 2, 3.
    NOTE.—"The work of this angel comes in at the right time to join in the
last great work of the third angel's message, as it swells to a loud cry. And
the people of God are thus prepared to stand in the hour of temptation, which
they are soon to meet. I saw a great light resting upon them, and they united,.
to fearlessly proclaim the third angel's message."—Early Writings, page 277.
     3. What very urgent call is made to the children of God still in
Babylon? What reasons are given for this invitation? Verses 4, 5.
    NOTE.—"God still has a people in Babylon; and before the visitation of
His judgments, these faithful ones must be called out, that they 'partake not
of her sins, and receive not of her plagues.' "—The Great Controversy, page
604.
   . 4. What judgment is pronounced upon Babylon immediately

   Nora.—"Henceforth through the Spirit, Christ was to abide continually in
the hearts of His children. Their union with Him was closer than when He
was personally with them."—Steps to Christ, page 80.
     7. How does the latter rain compare with the former rain?
Joel 2:23.
    NOTE.—"So it may be now. Let Christians put away all dissension, and
give themselves to God for the saving of the lost. Let them ask in faith for
the promised blessing, and it will come. The outpouring of the Spirit in the
days of the apostles was the 'former rain,' and glorious was the result. But the
latter rain will be more abundant."—Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 21.
   8. How great will be the power attending the gift of the Holy .
Spirit in the outpouring of the latter rain? Matt. 28:18, 20; Eph.
3:16, 19.
   9. What abundant fruitage is promised? What will be the uni-
versal result? Joel 2:24-27; Rev. 18:1.
       Preparation Necessary to Receive the Latter Rain
   10. What are God's children to do in the time of the latter rain?
What is God's promise? Zech. 10:1.
    NorE.—"But near the close of earth's harvest, a special bestowal of
spiritual grace is promised to prepare the church for the coming of the Son
of man. This outpouring of the Spirit is likened to the falling of the latter
rain; and it is for this added power that Christians are to send their petitions
to the Lord of the harvest 'in the time of the latter rain' In response, 'the
Lord shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain.' He will cause
to come down . . . the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain.' "—The Acts
of the Apostles, page 55.
   11. What conditions did Peter lay down for receiving the Holy
Spirit? Acts 2:38.
   NoTE.—"There are many who believe and profess to claim the Lord's
promise; they talk about Christ and about the Holy Spirit, yet receive no
benefit. They do not surrender the soul to be guided and controlled by the
divine agencies. We cannot use the Holy Spirit. The Spirit is to use us."—The
Desire of Ages, page 672.
   12. What earnest work must be accomplished in preparation to
receive the latter rain? Hosea 10:12.
   NorE.—"The latter rain, ripening earth's harvest, represents the spiritual
grace that prepares the church for the coming of the Son of man. But unless the
former rain has fallen, there will be no life; the green blade will not spring up.
Unless the early showers have done their work, the latter rain can bring no
seed to perfection. . . .
   "Many have in a great measure failed to receive the former rain. They
have not obtained all the benefits that God has thus provided for them. They
expect that the lack will be supplied by the latter rain. When the richest abun-
dance of grace shall be bestowed, they intend to open their hearts to receive it.
They are making a terrible mistake. The work that God has begun in the
human heart in giving His light and knowledge, must be continually going
                                      [23]
forward. Every individual must realize his own necessity. The heart must be
emptied of every defilement, and cleansed for the indwelling of the Spirit."—
Testimonies to Ministers, pages 506, 507.
   13. When only can we expect additional blessings from the Lord?
Luke 16:10. (See the parable of the talents, Luke 19:12-26.)
    NOTE.—"But there must be no neglect of the grace represented by the
former rain. Only those who are living up to the light they have, will receive
greater light. Unless we are daily advancing in the exemplification of the
active Christian virtues, we shall not recognize the manifestations of the Holy
Spirit in the latter rain. It may be falling on hearts all around us, but we
shall not discern or receive it."—Testimonies to Ministers, page 507.
                   The Great Reformatory Movement
    14. How will God finish His work? Zech. 4:6.
    NoTE.—Zerubbabel was governor of the company which returned to Judea
and rebuilt the temple. The Lord uses Zerubbabel as a type of His remnant
church who are to finish the building of His spiritual temple. Zech. 4:7-10.
As we carefully study Zechariah four, we observe that while the Holy Spirit
is the- oil, the power which finishes the work, the members of the church are
the agents He uses. Read with this note Testimonies to Ministers, pages 509,
510.

         The Remnant Church and Its Dangers
    MEMORY VERSE: "Cast not away therefore your confidence, which bath
great recompense of reward. For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done
the will of God, ye might receive the promise. For yet a little while, and He that shall
come will come, and will not tarry. Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man
draw back, My soul shall have no pleasure in him. But we are not of them who draw
back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul." Heb. 10:35-39.

            Apostasy Through Opposition to Organization
      1. Of what type of apostasy were Korah, Dathan, and Abiram
guilty? Num. 16:1-3.
     NOTE.—"When Korah, Dathan, and Abiram rebelled against the authority
of Moses, they thought they were opposing only a human leader, a man like
themselves; and they came to believe that they were verily doing God service.
But in rejecting God's chosen instrument, they rejected Christ; they insulted
the Spirit of God. So, in the days of Christ, the Jewish scribes and elders, who
professed great zeal for the honor of God, crucified His Son. The same spirit
still exists in the hearts of those who set themselves to follow their own will in
opposition to the will of God."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 635.
    "The worst enemies we have are those who are trying to destroy the influ-
ence of the watchmen upon the walls of Zion."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 294.
      2. Who has appointed the leadership of the church? 1 Cor.
12:28.
                                        [ 24 1
    NOTE.—"God has a church, and she has a divinely appointed ministry.
`And He gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and
some, pastors and teachers."—Testimonies to Ministers, page 52.
     3. How is the church counseled to regard its leadership? 1
Thess. 5:12, 13; Heb. 13:7, 17.
    NoTE.—"God has placed in the church, as His appointed helpers, men of
varied talents, that through the combined wisdom of many, the mind of the
Spirit may be met. Men who move in accordance with their own strong traits
of character, refusing to yoke up with others who have had a long experience
in the work of God, will become blinded by self-confidence, unable to discern
between the false and the true."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 279.
     4. What is at the root of this type of apostasy? 3 John 9, 10.
     5. What is God's method for selecting the leadership of the
church? Acts 13:2, 3.
    NoTE.—"God has made His church on the earth a channel of light, and
through it He communicates His purposes and His will. He does not give to
one of His servants an experience independent of and contrary to the experi-
ence of the church itself. Neither does He give one man a knowledge of His
will for the entire church, while the church—Christ's body—is left in dark-
ness. In His providence, He places His servants in close connection with His
church, in order that they may have less confidence in themselves, and greater
confidence in others whom He is leading out to advance His work."—The Acts
of the Apostles, page 163.
   6. What is God's desire for the church? John 17:21; 1 Cor. 1:10.
   Read Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 236.
                            The Source of Light
     7. What relationship will all "new light" bear to truth already
revealed? Isa. 8:20.
    NOTE.—"New light" will not contradict the well-established landmarks of
the message.
   "Satan hopes to involve the remnant people of God in the general ruin
that is coming upon the earth. As the coming of Christ draws nigh, he will be
more determined and decisive in his efforts to overthrow them. Men and
women will arise professing to have some new light or some new revelation
whose tendency is to unsettle faith in the old landmarks. Their doctrines will
not bear the test of God's word, yet souls will be deceived. False reports will
be circulated, and some will be taken in this snare."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 295.
     8. Through what channel does God bring "light" to the church?
Acts 9:6, 10-12.
    NOTE.—"To neglect or despise those whom God has appointed to bear the
responsibilities of leadership in connection with the advancement of the truth,
is to reject the means that He has ordained for the help, encouragement, and
strength of His people. For any worker in the Lord's cause to pass these by,
and to think that his light must come through no other channel than directly
from God, is to place himself in a position where he is liable to be deceived
by the enemy, and overthrown."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 164.
                                       25
     9. What is the only course of safety in the promulgation and
reception of new light? Prov. 11:14.
   NorE.—"There are a thousand temptations in disguise prepared for those
who have the light of truth; and the only safety for any of us is in receiving
no new doctrine, no new interpretation of the Scriptures, without first sub-
mitting it to brethren of experience. Lay it before them in a humble, teach-
able spirit, with earnest prayer; and if they see no light in it, yield to their
judgment; for 'in the multitude of counselors there is safety.'"—Testimonies,
vol. 5, p. 293.
                            Causes of Apostasy
   10. How is the necessity of really knowing the truth brought
forcibly to us in the warning given through Hosea? Hosea 4:6.
    NorE.—"Many who profess to have a knowledge of present truth, know
not what they believe. They do not understand the evidences of their faith.
They have no just appreciation of the work for the present time."—Testi-
monies, vol. 5, p. 707.
   11. What will happen to those who fail to live up to the light
they have received? John 12:35, 36.
    NOTE.—"Those who have had great light and precious privileges, but have
not improved them, will, under one pretext or another, go out from us. Not
having received the love of the truth, they will be taken in the delusions of
the enemy; they will give heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils, and
will depart from the faith. But, on the other hand, when the storm of persecu-
tion really breaks upon us, the true sheep will hear the True Shepherd's voice."
—Testimonies, vol. 6, pp. 400, 401.
   12. Against what opposite danger should we be guarded? Eccl.
7:16; 1 Cor. 9:26, 27.
    NOTE.—"As the end draws near, the enemy will work with all his power to
bring in fanaticism among us. He would rejoice to see Seventh-day Adventists
going to such extremes that they would be branded by the world as a body
of fanatics. Against this danger I am bidden to warn ministers and lay mem-
bers. Our work is to teach men and women to build on a true foundation, to
plant their feet on a plain 'Thus saith the Lord.' "—Gospel Workers, page 316.
                         The Nature of Apostasy
   13. What must be added to a knowledge of the truth for the be-
liever to be saved? 2 Thess. 2:10.
   14. Whom only will apostasy sift out? 2 Tim. 2:16-19; 1 John
2:19.
    NoTE.—"God will arouse His people; if other means fail, heresies will
come in among them, which will sift them, separating the chaff from the
wheat."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 707.
   15. What counsel does the apostle Paul give us? 1 Tim. 4:16;
Eph. 4:14; Col. 2:6-8.
    NOTE.—"It is as certain that we have the truth as that God lives; and
Satan, with all his arts and hellish power, cannot change the truth of God into
a lie. . . . The Lord has singled us out, and made us subjects of His mar-
velous mercy. Shall we be charmed with the pratings of the apostate?"—

  The Remnant Church in the Time of Trouble
     MEMORY VERSE: "Because thou hast kept the word of My patience, I also

thou hast, that no man take thy crown." Rev. 3:10, 11.
     STUDY HELPS: "The Great Controversy," pp. 582-592, 603-634 (new ed.,
pp. 657-667, 681-715); "Testimonies," vol. 5, pp. 449-454.

                             Times of Trouble
     1. Why will the last days of earth's history be filled with
trouble? Rev. 12:12.
    NOTE—"We are near the close of time, when Satan has come down, having
great wrath, knowing that his time is short."—Testimonies, vol. 3, p. 407.
     2. What may the remnant church expect before the end? Verse
17.
                                   Spiritism
     3. What agencies will Satan use very extensively in the last
days? Rev. 16:14.
    NOTE.—"Through spiritualism, Satan appears as a benefactor of the race,
healing the diseases of the people, and professing to present a new and more
exalted system of religious faith; but at the same time he works as a destroyer.
His temptations are leading multitudes to ruin. Intemperance dethrones
reason ; sensual indulgence, strife, and bloodshed follow. Satan delights in
war; for it excites the worst passions of the soul, and then sweeps into eter-
nity its victims steeped in vice and blood. It is his object to incite the nations
to war against one another; for he can thus divert the minds of the people
from the work of preparation to stand in the day of God."—The Great Con-
troversy, page 589.
     4. What large religious bodies will embrace spiritism? Why?
Verse 13; 2 Thess. 2:9, 10.
    Norc.—"Through the agency of spiritualism, miracles will be wrought,
the sick will be healed, and many undeniable wonders will be performed.
And as the spirits will profess faith in the Bible, and manifest respect for the
institutions of the church, their work will be accepted as a manifestation of
divine power. . . . Papists, Protestants, and worldlings -will alike accept the
 form of godliness without the power, and they will see in this union a grand
 movement for the conversion of the world, and the ushering in of the long-
expected millennium."—The Great Controversy, pages 588, 589.
      5. What will be the crowning act in the drama of deception?
2 Cor. 11:14, 15; Matt. 24:23-26.
    Norc.—"As the crowning act in the great drama of deception, Satan him-
 self will personate Christ. The church has long professed to look to the
 Saviour's advent as the consummation of her hopes. Now the great deceiver
 will make it appear that Christ has come. . . . Satan is not permitted to
 counterfeit the manner of Christ's advent. The Saviour has warned His
 people against deception upon this point, and has clearly foretold the manner
 of His second coming."—The Great Controversy, pages 624, 625.
                                         271
              Sunday Laws and the Close of Probation
    6. What will be the point of issue in the final conflict? Rev.
14:9-12.
   NOTE.—The people of God will in obedience to God's requirements be
keeping all the commandments including the fourth. Those who have not
yielded obedience to God will receive the mark of the beast. "It is on the law
of God that the last great struggle of the controversy between Christ and His
angels and Satan and his angels will come, and it will be decisive for all the
world."—Christian Service, page 155.
     7. What course will apostate Protestantism follow? Rev. 13:12,
14.
    NOTE.—"Through the two great errors, the immortality of the soul and
Sunday sacredness, Satan will bring the people under his deceptions. While
the former lays the foundation of spiritualism, the latter creates a bond of
sympathy with Rome. The Protestants of the United States will be foremost
in stretching their hands across the gulf to grasp the hand of spiritualism;
they will reach over the abyss to clasp hands with the Roman power; and
under the influence of this threefold union, this country will follow in the
steps of Rome in trampling on the rights of conscience."—The Great Con-
troversy, page 588.
     8. How universal will be the acceptance of• papal falsehoods?
Rev. 18:3.
    NoTE.—"But in this homage to papacy the United States will not be alone.
The influence of Rome in the countries that once acknowledged her dominion,
is still far from being destroyed. . . . In both the Old and the New World, the
papacy will receive homage in the honor paid to the Sunday institution, that
rests solely upon the authority of the Roman Church."—The Great Con-
troversy, page 579. •
     9. While remaining steadfast to the truth, how should the
people of God relate themselves to persecution? Matt. 10:16, 23.
   10. How long will probation linger? Rev. 7:1-3.
    NOTE.—"Everything in our world is in agitation. There are wars, and
rumors of wars. The nations are angry, and the time of the dead has come,
that they should be judged. Events are changing to bring about the day of
God, which hasteth greatly. . . . As yet the four winds are held until the
servants of God shall be sealed in their foreheads. Then the powers of earth
will marshal their forces for the last great battle."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 14.
   11. What decree goes forth in heaven when apostasy becomes
universal? Rev. 22:10, 11.
    NorE.—"The substitution of the laws of men for the law of God, the
exaltation, by merely human authority, of Sunday in place of the Bible Sab-
bath, is the last act in the drama. When this substitution becomes universal,
God will reveal Himself. . . . He will come out of His place to punish the
inhabitants of the world for their iniquity, and the earth shall disclose her
blood, and shall no more cover her slain."—Testimonies, vol. 7, p. 141.
  12. What strange work does God then do? Isa. 28:18-22.
                                     [28]
                         Fleeing From the Cities
   13. What counsel did Jesus give the early disciples regarding the
destruction of Jerusalem? What parallel is drawn for us today?
Matt. 24:15-18.
    NOTE.—"The time is not far distant, when, like the early disciples, we
shall be forced to seek a refuge in desolate and solitary places. As the siege of
Jerusalem by the Roman armies was the signal for flight to the Judean Chris-
tians, so the assumption of power on the part of our nation, in the decree en-
forcing the papal sabbath, will be a warning to us. It will then be time to leave
the large cities, preparatory to leaving the smaller ones for retired homes in
secluded places among the mountains. And now, instead of seeking expen-
sive dwellings here, we should be preparing to move to a better country, even
a heavenly."—Testimonies, vol. 5, pp. 464, 465.
   14. What course will Sunday legislation finally take? Rev. 13:17,
15; Jer. 30:5-7.
    Read Early Writings, pages 36, 37.
   15. Where will the people of God finally find refuge? What
assurance of provision is given them? Isa. 33:16. (See margin for
"on high.")
    NOTE.—"As the decree issued by the various rulers of Christendom against
commandment keepers shall withdraw the protection of government, and
abandon them to those who desire their destruction, the people of God will flee
from the cities and villages and associate together in companies, dwelling in
the most desolate and solitary places. Many will find refuge in the strong-
holds of the mountains."—The Great Controversy, page 626.
   16. Where only will there be deliverance in that day? Joel 2:32.
    Read Early Writings, page 56.

                    Lesson 13, for March 31, 1945
            The Remnant Church Triumphant
     MEMORY VERSE: "Because he hath set his love upon Me, therefore will I
deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known My name. He shall call
upon Me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him,
and honor him. With long life will I satisfy him, and show him My salvation."
Ps. 91:14-16.
     STUDY HELP: "The Great Controversy," pp. 635-678 (new ed., pp. 717-762).

    2. Despite almost insurmountable difficulties, what divine proc-
lamation guarantees the completion of the work by the church?
Rev. 7:1-3.
    3. In what convincing words did Jesus promise the survival of
the church against the accumulated forces of evil? Matt. 16:18.
   NOTE.—"The church is God's agency for the proclamation of truth, em-
powered by Him to do a special work; and if she is loyal to Him, obedient to
                                      [ 29 ]
all His commandments, there will dwell within her the excellency of divine
grace. If she will be true to her allegiance, if she will honor the Lord God of
Israel, there is no power that can stand against her."—The Acts of the Apostles,
page 600.
   4. What spiritual weapon has the Lord placed in our hands to
give us victory over the world? 1 John 5:4.
   NoTE.—"We are in the time when tribulations such as the world has never
yet seen shall prevail. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea; for
the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that
he bath but a short time.' But God has set bounds that Satan cannot pass.
Our most holy faith is this barrier; and if we build ourselves up in the faith,
we shall be safe in the keeping of the Mighty One."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 297.
   5. If we are faithful to God, what does He promise to do for the
church and against our enemies? Isa. 51:7, 8, 6.
  NOTE.—"If the church will put on the robe of Christ's righteousness, with-
drawing from all allegiance with the world, there is before her the dawn of a
bright and glorious day. God's promise to her will stand fast forever. He will
make her an eternal excellency, a joy of many generations."—The Acts of the
Apostles, page 601.
    Divine Protection and Provision in the Time of Trouble
  ' 6. What will the Lord be to His people in the time of trouble?
Ps. 27:5; Isa. 32:1, 2. Compare Psalm 91.
    7. While the wicked suffer intense hunger and thirst, what
divine provision will be made for the people of God? Joel 1:15-20;
Isa. 33:16; 41:17.
   NOTE.—"The people of God will not be free from suffering; but while per-
secuted and distressed, while they endure privation, and suffer for want of
food, they will not be left to perish. That God who cared for Elijah, will not
pass by one of His self-sacrificing children. He who numbers the hairs of their
head, will care for them; and in time of famine they shall be satisfied."—The
Great Controversy, page 629.
             Timely Counsel for the Trying Hour
    8. What earnest and affectionate invitation does the Lord send
to His people? Isa. 26:20, 21; Micah 4:10-12.
   NoTE.—In these and numerous other passages the Lord earnestly appeals to

21.

response to the agonizing cries of His people? Ps. 57:1, 2; Luke
18:7, 8.
                                    180 1
   NOTE.—"The people of God must drink of the cup, and be baptized with
the baptism. The very delay, so painful to them, is the best answer to 1.heir
petitions. As they endeavor to_wait trustingly for the Lord to work, they are
led to exercise faith, hope, and patience, which have been too little exercised
during their religious experience. Yet for the elect's sake, the time of trouble
will be shortened. . . . The end will come more quickly than men expect"—
The Great Controversy, pages 630, 631.
           The Glorious Hour of Triumph and Reward

marked difference will the wicked and righteous meet this glorious
event? Rev. 6:14-17; Isa. 25:8, 9.
   12. What company did John see on the sea of glass? Rev. 15:2,' 3.
   13. What most glorious privilege is given those who remain faith-
ful to God through the great tribulation? Rev. 7:13-17.
    NOTE.—"With the Lamb upon Mount Zion, 'having the harps of God,' they
stand, the hundred and forty and four thousand that were redeemed from
among men ; and there is heard, as the sound of many waters, and as the sound
of a great thunder, 'the voice of harpers harping with their harps.' And they
sing 'a new song' before the throne, a song which no man can learn save the
hundred and forty and four thousand. It is the song of Moses and the Lamb,
—a song of deliverance. None but the hundred and forty-four thousand can
learn that song; for it is the song of their experience,—an experience such as
no other company have ever had. . . . 'These are they which came out of
great tribulation;' they have passed through the time of trouble such as never
was since there was a nation; they have endured the anguish of the time of
Jacob's trouble; they have stood without an intercessor through the final out-
pouring of God's judgments. But they have been delivered."—The Great
Controversy, pages 648, 649.
   14. Who else are gathered before the throne of God? What will
they be doing? Verses 9-12.
   15. What heart longing of Jesus will be satisfied as He welcomes.
His people home? John 17:24; Matt. 25:34.
    NOTE.—"We may have a vision of the future, the blessedness of heaven.
In the Bible are revealed visions of future glory, scenes pictured by the hand
of God, and these are dear to His church. By faith we may stand on the
threshold of the eternal city, and hear the gracious welcome given to those
who in this life co-operate with Christ, regarding it as an honor to suffer for
His sake."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 601.

THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
                  March 31, 1945
             Inter-American Division




 THE  overflow of the Thirteenth Sabbath Offer-
  ing is to be devoted to the medical work. Two
 years ago the overflow for this division amounted to
 $19,937.01. Let us work for a much larger overflow
 on March 31, to help establish a sanitarium and hos-
 pital in this field.
