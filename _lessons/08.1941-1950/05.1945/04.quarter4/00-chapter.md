 EPISTLES TO THE THESSALONIANS AND PHILEMON


                    Lesson 1, for October 6, 1945
The Effectiveness of Paul's Ministry in Thessalonica
    MEMORY VERSE: "In every place your faith to Godward is spread abroad;
so that we need not to speak anything." 1 Thess. 1:8.
    STUDY HELP: "The Acts of the Apostles," pages 221-230. Read as an in-
troduction to the study of the Thessalonian Epistles.

                Paul Prays for the Thessalonians
   1. Who were associated with Paul at the time of writing the
First Epistle to the Thessalonians? In whom was the church in
Thessalonica said to be established? What salutation is given them?
1 Thess. 1:1.
    NoTE.—"Grace, . . . and peace" toward man express the attitude of God
and of Christ toward sinful man. In the announcement of the birth of
Jesus, this was revealed in the angel song: "On earth peace, good will toward
men." God is not angry with the sinner. Sin alone has provoked His wrath,
which will finally fall "upon the head of the wicked." Jer. 30:23, 24.
    "The arrival of Silas and Timothy from Macedonia, during Paul's sojourn
in Corinth, had greatly cheered the apostle. They brought him 'good tidings'
of the 'faith and charity' of those who had accepted the truth during the first
visit of the gospel messengers to Thessalonica. Paul's heart went out in tender
sympathy toward these believers, who, in the midst of trial and adversity,
had remained true to God. He longed to visit them in person, but as this
was not then possible, he wrote to them."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 255.
    2. What assurance is given of Paul's interest in the welfare of
the church at Thessalonica? 1 Thess. 1:2.
    3. What did the writer remember without ceasing? Verse 3.
    NorE.—The following comment on verse 3, is taken from Adam Clarke's
Commentary; "They had faith, not speculative and indolent, but true, sound,
and operative; their faith worked. They had love, . . . such a love as labored
with faith to fulfill the whole will of God. Faith worked; but love, because
it can do more, did more, and therefore labored—worked energetically, to
promote the glory of God and the salvation of men. They had hope; . . .
such a hope as produced a satisfying expectation of a future life and state of
blessedness, the reality of which faith had descried, and love anticipated; a
hope, not hasty and impatient to get out of the trials of life and possess the
heavenly inheritance, but one that was as willing to endure hardships as to
enjoy glory itself, when God might be most honored by this patient endur-
ance. Faith worked, love labored, and hope endured patiently."
                                      [ 31
    4. What did they know with certainty? 1 Thess. 1:4.
    NozE.—"No irrespective, unconditional, eternal, and personal election to
everlasting glory, is meant by the apostle. As God had chosen the Jews, whom,
because of their obstinate unbelief, He had now rejected; so He had now
chosen or elected the Gentiles. And in neither case was there anything ab-
solute; all was most specifically conditional, as far as their final salvation
was concerned; without any merit on their side, they were chosen and called
to those blessings which, if rightly used, would lead them to eternal glory."—
Adam Clarke, Commentary, Note on 1 Thess. 1:4.
                  The Gospel as Preached by Paul
     5. In what had the gospel come to them? Verse 5, first part.
     6. What made power and assurance possible in the apostles?
Verse 5, last part.
     7. Of whom did the Thessalonians become followers? Verse 6,
first part. See 1 Cor. 11:1.
    NOTE.—"Ye became followers of us, and of the Lord." In some instances
the work of an evangelist lives only so long as he is present to give inspiration
to the new believer. The convert has followed the evangelist, but failed to
follow him "in the Lord." In the Corinthian letter, Paul makes clear exactly
how far the convert can follow the human representative of his Lord. "Be
ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.' The moment human leader-
ship departs from the plain teaching of the word, it is unsafe leadership. It
is for this reason also that every disciple should exercise the greatest care in
his daily living lest the weak, because of his failure in the line of duty, be
turned from the divine Example and from the way of righteousness. Read
2 Cor. 4:1, 2.
    8. Under what conditions had the word come to them? 1 Thess.
1:6, last part.
                Examples to All the Believers
    9. To whom was the church in Thessalonica an example?
Verse 7.
  10. What particularly distinguished their Christian life and ex-
ample? Verse 8.
   NOTE.—"The Thessalonian believers were true missionaries. Their hearts
burned with zeal for their Saviour, who had delivered them from fear of
`the wrath to come.' Through the grace of Christ, a marvelous transformation
had taken place in their lives; and the word of the Lord, as spoken through
them, was accompanied with power. Hearts were won by the truths presented,
and souls were added to the number of believers."—The Acts of the Apostles,
page 256.
   11. What did the earnest service of the Thessalonian church
show? Verse 9, first part.
   12. To whom had they turned with all their hearts? Verse 9,
last part.
                                      [a]
                        Waiting in Expectation
   13. For whom were they expectantly waiting? 1 Thess. 1:10,
first part.
    NorE.—"As with holy boldness Paul proclaimed the gospel in the synagogue
at Thessalonica, a flood of light was thrown upon the true meaning of the
rites and ceremonies connected with the tabernacle service. He carried the
minds of his hearers beyond the earthly service and the ministry of Christ in
the heavenly sanctuary, to the time when, having completed His mediatorial
work, Christ would come again in power and great glory, and establish His
kingdom on the earth. Paul was a believer in the second coming of Christ;
so clearly and forcibly did he present the truths concerning this event, that
upon the minds of many who heard, there was made an impression which
never wore away."—The Acts of the Apostles, pages 228, 229.
   14. From what has Christ delivered His people? Verse 10, last
part.
    NoTE.—In his epistles to the churches which he had established during
his ministry, Paul constantly holds before them the grace and power of their
Saviour, Jesus Christ. Here again he reminds the Thessalonians that they
had been led from idolatry and degradation to the worship of the true and
living God; that they had received the gifts and graces of the Holy Spirit
and were now living happily in the assurance of sins forgiven and in anticipa-
tion of that eternal glory which had been promised to them through the
death and resurrection of Christ. With joy they were looking forward to life
with the Lord who had bought them. Their lives testified to the salvation
they had found in Jesus.


                   Lesson 2,   for October 13, 1945
                Examples of Kindly Ministry
   MEMORY VERSE: "That ye would walk worthy of God, who bath called you
unto His kingdom and glory." 1 Thess. 2:12.
   STUDY HELP: "Gospel Workers," pages 58-62.

              Paul's Company Comes to Thessalonica
    1. What did the Thessalonian brethren know concerning the
coming of Paul and his company into their community? 1 Thess. 2:1.
    2. Where had they been shamefully treated previous to their
arrival in Thessalonica? Verse 2, first part; Acts 16:22-40.
   Nora.—"Stirred by a frenzy of excitement, the multitude rose against the
disciples. A mob spirit prevailed, and was sanctioned by the authorities, who
tore the outer garments from the apostles, and commanded that they should
be scourged. .. . The apostles suffered extreme torture because of the painful
position in which they were left, but they did not murmur. Instead, in the
utter darkness and desolation of the dungeon, they encouraged each other by
words of prayer, and sang praises to God because they were found worthy to
suffer shame for His sake."—The Acts of the Apostles, pages 213, 214.
                                     [6 ]
     3. On arrival in Thessalonica, what did they immediately do?
1 Thess. 2:2, last part; Acts 17:1-10.
    NorE.—The word here translated, "contention" is from the same root as
our English word "agony," and here conveys the thought that the apostle
and his company were in constant peril of their lives as they made known
to the Thessalonians the gospel of God.
                    The Quality of Their Message
     4. What does Paul declare was not the nature of their message?
1 Thess. 2:3. Compare Acts 20:29, 30.
    NorE.—The apostle here affirms that they came to the Thessalonians under
no false pretense to allure them to a new way; their teaching had nothing
in it that could appeal to the earthly or sensual, as did the heathen religions
in which they had been reared; nor had they any sinister motives in the
background. Their exhortation had but one object: to turn men from evil
to good, from misery to happiness, and from the service of Satan to the
service of God.
     5. According to what commission did they speak? Whom did
they seek to please? Why? 1 Thess. 2:4.
     6. What instruction concerning faithfulness in proclaiming the
gospel did Paul give in his letter to Timothy? 2 Tim. 4:1-4.
    Nora.—"Ministers of God, with hearts aglow with love for Christ and
your fellow men, seek to arouse those who are dead in trespasses and sins.
Let your earnest entreaties and warnings pierce their consciences. Let your
fervent prayers melt their hearts, and lead them in penitence to the Saviour.
You are ambassadors for Christ, to proclaim His message of salvation. Re-
member that a lack of consecration and wisdom in you may turn the balance
for a soul, and send it to eternal death. You cannot afford to be careless
and indifferent. You need power, and this power God is willing to give you
without stint. He asks only a humble contrite heart, that is willing to believe
and receive His promises. You have only to use the means that God has
placed within your reach, and you will obtain the blessing."—Gospel Workers,
page 35.
      7. In their ministry, what wrong methods had they not used?
Who witnessed to the correctness of their behavior? 1 Thess. 2:5.
      8. What had they refrained from seeking? Verse 6. See margin.
    NorE.—"As we preached not for worldly gain, so we preached not for
popular applause; we had what we sought for—the approbation of God, and
the testimony of a good conscience."—Adam Clarke, Commentary.
                           First of All, Gentle
    9. With what does the apostle illustrate the spirit of their min-
istry? Verse 7.
   10. What instruction concerning the attitude of the minister
did Paul later give to Timothy? 2 Tim. 2:24, 25.
                                [6]
   NoTE.—"Courtesy is one of the graces of the Spirit. To deal with human
minds is the greatest work ever given to man ; and he who would find access to
hearts must heed the injunction, 'Be pitiful, be courteous.' Love will do that
which argument will fail to accomplish. But a moment's petulance, a single
gruff answer, a lack of Christian politeness and courtesy in some small matter,
may result in the loss of both friends and influence."—Gospel Workers,
page 121.
   11. How fully were Paul and his company willing to devote
themselves to giving the gospel to the Thessalonians? 1 Thess. 2:8.
    NoTE.—The words used here by the apostle are expressive of the strongest
affection and attachment. In giving the truths of the gospel of Jesus to them,
he was giving of his own heart. By laboring with his own hands to support
himself and his fellow workers, he was demonstrating that no selfish purpose or
thought controlled even his slightest action.
   12. What was the measure of their labors? What had they done
to avoid being a burden? Verse 9; Acts 20:34.
   13. How did they conduct themselves among those who believed?
1 Thess. 2:10.
    NoTE.—"What a consciousness of his own integrity must St. Paul have
had to use the expressions that are here No hypocrite, and none who did
the work of the Lord carelessly, could Make such an appeal both to God
and man."—Adam Clarke, Commentary.
   14. How had they dealt with the Thessalonian believers?
Verse 11.
    NOTE—In a previous statement (verse 7) Paul speaks of his relationship
to the church in Thessalonica as that of a nurse. We were "gentle among you."
Here, "as a father doth his children," he exhorts and comforts and charges
them. Such is the burden of responsibility which God places upon those whom
He has called to lead His people. With the tenderness and love of a nurse caring
for her own children, there is combined in the ministry of God's servants
the necessity for exhortation to faith and obedience; for strength to comfort
and encourage in the hour of trial and suffering; for admonition and witness
against wrongdoing in the life of the church and the individual. As a father,
Paul sought thus to measure up to his full responsibility as a minister of Christ.
   15. What was the end sought in all Paul's labors for the Thessa-
lonians? Verse 12.

                    Lesson 3, for October 20, 1945
                   Paul's Crown of Rejoicing
   MEMORY VERSE: "What is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are
not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at His corning?" 1 Thess. 2:19.
   STUDY HELP: "Gospel Workers," pages 512-519.
                            Cause for Gratitude
   1. In what state of continuous thankfulness did Paul say he was?
1 Thess. 2:13, first part.
                                [ 71
     2. What was a cause of Paul's continuous gratitude? What
does the word of God do in those who receive it gladly? 1 Thess.
2:13, last part.
    NoTE.—"The whole Bible is a manifestation of Christ, and the Saviour
desired to fix the faith of His followers on the word. When His visible pres-
ence should be withdrawn, the word must be their source of power. Like
their Master, they were to live 'by every word that proceedeth out of the
mouth of God.' As our physical life is sustained by food, so our spiritual
life is sustained by the word of God. And every soul is to receive life from
God's word for himself. As we must eat for ourselves in order to receive
nourishment, so we must receive the word for ourselves. We are not to
obtain it merely through the medium of another's mind. We should carefully
study the Bible, asking God for the aid of the Holy Spirit, that we may under-
stand His word."—The Desire of Ages, page 390.
     3. What change in the life is effected by the word of God?
1 Peter 1:23; Heb. 4:12.
    NorE.—"The word of God is the seed. Every seed has in itself a germinat-
ing principle. In it the life of the plant is enfolded. So there is life in God's
word. Christ says, 'The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they
are life.' He that heareth My word, and believeth on Him that sent Me, hath
everlasting life' In every command and in every promise of the word of God
is the power, the very life of God, by which the command may be fulfilled and
the promise realized. He who by faith receives the word is receiving the very
life and character of God."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 38.

                   Conflict With Unbelieving Jews
   4. Of whom had the Thessalonian brethren become followers?
1 Thess. 2:14, first part.
     5. What had they in common with the churches in Judea? Verse
14, last part.
    NorE.—From Adam Clarke's Commentary, we give this comment on the
latter part of verse 14: "It is worthy of remark that, in almost every case,
the Jews were the leaders of all persecutions against the apostles and the
infant church. And what they could not do themselves, they instigated others
to do; and, by gathering together lewd fellows of the baser sort from among
the Gentiles, they made frequent uproars, and especially at Thessalonica,
where the opposition to the gospel was very high, and the persecution of the
Christians very hot."
     6. What had the Jews done against God and against Paul?
Whom were they displeasing? With how many were they in con-
flict? Verse 15.
    Nori.—The guilt that the Jews incurred by putting to death the Son of
God, saying, "His blood be on us," needs more than a passing thought. This
crime heads the list of all the sins charged against them.
    7. What had the Jews forbidden the disciples to do? With what
result to themselves? Verse 16.
                                      [87
   8. How does Paul express his great desire to visit the Thessa-
lonian brethren personally? 1 Thess. 2:17.
                 The Apostle's Hope and Joy
    9. Why had he been unable to do this? Verse 18.
   NoTE.—Paul had already sent Timothy and Silas to Thessalonica, but he
earnestly desired to go in person. There was, however, such a storm of perse-
cution raised up against him that his friends did not think it expedient or
prudent for him to go, lest he endanger his life.
  10. What question does the apostle now ask? Verse 19, first part.
  11. How does he answer his own question? Verse 19, last part.
    NorE.—In this verse, Paul both asks and answers a question that often
arises in the minds of earnest, persevering servants of the Lord. To both min-
istry and laity, the service of Christ frequently brings disappointments in
that some who enter upon the way, depart therefrom, and thus impose heart-
aches and deep sorrow upon those who have won them to Christ. But there
are many others, as the church at Thessalonica, who are loyal, steadfast
followers of the Master. These are the hope and the joy of the faithful worker
for Christ. The apostle asks the question to emphasize his answer. He adds
"in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at His coming" to emphasize that
his greatest joy will come when he sees them triumphant and victorious at
Christ's appearing and kingdom.
  12. In what similar words does the apostle John speak of his af-
fection for his spiritual children? 3 John 3, 4.
  13. How does Paul again state the relation of the believers to
him? 1 Thess. 2:20.
   NorE.—"Every impulse of the Holy Spirit leading men to goodness and
to God, is noted in the books of heaven, and in the day of God everyone who
has given himself as an instrument for the Holy Spirit's working, will be per-
mitted to behold what his life has wrought."—Gospel Workers, pages 517, 518.
  14. What promise of like joy is given to every wholehearted
worker for Christ? Ps. 126:5, 6.


                    Lesson 4, for October 27, 1945
               To Strengthen and to Comfort
   MEMORY VERSE: "Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all
our affliction and distress by your faith: for now we live, if ye stand fast in the
Lord." 1 Thess. 3:7, 8.
   STUDY HELP: "The Acts of the Apostles," pages 255-257; 57 5-577.

              Paul Sends Timothy to Thessalonica
    1. Though hindered from visiting Thessalonica, what unselfish
decision did Paul make? 1 Thess. 3:1.
                               [9
    2. Whom did he send to them? What does he call him? 1 Thess.
3:2, first part.
    3. For what purpose had Timothy been sent to them? Verse 2,
last part.
    Nom—The preferred reading for "to comfort," is "to exhort," "to en-
courage." The apostle's intent was for Timothy to bring to the church mem-
bers in Thessalonica a fuller knowledge of the gospel than was possible for
Paul and his company to give them in the short period of their first visit,
when, because of persecution, they had been compelled to leave Thessalonica
hastily. Thus he sought to instruct them and strengthen them for the con-
flict which he knew the bitter enemies of the faith would continue to bring
upon them.
                  Christians in Tribulation
   4. In writing to Timothy, what general statement does Paul
make concerning tribulation? 2 Tim. 3:12.
    NOTE.—"Persecution in its varied forms is the development of a principle
which will exist as long'as Satan exists and Christianity has vital power. No
man can serve God without enlisting against himself the opposition of the
hosts of darkness. Evil angels will assail him, alarmed that his influence is
taking the grey from their hands. Evil men, rebuked by his example, will
unite with them in seeking to separate him from God by alluring temptations.
When these do not succeed, then a compelling power is employed to force
the conscience."—The Great Controversy, page 610.
    5. In face of affliction, how should every man stand? Why?
1 Thess. 3:3.
    6. What had Paul previously told the Thessalonian brethren?
Verse 4.
    7. How did he restate his purpose in sending Timothy to them?
Verse 5.
                            Paul Reassured
    8. What report did Timothy bring to Paul? What desire does
he again express? Verse 6.
    9. How did this report affect the apostle? How did he express
the intensity of his desire for them? Verses 7, 8.
   NorE.—His own tribulations sink into insignificance as he hears through
Timothy of the persevering faith of his beloved children. He exclaims:
"Now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord." Their steadfastness had given
him new life. He felt that he had labored to some real purpose and had not
labored in vain.
                      Rejoicing in God
  10. What question does he ask? For what was he diligently
praying? Verses 9;10.
  11. Upon whom does he rely for the fulfillment of his desire?
Verse 11.
                            [ 10]
   NOTE.—Paul here expresses a thought that should dominate every plan
and purpose of the servant of God. With great longing he desired to be able
to meet again with the church at Thessalonica. Yet he exclaims: "God Him-
self and our Father, . . . direct our way unto you." He dared not make the
decision merely by consulting his own inclinations, although he prayed and
hoped that it might be God's will to so arrange. As a matter of history, it
was some five or six years later that Paul revisited Thessalonica. He was
God's servant, under God's orders, subject wholly to His direction, as should
be every servant of Jesus.

                The End for Which We Strive
  12. What desire did Paul express on behalf of his Thessalonian
brethren? 1 Thess. 3:12.
  13. What was the object of the abounding love he desired in their
behalf? Verse 13, first part.
   NOTE.—"Unblamable in holiness." Paul's wish for the believers to increase
and abound in love toward each other and toward all mankind had an ob-
jective—the establishment of their hearts "unblamable in holiness" before
God the Father. Only as the love of God permeates and controls the life
can holiness be. developed. He who has the love of God in his heart becomes
a partaker of the divine nature.
  14. Before whom and when will this condition of holiness be
established? Verse 13, last part.
    NoTE.—If God's love is an abiding presence in the life, it will be known
to all about us by our holy life and conversation. The day will come when
we must appear before the "Judge of all the earth." Will that which appears
to be unblamable and holy to our fellow men stand the searching scrutiny of
God? This is a question every Christian should frequently ask himself.



                   Lesson 5, for November 3, 1945
                    Growing Up Into Christ
   MEMORY VERSE: "This is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye
should abstain from fornication." 1 Thess. 4:3.
   STUDY HELP: "Growing Up Into Christ," chapter 8, "Steps to Christ."

                    Steady Growth Required
    1. What specific exhortation does the apostle give to the Thessa-
lonian church? 1 Thess. 4:1.
   NOTE.—"As your soul yearns after God, you will find more and still more
of the unsearchable riches of His grace. As you contemplate these riches,
you will come into possession of them, and will reveal the merits of the Sav-
iour's sacrifice, the protection of His righteousness, the fullness of His wisdom,
and His power to present you before the Father 'without spot, and blame-
less.' "—The Acts of the Apostles, page 567.
     2. To what former experience does Paul appeal? 1 Thess. 4:2.

                   God's Will—Our Sanctification
     3. What is God's will for His children? Verse 3, first part.
    NorE.—"True sanctification is an entire conformity to the will of God."—
Mrs. E. G. White, The Sanctified Life, page 8.
   "As in nature, so in grace; there can be no life without growth. The plant
must either grow or die. As its growth is silent and imperceptible, but con-
tinuous, so is the development of the Christian life. At every stage of devel-
opment our life may be perfect; yet if God's purpose for us is fulfilled, there
will be continual advancement. Sanctification is the work of a lifetime."—
Christ's Object Lessons, page 65.
    4. What is specifically mentioned as being included in the will
of God? Verses 3-5.
    NoTE.—In the days of Paul the heathen world was without moral stand-
ards such as are taught in the word of God. The early churches were to some
extent influenced by their surroundings the same as today the spirit of un-
belief, love of pleasure, and certain loose standards of morality have invaded,
in some cases, the lives of the professed children of God. Paul was writing
definite warnings to the Thessalonian brethren that these conditions must
not obtain in the churches of Christ. Read The Acts of the Apostles, pages
299, 300.
   5. What must be the relation of brother to brother? Who would
avenge the wronged? Verse 6.

                           Walking Honestly
   6. Unto what has God not called us? To what has He called
His children? Verse 7.
     7. What does the apostle say of those who reject this instruction?
What has God done for His true servants? Verse 8.
    NorE.—He who fails to accept the robe of Christ's righteousness, places
himself on dangerous ground. In Christ's Object Lessons, pages 318, 319
(new edition, pages 324, 325), we read: "Sad will be the retrospect in that
day when men stand face to face with eternity. The whole life will present
itself just as it has been. The world's pleasures, riches, and honors will not
then seem so important. Men will then see that the righteousness they de-
spised is alone of value. They will see that they have fashioned their char-
acters under the deceptive allurements of Satan. The garments they have
chosen are the badge of their allegiance to the first great apostate. Then they
will see the results of their choice. They will have a knowledge of what
it means to transgress the commandments of God."
     8. Of what had the Thessalonians no need that Paul write to
them? What had God taught them? Verse 9.
                                    [ 12 1
    9. What proof had they given of their love? For what did Paul
plead? 1 Thess. 4:10.
   10. What three things were they to study? Verse 11.
   NoTE.—"Though in general the church at Thessalonica was pure and ex-
emplary, yet there seem to have been some idle, tattling people among them,
who disturbed the peace of others; persons who, under the pretense of religion,
gadded about from house to house; did not work, but were burdensome to
others; and were continually meddling with other people's business, making
parties, and procuring their bread by religious gossiping. To these the apostle
gives those directions which the whole church of God should enforce wherever
such troublesome and dangerous •people are found; viz.: That they should
study to be quiet, to hold their peace, as their religious cant will never pro-
mote true religion; that they should do their own business, and let that of
others alone; and that they should work with their own hands, and not be a
burden to the church of God, or to those well-meaning but weak and incon-
siderate people who entertain them, being imposed on by their apparent
sanctity and glozing conversation. An idle person, though able to discourse
like an angel, or pray like an apostle, cannot be a Christian; all such are
hypocrites and deceivers; the true members of the church of Christ walk, work,
and labor."—Adam Clarke, Commentary.
   11. In living such a life of quiet service, what would be their
relation to those without? Verse 12.
   NoTE.—The Syriac translation of "that ye may have lack of nothing"
reads as follows: "That ye be dependent upon no man."
   "That ye may be able to get your bread by honest labor, which God will
ever bless; and be chargeable to no man. He that is dependent on another is
necessarily in bondage; and he who is able to get his own bread by the sweat
of his brow, should not be under obligation even to a king."—Adam Clarke,
Commentary.


                  Lesson 6, for November 10, 1945
                         The Blessed Hope
   MEMORY VERSE: "If we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so
them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with Him." 1 These. 4:14.
   STUDY HELP: "The Acts of the Apostles," pages 257-259.

                      Thy Dead Shall Live
   1. Of what did the apostle Paul desire that the Thessalonians
should not be in ignorance? 1 Thess. 4:13, first part.
   NoTE.—"The Thessalonians had eagerly grasped the idea that Christ was
coming to change the faithful who were alive, and to take them to Himself.
They had carefully guarded the lives of their friends, lest they should die,
and lose the blessing which they looked forward to receiving at the coming
of their Lord. But one after another their loved ones had been taken from
them; and with anguish the Thessalonians had looked for the last time upon
                                     [ 18 j
the faces of their dead, hardly daring to hope to meet them in a future life."—
The Acts of the Apostles, page 258.
      2. What does he indicate is the condition of those who are igno-
rant of God's plans for His children who sleep in death? 1 Thess.
4:13, last part.
     NoTE.—How different is the attitude of those who have faith in God as
contrasted with those who have no hope! The former see their loved ones
laid away in the full knowledge that they will meet again in the home of the
redeemed, while with those who have no hope, death is a final parting, and
there is nothing to which they may hopefully look forward. The child of
hope, in full acceptance of God's promises, looks forward to companionship
with the resurrected righteous through the eternal years. To those who sleep,
the next moment will be the awaking to the promise of endless life and
companionship with God and Christ and the multitude of the saved.
      3. In Isaiah's day, what promise was made concerning the dead?
Isa. 26:19.
    NorE.—Isaiah's prophecy had a partial fulfillment in the resurrection
which took place when Christ died on the cross of Calvary. Matt. 27:51-53.
"Those who were called from their graves went into the city, and appeared
unto many in their resurrected forms, and testified that Jesus had indeed
risen from the dead, and that they had risen with Him. The voice that cried,
`It is finished,' was heard among the dead. It pierced the walls of sepulchers,
and summoned the sleepers to arise. Thus shall it be when God's voice shall
be heard shaking the heavens and earth."—Mrs. E. G. White, Spirit of Proph-
ecy, vol. 3, p. 223.
      4. How was this same hope and confidence expressed by Job?
Job 14:14, 15.
      5. On what does the apostle base his hope of the resurrection
of the dead? 1 Thess. 4:14, first part.
     6. What conclusion does he draw from his faith in Christ's
death and resurrection? Verse 14, last part.
    NorE.—"The Bible clearly teaches that the dead do not go immediately
to heaven. They are represented as sleeping until the resurrection. In the
very day when the silver cord is loosed and the golden bowl broken, man's
thoughts perish. They that go down to the grave are in silence. They know
no more of anything that is done under the sun. Blessed rest for the weary
righteous! Time, be it long or short, is but a moment to them. They sleep ;
they are awakened by the trump of God to a glorious immortality. . . . As
they are called forth from their deep slumber, they begin to think just where
they ceased. The last sensation was the pang of death, the last thought that
they were falling beneath the power of the grave. When they arise from the
tomb, their first glad thought will be echoed in the triumphal shout, '0 death,
where is thy sting? 0 grave, where is thy victory?' "—The Great Controversy,
page 550.
                    The Lord Himself Will Come
    7. By whose instruction was Paul speaking? Verse 15, first part.
                              [ 14 ]
   8. What statement does he make concerning our relation in that
day to those who are raised from the dead? 1 Thess. 4:15, last part.
    NOTE.—The word "prevent" in the text has the meaning of preceding, or
going before. See Strong's Concordance, Greek Dictionary Section, page 75.
    "Paul showed that those living when Christ should come would not go to
meet their Lord in advance of those who had fallen asleep in Jesus. The voice
of the Archangel and the trump of God would reach the sleeping ones, and
the dead in Christ should rise first, before the touch of immortality should
be given to the living."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 258.
    9. What is asserted as to the Lord's part in the raising of the
dead? Who would be first to rise? Verse 16.
   10. In what beautiful words did the apostle speak to the Corin-
thian church concerning this same hope? 1 Cor. 15:15-22, 51, 52.
   11. What follows immediately after the resurrection of the
righteous dead? 1 Thess. 4:17, first part.
   12. For how long will the resurrected and the living remain with
their Lord? Verse 17, last clause; Rev. 21:3.
                    Exhortation and Comfort
   13. With what exhortation does the apostle close this chapter?
1 Thess. 4:18.
    NOTE.—Each chapter of the first Thessalonian epistle thus far has closed
with a direct reference to the hope of Christ's second appearing. It appears
in the dosing verses of chapter one, in the 19th and 20th verses of chapter two,
and in verse 13 of chapter three. The fourth chapter devotes six full verses to
the subject of the resurrection as connected with the second coming and the
gathering of the saints.
  14. In Paul's letter to Titus, how does he refer to the second
coming of Jesus? Titus 2:13.


                  Lesson 7, for November 17, 1945
               Peace and Safety; Faithfulness
   MEMORY VERSE: "Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us
watch and be sober." 1 Then. 5:6.
   STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," chapter 69, or pages 627-636.
                 A Harbinger of Destruction
   1. Of what had Paul no need to write unto the Thessalonians?
1 Thess. 5:1.
   2. What did they know perfectly concerning the coming of the
Lord? Verse 2; Rom. 13:11, 12.
                                     [ 15
    3. What would many be saying in that day? With what result
to themselves? 1 Thess. 5:3.
    NOTE.—"The judgments of God are soon to be poured out upon the earth.
`Escape for thy life,' is the warning from the angels of -God. Other voices are
heard saying, 'Do not become excited; there is no cause for special
alarm.' Those who are at ease in Zion cry peace and safety, while heaven
declares that swift destruction is about to come upon the transgressor. The
young, the frivolous, the pleasure loving, consider these warnings as idle
tales, and turn from them with a jest. Parents are inclined to think their
children about right in the matter, and all sleep on at ease. Thus it was at
the destruction of the old world, and when Sodom and Gomorrah were con-
sumed by fire. On the night prior to their destruction, the cities of the plain
rioted in pleasure. Lot was derided for his fears and warnings. But it was
these scoffers that perished in the flames. That very night the door of mercy
was forever closed to the wicked, careless inhabitants of Sodom."—Testi-
monies, vol. 5, pp. 233, 234.
    Read Christ's Object Lessons, pages 411-413 (new edition, pages 419-422),
for further comment on this subject.
    4. How does the apostle again emphasize the awareness of the
children of the kingdom? Verse 4.
   5. What are they said to be? To what do they not belong?
Verse 5.                                      •
    NoTE.—The children of God do not know either the day or the hour of
Christ's return. But He has not left us in darkness as to "the times and the
seasons." He has made clear by unmistakable signs when His coming will
be near, "even at the doors." Those who keep close to God and to His
revealed word will be "children of light, and the children of the day."
    "We have reached the period foretold in these scriptures. The time of
the end is come, the visions of the prophets are unsealed, and their solemn
warnings point us to our Lord's coming in glory as near at hand."—The De-
sire of Ages, page 234.
                     Admonitions to Watchfulness
    6. In what important respect is the church to be different from
the world? Verse 6.
    7. What is the common practice of the indifferent and the care-
less? Verse 7.
    8. What preparation will the church be making? Verse 8. See
Eph. 5:13-16.
   NOTE.—"What the breastplate and helmet are to the soldier's heart and
head, such are faith, love, and hope to us. Faith enables us to endure, as
seeing Him who is invisible; love excites us to diligence and activity, and
makes us bear our troubles and difficulties pleasantly; hope helps us to antici-
pate the great end, the glory that shall be revealed, and which we know we
shall in due time obtain, if we faint not."—Adam Clarke, Commentary, note
on 1 Thess. 5:8.
                                      [ 16 ]
    9. To what has God appointed His children? 1 Thess. 5:9.
   10. What has Christ done, that life with Him might be possible
to all? Verse 10.
   NorE.—The apostle seeks to bring home to the church the truth that
wherever the Christian is, he is safe with Christ, and that the hour is ap-
proaching when he will live together with his Lord. Even now, amid earth's
turmoil, strife, and suffering, it is possible for the follower of Christ to
have peace in the heart. Ahead is the better land where God and Christ
shall dwell forever with the redeemed.
  11. Because of this hope, what were all to do? Verse 11.
                  Esteem for Leadership
  12. How was the church admonished to regard its leaders?
Verse 12.
   NoTE.—"The Thessalonian believers were greatly annoyed by men coming
among them with fanatical ideas and doctrines. Some were 'disorderly, work-
ing not at all, but .. . busybodies✓The church had been properly organized,
and officers had been appointed to act as ministers and deacons. But there
were some, self-willed and impetuous, who refused to be subordinate to those
who held positions of authority in the church. They claimed not only the
right of private judgment, but that of publicly urging their views upon the
church. In view of this, Paul called the attention of the Thessalonians to
the respect and' deference due to those who had been chosen to occupy posi-
tions of authority in the church."—The Acts of the Apostles, pages 261, 262.
  13. How and for what were they to hold these leaders in esteem?
Verse 13, first part.
    NOTE.—"Christian ministers, who preach the whole truth, and labor in
the word and doctrine, are entitled to more than respect; the apostle com-
mands them to be esteemed, abundantly, and superabundantly; and this is
to be done in love."—Adam Clarke, Commentary.
  14. What condition was to be maintained among the members?
Verse 13, last part.

                  Lesson 8, for November 24, 1945
                 Preparing to Meet the Lord
   MEMORY VERSE: "The very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray
God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of
our Lord Jesus Christ." 1 Thess. 5:23.
   STUDY HELP: "The Acts of the Apostles," pages 263, 264.

                  An Exhortation to Godliness .
    1. How did the apostle point out the duty of the church toward
various elements in their midst? 1 Thess. 5:14.
                                       17
     2. What attitude should the Christian take when ill-treated?
Among how many should this spirit be shown? 1 Thess. 5:15.
    NOTE.—Said Christ: "Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an
eye, and a tooth for a tooth: but I say unto you, That ye resist not evil."
Matt. 5:38, 39. See also Exodus 21:23-25. So, too, the apostle sought not only
to preach the principles of the kingdom of Christ, but to live them. His ex-
periences through suffering in Jerusalem, in Asia Minor, in Macedonia, in
Greece, and in Rome brought out no spirit of retaliation. As he had seen
Stephen stoned and heard his triumphant cry, "Lord, lay not this sin to their
charge," he had learned the spirit of the Lord, and in his afterlife be sought
to exemplify it.
    3. What state of heart will characterize the Christian at all
times? 1 Thess. 5:16; Matt. 5:12
    NorE.—The established Christian is ever joyful. He rejoices even in
tribulation, happy that he can suffer with his Lord.
     4. In what exercise will he engage without ceasing? 1 Thess.
5:17.
    NOTE.—"It is in the mount with God—the secret place of communion—
that we are to contemplate His glorious ideal for humanity. . . . While en-
gaged in our daily work, we should lift the soul to heaven in prayer. These
silent petitions rise like incense before the throne of grace; and the enemy
is baffled. The Christian whose heart is thus stayed upon God cannot be
overcome. No evil arts can destroy his peace. All the promises of God's word,
all the power of divine grace, all the resources of Jehovah, are pledged to
secure his deliverance."
    "Ask, then; ask, and ye shall receive. Ask for humility, wisdom, courage,
increase of faith. To every sincere prayer an answer will come."—Gospel
Workers, pages 254, 258.
   5. In every situation, what should the Christian do? Why?
Verse 18.
                     The Holy Spirit Must Work
     6. What brief admonition concerning the Holy Spirit does the
apostle give? Verse 19; Eph. 4:30.
    NOTE.—"The Spirit was to be given as a regenerating agent, and without
this the sacrifice of Christ would have been of no avail. . . . Sin could be re-
sisted and overcome only through the mighty agency of the Third Person
of the Godhead, who would come with no modified energy, but in the full-
ness of divine power. It is the Spirit that makes effectual what has been
wrought out by the world's Redeemer. It is by the Spirit that the heart is
made pure. Through the Spirit the believer becomes a partaker of the divine
nature. Christ has given His Spirit as a divine power to overcome all hereditary
and cultivated tendencies to evil, and to impress His own character upon His
church."—The Desire of Ages, page 671.
    "The Spirit works upon man's heart, according to his desire and consent
implanting in him a new nature."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 411.
                                     [18 ]
    "The heart that does not respond to divine agencies becomes hardened
until it is no longer susceptible to the influence of the Holy Spirit. Then it
is that the word is spoken, 'Cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?' "—
Ibid., page 218.
      7. What manifestation of the Spirit is not to be despised?
1 Thess. 5:20.
    NOTE.—The gift of prophecy comes not only to foretell future events, but
also to interpret and make clear those things which are occurring about us,
and to prepare the church and the individual to meet the fiery trials of their
day. To no church since apostolic times has God given a clearer revelation
of His will than to the remnant church, "which keep- the commandments
of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ." Rev. 12:17. And "the testi-
mony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy." Rev. 19:10. Richly blessed with
the prophetic gift, let the church today receive it and "despise not prophesy-
ings."
      8. How are we to recognize and regard the good? 1 Thess. 5:21.
     NoTE.—It is evident that the apostle is still speaking of "prophesyings."
Our Lord has told us that in these last days "there shall arise -false christs,
and false prophets." Matt. 24:24. Tragic as it might be to be deceived by one
of these, it may be equally tragic to turn away from the messages that God
sends through His chosen messengers. Any claimant to the prophetic gift
is to be tested or proved. He is to be accepted only if his teachings are in
harmony with the word of God and His sacred law, if they magnify Jesus
as the world's Redeemer and tend to build up His church. The same Greek
word translated in 1 Thessalonians 5:21 as "hold fast," is found in Revela-
tiOn 12:17, where, speaking of the remnant church, it is said that they "have
the testimony of Jesus," which, in Revelation 19:10, is called "the spirit of
prophecy."
      9. From what should every Christian disciple abstain? 1 Thess.
5:22.
     NOTE.—We are to avoid even the appearance of sin. God would have
 every word, every act of life, acceptable to Him and above reproach in the
 sight of men. It should be said of the church as of old time concerning Dan-
 iel: "We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it
 against him concerning the law of his God." Dan. 6:5.

                     Final Prayer and Admonition
  10. For what did the apostle pray in behalf of the Thessalonians?
1 Thess. 5:23.
   11. Of what does he assure them? Verse 24.
   12. What would he have them do for him? Verse 25.
   13. What custom of the time were they to follow among them-
selves? Verse 26.
    NorE.—In the Coptic, "greet all the brethren" is rendered, "greet one
another." This would appear more in harmony with the instruction given
elsewhere in Paul's epistles.
                                     [ 19 ]
    "The men and women [in the early church] were placed in separate parts
of the building where they met for worship ; and then, before receiving the
holy communion, the men kissed the men, and the women the women."—
Conybeare and Howson, The Life and Epistles of the Apostle Paul, note,
page 326.
  14. What charge does the apostle give? What final salutation?
1 Thess. 5:27, 28.


                    Lesson 9, for December 1, 1945 .
                         Resting With Christ
   MEMORY VERSE: "Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God
would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfill all the good pleasure of His good-
ness, and the work of faith with power." 2 Thess. 1:11.
   STUDY HELP: "The Acts of the Apostles," pages 264-266.

                          The Salutation
    1. With what greeting does the Second Epistle to the Thessa-
lonians open? 2 Thess. 1:1, 2.
    2. How did Paul customarily address the brethren in the
churches to whom he wrote? Rom. 1:1, 7; 1 Cor. 1:1, 2.
    Nom—Paul addressed the churches in Christ with a clear claim to
apostleship, a deep and unfeigned love for all the brethren, a definite and
abiding confidence in the working of God's Spirit in their hearts, and a prayer
expressing gratitude for what Christ had done for them and would do as His
grace was bestowed upon the church in preparation for service. It was "Paul,
called to be an apostle," "Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ," "Paul, a prisoner."
"Grace be unto you," "Grace, mercy, and peace," are frequent salutations of
desire expressed for their temporal and spiritual welfare. The apostle wrote
with an apparent familiarity with their lives in Christ, and a consuming desire
for their welfare that demonstrated his love for all his children in Christ and
his all-consuming longing for them to find Christ in His fullness.

                   God's Righteous judgment
    3. What does the apostle say is proper for him to do in behalf
of the Thessalonians? 2 Thess. 1:3, first part.
    4. What Christian grace had grown in them? What other grace
abounded in all? Verse 3, last part.
    5. How were their patience and faith made manifest? Verse 4.
    6. Of what was their patient suffering a manifest token? Of
what would they be counted worthy? Verse 5.
    NorE.—Paul "expressed his confidence in their [the Thessalonian church)
integrity, and his gratitude that their faith was strong, and that their love
                                         20 ]
abounded for one another, and for the cause of their Master. He told them
that he presented them to other churches as an example of the patient, per-
severing faith that bravely withstands persecution and tribulation; and he
carried their minds forward to the time of the second coming of Christ, when
the people of God shall rest from all their cares and perplexities."—The Acts
of the Apostles, page 264.
   7. What recompense would God give to those who troubled the
church? 2 Thess. 1:6.
   Nom—Those who bring persecution upon the people of God must face
the certainty of that tribulation which God will surely bring upon an unre-
pentant world. Christ said: "Shall not God avenge His own elect, which cry
day and night unto Him, though He bear long with them? I tell you that He
will avenge them speedily." Luke 18:7, 8. None can oppress or persecute
God's own without suffering the penalty of His oppressions. How carefully
then ought every member of the church to pattern his life after the love and
mercy shown by the Master.
                      God's Power Manifested
    8. To what event is the troubled child of God to look for de-
liverance? 2 Thess. 1:7.
    9. On what two classes of God's enemies will He then take
vengeance? Verse 8.
   10. What will be the form of their punishment? Verse 9.
   11. In whom will Christ then be glorified? In whom admired?
Verse 10.
                      Desire and Commendation
   12. Of what did Paul pray that they might be counted worthy?
Verse 11, first part.
   13. What did he desire to see fulfilled to them? Verse 11, last part.
    NOTE.—God counts him worthy of being called in Christ who shows a
willing submission of his life to the molding influences of the Holy Spirit.
When Christ comes and dwells in the heart by faith, controlling, guiding,
influencing every word and act, this is the beginning of the life eternal. When
His Holy Word is our daily food, when its influence makes evident that we
practice its principles, we are even now eating of the leaves of the tree of life.
The "bread of life" as become a reality. We no longer "live by bread alone,
but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God."
  14. What did he desire for them in Jesus? According to what?
Verse 12.

                  Lesson 10, for December 8, 1945
                   The Mystery of Iniquity
   MEMORY VERSE: "The mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who
now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way." 2 Thess. 2 :7.
   STUDY HELP: "The Great Controversy," pages 355, 356, 443, 444, 49-60
(new edition, pages 407, 408, 506, 507, 55-67).

                          Words of Warning
       1. By what does the apostle beseech the church of God? 2 Thess.
2:1.
   2. Concerning what particular hope does he warn against de-
ception? Verse 2.
    NOTE.—"When the Thessalonian Church received erroneous views con-
cerning the coming of Christ, the apostle Paul counseled them to test their
hopes and anticipations carefully by the word of God. He -cited them to
prophecies revealing the events to take place before Christ should come, and
showed that they had no ground to expect Him in their day. 'Let no man
deceive you by any means,' are his words of warning. Should they indulge
expectations that were not sanctioned by the Scriptures, they would be led
to a mistaken course of action; disappointment would expose them to the
derision of unbelievers, and they would be in danger of yielding to discour-
agement, and would be tempted to doubt the truths essential for their salva-
tion. The apostle's admonition to the Thessalonians contains an important
lesson for those who live in the last days. Many Adventists have felt that un-
less they could fix their faith upon a definite time for the Lord's coming,
they could not be zealous and diligent in the work of preparation. But as
their hopes are again and again excited, only to be destroyed, their faith
receives such a shock that it becomes well-nigh impossible for them to be
impressed by the great truths of prophecy."—The Great Controversy, pages
456, 457.
                             The Man of Sin
    3. Before the day of Christ's coming, what must take place?
Verse 3, first part.
    4. Who would be revealed before Christ's appearing? Verse 3,
last part.
    5. What would the man of sin do? Whose place would he at-
tempt to usurp? Verse 4.
    NorE.—"The apostle Paul warned the church not to look for the coming
of Christ in his day. 'That day shall not come,' he says, 'except there come a
falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed.' Not till after the great
apostasy, and the long period of the reign of the 'man of sin,' can we look for
the advent of our Lord. The 'man of sin,' which is also styled the 'mystery of
iniquity,' the 'son of perdition,' and 'that wicked,' represents the papacy,
which, as foretold in prophecy, was to maintain its supremacy for 1260 years.
This period ended in 1798. The coming of Christ could not take place before
                                     ( 22 ]
that time. Paul covers with his caution the whole of the Christian dispensa-
tion down to the year 1798. It is this side of that time that the message of
Christ's second coming is to be proclaimed."—The Great Controversy,
page 356.
    6. What had Paul told the Thessalonians while he was yet
with them? 2 Thess. 2:5.
    7. As a result of Paul's oral instruction, what did the members
of the Thessalonian church know? Verse 6.
    Nora.—Without a doubt, the apostle's oral instruction regarding the future
events referred to had been based upon the prophecies of Daniel. The
"man of sin," says Paul, should be revealed "in his time." He assured them
that there was a restraining power that would hold in check the forces of
evil, that they should not accomplish their ends prematurely. The time for
the rise of this power had been clearly set forth by the prophet Daniel. Not
until that world empire should be divided into ten kingdoms, and not until
three of these had been removed before it, could that power represented
by the little horn of Daniel 7:24, be seated upon the throne of universal
civil and religious rule. The Christians of the early centuries knew of these
prophecies, and they used to pray for the continuance of the Roman Empire,
because they dreaded the appearance of the antichrist, who would arise after
its division.
    It is also true that behind the external power of civil governments there
is ever the divine power that restrains the working of the forces of evil. And
there were the restraining influences of the word of God and of His Spirit that
held back the development of the "falling away" or the apostasy in the
church. Not until the time should come when, by resisting the Holy Spirit
and setting aside the word of God, His own church would refuse to be guided
by Him, could the apostate power so exalt itself as to sit in the seat of God. •
    8. How does the apostle more specifically portray the restraint
of the workings of the enemy until the appointed time? What would
eventually be done to this hindering power? 2 Thess. 2:7.
   9. With the removal of the restraining power, who should be
revealed? What should be done with him? Verse 8.
   NorE.—This verse clearly introduces the portrayal of final events that
take place in dose connection with the second coming of Christ. After pro-
bation has closed, "when the restraining Spirit of God shall be wholly with-
drawn from the wicked, no longer to hold in check the outburst of human
passion and satanic wrath," the inhabitants of earth will see "as never before,
the results of Satan's rule."—The Great Controversy, page 37.
   "As the crowning act in the great drama of deception, Satan himself will
personate Christ. . . . In different parts of the earth, Satan will manifest
himself among men as a majestic being of dazzling brightness, resembling
the description of the Son of God given by John in the Revelation. The
glory that surrounds him is unsurpassed by anything that mortal eyes have
yet beheld. The shout of triumph rings out upon the air, 'Christ has come!
Christ has come!' . . . Only those who have been diligent students of the
Scriptures, and who have received the love of the truth, will be shielded
                                      23
from" the powerful delusion that takes the world captive."—The Great Con-
troversy, pages 624, 625. (Study context.)
  10. What is further said of the unprecedented deceptive working
of the forces of evil led by Satan at this time? 2 Thess. 2:9.
   11. Who would be especially deceived by Satan's signs and won-
ders? Verse 10, first part.
   12. Why had these individuals been easy prey to the deceptions
of Satan? Verse 10, last part.
    NoTE.—The apostle in the latter part of verse 10 states a truth that is
vital to Christian living. Those only are deceived by the miracle-working
power and sophistries of Satan who "received not the love of the truth." It
is one thing to have a form of godliness; it is quite another to have a "love
of the truth" born in the heart that will bind one to God and give such a
desire to know the Lord as will cause him to follow on to know his Saviour's
love until he is "filled with all the fullness of God." Eph. 3:19. Those who
so love truth will not be led astray by "cunningly devised fables."
  13. Why did God send them a strong delusion? 2 Thess. 2:11.
  14. What cause is given for their lack of belief? Verse 12.
   NoTE.—Again the apostle emphasizes an attitude that obtains in the lives
of many who profess a love for, and adherence to, truth. They "believed not
the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness." The two cannot be united.
One cannot truly believe and have pleasure in those things that are un-
righteous. A love of pleasure in the Christian leads to "a form of godliness"
but denies "the power thereof." There can be but one end of that road—re-
jection by the Lord and eternal death.



                 Lesson 11, for December 15, 1945

                  Comfort and Admonition
  MEMORY VERSE: "Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord
may have free course, and be glorified, even as it is with you." 2 Thess. 3:1.
  STUDY HELP: "The Acts of the Apostles," pages 266-268.

                    Standing Fast in Christ
    1. For what does the apostle feel bound to give thanks? 2 Thess.
2:13.
    2. What were the Thessalonians to obtain through their call by
the gospel? Verse 14.
    NOTE.—"Both the redeemed and the unfallen beings will find in the cross
of Christ their science and their song. It will be seen that the glory shining
in the face of Jesus is the glory of self-sacrificing love. In the light from
Calvary it will be seen that the law of self-renouncing love is the law of life
                                    [ Z4 1
for earth and heaven; that the love which `seeketh not her own' has its
source in the heart of God; and that in the meek and lowly One is manifested
the character of Him who dwelleth in the light which no man can approach
un10."—The Desire of Ages, page 20.
     3. In view of these assurances, what should believers do? To
what are they to hold? 2 Thess. 2:15.
     4. What had their loving Saviour given to the church? Verse 16.
     5. What results did the apostle expect in their lives? Verse 17.
    NorE.—God's gifts to His children are intended for a definite purpose
and work in human hearts and lives—that they may be stablished "in every
good word and work." God does not give that His gifts may be wasted
or consumed upon ourselves, but that we may serve. "As He is so are we in
this world." 1 John 4:17. He came "to seek and to save that which was lost."
Luke 19:10.
                            Final Admonitions
     6. For what did Paul especially ask the prayers of the Thessa-
lonian church? 2 Thess. 3:1.
    NoTE.—Notice the humility of the apostle. He acknowledges the presence
of the word of God in the lives of the Thessalonian Church, and asks their
prayers that the same word may have free course and be glorified in their
ministry.
     7. From whom did he wish to be delivered? Why? Verse 2.
     8. What witness does he bear to the Lord? Verse 3.
     9. In what did he have confidence concerning the believers?
Verse 4.
   10. How does this touching confidence in them parallel Christ's
attitude toward His disciples? John 17:9-11.
    NorE.—The Saviour's love for, and confidence in, His disciples is touch-
ingly portrayed in His prayer as recorded in John 17. Knowing their human
weaknesses, He could say, "None of them is lost, but the son of perdition"
 (verse 12), referring to Judas who betrayed Him. "For their sakes I sanctify
Myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth." Verse 19. Again
 He prays: "I in them, and Thou in Me, that they may be made perfect in
one." Verse 23. His love for His disciples was deep enough to lead Him to
 Calvary in their behalf. Their love for Him developed into a sacrificial
service for their Master which led them to endure hardship, trial, and per-
secution, and to die as martyrs for the Saviour whom they loved more than
life itself.
    11. Into what Christian graces did he desire the Lord to direct
 their hearts? 2 Thess. 3:5.
     NoTE.—How inclined the church has ever been to be impatient over the
 delayed return of our Lord We long for Him to come. Our souls groan
 within us as we see the evils growing in the world, and yet He delays His
 appearing. We are not ready! The world is not ready! The gospel of the
                                    1 253
kingdom has not been preached in all the world for a witness to all nations!
We are nearing that desired goal, but the work is not complete.
   "Had the purpose of God been carried out by His people in giving to the
world the message of mercy, Christ would, ere this, have come to the earth,
and the saints would have received their welcome into the city of God."—
Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 450.
   "Christ is waiting with longing desire for the manifestation of Himself
in His church. When the character of Christ shall be perfectly reproduced
in His people, then He will come to claim them as His own.
   "It is the privilege of every Christian, not only to look for, but to hasten
the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Were all who profess His name bearing
fruit to His glory, how quickly the whole world would be sown with the
seed of the gospel. Quickly the last great harvest would be ripened, and
Christ would come to gather the precious grain."—Christ's Object Lessons,
page 69.


                 Lesson 12, for December 22, 1945
               Warning and Encouragement
    MEMORY VERSE: "The Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and
into the patient waiting for Christ." 2 Thess. 3:5.
    STUDY HELP: "Gospel Workers," pages 234-238.

                 Warning Against Disorderliness
    1. What command does the apostle give concerning association
with disorderly church members? 2 Thess. 3:6.
   NOTE.—This is the word of the Lord, and the church which fails to heed
it will suffer. It is also worth while to study what it does not mean. It does
not mean ill-treatment of the person, nor arbitrary action in his absence, nor
voting him out of the church without labor with him, nor leaving our re-
sponsibility of his soul to others, nor sympathizing with him in his wrong
when someone has faithfully admonished him. It does not mean that any
un-Christlike course should be pursued toward him. It does not mean that
we should hold with him in the wrong, but rather that we should labor to
show him the wrong. The whole intent of the labor should not be to please
ourselves, but to please God by the conversion of the wrongdoer, if possible.
Read Matthew 18:15-17; Romans 14; Galatians 6:1, 2; James 5:19, 20. After
all gospel means are exhausted, then, for the sake of Christ's cause, take the
ultimate action of withdrawing from him, yet standing ever ready to help him.
    2. What did each member know he should do? 2 Thess. 3:7,
first part.
     3. What had been the attitude of the apostle and his helpers
while among them? Verse 7, last part.
     4. How had their daily food been provided while in Thessa-
lonica? How arduously had they labored? Verse 8.
   NorE.—"Work is a blessing, not a curse. A spirit of indolence destroys
                                    [ 261
godliness, and grieves the Spirit of God. A stagnant pool is offensive, but a
pure, flowing stream spreads health and gladness over the land. Paul knew that
those who neglect physical work soon become enfeebled. He desired to teach
young ministers that by working with their hands, by bringing into exercise
their muscles and sinews, they would become strong to endure the toils and
privations that awaited them in the gospel field."—Gospel Workers, pages
236, 237.
    5. What had been their purpose in such toil? 2 Thess. 3:9.
                  No Rewards Without Labor
    6. In this matter, what command had they given the church?
Verse 10.
    7. What had the apostle since heard concerning the conduct
of some of the membership? Verse 11.
   NOTE.—"Busybodies," "disorderly"—such are the terms the apostle uses
concerning some who professed godliness. There can be no indolent Chris-
tian. When such individuals are found, either inside or outside the church,
they are usually "busybodies," who walk "disorderly." A true Christian is
diligent, loyal to Christ and to his fellow Christians, faithful in daily life
and service, seeking only to glorify his Lord. A Christian is never weary of
doing good, of living righteously.
    8. What command does Paul give to those who thus walk?
Verse 12.
    9. In what were the believers never to become weary? Verse 13.
  10. What course should they take with those who were disobe-
dient regarding the instruction given? For what purpose? Verse 14.
  11. What further caution does the apostle add concerning their
relationship to such as disobeyed? Verse 15.
   Nora.—"Have no company with him," "yet count him not as an enemy."
This instruction is not always easy to carry out. The meaning, however, is
clear. While we are not to give the same fellowship to the disobedient as to
the loyal Christian, we are to admonish and counsel him, and to make it
our business to seek to redeem the lost one and reclaim him for Christ.
   12. What peace did Paul wish them to possess? Verse 16.
   13. How does he say he authenticates each epistle? Verse 17.
   14. What final benediction does he give to the Thessalonian
 brethren? Verse 18.


            The deeper we drink of the word, the more
                   we possess for blessing others.
                                     (27]
    NcrrE.—Paul's stay at Thessalonica was brief, yet there were gathered
into the church a goodly company of believers whose faith and devotion led
to his addressing these epistles to them. It is said in Acts 17:4 that some of
the Jews to whom he first preached Christ, believed and consorted with
 (joined themselves to) Paul and Silas, together with a great multitude of
devout Greeks, "and of the chief women not a few." Paul's stay was shortened
by persecutions which arose. He was "sent away" by the brethren.
    Following the dictation of this epistle, Paul affixes the salutation with
his own hand as evidence of his authorship. This prevented enemies of the
truth from circulating forged letters pretending to be his. Confusion had
already been brought into the churches because of this, as stated in 2 Thessa-
lonians 2:2.


                 Lesson 13, for December 29, 1945

                   Paul's Letter to Philemon
   MEMORY VERSE: "If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as
myself. If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee aught, put that on mine account."
Philemon 17, 18.
   STUDY HELP: "The Acts of the Apostles," pages 456-460.

                           Introductory Note
    Paul's letter to Philemon is a personal epistle, not one of instruction to
the church. He had brought to Christ an escaped slave who belonged to
Philemon, one Onesimus, and returns him with this letter to his master. Yet
with a delicacy and tactfulness that was both a plea for the Christian kindness
of Philemon toward Onesimus and a claim on Paul's part of the debt Phile-
mon owed to the apostle for bringing to him the knowledge of Christ Jesus,
Paul sought the recognition by Philemon that one who had become a brother
in Christ was more than a slave.
                            Paul's Salutatory
  1. How does Paul address Philemon and his household? Phile-
mon 1-3.
   NarE.—By some, Philemon was thought to have been a member of the
church at Colosse, and born in that city. Other writers think that he was
from Ephesus. He was evidently a person of some importance in his city,
and a sincere and active member of the Christian church, which met in his
house.
     2. For what does the apostle thank God concerning Philemon's
life and example? Verses 4, 5.
     3. To what end did he desire Philemon's faith to become ef-
fectual? Verse 6.
     4. What in the experience of Philemon had brought joy to Paul?
Verse 7.
                                    [ 28 ]
    NoTE.—The expression "bowels of the saints" is better understood in our
day as rendered in the Revised Version: "The hearts of the saints are refreshed
by thee." In Paul's day, the intestines, like the heart today, "were regarded
as the seat of the tender affections, especially kindness, benevolence, compas-
sion."—Pulpit Commentary. See also verse 20.
    The apostle here refers to the works of charity of Philemon who had
ministered of his bounties to the necessities of the saints. He had demon-
strated this love for his brethren not only in a spiritual way, but also by
caring for the poorer Christians who were members of the church. This
in itself gives evidence of the genuineness of Philemon's conversion to Christ.
Paul was not aged as we now look at old age. Authorities vary as to his age,
but evidently he was between fifty-five and sixty years old. But in years,
in service, in hardships endured, he was at an age where his counsel was to
be. valued.

                         In Behalf of Onesimus

   5. How Cloes Paul approach Philemon in behalf of Onesimus?
Philemon 8, 9.
   6. What does Paul state to be his relationship to Onesimus?
Verse 10.
   7. Since his conversion, what had Onesimus become to Paul?
Verse 11.
    8. For what did Paul ask? What would he have liked to do?
Why did he not retain Onesimus? Verses 12-14.
    NOTE.—Paul returns Onesimus to his master Philemon. That he was now
a Christian did not release him from his civil obligations. Yet because 'of
Onesimus's faithful ministry to the apostle, Paul pleads in his behalf with
Philemon, who himself was equally indebted to the apostle for his knowledge
of the saving grace of Christ. Indeed the apostle tactfully suggests, though
indirectly, that Philemon return Onesimus to serve him in his bonds to repay,
in a way, Philemon's debt to Paul for the light of the gospel.
   9. How beautifully does Paul state the new relationship of the
former slave? Verses 15, 16.
   10. What was Paul willing to do in Onesimus's behalf? Verses
17, 18.
   NOTE.—"Paul voluntarily proposed to assume the debt of Onesimus in
order that the guilty one might be spared the disgrace of punishment, and
might again enjoy the privileges he had forfeited. . . .
   "How fitting an illustration of the love of Christ for the repentant sinner!
The servant who had defrauded his master had nothing with which to make
restitution. The sinner who has robbed God of years of service has no means
of canceling the debt. Jesus interposes between the sinner and God, saying,
I will pay the debt. Let the sinner be spared; I will 'suffer in his stead."—The
Acts of the Apostles, page 458.
                                      [29]
   11. What did Philemon owe to the apostle? Verse 19.
    NOTE.—Onesimus had so faithfully served Paul that the apostle was willing
to have charged to his account any loss Philemon had sustained through
Onesimus's flight. Yet he reminded Philemon: "Thou owest unto me even
thine own self besides."
   12. What would compliance with Paul's plea do for the apostle?
Philemon 20.
   13. How confidently did the apostle look to a favorable response
from Philemon? Verse 21.
   14. To what was Paul also looking forward? Verse 22.
    NOTE.—When this letter to Philemon was written, Paul was near the
close of his first imprisonment in Rome. He trusted that through the
prayers of the believers, and God's grace, he might be liberated. Later the
faithful apostle was liberated, and he spent this extended period of oppor-
tunity in seeking to fortify the minds of the believers. However, it was not
many years until he was called upon to suffer imprisonment, and at last
death by the headsman's ax in Rome.
   15. In his benediction, who are especially mentioned? Verses
23-25.

              THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING

                              December 29

THE  overflow of the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering the last Sabbath of the
 quarter goes to the South American Division. One of the outstanding
needs of this field is the relocation of the training school in Peru. Twenty-
five years ago this school was in the rural section of Lima, but the- city has
grown to such a size that it now envelops the training school. The school
must be relocated at once, for a new road is in progress which cuts through
the school buildings. A new site has been secured a number of miles out of
the city, but the buildings for the training school must be erected. Many
workers in South America have received their education at this school, and
it is anticipated that many more will be graduated from this school.
     In 1943 when Sabbath school members gave toward the Rio de Janeiro
sanitarium project, there was a magnificent overflow of $23,804.26. Can we
not do even more for the erection of the new Inca Union Training School?
