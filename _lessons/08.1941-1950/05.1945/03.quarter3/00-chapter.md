                    THE WAY TO CHRIST

                       Lesson 1, for July 7, 1945
                         God's Love for Man
    MEMORY VERSE: "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only-be-
gotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting
life." John 3:16.
    STUDY HELPS: "Steps to Christ," chapter, "God's Love for Man;" "Testi-
monies," vol. 5, pp. 629-633, 738-740, "The Desire of Ages," pages 19-21, "Patriarchs
and Prophets," pages 63-66, "Christ's Object Lessons," pages 198-211 (new ed.,
pages 201-213).
                      Behold What Manner of Love
   1. What does John declare God to be? 1 John 4:8, 16.
   NoTE.—"All the paternal love which has come down from generation to
generation through the channel of human hearts, all the springs of tenderness
which have opened in the souls of men, are but as a tiny rill to the boundless
ocean, when compared with the infinite, exhaustless love of God. Tongue can-
not utter it; pen cannot portray it. You may meditate upon it every day of
your life; you may search the Scriptures diligently in order to understand it;
you may summon every power and capability that God has given you, in the
endeavor to comprehend the love and compassion of the heavenly Father;
and yet there is an infinity beyond: ... Eternity itself can never fully reveal it.
Yet as we study the Bible, and meditate upon the life of Christ and the plan
of redemption, these great themes will open to our understanding more and
more."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 740.
   2. In what words did John express his amazement at the unfath-
omable love of God? 1 John 3:1, first part.
   NoTE.—"God is love. He has a care for the creatures He has formed. 'Like
as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear Him."Behold,
what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be
called the sons of God.' What a precious privilege is this, that we may be sons
and daughters of the Most High, heirs of God and joint heirs with Jesus
Christ."—Testimonies, vol. 5, pp. 315, 316.
                      The Quality of Divine Love
   3. What is the greatest evidence of human love? John 15:13.
How much greater is divine love? Rom. 5:6-8; Eph. 2:4, 5.
   Nora.—"O, the mystery of redemption! the love of God for a world that
did not love Him! Who can know the depths of that love which `passeth
knowledge'? Through endless ages, immortal minds, seeking to comprehend
the mystery of that incomprehensible love, will wonder and adore."—Patri-
archs and Prophets, pages 63, 64.
   4. In what words are we assured of God's unchangeableness?
How enduring is His love? Mal. 3:6; James 1:17; Jer. 31:3.
                                  [3]
   NOTE.—"A golden chain, the mercy and compassion of divine love, is
passed around every imperiled soul. The Lord declares, 'I have loved thee
with an everlasting love.' "—Christ's Object Lessons, page 202.
   5. How far-reaching is the fullness of God's love as revealed in
Christ? Eph. 3:17-19.
   NOTE.—The love of Christ has a breadth that embraces the whole human
race, a length that extends from eternity to eternity, a depth that reaches
the lowest extremity of the miry pit of sin and saves "to the uttermost," a
height that ascends to the highest heavens and lifts fallen man to the throne of
the Most High.
                 The Supreme Manifestation of Love
   6. What was the greatest demonstration of God's love for a lost
world? John 3:16; 1 John 4:9, 10.
   NOTE—"The glorious plan of man's salvation was brought about through
the infinite love of God the Father. In this divine plan is seen the most mar-
velous manifestation of the love of God to the fallen race. Such love as is
manifested in the gift of God's beloved Son amazed the holy angels. 'God so
loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth
in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.' "—Testimonies, vol. 2,
p. 200.
   7. What enormous price was paid for man's redemption? 1 Peter
1:18, 19.
   NOTE.—"A11 men have been bought with this infinite price."—Christ's Ob-
ject Lessons, page 326.
    8. Who only could redeem man? Acts 4:12.
    NoTE.—"Humanity has no power to regenerate itself. It does not tend
upward, toward the divine, but downward, toward the satanic. Christ is our
only hope. 'There is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby
we must be saved.' Neither is there salvation in any other.' "—Patriarchs
and Prophets, page 73.
    "In all the universe there was but one who could, in behalf of man, satisfy
its claims. Since the divine law is as sacred as God Himself, only one equal
with God could make atonement for its transgression. None but Christ could
redeem fallen man from the curse of the law, and bring him again into har-
mony with Heaven....
    "The angels prostrated themselves at the feet of their Commander, and
offered to become a sacrifice for man. But an angel's life could not pay the
debt ; only He who created man had power to redeem him."—Ibid., pages
63-65.
   9. How fully is God the Father identified with this matchless
demonstration of love? 2 Cor. 5:19.
   NOTE.—"He [Satan' had accused God of seeking merely the exaltation of
Himself in requiring submission and obedience from His creatures, and had
declared that while the Creator exacted self-denial from all others, He Himself
practiced no self-denial and made no sacrifice. Now it was seen that for the
salvation of a fallen and sinful race, the Ruler of the universe had made the
greatest sacrifice which love could make; for 'God was in Christ, reconciling
the world unto Himself' "—The Great Controversy, page 502.
                                     [4]
            The Drawing Power of God's Love
  10. With what does God draw us? Jer. 31:3.
   NorE.—"The Lord declares by His prophet, 'I have loved thee with an
everlasting love: therefore with loving-kindness have I drawn thee.' While
the sinner is yet far from the Father's house, ... the Father's heart is yearning
over him; . .. wooing, entreating, drawing the wanderer to his Father's heart
of love."—Steps to Christ, page 59. ,
  11. What is it that leads the sinner to repentance? Rom. 2:4.
   NOTE.—"The love of God still yearns over the one who has chosen to
separate from Him, and He sets in operation influences to bring him back to
the Father's house. . . . It is the assurance of God's love that constrains the
sinner to return to God. 'The goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance.' "
—Christ's Object Lessons, page 202.
   12. In response to this wooing of the divine love, what should
be the sinner's attitude? And with what assurance? Luke 15:18, 20;
Isa. 55:6, 7.
   NoTE.—"Arise and go to your Father. He will meet you a great way off.
If you take even one step toward Him in repentance, He will hasten to enfold
you in His arms of infinite love."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 206.


                      Lesson 2, for July 14, 1945
                 The Sinner's Need of Christ
   MEMORY VERSE: "Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none
other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved." Acts 4:12.
   STUDY HELP: "Steps to Christ," chapter, "The Sinner's Need of Christ."

                 The Hopeless State of the Sinner
   1. How does the prophet describe the condition of the human
race as the result of the fall? Isa. 53:6, first part.
   2. How universally has mankind been degraded by the curse of
sin? Ps. 14:1-3; Rom. 3:10-12.
   3. What terrible picture of sin and its results is given by the
apostle Paul? Rom. 1:21-23.
   4. Before being quickened by the power of the gospel, what is
the nature and state of the sinner? How does he walk? Whose
spirit controls him? Eph. 2:1-3.
   5. How is the hopeless state of those who are without Christ
further described? How only is the situation completely changed?
Verses 12-14.
   NoTE.—"In the religion of Christ there is a regenerating influence that
transforms the entire being, lifting man above every debasing, groveling vice,
and raising the thoughts and desires toward God and heaven. Linked to the
Infinite One, man is made partaker of the divine nature. Upon him the shafts
of evil have no effect; for he is clothed with the panoply of Christ's righteous-
ness."—Counsels to Teachers, pages 51, 52.
                                        f 5]
                       Man's Great Enemy
  6. For what reason is man admonished to sobriety and vigilance?
1 Peter 5:8.
  7. What are some of the names applied to this great enemy? How
universal has been his deception? Rev. 12:9; 2 Cor. 4:4; John 12:31.
  8. Against what devices of Satan are we warned? Eph. 6:11, 16;
2 Tim. 2:26.
  NOTE.—"Having been taken captive by him unto his will," is the American
Revised Version of 2 Timothy 2:26. "Taken alive" is the marginal reading
which indicates that Satan's chief ambition is to capture man and place him
under the bondage of sin.
                         The Hope of Deliverance
     9. According to prophecy, what would be the glorious results
of the gift of Christ to the world? Isa. 42:6, 7; 49:24, 25.
     NoTE.—"None have fallen so low, none are so vile, but that they may find
deliverance in Christ.... No cry from a soul in need, though it fail of utterance
in words, will be unheeded. Those who consent to enter into covenant with
God are not left to the power of Satan or to the infirmity of their own nature.
. . . 'Thus saith the Lord, Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken
away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered.' "—The Ministry of
Healing, page 93.
     10. How comprehensive is the plan of salvation? What is the
God-man called? 1 Tim. 2:3-6.
     NoTE.—"Among all nations, kindreds, and tongues, He sees men and women
who are praying for light and knowledge. Their souls are unsatisfied: long
have they fed on ashes. The enemy of all righteousness has turned them aside,
and they grope as blind men. But they are honest in heart, and desire to
learn a better way. Although in the depths of heathenism, with no knowledge
of the written law of God nor of His Son Jesus, they have revealed in mani-
fold ways the working of a divine power on mind and character. . . . The
 `Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world,' is shining in
 his soul; and this Light, if heeded, will guide his feet to the kingdom of God.
 . . . Heaven's plan of salvation is broad enough to embrace the whole world.
 God longs to breathe into prostrate humanity the breath of life. And He will
 not permit any soul to be disappointed who is sincere in his longing for some-
 thing higher and nobler than anything the world can off er."—Prophets and
 Kings, pages 376-378.
     11. How complete was Christ's victory over sin? John 14:30;
16:33.
      NOTE.—" 'The prince of this world cometh,' said Jesus, 'and hath nothing
 in Me.' There was in Him nothing that responded to Satan's sophistry. He did
 not consent to sin. Not even by a thought did He yield to temptation. So it
 may be with us. Christ's humanity was united with divinity; He was fitted
 for the conflict by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit."—The Desire of Ages,
 page 123.
      "The Father's presence encircled Christ, and nothing befell Him but that
 which infinite love permitted for the blessing of the world. Here was His
 source of comfort, and it is for us. He who is imbued with the Spirit of
                                        [6]
Christ abides in Christ. Whatever comes to him comes from the Saviour, who
surrounds him with His presence. Nothing can touch him except by the Lord's
permission. All our sufferings and sorrows, all our temptations and trials,
all our sadness and griefs, all our persecutions and privations, in short, all
things work together for our good. All experiences and circumstances are
God's workmen whereby good is brought to us."—The Ministry of Healing,
page 489.
   12. What experience is possible to those who are born of God?
What is the secret of their victory? How complete is' their triumph?
1 John 5:18, 19.
   NOTE.—The wording of verse 18, according to the Greek, may be ren-
dered: " 'We know that everyone born of God does not continue in sin (or,
does not make a habit of sin), but he that is born of God keeps himself, and
the wicked one does not touch him.' The secret of complete victory over the
evil one is the keeping power of God through the indwelling Christ."
   "When the soul surrenders itself to Christ, a new power takes possession
of the new heart. A change is wrought which man can never accomplish
for himself. It is a supernatural work, bringing a supernatural element into
human nature. The soul that is yielded to Christ, becomes His own fortress,
which He holds in a revolted world, and He intends that no authority shall
be known in it but His own. A soul thus kept in possession by the heavenly
agencies, is impregnable to the assaults of Satan."—The Desire of Ages, pages
323, 324.

                     Lesson 3, for July 21, 1945
                              Repentance
    MEMORY VERSE: "Repent, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions;
so iniquity shall not be your ruin." Ezek. 18:30.
    STUDY HELP: "Steps to Christ," chapter, "Repentance."

                           A Change of Mind
   1. On what basis will divine judgment be meted out to the trans-
gressor? What should this knowledge lead the sinner to do? What
is the ultimate result of iniquity? Ezek. 18:30.
   NoTE.—Repentance is thus defined: "Repentance includes sorrow for sin,
and a turning away from it. We shall not renounce sin unless we see its sin-
fulness; until we turn away from it in heart, there will be no real change in
the life."—Steps to Christ, page 26.
   2. How are the steps in true repentance further described? How
is the love of God set forth in His dealings with sinners? Verses 31,
32; 33:11.
   3. How completely does repentance change a person's mind to-
ward God and others? Phil. 2:4, 5.
   NoTE.—The mind of Jesus will lead us to believe His word and think His
thoughts after Him. We are told that as a man "thinketh in his heart, so is he."
Therefore thinking with the mind of Christ will result in Christlike conduct
and character. Controlled by the Spirit of Christ we will always have the
proper attitude toward God and man, as well as all the experiences of life.
                                      7
   4. What did the mind of Jesus lead Him to do? What has been
the result of His humble attitude? Verses 6-10.
   NOTE.—"This was a voluntary sacrifice. Jesus might have remained at the
Father's side. He might have retained the glory of heaven, and the homage
of the angels. But He chose to give back the scepter into the Father's hands,
and to step down from the throne of the universe, that He might bring light to
the benighted, and life to the perishing."—The Desire of Ages, page 23.
                         A Prelude to Conversion
   5. What effect did Peter's sermon on the Day of Pentecost have
on the hearts of his hearers? What request did the conscience-
stricken sinners make? Acts 2:37.
   6. What answer did the apostle Peter give? What promise was
made? Verse 38.
   7. In a later sermon, what accusation did Peter boldly bring
against the Jews and their leaders? How did he excuse them? What
did their ignorance lead them to do unconsciously? Acts 3:13-15,
17, 18.
   8. What appeal was made to those guilty of the sin of ignorance?
What will eventually be done with the sins of those who are con-
verted? What experience will accompany the blotting out of sin?
Verse 19.
   NOTE.—"God calls for a spiritual revival and a spiritual reformation. Uri-
less this takes place, those who are lukewarm will continue to grow more
abhorrent to the Lord, until He will refuse to acknowledge them as His chil-
dren. A revival and a reformation must take place, under the ministration
of the Holy Spirit. Revival and reformation are two different things. Revival
signifies a renewal, of spiritual life, a quickening of the powers of mind and
heart, a resurrection from spiritual death. Reformation signifies a reorgani-
zation, a change in ideas and theories, habits and practices. Reformation will
not bring forth the good fruit of righteousness unless it is connected with the
revival of the Spirit. Revival and reformation are to do their appointed work,
and in doing this work they must blend."—Mrs. E. G. White, in Review and
Herald, Feb. 25, 1902.
                               Sorrow For Sin
   9. Through what means does God bring conviction of sin? What
other convictions come in their order? John 8:9; 16:7, 8; margin
"convince."
    NOTE.—The first mission of the Holy Spirit is to prick the conscience and
bring conviction of sin. After convincing sinners of what is wrong, the next
work of the Spirit is to convince them of what is right or of righteousness.
This is followed by conviction of a coming judgment, when all will be judged
according to their attitude toward good and evil. The importance of the law
in the mission of the Spirit and the work of the gospel is evident from the
fact that "sin is the transgression of the law," and "by the law is the knowl-
edge of sin," and righteousness is conformity in conduct to the divine stand-
ard of right and justice, ruled by the law of God, for the law is God's stand-
ard of righteousness. In the judgment all will be measured by the law: "So
speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty."
                                     [8 ]
   10. Through whom only is repentance and confession possible?
Acts 4:12; 5:31.
   NOTE.—"We can no more repent without the Spirit of Christ to awaken the
conscience than we can be pardoned without Christ. Christ is the source of
every right impulse. He is the only one that can implant in the heart enmity
against sin. Every desire for truth and purity, every conviction of our own
sinfulness, is an evidence that His Spirit is moving upon our hearts."—Steps
to Christ, page 30.
    11. To what does sorrow for sin lead? What, in turn, is the
result of godly sorrow for sin? 2 Cor. 7:9, 10.
    NoTE.—"We often sorrow because our evil deeds bring unpleasant conse-
quences to ourselves; but this is not repentance. Real sorrow for sin is the
result of the working of the Holy Spirit. The Spirit reveals the ingratitude
of the heart that has slighted and grieved the Saviour, and brings us in con-
trition to the foot of the cross. By every sin Jesus is wounded afresh; and
as we look upon Him whom we have pierced, we mourn for the sins that
have brought anguish upon Him. Such mourning will lead to the renunciation
of sin. . . . The tears of the penitent are only the raindrops that precede the
sunshine of holiness."—The Desire of Ages, page 300.
   12. What works of reformation result from genuine repentance
produced by godly sorrow for sin? What effect did this transforma-
tion of character have on Paul? Verses 11, 16.                                 .
   NoTE.—This was the work which, operating in the hearts and lives of the
disciples in the upper room, banished strife, envy, and suspicion, and produced
unity and restored confidence. Pentecostal power was the result. This experi-
ence is to be repeated in the remnant of the church, and will be followed by a
repetition of spiritual refreshing in the showers of the latter rain. "Not one of
us will ever receive the seal of God while our characters have one spot or
stain upon them. It is left with us to remedy the defects in our characters, to
cleanse the soul temple of every defilement. Then the latter rain will fall upon
us as the early rain fell upon the disciples on the Day of Pentecost."—Testi-
monies, vol. 5, p. 214.



                      Lesson 4, for July 28, 1945

                               Confession
   MEMORY VERSE: "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive
us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness." 1 John 1:9.
   STUDY HELP: "Steps to Christ," chapter, "Confession."

                         Acknowledgment of Sin
   1. What will always accompany true repentance? What experi-
ence should follow conviction and acknowledgment of transgres-
sion? Jer. 3:13, 14.
   NOTE.—It takes courage to say, "I was wrong," "I made a mistake," "I
have sinned;" but it gives evidence of largeness of soul and nobleness of char-
                                     [9]
acter. It is a princely act that brings the respect of man and the approval
of God.
   "Confession will not be acceptable to God without sincere repentance and
reformation. There must be decided changes in the life; everything offensive
to God must be put away. This will be the result of genuine sorrow for sin."
—Steps to Christ, page 44.
   2. What blessed experience is available to all sinners? What two
steps brought this blessing to David? Ps. 32:1, 2, 5.
   3. To what sin and experience did David doubtless refer? 2 Sam.
12:1-13.
   4. What fact was demonstrated in the bitter experience of King
David? Num. 32:23, last part.
   5. What statement shows the impossibility of hiding sin? Heb.
4:13.
   NOTE.—There are no strictly secret sins. Sin lures and deceives its victim
and then exposes his guilt. If sin does not tell on us in this life, it will expose
us before the heavenly tribunal when the books of record are opened. Then
"every secret thing" that was not acknowledged, confessed, and forgiven in
this life will be revealed.
    "True confession is always of a specific character, and acknowledges par-
ticular sins. They may be of such a nature as to be brought before God only;
they may be wrongs that should be confessed to individuals who have suffered
injury through them; or they may be of a public character, and should then
be as publicly confessed. But all confession should be definite and to the
point, acknowledging the very sins of which you are guilty."—Steps to Christ,
page 43.
  6. What beautiful prayer indicates the sincerity of David's con-
fession? For what did he ask in order that the same sin would not
be repeated? Ps. 51:1-7, 10.
                     The Basis of Hope
  7. On what basis may sinners hope for forgiveness of sin? Rom.
2:4.
   NOTE.—"Miserable as he was, the prodigal found hope in the conviction
of his father's love. It was that love which was drawing him toward home.
So it is the assurance of God's love that constrains the sinner to return to
God. 'The goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance.' A golden chain, the
mercy and compassion of divine love, is passed around every imperiled soul.'
The Lord declares, 'I have loved thee with an everlasting love; therefore
with lovingkindness have I drawn thee.' "—Christ's Object Lessons, page 202.
   8. What comfort may sinners find in the Lord's proclamation to
Moses concerning His character? What did this revelation cause
Moses to do? Ex. 34:6-8.
   9. What is the sure result of attempting to hide or cover one's
sins? To whom only is mercy extended? Prov. 28:13.
   10. Of what does self-justification and boasting give evidence?
What is the attitude of those who are really righteous? Job 9:20, 21.
                                [101
                     Self-Righteousness Condemned
    11. How did Jesus illustrate the difference between the self-
righteous and the penitent? Luke 18:9-14.
    NOTE.—"There is nothing so offensive to God, or so dangerous to the human
soul, as pride and self-sufficiency. Of all sins it is the most hopeless, the most
incurable."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 154.
    "No outward observances can take the place of simple faith and entire
renunciation of self. But no man can empty himself of self. We can only
consent for Christ to accomplish the work. Then the language of the soul
will be, Lord, take my heart; for I cannot give it. It is Thy property. Keep
it pure, for I cannot keep it for Thee. Save me in spite of myself, my weak,
un-Christlike self. Mold me, fashion me, raise me into a pure and holy atmos-
phere, where the rich current of Thy love can flow through my soul."—Ibid.,
page 159.
    12. When Job got a vision of the character of God, what change
took place in his opinion of self? What was the result of the change?
Job 40:4, 5; 42:5, 6, 10.
    NOTE.—"The nearer we come to Jesus, and the more clearly we discern the
purity of His character, the more clearly we shall discern the exceeding sin-
 fulness of sin, and the less we shall feel like exalting ourselves. Those whom
heaven recognizes as holy ones are the last to parade their own goodness."—
 Christ's Object Lessons, page 160.
    13. What is necessary to continual cleansing from sin? What is
said of those who boast that they are free from sin? 1 John 1:7, 8.
     NOTE.—"Let the recording angels write the history of the holy struggles
 and conflicts of the people of God; let them record their prayers and tears;
 but let not God be dishonored by the declaration from human lips, 'I am
 sinless; I am holy' Sanctified lips will never give utterance to such presump-
 tuous words. . 'If we,' says John, not separating himself from his brethren,
 `say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.' "—
 The Acts of the Apostles, pages 561, 562.
     14. What definite promise is made to those who confess their
 sins? Of what terrible sin are those guilty who claim that they have
  not sinned? What does such boasting prove? Verses 9, 10.
     NOTE.—"Confession of sin, whether public or private, should be heartfelt,
 and freely expressed. It is not to be urged from the sinner. It is not to be
  made in a flippant and careless way, or forced from those who have no realizing
 sense of the abhorrent character of sin. The confession that is the outpouring
  of the inmost soul finds its way to the God of infinite pity. . . . True con-
  fession is always of a specific character, and acknowledges particular sins. . . .
  Confession will not be acceptable to God without sincere repentance and ref-
  ormation. There must be decided changes in the life; everything offensive
  to God must be put away. This will be the result of genuine sorrow for sin."

                    Lesson 5, for August 4, 1945
                             Consecration
   MEMORY VERSE: "Who then is willing to consecrate his service this day
unto the Lord?" 1 Chron. 29:5.
   STUDY HELP: "Steps to Christ," chapter, "Consecration."

                  Consecration of Heart and Life
  1. Before Aaron and his sons were permitted to minister in the
priest's office, what rites of consecration were observed? Ex. 28:4,
40-43; 29:1-9, 20, 21.
   NoTE.—Consecration means devotion or dedication to a cause. It means
to make holy or set apart for a holy use.
  2. What was involved in the consecration of the Levitical priest.
hood? Mal. 2:4-7.
   NOTE.—"I entreat all, especially those who minister in word and doctrine,
to make an unreserved surrender to God. Consecrate your lives to Him, and
be indeed ensamples to the flock. Be no longer content to remain dwarfs in
spiritual things. Let your aim be nothing short of perfection of Christian
character."—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 521.
   3. What message to ancient Israel shows that God intended that
all His people should measure up to the same standard of holiness
set for the priesthood? Ex. 19:5, 6.
   4. What beautiful statement sets forth the results of complete
consecration on the part of God's people? 1 Peter 2:9.
   NOTE.—"Peculiar" as used here does not mean "queer, strange, odd, eccen-
tric, or off-center." It carries the older sense of that which is separated for
the owner's special use. "A purchased people" is the marginal reading. "A
people for God's own possession," "the people who belong to Him," "a secured
people," "a people for a special possession," and "a people belonging specially
to God," are other translations. "A purchased people, a private property, be-
longing to God Almighty, none other having any right in them, and they
being under obligation to God alone."—Dr. Adam Clarke.

                 Wholehearted Surrender
  5. How completely did Christ surrender His will to the Father?
Luke 22:41, 42.
   NoTE.—"The warfare against self is the greatest battle that was ever
fought. The yielding of self, surrendering all to the will of God, requires a
struggle; but the soul must submit to God before it can be renewed in holi-
ness."—Steps to Christ, page 47.
  6. What state of mind is necessary to wholehearted surrender
and consecration? What is promised to all who seek this experience?
1 Chron. 29:9; Jer. 29:13.
  7. What appeal shows that we are all free moral agents with the
power of choice? What glorious promise follows? Isa. 1:18, 19.
  NorE.—"Desires for goodness and holiness are right as far as they go;
but if you stop here, they will avail nothing. Many will be lost while hoping
                                     [ 12 ]
and desiring to be Christians. They do not come to the point of yielding
the will to God. They do not now choose to be Christians. Through the
right exercise of the will, an entire change may be made in your life. By
yielding up your will to Christ, you ally yourself with the power that is
above all principalities and powers. You will have strength from above
to hold you steadfast, and thus through constant surrender to God you will
be enabled to live the new life, even the life of faith."—Steps to Christ,
page 52.
   D. L. Moody said: "All true prayer must be offered in full submission to
God. . . . I would a thousand times rather that God's will should be done
than my own. I cannot see into the future as God can ; therefore, it is a
good deal better to let Him choose for me than to choose for myself."—Pre-
vailing Prayer, page 102.
  8. What prayer did Christ offer in behalf of His disciples?
Through what means were they to be sanctified or consecrated? Who
were included in this request? John 17:15-17, 20.
                     Consecration for Service
   9. For what purpose did Christ set Himself apart in sanctifica-
tion? What responsibility does He place on every Christian? Verses
18, 19.
   NOTE.—"Christ has made provision that His church shall be a transformed
body, illumined with the light of heaven, possessing the glory of Immanuel.
It is His purpose that every Christian shall be surrounded with a spiritual
atmosphere of light and peace. There is no limit to the usefulness of the
one who, putting self aside, makes room for the working of the Holy Spirit
upon his heart, and lives a life wholly consecrated to God."—Testimonies,
vol. 8, p. 19.
  10. In God's oath to Abraham, what was included? How long
should this devotion continue? Luke 1:73-75.
  11. What appeal is made for personal, willing, and daily conse-
crated service? 1 Chron. 29:5, last part.
  NOTE.—"The time demands greater efficiency and deeper consecration."—
Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 27. "We are coming to a crisis which, more than any
previous time since the world began, will demand the entire consecration of
everyone who has named the name of Christ."—Gospel Workers, page 323.
   12. Through whom is complete consecration possible? What at-
titude should we therefore manifest? 1 Cor. 1:29-31.


                    Lesson 6 for August 11, 1945
                     Faith and Acceptance
    MEMORY VERSE: "Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence
of things not seen." Heb. 11:1.
    STUDY HELP: "Steps to Christ," chapter, "Faith and Acceptance."
                     Confidence in the Word
   1. How important is faith in Christian experience? What two
things are involved in true faith? Heb. 11:6.
                                     [ 13 ]
  2. After relating the parable of the widow and the unjust judge,
what question of Jesus indicates a scarcity of faith in the last days?
Luke 18:7, 8.
  NOTE.—"We may achieve victories which our own erroneous and mis-
conceived opinions, our own defects of character, our own smallness of faith,
have made to seem impossible. Faith ! we scarcely know what it is."—Testi-
monies to Ministers, page 187.
   3. How is faith defined? Heb. 11:1.
   NoTE.—Most of the things Christians hope for are invisible and can be seen
only through the eye of faith. Of Christ's temptation in the wilderness we read:
"In every temptation the weapon of His warfare was the word of God.
Satan demanded of Christ a miracle as a sign of His divinity. But that which
is greater than all miracles, a firm reliance upon a 'thus saith the Lord,' was
a sign that could not be controverted. So long as Christ held to this position,
the tempter could gain no advantage."—The Desire of Ages, page 120.
   4. What is the difference between things seen through natural
and through spiritual vision? 2 Cor. 4:18.
   NOTE.—"The faith of Moses led him to look at the things which are un-
seen, which are eternal. He left the splendid attractions of court life be-
cause sin was there. He gave up present and seeming good that flattered,
only to ruin and destroy. The real attractions, the eternal, were of value
to him. The sacrifices made by Moses were really no sacrifices. With him it
was letting go a present, apparent, flattering good, for a sure, high, immortal
good.
   "Moses endured the reproach of Christ, considering reproach greater
riches than all the treasures of Egypt. He believed what God had said, and
was not influenced to swerve from his integrity by any of the world's re-
proaches. He walked the earth as God's freeman. He had the love of Christ
in his soul, which not only made him a man of dignity, but added the luster
of the true Christian graces to the dignity of the man. Moses walked a rough
and perilous path; but he looked to the things unseen, and faltered not. The
recompense of reward was attractive to him, and it may be also to us. He
was familiar with God."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 345.
   5. How is the divine definition of faith illustrated? Heb. 11:3.
   NOTE.—Only by believing the Scriptural record can we understand and
believe in creation. No person living today witnessed the beginning of things
material, and, therefore, what man says can be only conjecture. Nor can
creation be demonstrated. God was not only a living witness of creation, but
He was the Creator and, therefore, His word is the only reliable account
available. Believing the Biblical record of creation is evidence of things
unseen by man.
   6. What further illustration is given in this great chapter on
faith? Verse 7.
   NorE.—Since there was no evidence in sight of the coming Flood, faith
in the word of God was evidence of "things not seen as yet." Noah's faith was
demonstrated by his works. "By faith" he "moved." Genuine faith always
moves to action and obedience. Faith that only acknowledges truth, but
does not obey, is declared to be "dead," and therefore worthless.
                                     14
    7. What did "seeing Him who is invisible" lead Moses to do?
Verses 24-27.
    NOTE.—"Moses did not merely think of God, he saw Him. God was the
constant vision before him. Never did he lose sight of His face. To Moses
faith was no guesswork; it was a reality. He believed that God ruled his
life in particular; and in all its details he acknowledged Him. For strength
to withstand every temptation, he trusted in Him. The great work assigned
him he desired to make in the highest degree successful, and he placed his
whole dependence upon divine power. He felt his need of help, asked for it,
by faith grasped it, and in the assurance of sustaining strength went forward.
Such was the experience that Moses gained by his forty years of training
in the desert. To impart such an experience, Infinite Wisdom counted not
the period too long or the price too great."—Education, pages 63, 64.
                       Faith the Victory
  8. What experience must accompany faith if we would be victors
over the world? 1 John 5:4.
  9. In whom must our faith center in order for it to have over-
coming power? When and where is this victory promised? 1 Cor.
15:57; 2 Cor. 2:14.
   10. What is the secret of increasing faith? Rom. 10:17.
   Nora.—"Only he who has true faith is secure against presumption. For
presumption is Satan's counterfeit of faith. Faith claims God's promises, and
brings forth fruit in obedience. . . . Genuine faith has its foundation in the
promises and provisions of the Scriptures."—The Desire of Ages, page 126.
   "It is not enough to believe about Christ; we must believe in Him. The
only faith that will benefit us is that which embraces Him as a personal
Saviour; which appropriates His merits to ourselves. Many hold faith as an
opinion. Saving faith is a transaction by which those who receive Christ join
themselves in covenant relation with God. Genuine faith is life. A living
faith means an increase of vigor, a confiding trust, by which the soul becomes
a conquering power."—Ibid., page 347.
   11. What experience of Jesus illustrated the fact that genuine
faith is simple dependence on the word of God? What did Jesus
say of the centurion's faith? Matt. 8:5-10.
   NOTE.—Faith like holiness "is not rapture: it is an entire surrender of
the will to God; it is living by every word that proceeds from the mouth of
God; it is doing the will of our heavenly Father; it is trusting God in trial,
in darkness as well as in the light; it is walking by faith and not by sight; it is
relying on God with unquestioning confidence, and resting in His love."—T he
Acts of the Apostles, page 51.
   12. To what is faith likened? How important is faith in the Chris-
tian warfare? Eph. 6:16.
  13. What glorious promise is made to those who exercise faith?
What plea should this cause us to make? Mark 9:23, 24.
  NoTE.—"Faith and love,—how destitute are the churches of these !"—Testi-
monies to Ministers, page 149.

                   Lesson 7, for August 18, 1945
                   The Test of Discipleship
    MEMORY VERSE: "This is love, that we walk after His commandments. This
is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk
in it." 2 John 6.
    STUDY HELP: "Steps to Christ," chapter, "The Test of Discipleship."

                      The Two Kingdoms
  1. By what two terms are worldlings designated? To whose king-
dom do they belong? Eph. 2:2, 3.
  2. What solemn warning is given against the kingdom of dark-
ness? What is the only hope of victory? Eph. 6:11-13.
  NOTE.—"There are Christians who think and speak altogether too much
about the power of Satan. They think of their adversary, they pray about
him, they talk about him, and he looms up greater and greater in their
imagination. It is true that Satan is a powerful being; but, thank God, we
have a mighty Saviour, who cast out the evil one from heaven. Satan is
pleased when we magnify his power. Why not talk of Jesus? Why not mag-
nify His power and His love?"—The Desire of Ages, page 493.
   3. What does Paul cite as an occasion for thanksgiving? Col.
1:13.
   4. How is this new creation brought about? How complete is
the change? 2 Cor. 5:17.
   NOTE.—"Through the power of Christ men and women have broken the
chains of sinful habit. They have renounced selfishness. The profane have
become reverent, the drunken sober, the profligate pure. Souls that have
borne the likeness of Satan have become transformed into the image of God.
This change is in itself the miracle of miracles."—The Acts of the Apostles,
page 476.
   "The Christian's life is not a modification or improvement of the old, but
a transformation of nature. There is a death to self and sin, and a new life
altogether."—The Desire of Ages, page 172.
                Evidence of Love and Citizenship
   5. What promise was made to ancient Israel on condition of
diligent .obedience? Deut. 28:1.
   6. What severe rebuke was delivered to King Saul because of his
disobedience? What terms are used to describe the evil of disobe-
dience? How serious was Saul's transgression? 1 Sam. 15:22, 23.
   7. Who will inherit the new earth? What will happen to those
who refuse and rebel? Rev. 22:14, 15; Isa. 1:19, 20.
   NOTE.—"The warfare against God's law, which was begun in heaven, will
be continued until the end of time. Every man will be tested. Obedience or
disobedience is the question to be decided by the whole world. All will be
called to choose between the law of God and the laws of men. Here the
dividing line will be drawn. There will be but two classes. Every character
will be fully developed; and all will show whether they have chosen the side
of loyalty or that of rebellion."—The Desire of Ages, page 763.
                                     [ 161
   8. What did Jesus declare to be the motive of true obedience?
John 14: 15, 21, 23, 24.
   NOTE.—"If ye love Me, ye will keep My commandments," is the Revised
Version.
   "There are those who profess to serve God, while they rely upon their
own efforts to obey His law, to form a right character, and secure salvation.
Their hearts are not moved by any deep sense of the love of Christ, but they
seek to perform the duties of the Christian life as that which God requires
of them in order to gain heaven. Such religion is worth nothing. When Christ
dwells in the heart, the soul will be so filled with His love, with the joy of
communion with Him, that it will cleave to Him ; and in the contemplation
of Him, self will be forgotten. Love to Christ will be the spring of action... .
A profession of Christ without this deep love, is mere talk, dry formality,
and heavy drudgery."—Steps to Christ, page 49.
   9. How is love defined by the apostle? 1 John 5:3; 2 John 6.
   NOTE.—"The fountain of the heart must be purified before the streams
can become pure. He who is trying to reach heaven by his own works in keep-
ing the law is attempting an impossibility. There is no safety for one who
has merely a legal religion, a form of godliness."—The Desire of Ages, page 172.
   10. How is obedience again set forth as the evidence of love and
discipleship? 1 John 2:3-6.
   NOTE.—"We may be active, we may do much work; but without love,
such love as dwelt in the heart of Christ, we can never be numbered with
the family of heaven."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 158.
   "It is not the greatness of the work, but the love with which it is done,
the motive underlying the action, that determines its worth."—Testimonies,
vol. 5, p. 279.
    It is the service of love that God values. When this is lacking, the mere
round of ceremony is an offense to Him."—The Desire of Ages, page 286.
   11. How does the apostle Paul set forth the relationship between
love and keeping of the law? Rom. 13:8, 10.
    12. In what language did the wise man set forth the whole duty
of man? What reason is given for the necessity of strict obedience?
Eccl. 12:13, 14.
    NOTE.—The margin of the Revised Version gives, "The duty of all men."
    13. Why must our lives be regulated by the law of God? James
2:8-12.
    14. 'How did Jesus summarize the two tables of the Decalogue?
 How much of divine revelation is embraced in the law of God?
Matt. 22:36-40.
    NorE.—"All true obedience comes from the heart. It was heart work with
 Christ. And if we consent, He will so identify Himself with our thoughts and
 aims, so blend our hearts and minds into conformity to His will, that when
 obeying Him we shall be but carrying out our own impulses. The will, refined
 and sanctified, will find its highest delight in doing his service. When we
 know God as it is our privilege to know Him, our life will be a life of continual
 obedience. Through an appreciation of the character of Christ, through com-
 munion with God, sin will become hateful to us."—The Desire of Ages,
 page 668.

                    Growing Up Into Christ

all things, which is the head, even Christ." Eph. 4:15.

           Spiritual Growth Begins With New Birth
   1. In what experience does an overcoming life begin? What is
our part in this transaction? 1 John 5:5.
   2. How necessary is this experience? What event is used to illus-
trate the beginning of spiritual life and growth? John 3:3-7.
   NoTE.—The new birth is one of the "musts" of the Bible. Spiritual life
is as impossible without a spiritual birth as physical life without a physical
birth. Life of all kinds must begin with birth.
  3. How only can we enter the family of God and become His
children? By whose will is the new birth possible? John 1:12, 13.
  4. By what instrument is the new birth accomplished? How is
the enduring nature of the word illustrated? How is the re-creative
word brought to man? 1 Peter 1:23-25.
   NoTE.—"The leaven hidden in the flour works invisibly to bring the whole
mass under its leavening process; so the leaven of truth works secretly,
silently, steadily, to transform the soul. The natural inclinations are softened
and subdued. New thoughts, new feelings, new motives, are implanted. A
new standard of character is set up,—the life of Christ. The mind is
changed; the faculties are roused to action in new lines."—Christ's Object
Lessons, pages 98, 99.
   5. What reformation will accompany the new creation? What
will be the attitude of the reborn toward the word? What will be
the result? 1 Peter 2:1, 2.
                 Illustrations of Spiritual Growth
   6. What illustrations of spiritual growth are taken from nature?
Hosea 14:5, 7; Luke 12:27, 28; Mark 4:26-29.
   7. How is the growth and fruitfulness of genuine Christians
again set forth? What will be their attitude toward the law of God?
Ps. 1:1-3.
   8. What glorious change is wrought by the gospel, or the "tid-
ings of great joy?" What are these transformed persons called? By
whom must these symbolic trees be planted in order to bear the
fruits of righteousness? Isa. 61:3.
    NOTE.—"The germination of the seed represents the beginning of spiritual
life, and the development of the plant is a beautiful figure of Christian growth.
As in nature, so in grace; there can be no life without growth. The plant must
either grow or die. As its growth is silent and imperceptible, but continuous,
so is the development of the Christian life. At every stage of development our
                                     [18]
life may be perfect; yet if God's purpose for us is fulfilled, there will be con-
tinual advancement. Sanctification is the work of a lifetime."—Christ's Object
Lessons, page 65.
    9. As Christians grow toward maturity, what change in spiritual
food becomes necessary? What therefore gives evidence of a lack
of spiritual growth? Heb. 5:12-14.
                      The Goal of Spiritual Growth
   10. Before His ascension, what gifts did Christ bestow upon His
church? What was the purpose of these spiritual gifts? Eph. 4:8,
11, 12.
    11. How long are these gifts of the Spirit to remain in the church?
What goal of Christian growth will eventually be attained by God's
remnant people? Verse 13; 1 Thess. 5:23.
    NOTE.—"Sanctification is not the work of a moment, an hour, a day, but
of a lifetime. It is not gained by a happy flight of feeling, but is the result
of constantly dying to sin and constantly living for Christ. Wrongs cannot be
righted nor reformations wrought in the character by feeble, intermittent
efforts. It is only by long, persevering effort, sore discipline, and stern conflict,
that we shall overcome. We know not one day-how strong will be our conflict
the next. So long as Satan reigns, we shall have self to subdue, besetting sins
to overcome; so long as life shall last, there will be no stopping place, no point
which we can reach and say, I have fully attained. Sanctification is the result
of lifelong obedience."—The Acts of the Apostles, pages 560, 561.
    12. How much is embraced in this growth into spiritual matur-
ity? Eph. 4: 14,15.
    NOTE.—"The child of God grows up to the full stature of a man or woman
in Christ. There is no limit to his improvement." "Pray that the mighty en-
ergies of the Holy Spirit, with all their quickening, recuperative, and trans-
forming power, may fall like an electric shock on the palsy-stricken soul,
causing every nerve to thrill with new life, restoring the whole man from his
 dead, earthly, sensual state to spiritual soundness."—Testimonies, vol. 5,
 pages 265, 267.
    13. As the result of the spiritual growth of its members, what
 will be the condition of the church as a whole? Verse 16.
     NOTE.—"All should consider that God's claims upon them are paramount to
 all others. God has given to every person capabilities to improve, that he may
 reflect glory to the Giver. Every day some progress should be made.... God
 designs that Christians shall grow continually,—grow up into the full stature
 of men and women in Christ. All who do not grow stronger, and become
 more firmly rooted and grounded in the truth, are continually retrograding."

                   Lesson 9, for September 1, 1945
                    The Work and the Life
   MEMORY VERSE: "In Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth anything,
nor uncircumcision ; but faith which worketh by love." Gal. 5:6.
   STUDY HELP: "Steps to Christ," chapter, "The Work and the Life."

                        The Source of Life
   1. What is the source of life, both physical and spiritual? What
was the purpose of Christ's advent? John 1:4; 5:40; 10:10.
   2. What is the purpose of the gospel? How • are the eternal
results of sin and righteousness contrasted? How only can eternal
life be obtained? Rom. 6:22, 23.
   3. How is life only in Christ again set forth? John 3:16; 1 John
5:11, 12.
   NOTE.—"Christ became one flesh with us, in order that we might become
one spirit with Him.... His life has become ours. Those who see Christ in His
true character, and receive Him into the heart, have everlasting life. It is
through the Spirit that Christ dwells in us; and the Spirit of God, received
into the heart by faith, is the beginning of the life eternal."—The Desire of
Ages, page 388.
                       The Evidence of Life
   4. By what means is the life and nature of a tree determined?
How does Jesus apply the lesson to spiritual life? Matt. 12:33, 34;,
7:20-23.
   5. What will happen to all spiritual trees not planted by the Lord,
and that do not bear fruit to' His glory? Matt. 15:13; Luke 13:6-9.
  6. What is the ultimate fate of a lifeless and fruitless branch?
What is the secret of life, growth, and fruit bearing? John 15:2-5.
  NOTE.—"Abiding in Christ means a constant receiving of His Spirit, a
life of unreserved surrender to His service. The channel of communication
must be open continually between man and his God. As the vine branch con-
stantly draws the sap from the living vine, so are we to cling to Jesus, and
receive from Him by faith the strength and perfection of His own character.
  . . The life of Christ in you produces the same fruits as in Him. Living in
Christ, adhering to Christ, supported by Christ, drawing nourishment from
Christ, you bear fruit after the similitude of Christ."—The Desire of Ages,
pages 676, 677.
                       Faith and Works
  7. How was living faith manifested by Noah and Abraham? Heb.
11:7, 8.
  8. With what words does James show the relationship of faith
and works? James 2:17-20.
  NOTE.—"A working church in travail for souls, will be a praying church,
a believing church, and a receiving church. A church whose members are
found upon their knees before God, supplicating His mercy, seeking Him daily,
                                   [ 20 ]
is a church that is feeding upon the bread of life, and drinking of the waters
of life."—Testimonies to Ministers, page 205.
   9. What is the ultimate purpose of making known the gospel to
all nations? Rom. 16:25, 26.
                               Love Works
   10. Through what agency is righteousness by faith possible?
What must be mingled with faith in order to produce good works?
Gal. 5:5, 6.
   NorE.—"No matter how high his profession, he whose heart is not imbued
with love for God and for his fellow men, is not a disciple of Christ. Though
he should possess great faith, and even have power to work miracles, yet
without love his faith would be worthless. He might display great liberality,
but should he from some other motive than genuine love, bestow all his
goods to feed the poor, the act would not commend him to the favor of God.
In his zeal he might even meet a martyr's death, yet if destitute of the gold
of love, he would be regarded by God as a deluded enthusiast or an ambitious
hypocrite."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 168.
   11. How is love for God demonstrated? How is the love of God
defined? John 14:15; 1 John 5:2, 3.
   NOTE.—"There are only two classes in the world today, and only two classes
will be recognized in the judgment,—those who violate God's law, and those
who obey it. Christ gives the test by which to prove our loyalty or dis-
loyalty. 'If ye love Me,' He says, 'keep My commandments. . .. He that bath
My commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth Me. And he
that loveth Me shall be loved of My Father, and I will love him, and will
manifest Myself to him. . . . He that loveth Me not keepeth not My sayings;
and the word which ye hear is not Mine, but the Father's which sent Me.' If
ye keep My commandments, ye shall abide in My love; even as I have kept
My Father's commandments, and abide in His love.'"—Christ's Object Les-
sons, page 283.
   12. How did Christ commend the good works of the church of
Ephesus? What rebuke did He minister? What appeal and warning
did He make? Rev. 2:2-5.
   NorE.—"He who loves Christ the most will do the greatest amount of good.
There is no limit to the usefulness of one who, by putting self aside, makes
room for the working of the Holy Spirit upon his heart, and lives a life
wholly consecrated to God."—The Desire of Ages, page 250.
   "One Christ-loving, devoted member, will do more good in a church than
one hundred half-converted, unsanctified, self-sufficient workers."—Testi-
monies, vol. 5,p. 114.
                     •
   13. What severe rebuke is given to God's remnant people for
 permitting their affection to become lukewarm? What threat is
 given? What remedy is suggested? Rev. 3:14-18.
   14. What does Christ declare His people to be? How does their
light become visible to others? Matt. 5:14, 16.
   15. Who deserves the credit and glory for all good works? Of
what may we therefore be confident? Phil. 2:13; 1:6.

                  Lesson 10, for September 8, 1945
                      A Knowledge of God
    MEMORY VERSE: "This is life eternal, that they might know Thee the only
true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou bast sent." John 17:3.
    STUDY HELP: "Steps to Christ," chapter, "A Knowledge of God."

                       The One True God
  1. What is said of the value of an idol? Of the number of false
gods? How is the true God described and identified? 1 Cor. 8:4-6.
   2. How is the Lord again contrasted with false gods? What mani-
festation of power identified Him as the only true God? How should
every human being therefore recognize Him? Ps. 95:3-6; 96:4, 5, 9.
  3. What is the only hope of eternal life? John 17:3.
   4. In what should men not boast? What wise counsel is given?
In what does the Lord find pleasure? Jer. 9:23, 24.
   NorE.—"The world has had its great teachers, men of giant intellect and
extensive research, men whose utterances have stimulated thought, and
opened to view vast fields of knowledge; and these men have been honored
as guides and benefactors of their race; but there is One who stands higher
than they. We can trace the line of the world's teachers as far back as human
records extend; but the Light was before them. As the moon and the stars
of our solar system shine by the reflected light of the sun, so, as far as their
teaching is true, do the world's great thinkers reflect the rays of the Sun of
Righteousness. Every gleam of thought, every flash of the intellect, is from
the Light of the world."—Education, pages 13, 14.
                   Revealed by Created Works
   5. With what is the earth full? Ps. 33:5.
   6. By what means is the glory of God revealed to all? How con-
stantly is God thus made known? How universally is this revela-
tion proclaimed? Ps. 19:1-4.
   7. On what grounds is the wrath of God revealed against false
worship? Rom. 1:18-25.
                  The Testimony of Scripture
   8. What did Jesus declare to be the purpose of the written word?
Why is this revelation necessary? How did the Jews demonstrate
their disbelief of the Old Testament Scriptures? John 5:39, 40,
46, 47.
   NOTE.—"The earth, marred and defiled by sin, reflects but dimly the Cre-
ator's glory. It is true that His object lessons are not obliterated. Upon
every page of the great volume of His created works may still be traced His
handwriting. Nature still speaks of her Creator. Yet these revelations 'are
partial and imperfect. And in our fallen state, with weakened powers and
restricted vision, we are incapable of interpreting aright. We need the fuller
revelation of Himself that God has given in His written word."—Education,
page 17.
                                     [ 22 3
  9. What severe rebuke did Jesus give His disciples? What did He
then do? Luke 24:25-27, 44, 45.
   NOTE.—"God speaks to us in His word. Here we have in clearer lines the
revelation of His character, of His dealings with men, and the great work of
redemption."—Steps to Christ, page 92.
   "The creative energy that called the worlds into existence is in the word
of God. This word imparts power ; it begets life. Every command is a promise ;
accepted by the will, received into the soul, it brings with it the life of the
Infinite One. It transforms the nature, and re-creates the soul in the image
of God."—Education, page 126.
   10. What did Jesus declare Himself to be? What are the two
results of eating the bread of life? How necessary is this spiritual
feeding? How did Jesus interpret His language? John 6:35, 51,
53, 54, 63.
   11. What are the Scriptures able to do? In whom is this salvation
found? 2 Tim. 3:15.
   12. What is the source of the Scriptures? For what four things
are they profitable? What is the final result of obedience to the in-
struction given? Verses 16, 17.
   13. What earnest appeal is made to God's remnant people? Who
only will pass victoriously through ..the final crisis? How is faith
defined and illustrated? Heb. 10:35-39; 11:1, 3.
    Nom—Faith is taking God at His word with no other evidence in sight.
It is dependence on the word of God. The centurion told Jesus to "speak the
word only, and my servant shall be healed." Jesus said to those who fol-
lowed Him: "I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel."



                 Lesson 11, for September 15, 1945
                    The Privilege of Prayer
   MEMORY VERSE: "Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for
another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man
availeth much." James 5:16.
   STUDY HELP: "Steps to Christ," chapter, "The Privilege of Prayer."

                Meaning and Purpose of Prayer
   1. How is prayer defined in the spirit of prophecy?
   ANSWER: —"Prayer is the opening of the heart to God as to a friend."—
Steps to Christ, page 97.
   2. How are our requests to be made known to God? What blessed
results are described? Phil. 4:6, 7.
   NOTE.—"It is when we come into difficult places that He reveals His
power and wisdom in answer to humble prayer. Have confidence in Him as a
prayer-hearing, prayer-answering God. He will reveal Himself to you as
                                  23
One who can help in every emergency. He who created man, who gave him
his wonderful physical, mental, and spiritual faculties, will not withhold that
which is necessary to sustain the life He has given."—The Ministry of Healing,
page 199.
   3. As the result of hearing Jesus commune with His Father,
what request did His disciples make? Luke 11:1.
   NorE.—God's people need to be taught how to pray, for "we know not
what we should pray for as we ought." But we also need to be taught to
pray, for prayer is one of the most neglected of all religious duties and privi-
leges. The following definitions of prayer emphasize its importance: "It
[prayer] is the soul of religion."—Testimonies, vol. 1, p. 163. "Prayer is the
most holy exercise of the soul."—Ibid., vol. 5, p. 201. Speaking of prayer
further, the spirit of prophecy gives the idea that prayer is a guard to the
heart, the citadel of the soul.
                              Public Prayer
   4. What two unworthy motives in prayer are condemned? Matt.
6:5, 7, 8.
   NOTE.—"The prayers offered in public should be short and to the point.
God does not require us to make the season of worship tedious by lengthy
petitions. Christ did not enforce upon His disciples wearisome ceremonies and
long prayers. 'When thou prayest,' He said, 'thou shalt not be as the hypo-
crites are: for they love to pray, standing in the synagogues and in the
corners of the. streets, that they may be seen of men.' "—Gospel Workers,
page 175.
   5. What sample prayer did Jesus give? Verses 9-13.
   NOTE.—"Christ impressed upon His disciples the idea that their prayers
should be short, expressing just what they wanted and no more. He gives
the length and substance of their prayers. ... How comprehensive this sample
prayer! . .. But many offer prayer in a dry, sermonizing manner. These pray
to men, not to God. . . . All such prayers are as sounding brass and a tinkling
cymbal. They are made no account of in heaven. Angels of God are wearied
with them, as well as mortals who are compelled to listen to them."—Testi-
monies, vol. 2, pp. 581, 582.
                               Secret Prayer
  6. What did Jesus say about the place and results' of secret
prayer? Verse 6.
   NOTE.—"Pray in your closet; and as you go about your daily labor, let
your heart be often uplifted to God. It was thus that Enoch walked with God.
These silent prayers rise like precious incense before the throne of grace.
Satan cannot overcome him whose heart is thus stayed upon God."—Steps to
Christ, page 103.
   7. While Jesus asked His most intimate associates to be near
Him during the Gethsemane struggle, how did He face the final
crisis? Matt. 26:36-40.
   NoTE.—While association in prayer is valuable and even necessary, it is in
secret that we open the intimacies of our hearts and lives to God "as to a
friend." Alone we must face and conquer the foe in the time ,of crisis.
                                  [24 ]
                  "Our crosses are hewn from different trees,
                   But we all must have our Calvaries.
                   We may climb the height from a different side,
                   But we each go up to be crucified.
                   As we scale the steep, another may share
                   The dreadful load that our shoulders bear:
                   But the costliest sorrow is all our own,
                   For on the summit we bleed alone."
                  Conditions of Effectual Prayer
   8. How important is faith in effectual prayer? How did the cen-
turion manifest his faith in the word? Heb. 11:6; Matt. 8:5-10.
   9. What is the relation between obedience and prayer? Prov.
28:9; 1 John 3:22; 5:14.
   10. What strong language is used to set forth the need of an un-
broken prayer habit? What illustration in the physical life em-
phasizes the necessity of living in the atmosphere of prayer? 1 Thess.
5:17; Lam. 3:55, 56.
   NOTE.—"Prayer is the breath of the soul. It is the secret of spiritual power.
No other means of grace can be substituted, and the health of the soul be pre-
served. Prayer brings the heart into immediate contact with the Wellspring
of life, and strengthens the sinew and muscle of the religious experience."—Gos-
pel Workers, pages 254, 255.
   11. By what parables did Jesus emphasize the importance of con-
tinual and persistent prayer? What definite promise do these illus-
trations emphasize? Luke 18:1-8; 11:5-10.
   12. On what conditions does prayer accomplish results? What
statement concerning Elijah gives courage to all who pray? What
experience of answered prayer is related? James 5:16-18.
   13. What counsel is given to God's remnant people? 1 Peter 4:7.


                 Lesson 12, for September 22, 1945
                    What to Do With Doubt
    MEMORY VERSE: "The wise men are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken:
lo, they have rejected the word of the Lord; and what wisdom is in them?" Jer. 8:9.
    STUDY HELP: "Steps to Christ," chapter, "What to Do With Doubt."
                   Warnings Against Doubt
  1. What is the will of God for all men? What three conditions
of answered prayer are given? 1 Tim. 2:8.
   2. From the Scriptural record, what made it possible for Peter
to walk on the water? What was the cause of his failure? With what
words did Jesus rebuke him? Matt. 14:28-31.
   NoTE.—"Looking unto Jesus, Peter walks securely ; but as in self-satisfaction
he glances back toward his companions in the boat, his eyes are turned from
the Saviour. The wind is boisterous. The waves roll high, and come directly
                                       [ 25 ]
between him and the Master; and he is afraid. For a moment Christ is hidden
from his view, and his faith gives way. He begins to sink. But while the
billows talk with death, Peter lifts his eyes from the angry waters, and fixing
them upon Jesus, cries, 'Lord, save me.' Immediately Jesus grasps the out-
stretched hand, saying, '0 thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?' "—
The Desire of Ages, page 381.
  3. What warning is given against unbelief? Where does doubt
have its source? What are the evil results? Heb. 3:12, 13.
   NoTE.—"The word of God, like the character of its Author, presents mys-
teries that can never be fully comprehended by finite beings. But God has
given in the Scriptures sufficient evidence of their divine authority. . . . True,
He has not removed the possibility of doubt; faith must rest upon evidence,
not demonstration; those who wish to doubt have opportunity; but those who
desire to know the truth find ample ground for faith."—Education, page 169.
                       Importance of Faith
  4. On what condition does God answer prayer? How fully are
the prayers of faith answered? Mark 11:22-24.
   NoTE.—"Often men are tempted to falter before the perplexities and ob-
stacles that confront them. But if they will hold the beginning of 'their
confidence steadfast unto the end, God will make the way clear. Success will
come to them as they struggle against difficulties. Before the intrepid spirit
and unwavering faith of a Zerubbabel, great mountains of difficulty will be-
come a plain."—Prophets and Kings, page 595.
   5. What promise is made to all who need enlightenment? How
is doubting described and illustrated? What appropriate term de-
scribes a doubter, and what is said of his character? James 1:5-8.
   6. What question did the disciples ask Jesus in regard to their
failure to heal the lunatic? How did Jesus answer? Matt. 17:19-21.
   NoTE.—"But many have not a living faith. This is why they do not see
more of the power of God. Their weakness is the result of their unbelief.
They have more faith in their own working than in the working of God for
them. They take themselves into their own keeping. They plan and devise,
but pray little, and have little real trust in God."---Christ's Object Lessons,
page 145.
                         Appeal to Reason
   7. What appeal does the Lord make to every sinner? In what
words is the reasonableness of God's requirements stated by Paul?
Isa. 1:18; Rom. 12:1.
   8. What indicates that some things cannot be understood by
man? To whom belongs the revelations of the Scriptures, and what
is the result of belief? How fully has God revealed the things
necessary to our welfare and salvation? Deut. 29:29; Amos 3:7.
   9. What statement of Jesus indicates the simplicity with which
truth is revealed? Matt. 11:25.
   NoTE.—"The Bible unfolds truth with a simplicity and an adaptation to
the needs and longings of the human heart that has astonished and charmed
the most highly cultivated minds, while to the humble and uncultured also
                                  [2s 1
it makes plain the way of life. 'The wayfaring men, though fools, shall not
err therein.' No child need mistake the path. Not one trembling seeker need
fail of walking in pure and holy light. Yet the most simply stated truths lay
hold upon themes elevated, far-reaching, infinitely beyond the power of human
comprehension,—mysteries that are the hiding of His glory,—mysteries that
overpower the mind in its research, while they inspire the sincere seeker for
truth with reverence and faith. The more we search the Bible, the deeper is
our conviction that it is the word of the living God, and human reason bows
before the majesty of divine revelation."—Education, page 170.
             Certainty of Inspired Truth Basis of Faith
    10. How sure are the revelations of God's prophets? To what
is prophecy likened? For what purpose does this light shine? How
were the prophecies given? 2 Peter 1:16-21.
    11. What is the basis of faith? Rom. 10:17.
    NorE.—"In your study of the word of God, penetrate deeper and still
deeper beneath the surface. Lay hold by faith on divine power, and sound the
depths of inspiration."—Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 151.
    12. What statement and illustration indicate the purity of the
word of God? By what divine promise is the preservation of the
Scriptures vouchsafed? Ps. 12:6, 7.
    13. What does the psalmist declare concerning the truth of God's
word? What is said of the perpetuity of the righteous judgments of
the Lord? Ps. 119:160.
    NOTE.—"The beginning of Thy word is true," is the marginal reading. This
is the portion of the Scriptures most often questioned by doubters. The Genesis
 record of creation has been the favorite battleground of skeptics. But the
 Bible stands or falls together. Jesus told the unbelieving Jews that if they be-
 lieved not the writings of Moses they would not believe His words. The loss
 of faith in one part of the Scriptures always leads to unbelief regarding divine
 inspiration and therefore doubts as to the reliability of the Bible as a whole.
    14. What did Peter say of the perpetuity of God's word? How
 did he contrast the enduring nature of the word of God with the
 transitory things of earth? 1 Peter 1:23-25.
    15. What will eventually be the feeling of all who remain will-
 ingly ignorant of the Scriptures? Jer. 8:9. See margin.
     16. Regardless of skepticism and apostasy, what is said of the
  Scriptural foundation of the Christian religion? 2 Tim. 2:19.
 -+
     "The principle laid down by Christ is that our offerings to God should be in
  proportion to the light and privileges enjoyed. 'Unto whomsoever much is
  given, of him shall be much required' Said the Saviour to His disciples, as He
  sent them forth, 'Freely ye have received, freely give' As our blessings and
  privileges are increased,—above all, as we have before us the unparalleled
  sacrifice of the glorious Son of God,—should not our gratitude find expression

               Lesson 13, for September 29, 1945
                     Rejoicing in the Lord
   MEMORY VERSE: "Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice."
Phil. 4:4.
   STUDY HELP : "Steps to Christ," chapter, "Rejoicing in the Lord."

                          Good Tidings
   1. How did the angel announce the birth of Christ to the shep-
herds? To how many is this great joy available? What is promised
to those who accept the good tidings? Luke 2:10, 11, 13, 14.
   NOTE.—The word "gospel" means "good news," or "good tidings." It is
"good tidings of great joy." The gospel is the sweetest story ever told. Good
news always brings joy to both the bearer and the receiver. Only happy people
can successfully preach the gospel. There is something wrong with the reli-
gious experience of a person who is morose and melancholy.
   2. To what prophecy did Jesus refer in setting forth the nature
of His work? What do the "good tidings" bring in place of mourn-
ing? Luke 4:16-18; Isa. 61:1-3.
   3. How is the world-embracing nature of the final message of
salvation illustrated? What term indicates the changeless nature of
the gospel? Rev. 14:6.
   4. What is the Christian admonished to do? How is the impor-
tance of this counsel emphasized? What admonition is given? What
special reason is given for rejoicing and moderation? Phil. 4:4, 5.
   NorE.—"Those professed Christians who are constantly whining and com-
plaining, and who seem to think happiness and a cheerful countenance a sin,
have not the genuine article of religion."—Testimonies, vol. 3, p. 34.
   "There is nothing gloomy in the religion of Jesus. If Christians give the
impression by a mournful attitude that they have been disappointed in their
Lord, they misrepresent His character, and put arguments into the mouth
of His enemies. Though in words they may claim God as their Father, yet in
gloom and sorrow they present to the world the aspect of orphans."—
Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, page 132.

                      Reasons for Rejoicing
   5. In what did Jesus tell His disciples to rejoice? For what reason
did Jesus rejoice? Luke 10:20, 21.
  6. What precious boon did Jesus leave with His followers? How
complete would be the joy of genuine Christians? John 14:27; 15:11.
  7. Where only may peace be found? What can Christians ex-
pect from this world? Why should we rejoice? John 16:33.
  NOTE.—"Happiness drawn from earthly sources is as changeable as varying
circumstances can make it; but the peace of Christ is a constant and abiding
peace. It does not depend upon any circumstances in life, on the amount of
worldly goods, or the number of earthly friends. Christ is the fountain of
living water, and happiness drawn from Him can never fail."—Thoughts
From the Mount of Blessing, page 32.
                                    28
   8. What is promised those who sow the precious seeds of truth?
How sure is the harvest, and in what spirit will the sheaves be
gathered? Ps. 126:5, 6.                                                      I less.
   9. What did Paul consider to be his crown of rejoicing? 1 Mtn. •
2:19, 20.
                            Secrets of Happiness
   10. What did Paul say he had not yet attained? While pressing
toward the prize, what difficult but necessary thing was he able
to do? Phil. 3:12-14.
    11. What is said of the ability of the redeemed to forget the
unpleasant things of this life? What conditions of happiness will
therefore prevail? Isa. 65:17-19. See margin of verse 17.
    NoTE.—In the supreme happiness of the new-earth state, the troubles of
this life will seem too worthless and insignificant to think about. Like the
apostle Paul they will "reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not
worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed." Rom. 8:18.
    "It is not wise to gather together all the unpleasant recollections, of a past
life,—its iniquities and disappointments,—to talk over them and mourn over
them until we are overwhelmed with discouragement. A discouraged soul is
filled with darkness, shutting out the light of God from his own soul, and cast-
ing a shadow upon the pathway of others."—Steps to Christ, page 122.
    12. What does the psalmist declare to be a cause for rejoicing?
Ps. 32:1, 2, 5, 10, 11.
                               A Day at a Time
    13. What is another important secret of avoiding anxiety? Matt.
6:34.
    Nom—Other translations read, "For tomorrow will bring its own cares,"
and "Every day has troubles enough of its own." "Take no thought" is better
translated "Be not anxious." Each day has enough troubles and problems to
keep us busy without stealing or borrowing from either the past or the future.
All God expects of us is that we meet the problems today as they come. To-
 morrow never arrives. We can never catch up with it. It is always a day
 ahead. How foolish then to try to live in it by borrowing its anticipated
 troubles. By this method we must meet the same troubles twice, once in
 anticipation and again when they become realities. You may break under the
 double load of tomorrow's troubles added to those of today. "Divide and
 conquer" applies with special force to troubles.
    14. How is the happy experience of God's children described?
 Isa. 26:3; 32:17, 18.
     NOTE. "Nothing of the world can make them sad when Jesus makes them
 glad by His presence. In perfect acquiescence there is perfect rest. . . . As
 through Jesus we enter into rest, heaven begins here. We respond to His
 invitation, Come, learn of Me, and in thus coming we begin the life eternal.
 Heaven is a ceaseless approaching to God through Christ. The longer we
 are in the heaven of bliss the more and still more of glory will be opened to
 us; and the more we know of God, the more intense will be our happiness.
 As we walk with Jesus in this life, we may be filled with His love, satisfied with
 His presence. All that human nature can bear, we may receive here."—The
 Desire of Ages, page 331.

           DAILY FOOD FOR DAILY STRENGTH

DAILY   food for our spiritual needs is even more important than daily food
  for our physical needs. We are taught to pray, "Give us this day our daily
bread," and too often we interpret this petition as relating to our food for
bodily nourishment. But the prayer includes far more than sustenance for our
physical strength.

   "The prayer for daily bread includes not only food to sustain the body; but
that spiritual bread which will nourish the soul unto life everlasting. . . . Our
Saviour is the bread of life, and it is by beholding His love, by receiving it
into the soul, that we feed upon the bread which came down from heaven.
   "We receive Christ through His word; and the Holy Spirit is given to open
the word of God to our understanding, and bring home its truths to our
hearts. We are to pray day by day that as we read His word, God will send
His Spirit to reveal to us the truth that will strengthen our souls for the day's
need."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, pages 164, 165.

   Daily, systematic Bible study arms the Christian to meet daily temptations.
There is no better method for daily Bible study than the study of the Sabbath
school lesson. "Temptations often appear irresistible because, through neglect
of prayer and the study of the Bible, the tempted one cannot readily remember
God's promises and meet Satan with the Scripture weapons."—Counsels on
Sabbath School Work, page 39.

             THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
                      September 29
                    SOUTHERN ASIA DIVISION
    India, with its vast population and multiplied castes! India, with its
Hinduism and Mohammedanism, its sacred bulls and its childwives ! India,
with its endless opportunity for evangelization, calls again for our sacrificial
liberality in the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering, September 29. The "overflow"
from this offering is to provide simple meetinghouses of worship and cottages
for native workers. Faithful workers have had to live under almost intolerable
conditions, and our work has been hindered because of lack of meetingplaces.
A new day has come to our work in this "Gibraltar of heathenism," and we
must provide the necessary facilities to care for the great harvest that is yet
to be reaped.
    The goal for the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering is $225,000. If this goal is
reached, it will ensure an overflow of $35,000 to meet at least a part of this
need in India. The latest overflow offering to Southern Asia, given in 1943,
amounted to $24,567.51. Not only was this generous offering heartily appre-
ciated by our brethren in that fruitful field of missionary endeavor, but it
also brought great courage to their hearts and blessing to their evangelistic
program. What great joy will well up in their hearts if we can furnish every
dollar of this $35,000 overflow offering goal I Let us plan, early for a generous
gift on Sabbaths September 29.
