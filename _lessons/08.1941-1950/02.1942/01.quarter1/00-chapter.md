            This Individual Sabbath School Offering Goal chart
         will appear in each Quarterly. Systematic giving week by
         week is becoming more and more a practice, and this
         chart is inserted by request. Many Sabbath school mem-
         bers are giving a dollar or more each week, and this goal
         chart will enable them to keep an accurate record of their
         covenant with God.

            "God has devised a plan by which all may give as He
         has prospered them, and which will make giving a habit
         without waiting for special calls. Those who can do this,
         but will not because of their selfishness, are robbing their
         Creator, who has bestowed upon them means to invest in
         His cause to advance its interests."—Testimonies, vol. 3,
         p. 411.

                OUR LORD SHALL COME

                     Lesson 1, for January 3, 1942
               God's Plan for Man's Salvation
   MEMORY VERSE: "I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between
thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel." Gen.
3:15.
   STUDY HELP: "Steps to Christ," pages 9-18.

                       Man's Fall From Perfection
   1. What was man's condition when created? Gen. 1:27, 31.
   2. What was his spiritual condition or character? Ecci. 7:29, first part.
   NoTE.—"Man was to bear God's image, both in outward resemblance
and in character. Christ alone is 'the express image' of the Father; but man
was formed in the likeness of God. His nature was in harmony with the will
of God. His mind was capable of comprehending divine things. His affections
were pure; his appetites and passions were under the control of reason. He
was holy and happy in bearing the image of God, and in perfect obedience to
His will."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 45.
    3. With what did God entrust man? Gen. 1:28; 2:8, 9, 15, 16.
    4. What only was withheld from man? Verse 17.
    5. When temptation came, how did Adam and Eve react? Gen. 3:1-6.

                    The Aftermath of Transgression
    6. What details are given regarding the first temptation and the fall of
man? Gen. 3:7, 8.
    NOTE.—God communed with Adam in his sinless state face to face. When
Adam yielded to the temptation placed before him by his companion, he at
first felt the thrill of the new experience, but all too soon for the comfort of
his soul he came to realize the necessity of meeting his Creator. Both he and
Eve saw "that they were naked." No longer did the garment of God's glory
clothe them. They sought material with which to cover themselves, and found
it hastily in the leaves of the fig tree. It was then they heard "the voice of
the Lord God walking in the garden," and they "hid themselves." No mere
fig leaves could cover the confusion of their souls. How bitterly now they
contemplated the choice they had made I
     7. In what way did God call them to account? Gen. 3:9-13.
    8. What curse was pronounced upon the serpent for its part in man's
fall? Verse 14.
    NOTE.—"Since it had been employed as Satan's medium, the serpent was to
                                        [3 ]
share the visitation of divine judgment. From the most beautiful and admired
of the creatures of the field, it was to become the most groveling and detested
of them all, feared and hated by both man and beast."—Patriarchs and Proph-
ets, page 58.
    9. In what words did God foretell the future lot of the disobedient?
Verses 16-19.
    10. How did God provide for man's clothing? Verse 21.
    NOTE.—It is not strange that God made for Adam and Eve coats of skins.
Sin brought death not only to Adam, but to those creatures over whom they
had been given dominion. Facing the sentence, "In the day that thou eatest
thereof thou shalt surely die" (margin, "dying thou shalt die"), the skins that
they wore were to them a constant reminder that they must suffer death as
did the animals whose skins they wore ; a constant reminder also that to redeem
them One must come from heaven to be bruised of Satan, to die that they
might live. (See Patriarchs and Prophets, pages 63-70.)
    11. What provision was made that sin should not be perpetuated for-
ever? Verses 22-24.
    12. What is the result of sin? Rom. 5:12; 1 Cor. 15:22.
                     Hope for the Transgressors
    13. What ray of hope was given Adam and Eve? Gen. 3:15.
    No'rE.—"As the guilty pair listened to these words, they were inspired with
hope; for in the prophecy concerning the breaking of Satan's power they dis-
cerned a promise of deliverance from the ruin wrought through trangression.
Though they must suffer from the power of their adversary because they had
fallen under his seductive influence and had chosen to disobey the plain com-
mand of Jehovah, yet they need not yield to utter despair. The Son of God was
offering to atone with His own lifeblood for their transgression. To them was
to be granted a period of probation, during which, through faith in the power
of Christ to save, they might become once more the children of God."—
Prophets and Kings, pages 681, 682.
    14. Through whom is freedom from the curse of sin provided? Matt.
1:21.
    15. What is the relation of man's will, or power of choice, to his eternal
destiny? Deut. 30:19; Joshua 24:15; Rev. 22:17.
    16. How is the truth taught that Christ alone can save the sinner?
Acts 4:12; 1 Tim. 2:5, 6.
    NoTE.—"Nothing but the righteousness of Christ can entitle us to one of
the blessings of the covenant of grace. There are many who have long desired
and tried to obtain these blessings, but have not received them, because they
have cherished the idea that they could do something to make themselves
worthy of them. They have not looked away from self, believing that Jesus
is an all-sufficient Saviour. We must not think that our own merits will save
us; Christ is our only hope of salvation. 'For there is none other name under
heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.' "—Patriarchs and
Prophets, page 431.
    17. If we fully accept Christ as our Saviour, how complete will be the
cleansing? 1 John 1:7-9.
                                      [4]
                    Lesson 2, for January 10, 1942
                 Promises of the Coming One
    MEMORY VERSE: "Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He
saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ."
Gal. 3:16.
    STUDY HELP: "The Return of Jesus," C. B. Haynes, pages 19-24.
                         The Promised Seed
    1. In what words was the promised Saviour first announced? Gen. 3:15.
    NOTE.—"To man the first intimation of redemption was communicated in
the sentence pronounced upon Satan in the garden. The Lord declared, 'I will
put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed;
it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.' This sentence, uttered
in the hearing of our first parents, was to them a promise. While it foretold
war between man and Satan, it declared that the power of the great adversary
would finally be broken."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pages 65, 66.
     2. To whom was this same promise later definitely renewed? Gen.
17:4-8; 22:18.
    NOTE.—"This same covenant was renewed to Abraham in the promise,
`In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.' "—Patriarchs and
Prophets, page 370.
     3. Who is the seed here referred to? Gal. 3:16.
     NOTE.—"This promise pointed to Christ. So Abraham understood it,
and he trusted in Christ for the forgiveness of sins. It was this faith that was
accounted unto him for righteousness."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 370.
                     Other Names and Appellations
  4. Through Moses, what promise of leadership was given to Israel?
Deut. 18 : 15 ; Acts 3:22-24.
   5. How is the Leader of Israel spoken of in Exodus 23:20?
   6. What term is used concerning Him in the New Testament? 1 Cor.
10:4.
    7. How does the psalmist speak of the Coming One? Ps. 2:6, 7.
   NoTE.—The psalmist speaks very directly in this passage concerning the
establishment of the king upon Zion, the holy hill. That the reference is to
Christ, the promised seed, is evident from verse 7, in the words, "Thou art
My Son; this day have I begotten Thee." John speaks of Christ as God's
"only-begotten Son" who was sent into the world "that we might live through
Him."
                            Isaiah's Vivid Picture
   8. With what questions does Isaiah introduce his prophecy of the
Saviour's life and death? Isa. 53:1.
   9. How does he describe His physical appearance? Verse 2.
   10. What was to be man's attitude toward Him? With what results?
 Verse 3.
                                 [51
    11. What was He to bear for us? Why was this necessary? Verses 4-6.
   NoTE.—"As a member of the human family He [Christ] was mortal, as
God He was the fountain of life for the world. He could have withstood the
advances of death, and refused to come under its dominion; but voluntarily
He laid down His life, that He might bring life and immortality to light. He
bore the sin of the world, endured its curse, yielded up. His life as a sacrifice,
that men might not eternally die."—The Desire of Ages, pages 483, 484.
    12. How are His trial and condemnation described? Verses 7, 8.
    NoTE.—Of the Saviour it is written that "as a sheep before her shearers
is dumb, so He openeth not His mouth." In The Desire of Ages, page 706,
we are told that He "held His peace" in the face of false accusers. But when
the high priest adjured Him by the living God, He replied, "Thou hast said."
    "To this appeal Christ could not remain silent. There was a time to be
silent, and a time to speak. He had not spoken until directly questioned. He
knew that to answer now would make His death certain. But the appeal was
made by the highest acknowledged authority of the nation, and in the name
of the Most High. Christ would not fail to show proper respect for the law.
More than this, His own relation to the Father was called in question. He
must plainly declare His character and mission. Jesus had said to His dis-
ciples, 'Whosoever therefore shall confess Me before men, him will I confess
also before My Father which is in heaven.' Now by His own example He re-
peated the lesson."—The Desire of Ages, pages 706, 707.
    13. With whom was He to make His grave? Verse 9.
    14. What was to be the reward of all His suffering and sacrifice? Verses
10-12.
    NorE.—"The Saviour longs to manifest His grace and stamp His charac-
ter on the whole world. It is His purchased possession, and He desires to make
men free, and pure, and holy. Though Satan works to hinder this purpose, yet
through the blood shed for the world there are triumphs to be achieved that
will bring glory to God and the Lamb. Christ will not be satisfied till the
victory is complete, and 'He shall see of the travail of His soul, and shall be
satisfied.' All the nations of the earth shall hear the gospel of His grace. Not
all will receive His grace; but 'a seed shall serve Him; it shall be accounted
to the Lord for a generation.' "—The Desire of Ages, pages 827, 828.



                     Lesson 3, for January 17, 1942
                    Prophecies of the Messiah
    MEMORY VERSE: "But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among

in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting." Micah 5:2.
    STUDY HELPS: "The Desire of Ages," pages 236-239, 745-749; "Prophets and
Kings," pages 269-275.                                                            •
                              His Birth Foretold
   1. What sign of the birth of Christ was given by Isaiah? Isa. 7:14.
(Fulfillment: Matt. 1:22, 23.)
                                         [6 7
    2. In what place was the Saviour to be born? Micah 5:2. (Fulfillment:
Matt. 2:1.)
   3. In what prophetic words did Balaam describe Him? Num. 24:17.
(Application: Matt. 2:2.)
   NOTE.—"He [Moses] was permitted to look down the stream of time, and
behold the first advent of our Saviour. He saw Jesus as a babe in Bethlehem.
He heard the voices of the angelic host break forth in the glad song of praise
to God and peace on earth. He beheld in the heavens the star guiding the
wise men of the East to Jesus, and a great light flooded his mind as he re-
called those prophetic words, 'There shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a
Scepter shall rise out of Israel.'"—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 475.
    4. 'What language of Jeremiah's is used to describe the effort to destroy
the infant Jesus? Jer. 31:15. (Fulfillment: Matt. 2:16-18.)
                Preparation for His Public Ministry
    5. Where is John's preparatory ministry foretold? Isa. 40:3. (Ful-
fillment: John 1:19-23.)
    6. 'What characteristics of Christ's ministry are given by Isaiah? Isa.
61:1-3. (Fulfillment: Luke 4:16-21.)
    NOTE.—"Jesus stood before the people as, a living expositor of the prophe-
cies concerning Himself. Explaining the words He had read, He spoke of the
Messiah as a reliever of the oppressed, a liberator of captives, a healer of the
afflicted, restoring sight to the blind, and revealing to the world the light of
truth. His impressive manner and the wonderful import of His words thrilled
the hearers with a power they had never felt before. The tide of divine in-
fluence broke every barrier down; like Moses, they beheld the Invisible. As
their hearts were moved upon by the Holy Spirit, they responded with fervent
amens, and praises to the Lord."—The Desire of Ages, page 237.
    7. How was Christ's triumphant entry into Jerusalem foretold? Zech.
9:9. (Fulfillment: Luke 19:28-40.)

           Predictions Concerning His Trial and Death
    8. How was Christ's silence during His trial foretold? Isa. 53:7. (Ful-
fillment: Matt. 27:13, 14.)
    9. In what words does the psalmist foretell the parting of Christ's
garments? Ps. 22:18. (Fulfillment: Matt. 27:35.)
    10. What prophecy foretold His experience on the cross? Ps. 69:21.
 (Fulfillment: Matt. 27:34.)
    NOTE.—"In the sufferings of Christ upon the cross, prophecy was fulfilled.
Centuries before the crucifixion, the Saviour had foretold the treatment He
was to receive. He said, 'Dogs have compassed Me: the assembly of the
wicked have enclosed Me; they pierced My hands and My feet. I may tell
all My bones; they look and stare upon Me. They part My garments among
them, and cast lots upon My vesture.' The prophecy concerning His garments
 was carried out without counsel or interference from the friends or the enemies
 of the Crucified One. To the soldiers who had placed Him upon the cross,
 His clothing was given. Christ heard the men's contention as they parted the
                                        7
garments among them. His tunic was woven throughout without seam, and
 they said, let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be.'
    "In another prophecy the Saviour declared, 'Reproach hath broken My
heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked for some to take pity, but there
was none; and for comforters, but I found none. They gave Me also gall for
My meat; and in My thirst they gave Me vinegar to drink.' To those who suf-
fered death by the cross, it was permitted to give a stupefying potion, to
deaden the sense of pain. This was offered to Jesus; but when He had tasted
it, He refused it. He would receive nothing that could becloud His mind. His
faith must keep fast hold upon God. This was His only strength. To becloud
His senses would give Satan an advantage."—The Desire of Ages, pages
745, 746.
    11. What details of the burial of Christ were foretold? Isa. 53:9. (Ful-
fillment: Matt. 27:38, 57-60.)
    12. Of what was the experience of Jonah made a sign? Matt. 12:39,
40. (See Jonah 1:17.)
    NOTE.-" 'He [Jesus] sighed deeply in His spirit, and saith, Why doth this
generation seek after a sign?"There shall no sign be given unto it, but the
sign of the prophet Jonas.' As Jonah was three days and three nights in the
belly of the whale, Christ was to be the same time 'in the heart of the earth.'
And as the preaching of Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so Christ's preach-
ing was a sign to His generation.;'—The Desire of Ages, page 406.
    "Christ, during His earthly ministry, referred to the good wrought by the
preaching of Jonah in Nineveh, and compared the inhabitants of that heathen
center with the professed people of God in His day. 'The men of Nineveh,' He
declared, 'shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it:
because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than
Jonas is here.' Into the busy world, filled with the din of commerce and the
altercation of trade, where men were trying to get all they could for self,
Christ had come; and above the confusion, His voice, like the trump of God,
was heard: 'What shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and
lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?'
    "As the preaching of Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so Christ's preach-
ing was a sign to His generation. But what a contrast in the reception of the
word! Yet in the face of indifference and scorn, the Saviour labored on and
on, until He had accomplished His mission."—Prophets and Kings, pages
273, 274.
    13. How does the psalmist speak of Christ's triumph over death? Ps.
16:10. (Application: Acts 2:24-27.)

                  Is Not This He?
   Israel's Reactions to Christ's First Appearing
   MEMORY VERSE: "She saith unto Him, Yea, Lord: I believe that Thou art the
Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world." John 11:27.
   STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pages 43-49, 59-67, 719-722.

                       At the Time of His Birth
    1. To whom, and how, was the birth of Christ first announced? Luke
2:8-12.
  NOTE.—"In the fields where the boy David had led his flock, shepherds
were still keeping watch by night. Through the silent hours they talked to-
gether of the promised Saviour, and prayed for the coming of the King to
David's throne. 'And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the
glory of the Lord shone round about them • and they were sore afraid. And
the angel said unto them, Fear not; for, behold, I bring you good tidings of
great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the
city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.'
    "At these words, visions of glory fill the minds of the listening shepherds.
The Deliverer has come to Israel ! Power, exaltation, triumph, are associated
with His coming. But the angel must prepare them to recognize their Saviour
in poverty and humiliation. 'This shall be a sign unto you,' he says; 'ye shall
find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.'
    "The heavenly messenger had quieted their fears. He had told them how
to find Jesus. With tender regard for their human weakness, he had given
them time to become accustomed to the divine radiance. Then the joy and
glory could no longer be hidden. The whole plain was lighted up with the
bright shining of the hosts of God."—The Desire of Ages, page 47.
    2. How did the angelic host welcome Christ's appearing? Verses 10,
13, 14.
    3. What two aged saints awaited His advent? Luke 2:25-38.
    4. Who are recorded as waiting with eager longing for the appearance
of the Messiah? Matt. 2:1, 2, 10.
    5. What was the attitude of Herod the king and of the priests when
approached by the wise men? Matt. 2:3-9.
    NoTE.—"The priests and elders of Jerusalem were not as ignorant con-
cerning the birth of Christ as they pretended. The report of the angels' visit
to the shepherds had been brought to Jerusalem, but the rabbis had treated
it as unworthy of their notice. They themselves might have found Jesus, and
might have been ready to lead the magi to His birthplace; but instead of
this, the wise men came to call their attention to the birth of the Messiah.
`Where is He that is born King of the Jews?' they said; 'for we have seen
His.star in the East, and are come to worship Him.'
    "Now pride and envy closed the door against the light. If the reports
brought by the shepherds and the wise men were credited, they would place
the priests and rabbis in a most unenviable position, disproving their claim
                                     [91
to be the exponents of the truth of God. These learned teachers would not
stoop to be instructed by those whom they termed heathen. It could,not be,
they said, that God had passed them by, to communicate with ignorant shep-
herds or uncircumcised Gentiles. They determined to show their contempt
for the reports that were exciting King Herod and all Jerusalem. They would
not even go to Bethlehem to see whether these things were so. And they led
the people to regard the interest in Jesus as a fanatical excitement."—The
Desire of Ages, pages 62, 63.
   6. Owing to Herod's plot to slay Him, what were Christ's parents
warned to do? How did Herod still seek to carry out his plan? Matt.
2:11-18.
                         During His Childhood
     7. While visiting Jerusalem with His parents, with whom was Jesus
brought into contact? With what results? Luke 2:46, 47.
     8. How did the parents of Jesus relate themselves to statements re-
garding His mission? Verses 48-51, 19.
     No'rE.—"The life of Christ was marked with respect and love for His
mother. Mary believed in her heart that the holy child born of her was the
long-promised Messiah, yet she dared not express her faith. Throughout His
life on earth she was a partaker in His sufferings. She witnessed with sorrow
the trials brought upon Him in His childhood and youth. By her vindication
of what she knew to be right in His conduct, she herself was brought into try-
ing positions. She looked upon the associations of the home, and the mother's
tender watchcare over her children, as of vital importance in the formation
of character. . . .
    "At times she wavered between Jesus and His brothers, who did not be-
lieve that He was the Sent of God; but evidence was abundant that His was
a divine character. She saw Him sacrificing Himself for the good of others.
His presence brought a purer atmosphere into the home, and His life was as
leaven working amid the elements of society."—The Desire of Ages, pages
90, 91.
     9. How was Jesus regarded in His home city of Nazareth? John 1:9-11;
Matt. 13:53-58.
     NOTE.—"The people of Nazareth did not believe on Him. For this reason,
Jesus did not visit Nazareth on His way to Cana. The Saviour declared to His
disciples that a prophet has no honor in his own country. Men estimate char-
acter by that which they themselves are capable of appreciating. The narrow
and wordly-minded judged of Christ by His humble birth, His lowly garb, and
daily toil. They could not appreciate the purity of that spirit upon which
was no stain of sin."—The Desire of Ages, page 196.
    •"The leaders of the people were offended, 'and they said, Is not this Jesus,
the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How is it then that He
saith, I came down from heaven?' They tried to arouse prejudice by referring
scornfully to the lowly origin of Jesus. They contemptuously alluded to His
life as a Galilean laborer, and to His family as being poor and lowly. The
claims of this uneducated carpenter, they said, were unworthy of their atten-
 tion. And on account of His mysterious birth they insinuated that He was of
doubtful parentage, thus representing the human circumstances of His birth
as a blot upon His history."—The Desire of Ages, page 387.

               In the Years of His Earthly Ministry
   10. How did Jesus Himself speak of His rejection by the Jewish
leaders? Matt. 21:42-46. (See also John 8:22-24, 40-45.)
   11. How did the Pharisees attribute His power to cast out devils?
Matt. 9:34.
   12. To what length did they go in opposition to Him? Mark 14:1;
Matt. 12:14-21.
   13. How did they seek to charge Him with blasphemy? Luke 5:18-21.
    14. Give some instances of faith in and acceptance of Jesus as the
Messiah. John 9:36-38; 11:27; 17:12; Acts 1:15.
    NorE.—Those whose hearts were open to the ministry of the Holy Spirit,
whose preconceived opinions did not stand between them and belief in the
mission and ministry of Jesus, not only accepted Him as the Messiah, but
held firmly to that belief in His divine mission. In the scriptures referred to,
mention is made of the blind man who was healed, of Martha's confident
faith, of all but Judas among His disciples who continued with Him, and of
the hundred and twenty who waited in the upper room for the outpouring
of the Spirit. Undoubtedly there were many others whose lives had been
uplifted by His ministry of love who, with these, rested their hope in Jesus
as the promised Messiah. Such were ready for the wider ministry of the apos-
tles after His resurrection and ascension, and were among those who, baptized
by the Holy Spirit, entered the ranks of the early church as believers.
                   In His Death and Resurrection
    15. Who accompanied Christ into the Garden of Gethsemane? Matt.
26 : 36-46.
    16. At His trial, what was the attitude of one of His foremost disci-
ples? Verses 57, 58, 69-75.
    17. How far did another go in betrayal of Him? Verses 47-55.
    NOTE.—"Judas was not yet wholly hardened. Even after he had twice
pledged himself to betray the Saviour, there was opportunity for repentance.
At the Passover supper Jesus proved His divinity by revealing the traitor's
purpose. He tenderly included Judas in the ministry to the disciples. But the
last appeal of love was unheeded. Then the case of Judas was decided, and the
feet that Jesus had washed, went forth to the betrayer's work."—The Desire
of Ages, page 720.
    18. By what indignities were His last hours among the Jewish people
marred? Matt. 26:67, 68; 27:26-31, 39-44.
    NorE.—The Son of God, Jesus of Nazareth, betrayed, forsaken of His own,
in His hour of trial and suffering, stood condemned unjustly by the councils
of a nation professedly children of the Most High. In those moments of soul-
suffering, He was spit upon by the rough guardians of the law, unrebuked
by the highest ecclesiastical authorities of the nation. They smote Him in the
face, calling for Him, the majesty of heaven, to tell who had smitten Him.
Later in Pilate's judgment hall, these false leaders of a people whom they had
led into rejection of the Messiah, cried, "His blood be on us, and on our chil-
dren." Released by Pilate to be crucified, He was stripped and robed in a
                                        11
scarlet robe, crowned with thorns and with a reed for a scepter, again treated
with cruel indignities by the rough Roman soldiery. Crucified, hanging be-
tween two thieves, His garments parted among those who had nailed Him to
the cross, the very men who should have welcomed Him as their Lord and
Saviour, descended to the lowest depths of depravity, and railed at Him say-
ing, "He saved others; Himself He cannot save." Yet some loved Him both
in life and in death. These were the leaven which would some day leaven the
whole lump ; from their faith and lives of sacrifice have been built the true
Israel of whom Christ is both king and Saviour.



                    Lesson 5, for January 31, 1942

                     "My Lord and My God"
 Recognition of Christ's Mission by His Disciples
    MEMORY VERSE: "Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen Me,
thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed." John
20:29.
    STUDY HELPS: "The Desire of Ages," pages 426-431, 807, 808; "Christ's Ob-
ject Lessons," pages 152-156 (new ed., pages 155-157).

                            The Call to Service
    1. Give the circumstances of Christ's call to His first disciples. Matt.
4:18-22.
    NorE.—When Jesus called the apostles into His service, they answered
without question. Leaving all, they followed Him. But their minds were
to a large extent filled with the traditions of their fathers, their ideals pat-
terned after the teachings of the leaders of Israel, who later refused to accept
Christ as the Messiah, and rejected and slew Him. Yet day by day under
His patient ministry and His teaching the spiritual vision of the disciples be-
came clearer. Three and a half years under His guidance made new men of •
them—men of faith, of zeal, of unselfishness. However, not till after His
death and resurrection and the descent of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost were
their lives so fully transformed that they were always willing to follow the
Spirit's guidance.
    2. When first sent out in service, what instruction was given the apos-
tles? Matt. 10:1-15.
    3. What evidences have we that they did not always comprehend His
messages or His mission? Matt. 16:6-12, 21-23.
     4. How was the lack of faith on the part of the disciples once demon-
strated? Matt. 17:14-21.
    NOTE.—"The nine disciples were yet pondering upon the bitter• fact of
their own failure; and when Jesus was once more-alone with them, they ques-
tioned, 'Why could not we cast him out?' Jesus answered them, 'Because of
your unbelief; for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mus-
tard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place, and
it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you. Howbeit this kind
                                        12
goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.' Their unbelief, that shut them out
from deeper sympathy with Christ, and the carelessness with which they re-
garded the sacred work committed to them, had caused their failure in the
conflict with the powers of darkness."—The Desire 'of Ages, page 430.
                       In Search of Preferment
    5. What request came to Jesus in behalf of two of His disciples? How
did He reply? What principle of His kingdom did He set forth? Matt.
20:20-28.
    NOTE.—"Jesus bears tenderly with them, not rebuking their selfishness in
seeking preference above their brethren. He reads their hearts, He knows the
depth of their attachment to Him. Their love is not a mere human affection;
though defiled by the earthliness of its human channel, it is an outflowing
from the fountain of His own redeeming love. He will not rebuke, but deepen
and purify."—The Desire of Ages, page 548.
    6. How did the Lord express the purpose of His own life? Mark 10:45.
    7. To impress His disciples with their great need in preparation for
service, what example of this principle did He set them? John 13:1-17.
    NOTE.—"Among His disciples Christ was in every sense a caretaker, a
burden bearer. He shared their poverty, He •practiced self-denial on their
account, He went before them to smooth the more difficult places, and soon
He would consummate His work on earth by laying down His life. The
principle on which Christ acted is to actuate the members of the church
which is His body. The plan and ground of salvation is love. In the king-
dom of Christ those are greatest who follow the example He has given, and
act as shepherds of His flock."—The Desire of Ages, page 550.
                      Tried and Found Wanting
    8. After his betrayal of the Master, how did Peter manifest his deep
remorse? Luke 22:61, 62.
    9. What did most of the disciples do on the night of Christ's betrayal?
Mark 14:50.
   NOTE.—"The disciples were terrified as they saw Jesus permit Himself to
be taken and bound. They were offended that He should suffer this humilia-
tion to Himself and them. They could not understand His conduct, and they
blamed Him for submitting to the mob. In their indignation and fear, Peter
proposed that they save themselves. Following this suggestion, 'they all for-
sook Him, and fled.' But Christ had foretold this desertion. 'Behold,' He
had said, 'the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every
man to his own, and shall leave Me alone ; and yet I am not alone, because
the Father is with Me.' "—The Desire of Ages, page 697.
   The disciple of today is prone to condemn the early disciples for their
desertion of the Master in His hour of agony. It would be well for us rather to
watch and pray lest we, too, enter into temptation, and in the hour of trial flee

 from apparent or real danger. The words of the poet give every Christian food
 for serious thought:
                    "With frightened lips, I shall not ever say,
                     'I know Him not,' for none will ever question me.
                      I shall not need to speak a word today
                      To publish to the world my loyalty.
                      And yet a hundred times there comes a voice,
                     'Know you this man,—the Master?' and behold,
                      A hundred times I make the fateful choice
                      Today, as the apostle once of old.
                      And every unkind word or straying thought,
                      Every deed of hatred or disdain,
                      Says plainly to the world, 'I know Him not.'
                      And then the cock crows—bitter morn of pain.
                      And would indeed today that they might be—
                      The times I have denied Him—only three."

           •    The Needed Preparation for Service
    10. What experience did the Saviour intimate Peter needed that he
might strengthen his brethren? Luke 22:31, 32.
    11. What testing questions did the Saviour subsequently put to Peter?
John 21:15-19.
   NOTE.—"A work broader and more delicate than had heretofore been his
was appointed him. Christ bade him feed the sheep and the lambs. In thus
committing to his stewardship the souls for whom the Saviour had laid down
His own life, Christ gave to Peter the strongest proof of confidence in his
restoration. The once restless, boastful, self-confident disciple had become
subdued and contrite. Henceforth he followed his Lord in self-denial and self-
sacrifice. He was a partaker of Christ's sufferings; and when Christ shall sit
upon the throne of His glory, Peter will be a partaker in His glory."—Christ's
Object Lessons, page 154.
  12. How did Christ remind Peter that his own personal relationship to
God should have first consideration? Verses 20-22.

                       Believing Unto Salvation
   13. What self-confident attitude had Peter taken before his conversion?
John 13:37.
   14. Tested in his later experience, how did he stand? Acts 4:20; 5:29.
    15. What attribute of character was urged by John, and exemplified in
his later life? 1 John A: 7.
    NOTE.—"John did rot naturally possess the loveliness of character that
his later experience revealed. By nature he had serious defects. He was not
only proud, self-assertive, and ambitious for honor, but impetuous, and re-
sentful under injury. He and his brother were called 'sons of thunder.' Evil
temper, the desire for revenge, the spirit of criticism, were all in the beloved
disciple. But beneath all this the divine Teacher discerned the ardent, sin-
cere, loving heart. Jesus rebuked his self-seeking, disappointed his ambitions,
tested his faith. But He revealed to him that for which his soul longed,—the
                                     [ 14 1
beauty of holiness, the transforming power of love."—The Acts of the Apos-
tles, page 540.
    16. In what striking words did doubting Thomas acknowledge his
recognition of Christ? John 20:24, 25, 28.
    Nora.—"Turning to Thomas He said, 'Reach hither thy finger, and behold
My hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into My side; and be not
faithless, but believing.' These words showed that He was acquainted with
the thoughts and words of Thomas. The doubting disciple knew that none
of his companions had seen Jesus for a week. They could not have told the
Master of his unbelief. He recognized the One before him as his Lord. He
had no desire for further proof. His heart leaped for joy, and he cast himself at
the feet of Jesus• crying, 'My Lord and my God!'
    "Jesus accepted his acknowledgment, but gently reproved his unbelief:
`Thomas, because thou bait seen Me, thou hast believed; blessed are they
that have not seen, and yet have believed.' The faith of Thomas would have
been more pleasing to Christ if he had been willing to believe upon the testi-
mony of his brethren. Should the world now follow the example of Thomas,
no one would believe unto salvation; for all who receive Christ must do so
through the testimony of others."—The Desire of Ages, page 807.



                    Lesson 6, for February 7, 1942

                       "I Will Come Again"
    MEMORY VERSE: "Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe
also in Me. In My Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have
told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I
will come again, and receive you unto Myself; that where I am, there ye may be also."
John 14:1-3.
    STUDY HELP: "The Coming King," J. E. White, pages 68-78.

                       His Promised Return
  1. After telling His disciples that He was about to leave them, what
comforting promise did Christ make? John 14:1-3.
    2. With what glory will He appear? Luke 9:26.
    3. What will be the attitude of the world in general toward His appear-
ing? 2 Peter 3:3, 4.
   NorE.—"We are near the close of time. . . . The retributive judgments of
God are already in the land. The Lord has given us warning of the events
about to take place. Light is shining from His word, yet darkness covers the
earth, and gross darkness the people. 'While they shall cry, Peace and safety,
sudden destruction cometh upon them, and they shall not escape' . . .
   "In infinite mercy, a last warning message has been sent to the world,
announcing that Christ is at the door, and calling attention to God's broken
law. But as the antediluvians rejected with scorn the warning of Noah, so
will the pleasure lovers of today reject the message of God's faithful servants.
The world pursues its unvarying round, absorbed as ever in its business and
                                        [ 15
its pleasures, while the wrath of God is about to be visited on the transgres-
sors of His law."—Testimonies, vol. 5, pp. 99, 100.
    4. Of whom will the Saviour be ashamed at His coming? Mark 8:38.
                            Timely Warnings
     5. Against what are Christ's followers warned when His appearing is
near? Luke 21:34-36.
    6. What attempts to counterfeit His coming may be expected? Matt.
24 : 23-26.
    NOTE.—"The teaching so widely echoed from popular pulpits, that the
second advent of Christ is His coming to each individual at death, is a device
to divert the minds of men from His personal coming in the clouds of heaven.
For years Satan has thus been saying, 'Behold, He is in the secret chambers;'
and many souls have been lost by accepting this deception."—The Great
Controversy, page 525.
    7. What illustration is used to show that the coming of Christ is not to
be secret or obscure? Matt. 24:27; compare Rev. 1:7.

                    The Object of His Appearing
    8. What will the Saviour do for every man at His coming? Matt.
16:27; Rev. 22:12.
    NorE.—Those who have chosen to serve the Master, and to be true to
God's commandments will in that hour be caught up to meet their Lord, ever
to dwell with Him through the eternal years. 1 Thess. 4:16, 17. It is an hour
of death for the living wicked, an hour of triumphant victory for the right-
eous. To every man rewards are given according as his life has been in the
sight of a just God.
    9. In that day what part will be assigned to the angels? Matt. 24:31.
    10. What definite division will be made between the righteous and the
ungodly? Matt. 25:31, 32.
    11. How does the Saviour in this parable distinguish these two classes?
Verses 34-45.
    NoTE.—"The same voice that with patient, loving entreaty invites the
sinner to come to Him and find pardon and peace, will in the judgment bid
the rejecters of His mercy, 'Depart from Me, ye cursed.' In all the Bible, God
is represented not only as a tender father, but as a righteous judge. Though
He delights in showing mercy, and 'forgiving iniquity and transgression and
sin,' yet He 'will by no means clear the guilty.'"—Patriarchs and Prophets,
page 469.
    12. How did Christ joyfully anticipate association with His disciples
in His kingdom? Luke 22:18.
   NorE.—"Soon we heard His lovely voice again, saying, 'Come, My people,
you have come out of great tribulation, and done My will; suffered for Me;
come in to supper, for I will gird Myself, and serve you.' We shouted, 'Alle-
luia! glory I' and entered into the city. And I saw a table of pure silver; it
was many miles in length, yet our eyes could extend over it. I saw the fruit
of the tree of life, the manna, almonds, figs, pomegranates, grapes, and many
                                     1167
other kinds of fruit. I asked Jesus to let me eat of the fruit. He said, 'Not
now. Those who eat of the fruit of this land, go back to earth no more. But
in a little while, if faithful, you shall both eat of the fruit of the tree of life,
and drink of the water of the fountain.' "—Early Writings, pages 19, 20.
    13. To what glorious occasion do the children of God look forward
when partaking of the communion? 1 Cor. 11:26; Rev. 19:9.
    NOTE.—"The communion service points to Christ's second coming. It was
designed to keep this hope vivid in the minds of the disciples. Whenever they
met together to commemorate His death, they recounted how 'He took the
cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; for this
is My blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission
of sins. But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the
vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in My Father's kingdom.'
In their tribulation they found comfort in the hope of their Lord's return.
Unspeakably precious to them was the thought, 'As often as ye eat this bread,
and drink this cup, ye do show the Lord's death till He come.' "—The Desire
of Ages, page 659.


                   Lesson 7, for February 14, 1942
   Old Testament Prophecies of Christ's Second
                  Appearing
   MEMORY VERSE: "Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth, which have
wrought His judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in
the day of the Lord's anger." Zeph. 2:3.
    STUDY HELP: "The Return of Jesus," C. B. Haynes, pages 83-91.

                         In the Patriarchal Days
    1. By whom and in what words was uttered the earliest recorded proph-
ecy of Christ's second coming in judgment? Jude 14, 15.
    NOTE.—"Malachi also foretells His [Christ's] second advent, His coming
for the execution of the judgment. . . . Jude refers to the same scene when he
says, 'Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of His saints.'"—The
Great Controversy, pages 425, 426.
    2. While seeking to curse Israel, regarding what feature of Christ's
mission did Balaam prophesy? Num. 24:17-19. (See Rev. 1:7.)
    3. Unto whom did Jacob say the gathering of the people would be?
Gen. 49:10.
    4. What assurance concerning his Redeemer did Job express? Job
19:23-27.
    5. To what time did he look forward for his resurrection? Job 14:13-15.
    NoTE.—Job speaks of his resting in the grave till he should be called. He
is assured that when that hour comes he will respond. In 1 Thessalonians 4:16
we are told, "The Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with
the voice of the Archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ
shall rise first." How closely this parallels Job's words, "Thou shalt call, and
                                        [ 17 1
I will answer Thee." In his heart was the blesied hope, and by faith he saw
the coming of his Redeemer.
                       In the Days of the Kings
    6. In what burning words does the psalmist describe the coming of the
Lord? Ps. 50:3-5.
    NOTE.—}low beautifully and how majestically does the Hebrew poet here
portray the second coming of Christ at the end of the world. Of that solemn
and awesome hour the revelator speaks in chapter 6, verses 12-17, describing
the signs that precede His appearing, and then the scene itself, in these memo-
rable words; "the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and
every mountain and island were moved out of their places." In that terrible
hour the kings, the great men, the rich and mighty men, bondmen, freemen,
all who have flouted the grace of God, and have failed to prepare for Christ's
coming in power and glory, will say to the mountains and rocks, "Fall on us,
and hide us from the face of Him that sitteth on the throne, and from the
wrath of the Lamb: for the great day of His wrath is come; and who shall be
able to stand?" Small wonder that the psalmist, looking down the corridor
of the ages in vision exclaims, "A fire shall devour before Him, and it shall
be very tempestuous round about Him." It will be a day of fear and dread to
the ungodly—a time of trial and retribution. But the righteous will be hid
in the day of God's anger.
    7. How does the prophet Isaiah speak of the second gathering of Israel?
Isa. 11:11, 12.
    8. With what joyful words of welcome are the righteous to greet their
returning Lord? Isa. 25:9.
    9. How is the salvation of the righteous at Christ's coming described?
Isa. 62:10-12.
    10. In what prophecy does Daniel foretell the setting up of Christ's
kingdom? Dan. 2:44, 45.
    NoTE.—"His is not a kingdom built with human hands. It comes not by
human legislation. Like the stone cut out 'without hands,' the kingdom of
God will be set up by no human agencies or powers. Christ will appear the
second time, and the history of earthly empire will end with the destruction
of sin.
    "This is next in the order of events. 'The dream is certain, and the inter-
pretation thereof sure.' Happy the one who knows this coming King now as
his Saviour from sin, the 'Friend of sinners,' who died in our stead, that we
might have part in the everlasting kingdom soon to come."—W. A. Spicer,
Beacon Lights of Prophecy, page 51.
    11. What does the prophet say precedes the deliverance of God's people?
Dan. 12:1.
    12. During the days of trouble on earth, what important work is going
on in the heavenly sanctuary? Mal. 3:1-3.
   NorE.—The Adventist believers who were looking for Christ to come at
the end of the twenty-three hundred days, on October 22, 1844, were bitterly
disappointed. In commenting on the light that explained this disappointment,
Mrs. E. G. White has written:
                                     L 18 ]
    "Christ had come, not to the earth, as they expected, but, as foreshadowed
in the type, to the most holy place of the temple of God in heaven. He is
represented by the prophet Daniel as coming at this time to the Ancient of
Days: 'I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came
with the clouds of heaven, and came'—not to the earth, but—`to the Ancient
of Days, and they brought Him near before Him.' Daniel 7:13.
    "This coming is foretold also by the prophet Malachi: 'The Lord, whom
ye seek, shall suddenly come to His temple, even the messenger of the cove-
nant, whom ye delight in: behold, He shall come, saith the Lord of hosts.' Mal.
3:1. The coming of the Lord to His temple was sudden, unexpected, to His
people. They were not looking for Him there. They expected Him to come
to earth."—The Great Controversy, page 424.
    Then began the work of investigative judgment, which continues until the
close of probation. During this time Christ sits "as a refiner and purifier of
silver."
   13. With what solemn words does the prophet Zephaniah call for
preparation against the day of the Lord's anger? Zeph. 2:1-3.



                   Lesson 8, for February 21, 1942

  New Testament Prophecies of Christ's Second
                 Appearing
   MEMORY VERSE: "Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto
them that look for Him shall He appear the second time without sin unto salvation."
Heb. 9:28.
   STUDY HELP: "The Acts of the Apostles," pages 25-34.

                           "This Same Jesus"
    1. What was the message of the angels at the time of the ascension of
Jesus? Acts 1:10, 11.
    NOTE.—"The promise of Christ's second coming was ever to be kept fresh
in the minds of His disciples. The same Jesus whom they had seen ascending
into heaven, would come again, to take to Himself those who here below
give themselv
            es to His service. The same voice that had said to them, To, I
am with you alway, even unto the end,' would bid them welcome to His
presence in the heavenly kingdom."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 33.
    2. How did Peter express the same truth in one of his early appeals
to the Jews? Acts 3:20.
                   Paul's Recorded Predictions
   3. What details of Christ's coming are rehearsed by Paul? 2 Thess.
1:6-10.
    4. According to the teaching of Paul, at what time are the dead to
arise? 1 Cor. 15:23, 52.
    5. What standard of character should be the goal of those who are
looking for Christ's coming? 1 Thess. 3 : 13.
                                  r 19 j
     6. What two groups of the righteous does the apostle state will meet
the Lord at His coming? 1 Thess. 4:14-17.
     7. How does Paul indicate that much time would elapse between his
day and the Master's return? 2 Thess. 2:1-8.
    Nora.—"The apostle Paul warned the church not to look for the coming
of Christ in his day. 'That day shall not come,' he says, 'except there come a
falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed.' Not till after the great
apostasy, and the long period of the reign of the 'man of sin,' can we look for
the advent of our Lord. The 'man of sin,' which is also styld the 'mystery of
iniquity,' the 'son of perdition,' and `that wicked,' represents the papacy, which,
as foretold in prophecy, was to maintain its supremacy for 1260 years. This
period ended in 1798. The coming of Christ could not take place before that
time. Paul covers with his caution the whole of the Christian dispensation
down to the year 1798. It is this side of that time that the message of Christ's
second coming is to be proclaimed."—The Great Controversy, page 356.
    8. In Paul's final charge to Timothy, what two events are linked with
the second coming of Christ? 2 Tim. 4:1, 8.
    NOTE.—The apostle links in these scriptures the punishment of the wicked
at Christ's appearing and kingdom, and the reward of "all them also that love
His appearing." The manifestation of that love is thus expressed in The Desire
of Ages, page 549: "The one who stands nearest to Christ will be he who on
earth has drunk most deeply of the spirit of His self-sacrificing love,—love
that `vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, . . . seeketh not her own, is not
easily provoked, thinketh no evil,'—love that moves the disciple, as it moved
our Lord, to give all, to live and labor and sacrifice, even unto death, for the
saving of humanity."
    9. How does Paul speak of the.Master's return? Titus 2:13.
    10. What contrast does he draw between the first and second comings of
Christ? Heb. 9:28.
    NorE.—Christ came to earth to offer Himself a sacrifice for the sins of the
world. Through His death redemption from sin was made available for every
man. Just as surely as His work was done in its fullness at His first appearing,
so will He appear the second time to bring salvation to His people. "Christ,
at the close of His work as mediator, will appear, 'without sin unto salvation,'
to bless His waiting people with eternal life."—The Great Controversy, page
485.
                    The Witness of Other Apostles
    11. What counsel does James give to the church in the time of Christ's
second appearing? James 5:7, 8.
    12. What was the firm basis for the preaching of Christ's return?
2 Peter 1:16-18.
    NOTE.—Peter here refers to what he, James, and John had witnessed on
the mount of transfiguration. Moses "represented those who shall come forth
from the grave at the resurrection of the just. Elijah, who had been trans-
lated to heaven without seeing death, represented those who will be living
upon the earth at Christ's second coming, and who will be 'changed, in a
moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump.' . . . Jesus was
clothed with the light of heaven, as He will appear when He shall come the
                                    [ 20 ]
second time without sin unto salvation.' . . . Upon the mount the future
kingdom of glory was represented in miniature,—Christ the King, Moses
a representative of the risen saints, and Elijah of the translated ones."—
The Desire of Ages, pages 421, 422.
    13. What will be the character of God's children at Christ's appearing?
1 John 3:2.
    NOTE.—True Christians become followers of the Christ, "sons of God."
The rebirth, the transformation of character, makes them children of the
Most High. What we shall be when we meet our Saviour face to face at His
coming does not appear, is not grasped by our finite understanding. Now
we see and understand as "through a glass, darkly," but when we see Him
face to face, "we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is." What the
fullness of that revelation, of that transformation, will be is not revealed, but
we know "we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye."
The corruptible will be raised incorruptible, the mortal will put on im-
mortality, death will be swallowed up in victory. We shall all be made alive
in Christ. (See 1 Cor. 15:51-56.) Glorious transformation! Blessed hope!
Who would not exchange this world for the certainty of seeing "Him as
He is"?
    14. In the last chapter of the book of Revelation, what promise of the
Saviour is repeated, and what response made? Rev. 22:12, 20.
   NOTE.—
                     "'I quickly come,' 0 promise blest.
                      Soon I shall see Him face to face.
                      Left far behind, this world of sin—
                      I'll find with Him in heaven a place.
                      I know not how He will transform
                      Or change like His this mortal form—
                      I only know His work will be •
                     'Complete,—my life to His conform.
                      For this I wait in earnest hope,
                      And faithful work each passing day.
                      The tasks complete,—my Lord I'll see,—
                      And with Him live eternally."



                   Lesson 9, for February 28, 1942
          The Time of Christ's Second Coming
    MEMORY VERSE: "Likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it
is near, even at the doors." Matt. 24:33.
    STUDY HELP: "Earth's Last Hour," C. B. Haynes, pages 23-30.

                  The Day and the Hour Unknown
    1. Who alone knows the hour of Christ's return? Matt. 24:36.
    NOTE.—"The definite time of our Lord's coming is declared to be beyond
the ken of mortals. Even the angels who minister unto those who shall be heirs
of salvation, know not the day nor the hour. 'But of that day and hour know-
                                     [ 21
eth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but My Father only.' Because'the
times repeatedly set have passed, the world is in a more decided state of un-
belief than before in regard to the near advent of Christ. They look upon the
failures of the time setters with disgust; and because men have been so de-
ceived, they turn from the truth substantiated by the word of God, that the end
of all things is at hand."—Testintonies, vol. 4, page 307.
    2. Lacking this knowledge, what are all Christ's followers urged to do?
Verse 42.
    Nors.—"Because we know not the exact time of His coming, we are com-
manded to watch. 'Blessed are those servants, whom the Lord when He cometh
shall find watching.' Those who watch for the Lord's coming are not waiting in
idle expectancy. The expectation of Christ's coming is to make men fear the
Lord, and fear His judgments upon transgression. It is to awaken them to the
great sin of rejecting His offers of mercy. Those who are watching for the
Lord, are purifying their souls by obedience to the truth. With vigilant watch-
ing they combine earnest working. Because they know that the Lord is at the
door, their zeal is quickened to co-operate with the divine intelligences in work-
ing for the salvation of souls. These are the faithful and wise servants who give
to the Lord's household 'their portion of meat in due season.' They are declar-
ing the truth that is now specially applicable. As Enoch, Noah, Abraham, and
Moses, each declared the truth for his time. so will Christ's servants now give
the special warning for their generation."—The Desire of Ages, page 634.
     3. What pitfalls confront the people of God in the time of His appear-
ing? Luke 21:34-36.
    NOTE.—"There will be no future probation in which to prepare for eternity.
It is in this life that we are to put on the robe of Christ's righteousness. This is
our only opportunity to form characters for the home which Christ has made
ready for those who obey His commandments.
    "The days of our probation are fast closing. The end is near. To us the
warning is given, 'Take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be
overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that
day come upon you unawares.' Beware lest it find you unready."—Christ's
Object Lessons, page 319.
             Knowledge Regarding Times and Seasons
    4. What definite knowledge does the church have of Christ's second
appearing? 1 Thess. 5:1-5.
    5. How is the church encouraged when tempted to doubt the promise
of Christ's coming? Heb. 10:35-37.
    NOTE.—"He who died for the sins of the world, is opening wide the gates of
paradise to all who believe on Him. Soon the battle will have been fought, the
victory won. Soon we shall see Him in whom our hopes of eternal life are
centered. And in His presence the trials and sufferings of this life will seem as
nothingness. The former things 'shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.'
`Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompense of
reward. For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of
God, ye might receive the promise. For yet a little while, and He that shall
come will come, and will not tarry' `Israel shall be saved . . . with an ever-
lasting salvation: ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world without end.'
Look up, look up, and let your faith continually increase. Let this faith guide
                                       [ 22 1
"This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so
come in like manner as ye have seen Him go into heaven." Acts 1:11.
                             [23]
you along the narrow path that leads through the gates of the city into the
great beyond, the wide, unbounded future of glory that is for the redeemed."
—Prophets and Kings, page 732.
    6. What preparation will be made by the church that is looking for the
coming of the Lord? 1 John 3:2, 3.                                  •
    7. How graphically does Peter describe the physical phenomena asso-
ciated with the day of the Lord? How may His coming be hastened? 2
Peter 3:10-12.
    NorE.—"Christ is waiting with longing desire for the manifestation of
Himself in His church. When the character of Christ shall be perfectly re-
produced in His people, then He will come to claim them as His own.
    "It is the privilege of every Christian, not only to look for, but to hasten
the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Were all who profess His name bearing
fruit to His glory, how quickly the whole world would be sown with the seed
of the gospel. Quickly the last great harvest would be ripened, and Christ
would come to gather the precious grain."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 69.

           Signs to Indicate the Time of His Appearing
   8. What will many be saying in the time of the end? 2 Peter 3:3, 4.
    9. Among the nations of earth, what conditions will prevail? Joel 3:9,
10; Matt. 24:6, 7; Rev. 11:18.
    NoTE.—"Civilization does not lead men to Christ. The world has not ac-
cepted, and never will accept, Christ. The world cannot, therefore, stop war.
Wars grow out of human nature. Christ alone can change human nature.
Men will not come to Him for that change. So long as the race endures, there-
fore, war cannot be stopped—except by the destruction of the race that rejects
Christ.
    "War began almost as soon as sin began. From the beginning of the race
until now, war has existed and increased. Nothing that civilization, education,
or philanthropy has done, has been able to check it or stop it. And nothing that
man can devise or invent will stop it. The human race is doomed to destroy it-
self. It is feeding on its own flesh. Christ is its only hope, and it will not have
Christ. . . .
    "With the analogies of the past before us, and with the plain, clear teachings
of the word of God revealed to us, and with the warnings of the divine prophe-
cies unfolding to our understanding, we look for another war, a war as much
greater than the one called the World War as that was greater than all that
preceded it. [Some think it has already come, 1941.] It will be greater and
more destructive because, as predicted by ex-Secretary of War Baker, in a
speech in Boston, `Scientists will invent for another war weapons of destruction
beyond the comprehension of those who fought in the recent world conflict.' "
—The Return of Jesus, pages 175, 176.
    10. What signs in heaven and earth give evidence of the nearness of
His return? Luke 21:25, 26; Matt. 24:29-31.
   11. What conflict between rich and poor will precede His appearing?
James 5:1-8.
   12. In the social life of the nations and of the church, what conditions
will prevail? 2 Timothy 3:1-5.
                                      24
    NOTE.—The perilous times that face the church of Christ in these last days
are primarily due to spiritual declension within the church. Persecution from
without but drives the church nearer to its Redeemer. But when self-love,
love of the world, and love of pleasure invade the hearts of the children of God,
there is real danger to the church. The form of godliness is of no avail to hold
the hearts of men to the righteousness of obedience. The denial of the power of
godliness by unconsecrated formalities leads to the rejection by God, and even-
tually by His true church, of the one so controlled. He says, "from such turn
away." It would be well for every loyal Christian to study his life, lest, in these
days of peril, his daily contacts lead him unawares into the pitfalls set by the
enemy of souls.
    "The Bible declares that before the coming of the Lord there will exist a
state of religious declension similar to that in the first centuries.... Satan will
work 'with all power and signs and lying wonders, and with all deceivableness
of unrighteousness.' And all that 'received not the love of the truth, that they
might be saved,' will be left to accept 'strong delusion, that they should believe
a lie.' When this state of ungodliness shall be reached, the same results will
follow as in the first centuries."—The Great Controversy, page 444.
   13. How does the progress of God's last message become a sign of the
Saviour's coming? Matt. 24:14.
   14. When God's children see all these things begin to come to pass, what
should they know and do? Matt. 24:32-35; Luke 21:28.



                     Lesson 10, for March 7, 1942

                       The Remnant Church
    MEMORY VERSE: "The dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make
war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the
testimony of Jesus Christ." Rev. 12:17.
    STUDY HELP: "Prophets and Kings," pages 505, 506.

                 Who Are the Remnant Church?
    1. How does Jeremiah describe God's response to His children who turn
to Him in repentance? Jer. 29:11-14.
    2. From where did the apostle James say God would take out a people?
Acts 15:14.
                                                                             •
    3. How does Isaiah speak of God's purpose for this same people? Isa.
11:11.
   NOTE.—After quoting verses 10-12, the writer of Prophets and Kings,
page 376, says that "'The eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the
whole earth, to show Himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is per-
fect toward Him.' Among all nations, kindreds, and tongues, He sees men and
women who are praying for light and knowledge. Their souls are unsatisfied:
long have they fed on ashes. The enemy of all righteousness has turned them
aside, and they grope as blind men. But they are honest in heart, and desire to
learn a better way. Although in the depths of heathenism, with no knowledge
                                     1 261
of the written law of God nor of His Son Jesus, they have revealed in manifold
ways the working of a divine power on mind and character."
    4. Speaking of God's closing work for lost mankind, what promise is
made? Rom. 9:27, 28; 11:11, 12. (See also Isa. 10:22.)
                       The Work of the Remnant
     5. As we near the close of time, what may we expect concerning Satanic
activities? Rev. 12:12, last part.
     6. How are the remnant designated? What is said regarding Satan's
opposition to them? Verse 17.
     7. What message will God's people, the remnant, bear to the world?
Rev. 14:6-11.
     8. How may we know that the remnant of chapter twelve and the
bearers of the last threefold message are the same people? Rev. 12:17;
14:12.
    NOTE.—In both instances the people mentioned are keepers of God's com-
mandments. They are a remnant, the last part of God's church on earth, and
they live just before the coming of Christ (Rev. 14:12-14). The two scrip-
tures evidently refer to the same people, the remnant, the church existing at
Christ's coming, a church of loyal, faithful observers of God's law, looking for
the coming of the Saviour in the clouds of heaven.
     9. In what words had Christ Himself foretold the work of the remnant
church? Matt. 24:14.
    NOTE.—Christ foretold the giving of the gospel in earth's closing days as a
preparation for His second coming. Of the meaning of our Lord's words, we
read: "Long has God waited for the spirit of service to take possession of the
whole church, so that everyone shall be working for Him according to his abil-
ity. When the members of the church of God do their appointed work in the
needy fields at home and abroad, in fulfillment of the gospel commission, the
whole world will soon be warned, and the Lord Jesus will return to this earth
with power and great glory."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 111.
    10. Who is with the remnant as they go forth to give the message to the
world? Matt. 28:18-20; Isa. 43:4-7, 10-12.
                      The Remnant on Mount Zion
     11. In what glowing words does the revelator describe the gathering
of the saved about God's throne? Rev. 7:9, 14, 15.
 • 12. What song of triumph will they sing in that day? Rev. 15:2-4.
    NorE.—"We may have a vision of the future, the blessedness of heaven. In
the Bible are revealed visions of future glory, scenes pictured by the hand of
God, and these are dear to His church. By faith we may stand on the threshold
of the eternal city, and hear the gracious welcome given to those who in this
life co-operate with Christ, regarding it as an honor to suffer for His sake. As
the words are spoken, 'Come, ye blessed of My Father,' they cast their crowns
at the feet of the Redeemer, exclaiming, 'Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to
receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory, and
blessing. . . . Honor, and glory, and power, be unto Him that sitteth upon the
throne, and unto the Lamb forever and ever.'
                                      [26 ]
    "There the redeemed greet those who led them to the Saviour, and all unite
in praising Him who died that human beings might have the life that measures
with the life of God. The conflict is over. Tribulation and strife are at an end.
Songs of victory fill all heaven as the ransomed ones take up the joyful strain,
Worthy, worthy is the Lamb that was slain, and lives again, a triumphant con-
queror."—The Acts of the Apostles, pages 601, 602.



                    Lesson 11, for March 14, 1942
              The Gathering of the Remnant
  MEMORY VERSE: "He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till He have set judg-
ment in the earth: and the isles shall wait for His law." Isa. 42:4.
  STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pages 818-828.

                God's Plan for Gathering His People
    1. Through whom does the apostle say God will proclaim the gospel?
Rom. 10 : 13-15.
    2. To whom has the commission to preach God's message been given?
Matt. 28:18-20.
    NoTE.—The commission to His disciples to give the gospel to all the world,
to teach all nations, included every member of the church of God. It applied
then, it applies equally today. "Heavenly angels have long been waiting for
human agents—the members of the church—to co-operate with them in the
great work to be done. They are waiting for you. So vast is the field, so com-
prehensive the design, that every sanctified heart will be pressed into service as
an instrument of divine power."—Testimonies, vol. 9, pp. 46, 47. In the final
ingathering of the remnant from all lands, every individual and all the resources
of those who join the remnant will be employed for the quick finishing of the
work.
    3. What will be the nature of the task committed to Christ's disciples?
Matt. 10:16-20.
    NOTE.—"What course shall the advocates of truth pursue? They have the
unchangeable, eternal word of God, and they should reveal the fact that they
have the truth as it is in Jesus. Their words must not be rugged or sharp. In
their presentation of truth they must manifest the love and meekness and gen-
tleness of Christ. Let the truth do the cutting; the word of God is as a sharp,
two-edged sword, and will cut its way to the heart. Those who know that they
have the truth should not, by the use of harsh and severe expressions, give
Satan one chance to misinterpret their spirit."—Gospel Workers, page 324.
    When the servants of the Lord Jesus go forth as sheep among Wolves, the
character displayed by them in all their contacts and all their dealings with
opposition, misrepresentation, and persecution, will be the Master's. We are
His witnesses, called to display to a lost world the spirit He manifested when
He lived and served and died among and for lost men.

                        The World's Great Need
     4. How did the Saviour state the need of the world in His day? Matt.
9 : 36-38.
                                   [ 271
   5. For what purpose had He come into the world? John 4:34.
   6. In the hour of the world's great spiritual darkness, to what are
Christ's disciples called? Isa. 60:1-5.
    7. Where are the sheep of God's pasture said to be scattered? Ezek. 34:6.
    8. What personal interest does the Lord say He has in them? Verses
11-13.
    9. What does He promise to do for His lost sheep? Who are they?
Verses 14-16, 31.
    NoTE.—Ezekiel was given a vision of the gathering of the lost sheep of the
house of Israel, the scattered children of the house of God. The shepherds to
whom had been committed the task of caring for the flock had proved recreant
to the task. God promises that He will seek out His sheep, gather them from
every country in which they have been scattered in the dark days of the reign
of sin, bring them again to their own land, and feed them in good pasture. While
condemning the indifference and selfishness of those who profess to be shep-
herds of the flock of God, He does not leave His sheep to suffer, but promises
to lead them to the Promised Land. How closely this parable prophecy paral-
lels the other promises of the ingathering of the Israel of God as listed in this
lesson in preparation for their entrance into the kingdom of peace, the realm
of the Father of love !
                  Completion of the Task Assured
    10. 'What prophecy expresses God's determination to see the task ac-
complished? Isa. 42:4.
    NorE.—The Saviour came into the world to bring "forth judgment unto
truth." The work which He began when plans were laid in the councils of
heaven for man's salvation, He continued by coming to the earth to die, to
shed His precious blood in man's behalf. When He returned to His Father at
His ascension, the work in behalf of mankind was continued. Through the
ministry of His Holy Spirit, of His word, and of heavenly angels, as well as
through human instrumentalities, He will continue that work of bringing
"forth judgment to the Gentiles," till "He have set judgment in the earth;"
and even the most distant "isles shall wait for His law." When that task is
completed, then He will come, and perform the final act of the original plan—
the gathering of the elect into His kingdom.
    11. In His great intercessory prayer, how does Christ express His desire
toward His followers? John 17:21-24.
    NOTE.—"Before the foundations of the earth were laid, the Father and the
Son had united in a covenant to redeem man if he should be overcome by
Satan. They had clasped their hands in a solemn pledge that Christ should
become the surety for the human race. This pledge Christ has fulfilled. When
upon the cross He cried out, 'It is finished,' He addressed the Father. The com-
pact had been fully carried out. Now He declares, Father, it is finished. I have
done Thy will, 0 My God. I have completed the work of redemption. If Thy
justice is satisfied, will that they also, whom Thou hast given Me, be with
Me where I am.' "—The Desire of Ages, page 834.
    12. What power is assured for the finishing of the work? Acts 1 : 8.
    NOTE.—"The Saviour knew that no argument, however logical, would
melt hard hearts, or break through the crust of worldliness and selfishness. He
                                       [ 28 ]
knew that His disciples must receive the heavenly endowment ; that the gospel
would be effective only as it was proclaimed by hearts made warm and lips
made eloquent by a living knowledge of Him who is the way, the truth, and
the life. The work committed to the disciples would require great efficiency;
for the tide of evil ran deep and strong against them. A vigilant, determined
leader was in command of the forces of darkness, and the followers of Christ
could battle for the right only through the help that God, by His Spirit, would
give them."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 31.
             The Perfect Character of the Chosen Ones
  13. What is said of the character of the remnant, those who look for
Christ's appearing? Zeph. 3:13.
  14. How are the same people described by the revelator? Rev. 14:1-5.
    15. How does Paul describe the purified church? Eph. 5:27.
    NOTE.—The remnant church will be a church cleansed from the defilement
of sin. The weaknesses that once defiled their lives will have been taken from
them, and the power of Christ will have taken its place. Earnest, loyal, faith-
ful, loving the Lord Jesus with all their hearts, they will seek by the submission
of their lives to Him, to be like Him. His remnant church will be presdnted to
Him without "spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing," "holy and without blem-
ish." Yet this is not the result of their strivings, but of the submission of their
wills to His will. It comes from His cleansing blood. Its power is the result of
His indwelling Spirit.
    16. When at last they stand redeemed, with what will they be clothed?
Rev. 19:8.
    NOTE.—"It is the righteousness of Christ, His own unblemished character,
that through faith is imparted to all who receive Him as their personal Say-
iour."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 310.



                      Lesson 12, for March 21, 1942
                   Conflict Before Deliverance
    MEMORY VERSE: "Come, My people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut
thy doors about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be
overpast." Isa. 26:20.
    STUDY HELPS: "The Great Controversy," chapter 39; "Patriarchs and Proph-
ets," pages 195-203.
                             Tribulation and Trial
    1. What will befall the world before the hour of the deliverance of God's
people? Dan. 12:1.
    2. What further statement identifies this time of trouble with the end
of the world? Verse 2.
    NOTE.—"Graves are opened, and 'many of them that sleep in the dust of
the earth . . . awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and ever-
lasting contempt.' All who have died in the faith of the third angel's message
come forth from the tomb glorified, to hear God's covenant of peace with
                                          129 1
those who have kept His law. 'They also which pierced Him,' those that
mocked and derided Christ's dying agonies, and the most violent opposers of
His truth and His people, are raised to behold Him in His glory, and to see
the honor placed upon the loyal and obedient."—The Great Controversy,
page 637.
    3. In writing to Timothy, what does Paul say will be the experience of
the godly? 2 Tim. 3:12.
    4. In the hour of conflict, what counsel is given God's children? Isa.
26:20, 21.
    NoTE.—"Men who claim to be Christians may now defraud and oppress the
poor; they may rob the widow and the fatherless; they may indulge their
satanic hatred because they cannot control the consciences of God's people;
but for all this God will bring them into judgment. They 'shall have judgment
without mercy' that have 'showed no mercy.' Not long hence they will stand
before the Judge of all the earth, to render an account for the pain they have
caused to the bodies and souls of His heritage. They may now indulge in false
accusations, they may deride those whom God has appointed to do His work,
they may consign His believing ones to prison, to the chain gang, to banish-
ment, to death ; but for every pang of anguish, every tear shed, they must an-
swer. God will reward them double for their sins."—Christ's Object Lessons,
pages 178, 179.
    5. What does Jeremiah call this period of conflict as it affects God's
chosen ones? Jer. 30 : 7.
    NOTE.—"Jacob's night of anguish, when he wrestled in prayer for deliver-
ance from the hand of Esau, represents the experience of God's people in the
time of trouble."
    "As Satan accuses the people of God on account of their sins, the Lord per-
mits him to try them to the uttermost. Their confidence in God, their faith and
firmness, will be severely tested. As they review the past, their hopes sink;
for in their whole lives they can see little good. They are fully conscious of
their weakness and unworthiness. Satan endeavors to terrify them with the
thought that their cases are hopeless, that the stain of their defilement will
never be washed away. He hopes so to destroy their faith that they will yield
to his temptations, and turn from their allegiance to God."—The Great Con-
troversy, pages 616, 618, 619. Read the• entire chapter for study helps for the
full experience of God's people in this hour of final conflict.
                      The Lot of the Righteous
    6. In the days of papal Rome, what was the lot of the saints? Rev. 13:7.
    NoTE.—"Now began the 1260 years of papal oppression foretold in the
prophecies of Daniel and the Revelation. Christians were forced to choose
either to yield their integrity and accept the papal ceremonies and worship,
or to wear away their lives in dungeons or suffer death by the rack, the fagot,
or the headsman's ax. Now were fulfilled the words of Jesus: 'Ye shall be be-
trayed both by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolks, and friends; and some
of you shall they cause to be put to death. And ye shall be hated of all men
for My name's sake.' Persecution opened upon the faithful with greater fury
than ever before, and the world became a vast battlefield. For hundreds of
years the church of Christ found refuge in seclusion and obscurity."—The
Great Controversy, pages 54, 55.
                                      30
    7. When the image to the beast shall come to full power, what similar
experience will be the portion of the remnant? Rev. 13:15-17.
   Nom—Although an apostate power will in the final conflict persecute the
members of God's remnant church, we are assured that "Even now they [God's
chosen ones] are appearing in every nation, among every tongue and people ;
and in the hour of deepest apostasy, when Satan's supreme effort is made to
cause 'all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond,' to receive, un-
der penalty of death, the sign of allegiance to a false rest day, these faithful
ones, 'blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke,' will 'shine as
lights in the world.' The darker the night, the more brilliantly will they
shine."—Prophets and Kings, page 189.
    8. In the type city of Babylon, what will be revealed? Rev. 18:24.
   NOTE.—"The state of corruption and apostasy that in the last days would
exist in the religious world, was presented to the prophet John, in the vision
of Babylon, 'that great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth.' Be-
fore its destruction the call is to be given from heaven, 'Come out of her, My
people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her
plagues.' "—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 167.
    9. What definite promise is made to the righteous concerning this time
of peril? Isa. 33:14-16.
   10. What outstanding character will the saints then display? Rev.
13:10, last part; 14:12.
   11. Through what does the multitude of the redeemed come? Rev. 7:14.
                         God's People Delivered
     12. Who are the only ones who will be delivered at the end of the time
of trouble? Dan. 12:1, last part.
    NorE.—"When Christ shall cease His work as mediator in man's behalf,
then this time of trouble will begin. Then the case of every soul will have
been decided, and there will be no atoning blood to cleanse from sin. When
Jesus leaves His position as man's intercessor before God, the solemn an-
nouncement is made, `He that is unjust, let him be unjust still; and he which
is filthy, let him be filthy still; and he that is righteous, let him be righteous
still; and he that is holy, let him be holy still.' Then the restraining Spirit of
God is withdrawn from the earth. As Jacob was threatened with death by his
angry brother, so the people of God will be in peril from the wicked who are
seeking to destroy them. And as the patriarch wrestled all night for deliver-
ance from the hand of Esau, so the righteous will cry to God day and night
for deliverance from the enemies that surround them."
    "Those who are unwilling to forsake every sin and to seek earnestly for
God's blessing, will not obtain it. But all who will lay hold of God's promises
as did Jacob, and be as earnest and persevering as he was, will succeed as he
succeeded. 'Shall not God avenge His own elect, which cry day and night
unto Him, though He bear long with them? I tell you that He will avenge
them speedily.' "—Patriarchs and Prophets, pages 201, 203.
     13. What is said of those who will forever dwell with Christ? Rev.
17:14, last part.
-+                                                                              4—

                   Lesson 13, for March 28, 1942

                At Home With Our Saviour
   MEMORY VERSE: "Father, I will that they also, whom Thou hast given Me, be
with Me where I am; that they may behold My glory, which Thou hast given Me: for
Thou lovedst Me before the foundation of the world." John 17:24.
   STUDY HELP: "The Great Controversy," chapters 40, 42.

                       The Time of Deliverance
    1. With what event is the deliverance of God's people connected? 1
Thess. 4:15-17.
   NOTE.—The deliverance of God's people is directly connected with the
second coming of Christ. The righteous, those whose names are written in the
Lamb's book of life as victorious over sin, will in that day be "caught up . . .
to meet the Lord in the air." The scriptures link closely together the days of
final conflict, and the coming of the Lord to deliver His people forever from
the power of the enemy,—the -coming of Christ and the redemption of His
people following immediately the culmination of the time of conflict.
    2. What change will be wrought in God's children at that time? 1 Cor.
15:51-55.
    3. What is Christ's reason for the redemption of His brethren? John
17:24.
    4. With whom will the saints dwell after their deliverance? Rev. 21:3;
7:15.
                   One Thousand Years in Heaven
    5. Where will the saints go at Christ's coming? 1 Thess. 4:17; Rev. 19:1.
    6. What city will be the center for the inhabitants of the heavenly land?
How is it described? Rev. 21:9-21.
    7. Who are the temple and light of the New Jerusalem? Rev. 21:22,
23; Isa. 60:19, 20; Rev. 22 : 3-5.
    NOTE.—"In the city of God 'there shall be no night.' None will need or de-
sire repose. There will be no weariness in doing the will of God and offering
praise to His name. We shall ever feel the freshness of the morning, and shall
ever be far from its close. 'And they need no candle, neither light of the sun;
for the Lord God giveth them light.' The light of the sun will be superseded by
a radiance which is not painfully dazzling, yet which immeasurably surpasses
the brightness of our noontide. The glory of God and the Lamb floods the
holy city with unfading light. The redeemed walk in the sunless glory of per-
petual day."—The Great Controversy, page 676.
    8. How are the inhabitants of the New Jerusalem described? Rev.
21:24-27.
    9. 'What river flows through it? Rev. 22:1, 2.
                      The City Descends to Earth
   10. With the end of the millennium, where does the New Jerusalem de-
scend? Rev. 21:1-5; Zech. 14:4, 5.
   NOTE.—"Christ descends upon the Mount of Olives, whence, after His
resurrection, He ascended, and where angels repeated the promise of His re-
                                   [ 321
turn. Says the prophet: 'The Lord my God shall come, and all the saints
with Thee.' And His feet shall stand in that day upon the Mount of Olives,
which is before Jerusalem on the east, and the Mount of Olives shall cleave
in the midst thereof, . and there shall be a very great valley.' And the Lord
shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall there be one Lord, and His
name one.' As the New Jerusalem, in its dazzling splendor, comes down out
of heaven, it rests upon the place purified and made ready to receive it, and
Christ, with His people and the angels, enters the holy city."—The Great
Controversy, pages 662, 663.
    11. Who will be raised at this time? What will they do? Rev. 20:5-9.
    NOTE.—What constitutes loosing Satan? The resurrection of the wicked
constitutes the loosing of Satan. He is again free to deceive and to lead his
forces against the Holy City before which they will eventually be annihilated.
    "Here [on earth] is to be the home of Satan with his evil angels for a
thousand years. Limited to the earth, he will not have access to other worlds,
to tempt and annoy those who have never fallen. It is in this sense that he is
bound: There are none remaining, upon whom he can exercise his power. He
is wholly cut off from the work of deception and ruin which for so many cen-
turies has been his sole delight."
    "At the close of the thousand years the second resurrection will take place.
Then the wicked will be raised from the dead, and appear before God for the
execution of 'the judgment written.' Thus the revelator, after describing the
resurrection of the righteous, says, 'The rest of the dead lived not again until
the thousand years were finished.' And Isaiah declares, concerning the wicked,
`They shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall
be shut up in the prison, and after many days shall they be visited.' "—The
Great Controversy, pages 659, 661.
    12. What will then be the fate of these forces of evil? Rev. 20 : 10-15.
    13. How does Isaiah, the gospel prophet, describe the new earth state?
Isa. 65:17-25; 35 :1-8.
    14. What human miseries will no longer exist? Rev. 7:16, 17; 21:4,
8, 27; 22:15.
    NOTE.—"Pain cannot exist in the atmosphere of heaven. There will be no
more tears, no funeral trains, no badges of mourning. 'There shall be no more
death, neither sorrow, nor crying, . .. for the former things are passed away.'
`The inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein shalt be
forgiven their iniquity.' "—The Great Controversy, page 676.
    15. For how long does God promise to continue this blessed state of the
redeemed? Isa. 66:22, 23.
    NOTE.—The scripture here reveals that God's people, as also the new earth
and the new heavens, purified, sinless, perfect, shall remain forever with no
more sorrow, suffering, or death. "And the years of eternity, as they roll, will
bring richer and still more glorious revelations of God and of Christ. As knowl-
edge is progressive, so will love, reverence, and happiness increase. The more
men learn of God, the greater will be their admiration of His character. As
Jesus opens before them the riches of redemption, and the amazing achieve-
ments in the great controversy with Satan, the hearts of the ransomed thrill
with more fervent devotion, and with more rapturous joy they sweep the
harps of gold; and ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands
of voices unite to swell the mighty chorus of praise."—The Great Controversy,
page 678.

           OF THE SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON

        There can be no greater agency for the cultivation of the
        daily Bible study habit than the daily study of the Sabbath
        school lesson, because-

1. "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth
    out of the mouth of God." Matt. 4:4.
2. The miracle of the manna each of the six working days indicated the
    daily need for the "bread of life."
3. Spiritual life can be nourished only by spiritual food, and neglect of the
    Bible brings spiritual weakness.
4. The future experiences of the people of God will require a living faith.
    "Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God." Rom. 10:17.
5. The psalmist declared that the engrafted word is essential to salvation.
    Ps. 119:11.
6. Christ conquered Satan through the use of memorized Scripture. How
    else can I meet him? Matt. 4:4, 7, 10.
7. Daily study of the Bible is more important than daily food for our phys-
    ical needs. Job 23:12 ; John 6:63.
8. We must study if we are to "be ready always to give an answer to every
    man that asketh . . . a reason of the hope that is in" us. 1 Peter 3:15.
9. It will make me a growing Christian and an increasingly helpful Sabbath
    school member.
10. "None but those who have fortified the mind with the truths of the Bible
    will stand through the last great conflict."—The Great Controversy,
    pages 593, 594.

that primitive western part of Brazil, is to be opened by locating a
worker in that vast section. For years we have operated a hospital at
Juliaca, in the Lake Titicaca region of Peru. This "overflow" will pro-
vide a greatly needed nurses' home. In the extreme southern tip of the
continent is Tierra del Fuego; Chubut is the headquarters of the Ma-
gellan Mission. This overflow will provide a chapel for the company of
believers and a mission home for the worker's family in that cold, damp
climate. Our believers in South America heartily unite with us in every
call to sacrifice. Let us give liberally to their field!
   The Thirteenth Sabbath Offering "overflow" to South America the
second quarter of 1940 was $9,122.81. This was devoted to various
medical missionary enterprises, one of which was a new boat for the
Lower Amazon Mission.
   South America appeals for a generous offering the last Sabbath of
this quarter. Will you not do your best to further the gospel message
by helping to meet their needs?
