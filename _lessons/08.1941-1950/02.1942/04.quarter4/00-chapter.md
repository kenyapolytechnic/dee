            This Individual Sabbath School Offering Goal chart
        will appear in each Quarterly. Systematic giving week by
        week is becoming more and more a practice, and this
        chart is inserted by request. Many Sabbath school mem-
        bers are giving a dollar or more each week, and this goal
        chart will enable them to keep an accurate record of their
        covenant with God.

           "God has devised a plan by which all may give as He
        has prospered them, and which will make giving a habit
        without waiting for special calls. Those who can do this,
        but will not because of their selfishness, are robbing their
        Creator, who has bestowed upon them means to invest in
        His cause to advance its interests."—Testimonies, vol. 3,
        p. 411.

                      Lesson 1, for October 3, 1942
                    God's Guidance and Care
    MEMORY VERSE: "Thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is
the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to thileft."
Isa. 30.21.
    STUDY HELPS: "'Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing," pages 139-162;
"The Ministry of Healing," pages 469-482.
    SEED THOUGHT: "Let us be hopeful and courageous. Despondency in God's
service is sinful and unreasonable. He knows our every necessity. To the omnipotence
of the King of kings our covenant-keeping God unites the gentleness and care of the
tender shepherd. His power is absolute, and it is the pledge of the sure fulfillment of
His promises to all who trust in Him. He has means for the removal of every difficulty,
that those who serve Him and respect the means He employs may be sustained. His
love is as far above all other love as the heavens are above the earth. He watches over
His children with a love that is measureless and everlasting."—"The Ministry of Heal-
ing," pages 481, 482.
                           God's Directing Ways
    1. What prayer is appropriate for all Christians? Ps. 31:3.
    2. Whom has the Lord promised to guide in judgment? Ps. 25:9.
    3. How personal is the guidance which the Lord gives His people? Ps.
32:8; 73:24.
    NorE.—"The Bible shows us God in His high and holy place, not in a state
of inactivity, not in silence and solitude, but surrounded by ten thousand
times ten thousand and thousands of thousands of holy beings, all waiting to
do His will. Through these messengers He is in active communication with
every part of His dominion. By His Spirit He is everywhere present. Through
the agency of His Spirit and His angels, He ministers to the children of men.
    "Above the distractions of the earth He sits enthroned; all things are open
to His divine survey; and from His great and calm eternity He orders that
which His providence sees best."—The Ministry of Healing, page 417.
    4. What is necessary on our part that the Lord may direct us? Prov.
3:6.
    5. What will the Holy Spirit do? John 16 : 13. Compare Isa. 30 : 21.
    6. What guiding care has the Lord always provided for His people?
Deut. 1:30-33; Ps. 32:1; Heb. 13:5, 6.
    NOTE.—It is the prilege of each child of God to know He leads the way
before him. See Ps. 23:2, 3.
                     The Heavenly Father's Concern
    7. What gracious invitation does the Lord extend to the burden bearers?
Ps. 55:22; Matt. 11:28-30.
                                         [ 81
     NOTE.-It may seem at first thought strange to tell a burden bearer that
the way to find rest is to take upon him another burden, a yoke, though it be
easy and light. But it is a different yoke from that of sin; it is Christ's yoke.
     We place a water wheel upon a river that we may compel the river to spin,
to weave, and to grind grain for us. We place a sail upon a boat to yoke the
wind so that the boat may plow furrows in the deep for a nation's commerce.   _
We yoke the steam to drive locomotives, the electric current to send messages,
to drive motors, and to light cities. Nothing is of any vital use to mankind until
it is harnessed, yoked, and made obedient to the will of man. In this text of
scripture (Matt. 11:28-30) Christ lays down the same general principle in
our relationship to Him. Freedom of right action comes with the repression
of self. His yoke is easy and His burden is light if we are submissive to His
yoke, harnessed to His service. When we are submitted to His will, then His
power surges through us. When we are constrained, then His power can use
us to His glory.
     8. What did the Lord say concerning the affliction and persecution of
His people in Egypt? Ex. 3:7, 8.
     NoTE.—"The affliction of My people." What love and care for His own is
here, and throughout the Scriptures, expressed by these two words, "My peo-
ple"! God said to Pharaoh, "Let My people go." The marvelous deliverance
at the Red Sea was "for Israel's sake." The Spirit of prophecy says the dearest
object on earth to the heart of God, is His church. "He that toucheth you
toucheth the apple of His eye." Zech. 2:8.
     9. What admonition has the Lord given us concerning the things of
this life? Matt. 6:25.
     NoTE.—The Revised Version renders Matthew 6:25, thus: "Be not anxious
for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body,
what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than the food, and the body than
the raiment?"
     10. To what extent is the Lord's care exercised over the creatures He
has made? Verse 26; Matt. 10:29-31. Compare Luke 12:6, 7.
     NOTE.—Two sparrows for one farthing, or five for two farthings. One is
added, or thrown in, where the purchase was two farthings. The thought is
that the one given away as of no comparative value is not forgotten by the
Lord. Then the statement, which if possible goes still farther in expressing
the intimate watchcare of our heavenly Father, "But the very hairs of your
head are all numbered." With the psalmist we can exclaim, "Such knowledge
is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it." Ps. 139:6.
     "Sometimes it is hard to believe that the infinite God, who holds the seas
in His hand, and controls the stars in their courses, should care for each indi-
vidual soul. We are so small, and God's universe is so great ! We .are but
insects on a world which is but a grain of sand to many of the stars. . . . If
He provides for birds and flowers, for the insects of an hour, for the bees, 'the
singing masons building roofs of gold,' how much more will He care for the
souls and bodies of His children, made in His own likeness !"—Peloubet's Notes.
                  Helper and Deliverer in Affliction
   11. When the Hebrew worthies were cast into the fiery furnace, how
personal was the Lord's care for them? Dan. 3:26, 27.
   12. When Daniel was cast into the lions' den, what care did the-Lord
have over him? Dan. 6:19-23. •
                                   f4l
    13. When Peter was in prison, what deliverance came as a token of
the Lord's care? Acts 12:6-10.
    14. What assurance came to the apostle Paul on the stormy sea? Acts
27 : 23-25.
    15. 'When he stood alone as a prisoner before Nero's judgment seat,
what care was manifested by the Lord in his behalf? 2 Tim. 4:16, 17.
    16. In the time of trouble, where may the confiding children of the
Lord find refuge? Ps. 91:1-10.
    NorE.—"We need to understand better than we do the mission of the an-
gels. It would be well to remember that every true child of God has the co-
operation of heavenly beings. Invisible armies of light and power attend the
meek and lowly ones who believe and claim the promises of God. Cherubim
and seraphim, and angels that excel in strength, stand at God's right hand, 'all
ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of sal-
vation.' "—The Acts of the Apostles, page 154.


                     Lesson 2, for October 10, 1942
                 Reverence for God's Presence
    MEMORY VERSE: "Ye shall keep My Sabbaths, and reverence My sanctuary:
I am the Lord." Lev. 26:2.
    STUDY HELPS: "Testimonies," vol. 5, pp. 491-500; "Prophets and Kings,"
pages 47-50.
    SEED THOUGHT: "Humility and reverence should characterize the deportment
of all who come into the presence of God. In the name of Jesus we may come before
Him with confidence, but we must not approach Him with the boldness of presumption,
as though He were on a level with ourselves. There are those who address the great
and all-powerful and holy God, who dwelleth in light unapproachable, as they would ad-
dress an equal, or even an inferior. There are those who conduct themselves in His
house as they would not presume to do in the audience chamber of an earthly ruler.
These should remember that they are in His sight whom seraphim adore, before whom
angels veil their faces. God is greatly to be reverenced; all who truly realize His
presence will bow in humility before Him, and, like Jacob beholding the vision of God,
they will cry out, 'How dreadful is this place! This is none other but the house of
God, and this is the gate of heaven.' "—"Patriarchs and Prophets," page 252.

                               On Holy Ground
    1. What were God's people anciently taught concerning the sacredness
of the sanctuary? Lev. 26:2.
    2. When God's people meet to worship Him,, who is in their midst,
though unseen? Matt. 18:20.
    3. How is this Unseen One to be regarded? Rev. 4:8-11.
    4. What does the awesome presence of God do? Ex. 3:1-6; Joshua 5:
14, 15.
                     Revelation of Heaven's Majesty
   5. How was His presence manifested in the sanctuary in the wilder-
ness? Ex. 40:33-35.
   6. How was His presence revealed when Solomon's temple was dedi-
cated? 2 Chron. 5:13, 14.
                                         [ 5]
    No-rE.—We may learn how Christians should regard the place where God
meets with His people from the sacredness which was attached to the worship
of the earthly sanctuary. In the days of Israel the sanctuary was in very
truth the dwelling place of God. The Israelites were commanded not to ap-
proach that sacred place without preparation of soul and body for coming
into their Maker's presence. Garments and persons were to be made clean;
sin was to be confessed; everything possible was to be done that the worshiper
might come into God's presence without condemnation. In these days there
has come about a great change, not for the better but for the worse. Sacred
things which connect us with God are too lightly regarded. Reverence for
God and His sanctuary has largely passed away; nevertheless, God has given
instruction regarding the sacredness of His temple, the place where He meets
with His people. He has exalted His sanctuary above everything temporal
and those who truly love Him will so regard it.
    7. Wbat indictment against spiritual leaders of ancient Israel is noted
by the prophet Ezekiel? Ezek. 22:26.
    8. What titles of Christ's show how He is to be revered? Rev. 19:16;
17:14. Compare Matt. 5:34, 35.
    9. When Jesus was entering Jerusalem, how was He received? Luke
19 : 35-38.
                    Attitude of . Worship and Praise
      10. What manifestation is recorded of reverence on the part of the
  angels who stand in the presence of God? Isa. 6:1-4.
      NOTE.—The following rules concerning attendance at church give an ex-
  cellent picture of the way we should approach God's sanctuary, and enter
  into the spirit of true worship therein.
      "1. Go early to church. Not only be punctual, but be in your place before
  the hour announced for the service to begin.
      "2. Go in a reverent spirit. On the way remember whither you go. Avoid
  lightness of manner and conversation on worldly topics.
      "3. Before you enter and as you enter the church breathe a silent prayer
  of invocation for the influence of the Holy Spirit.
      "4. As you take your place, bow your head reverently in prayer for your-
  self and for all others who enter the sanctuary.
      "5. Resolve that you will foster no thought, fix your eyes on no object,
  utter no word, that will tend to divert your mind from the holy purpose for
  which you have come into this place.
      "6. As the minister enters the pulpit, offer an earnest, silent prayer in
• his behalf.
      "7. In all the service take an active part, as hearer, as worshiper."—Bishop
 Vincent.
     8. "When the benediction is pronounced, all should be quiet, as if fearful
 of losing the peace of Christ. Let all pass out without jostling. . . . Let there
 be no stopping in the aisles to visit . . . that others cannot pass out. The
 precincts of the church should be invested with a sacred reverence. It should
 not be made a place to meet old friends, and visit and introduce common
 thoughts."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 494.
     We are told that "the whispering and laughing and talking which might
 be without sin in a common business place, should find no sanction in the
 house where God is worshiped. The mind should be prepared to hear the word
 of God, that it may have due weight, and suitably impress the heart."—Id., vol.
5, p. 492.
                                       I6 ]
    11. When we enter God's presence in His earthly sanctuary, how should
we prepare to receive Him? Ps. 96:8, 9.
    NorE.—When one enters the place dedicated to the worship of the High
and Holy One, he enters the presence of the Divine Being. God Himself is
present according to His promise. In quietness and reverence we should ap-
pear before Him. When human beings come into the presence of their earthly
sovereigns, it is done after careful preparation. In dress, in every bodily ap-
pointment, they must appear at their best, and so prepare. They are schooled
as to how they will deport themselves, as to what they will say and do from
the moment of entering the royal presence until the moment of departure.
Likewise the worshiper who comes into the presence of God to do Him honor,
will both in his outward adorning and his inner spirit show his recognition of
the Majesty of heaven. No untidiness or uncleanliness of apparel or of person,
no consciousness of the stain of sin, will be upon him who enters the presence
of his God.
    12. What instruction is given to believers concerning modesty of ap-
parel? 1 Tim. 2:8-10; 1 Peter 3:3, 4.
    NOTE.—To center the attention upon the One worshiped, is the objective
of the hours of public service in the Christian church. All that would direct
the attention of the worshipers to one another should be avoided. Self should
be forgotten. The dress, the carriage, the person of ,those who appear before
God, should be banished from the thoughts of every worshiper. To make
this possible the dress of each member of the congregation should be neat,
plain, simple, without that outward adorning which attracts attention and
detracts from the spirit of true reverence. The display of dress so often seen
in the congregation of professed Christians is a species of idolatry. To attract
the least attention is a standard toward which every worshiper should aim.
What is worn should be neither too showy nor too austere nor too strange. It
is a dishonor to God's presence to seek by our attire to draw attention to our-
selves.


                     Lesson 3, for October 17, 1942
                                  Obedience
    MEMORY VERSE: "Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken
than the fat of rams." 1 Sam. 15:22, last part.
    STUDY HELPS: "Christ's Object Lessons," pages 272-283 (new ed., pages
273-285) ; "Prophets and Kings," pages 293-300.
    SEED THOUGHT: "Because men have received great light, because they have,
like the princes of Israel, ascended to the mount, and been privileged to have com-
munion with God, and to dwell in the light of His glory, let them not flatter themselves
that they can afterward sin with impunity; that because they have been thus honored,
God will not be strict to punish their iniquity. This is a fatal deception. The great
light and privileges bestowed, require returns of virtue and holiness corresponding to
the light given. Anything short of this, God cannot accept. Great blessings or privi-
leges should never lull to security or carelessness. They should never give license to
sin, or cause the recipients to feel that God will not be exact with them. All the ad-
vantages which God has given, are His means to throw ardor into the spirit, zeal into
effort, and vigor into the carrying out of His holy will."—"Patriarchs and Prophets,"
pages 359, 360.
                 Blessings Following Obedience
    1. How important in the eyes of the Lord is obedience? 1 Sam. 15:22.
                                          [71
    NOTE.—The importance of obedience as a requisite to salvation is very
definitely emphasized in Hebrews 5:7-9. Christ Himself being "made perfect"
through suffering, "obedient unto death," became the "author of eternal
salvation unto all them that obey Him." See Phil. 2:5-8.
    2. What encouraging promise is made to the obedient? Isa. 1:19.
   .3. What great promise was made by the Lord to ancient Israel if they
would, be an obedient people? Deut. 11:22-27.
    4. To what does the Lord liken those who obey His words? Matt. 7:
24, 25.
    NorE.—"Christ set forth the principles of His kingdom, and showed them
to be the great rule of life. To impress the lesson He adds an illustration. It
is not enough, He says, for you to hear My words. By obedience you must
make them the foundation of your character. Self is but shifting sand. If
you build upon human theories and inventions, your house will fall. By the
winds of temptation, the tempests of trial, it will be swept away. But these
principles that I have given will endure. Receive Me; build on My words."—
The Desire of Ages, page 314.
    5. What is said concerning the blessed results of the obedience of Jesus?
Rom. 5:19.
                 The. Standard of God's Government
    6. What is.the terrible consequence of man's disobedience? Isa. 24:4-6.
    NorE.--Speaking of the terrible conditions which will afflict the world
because of the machinations of the enemy of all righteousness near the end of
time, we are told: "While appearing to the children of men as a great phy-
sician who can heal all their maladies, he will bring disease and disaster, until
populous cities are reduced to ruin and desolation. Even now he is at work.
In accidents and calamities by sea and by land, in great conflagrations, in
fierce tornadoes and terrific hailstorms, in tempests, floods, cyclones, tidal
waves, and earthquakes, in every place and in a thousand forms, Satan is
exercising his power. He sweeps away the ripening harvest, and famine and
distress follow. He imparts to the air a deadly taint, and thousands perish by
the pestilence. These visitations are to become more and more frequent and
disastrous. Destruction will be upon both man and beast. 'The earth mourneth
and fadeth away,' the haughty people . . . do languish. The earth also is
defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because they have transgressed the
laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant.' "—The Great
Controversy, pages 589,590.
    7. How do we know that acts of obedience, and not mere promises, are
necessary? Matt. 21:28-31.
    8. What is the moral standard of obedience? James 2:8-12. Compare
1 John 3:4; Eccl. 12:13.
    9. How only can we be found obedient to the requirements of the Lord?
Rom. 8:3, 4.
    NOTE.—"In the new birth the heart is brought into harmony with God,
as it is brought into accord with His law. When this mighty change has taken
place in the sinner, he has passed from death unto life, from sin unto holiness,
from transgression and rebellion to obedience and loyalty. The old life of
alienation from God has ended; the new life of reconciliation, of faith and
love, has begun. Then 'the righteousness of the law' will 'be fulfilled in us,
                                      [8]
who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.' And the language of the
soul will be, '0 how love I Thy law ! it is my meditation all the day.' "—The
Great Controversy, page 468.
   10. To what extent is the indwelling presence of Christ, through the
Spirit, able to bring us into obedience? 2 Cor. 10:3-5.
                            Standing the Test
     11. What great test came to Abraham concerning his son Isaac? Gen.
22:1, 2.
    NorE.—At the time of this command to offer up his son as a sacrifice, Isaac
was about twenty and Abraham one hundred twenty years old. Read "Pa-
triarchs and Prophets," pages 148-155.
     12. What promise had been made concerning'Isaac? Gen. 17:19.
     13. What did Abraham do in response to the instruction he received?
Gen. 22:3-6.
     14. What did Isaac say? What was Abraham's reply? Verses 7, 8.
     15. How far did Abraham go in obeying the command of God? Who
spoke to him? What did the angel say? Verses 9-12.
     NOTE.—"Heavenly beings were witnesses of the scene as the faith of Abra-
 ham and the submission of Isaac were tested. The trial was far more severe
 than that which had been brought upon Adam. Compliance with the prohibi-
 tion laid upon our first parents involved no suffering; but the command to
 Abraham demanded the most agonizing sacrifice. All heaven beheld with
 wonder and admiration Abraham's unfaltering obedience. All heaven ap-
 plauded his fidelity. Satan's accusations were shown to be false. God de-
 clared to His servant, Now I know that thou fearest God [notwithstanding
 Satan's charges], seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from
 Me.' God's covenant, confirmed to Abraham by an oath before the intelli-
 gences of other worlds, testified that obedience will be rewarded."—Patriarchs
 and Prophets, page 155.
     16. What substitute was provided by the Lord? Verse 13.
     NOTE.—"It had been difficult even for the angels to grasp the mystery of
 redemption,—to comprehend that the Commander of heaven, the Son of
 God, must die for guilty man. When the command was given to Abraham to
 offer up his son, the interest of all heavenly beings was enlisted. With intense
 earnestness they watched each step in the fulfillment of this command. When
 to Isaac's question, 'Where is the lamb for a burnt offering?' Abraham made
 answer, 'God will provide Himself a lamb ;' and when the father's hand was
 stayed as he was about to slay his son, and the ram which God had provided
 was offered in the place of Isaac,—then light was shed upon the mystery of
 redemption, and even the angels understood more clearly the wonderful pro-
 vision that God had made for man's salvation."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
 page 155.
     17. Because of his obedience, what promise was made to Abraham?
  Verses 15-18. Compare Gen. 26:2-5.

                     Lesson 4, for October 24, 1942
                            Christian Living
    MEMORY VERSE: "I am the vine, ye are the branches. He that abideth in
Me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit; for without Me ye can do
nothing." John 15:5.
    STUDY HELPS: "Steps to Christ," pages 71-80; "Christ's Object Lessons,"
pages 62-69 (new ed., pages 61-68) ; "Testimonies to Ministers," pages 16-19.
    SEED THOUGHT: "It is not enough for us to believe that Jesus is not an im-
poster, and that the religion of the Bible is no cunningly devised fable. We may be-
lieve that the name of Jesus is the only name under heaven whereby man may be
saved, and yet we may not through faith make Him our personal Saviour. It is not
enough to believe the theory of truth. It is not enough to make a profession of faith
in Christ and have our names registered on the church roll. 'He that keepeth Hii
commandments dwelleth in Him, and He in him. And hereby we know that He
abideth in us, by the Spirit which He bath given us.' Hereby we do know that we
know Him, if we keep His commandments.' This is the genuine evidence of con-
version. Whatever our profession, it amounts to nothing unless Christ is revealed in,
works of righteousness."—"Christ's Object Lessons," pages 312, 313.

                           Growing Into Christ
     1. What is expected of those who are newly born in Christ? 1 Peter 2:2.
     2. What will be the result of true Christian growth? Eph. 4:15.
    NOTE.—"The change of heart by which we become children of God is in
the Bible spoken of as birth. Again, it is compared to the germination of the
good seed sown by the husbandman. In like manner those who are just con-
verted to Christ are, as 'newborn babes,' to 'grow up' to the stature of men
and women in Christ Jesus. Or like the good seed sown in the field, they are to
grow up and bring forth fruit."—Steps to Christ, page 71.
    3. To what are growing children of God likened? Isa. 61:3, last part.
    4. How did Jesus illustrate the relation between Him and His disciples?
John 15:4, 5.
    NOTE.—"You are just as dependent upon Christ, in order to live a holy
life, as is the branch upon the parent stock for growth and fruitfulness. Apart
from Him you have no life. You have no power to resist temptation or to
grow in grace and holiness. Abiding in Him, you may flourish. Drawing your
life from Him, you will not wither nor be fruitless. You will be like a tree
planted by the rivers of water."—Steps to Christ, page 73.
    5. What is said of those who are not united to Christ? John 15:5, last
part, margin.
                     Fruitage of Christian Growth
    6. What may Christ rightfully expect of every true disciple? Matt.
7:16, 1.7, 20.
    7. What fruit should be manifest in the Christian life? Gal. 5:22, 23.
    NorE.—"Those who become new creatures in Christ Jesus will bring forth
the fruits of the Spirit, 'love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness,
faith, meekness, temperance.' They will no longer fashion themselves accord-
ing to the former lusts, but by the faith of the Son of God they will follow
in His steps, reflect His character, and purify themselves even as He is pure.
The things they once hated, they now love; and the things they once loved,
                                        [ 10 I
they hate. The proud and self-assertive become meek and lowly in heart. The
vain and supercilious become serious and unobtrusive. The drunken become
sober, and the profligate pure. The vain customs and fashions of the world
are laid aside. Christians will seek not the 'outward adorning,' but 'the hidden
man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a
meek and quiet spirit.' "—Steps to Christ, pages 62, 63.
    8. What rule of life, followed by Jesus, was the secret of His constant
victory? Ps. 16:8. Compare Acts 2:25.
                   True Rest in Christian Activity
    9. If we come to Christ, wholly submissive to Him, what does He prom-
ise? Matt. 11 :28,29.
    10. What will be the result of quiet resting in Christ? Isa. 30:15.
    NOTE.—"This rest is not found in inactivity; for in the Saviour's invita-
tion the promise of rest is united with the call to labor: `Take My yoke upon
you, . . . and ye shall find rest.' The heart that rests most fully upon Christ
will be most earnest and active in labor for Him."—Steps to Christ, pages
75, 76.
    11. If we abide in Christ, what will be the effect upon our lives? John
15:4.
    12. With Christ dwelling in our hearts, what will He work in us? Phil.
2:13.
    NoTE.—"If Christ is dwelling in our hearts, He will work in us 'both to
will and to do of His good pleasure.' We shall work as He worked; we shall
manifest the same spirit. And thus, loving Him and abiding in Him, we shall
 `grow up into Him in all things, which is the head, even Christ.'"—Steps to
Christ, page 80.
                             Into His Likeness
    13. If Christ abides within, of what may we be sure at His appearing?
1 John 3:2.
    14. What did Christ teach with regard to His own relationship to the
world's need? John 4:34; Luke 19:10.
    15. How did He express our relationship to such a life of service? John
17:18. Compare 1 Peter 2:21.
    NoTE.—"If you will go to work as Christ designs that His disciples shall,
and win souls for Him, you will feel the need of a deeper experience and a
greater knowledge in divine things, and will hunger and thirst after righteous-
ness. You will plead with God, and your faith will be strengthened, and your
soul will drink deeper draughts at the well of salvation. Encountering op-
position and trials will drive you to the Bible and to prayer. You will grow in
grace and the knowledge of Christ, and will develop a rich experience."—Steps
to Christ, page 84.
    16. What incentive is given to study the life of Christ? 1 John 4:17;
2 Cor. 3:18.
                                                                             4—
                     God gives birthdays, perhaps fourscore;

                     Lesson 5, for October 31, 1942
                         Tests of Discipleship
    MEMORY AVERSE: "Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature:
old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new." 2 Cor. 5:17.
    STUDY HELPS: "Steps to Christ," pages 61-70; "Testimonies," vol. 5, pp.
135-137.
    SEED THOUGHT: "Everyone who connects himself with the church makes in
that act a solemn vow to work for the interest of the church, and to hold that interest
above every worldly consideration. It is his work to preserve a living connection with
God, to engage with heart and soul in the great scheme of redemption, and to show,
in his life and character, the excellency of God's commandments in contrast with the
customs and precepts of the world. Every soul that has made a profession of Christ
has pledged himself to be all that it is possible for him to be as a spiritual worker, to
be active, zealous, and efficient in his Master's service. Christ expects every man to
do his duty; let this be the watchword throughout the ranks of His followers."—
"Testimonies," vol. 5, p. 460.
                          Born a New Creature
    1. What are we by nature? Eph. :1-3.
    2. How do we become children of God? Gal. 3:26; John 1:12; Eph. 2:8.
    3. In becoming sons of God, what change must be, wrought in us? 2 Cor. .
5:17; John 3:3, 5. Compare Matt. 18: 1-3.
    NorE.—"Through the power of Christ men and women have broken the
chains of sinful habit. They have renounced selfishness. The profane have
become reverent, the drunken sober, the profligate pure. Souls that have borne
the likeness of Satan have become transformed into the image of God. This
change is in itself the miracle of miracles. A change wrought by the Word, it
is one of the deepest mysteries of the Word. We cannot understand it; we can
only believe, as declared by the Scriptures, it is 'Christ in you, the hope of
glory.' "—The Acts of the Apostles, page 476.
                        Fruits Meet for the Master
    4. What have those who have been born of the Spirit done? Gal. 5:24.
   _5. With this crucifixion, what features of the old life are laid aside?
1 Peter 2:1; Col. 3:8, 9.
    6. To what is the regenerate man likened?. Ps. 1:3; Jer. 17:7, 8. Com-
pare John 15:8.
    7. Besides the "fruit of the Spirit" (Gal. 5:22, 23), what other Chris-
tian graces will be seen in the life?
    Answer.—Truthfulness, mercy, kindness, humility, meekness, forbearance,
a forgiving spirit. Col. 3:9-17.
    Also, honesty, diligence, generosity, purity of speech. Eph. 4:25-29.
    8. How may we be assured that we have passed from death to life?
1 John 3:14.
    NOTE.—Love of the brethren is one of the tests of discipleship. If we really
love, not some, but all the brethren, we are assured that our name is written in
the book of life. "He that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can
he love God whom he hath not seen?"
    9. What attitude will the Christian sustain toward one who may be his
enemy? Matt. 5:43-48.
                                         [ 12
                       Living Up to Our Profession
   ,10. What will be the result of cherishing an unforgiving spirit? Matt.
6:14, 15.
    NOTE.—"Jesus teaches that we can receive forgiveness from God only as we
forgive others. It is the love of God that draws us unto Him, and that love
cannot touch our hearts without creating love for our brethren."—Thoughts
From the Mount of Blessing, page 166. To cherish an unmerciful spirit toward
others, is to close the heart against the mercy of God toward ourselves.
     11. Against what are believers warned? What exhortation is given?
2 Cor. 6:14-17.
     Nom—Being "unequally yoked together" has a very broad application.
No doubt it applies to worldly organizations, where Christians are bound by
the rules of a selfish, unsanctified body. From these it calls for a separation.
It covers also the marriage relation between believers and unbelievers. "The
marriage of Christians with the ungodly is forbidden in the Bible. The Lord's
direction is, 'Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers.' "—Patri-
archs and Prophets, page 175.
    "Let those who are contemplating marriage weigh every sentiment and
watch every development of character in the one with whom they think to
unite their life destiny. Let every step toward a marriage alliance be char-
acterized by modesty, simplicity, sincerity, and an earnest purpose to please
and honor God. Marriage affects the after-life, both in this world and in the
world to come. A sincere Christian will make no plans that God cannot ap-
prove."—The Ministry of Healing, page 359.
     12. How complete should be our separation from the world? 2 Cor. 7:1;
Matt. 6:24.
     Nors.—"The world is given up to self-indulgence. 'The lust of the flesh,
the lust of the eye, and the pride of life,' control the masses of the people. But
 Christ's followers have a holier calling. 'Come out from among them, and be
ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean.' In the light of God's
word we are justified in declaring that sanctification cannot be genuine which
 does not work this utter renunciation of the sinful pursuits and gratifications
 of the world."—The Great Controversy, page 475.
     13. What standard of life will be found in the children of God? 1 John
3:2, 3.
     NoTE.—The hope of seeing Jesus brings to the heart of every Christian the
 desire to be worthy of appearing in His presence. Hence the apostle writes
 that "every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as He is
 pure." This will be the experience of every soul that is received by Him, for we
 read of the church of Christ, that He will "present it to Himself a glorious
 church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be
 holy and without blemish." We are also told concerning the remnant church
 which is received of Christ at His coming: "they are without fault before the
 throne of God." The church of Christ will be burdened with longings for
 purity, for perfection. None but these will see Jesus as He is.
      14. Upon what will their affections be placed? Col. 3:2.
      15. In what way are they exhorted to do all things? Verse 17.
                                                                                4-

                     Lesson 6, for November 7, 1942
            The Ministry of the Holy Spirit—I
    MEMORY VERSE: "I will pray the Father, and He shall give you another
Comforter, that He may abide with you forever." John 14:16.
    STUDY HELPS: "Acts of the Apostles," pages 47-56; "Testimonies," vol. 8,
pp. 19-23.
    SEED THOUGHT: "The promise of the Holy Spirit is not limited to any age or
to any race. Christ declared that the divine influence of His Spirit was to be with
His followers unto the'end. From the Day of Pentecost to the present time, the Com-
forter has been sent to all who have yielded themselves fully to the Lord and to His serv-
ice. To all who have accepted Christ as a personal Saviour, the Holy Spirit has come as
a counselor, sanctifier, guide, and witness. The more closely believers have walked
with God, the more clearly and powerfully have they testified of their Redeemer's
love and of His saving grace. The men and women who through the long centuries
of persecution and trial enjoyed a large measure of the presence of the Spirit in their
lives, have stood as signs and wonders in the world. Before angels and men they have
revealed the transforming power of redeeming love."—"The Acts of the Apostles,"
page 49.
                       Another Comforter Promised
    1. Mile in the upper room, what statement concerning Himself did
Jesus make to His disciples which caused them sorrow? John 13:33-36.
    2. What promise did He give to comfort their troubled hearts? John
14:1-3.
    3. What further promise did Jesus make to them? Verses 16-18.
    NorE.—The word from which "Comforter" is translated is the Greek word
Paraclete. Five times this word is used in the New Testament, four times by
Jesus in the upper room discourse to the disciples (John 14:16, 26 ; 15:26 ;
16:7), where it refers to the person of the Holy Spirit, and once in 1 John 2:1,
where it refers to Christ. In 1 John 2:1, we read: "My little children, these
things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an ad-
vocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous." The word Paraclete,
translated "Comforter" in the other texts, is here translated "advocate," which
is perhaps a little nearer the original text, and refers to a personal Saviour.
The Holy Spirit is Christ's personal representative in the earth.
              Christ's Representative—Spirit of Truth
    4. What did Jesus say the Holy Spirit would do when He should come?
Verse 26. Compare Isa. 59:19.
    NoTE.—The word of God is the sword of the Spirit. Eph. 6:17. When we
pass through trial, the Spirit of God will bring to our minds the precious
promises of God, to strengthen us, and defeat the enemy. But in order that
the Spirit may do this we must by diligent study fill our minds with the word.
It was with the word that Jesus met the enemy in the temptation in the
wilderness.
    5. Of whom will the Spirit testify? John 15:26.
    6. What will be the effect of the working of the Holy Spirit? John 16:
7-11.
    Nor8.—The first evidence that the Lord has answered our prayers and sent
to us the Holy Spirit, is not a joyous, happy feeling, but a deep conviction of
sin. His first work is to convict of sin. And not until the sin is confessed and
put away, will He convince us of righteousness.
                                         [14 ]
    7. What will He do for the believer? Of whom will the Spirit not speak?
Verse 13.
    NOTE.—"Every worker who follows the example of Christ will be prepared
to receive and use the power that God has promised to His church for the
ripening of earth's harvest. Morning by morning, as the heralds of the gospel
kneel before the Lord and renew their vows of consecration to Him, He will
grant them the presence of His.Spirit, with its reviving, sanctifying power. As
they go forth to the day's duties, they have the assurance that the unseen
agency of the Holy Spirit enables them to be 'laborers together with God"'—
The Acts of the Apostles, page 56.
    8. After His resurrection, in what words did Jesus renew to the dis-
ciples the promise of the Holy Spirit? John 20:21, 22.
    9. Just before His ascension, what did He bid them do? Luke 24:49.
    NorE.—If an enduement of the Holy Spirit was necessary in order that the
disciples might do the work committed to their hands of carrying the gospel to
the world, it is equally necessary for His people in the closing work of God.
    10. Of what did He assure them on the day of His ascension? Acts 1:
4, 5.
                       The Outpouring on Pentecost
   11. When the disciples were in the upper room on the Day of Pentecost,
what was their spiritual condition? Acts 2:1.
   12. With what outward manifestations was the Holy Spirit bestowed
upon them? Verses 2-4.
   13. Because of the gift of tongues, what did every man hear? How
were the people affected? Verses 5-8. •
   14. Of what did Peter say this was a fulfillment? Verses 14-20.
           A Convicting Power and Harbinger of Unity
   15. How many were added to the church that day? Verse 41.
   16. Mat record is given of further accessions to the church? Acts 4:4;
5:14; 6:7.
   17. 'What spiritual condition resulted in the church? Acts 2:42-47;
4:32-35.


                    Lesson 7, for November 14, 1942
           The Ministry of the Holy Spirit—II
    MEMORY VERSE: "If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto
your children; how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to
them that ask Him?" Luke 11:13.
    STUDY HELPS: "The Great Controversy," pages 603-612 (new ed., pp. 681-691) ;
"Testimonies to Ministers," pages 506-512.
    SEED THOUGHT: "Christ has made provision that His church shall be a trans-
formed body, illumined with the light of heaven, possessing the glory of Immanuel. It
Is His purpose that every Christian shall be surrounded with a spiritual atmosphere
of light and peace. There is no limit to the usefulness of the one who, putting self aside,
makes room for the working of the Holy Spirit upon his heart, and lives a life wholly
consecrated to God."—"Testimonies," vol. 8, p. 19.
                                           [15 ]
                The Guiding and Convicting Agent
   1. To what power must we yield to be disciples of the Lord? Rom. 8:9,

     2. What does the apostle exhort in reference to our receiving the Holy
Spirit?- Eph. 5:18.
 - 3. How does Jesus illustrate God's willingness to give us the Holy
Spirit? Luke 11:13.
     4. What is the work of the Spirit everywhere in the world? Gen. 6:3;
Acts 2:37. Compare Acts 7:51; 9:5.
     NOTE.—"Those whom Christ commends in the judgment, may have known
little of theology, but they have cherished His principles. Through the influ-
ence of the divine Spirit they have been a blessing to those about them. Even
among the heathen are those who have cherished the spirit of kindness; before
the words of life had fallen upon their ears, they have befriended the mission-
aries, even ministering to them at the peril of their own lives. Among the
heathen are those who worship God ignorantly, those to whom the light is
never brought by human instrumentality, yet they will not perish. Though
ignorant of the written law of God, they have heard His voice speaking to
them in nature, and have done the things that the law required. Their works
are evidence that the Holy Spirit has touched their hearts, and they are rec-
ognized as the children of God.
     "How surprised and gladdened will be the lowly among the nations, and
among the heathen, to hear from the lips of the Saviour, 'Inasmuch as ye have
done it unto one of the least of these My brethren, ye have done it unto Me !'
How glad will be the heart of Infinite Love as His followers look up with
surprise and joy at His words of approval!"—The Desire of Ages, page 638.
             Conditions for Receiving the Holy Spirit
    5. How freely is the Spirit offered to us? John 7:37-39.
    6. To whom will the Spirit be given? Acts 5:32.
    NoTE.—"Christ has promised the gift of the Holy Spirit to His church,
and the promise belongs to us as much as to the first disciples. But like every
other promise, it is given on conditions. There are many who believe and pro-
fess to claim the Lord's promise; they talk about Christ and about the Holy
Spirit, yet receive no benefit. They do not surrender the soul to be guided and
controlled by the divine kagencies. We cannot use the Holy Spirit. The Spirit
is to use us. Through the Spirit God works in His people `to will and to do of
His good pleasure.' But many will not submit to this. They want to manage
themselves. This is why they do not receive the heavenly gift. Only to those
who wait humbly upon God, who watch for His guidance and grace, is the
Spirit given. The power of God awaits their demand and reception. This
promised blessing, claimed by faith, brings all other blessings in its train. It
is given according to the riches of the grace of Christ, and He is ready to supply
every soul according to the capacity to receive."—The Desire of Ages, page 672.
     7. What did Simon Magus desire? Acts 8:18, 19.
   8. What was Peter's reply? Verses 20-23.
   NoTE.—The motive of Simon Magus was wrong. If we desire the Spirit of
God for any selfish purpose, God must withhold it from us. Therefore, before
we can receive the fullness of the Holy Spirit, we must have the motives and
purposes of the heart right.
                                    [16 1
   9. Whom will the Spirit of God lead us to exalt? John 15:26; 16:14, 15.
   NOTE.—The     work of Satan is to exalt self. "I will ascend into heaven."
"I will exalt my throne." "I will be like the Most High." The Holy Spirit
never leads to an exaltation of self, but ever exalts the Saviour.
                          Operation of the Spirit
    10. What will be received when the Holy Spirit comes into the heart?
Acts 1 :8 ; Eph. 3:14-16.
    11. What great work did the Spirit of God do for King Saul? 1 Sam.
10:6, 10.
    12. Because of Saul's disobedience, what sad condition finally resulted?
1 Sam. 16:14.
    NorE.—Saul's experience in losing his contact with God because of his self-
ishness, pride, and rebellion, had many counterparts in the Old Testament
story. Among those which are outstanding is the experience of Samson (Judges
13:5, 24, 25; 14:6; 15:14; 16:18-21). When man has received richly from
God under the Holy Spirit's ministry and turns from it to seeking his own way,
the results are invariably disastrous to him, and react unfavorably upon all
who are associated with him.
    13. Against what are we warned? Eph. 4:29, 30; 1 Thess. 5:19.
    14. For what should we earnestly pray at this time? Zech. 10:1. Com-
pare Joel 2:23-27.
    NoTE.—"Why do we not hunger and thirst for the gift of the Spirit, since
this is the means by which we are to receive power? Why do we not talk of it,
pray for it; preach concerning it? The Lord is more willing to give the Holy
Spirit to us than parents are to give good gifts to their children. For the baptism
of the Spirit every worker should be pleading with God. Companies should be
gathered together to ask for special help, for heavenly wisdom, that they may
 know how to plan and execute wisely. Especially should men pray that God
 will baptize His missionaries with the Holy Spirit."—Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 22.



                    Lesson 8, for November 21, 1942
                Patience; Power of the Tongue
    MEMORY VERSE: "He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and
he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city." Prov. 16 :32.
    STUDY HELPS: "Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing," pages 17-33; "Tes-
timonies," vol. 5, pp. 56-59.
    SEED THOUGHT: "Life is disciplinary. While in the world, the Christian will
meet with adverse influences. There will be provocations to test the temper; and it
is by meeting these in a right spirit that the Christian graces are developed. If injuries
and insults are meekly borne, if insulting words are responded to by gentle answers,
and oppressive acts by kindness, this is evidence that the Spirit of Christ dwells in the
heart, that sap from the Living Vine is flowing to the branChes. We are in the school
of Christ in this life, where we are to learn to be meek and lowly of heart; and in the
day of final accounts we shall see that all the obstacles we meet, all the hardships and
annoyances that we are called to bear, are practical lessons in the application of prin-
ciples of Christian life. If well endured, they develop the Christlike in the character,
and distinguish the Christian from the worldling."—"Testimonies," vol. 5, p. 344.

                      The Power of Self-Control
   1. What is the greatest victory any person can ever achieve? Prov. 16:
32; 14:29. Compare Prov. 25:28.
    2. What is said concerning those who speak impatient, hasty words?
Prov. 29:20; Eccl. 7:9.
    NOTE.—He who fails to control his words and temper is a slave to Satan.
We must subdue our hasty tempers and control our words if we are to be vic-
torious in Christ. And in the abiding presence of Christ there is power to over-
come every evil trait of character. Every jangling, unpleasant, impatient, or
fretful word is an offering to the enemy of souls. Moreover such an offering
to the enemy of the soul is a costly thing, destroying peace in the heart, in the
family, in the community. Permitted to continue it will eventually rob the
one in whom it appears of eternal life.
    3. What caution is given in the word regarding fretfulness? Ps. 37:8.
    NorE.—The American Revised Version reads, "Fret not thyself, it tendeth
only to evil-doing." "It is the worst phase of selfishness to fret and censure
and complain because you have the power to do this, and those whom you
abuse in this way cannot prevent you. It is selfishness that causes variance in
the family circle and in the church. Unchristian hearts will think they can
discern great wrongs in others where none exist, and will dwell upon little
matters until they appear greatly magnified. . . . When Christ is in the
heart it will be so softened and subdued by love for God and man that fretting,
faultfinding, and contention will not exist there. The religion of Christ in the
heart will gain for its possessor a complete victory over those passions that
are seeking for the mastery."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 610.
    4. What is said regarding those who do not control their tongues?
James 1:26.
    5. What vow did David make in reference to his words? Ps. 39 : 1.

                    Evils of an Unbridled Tongue
     6. For what will each one be called to account? Matt. 12:36, 37. Why?
Verse 34.
    NorE.—"It is remarkable that our divine Master, in telling us of the com-
ing judgment, makes the final destiny of all men to depend upon whether in
this world they have exercised or have not exercised the grace of kindness. For
we are not done with life as we live it. We shall meet it all again, not only the
great things we do, but the little things. Even our lightest words take their
place among the fixed things of life, and will be recalled in the judgment. Je-
sus said, 'Every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof
in the day of judgment.' He does not say every wrong or evil word, but every
useless, purposeless, or frivolous word. The meaning is that the smallest things
in life, both the evil and the good, will be taken account of in the judgment."
—The Beauty of Kindness, pages 9, 10.
   7. If able to control the tongue, what else are we able to do? James 3: 2.
   8. What evil is in the power of an unruly tongue? Verses 4-6.
   9. By what comparison is the difficulty of controlling the tongue pre-
sented? Verses 7, 8.

              Enabling Strength to Minister Grace
   10. What power is promised to keep us patient in time of temptation?
Col. 1:9, 11.
      11. What kind of words are commended? Prov. 15:1, 2. Compare Prov.
31:26.
     NorE.—"Nothing else we can do is more worth-while than kindness. There
 is nothing that the world needs more, and nothing else that leaves more real
 and far-reaching good in human lives. Some day we shall learn that the little
  deeds of love wrought unconsciously, as we pass on our way, are greater in
  their helpfulness, and will shine more brightly at the last, than the deeds of
 renown which we think of as alone making a life great."
     "Turgenev in one of his little parables tells of meeting on the way a beggar,
  who held out his greasy hand for alms. Turgenev searched all his pockets, but
  had no money, no food, nothing whatever, to give the man. He said to him, 'I
 am sorry, brother, that I have nothing for thee.' The beggar's face brightened,
  and he said: 'That is enough. Thank you' To be called 'brother' was better
  than any alms would have been."—The Beauty of Kindness, page 28.
      12. What manner of conversation should characterize Christians? Eph.
' 4:29; Col. 4:6.
      13. What kind of speech should never be indulged in? Eph. 5:3, 4.
      NorE.—The professing Christian often wounds the cause of his God by
  lightness, joking, and trifling conversation. Christians should be humble peo-
  ple. Childlike faith and simplicity should be dominating traits of character.
  There should be a humbling of the heart before God that He may control the
  mind, the life, and the conversation of His children on all occasions, and under
  every circumstance. Thus controlled by His Spirit the life will tell for the up-
  building of His kingdom.
      14. What is written concerning the 144,000? Rev. 14:5.
    15. What example of patience is revealed in the life of our Saviour?
1 Peter 2:21-23.


                    Lesson 9, for November 28, 1942
                        Christian Temperance
     MEMORY VERSE: "Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do,
 do all to the glory of God." 1 Cor. 10:31.
     STUDY HELPS: "Prophets and Kings," pages 479-490; "Ministry of Healing,"
 pages 295-310.
     SEED THOUGHT: "The Saviour presents to us something higher to toil for
 than merely what we shall eat and drink, and wherewithal we shall be clothed. Eating,
 drinking, and dressing are carried to such excess that they become crimes. They are
 among the marked sins of the last days, and constitute a sign of Christ's soon coming.
 Time, money, and strength, which belong to the Lord, but which He has entrusted to
 us, are wasted in superfluities of dress and luxuries for the perverted appetite, which
 lessen vitality, and bring suffering and decay. It is impossible to present our bodies
 a living sacrifice to God when we continually fill them with corruption and disease
 by our own sinful indulgence. Knowledge must be gained in regard to how to eat and
 drink and dress so as to preserve health. Sickness is the result of violating nature's
 law. Our first duty, one which we owe to God, to ourselves, and to our fellow men,
 is to obey the laws of God. These include the laws of health."—"Counsels on Health,"
 pages 24, 25.

                        Striving for the Mastery
    1. What exhortation is given to those who seek an incorruptible crown?
1 Cor. 9:24, 25.
    NorE.—This is a most comprehensive text. To be temperate in all things
includes more than reforms in a few articles of food. The American Revised
Version instead of the word "temperate" has, the word "self-control." The
same rendering is given also in Acts 24:25; Gal. 5:23; 2 Peter 1:6; Titus 1:8.
This expresses the true idea of temperance. It is to be self-restrained, con-
tinent in all things. True temperance includes the entire life. Some may be
temperate or self-controlled in one or two particulars, yet very intemperate or
self-gratifying in other directions. To be temperate in "all things," includes
temperance in eating and drinking, in labor, both mental and physical, in
recreation—in fact in everything which goes to make up the life.
     2. What must constantly be kept in subjection by the Christian? Why?
Verse 27.
     3. What wish did John.express concerning one of his beloved ones in
the gospel? 3 John 2.
     4. What does the body of the Christian believer become? To whom do
we belong? Therefore what should we seek to do? 1 Cor. 6:19, 20.
    NoTE.—"All should have an intelligent knowledge of the human frame,
that they may keep their bodies in the condition necessary to do the work of
the Lord. The physical life is to be carefully preserved and developed, that
through humanity the divine nature may be revealed in its fullness. The rela-
tion of the physical organism to the spiritual life is one of the most important
branches of education. It should receive careful attention in the home and in
the school. All need to become acquainted with their physical structure and
the laws that control natural life. He who remains in willing ignorance of the
laws of his physical being, and who violates them through ignorance, is sinning
against God. All should place themselves in the best possible relation to life
and health. Our habits should be brought under the control of a mind that is
itself under the control of God."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 348.
    5. What follows in case we willfully defile the body temple? 1 Cor. 3:
16, 17.
                      Living to the Glory of God
   6. In the beginning what was given man for food? Gen. 1:29.
    7. What guiding principles should govern eating? Eccl. 10:17; 1 Cor.
10:31; Rom. 14:17.
    NorE.—In eating and drinking, as in every relationship of life, we 'should
be governed by the principle of glorifying God. Those who advocate healthful
principles of living should themselves set the example in what is placed upon
their own tables. Moreover, they should endeavor so to understand the proper
diet for health that they may be able by their example and practice to instruct
others. Simple, healthful, life-sustaining foods are available to all. These are
found in abundance in the vegetable kingdom, and are available in practically
every land where man is willing to work to bring them into production. They
can be prepared for eating in the home, by the careful, painstaking homemaker,
in such form as to sustain and enrich the living of all. To learn how to provide,
and how to prepare these foods for health and strength is the duty of the mem-
bers of the household.
                                     [ 20 ]
    8. What three things did Jesus mention as liable to prevent people
from being prepared to meet Him at His coming? Luke 21:34.
    IsiorE.—"Surfeit—To feed so as to oppress the stomach and derange the
functions of the system; to overfeed, and produce satiety, sickness, or uneasi-
ness; excess in eating and drinking."—Webster.
    "Overeating, even of the most wholesome food, is to be guarded against.
Nature can use no more than is required for building up the various organs of
the body, and excess clogs the system." "Attention should be given also to the
proper combination of foods. By brainworkers and others of sedentary pur-
suits, but few kinds should be taken at a meal."—Education, page 205.
    9. What food did God provide for His people in the wilderness? Ps.
78:23-25.
    NOTE.—" 'Man did eat angels' food,'—that is, food provided for them by
the angels."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 297.
    10. How did the children of Israel show their dissatisfaction with God's
daily provision? 1 Cor. 10:4-10.
    NorE.—Extremes in diet are dangerous. Where a narrow view of the
healthful preparation of food is held, all too often an impoverished diet is the
result. The body needs a balanced, life-sustaining diet, if health and strength
are to be maintained. Neither will the Christian lust after the highly seasoned,
overrich, and tasty foods which pander largely to the lusts of the appetite.
The diet may be Spartan, but life-sustaining. Neither too meager, nor too
full; neither unbalanced by the lack of essential elements, nor by an over-
abundance of those elements that are needed for the maintaining of life. The
experience of Israel of old is written to help us to understand the need for
study of our physical as of our spiritual needs, and to lead us to ascertain, each
for himself, how best he can eat and drink to the glory of God.
            Dangers of Intemperance; Christ's Example
    11. In Peter's list of Christian virtues, name those which precede and
those which follow temperance. 2 Peter 1:5-7.
    NOTE.—Temperance, or self-control, is only one qualification of many that
go to make up a perfect Christian character. All these qualifications here men-
tioned by Peter blend into one symmetrical whole. Knowledge precedes tern-,
perance. Good judgment and sound sense are needed in wisely taking hold of
temperance principles. Then it becomes a powerful adjunct in rising to the
higher attainments of patience, godliness, brotherly kindness, and love.
    12. What is contained in the wine cup? What warning is given concern-
ing wine? How does Solomon describe a drunkard's experience? From
what will drunkards be excluded? Prov. 23:29-32; 1 Cor. 6:10.
    13. Upon what special point did Jesus gain a complete victory? Luke
4:2-4.
    NoTE.—God expects of His children constant growth and development. An
indulged appetite is one of the greatest hindrances to mental improvement and
spiritual happiness. Many eat improperly: some gluttonously, some hastily,
some only of the things that taste good, pandering to a perverted appetite. In
many cases the pernicious habits were formed during a pampered childhood.
The indulgence of appetite is one of the most frequent causes of physical and
mental debility, resulting in feeble health and premature death. But there is
 power. in Christ to control a perverted appetite, to give wisdom to find the way
                                        21
of health. Let us seek that power, and study in this matter to show ourselves
workmen that need not be ashamed.
    14. For what purpose did Christ give Himself up for the church? Eph.
5:26, 27.


                    Lesson 10, for December 5, 1942
                         Tithes and Offerings
    MEMORY VERSE: "Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the
Most High." Ps. 50:14.
    STUDY HELPS: "Testimonies," vol 5, pp. 148-157; vol. 9, pp. 49-60, 245-256;
"Counsels on Stewardship," pages 65-81.
    SEED THOUGHT: "That which has been set apart according to the Scriptures
as belonging to the Lord, constitutes the revenue of the gospel, and is no longer ours.
It is no better than sacrilege for a man to take from God's treasury in order to serve
himself or to serve others in their secular business. Some have been at fault in divert-
ing from the altar of God that which has been especially dedicated to Him. All should
regard this matter in the right light. Let no one, when brought into a strait place,
take money consecrated to religious purposes, and use it for his own advantage, sooth-
ing his conscience by saying that he will repay it at some future time. Far better cut
down the expenses to correspond with the income, to restrict the wants and live within
the means, than to use the Lord's money for secular purposes."—"Gospel Workers,"
page 224.
                   Temptations in Striving for Riches
    1. Into what do those fall who choose to be rich? What is said of the
love of money? What exhortation is given the man of God? 1 Tim. 6:9-11
(See American Revised Version).
    NOTE.—The love of money has its root in covetousness. Covetousness un-
derlies all evil. It was Lucifer's coveting the place occupied by God that led
him into sin. He coveted the worship, the honor, the power belonging to the
Creator. Those who will be rich, those who bend every power of their being
to acquire the possession of money, fall into hurtful lusts which drown men in
perdition. This is an age of the world when this one thing has well-nigh be-
come the overmastering ambition. Colossal fortunes are amassed only to
become a curse to the possessor, to drag the soul down to perdition. From all
this God seeks to deliver His children.
     2. How much money is brought into the world at birth? How much can
be carried out? With what should we be content? Verses 7, 8.
    3. How does Heaven value contentment with godliness? Verse 6.
    4. What searching question of God must everyone sooner or later face
who selfishly lays up treasure for himself on earth? Luke 12:20, 21.
                           Claims God Has on Us
    5. How much of man's time does God claim as His own? How much of
his property? Ex. 20:8-11; Lev. 27:30.
    NOTE.—God's requirement of the Sabbath demands every seventh day of
time. In this requirement God has never changed. Likewise from earliest
times the tithe, one tenth of man's income or increase, is required by God in
acknowledgment of His ownership as the Creator and keeper of His people.
                                          22 )
     6.. What offense is charged against the one who appropriates God's
tithe to himself? Mal. 3: 8, 9.
     7. What command is transgressed in each case? Ex. 20:17 (the first
four words.)
    NorE.—It is plain that before one can take for himself God's holy time,
the seventh day, he must covet it. It is equally clear that this same command-
ment is also broken, as well as the eighth, before one can place with his own
stuff God's part, the tenth, made holy by His reservation for a sacred use.
    The great deceiver loves to make humanity drunk with the cares of this
life. He seeks to so change the affections of men that their hearts will be fixed
upon the things of earth instead of upon eternal things. Self-seeking, hoard-
ing of wealth, the accumulation of lands and property against evil times, are
set as the objective of self-seeking hearts. If the devil can persuade men that
these are of first importance, he builds up his own selfish interests and breaks
down the cause of righteousness and true godliness. Thus he causes men to
neglect their duty toward the work of God.
    8. Why is covetousness so offensive to God? Eph. 5:5. Contrast the un-
selfishness of God. Rom. 8:32.
    NorE.—God sacrificed the best that heaven had for man's salvation. To
the depth of heaven's love and kindness the heart of God was stirred. God
could not do more than He has done for mankind. What God requires of us
for whom He has done so much is but the slightest ripple on the surface of a
placid ocean. The never-ceasing tide of His great love surely demands our
faithfulness in that which He asks of us.
     9. Were all the tithe brought in, what would be the result? Mal. 3:10.
    NorE.—"If those to whom God's money has been entrusted will be faithful in
bringing the means lent them to the Lord's treasury, His work will make rapid
advancement. Many souls will be won to the cause of truth, and the day of
Christ's coming will be hastened."—Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 58.
     10. How does God sometimes arouse His people when they selfishly with-
hold means from His work? Haggai 1:9.
    NoTE.—There are many who claim that they are unable to do more than
they are now doing for the cause of God. Yet these same individuals do not
give according to their ability. God sometimes allows to come to these people
such losses that they realize on how little it is possible to live. He has reduced
their income in proportion to their willingness to give. God tests man's loyalty
in giving him great blessings. If man fails, God removes the blessings. All
that God gives us is intended as a means to the blessing of others. If it is
selfishly used upon ourselves, it is all too often withdrawn.
                     Fulfilling Promises and Vows
    11. At Bethel, what sacred vow did Jacob make to God? Gen. 28:20-22.
    NorE.—A vow or pledge to give the Lord certain things, made at times of
spiritual refreshing when the Holy Spirit moves the heart to benevolence, God
holds very sacred indeed. It cannot ruthlessly be set aside, nor later counted
as a light matter, without great peril to the soul.
    "Jacob was not here seeking to make terms with God. The Lord had al-
ready promised him prosperity, and this vow was the outflow of a heart filled
with gratitude for the assurance of God's love and mercy. Jacob felt that God
had claims upon him which he must acknowledge, and that the special tokens
                                      [231
of divine favor granted him demanded a return. So does every blessing be-
stowed upon us call for a response to the Author of all our mercies. . . .
    "'Of all that Thou shalt give me,' said Jacob, 'I will surely give the tenth
unto Thee.' Shall we who enjoy the full light and privileges of the gospel, be
content to give less to God than was given by those who lived in the former,
less favored dispensation? Nay, as the blessings we enjoy are greater, are not
our obligations correspondingly increased? But how small the estimate; how
vain the endeavor to measure with mathematical rules, time, money, and love,
against a love so immeasurable and a gift of such inconceivable worth. Tithes
for Christ 1 0, meager pittance, shameful recompense for that which cost so
much ! From the cross of Calvary, Christ calls for an unreserved consecra-
tion. All that we have, all that we are, should be devoted to God."—Patriarchs
and Prophets, pages 187,188.
    When Jacob after many years returned to his father's country, he did not
forget the vow to pay a tenth of his increase to the Lord. He faithfully dis-
charged his debt to his Master. He was a wealthy man. God had abundantly
blessed him. But this did not deter him from transferring what he had prom-
ised to the treasury of the Lord.
    Many in our day fail where Jacob was faithful. Those to whom God has
given most have the strongest inclination to hold what they have. The heart
that appreciates the goodness and mercy of God will be faithful, in little or in
much, to return to God His own.
    12. How did David regard his vows of consecration or duty? Ps. 61:5;
66 : 13,14.
    13. Should the payment of a vow be put off? What is preferable to
failure to pay? Eccl. 5:4-6.
    14. Upon whom does God command special blessings? Isa. 32:8; Prov.
11:25.

                   Lesson 11, for December 12, 1942
                The Ordinances of the Church
    MEMORY VERSE: "For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup,
ye do show the Lord's death till He come." 1 Cor. 11:26.
    STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pages 642-661.
    SEED THOUGHT: "The communion service points to Christ's second coming.
It was designed to keep this hope vivid in the minds of the disciples. Whenever they
met together to commemorate His death, they recounted how 'He took the cup, and
gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; for this is My blood of
the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins. But I say unto
you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink
it new with you in My Father's kingdom.' In their tribulation they found comfort
in the hope of their Lord's return. Unspeakably precious to them was the thought,
'As often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do show the Lord's death till
He come.' "—"The Desire of Ages," page 659.

                       Heaven's Mark of Greatness
    1. In coming into the world, what position did the Son of God volun-
tarily choose? Phil. 2:6,7.
    2. In His teaching, how did Jesus state this principle of His life?
Matt. 20:28.
                                        1 24 ]
    NOTE.—"In His life and lessons, Christ has given a perfect exemplification
of the unselfish ministry which has its origin in God. God does not live for
Himself. By creating the world, and by upholding all things, He is constantly
ministering for others. 'He maketh His sun to rise on the evil and on the good,
and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.' This ideal of ministry God
has committed to His Son. Jesus was given to stand at the head of humanity,
that by His example He might teach what it means to minister. His whole
life was under a law of service. He served all, ministered to all. Thus He
lived the law of God, and by His example showed how we are to obey it."—
The Desire of Ages, page 649.
    3. As viewed by the world, which is considered the greater, the one
ministering, or the one ministered to? Luke 22:27.
    4. As viewed by Heaven which class is regarded the greater? Matt. 20:
25-27; Luke 22:26.
    5. Instead of recognizing the true greatness of unselfish ministry for
others, for what were the disciples striving? Mark 9:33, 34; Luke 22:24.
    NoTE.—While unselfish ministry originated with God, self-seeking and
self-exaltation originated with Satan. Unconsciously, the disciples had imbibed
this worldly spirit; they strove among themselves which should be accounted
the greatest.
    "Many of their contentions for supremacy, much of their dissatisfaction
with Christ's methods, originated with Judas." "That which ruled him was
the hope of selfish benefit in the worldly kingdom which he expected Christ to
establish."—Education, pages 92, 91.
    6. Name some of the ways in which Jesus served the people. Matt 11:
2-6. Compare Acts 10:38.
                          A Lesson in Humility
    7. The night before Jesus was crucified, what ordinance did He institute
to keep before His followers this principle of unselfish service? John 13:3-5.
    8. What did Peter say? What was Jesus' reply? Verses 6-11.
    9. When Jesus sat down again, what did He say? Verses 12-15.
    NOTE.—It was more than the ordinance of feet washing Jesus was giving
the church. By this memorial He bequeathed His own spirit of loving ministry
to His followers. This was His answer for all time as to who should be the
greatest.
    "In the fate of Judas, they [his companions] saw the end to which self-serv-
ing tends. For these disciples the mission of Christ finally accomplished its pur-
pose. Little by little His example and His lessons of self-abnegation molded
their characters. His death destroyed their hope of worldly greatness. The
fall of Peter, the apostasy of Judas, their own failure in forsaking Christ in
His anguish and peril, swept away their self-sufficiency. They saw their own
weakness; they saw something of the greatness of the work committed to
them; they felt their need of their Master's guidance at every step."—Educa-
tion, pages 93,94.
    10. With what words did Jesus point out the true attitude His followers
should maintain? Verses 16, 17.
    NOTE.—"None should exclude themselves from the communion because
some who are unworthy may be present. Every disciple is called upon to par-
                                       [ 25 ]
ticipate publicly, and thus bear witness that he accepts Christ as a personal
Saviour. It is at these, His own appointments, that Christ meets His people,
and energizes them by His presence. Hearts and hands that are unworthy may
even administer the ordinance, yet Christ is there to minister to His children.
All who come with their faith fixed upon Him will be greatly blessed. All who
neglect these seasons of divine privilege will suffer loss. Of them it may ap-
propriately be said, 'Ye are not all clean.' "—The Desire of Ages, page 656.
                     Emblems and Their Meaning
    11. After washing His disciples' feet, what did Jesus do? John 13:12;
Matt. 26:26.
    12. As He gave them the cup, what did He say? Verses 27, 28.
    13. In eating the broken bread and drinking of the cup what is kept in
mind? How long is this memorial to be in force? 1 Cor. 11:26.
    IsToTE.—"At the first feast He attended with His disciples [John 2:1-11],
Jesus gave them the cup that symbolized His work for their salvation. At the
Last Supper He gave it again, in the institution of that sacred rite by which His
death was to be shown forth 'till He come.' "
    "The communion service points to Christ's second coming. It was de-
signed to keep this hope vivid in the minds of the disciples." "The wine which
Christ provided for the feast [at Cana], and that which He gave to the dis-
ciples as a symbol of His own blood, was the pure juice of the grape."—The
Desire of Ages, pages 149,659.
    The bread used in instituting the Lord's Supper was Passover bread. Of
this feast God commanded, "Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and
there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven
seen with thee in all thy quarters." Ex. 13:7. Leaven, or fermentation, rep-
resents sin. See 1 Cor. 5:7,8.
            Our Attitude Toward Christ's Redemption
    14. By what are we reconciled to God? By what saved? Rom. 5:10.
    15. What is the result when one partakes of this bread and wine not
discerning the body of Christ? 1 Cor. 11:27-29.
    NoTE.—"So that whosoever may be eating the loaf or drinking the cup of
the Lord in an unworthy manner, shall be responsible for the body and blood
of the Lord."—Rotherham's Transla tion.
    If one by faith discerns by these emblems his Lord dying on Calvary to
atone for his sins, having confessed them, he is not eating and drinking "un-
worthily," or in an unbecoming or irreverent manner.
    "Looking upon the crucified Redeemer, we more fully comprehend the
magnitude and meaning of the sacrifice made by the Majesty of heaven. The
plan of salvation is glorified before us, and the thought of Calvary awakens
living and sacred emotions in our hearts. Praise to God and the Lamb will be
in our hearts and on our lips; for pride and self-worship cannot flourish in
the soul that keeps fresh in memory the scenes of Calvary."—The Desire of
Ages, page 661.
    16. When will Jesus next drink of the fruit of the vine? Matt. 26:29.
    NOTE.—Jesus longs to have His people with Him. John 17:24. Spanning
the interval between this Last Supper with the disciples until that time when
all the hosts of the redeemed are gathered about His table in His kingdom,
Jesus declares that until that day He will not partake of the fruit of the vine.
                                     (26 ]
To Him, also, it would seem the emblem is very sacred, in that through it a
most solemn covenant relation is sustained between the redeemed and their
Redeemer. Precious Saviour ! Upon His heart constantly He bears His
tempted, struggling children.
   17. How did Jesus and the disciples conclude the holy service? Where •
did they go? Verse 30.


                   Lesson 12, for December 19, 1942
                                Consecration
   MEMORY VERSE.: "No man, having put his hand to the plow, and looking
back, is fit for the kingdom of God." Luke 9:62.
    STUDY HELPS: "Steps to Christ," pages 47-52; "Gospel Workers," pages
111-116.
    SEED THOUGHT: "All who consecrate soul, body, and spirit to God, will be
constantly receiving a new endowment of physical and mental power. The inexhaust-
ible supplies of heaven are at their command. Christ gives them the breath of His
own spirit, the life of His own life. The Holy Spirit puts forth its highest energies
to work in heart and mind. The grace of God enlarges and multiplies their faculties,
and every perfection of the divine nature comes to their assistance in the work of sav-
ing souls. Through co-operation with Christ they are complete in Him, and in their
human weakness they are enabled to do the deeds of Omnipotence."—"The Desire of
Ages," page 827.
                    The Response of a Willing Mind
    1. When David was preparing to build the temple, what question did
he ask the people? 1 Chron. 29:5.
    2. With what spirit did the leaders of the people respond? Verse 6.
    3. To whom did that which they gave really belong? Verses 10-14.
    NOTE.—"All that man receives of God's bounty still belongs to God. What-
ever God has bestowed in the valuable and beautiful things of earth, is placed
in the hands of men to test them,—to sound the depths of their love for Him
and their appreciation of His favors. Whether it be the treasures of wealth
or of intellect, they are to be laid, a willing offering, at the feet of Jesus; the
giver saying, meanwhile, with David, 'All things come of Thee, and of Thine
own have we given Thee' "—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 753.
    4. What complete consecration is set before us by the apostle Paul?
Rom. 12:1, 2.
    NorE.—Mind and body are to be yielded to God. All is to be laid on the
altar, not a dead but a living sacrifice. This is the Lord petitioning us to con-
secrate ourselves wholly to Him. The unyielding life is the citadel of self. This
fortress God will not force us to yield, yet nothing else will suffice for deliver-
ance. When once we give up all, making our consecration complete and un-
conditional, the Lord will flood the soul with the fullness of His blessing.
    5. How complete was the consecration of the churches of Macedonia?
2 Cor. 8:2-5.
    NoTE.—The gifts here mentioned came from poverty. We are told that
"Macedonia had lost the benefits of its mines, which the Roman government
had apportioned to itself, and was suffering from the weight of taxation." But
the joy of a new-found salvation was so great that they forgot their extreme
                                        r 27 1
poverty and gave liberally. But above all, they "gave their own selves to the
Lord." Herein lies the foundation of all liberality.
   6. How had Caleb followed the Lord? Num. 14:22-24.

                    Harvesting One's Own Sowing •
     7. How did the Lord illustrate the principle of stewardship? Matt. 25:
14, 15.
    NOTE.—"The talents that Christ entrusts to His church represent especially
the gifts and blessings imparted by the Holy Spirit. . . . But not until after
the ascension was the gift received in its fullness. Not until through faith and
prayer the disciples had surrendered themselves fully for His working, was
the outpouring of the Spirit received. Then in a special sense the goods of
heaven were committed to the followers of Christ. 'When He ascended up on
high, He led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.' Unto every one of
us is given grace, according to the measure of the gift of Christ,' the Spirit
`dividing to every man severally as He will.' The gifts are already ours in
Christ, but their actual possession depends upon our reception of the Spirit
of God. . . .
    "The special gifts of the Spirit are not the only talents represented in the
parable. It includes all gifts and endowments, whether original or acquired,
natural or spiritual. All are to be employed in Christ's service. In becoming
His disciples, we surrender ourselves to Him with all that we are and have.
These gifts He returns to us purified and ennobled, to be used for His glory
in blessing our fellow men.
    "To every man God has given 'according to his several ability.' The talents
are not apportioned capriciously. He who has ability to use five talents re-
ceives five. He who can improve but two, receives two. He who can wisely
use only one, receives one. None need lament that they have not received
larger gifts; for He who has apportioned to every man, is equally honored by
the improvement of each trust, whether it be great or small. The one to whom
five talents have been committed is to render the improvement of five; he who
has but one, the improvement of one. God expects returns 'according to that
a man bath, and not according to that he bath not.' "—Christ's Object Lessons,
pages 327, 328.
    8. What increase was given to those who consecrated these talents to
the Lord? What reward? Verses 16, 17, 20-23.
   9. What did the one do who had only one talent? Verse 18.
    10. What was the result of neglecting to consecrate to God the talent
given him? Verses 24-29.
    NorE.—"It was the one with the smallest gift who left his talent unim-
proved. In this is given a warning to all who feel that the smallness of their
endowments excuses them from service for Christ. If they could\do some great
thing, how gladly would they undertake it; but because they can serve only
in little things, they think themselves justified in doing nothing. In this they
err. The Lord in His distribution of gifts is testing character. The man who
neglected to improve his talent, proved himself an unfaithful servant. Had he
received five talents, he would have buried them as he buried the one. His mis-
use of the one talent showed that he despised the gifts of heaven."—Christ's
Object Lessons, page 355.

                  Complete Consecration Exemplified
    11. What consecration of earthly things does the Lord require? Luke
14:33.
    12. Besides consecration of earthly goods, what experience may entire
consecration include? What reward is promised to those who fulfill these
requirements? Mark 10:28-30.
    13. What answer did Jesus give to the lawyer who asked regarding the
greatest commandment in the law? Matt. 22:35-40.
    NOTE.—"Even the moral law fails of its purpose, unless it is understood in
its relation to the Saviour. Christ had repeatedly shown that His Father's
law contained something deeper than mere authoritative commands. In the
law is embodied the same principle that is revealed in the gospel. The law
points out man's duty and shows him his guilt. To Christ he must look for
pardon and for power to do what the law enjoins."—The Desire of Ages, page
608.


                   Lesson 13, for December 26, 1942
           The Rewards of Service With Christ
    MEMORY VERSE: "He said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no
man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the king-
dom of God's sake, who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in
the world to come life everlasting." Luke 18:29, 30.
    STUDY HELPS: "The Acts of the Apostles," pages 309-315; "Christ's Object
Lessons," pages 397-413.
    SEED THOUGHT: "There are men and women who have left all for Christ's
sake. Their own temporal interests, their own enjoyment of society and of family and
friends, are made of less importance than the interests of the kingdom of God. They
have not made houses and lands, and relatives and friends, however dear, first in their
affections, and God's cause second. And those who do this, who devote their lives to
the advancement of the truth, to bringing many sons and daughters to God, have the
promise that they shall have a hundredfold in this life, and in the world to come life
everlasting."—"Testimonies," vol. 5, p. 428.

                   God's Willingness to Bless
    1. On what commendable human experience did Christ base His state-
ment of God's willingness to bless His children? Matt. 7:11.
    2. How does Paul in his letter to Timothy speak of God's liberality?
1 Tim. 6:17, last part.
    3. What did the Saviour say would be the result if we leave all to fol-
low Him? Luke 18:29, 30.
    NOTE.—"Those who are the partakers of the grace of Christ will be ready
to make any sacrifice, that others for whom He died may share the heavenly
gift. They will do all they can to make the world better for their stay in it.
This spirit is the sure outgrowth of a soul truly converted. No sooner does one
come to Christ, than there is born in his heart a desire to make known to others
what a precious friend he has found in Jesus; the saving and sanctifying truth
cannot be shut up in his heart."—Steps to Christ, pages 82, 83.
    4. In presenting His own sacrifice in figure, what general principle did
Christ state concerning sacrificial service? John 12:24, 25.
                                         [ 29 ]
     5. What did Christ say concerning the results of service with Him?
Verse 26.
     6. In every hour of adversity and trial, how may comfort and courage be
found? Ps. 62:5-8.
    Nom—The psalmist places his expectation upon God. His hope and con-
fidence are resting wholly in Him. Thus it has been in the lives of God's saints
in all ages. No outward circumstances could discourage; no opposing forces
take away their faith. Daniel and his companions placed their confidence in
God; the ancient prophets, when rejected of Israel, rested their hope in the
Almighty. The apostles sent forth with the gospel, facing a hostile world and
death for their loyalty, kept their eyes upon their Redeemer, the hope of His
people. In the great missionary surge of the last century, faith in God's prom-
ises sent out to earth's darkest recesses an army of men who were willing to
serve with Christ even unto death. Thus Livingstone died upon his knees in
Central Africa; Gardiner, faced with starvation in barren Tierra del Fuego,
left behind a message of confidence and hope. Today the same confidence, the
same trust, are being expressed by a noble band of men and women in every
land who have not counted their lives dear. With David of old they say in
word and in deed, we "trust Him at all times." Be the service period long or
short, the battle brief and dangerous or long drawn and spirit testing, He is
their defense, and they stand unmoved.
  A Beautiful Example of Reward for Sacrifice and Service
    7. What vow did Hannah make in the days of ancient Israel? 1 Sam.
1:11.
    8. How was this vow fulfilled at Samuel's birth? Verse 28.
    9. What was the reward of faithful Hannah in this life? 1 Sam. 3:20;
25:1; 28:3.
    NorE.—Hannah's sacrifice was rewarded in seeing her first-born whom she
had dedicated in childhood to the service of God, made God's prophet to all
Israel (1 Sam. 3:20). At his death, after a life whose service was one of the
greatest holding forces in Israel's history, all Israel mourned his passing. Even
in his death, the influence of his life was a purging, purifying fire throughout
the nation (1 Sam. 28:3), so that the king turned to the putting away of evil
from the land. Truly Hannah had her reward here below, and in the life to
come the eternal reward awaits.
                    John the Forerunner of Christ
    10. In the announcement of Christ's appearing, what part was John
the Baptist to act? Matt. 3:3, 11, 13-17; Luke 3:15-17.
    11. What experience in the life of John seemed to be a contradiction of
God's promises? Matt. 4:12; Luke 3:20.
    12. How did Christ estimate John's position 'among earth's great
leaders? Luke 7:24-28.
    NorE.—"To many minds a deep mystery surrounds the fate of John the
Baptist. They question why he should have been left to languish and die in
prison. The mystery of this dark providence our human vision cannot pene-
trate; but it can never shake our confidence in God when we remember that
John was but a sharer in the sufferings of Christ. All who follow Christ will
wear the crown of sacrifice. They will surely be misunderstood by selfish men,
and will be made a mark for the fierce assaults of Satan. It is this principle of
self-sacrifice that his kingdom is established to destroy, and he will war against
it wherever manifested....
                                      [ 80 ]
   "Jesus did not interpose to deliver His servant. He knew that John would
bear the test. Gladly would the Saviour have come to John, to brighten the
dungeon gloom with His own presence. But He was not to place Himself in
the hands of enemies and imperil His own mission. Gladly would He have
delivered His faithful servant. But for the sake of thousands who in after
years must pass from prison to death, John was to drink the cup of martyrdom.
As the followers of Jesus should languish in lonely cells, or perish by the sword,
the rack, or the fagot, apparently forsaken by God and man, what a stay to
their hearts would be the thought that John the Baptist, to whose faithfulness
Christ Himself had borne witness, had passed through a similar experience."—
The Desire of Ages, pages 223,224.
                   Nothing Good Goes Unrewarded
    13. In what glowing words does Jesus set forth the rewards of loyalty
and faithfulness? Matt. 10:40-42.
    14. In this life what may the people of God expect? Yet what will be
the ultimate reward? Mark 10:29, 30.
    15. What promise of reward is made to those who are faithful unto
death? Rev. 2:10.
    16. What are the overcomers promised? Rev. 2:7, 11, 17, 25-28; 3:4, 5,
12, 21.
    NorE.—In writing to the seven churches Christ through the Revelator
makes many glorious promises to the overcomer. Among them are "to eat of
the tree of life," "not be hurt of the second death," "to eat of the hidden
manna," and to have "a new name" known only to the receiver, "power over
the nations," and the gift of "the morning star," "white raiment," and his
name confessed "before My Father, and before His angels," to be made "a
pillar in the temple of My God," "My new name," and "to sit with Me in My
throne." What a glorious, indescribable list of heavenly gifts are in store for
those who in complete consecration yield their lives in service with the Saviour
in behalf of fallen men. "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have en-
tered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them
that love Him." 1 Cor. 2:9.

             THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
                      December 26
S ABBATH school members everywhere should rejoice that they are given the
   opportunity this quarter to help further the work in the mission field of
Tanganyika, East Africa. We now have three thousand Sabbathkeepers in
this field, and the doors are open for the evangelical, the medical, and the
educational program to be carried on. The Thirteenth Sabbath overflow on
December 26 is to be used in helping to erect and equip a much-needed hospital
for the Tanganyika field. It is hoped that this Thirteenth Sabbath Offering
will be the largest ever contributed to our work in the Southern African Divi-
sion.
    The overflow for the fourth quarter of last year, given to the Southern
African Division, amounted to $13,009.94. Everyone should give liberally
this quarter of the means with which God has entrusted him that Tanganyika's
needs may be supplied.
