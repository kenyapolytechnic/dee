              This Individual-Sabbath School Offering Goal chart
           will appear in each Quarterly. Systematic giving week by
           week is becoming more and more a practice, and this
           chart is inserted by request. Many Sabbath school mem-
           bers are giving a dollar or more each week, and this goal
           chart will enable them to keep an accurate record of their
           covenant with God.

              "God has devised a plan by which all may give as He
           has prospered them, and which will make giving a habit
           without waiting for special calls. Those who can do this,
           but will not because of their selfishness, are robbing their
           Creator, who has bestowed upon them means to invest in
           His cause to advance its interests."—Testimonies, vol. 3,
           p.411.

        OUR SPIRITUAL RELATIONSHIPS
                       Lesson 1, for April 4, 1942
                          Reconciled to God
    MEMORY VERSE: "If, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by
the death of His Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by His life."
Rom. 5:10.
   STUDY HELP: "Steps to Christ," chapters, "God's Love for Man," and "The
Sinner's Need of Christ."
    SEED THOUGHT: "It is the work of conversion and sanctification to reconcile
men to God, by bringing them into accord with the principles of His law. In the begin-
ning, man was created in the image of God. He was in perfect harmony with the nature
and the law of God; the principles of righteousness were written upon his heart. But
sin alienated him from his Maker. He no longer reflected the divine image. His heart
was at war with the principles of God's law. 'The carnal mind is enmity against God:
for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.' But 'God so loved the
world, that He gave His only-begotten Son,' that man might be reconciled to God.
Through the merits of Christ he can be restored to harmony with his Maker. His heart
must be renewed by divine grace; he must have a new life from above. This change is
the new birth, without which, says Jesus, 'he cannot see the kingdom of God.' "—"The
Great Controversy," page 467.

                         In Rebellion Against God
    1. What is the condition of men by nature? How do they walk? What
are they called? Eph. 2:1-3.
    2. What relation do those subject to the carnal mind sustain to God?
What are some of their characteristics? Rom. 8: 6-8; Titus 3:3.
    NOTE —"Education, culture, the exercise of the will, human effort, all have
their proper sphere, but here they are powerless. They may produce an out-
ward correctness of behavior, but they cannot change the heart; they cannot
purify the springs of life. There must be a power working from within, a new
life from above, before men can be changed from sin to holiness. That power
is Christ. His grace alone can quicken the lifeless faculties of the soul, and
attract it to God, to holiness."—Steps to Christ, page 20.
    3. How does God describe the wretched state of those who are in re-
bellion against Him? Isa. 1:4-7.
     4. What is God's earnest desire for all? 2 Peter 3:9, last part; Ezek.
18:31, 32.
                    Changes Through Reconciliation
   5. By what specific act of Christ was it made possible for man to be
brought into harmony with God? Rom. 5:10.
   6. When the sinner accepts God's love, what change takes place? Isa.
1:18.
                                  [
    7. By whom and by what means is this great transaction accomplished?
Titus 3:5, 6.
    NoTE.—"The broken law of God demanded the life of the sinner. In all
the universe there was but one who could, in behalf of man, satisfy its claims.
Since the divine law is as sacred as God Himself, only one equal with God
could make atonement for its transgression. None but Christ could redeem
fallen man from the curse of the law, and bring him again into harmony with
Heaven."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 63.
    8. Since the penalty for the violation of God's law is death, how may
the penalty be removed from the sinner? Rom. 6:23; 1 Peter 2:24.
    9. Contrast man's condition before and after reconciliation. 1 John
5:12; Rom. 8:1.
    10. What is God's purpose for the sons of men? 2 Tim. 1:9, 10; Jer.
29:11.
    Nors.—"Before the foundations of the earth were laid, the Father and the
Son had united in a covenant to redeem man if he should be overcome by
Satan. They had clasped their hands in a solemn pledge that Christ should
become the surety for the human race. This pledge Christ has fulfilled. When
upon the cross He cried out, 'It is finished,' He addressed the Father. The
compact had been fully carried out. Now He declares, Father, it is finished. I
have done Thy will, 0 My God. I have completed the work of redemption. If
Thy justice is satisfied, 'I will that they also, whom Thou hast given Me, be
with Me where I am.' "—The Desire of Ages, page 834.
    11. How much is embraced in God's purpose for man? Eph. 1:4-12.
    NOTE.—"Christ assured the angels that by His death He would ransom
many, and would destroy him who had the power of death. He would recover
the kingdom which man had lost by transgression, and the redeemed were to in-
herit it with Him, and dwell therein forever. Sin and sinners would be blotted
out, nevermore to disturb the peace of heaven or earth. He bade the angelic
host to be in accord with the plan that His Father had accepted, and rejoice
that, through His death, fallen man could be reconciled to God.
    "Then joy, inexpressible joy, filled heaven. The glory and blessedness of
a world redeemed, outmeasured even the anguish and sacrifice of the Prince of
life. Through the celestial courts echoed the first strains of that song which
was to ring out above the hills of Bethlehem,—`Glory to God in the highest,
and on earth peace, good will toward men.' With a deeper gladness now than
in the rapture of the new creation, 'the morning stars sang together, and all
the sons of God shouted for joy.' "—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 65.

                      Evidences of Reconciliation
    12. What should be the daily experience of those who have been rec-
onciled to God? Rom. 5:1, 2; 2 Peter 1:4-8.
    13. Whose peace do those reconciled to God have? To what is it com-
pared? John 14:27; Isa. 48:18.
    NOTE.—"Inward peace and a conscience void of offense toward God, will
quicken and invigorate the intellect, like dew distilled upon the tender plants.
The will is then rightly directed and controlled, and is more decided, and yet
free from perverseness. The meditations are pleasing because they are sanc-
                                      I4
tified. The serenity of mind which you may possess, will bless all with whom
you associate. This peace and calmness will, in time, become natural, and will
reflect its precious rays upon all around you, to be again reflected upon you.
The more you taste this heavenly peace and quietude of mind, the more it
will increase. It is an animated, living pleasure which does not throw all the
moral energies into a stupor, but awakens them to increased activity. Perfect
peace is an attribute of heaven which angels possess. May God help you to
become a possessor of this peace."—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 327.
     14. What will the Master who spoke peace to the troubled waters of
Galilee (Mark 4:37-39) do for troubled hearts today? Phil. 4:7.
     15. Besides giving peace, what will God do for those who accept His
purpose for them? Heb. 13:20, 21.
    NotE.—"The same unseen Hand that guides the planets in their courses,
and upholds the worlds by His power, has made provision for man formed in
His image, that he may be little less than the angels of God while in the per-
formance of his duties on earth. God's purposes have not been answered by
men who have been entrusted with the most solemn truth ever given to man.
He designs that we should rise higher and higher toward a state of perfection,
seeing and realizing at every step the power and glory of God."—Testimonies,
vol. 4, pp. 415, 416.
     16. What kind of Christians does reconciliation with God produce?
Col. 1:27, 28; 2:6, 7, 10.


                       Lesson 2, for April 11, 1942
   The Christian's Relationship to the Heavenly
                      Father
    MEMORY VERSE: "As many as received Him, to them gave He power to be-
come the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name." John 1:12.
    STUDY HELP: "Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing," pages 154-176.
    SEED THOUGHT: "But if you call God your Father, you acknowledge your-
selves His children, to be guided by His wisdom, and to be obedient in all things, know-
ing that His love is changeless. You will accept His plan for your life. As children
of God, you will hold His honor, His character, His family, His work, as the objects of
your highest interest. It will be your joy to recognize and honor your relation to your
Father, and to every member of His family. You will rejoice to do any act, however
humble, that will tend to His glory, or to the well-being of your kindred."—"Thoughts
From the Mount of Blessing," page 156.

     4. How is this relationship formed? How does the Saviour speak of it?
John 1:12; 3:3, 7.
    NcrrE.—"Through this simple act of believing God, the Holy Spirit has be-
gotten a new life in your heart. You areas a child born into the family of God,
and He loves you as He loves His Son."—Steps to Christ, page 56.
    "As our intercessor,Christ's office work is to introduce us to God as His
sons and daughters. H intercedes in behalf of those who receive Him. With
His own blood He has paid their ransom. By virtue of His merits, He gives
them power to become members of the royal family, children of the heavenly
King."—Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 177.
    5. What separation must take place in the establishment of this rela-
tionship? 2 Cor. 6:17, 18; 7:1.
    NOTE.—"Every sinful gratification tends to benumb the faculties and deaden
the mental and spiritual perceptions, and the word or the Spirit of God can
make but a feeble impression upon the heart. Paul writes to the Corinthians,
`Let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting
holiness in the fear of God.' "—The Great Controversy, page 474.
    "The love of the world has a terrible hold upon the people whom the Lord
has commanded to watch and pray always, lest coming suddenly He find them
sleeping."—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 196.
    6. In another powerful appeal, how does the heavenly Father urge His
children to forsake the world? 1 John 2:15-17.
    NoTE.—"You cannot affiliate with the world without becoming a partaker
of its spirit, without becoming guilty of treason against the Lord who has
bought you."—Mrs. E. G. White, in Review and Herald, Aug. 26, 1890.
    "We need to be converted daily. Our prayers should be more fervent; then
they will be more effectual. Stronger and stronger should be our confidence
that God's Spirit will be with us, making us pure and holy, as upright and
fragrant as the cedar of Lebanon."—Testimonies, vol. 7, p. 252.
                  God's Standard for His Children
    7. To represent their heavenly Father properly in this world, what
standard is set for His children? Matt. 5:48; 1 John 3:2.
    NoTE.—"As Christ is, the channel for the revelation of the Father so we
are to be the channel for the revelation of Christ."—Thoughts From the ,Mount
of Blessing, page 67.

    9. How do the daily lives of Christians prove them to be God's children?
1 John 5:4.
    NoTE.—"The Saviour was deeply anxious for His disciples to understand
for what purpose His divinity was united to humanity. He came to the world
to display the glory of God, that man might be uplifted by its restoring power.
God was manifested in Him that He might be manifested in them. Jesus re-
vealed no qualities, and exercised no powers, that men may not have through
faith in Him. His perfect humanity is that which all His followers may pos-
                                     [ 67
sess, if they will be in subjection to God as He was."—The Desire of Ages,
page 664.
    10.. How do God's people demonstrate their love for their heavenly
Father? Mark 12:30, 31.
    11. What outstanding characteristics of the child of God are mentioned
in Hebrews 12:28? (Reverence and godly fear.) In Psalm 9:10? (Trust
in God.) In Psalm 40:8? (Delight in doing God's will.)
    NcrrE.—"The life on earth is the beginning of the life in heaven; education
on earth is an initiation into the principles of heaven; the lifework here is a
training for the lifework there. What we now are, in character and holy serv-
ice, is the sure foreshadowing of what we shall be."—Education, page 307.
    12. How only can these characteristics be developed? Titus 2:11-13.
    13. How do false professors of Christ dishonor the heavenly Father?
Titus 1:16.
                     Inheritance of God's Children
    14. What does God's purpose for His children include? 1 Peter 1:3-5;
Rev. 21:7.
    NorE.—"All the treasures of the universe will be open to the study of God's
children. With unutterable delight we shall enter into the joy and the wisdom
of unfallen beings. We shall share the treasures gained through ages upon
ages spent in contemplation of God's handiwork. And the years of eternity,
as they roll, will continue to bring more glorious revelations. 'Exceeding abun-
dant above all that we ask or think' will be, forever and forever, the imparta-
tion of the gifts of God."—Education, page 307.
    15. Upon what promises may we rest our confidence in the reality of
this inheritance? Heb. 10:35, 36; 2 Peter 3:13.
    NorE.—"We must be there. We must bask in the forgiving smiles of God,
to whom we have become reconciled, and sin no more; we must have access
to that exhaustless fount of vitality, the fruit of the tree of life, and never die;
we must repose under the shadow of its leaves, which are for the service of
the nations, and never again grow weary; we must drink from the life-giving
fountain, and thirst nevermore; we must bathe in its silvery spray, and be
 refreshed; we must walk on its golden sands, and feel that we are no longer
exiles; we must exchange the cross for the crown and feel that the days of our
humiliation are ended; we must lay down the staff   : and take the palm branch,
and feel that the journey is done; we must put off the rent garments of our
 warfare for the white robes of triumph, and feel that the conflict is ended and
 the victory gained; we must exchange the toil-worn dusty girdle of our pil-
 grimage for the glorious vesture of immortality, and feel that sin and the curse
 can never more pollute us. 0 day of rest and triumph, and every good, delay
 not thy dawning I Let the angels at once be sent to gather the elect. Let the
 promise be fulfilled which bears in its train these matchless glories."—Daniel
 and the Revelation, page 776.

        THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
                     June 27, 1942
        Missions of Southern European Division
                                        [71
                       Lesson 3, for April 18, 1942
        The Relation of the Christian to Jesus,
                   the Son of God
    MEMORY VERSE: "This is life eternal, that they might know Thee the only
true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou bast sent." John 17:3.
    STUDY HELP: "Steps to Christ," chapter, "The Test of Discipleship."
    SEED THOUGHT: "In giving us His word, God has put us in possession of
every truth essential for our salvation. Thousands have drawn water from these wells
of life, yet there is no diminishing of the supply. Thousands have set the Lord before
them, and by beholding have been changed into the same image. Their spirit burns
within them as they speak of His character, telling what Christ is to them, and what
they are to Christ. But these searchers have not exhausted these grand and holy
themes. Thousands more may engage in the work of searching out the mysteries of
salvation. As the life of Christ and the character of His mission are dwelt upon, rays
of light will shine forth more distinctly at every attempt to discover truth. Each fresh
search will reveal something more deeply interesting than has yet been unfolded. The
subject is inexhaustible. The study of the incarnation of Christ, His atoning sacrifice
and mediatorial work, will employ the mind of the diligent student as long as time shall
last; and looking to heaven with its unnumbered years, he will exclaim, 'Great is the
mystery of godliness.' "—"Christ's Object Lessons," pages 133, 134.

                           Creator and Redeemer
    1. Who was associated with our heavenly Father in creation? For
whom were all things made? John 1:1-3; Col. 1:15, 16.
    2. How are they associated in the plan of salvation? 2 Cor. 5:18, 19;
Zech. 6:12, 13.
    NoTE.—"It was a costly sacrifice that the Lord of heaven made. Divine
benevolence was stirred to its unfathomable depths; it was impossible for God
to give more."—Testimonies, vol. 9, pp. 59, 60.
    "Christ would reach to the depths of misery to rescue the ruined race. Be-
fore the Father He pleaded in the sinner's behalf, while the host of heaven
awaited the result with an intensity of interest that words cannot express. Long
continued was that mysterious communing,—`the counsel of peace' for the
fallen sons of men. The plan of salvation had been laid before the creation of
the earth; for Christ is the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world;' yet
it was a struggle, even with the King of the universe, to yield up His Son to die
for the guilty race. But 'God so loved the world, that He gave His only-be-
gotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have ever-
lasting life' Oh, the mystery of redemption! the love of God for a world that
did not love Him! Who can know the depths of that love which `passeth
knowledge'? Through endless ages, immortal minds, seeking to comprehend
the mystery of that incomprehensible love, will wonder and adore."—Patri-
archs and Prophets, pages 63, 64.
                     What Jesus Is to the Christian
   3. What steps in humility did Jesus take in order to redeem man?
Phil. 2:6-8; Heb. 2:14, 15.
   NOTE.—"The Son of God could not have shown greater condescension than
He did; He could not have stooped lower."—Testimonies, vol. 7, p. 29.
                                         [8 l
   "As the Son of man, He gave us an example of obedience; as the Son of God,
He gives us power to obey."—The Desire of Ages, page 24.
   4. What relation does Jesus sustain to the Christian? Heb. 2:11, 12.
    5. After His ascension, what did Christ become to the Christian? Heb.
8:1, 2; 2:17.
    NOTE.—"As a priest, Christ is now set down with the Father in His throne.
Upon the throne with the eternal, self-existent One, is He who `hath borne our
griefs, and carried our sorrows,' who 'was in all points tempted like as we are,
yet without sin,' that He might be 'able to succor them that are tempted.' If
any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father.' His intercession is that
of a pierced and broken body, of a spotless life. The wounded hands, the
pierced side, the marred feet, plead for fallen man, whose redemption was pur-
chased at such infinite cost."—The Great Controversy, page 416.
    6. In this capacity, what is He able to do for the Christian? Why?
Heb. 2:18; 7:25.
    Norc.—"The Elder Brother of our race is by the eternal throne. He looks
upon every soul who is turning his face toward Him as the Saviour. He knows
by experience what are the weaknesses of humanity, what are our wants, and
where lies the strength of our temptations; for He was 'in all points tempted
like as we are, yet without sin.' He is watching over you, trembling child of
God. Are you tempted? He will deliver. Are you weak? He will strengthen.
Are you ignorant? He will enlighten. Are you wounded? He will heal. The
Lord `telleth the number of the stars;' and yet 'He healeth the broken in heart,
and bindeth up their wounds.' "—The Ministry of Healing, page 71.
    7. Why are we safe in His keeping? John 10:28, 29.
                        Privileges of the Believer
    8. Under what conditions may we enjoy these wonderful blessings?
Rom. 12: 1 ; 6 : 13, 14.
    9. What change takes place after a complete surrender? Rom. 6:17,
18; Phil. 2:13.
    NOTE.—" 'The prince of this world cometh,' said Jesus, 'and hath nothing
in Me.' There was in Him nothing that responded to Satan's sophistry. He
did not consent to sin. Not even by a thought did He yield to temptation. So
it may be with us. Christ's humanity was united with divinity; He was fitted
for the conflict by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. And He came to make
us partakers of the divine nature. So long as we are united to Him by faith,
sin has no more dominion over us. God reaches for the hand of faith in us to
direct it to lay fast hold upon the divinity of Christ, that we may attain to
perfection of character."—The Desire of Ages, page 123.
     10. How may we enjoy sweet fellowship with Jesus? John 14:23;
 Rev. 3: 20.
     NoTE.—"Those who take Christ at His word, and surrender their souls to
 His keeping, their lives to His ordering, will find peace and quietude. Nothing of
 the world can make them sad when Jesus makes them glad by His presence. In
 perfect acquiescence there is perfect rest. The Lord says, 'Thou wilt keep him
 in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on Thee: because he trusteth in Thee.'
 Our lives may seem a tangle; but as we commit ourselves to the wise Master
                                         [9 I
Worker, He will bring out the pattern of life and character that will be to His
own glory. And that character which expresses the glory—character—of
Christ will be received into the Paradise of God. A renovated race shall walk
with Him in white, for they are worthy."—The Desire of Ages, page 331.
     11. How do we reveal our love for Jesus and our trust in Him? John
14:21; 1 John 4:16-18.
    NorE.—"All true obedience comes from the heart. It was heart work with
Christ. And if we consent, He will so identify Himself with our thoughts and
aims, so blend our hearts and minds into conformity to His will, that when
obeying Him we shall be but carrying out our own impulses. The will, refined
and sanctified, will find its highest delight in doing His service. When we know
God as it is our privilege to know Him, our life will be a life of continual
obedience. Through an appreciation of the character of Christ, through com-
munion with God, sin will become hateful to us."—The Desire of Ages, page
668.
    12. If such an intimate relationship is sustained, of what may we be
assured? John 15:7; 1 John 3:21, 22.
     13. What will be the result of such intimate association with Jesus?
John 15:5, 8, 16, 11.
    Nors.—"If men will but humble themselves before God, if they will not
exalt their judgment as the all-controlling influence, if they will make room
for the Lord to plan and work, God will use the qualifications He has given
them in a way that will glorify His name. He will purify His workers from
all selfishness, cutting off the branches that would entwine around undesirable
objects, pruning the vine so that it will produce fruit. God is the great Hus-
bandman. He will make everything in the lives of those who are laborers
together with Christ subservient to His great purpose of growth and fruit
bearing. It is His plan, by conforming His servants day by day to the image of
Christ, by making them partakers of the divine nature, to cause them to bear
fruit abundantly."—Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 186.
                        Results to the Christian
    14. How only can the heart be calm and peaceful amid the trials, hard-
ships, and dangers of these last days? Matt. 11:2830; Isa. 26:3.
    Non.—"Let us be hopeful and courageous. Despondency in God's service
is sinful and unreasonable. He knows our every necessity. To the omnipotence
of the King of kings our covenant-keeping God unites the gentleness and care
of the tender shepherd. His power is absolute, and it is the pledge of the sure
fulfillment of His promises to all who trust in Him. He has means for the re-
moval of every difficulty, that those who serve Him and respect the means He
employs may be sustained. His love is as far above all other love as the heavens
are above the earth. He watches over His children with a love that is measure-
less and everlasting."—The Ministry of Healing, pages 481, 482.
    15. What will it mean to know Jesus? How only can we become ac-
quainted with Him? John 17:3; 5:39.
    Nors.—"Transformation of character, purity of life, efficiency in service,
adherence to correct principles, all depend upon a right knowledge of God.
This knowledge is the essential preparation both for this life and for the life
to come."—The Ministry of Healing, page 409.

                      Lesson 4, for April 25, 1942

    The Christian's Relation to the Holy Spirit
   MEMORY VERSE: "Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed
unto the day of redemption." Eph. 4:30.
   STUDY HELPS: "The Desire of Ages," pages 172-177, 669-672; "The Acts of
the Apostles," pages 47-56, 529-533.
    SEED THOUGHT: "Never will the human heart know happiness until it is sub-
mitted to be molded by the Spirit of God. The Spirit conforms the renewed soul to the
model, Jesus Christ. Through the influence of the Spirit, enmity against God is
changed into faith and love, and pride into humility. The soul perceives the beauty of
truth, and Christ is honored in excellence and perfection of character. As these
changes are effected, angels break out in rapturous song, and God and Christ rejoice
over souls fashioned after the divine similitude."—"Messages to Young People," pages
55, 56.
                        Office of the Holy Spirit
   1. What part did the Spirit of God have in the creation of the world?
Gen. 1:2.
   2. How did the Holy Spirit operate in giving us the Scriptures? 2
Peter 1:21.
   NorE.—"The Holy Spirit enabled the disciples to exalt the Lord alone, and
guided the pens of the sacred historians, that the record of the words and works
of Christ might be given to the world."—Gospel Workers, page 286.
    3. During Christ's earthly sojourn, how did the Spirit co-operate with
Him in service? Luke 4:18; Acts 10:38.
    4. After Christ's ascension, who became His successor on earth? John
14:26; 16:7, 14.
    Nora.—"The Holy Spirit is Christ's representative, but divested of the
personality of humanity, and independent thereof. Cumbered with humanity,
Christ could not be in every place personally. Therefore it was for their interest
that He should go to the Father, and send the Spirit to be His successor on
earth. No one could then have any advantage because of his location or his
personal contact with Christ. By the Spirit the Saviour would be accessible
to all. In this sense He would be nearer to them than if He had not ascended
on high."—The Desire of Ages, page 669.
    5. In what ways does the Holy Spirit help the individual? John 16:8,
13; 3:5.
            What the Holy Spirit Does for the Christian
     6. What assurance have we of the Holy Spirit's help and of His interest
 in our salvation? Luke 11:13; Rom. 8:26, 27.
     NOTE.—"The Spirit was to be given as a regenerating agent, and without
 this the sacrifice of Christ would have been of no avail. The power of evil had
 been strengthening for centuries, and the submission of men to this satanic
 captivity was amazing. Sin could be resisted and overcome only through the
 mighty agency of the third person of the Godhead, who would come with no
 modified energy, but in the fullness of divine power. It is the Spirit that makes
 effectual what has been wrought out by the world's Redeemer. It is by the
                                       [111
Spirit that the heart is made pure. Through the Spirit the believer becomes a
partaker of the divine nature. Christ has given His Spirit as a divine power
to overcome all hereditary and cultivated tendencies to evil, and to impress
His own character upon His church."—The Desire of Ages, page 671.
     7. After convicting of sin, what transformation will He make in the
surrendered life? Titus 3:5, last part; 2 Cor. 3:18.
    Nors.—"God takes men as they are, and educates them for His service, if
they will yield themselves to Him. The Spirit of God, received into the soul,
quickens all its faculties. Under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, the mind that
is devoted unreservedly to God, develops harmoniously, and is strengthened to
comprehend and fulfill the requirements of God. The weak, vacillating char-
acter becomes changed to one of strength and steadfastness. Continual devo-
tion establishes so close a relation between Jesus and His disciples that the
Christian becomes like his Master in character. He has clearer, broader views.
His discernment is more penetrative, his judgment better balanced. So quick-
ened is he by the life-giving power of the Sun of Righteousness, that he is en-
abled to bear much fruit to the glory of God."—Gospel Workers, pages 285, 286.
    8. What work of grace is wrought in our hearts by the Spirit? How
will this enable us to live a righteous life? Rom. 5:5; Matt. 22:37-40.
    NOTE.—"God's law is fulfilled only as men love Him with heart, mind, soul,
and strength, and their neighbor as themselves. It is the manifestation of this
love that brings glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace and good will
to men. The Lord is glorified when the great end of His law is attained. It is
the work of the Holy Spirit from age to age to impart love to human hearts;
for love is the living principle of brotherhood."—Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 139.
    9. How does the Spirit enable Christians to understand the Bible?
John 16:13; 1 Cor. 2:9, 10, 13.
    NOTE.—"The Holy Spirit, sent from heaven by the benevolence of infinite
love, takes the things of God, and reveals them to every soul that has an im-
plicit faith in Christ. . . . As we study the Scriptures, we should pray for the
light of God's Holy Spirit to shine upon the word, that we may see and appre-
ciate its treasures."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 113.
    "Christ promised that the Holy Spirit should abide with those who wrestle
for victory over sin, to demonstrate the power of divine might by endowing
the human agent with supernatural strength and instructing the ignorant in
the mysteries of the kingdom of God."—Gospel Workers, page 286.
    10. What is the Christian's secret of success in service? Acts 1:8;
Luke 12:12.
    Nors.—"Only to those who wait humbly upon God, who watch for His
guidance and grace, is the Spirit given. This promised blessing, claimed by
faith, brings all other blessings in its train. It is given according to the riches
of the grace of Christ, and He is ready to supply every soul according to the
capacity to receive."—Gospel Workers, page 285.
            Evidences of Submission to the Holy 'Spirit
    11. How will the spiritually minded person think and act? Rom. 8:6,
8, 9; Gal. 5:16, 22, 23, 25.
    12. What results•were seen in the early church when the Holy Spirit
controlled the hearts of the believers? Acts 4:31-33; 11:22-24.
                                   [ 12 ]
   Nom.—"The presence of the Spirit with God's workers will give the pres-
entation of the truth a power that not all the honor or glory of the world
could give. The Spirit furnishes the strength that sustains striving, wrestling
souls in every emergency, amidst the unfriendliness of relatives, the hatred of
the world, and the realization of their own imperfections and mistakes "—
Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 22.
                      The Grieving of the Spirit
    13. 'What are some of the things the Christian must do in order not to
grieve the Holy Spirit?
   a. Must open the heart's door. Rev. 3:20.
    b. Must receive the Spirit. John 20:22.
    c. Must turn away from sin. Eph. 4:31.
    d. Must be kind to others. Eph. 4:32.
    e. Must be His witnesses. Acts 1:8.
    14. Why is it so all-important for the Christian not to grieve the Holy
Spirit? Eph. 4:30. (Rev. 7:3; 14:1, 5.)
    NOTE.—"Now is the time to prepare. The seal of God will never be placed
upon the forehead of an impure man or woman. It will never be placed upon
the forehead of the ambitious, world-loving man or woman. It will never be
placed upon the forehead of men or women of false tongues or deceitful hearts.
All who receive the seal must be without spot before God—candidates for
heaven. Go forward, my brethren and sisters. I can only write briefly upon
these points at this time, merely calling your attention to the necessity of
preparation. Search the Scriptures for yourselves, that you may understand
the fearful solemnity of the present hour."—Testimonies vol. 5, p. 216.
    15. What are two things we must avoid in order not to sin against the
Holy Spirit? 1 Thess. 5:19; Acts 7:51.
    NOTE.—"Precious light is to shine forth from the word of God, and let no
one presume to dictate what shall or what shall not be brought before the peo-
ple in the messages of enlightenment that He shall send, and so quench the
Spirit of God. . . . It was from pursuing this very course that the popular
churches were left in partial darkness, and that is why the messages of heaven
have not reached them."—Testimonies on Sabbath School Work, page 65. ,
    "There is not an impulse of our nature, not a faculty of the mind or an
inclination of the heart, but needs to be, moment by moment, under the control
of the Spirit of God."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 421.


                   Thirteenth Sabbath "Overflow"
    The "overflow" of the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering this quarter is to es-
tablish the gospel work in the North African Union, where live nearly 14,000,-
000 people. About 3,000,000 of these are Europeans, the others are Arabs.
A serious handicap to the work is that we do not possess one chapel in all this
field. Our largest church membership is in the city of Algiers, and a repre-
sentative place of worship is greatly needed. Our people ask for your loyal
support on the Thirteenth Sabbath to help meet this need.

                       Lesson 5, for May 2, 1942

          The Christian's Relation to the Bible
    MEMORY VERSE: "Search the scriptures; for . . . they are they which tes-
tify of Me." John 5:39.
    STUDY HELP: "Steps to Christ," chapter, "A Knowledge of God."
    SEED THOUGHT: "None but those who have fortified the mind with the truths
of the Bible will stand through the last great conflict. To every soul will come the
searching test, Shall I obey God rather than men? The decisive hour is even now at
hand. Are our feet planted on the rock of God's immutable word? Are we prepared to
stand firm in defense of the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus?"—"The
Great Controversy," pages 593, 594.

                            The Supreme Book
    1. How were the Scriptures given to man? 2 Tim. 3 :16.
    NorE.—"The union of the divine and the human, manifest in Christ, exists
also in the Bible. The truths revealed are all 'given by inspiration of God;' yet
they are expressed in the words of men, and are adapted to human needs. Thus
it may be said of the Book of God, as it was of Christ, that 'the Word was made
flesh, and dwelt among us.' And this fact, so far from being an argument
against the Bible, should strengthen faith in it as the word of God. Those who
pronounce upon the inspiration of the Scriptures, accepting some portions as
divine, while they reject other parts as human, overlook the fact that Christ,
the divine, partook of our human nature, that He might reach humanity. In
the work of God for man's redemption, divinity and humanity are combined."
—Testimonies, vol. 5, pp. 747, 748.
    2. What part did man have in its preparation? 2 Peter 1:21.
     3. What assurance have we of the perpetuity of the word of God? Isa.
40:8; Matt. 24:35.
    NorE.—"The empire of Caesar is gone; the legions of Rome are moldering
in the dust; the avalanches that Napoleon hurled upon Europe have melted
away; the pride of the Pharaohs is fallen; the pyramids that they raised to be
their tombs are sinking every day in the desert sands; Tyre is a rock for bleach-
ing fishermen's nets; Sidon has scarcely left a wreck behind; but the word of
God still survives. All things that threatened to extinguish it have only aided
it; and it proves every day how transient is the noblest monument that man
can build, how enduring is the least word that God has spoken. Tradition has
dug for it a grave; intolerance has lighted for it many a fagot; many a Judas
has betrayed it with a kiss; many a Peter has denied it with an oath; many a
Demas has forsaken it: but the word of God still endures."—Dr. Cummings.
     4. How has its purity been preserved through the ages? Ps. 12:6, 7.
    Nora.—"Satan had urged on the papal priests and prelates to bury the
word of truth beneath the rubbish of error, heresy, and superstition; but in a
most wonderful manner it was preserved uncorrupted through all the ages of
darkness. It bore not the stamp of man, but the impress of God. Men have
been unwearied in their efforts to obscure the plain, simple meaning of the
Scriptures, and to make them contradict their own testimony; but like the ark
upon the billowy deep, the word of God outrides the storms that threaten it
with destruction."—The Great Controversy, page 69.
                                       [14 ]
    The Vaudois sometimes are called "the Israel of the Alps." "For a thou-
sand years," these "witnesses for the truth maintained the ancient faith." Like
a huge pipeline that carries the pure mountain water to a distant city, protect-
ing it from all contamination along the way, those fearless heroes of the cross
carried God's blessed word in its purity down from the early Christian era to
the Reformation of the sixteenth century, shielding it from all heathen adultera-
tions with their own lifeblood. A portion of the pledge taken by the Vaudois
reads as follows:
    "'We promise to maintain the Bible, whole and without admixture, accord-
ing to the usage of the true apostolic church, persevering in this holy religion,
though it be at, the peril of our life, in order that we may transmit it to our
children, intact and pure, as we received it from our fathers.' "—J. A. Wylie,
History of Protestantism, vol. 2, p. 462.
    5. What illustrations of the power of this word are given? Heb. 4:12;
Jer. 23:29; Isa. 55:10, 11.
    6. How do the things of nature bear witness to the mighty power of the
word of God? Heb. 1:3.
                        The Bible and Salvation
    7. What should be our attitude toward the Bible? Why are we com-
manded to study it? 1 Thess. 2:13; 2 Tim. 3:14, 15.
    Nom.—"The word of the living God is not merely written, but spoken. The
Bible is God's voice speaking to us, just as surely as though we could hear it
with our ears. If we realized this, with what awe would we open God's word,
and with what earnestness would we search its precepts I The reading and con-
templation of the Scriptures would be regarded as an audience with the Infinite
One."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 393.
    "Hold fast to the Bible as the sheet anchor of your liberties; write its pre-
cepts on your hearts and practice them in your lives. To the influence of this
Book we are indebted for the progress made in civilization, and to this we must
look as our guide in the future."—U. S. Grant.
     8. What is one reason Christ's followers fail to reach, the highest stand-
ard of Christian living? Matt. 22:29; Acts 17:11.
    NoTE.----"If we would live a true Christian life, the conscience must be
quickened by constant contact with the word of God. All the precious things
which at infinite cost God has provided for us, will do us good; they cannot
strengthen us and produce spiritual growth unless we appropriate them. We
must eat the word of God make it a part of ourselves."—Testimonies, vol.
7, p. 195.
    9. How is Bible study related to the new birth and to Christian growth?
1 Peter 1:23; 2:2.
    NoTE.—"Those who will put on the whole armor of God, and devote some
time every day to meditation and prayer, and to the study of the Scriptures,
will be connected with Heaven, and will have a saving, transforming influence
upon those around them. Great thoughts, noble aspirations, clear perceptions
of truth and duty to God, will be theirs. They will be yearning for purity, for
light, for love, for all the graces of heavenly birth. Their earnest prayers will
enter into that within the veil. This class will have a sanctified boldness to
come into the presence of the Infinite One. They will feel that Heaven's light
                                      [ 15 ]
and glories are for them, and they will become refined, elevated, ennobled by
this intimate acquaintance with God. Such is the privilege of true Christians."
—Testimonies, vol. 5, pp. 112, 113.
                            Methods of Study
    10. What must be our attitude toward truth if we would understand
the Bible? John 8:31, 32; 7:17.
    NorE.—"Whoever will prayerfully study the Bible, desiring to know the
truth, that he may obey it, will receive divine enlightenment. He will under-
stand the Scriptures."—The Desire of Ages, page 459.
    11. Who alone is the infallible interpreter of divine truth? John 16:13,
14; 1 Cor. 2:10, 13.
    NorE.—"We should carefully study the Bible, asking God for the aid of
the Holy Spirit, that we may understand His word."—The Desire of Ages,
page 390.
                        For Every Present Need
    12. What is the nature of the Christian's warfare and of the weapons
needed in it? To what is the word of God likened? Eph. 6:12-17.
    13. Give two illustrations of Christ's use of the Scriptures. Matt. 4:4,
7, 10; Luke 24:27.
    NOTE.—"Jesus met Satan with the words of Scripture. 'It is written,' He
said. In every temptation the weapon of His warfare was the word of God."
—The Desire of Ages, page 120.
    14. How did Job regard the word of God? Job 23:12.
    15. How is Bible study woven into successful service? 2 Tim. 2:15;
1 Peter 3:15.
    16. At what period in the world's history will it be true that only those
who have hidden God's word in their hearts will have access to its promises?
Amos 8:11, 12; Ps. 119:11.
    NOTE.—"Those who had not prized God's word were hurrying to and fro,
wandering from sea to sea, and from the north to the east, to seek the word of
the Lord. Said the angel, 'They shall not find it. There is a famine in the land;
not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but for hearing the words of the
Lord. What would they not give for one word of approval from God ! but no,
they must hunger and thirst on. Day after day have they slighted salvation,
prizing earthly riches and earthly pleasure higher than any heavenly treasure
or inducement. They have rejected Jesus and despised His saints. The filthy
must remain filthy forever.' "—Early Writings, pages 281, 282.



       THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING

                         Lesson 6, for May 9, 1942

             The Christian's Relation to Prayer
     MEMORY VERSE: "Ye shall seek Me, and find Me, when ye shall search for Me
 with all your heart." Jer. 29:13.
     STUDY HELPS: "Steps to Christ," chapter, "The Privilege of Prayer;" "Edu-
 cation," pages 260, 261.
     SEED THOUGHT: "The reason why so many are left to themselves in places of
 temptation is that they do not set the Lord always before them. When we permit our
 communion with God to be broken, our defense is departed from us. Not all your good
 purposes and good intentions will enable you to withstand evil. You must be men and
 women of prayer. Your petitions must not be faint, occasional, and fitful, but earnest,
 persevering, and constant. It is not always necessary to bow upon your knees in order
 to pray. Cultivate the habit of talking with the Saviour when you are alone, when you
,are walking, and when you are busy with your daily labor. Let the heart be continu-
 ally uplifted in silent petition for help, for light, for strength, for knowledge. Let
 every breath be a prayer."—"The Ministry of Healing," pages 510, 511.

                        Holding Converse With God
    1. How comprehensive is God's invitation to sinners? By what title are
 we to address Him? Jer. 29:11-13; Luke 11:2.
     2. What is He able to do for us? Eph. 3:20, 21.
    NoTE.—"Keep your wants, your joys, your sorrows, your cares, and your
 fears, before God. You cannot burden Him; you cannot weary Him. He who
 numbers the hairs of your head is not indifferent to the wants of His children.
 `The. Lord is very pitififf, and of tender mercy.' His heart of love is touched
 by our sorrows, and even by our utterance of them. Take to Him everything
 that perplexes the mind. . . . The relations between God and each soul are as
 distinct and full as though there were not another soul for whom He gave His
 beloved Son."—Steps to Christ, pages 104, 105.
    3. How has God revealed to us His desire to have us come to Him fO-r
 help? Rom. 8:32; Isa. 55:1.

                     Requests We May Bring to Him
   "4.:- Name some of the personal blessings we are invited to request of God:
    a. Forgiveness. 1 John 1:9; Matt. 6:12.
    b. Daily necessities. Matt. 6:11.
    c. Wisdom to do right. James 1:5.
    d. Keeping power. Matt. 6:13.
    e. Deliverance in time of trouble. Ps. 50:15; 34:6.
    f. Great faith. Matt. 15:28; Luke 17:5.
    g. For health when sick. James 5:14-16.
     NOTE.—"Although there may be a tainted, corrupted atmosphere around
 us, we need not breathe its miasma, but may live in the pure air of heaven. We
 may close every door to impure imaginings and unholy thoughts by lifting the
 soul into the presence of God through sincere prayer. Those whose hearts are
                                          [ 17 7
open to receive the support and blessing of God will walk in a holier atmos-
phere than that of earth, and will have constant communion with Heaven."—
Steps to Christ, page 104.
   5. For whom are we admonished to pray? Eph. 6:18; Matt. 5:44; 2
Thess. 3:1; 1 Tim. 2:1.
   6. What special request should we make for rulers? Why? 1 Tim. 2:2, 3.
   7. What great needs should we spread daily before our heavenly Fa-
ther? Matt. 9:37, 38.

                         Conditions to Be Met
    8. Name some features of acceptable prayer. 1 Cor. 14:15; Phil. 4:6.
    NoTE.—"We must not only pray in Christ's name, but by the inspiration of
the Holy Spirit. This explains what is meant when it is said that the Spirit '
`maketh intercession for us, with groanings which cannot be uttered,' Such
prayer God delights to answer. When with earnestness and intensity we breathe
a prayer in the name of Christ, there is in that very intensity a pledge from God
that He is about to answer our prayer 'exceeding abundantly above all that we
ask or think.' "—Christ's Object Lessons, page 147.
    9. What are two essentials to effectual prayer? James 1:6; Heb. 11:6;
Mark 11:24.
    NoTE.—"Faith is the gift of God, but the power to exercise it is ours. Faith
is the hand by which the soul takes hold upon the divine offers of grace and
mercy."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 431.
    "There are certain conditions upon which we may expect that God will hear
and answer our prayers. One of the first of these is that we feel our need of
help from Him. He has promised, 'I will pour water upon him that is thirsty,
and floods upon the dry ground.' Those who hunger and thirst after righteous-
ness, who long after God, may be sure that they will be filled. The heart must
be open to the Spirit's influence, or God's blessing cannot be received."—Steps
to Christ, page 99.
    10. What besides faith does sincere, effectual prayer require? 2 Chron.
7:14; 1 John 3:22.
    NorE.—"Instead of releasing man from obedience, it is faith, and faith only,
that makes us partakers of the grace of Christ, which enables us to render
obedience. We do not earn salvation by our obedience; for salvation is the
free gift of God, to be received by faith. But obedience is the fruit of faith."
—Steps to Christ, pages 65, 66.
   11. How does our relation to others affect our prayers? Matt. 6:14, 15;
Job 42:10.
   NOTE.—"Nothing can justify an unforgiving spirit. He who is unmerciful
toward others shows that he himself is not a partaker of God's pardoning
grace. In God's forgiveness the heart of the erring one is drawn close to the
great heart of Infinite Love."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 251.
  12. In group prayer, what is an all-important element? Matt. 18 : 19 ;
Acts 4:31, 32, first part.
                                 [18 1
    NOTE.—"Let Christians put away all dissension, and give themselves to
God for the saving of the lost. Let them ask in faith for the promised blessing,
and it will come. The outpouring of the Spirit in the days of the apostles was
the 'former rain,' and glorious was the result.- But the latter rain will be more
abundant."—Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 21.
    13. In what reverential attitude should we approach the Ruler of the
universe when we come to Him in prayer? Ps. 95:6.
    NOTE.—"While engaged in our daily work, we should lift the soul to heaven
in prayer. These silent petitions rise like incense before the throne of grace;
and the enemy is baffled. The Christian whose heart is thus stayed upon God
cannot be overcome."—Gospel Workers, page 254.
    In his regular seasons of prayer, the most appropriate way for the Chris-
tian to approach his heavenly Father is reverently to kneel in the presence of
his Maker. Jesus set us this example (Luke 22:41), as did also Daniel (Dan.
6:10), Peter (Acts 9:40), Paul (Eph. 3:14), and others.
    "Both in public and in private worship, it is our privilege to bow on our
knees before the Lord when we offer our petitions to Him."—Gospel Workers,
page 178.
                    Examples of Victorious Prayer
    14. How does the life of Christ on earth demonstrate the efficacy of
prayer? Mark 1:35; Luke 6:12; Heb. 5:7.
    NOTE.—"Let your heart break for the longing it has for God, for the living
God. The life of Christ has shown what humanity can do by being partaker of
the divine nature. All that Christ received from God we too may have. Then
ask and receive. With the persevering faith of Jacob, with the unyielding per-
sistence of Elijah, claim for yourself all that God has promised."—Christ's
Object Lessons, page 149.
    15. What experiences in the lives of Elijah and Daniel show the great
possibilities in prayer? James 5:17, 18; Dan. 6:10, 22.
    16. In order to be overcomers, what must be our attitude toward prayer
during the troubles of these last days? 1 Peter 4:7; Luke 21:36.
    NOTE.—"Their only hope is in the mercy of God; their only defense will be
prayer. As Joshua was pleading before the Angel, so the remnant church, with
brokenness of heart and earnest faith, will plead for pardon and deliverance
through Jesus their Advocate. . . .
    "But while the followers of Christ have sinned, they have not given them-
selves to the control of evil. They have put away their sins, and have sought
the Lord in humility and contrition, and the divine Advocate pleads in their
behalf."—Testimonies, vol. 5, pp. 473,474.

                        Lesson 7, for May 16, 1942

                   The Christian in His Home
    MEMORY VERSE: "Be kindly affectitmed one to another with brotherly love;
in honor preferring one another." Rom. 12:10.
    STUDY HELP: "The Ministry of Healing," pages 349355, 388-394.
    SEED THOUGHT: "The mission of the home extends beyond its own members.
 The Christian home is to be an object lesson, illustrating the excellence of the true
 principles of life. Such an illustration will be a power for good in the world. Far more
 powerful than any sermon that can be preached is the influence of a true home upon
 human hearts and lives. As the youth go out from such a home, the lessons they have
 learned are imparted. Nobler principles of life are introduced into other households,
 and an uplifting influence works in the community."—"The Ministry of Healing,"
 page 352.
                       Two Institutions From Eden
      1. What two institutions have come down to fallen man from beyond
 the gates of paradise? Matt, 19:4-6; Mark 2:27, 28.
     NOTE.—" 'Marriage is honorable;' it was one of the first gifts of God to
 man, and it is one of the two institutions that, after the fall, Adam brought
 with him beyond the gates of Paradise. . . .
     "In six days the great work of creation had been accomplished. And God
 `rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had made. And God
 blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it; because that in it He had rested from
 all His work which God created and made' . . .
   . "Following the example of the Creator, man was to rest upon this sacred
day, that as he should look upon the heavens and the earth, he might reflect
 upon God's great work of creation; and that as he should behold the evidences
of God's wisdom and goodness, his heart might be filled with love and reverence
for his Maker."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pages 46, 47.
     2. What was the origin of the home? Gen. 2:18; 1:27.
     NOTE.—"Among all the creatures that God had made on the earth, there
was not one equal to man. And 'God said, It is not good that the man should
be alone; I will make him an helpmeet for him.' Man was not made to dwell
in solitude ; he was to be a social being. Without companionship, the beautiful
scenes and delightful employments of Eden would have failed to yield perfect
 happiness. Even communion with angels could not have satisfied his desire
 for sympathy and companionship. There was none of the same nature to love,
and to be loved.
     "God Himself gave Adam a companion. He provided 'an helpmeet for him,'
—a helper corresponding to him,—one who was fitted to be his companion,
and who could be one with him in love and sympathy. Eve was created from
a rib taken from the side of Adam, signifying that she was not to control him
as the head, nor to be trampled under his feet as an inferior, but to stand by
his side as an equal, to be loved and protected by him."—Patriarchs and
Prophets, page 46.
     3. Who celebrated the first marriage and what was it designed to do?
Mark 10:6-9.
     NotE.—"God celebrated the first marriage. Thus the institution has for
its originator the Creator of the universe. . . . When the divine principles are
recognized andobeyed
               _       _ in this relation, marriage is a blessing; it guards the
                                          20 ]
purity and happiness of the race, it provides for man's social needs, it elevates
the physical, the intellectual, and the moral nature."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
page 46.
                Characteristics of the Christian Home
     4. What daily prayer service in the sanctuary was designed to serve
as an example for the Christian home today? Ex. 30:1, 7, 8.
     Nom.—"Fathers and mothers, however prpcsing your business, do not fail
to gather your family around God's altar. Ask for the guardianship of holy
angels in your home. Remember that your dear ones are exposed to tempta-
tions. Daily annoyances beset the path of young and old. Those who would
live patient, loving, cheerful lives must pray. Only by receiving constant help
from God can we gain the victory over self."—The Ministry of Healing, page
393.
     5. What is to reign in the Christian home? Eph. 5:25; Titus 2:4.
     NorE.—"Parents, let the sunshine of love, cheerfulness, and happy content-
ment enter your own hearts, and let its sweet, cheering influence pervade your
 home. Manifest a kindly, forbearing spirit; and encourage the same in your
 children, cultivating all the graces that will brighten the home life. The at-
mosphere thus created will be to the children what air and sunshine are to the
 vegetable world, promoting health and vigor of mind and body."—The Minis-
 try of Healing, page 387.
     6. Where there is not perfect unity in the home, how are the prayers
 affected? 1 Peter 3:7, last part.
                            The Home Builders
    7. How close should be the tie binding husband and wife together?
What relationship is this union designed to represent? Eph. 5:25-33.
    Nom--"The spirit that Christ manifests toward us is the spirit that hus-
band and wife are to manifest toward each other. , . . Neither the husband
nor the wife should attempt to exercise over the other an arbitrary control.
Do not try to compel each other to yield to your wishes. You cannot do this
and retain each other's love. Be kind, patient, and forbearing, considerate, and
courteous. By the grace of God you can succeed in making each other happy,
as in your marriage vow you promised to do."—The Ministry of Healing, page
361.
    8. How only can marriage prove the mutual blessing that God desires
it to be to the home builders? Eph. 4:1-3.
    No.:T.—The following ten excellent suggestions for home builders will be
found on pages 360-362 of The Ministry of Healing:
    1. "Determine to be all that it is possible to be to each other."
    2. "Continue the early attentions."
    3. "In every way encourage each other in fighting the battles of life."
    4. "Study to advance the happiness of each other."
    5. "Let there be mutual love, mutual forbearance."
    6. "Let each give love rather than exact it."
     7. "Cultivate that which is noblest in yourselves."
    8. "Be quick to recognize the good qualities in each other."
    9. "Remember that true joy can be found only in unselfish service."
    10. "Make Christ first and last and best in everything."
                                      [ 21 1
    9. What promise of God's help in saving their children may devoted
parents claim? Isa. 49:24, 25.
    NOTE.—"Brought up under the wise and loving guidance of a true home,
children will have no desire to wander away in search of pleasure and com-
panionship. Evil will not attract them. The spirit that prevails in the home
will mold their characters; they, will form habits and principles that will be a
strong defense against temptation when they shall leave the home shelter and
take their place in the world."—The Ministry of Healing, page 394.
               The Christian Family and Its Influence
    10. What should be the attitude of children toward their parents? Eph.
6:1-3; Ex. 20:12.
    NoTE.—"Our youth profess to be among those who keep the command-
ments of God, and yet many of them neglect and break the fifth command-
ment; and the rich blessing promised to those who observe this precept, and
honor father and mother, cannot be fulfilled to them. Unless they repent of
their sin, and reform their practices and character through the grace of Christ,
they will never enter into the new earth, upon which they may live eternally.
Those who do not respect and love their parents will not respect and honor
God. Those who fail to bear the test, who fail to honor their God-fearing
parents, fail to obey God, and therefore cannot expect to come into the land of
 promise."—Messages to Young People, pages 331, 332.
    11. How did the great Exemplar of youth bless the humble home in
which He grew up? Luke 2:51, 52.
    NOTE.—"The importance and the opportunities of the home life are illus-
trated in the life of Jesus. He who came from heaven to be our example and
teacher spent thirty years as a member of the household at Nazareth. . . .
    "In an unobtrusive way, from His very childhood, He ministered to others,
and because of this, when He began His public ministry, many heard Him
gladly."—The Ministry of Healing, pages 349, 350.
    12. What kind of home did Abraham have? How did it affect others?
Gen. 18:19, 18.
    NoTE.—"Abraham's affection for his children and his household led him to
guard their religious faith, to impart to them a knowledge of the divine statutes,
as the most precious legacy he could, transmit to them, and through them to
the world."—Patriarchs and prophets, page 142.
    13. What influence should the Christian home exert outside its own
boundary? Gen. 26:4, 5; Isa. 61:6, 9. (Ps. 128:1-4)
    NOTE.—"A well-ordered Christian household is a powerful argument in
favor of the reality of the Christian religion,—an argument that the infidel
cannot gainsay. . . . If the homes of professed Christians had a right religious
mold, they would exert a mighty influence for good. They would indeed be
the 'light of the world.'"—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 144.

                        Lesson 8, for May 23, 1942
                  The Christian in the Church
    MEMORY VERSE: "I the Lord do keep it; I will water it every moment: lest
any hurt it, I will keep it night and day." Isa. 27:3.
    STUDY HELP: "The Acts of the Apostles," pages 9-16, 593-602.
    SEED THOUGHT: "The church is God's appointed agency for the salvation of
men. It was organized for service, and its mission is to carry the gospel to the world.
From the beginning it has been God's plan that through His church shall be reflected
to the world His fullness and His sufficiency. The members of the church, those whom
He has called out of darkness into His marvelous light, are to show forth His glory.
The church is the repository of the riches of the grace of Christ; and through the
church will eventually be made manifest, even to 'the principalities and powers in
heavenly places,' the final and full display of the love of God."—"The Acts of the
Apostles," page 9.
                         God's Family on Earth
    1. Where are the members of God's great family? For whom are they
named? Where is the family record kept? Eph. 3:14, 15; Heb. 12:23.
    2. What does God call the members of His family? 2 Cor. 6:17, 18.
    3. Mention another figure used to represent the church and Christ's
intimate relation to it. Eph. 1:22, 23; Col. 1:18.
                    Privileges and Responsibilities
    4. How does God regard His church, and how tenderly does He care
for it? Isa. 5:7; 27:3.
    NoTE.—"Enfeebled and defective as it may appear, the church is the one
object upon which God bestows in a special sense His supreme regard. It is
the theater of His grace, in which He delights to reveal His power to trans-
form hearts."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 12.
    5. What is the high privilege and great mission of God's family, or
church, on earth? Matt. 28:18-20.
    6. What is the chief business of each member of God's church? 1 Peter
2:9, 10; Isa. 62:1, 2.
    7. What provision has God made to enable His church to do its ap-
pointed work? Acts 1:8; Eph. 4:11-13.
    NoTE.—"When we are endowed with the Spirit, we take hold by faith of
infinite power. There is nothing lost of that which comes from God. The
Saviour of the world sends His messages to the soul, that the darkness of error
may be dispelled. The work of the Spirit is immeasurably great. It is from
this source that power and efficiency come to the worker for God."—Gospel
Workers, page 289.
                   Characteristics of God's Family
     8. After joining God's family through the new birth (John 3:3, 7),
 whose nature will the children manifest? 2 Peter 1:4.
     9. What strong evidence of true discipleship did Jesus pray that His
 followers might possess? John 17:11; 13:35.
     NoTE.—"When Christ's prayer is fully believed, when its instruction is
 brought into the daily life of God's people, unity of action will be seen in our
                                       123 )
ranks. Brother will be bound to brother by the golden bonds of the love of
Christ. The Spirit of God alone can bring about this oneness. He who sanc-
tified Himself can sanctify His disciples. United with Him, they will be united
with one another in the most holy faith. When we strive for this unity as God
desires us to strive for it, it will come to us."—Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 243.
     10. How should themembers of the church relate themselves to one an-
other? 1 Cor. 12;25-27; Col. 3:12-15.
     11. In,order that-we as members of God's family on earth may be pre-
pared, for the supreme crisis in the great controversy, what must we do?
2 COL 7:1.
    NoTE.—"The requirements of God must be brought home to the conscience.
Men and women must be" awakened to the duty of self-mastery, the need of
purity, freedom from every depraving appetite and defiling habit. They need
to be impressed with the fact that all their powers of mind and body are the
gift of God, and are to be preserved in the best possible condition for His serv-
ice."—The Ministry of Healing, page 130.
                      The Assembly of the Saints
    12. What is the place of worship called? How are we commanded to
regard it and why? Isa. 56:7; Lev. 19 : 30 ; Hab. 2:20.
    NOTE.—"God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to
be had in reverence of all them that are about Him." Ps. 89: 7. "Give unto the
Lord the glory due unto His name: bring an offering, and come into His courts.
0 worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness: fear before Him, all the earth."
Ps. 96:8, 9. 1 Chron. 16:29 bears out a similar thought.
    "The reverence which the people had anciently for the sanctuary where
they met with God in sacred service, has largely passed away. Nevertheless,
God Himself gave the order of His service, exalting it high above everything
of a temporal nature. . . .
    "If some have to wait a few minutes before the meeting begins, let them
maintain a true spirit of devotion by silent meditation, keeping the heart up-
lifted to God in prayer that the service may be of special benefit to their own
hearts, and lead to the conviction and conversion of other souls. They should
remember that heavenly messengers are in the house. We all lose much sweet
communion with God by our restlessness, by not encouraging moments of re-
flection and prayer."—Testimonies, vol. 5, pp. 491, 492.
     13. Against what are God's children admonished in these last days?
Heb. 10:25.
    Nora.—"Never entertain the thought that you can be Christians and yet,
withdraw within yourselves. Each one is a part of the great web of humanity,
and the nature and quality of your experience will be largely determined by
the experiences of those with whom you associate. Jesus says, 'Where two or
three are gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst' Matt. 18:20.
Then let us not forsake the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner
of some is; but exhort one another; and so much the more, as we see the day
approaching."—Testimonies, vol. 7, p. 190.
    14. When will all the earthly members of God's family be with Jesus
forevermore? John 14:2, 3; 1 Thess. 4:16, 17.
    NoiE.—When that happy clay comes, the earthly members of God's family
                                      [24.]
—purified, beautified, glorified—will have finished their course in this sin-
cursed earth, and will meet around the throne of God.
    "Christ is coming with clouds and with great glory. A multitude of shin-
ing angels will attend Him. He will come to raise the dead, and to change the
living saints from glory to glory. He will come to honor those who have loved
Him, and kept His commandments, and to take them to Himself. He has not
forgotten them nor His promise"—The Desire'of Ages, page 632.


                        Lesson 9, for May 30, 1942
                   The Christian in the World
    MEMORY VERSE: "Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world.
If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him." 1 John 2:15.
    STUDY HELPS: "Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing," pages 63-72; "Testi-
monies," vol. 5, pp. 202-207.
    SEED THOUGHT: "Christ's followers are to be more than a light in the midst of
men. They are the light of the world. Jesus says to all who have named His name,
You have given yourselves to Me, and I have given you to the world as My represent-
atives. As the Father had sent Him into the world, so, He declares, 'have I also sent
them into the world.' As Christ is the channel for the revelation of the Father, so we
are to be the channel for the revelation of Christ."—"Thoughts From the Mount of
Blessing," page 66.
    "You cannot affiliate with the world without becoming a partaker of its spirit, with-
out becoming guilty of treason against the Lord who has bought you."—Mrs. E. G.
White in "Review and Herald," Aug. 26, 1890.

                  The Christian's Aims and Prospects
    1. What prospects are before the Christian? Matt. 5:5; James 2:5.
    NOTE.—"After a recital of many of the beautiful visions of future glory for
the Christian, the inspired pen addresses the Christian living today thus:
    "He who died for the sins of the world, is opening wide the gates of paradise
to all who believe on Him. Soon the battle will have been fought, the victory
won. Soon we shall see Him in whom our hopes of eternal life are centered.
And in His presence the trials and sufferings of this life will seem as nothing-
ness. . . .
    "Look up, look up, and let your faith continually increase. Let this faith
guide you along the narrow path that leads through the gates of the city into
the great beyond, the wide, unbounded future of glory that is for the redeemed."
—Prophets and Kings, page 732.
     2. With such prospects, what should be the Christian's constant aim?
1 Thess. 5 : 23.
    NOTE.—"As you live His life, showing self-sacrifice at every step, con-
stantly revealing a stronger sympathy for those in need of help, you will gain
 victory after victory. Day by day you will learn better how to conquer self and
how to strengthen your weak points of character. The Lord Jesus will be your
light, your strength, your crown of rejoicing, because you yield your will to
His will
    "The Saviour calls upon you to deny self and take up the cross. Then noth-
 ing will prevent the development of the whole being. The daily experience will
 reveal healthy, harmonious action."—Testimonies, vol. 7, p. 49.

   3. Because of the dangers before the Christian, what does his heavenly
Father counsel him to do? 2 Peter 3:14; 1:10.
   NorE.—"If man lays hold of the divine nature, working upon the plan of
addition, adding grace to grace in perfecting a Christian character, God will
work upon the plan of multiplication."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 148.
                    Worldly Aims and Ambitions
    4. What three forms of worldly aims and ambitions are listed? 1 John
2:16.
    5. How do worldly ambitions affect the Christian's prospects for spirit-
ual advancement? Mark 4:19 (Luke 18:22-24); 1 John 4:5.
   NOTE.—"Those who profess to serve God, and yet make no advancement in
knowledge and piety, are Christians only in name. The soul temple is filled
with desecrated shrines. Frivolous reading, trifling conversation, and worldly
pleasure, occupy the mind so completely that there is no room left for the
entrance of God's word. Worldliness, frivolity, and pride take the place, which
Christ should occupy in the soul."—Messages to Young People, page 66.
               The Christian's Privileges and Duties
    6. What great privilege and responsibility has God given to every one
of His children? 1 Cor. 6:19, 20.
    NcerE.—"The service of God demands all the powers of our being, and we
fail of meeting the design of God unless we bring these powers to a high state
of cultivation, and educate the mind to love to contemplate heavenly things,
and strengthen and ennoble the energies of the soul by right actions, operating
to the glory of God."—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 187.
    7. What is the Christian's responsibility in his relation to others? 1
Tim. 4:12.
    NorE.—"Every day of life is freighted with responsibilities which we must
bear. Every day, our words and acts are making impressions upon those with
whom we associate. How great the need that we set a watch upon our lips and
guard carefully our steps ! . . .
    "The true follower of Christ strengthens the good purposes of all with
whom he comes in contact. Before an unbelieving, sin-loving world, he reveals
the power of God's grace and the perfection of His character."—Prophets and
Kings, page 348.
    8. In the Christian's relation to life, whose will and example should he
follow? John 6:38; 17:18.
                      Warnings to the Christian
   9. What definite command is given concerning the Christian's attitude
toward the world? How did Christ pray for His followers? 1 John 2:15;
John 17:14, 15.
   NOTE.—"There are many whose hearts are aching under a load of care
because they seek to reach the world's standard. They have chosen its service,
accepted its perplexities, adopted its customs. Thus their character is marred,
and their life made a weariness. . . . Our Lord desires them to lay aside this
yoke of bondage. He invites them to accept His yoke; He says, 'My yoke is
easy, and My blircITI iS       He bids them first seek the kingdom of God and
                                      [26 ]
His righteousness, and His promise is, that all things needful to them for this
life shall be added. Worry is blind, and cannot discern the future; but Jesus
sees the end from the beginning. In every difficulty He has His way prepared
to bring relief. Our heavenly Father has a thousand ways to provide for us,
of which we know nothing. Those who accept the one principle of making the
service and honor of God supreme, will find perplexities vanish, and a plain
path before their feet."—The Desire of Ages, page 330.
    10. How must the Christian guard his social activities? Eph. 5:11.
    No'rE.—"Christ did not refuse to mingle with others in friendly intercourse.
When invited to a feast by Pharisee or publican, He accepted the invitation.
On such occasions every word that He uttered was a savor of life unto life to
His hearers; for He made the dinner hour an occasion• of imparting many pre-
cious lessons adapted to their needs."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 173.
    "Especially should those who have tasted the love of Christ develop their
social powers, for in this way they may win souls to the Saviour."—Id., page
172.
    11. How will the destiny of every professed Christian be determined?
Gal. 6:7, 8.
    Nozi.—"Satan leads many to believe that God will overlook their unfaith-
fulness in the minor affairs of life; but the Lord shows in His dealings with
Jacob that He will in nowise sanction or tolerate evil. All who endeavor to
excuse or conceal their sins, and permit them to remain upon the books of
heaven, unconfessed and unforgiven, will be overcome by Satan. The more
exalted their profession, and the more honorable the position which they hold,
the more grievous is their course in the sight of God, and the more sure the
triumph of their great adversary. Those who delay a preparation for the day
of God cannot obtain it in the time of trouble, or at any subsequent time. The
case of all such is hopeless."—The Great Controversy, page 620.
                          Secret of Overcoming
    12. What is God's counsel to him who would overcome the love of the
world? Col. 3:1-4.
    13. What provision has God made whereby the Christian may have all
needed help for overcoming the world? 1 John 4:4; 5:4.
   NOTE.—"He [God] knows there are trials and dangers, and He deals with
us plainly. He does not propose to take His people out of a world of sin and
evil, but He points them to a never-failing refuge."—Steps to Christ, page 128.
    14. Then what must be the steadfast attitude of the Christian toward
the world? Rom. 13:11-14.
   NoTE.—"You cannot mingle with worldlings, and partake of their spirit,
and follow their example, and be at the same time a child of God."—Testi-
monies, vol. 2, p. 44.
    "Seventh-day Adventists have been chosen by God as a peculiar people,
separate from the world. By the great cleaver of truth He has cut them out
from the quarry of the world, and brought them into connection with Himself.
He has made them His representatives, and has called them to be ambassadors
for Him in the last work of salvation. The greatest wealth of truth ever en-
trusted to mortals, the most solemn and fearful warnings ever sent by God to
man, have been committed to them to be given to the world,"—Testimonies,
vol. 7, p. 138.

                         Lesson 10, for June 6, 1942
                  The Christian's Call to Service
     MEMORY VERSE: "Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but
 to minister, and to give His life a ransom for many." Matt. 20:28.
     STUDY HELP: "Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing," pages 119-150.
     SEED THOUGHT: "However short our service or humble our work, if in simple
 faith we follow Christ, we shall not be disappointed of the reward. That which even
 the greatest and wisest cannot earn, the weakest and most humble may receive. Heav-
 en's golden gate opens not to the self-exalted. It is not lifted up to the proud in spirit.
 But the everlasting portals will open wide to the trembling touch of a little child.
 Blessed will be the recompense of grace to those who have wrought for God in the sim-
 plicity of faith and love."—"Christ's Object Lessons," page 404.

                                 Called to Service
     1. In what way is Christ's life an example of helpfulness to others?
 Matt. 20:27, 28; Acts 10:38.
     NOTE.—"As the rays of the sun penetrate to the remotest corners of the
 globe, so. God designs that the light of the gospel shall extend to every soul
 upon the earth. If the church of Christ were fulfilling the purpose of our
 Lord, light would be shed upon all that sit in darkness and in the region and
 shadow of death. Instead of congregating together and shunning responsibility
 and cross bearing, the members of the church would scatter into all lands, let-
 ting the light of Christ shine out from them, working as He did for the salva-
 tion of souls, and this 'gospel of the kingdom' would speedily be carried to all
 the world."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, pages 69, 70.
     2. With whom is the Christian united in service? What is his work?
1 Cor. 3:9; 2 Cor. 5:17-20.
    NoiE.—"Angels of heaven are commissioned to co-operate with the efforts
 of God's appointed messengers on earth."—Testimonies, vol. 7, p. 35.
    3. To how many has an individual work been assigned? Mark 13:34.
    NOTE.—"Christ's followers have been redeemed for service. . . . He gives
`to every man his work.' Each has his place in the eternal plan of heaven. Each
is to work in co-operation with Christ for the salvation of souls. Not more
surely is the place prepared for us in the heavenly mansions than is the special
place designated on earth where we are to work for God."—Christ's Object
Lessons, pages 326, 327.
                          Kinds of Work to Be Done
     4. What are important features of our missionary work? 1 Peter 4:9,
_10; Isa. 58:6, 7.
     5. What emphasis does God place on Christian help work? James 1:27;
2:14, 17.
    NOTE.—"In placing among them the helpless and the poor, to be depend-
 ent upon their care, Christ tests His professed followers. By our love and
 service for His needy children we prove the genuineness of our love for Him.
 To neglect them is to dedare ourselves false disciples, strangers to Christ and
 His love." —Ministry of Healing, page 205.
                                     [ 28
    6. How should the Christian work for his neighbors and friends? John
1:40-42.
    NoTE.—"Let the members of every church feel it their special duty to labor
for those in their neighborhood. Let each one who claims to stand under the
banner of Christ feel that he has entered into covenant relation with God, to
do the work of the Saviour. Let not those who take up this work become
weary in well-doing. When the redeemed stand before God, precious souls
will respond to their names who are there because of the faithful, patient efforts
put forth in their behalf, the entreaties and earnest persuasions to flee to the
Stronghold. Thus those who in this world have been laborers together with
God will receive their reward."—Testimonies, vol. 8, pp. 196, 197.
                              Secret of Success
     7. To be pre-eminently successful in service, what must the Christian
 do? Matt. 4:19.
     NOTE.—"Learning, talents, eloquence, every natural or acquired endow-
 ment, may be possessed; but without the presence of the Spirit of God, no
'heart will be touched, no sinner be won to Christ. On the other hand, if they
 are connected with Christ, if the gifts of the Spirit are theirs, the poorest and
 most ignorant of His disciples will have a power that will tell upon hearts. God
 makes them the channel for the outworking of the highest influence in the
 universe."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 328.
     Speaking of the work of the apostles, we read, "So long as they obeyed His
 word, and worked in connection with Him, they could not fail."—The Acts of
 of the Apostles, page 29.
     8. What spirit permeates all true service? 2 Cor. 5:14, first part; 12:15.
     NOTE.—"Love will be revealed in sacrifice. The plan of redemption was
 laid in sacrifice,—a sacrifice so broad and deep and high that it is immeasurable.
 Christ gave all for us, and those who receive Christ will be ready to sacrifice
 all for the sake of their Redeemer. The thought of His honor and glory will
 come before anything else."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 49.
     9. How deep was Paul's love for his brethren? Rom. 9:1-3.
     NorE.—"The value of a soul, who can estimate? Would you know its
 worth, go to Gethsemane, and there watch with Christ through those hours of
 anguish, when He sweat as it were great drops of blood. Look upon the Sav-
 iour uplifted on the cross. Hear that despairing cry, 'My God, My God, why
 hast Thou forsaken Me?' Look upon the wounded head, the pierced side, the
 marred feet. Remember that Christ risked all. For our redemption, heaven
 itself was imperiled. At the foot of the cross, remembering that for one sinner
 Christ would have laid down His life, you may estimate the value of a soul.
     "If you are in communion with Christ, you will place His estimate upon
 every human being. You will feel for others the same deep love that Christ has
 felt for you. Then you will be able to win, not drive, to attract, not repulse,
 those for whom He died."—Christ's Object Lessons, pages 196, 197.
                    Heaven's Interest and Rewards
   10. What great reward awaits the faithful soul winner in the hereafter?
Dan. 12:3; Luke 18:29, 30.                    ‘.
   11. How deeply interested is heaven in the salvation of the lost? Luke
15:6, 7.
                                       [ 29 ]
   NorE.—"Divine love has been stirred to its unfathomable depths for the
sake of men, and angels marvel to behold in the recipients of so great love a
mere surface gratitude. Angels marvel at man's shallow appreciation of the
love of God. Heaven stands indignant at the neglect shown to the souls of men."
—The Desire of Ages, page 825.
    12. How does Christ regard even the humblest service? Matt. 25:35-40.
    NOTE.—"It is not the length of time we labor, but our willingness and
fidelity in the work, that makes it acceptable to God. In all our service a full
surrender of self is demanded. The smallest duty done in sincerity and self-
forgetfulness, is more pleasing to God than the greatest work when marred
with self-seeking. He looks to see how much of the spirit of Christ we cherish,
and how much of the likeness of Christ our work reveals. He regards more
the love and faithfulness with which we work than the amount we do."—
Christ's Object Lessons, page 402.
                            The Call of the Hour
    13. What cry comes today with increasing urgency from every part of
the earth? Acts 16:9; John 12:20, 21; Isa. 60:3, 4.
    Nora—"The work which the church has failed to do in a time of peace
and prosperity, she will have to do in a terrible crisis, under most discourag-
ing, forbidding circumstances. The warnings that worldly conformity has
silenced or withheld, must be given under the fiercest opposition from enemies
of the faith."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 463.
    14. What call comes to each member of the church today? Matt.
21: 28-31.
    NotE.—"The word is given from the throne of God, 'Every man to his
work, each to do his best' "—Special Testimonies, No. 11, p. 30.
    "No district is to be neglected. Any region that is left in darkness testifies
to our unfaithfulness."—Mrs. E. G. White, An Appeal for Missions, pages
15, 16.

                      Lesson 11, for June 13, 1942
                   The Christian as a Steward
   MEMORY VERSE: "What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy
Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? For ye are
bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are
God's." 1 Cot. 6:19, 20.
   STUDY HELP: "The Acts of the Apostles," pages 335-345.
   SEED THOUGHT: "The real character of the church is measured, not by the
high profession she makes, not by the names enrolled upon the church book, but by
what she is actually doing for the Master, by the number of her persevering, faithful
workers. Personal interest, and vigilant, individual effort will accomplish more for the
cause of Christ than can be wrought by sermons or creeds."—Mrs. E. G. White, in the
"Review and Herald," Sept. 6, 1881.

                 God's Ownership and Goodness
    1. How extensive is God's ownership in this world? Ps. 24:1; Haggai
2:8; Ps. 50:10-12.
                                         [80 1
    NoTE.—"All things are God's, not only by creation, but by redemption. All
the blessings of this life and of the life to come, are delivered to us stamped
with the cross of Calvary."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 362.
    2. To whom do the people of the earth, with their time, talent, and
strength, belong? 1 Cor. 6:19, 20; Isa. 43:1.
    3. How is God ever demonstrating His loving care for man and beast?
Acts 14:15-17; Ps. 145:15, 16.
    NOTE.-" 'God is love,' is written upon every opening bud, upon every
spire of springing grass. The lovely birds making the air vocal with their happy
songs, the delicately tinted flowers in their perfection perfuming the air, the
lofty trees of the forest with their rich foliage of living green,—all testify to
the tender, fatherly care of our God, and to His desire to make His children
happy."—Steps to Christ, page 10.
    4. How are men enabled to acquire means and succeed in their under-
takings? Deut. 8:17, 18; Prov. 10:22.
    5. What great truth are many of God's professed people prone to forget?
Deut. 8:11-14, 18.
    NorE.—"Too often those who possess worldly treasure forget that it is God
who gives them power to get wealth. They say, 'My power and the might of
mine hand hath gotten me this wealth.' Their riches, instead of awakening
gratitude to God, lead to the exaltation of self. They lose the sense of their
dependence upon God and their obligation to their fellow men. Instead of re-
garding wealth as a talent to be employed for the glory of God and the uplift-
ing of humanity, they look upon it as a means of serving themselves. Instead
of developing in man the attributes of God, riches thus used are developing in
him the attributes of Satan. The seed of the word is choked with thorns."—
Christ's Object Lessons, page 52.
                    Reminders of God's Ownership
    6. In the garden of Eden, what constant reminder of God's ownership
did Adam and Eve have? Gen. 2:16, 17.
   NorE.—"The Lord created every tree in Eden pleasant to the eyes and good
for food, and He bade Adam and Eve freely enjoy His bounties. But He made
one exception. Of the tree of knowledge of good and evil they were not to eat.
This tree God reserved as a constant reminder of His ownership of all. Thus
He gave them opportunity to demonstrate their faith and trust in Him by their
perfect obedience to His requirements."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 386.
    7. How were the patriarchs asked to acknowledge God's ownership and
His loving care? Lev. 27:30; Prov. 3:9.
    NorE.—"The tithing system reaches back beyond the days of Moses. Men
were required to offer to God gifts for religious purposes before the definite
system was given to Moses, even as far back as the days of Adam. In comply-
ing with God's requirements, they were to manifest in offerings their apprecia-
tion of His mercies and blessings to them. This was continued through suc-
cessive generations, and was carried out by Abraham, who gave tithes to
Melchisedec, the priest of the most high God. The same principle existed in
the days of Job. Jacob, when at Bethel, an exile and penniless wanderer, lay
down at night, solitary and alone, with a rock for his pillow, and there promised
the Lord, 'Of all that Thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto
                                      [ 31 ]
Thee.' God does not compel men to give. All that they give must be voluntary.
He will not have His treasury replenished with unwilling offerings."—Testi-
monies, vol. 3, p. 393.
              The Christian's Relation to God's Work
     8. Aside from his prayers (Luke 10:2) and his personal service (2 Cor.
5:20; 1 Cor. 10:31) how may the Christian co-operate with God for the
finishing of His work on earth? Mal. 3:10, first part; 1 Cor. 9:7-14.
    NorE.—"Very precious to God is His work in the earth. Christ and heav-
enly angels are watching it every moment."—Counsels to Teachers, page 532.
In order that His work may prosper and move forward with speed and power,
God has required of His children that they return to Him for the work to
which He has dedicated it, the tithes and offerings, an acknowledgment that
all things here on earth are His. The tithes and offerings He not only requires
at the hands of His children, but their willing service as His witnesses (Isa. 43:
10, 12 ; Matt. 28:18-20) as well. Every man who receives of the bounties of
God is by his receiving of God's gifts in debt to both his Maker and to every
man in need. God supplies the spiritual and physical needs of men through our
tithes and offerings and through our willing and loyal service in behalf of others.
     9. What is the divine standard for individual giving? Against what are
we warned? 2 Cor. 8:12; 1 Cor. 16:2; Luke 12:15.
     NorE.—"Many would be surprised to see how much could be saved for the
cause of God by acts of self-denial. The small sums saved by deeds of sacrifice
will do more for the upbuilding of the cause of God than larger gifts will ac-
complish that have not called for denial of self ."—C ounsels on Health, page 131.
    "God has made the proclamation of the gospel dependent upon the labors
and the gifts of His people. Voluntary offerings and the tithe constitute the
revenue of the Lord's work."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 74.
                          The Call of the Hour
    10. What arousing call comes to the stewards of God's blessings in this
last dark hour? Isa. 60:1, 2.
    NorE.—"Vigilance and fidelity have been required of Christ's followers in
every age; but now that we are standing upon the very verge of the eternal
world, holding the truths we do, having so great light, so important a work,
we must double our diligence. Everyone is to do to the very utmost of his
ability. My brother, you endanger your own salvation if you hold back now.
God will call you to account if you fail in the work He has assigned you."—
Testimonies, vol. 5, pp. 460, 461.
    11. What words of Christ to His disciples are particularly applicable to
God's children today? John 4:35.
    NorE.—"Never was there greater need of earnest, self-sacrificing labor in
the cause of Christ than now, when the hours of probation are fast closing, and
the last message of mercy is to be given to the world. My soul is stirred within
me as the Macedonian cry comes from every direction."—Testimonies, vol.
5, p. 732.
    12. What will be the reward of the steward who renders faithful, sac-
rificial service for God during this closing hour? Matt. 25:23.
    NOTE.—"While the great final reward is given at Christ's coming, true-
                                      r 82
hearted service for God brings a reward, even in this life. Obstacles, opposition,
and bitter, heartbreaking discouragements, the worker will have to meet. He
may not see the fruit of his toil. But in face of all this he finds in his labor a
blessed recompense. All who surrender themselves to God in unselfish service
for humanity are in co-operation with the Lord of glory. This thought sweetens
all toil, it braces the will, it nerves the spirit for whatever may befall."—
Testimonies, vol. 6, pp. 305, 306.


                       Lesson 12, for June 20, 1942

                The Christian and the Sabbath
    MEMORY VERSE: "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt
thou labor, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy
God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man-
servant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:
for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and
rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it."
Ex. 20:8-11.
    STUDY HELP: "Testimonies," vol. 6, pp. 349-360.
    SEED THOUGHT: "It means eternal salvation to keep the Sabbath holy unto
the Lord. God says, 'Them that honor Me I will honor.' 1 Sam. 2:30."—"Testi-
monies," vol. 6, p. 356.

                        Creation and Its Memorial
   1. What great act distinguishes the true God from all false gods? Jer.
10:10-12.
    2. Who was associated with the Father in this great act of creation?
John 1:1-3, 10.
   NorE.—"The Sovereign of the universe was not alone in His work of benef-
icence. He bad an assodate,—a co-worker who could appreciate His purposes,
and could share His joy in giving happiness to created beings. 'In the begin-
ning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The
same was in the beginning with God.' Christ, the Word, the only begotten of
God, was one with the eternal Father,—one in nature, in character, in purpose,
—the only being that could enter into all the counsels and purposes of God."—
Patriarchs and Prophets, page 34.
    3. What memorial was erected at the close of creation week, designed
to preserve man's knowledge of and his loyalty to the true God? Gen. 2:1-3.
    NorE.—"In Eden, God set up the memorial of His work of creation, in
placing His blessing upon the seventh day. The Sabbath was committed to
Adam, the father and representative of the whole human family. Its observance
was to be an act of grateful acknowledgment, on the part of all who should
dwell upon the earth, that God was their creator and their rightful sovereign;
that they were the work of His hands, and the subjects of His authority. Thus
the institution was wholly commemorative, and given to all mankind. There
was nothing in it shadowy, or of restricted application to any people."—
Patriarchs and Prophets, page 48.
                                     ( sal
     4. For whom was the Sabbath made? Which day is the Lord's day?
Mark 2:27, 28; Ex. 20:10.
     5. In making the Sabbath, what three specific things were done? Gen.
2:3.
    NorE.-1. God rested from all His work; 2. He sanctified the Sabbath;
3. He blessed the Sabbath. God "rested, not as one weary, but as well pleased
with the fruits of His wisdom and goodness and the manifestations of His
glory."- He "sanctified it or set it apart, as a day of rest for man." "God set
up the memorial of His work of creation, in placing His blessing upon the
seventh day."
     6. What evidence have we that God ceased His labors in creation, and
that He was not physically or mentally weary? Isa. 40:28.
     7. Besides rest, what experience came to God on the Sabbath of the new
creation? Ex. 31:17.
    NOTE.—"Was refreshed." "The Sabbath was hallowed at the creation. As
ordained for man, it had its origin when 'the morning stars sang together, and
all the sons of God shouted for joy.' Peace brooded over the world; for earth
was in harmony with heaven. 'God saw everything that He had made, and,
behold, it was very good;' and He rested in the joy of His completed work."—
The Desire of Ages, page 281.
                The Sabbath a Sign of God's Power
    8. Of what was the Sabbath a sign? Ezek. 20:20, 12; Ex. 31:13.
    Nora.—"Because He had rested upon the Sabbath, 'God blessed the sev-
enth day, and sanctified it'—set it apart to a holy use. He gave it to Adam as a
day of rest. It was a memorial of the work of creation, and thus a sign of God's
power and His love."—The Desire of Ages, page 281.
   "The observance of the Sabbath is the sign between God and His people.
Let us not be ashamed to bear the sign that distinguishes us from the world....
    "The Sabbath is ever the sign that distinguishes the obedient from the
disobedient. With masterly power Satan has worked to make null and void
the fourth commandment, that the sign of God may be lost sight of"—
Testimonies, vol. 7, p. 105.
    9. By what divinely appointed instrument is the knowledge of God re-
vealed and the work of sanctification accomplished? Heb. 8:8, 10-12.
   NoTE.—"The covenant of grace was first made with man in Eden, when
after the fall, there was given a divine promise that the seed of the woman
should bruise the serpent's head. To all men this covenant offered pardon, and
the assisting grace of God for future obedience through faith in Christ. It also
promised them eternal life on condition of fidelity to God's law. Thus the
patriarchs received the hope of salvation."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 370.
    10. Before the law of God is written in the heart, what takes place?
By what means is the writing accomplished? Ezek. 36:26, 27; 2 Cor. 3:3.
    11. How is the Sabbath related to the new, or perpetual, covenant?
Ex. 31:16, 17.
   Nora.—"To us as to Israel the Sabbath is given 'for a perpetual covenant.'
To those who reverence His holy day the Sabbath is a sign that God recognizes
them as His chosen people. It is a pledge that He will fulfill to them His cove-
                                     [ 34 ]
nant. Every soul who accepts the sign of God's government places himself
under the divine, everlasting covenant. He fastens himself to the golden chain
of obedience, every link of which is a promise."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 350.
                         True Sabbathkeeping
    12. How is the Sabbath to be kept? What will the Sabbath be to the
one who honors God by keeping it holy? Ex. 20:8-11; Isa. 58:13.
    Nom.—"God requires that His holy day be as sacredly observed now as
in the time of Israel. The command given to the Hebrews should be regarded
by all Christians as an injunction from Jehovah to them. The day before the
Sabbath should be made a day of preparation, that everything may be in
readiness for its sacred hours. In no case should our own business be allowed
to encroach upon holy time."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 296.
    13. What will be the results to the true Sabbathkeeper? Isa. 58:14.
    NozE.—"To all who receive the Sabbath as a sign of Christ's creative and
redeeming power, it will be a delight. Seeing Christ in it, they delight them-
selves in Him. The Sabbath points them to the works of creation as an evi-
dence of His mighty power in redemption. While it rails to mind the lost peace
of Eden, it tells of peace restored through the Saviour. And every object in
 nature repeats His invitation, 'Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy-
laden, and I will give you rest.' "—The Desire of Ages, page 289.
                         The Supreme Test
    14. In God's last message to the world, what startling announcement
is made? What appeal for worship is sounded everywhere? Rev. 14:6, 7.
    NOTE.-" The importance of the Sabbath as a memorial of creation is that
it keeps ever present the true reason why worship is due to God,'—because
He is the Creator, and we are His creatures. 'The Sabbath, therefore, lies at
the very foundation of divine worship; for it teaches this great truth in the
most impressive manner, and no other institution does this. The true ground
of divine worship, not of that on the seventh day merely, but of all worship,
is found in the distinction between the Creator and His creatures. This great
fact can never become obsolete, and must never be forgotten.' . . . The keep-
ing of the Sabbath is a sign of loyalty to the true God, 'Him that made heaven,
and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.' It follows that the mes-
sage which commands men to worship God and keep His commandments, will
especially call upon them to keep the fourth commandment."—The Great
 Controversy, pages 437, 438.
    15. On pain of death, what opposing worship and mark will be decreed?
Rev. 13:15-17.
    16. What warning is sent from God against such false worship? What
glorious victory is won by those who heed God's message? Rev. 14:9, 10;
15:2,3.
    NoTE.—"Fearful is the issue to which the world is to be brought. The
powers of earth, uniting to war against the commandments of God, will decree
that all, 'both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond,' shall conform
to the customs of the church by the observance of the false sabbath. All who
refuse compliance will be visited with civil penalties, and it will finally be
declared that they are deserving of death. On the other hand, the law of God
                                      [36]
enjoining the Creator's rest day demands obedience, and threatens wrath
against all who transgress its precepts.
   "With the issue thus clearly brought before him, whoever shall trample
upon God's law to obey a human enactment, receives the mark of the beast;
he accepts the sign of allegiance to the power which he chooses to obey instead
of God."—The Great Controversy, page 604.


                       Lesson 13, for June 27, 1942
                          Walking With Jesus
    MEMORY VERSE: "Can two walk together, except they be agreed?" Amos 3:3.
    STUDY HELP: "The Ministry of Healing," pages 469-482, 503-516.
    SEED THOUGHT: "Many fail of imitating our holy Pattern, because they study
so little the definite features of that character. So many are full of busy plans, always
active, and there is no time. or place for the precious Jesus to be a close, dear compan-
ion. They do not refer every thought and action to Him, inquiring, 'Is this the way of
the Lord?' If they did, they would walk with God, as did Enoch."—"Testimonies,"
vol. 6, p. 393.
                       Standard for God's Children
     1. In order to reach the exalted standard set for the children of God
(Matt. 5:48), what must the Christian do? Micah 6:8; Gen. 5:24.
    NOTE.—"Enoch's walk with God was not in a trance or a vision, but in all
the duties of his daily life. He did not become a hermit, shutting himself en-
tirely from the world; for he had, in the world, a work to do for God. In the
family and in his intercourse with men, as a husband and father, a friend, a
citizen, he was the steadfast, unwavering servant of God.
    "In the midst of a life of active labor, Enoch steadfastly maintained his
communion with God. The greater and more pressing his labors, the more
constant and earnest were his prayers. He continued to exclude himself at
certain periods from all society."—Gospel Workers, pages 51, 52.
     2. What unfailing demonstration do we have of this true Christian
life—this humble walk with God? 1 Peter 2:21; 1 John 2:6.
    NorE.—"Christ, the true temple for God's indwelling, molded every detail
of His earthly life in harmony with God's ideal."—The Desire of Ages, page 209.
    "His perfect humanity is that which all His followers may possess, if they
will be in subjection to God as He was."—Id., page 664.
     3. What do the Scriptures say of the life of Jesus?
    ANSWER:
    1. He walked with His heavenly Father. 2 Cor. 5:19; Acts 10:38, last part.
    2. He purposed to do His Father's will. John 6:38.
    3. He was often in prayer. Mark 1:35; Luke 5:16.
    4. He studied the Bible plan for His life. Luke 24:27.
    5. He was fully absorbed in God's business. John 4:34.
    6. He accepted power from the Holy Spirit for service. Acts 10:38; Matt.
3:16.
    1, He sacrificed ALL to save sinners. 2 Cor. 8:9.
    8. He got His daily program from God every morning. Isa. 50:4.
    IsloTE.—"From hours spent with God He came forth morning by morning,
                                      [86 1
to bring the light of heaven to men. Daily He received a fresh baptism of the
Holy Spirit. In the early hours of the new day the Lord awakened Him from
His slumbers, and His soul and His lips were anointed with grace, that He
might impart to others. His words were given Him fresh from the heavenly
courts, words that He might speak in season to the weary and oppressed."—
Christ's Object Lessons, page 139.
                        Companionship With Jesus
    4. What will Jesus do for those who choose His companionship through
the walk of life, and upon what conditions? John 14:23.
    NOTE.—"The spell of a stronger, a perfect, mind will be over us; for we
have a living connection with the source of all-enduring strength. In our di-
vine life we shall be brought into captivity to Jesus Christ. We shall no longer
live the common life of selfishness, but Christ will live in us. His character
will be reproduced in our nature."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 61.
    5. How fully will Jesus satisfy the hungry, lonely hearts of His fol-
lowers? John 15:11.
    NoTE.—"The Lord would have all His sons and daughters happy, peaceful,
and obedient. . . . Christians may have the joy of communion with Christ;
they may have the light of His love, the perpetual comfort of His presence.
Every step in life may bring us closer to Jesus, may give us a deeper experience
of His love, and may bring us one step nearer to the blessed home of peace.
Then let us not cast away our confidence, but have firm assurance, firmer than
ever before."—Steps to Christ, page 130.
     6. What special victory does Jesus promise to His companions? 2 Cor.
10:5, last part; Phil. 4:7.
    NOTE.—"By His perfect obedience He has made it possible for every human
being to obey God's commandments. When we submit ourselves to Christ,
 the heart is united with His heart, the will is merged in His will, the mind be-
 comes one with His mind, the thoughts are brought into captivity to Him;
 we live His life. This is what it means to be clothed with the garment of His
 righteousness. Then as the Lord looks upon us,He sees, not the fig-leaf gar-
 ment; not the nakedness and deformity of sin,t uHis own robe of righteous-
 ness, which is perfect obedience to the law of Jehovah."—Christ's Object
 Lessons, page 312.
     7. Why can the Christian who walks faithfully with Jesus face life's
 problems courageously? Phil. 4:19; 2 Tim. 1:12.
     NorE.—"Jesus does not call on us to follow Him, and then forsake us. If
 we surrender our lives to His service, we can never be placed in a position for
 which God has not made provision. Whatever may be our situation; we have
 a Guide to direct our way; whatever our perplexities, we have a sure Counselor ;
 whatever our sorrow, bereavement, or loneliness, we have a sympathizing
 Friend. If in our ignorance we make missteps, Christ does not leave us. His
 voice clear and distinct, is heard, saying, 'I am the way, the truth, and the life.' "
 —Gospel Workers, page 263.
                   Evidences of Walking With Jesus
   8. What evidence was seen in Paul's life of his close walk with Jesus?
Phil. 3:7-10; Gal. 2:20.
   NOTE.—"Paul carried with him the atmosphere of heaven. All who as-_
                                         I S7
sociated with him felt the influence of his union with Christ. The fact that
his own life exemplified the truth he proclaimed, gave convincing power to his
preaching. Here lies the power of the truth. The unstudied, unconscious in-
fluence of a holy life is the most convincing sermon that can be given in favor
of Christianity. Argument, even when unanswerable, may provoke only op-
position; but a godly example has a power that it is impossible wholly to resist."
—Gospel Workers, page 59.
    9. How did Paul manage to keep step with Jesus when he was hemmed
in by seemingly insurmountable obstacles? Phil. 3:13, 14.
    NorE.—Of Paul it is said, "His faith, made strong by effort and pure by
sacrifice, upheld and strengthened him."—Gospel Workers, page 108.
    "Amidst the constant storm of opposition, the clamor of enemies, and the
desertion of friends, the intrepid apostle almost lost heart. But he looked back
to Calvary, and with new ardor pressed on to spread the knowledge of the
 Crucified. He was but treading the bloodstained path that Christ had trodden
 before him. He sought no discharge from the warfare till he should lay off
his armor at the feet of his Redeemer."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 297.
    10. What will be the all-absorbing concern of those who walk with Je-
sus? 1 John 2:6; Acts 10:38.
    N0TE.—"Jesus did not consider heaven a place to be desired while we were
lost. He left the heavenly courts for a life of reproach and insult, and a death
of shame. He who was rich in heaven's priceless treasure became poor, that
through His poverty we might be rich. We are to follow in the path He trod.
    "He who becomes a child of God should henceforth look upon himself as
a link in the chain let down to save the world, one with Christ in His plan of
mercy, going forth with Him to seek and save the lost."—The Ministry of
Healing, page 105.
    11. How will the Christian's words as well as his service reveal his com-
panionship with Jesus? Ps. 145:10-12.
    Nom.—"Angels are listening to hear what kind of report you are bearing
to the world about your heavenly Master. Let your conversation be of Him
who liveth to make intercession for you before the Father. When you take
the hand of a friend, let praise to God be on your lips and in your heart. This
will attract his thoughts to Jesus."—Steps to Christ, page 124.

                          The End of the Way
    12. What will a continued walk with Jesus do for the Christian? 1 John
1:7; 3:1, 2.
    NorE.—"In His prayer to the Father, Christ gave to the world a lesson
which should be graven on mind and soul. 'This is life eternal,' He said, `that
they might know Thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast
sent' This is true education. It imparts power. The experimental knowledge
of God and of Jesus Christ whom He has sent, transforms man into the image
of God. It gives to man the mastery of himself, bringing every impulse and
passion of the lower nature under the control of the higher powers of the mind.
It makes its possessor a son of God and an heir of heaven. It brings him into
communion with the mind of the Infinite, and opens to him the rich treasures
of the universe."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 114.
                                      [ 88 ]
    13. What inheritance awaits the friends of Jesus who have followed
Him faithfully? Rev. 21:7.
    NOTE.—"Tell it over and over again. We may become the sons of God,
members of the royal family, children of the heavenly King. Let it be known
that all who accept Jesus Christ and hold the beginning of their confidence
firm to the end, will be heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ, 'to an in-
heritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in
heaven for you, who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salva-
tion ready to be revealed in the last time.' 1 Peter 1:4, 5"—Testimonies, vol.
6, p. 60.
    14. What will be the grand climax of a walk on earth with Jesus? John
17:24; 1 Thess. 4:17, last part.
    NoTE.—"Enoch had temptations as well as we. He was surrounded with
society no more friendly to righteousness than is that which surrounds us. The
atmosphere he breathed was tainted with sin and corruption, the same as ours;
yet he lived a life of holiness. He was unsullied with the prevailing sins of the
age in which he lived. So may we remain pure and uncorrupted. He was a
representative of the saints who live amid the perils and corruptions of the
last days. For his faithful obedience to God, he was translated. So, also, the
faithful, who are alive and remain, will be translated. They will be removed
from a sinful and corrupt world to the pure joys of heaven."—Testimonies,
vol. 2, p. 122.

   THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING, June 27

T   HE recipients of the "overflow" for the second quarter are the
      missions of the Southern European Division—those of North
Africa. This field is a difficult one, the majority of the population
being Mohammedans, but among them are many honest people
who must be reached with the gospel message. A good work has
been established, but their greatest need is the construction of
chapels where our people may meet to worship. In the city of
Algiers our people meet in a hall, but it is like an oven in summer
and an icebox in winter, with no way for ventilation during the
summer months, and no way to heat the hall during the cold.
   In 1940, when last we gave to the missions of the Southern
European Division, the "overflow" of the Thirteenth Sabbath
Offering amounted to $8,118.75. This was greatly appreciated in
that field, and helped to meet urgent needs in Madagascar, Mauri-
tius, etc.
   Our Sabbath school members should rally in giving a large
offering to this field on June 27, that the hopes of our people for
the construction of a suitable place of worship in Algiers and other
places may be realized. "As God hath prospered" should be your
goal, but at least a dollar a church member is anticipated!
