            The Life and Teachings of Jesus


                     Lesson 1, for April 6, 1946
             Jesus Begins His Public Ministry
   LESSON SCRIPTURE: John 2.
   MEMORY VERSE: "This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee,
and manifested forth His glory; and His disciples believed on Him." John 2:11.
   STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pages 144-163.

                      The Beginning of Miracles
   1. After a period of separation what family gathering brought
Jesus and His mother together? At what place did they meet? Who
were included among the guests? John 2:1, 2.
     2. Before the feast ended, what embarrassing situation arose?
To whom did Mary appeal? What reason did Jesus give for gently
reproving His mother's ambition? John 2:3, 4.
    NoTE.—"As a relative of the parties, Mary had assisted in the arrangements
for the feast, and she now spoke to Jesus, saying, 'They have no wine.' These
words were a suggestion that He might supply their need. But Jesus answered,
`Woman, what have Ito do with thee? Mine hour is not yet come.' . . .
    "In saying to Mary that His hour had not yet come, Jesus was replying
to her unspoken thought,—to the expectation she cherished in common with
her people. She hoped that He would reveal Himself as the Messiah, and take
the throne of Israel. But the time had not come. Not as a King, but as 'a Man
of Sorrows, and acquainted with grief,' had Jesus accepted the lot of hu-
manity."—The Desire of Ages, pages 145-147.
     3. What direction did Mary give to the servants? What instruc-
tion did Jesus then give? With what result? John 2:5-9.
    NOTE.—"Instead of the water with which the vessels had been filled, there
 flowed forth wine. . . . Upon tasting that which the servants brought, the
 ruler found it superior to any he had ever before drunk, and very different
 from that served at the beginning of the feast."—The Desire of Ages, page 148.
      4. What did the ruler of the feast say to the bridegroom? In
 this first miracle, what did Jesus make manifest, and with what
 result? John 2:10, 11.
     5. Following this experience, where did Jesus go? Who accom-
 panied Him? John 2:12.
    NorE.—At this time His disciples were James, John, Andrew, Peter, Phillip,
 and Nathanael.
                                      s
                       Cleansing the Temple
    6. Shortly after the miracle of Cana What important feast was
to be held? Where did Jesus go? John 2:13.
    7. Describe the scene that greeted the eye of Jesus as He entered
the temple courts. John 2:14.
   NOTE.-"A great number of sacrifices were offered at the time of the
Passover, and the sales at the temple were very large. The consequent con-
fusion indicated a noisy cattle market, rather than the sacred temple of God.
There could be heard sharp bargaining, the lowing of cattle, the bleating of
sheep, the cooing of doves, mingled with the thinking of coin and angry
disputation. So great was the confusion that the worshipers were disturbed,
and the words addressed to the Most High were drowned in the uproar
that invaded the temple. The Jews were exceedingly proud of their piety.
They rejoiced over their temple, and regarded a word spoken in its dis-
favor as blasphemy; they were very rigorous in the performance of cere-
monies connected with it; but the love of money had overruled their scruples.
They were scarcely aware how far they,had wandered from the original pur-
pose of the service instituted by God Himself."—The Desire of Ages, pages
155, 156.
  8. As Jesus beheld this scene of profanation of God's house,
what did He do? John 2:15-17.
   NorE.—"Christ spoke with the authority of a king, and in His appearance,
and in the tones of His voice, there was that which they had no power to
resist. At the word of command they realized, as they had never realized
before, their true position as hypocrites and robbers. When divinity flashed
through humanity, not only did they see indignation on Christ's countenance;
they realized the import of His words. They felt as if before the throne of
the eternal Judge, with their sentence passed on them for time and for eternity.
For a time they were convinced that Christ was a prophet; and many believed
Him to be the Messiah. The Holy Spirit flashed into their minds the utter-
ances of the prophets concerning Christ. Would they yield to this conviction?"
—The Desire of Ages, page 162.
    9. How did the Jews challenge the authority of Jesus? John
2:18.
   10. What reply did Jesus make? To what did the Jews under-
stand Him to refer? Of what did He speak? John 2:19-21.
   11. At what time were these words brought to the remembrance
of the disciples? What effect did it have upon them? John 2:22.
   12. While at the Passover what caused many to believe in the
name of Jesus? John 2:23.
   NoTE.—"The people pressed into Christ's presence with urgent, pitiful
appeals, Master, bless me. His ear beard every cry. With pity exceeding that
of a tender mother He bent over the suffering little ones. All received atten-
tion. Everyone was healed of whatever disease he had. The dumb opened
their lips in praise; the blind beheld the face of their Restorer. The hearts of
the sufferers were made glad."—The Desire of Ages, page 163.
  13. Why did Jesus not trust those who followed Him merely
because of His miracles? John 2:24, 25.
                                     [4]
                             The Body Temple
   14. For what purpose was the sanctuary and later the temple
built? What is God's purpose concerning every created being?
Ex. 25:8; 1 Cor..6:19, 20; 2 Cor. 6:16.
    NOTE.—"That temple [at Jerusalem], erected for the abode of the divine
Presence, was designed to be an object lesson for Israel and for the world.
From eternal ages it was God's purpose that every created being, from the
bright and holy seraph to man, should be a temple for the indwelling of the
Creator. Because of sin, humanity ceased to be a temple for God. Darkened
and defiled by evil, the heart of man no longer revealed the glory of the
Divine One. But by the incarnation of the Son of God, the purpose of Heaven
is fulfilled. God dwells in humanity, and through saving grace the heart of
man becomes again. His temple."—The Desire of Ages, page 161. Read Malachi
3:1-3.
    15. If a person defiles God's temple, what will be the result?
1 Cor. 3:16, 17.


                     Lesson 2, for April 13, 1946
          The New Birth; God's Gift of Love
   LESSON SCRIPTURE: John 3:1-17.
   MEMORY VERSE: "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten
Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life."
John 3:16.
   STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pages 167-177.

                        Nicodemus's Night Visit
    1. What man of high standing in. Jerusalem, under cover of
darkness, visited Jesus? How did he address the Master? John 3:1, 2.
   NOTE.—"Since hearing Jesus, Nicodemus had anxiously studied the proph-
ecies relating to the Messiah ; and the more he searched, the stronger was his
conviction that this was the One who was to come. With many others in
Israel he had been greatly distressed by the profanation of the temple. He
was a witness of the scene when Jesus drove out the buyers and the sellers;
he beheld the wonderful manifestation of divine power; he saw the Saviour
receiving the poor and healing the sick; he saw their looks of joy, and heard
their words of praise; and he could not doubt that Jesus of Nazareth was the
Sent of God."—The Desire of Ages, page 168.
     2. What reply did Jesus make to the confession of Nicodemus?
John 3:3, see margin.
    3. How did Nicodemus reveal that he did not fully compre-
hend the meaning of the Saviour's words? John 3:4.
    NoTE.—"The pride of the Pharisee was struggling against the honest desire
of the seeker after truth. He wondered that Christ should speak to him as
He did, not respecting his position as ruler in Israel."—The Desire of Ages,
page 171.
                                     (5 ]
     4. How did Jesus further emphasize the truth revealed? John
3:5-7.
    NOTE.—"Nicodemus knew that Christ here referred to water baptism
and the renewing of the heart by the Spirit of God. He was convinced that he
was in the presence of the One whom John the Baptist had foretold. . . .
Christ spoke with such solemn dignity, and both look and tone expressed such
earnest love, that Nicodemus was not offended as he realized his humiliating
condition."—The Desire of Ages, pages 172, 173.
     5. By what illustration did Jesus make clear His meaning?
John 3:8.
    NorE.—"By an agency as unseen as the wind, Christ is constantly working
upon the heart. Little by little, perhaps unconsciously to the receiver, im-
pressions are made that tend to draw the soul to Christ. These may be received
through meditating upon Him, through reading the Scriptures; or through
hearing the word -from the living preacher. Suddenly, as the Spirit comes with
more direct appeal, the soul gladly surrenders itself to Jesus. By many this
is called sudden conversion; but it is the result of long wooing by the Spirit of
God,—a patient, protracted process."—The Desire of Ages, page 172.
             Jesus Unfolds the Plan of Salvation
    6. What further question did Nicodemus ask? John 3:9.
     7. In what kindly way did Jesus endeavor to dispel the darkness
from his mind? John 3:10-13.
    NOTE.—"While Jesus was speaking, some gleams of truth penetrated the
ruler's mind. The softening, subduing influence of the Holy Spirit impressed
his heart. Yet he did not fully understand the Saviour's words. He was not so
much impressed by the necessity of the new birth as by the manner of its
accomplishment. He said wonderingly, 'How can these things be?' "—The
Desire of Ages, page 173.
    8. How did Jesus unfold to Nicodemus the plan of salvation
and His mission to the world? In what way was God's great love
for this. lost world revealed? John 3:14-17.
                     The Internal Cleansing
    9. What is the condition of the natural heart? Jer. 17:9; Rom.
8:7.
   10. What provision has been made for the regeneration of the
sinner? 2 Cor. 5:17.
   NorE.—"There is a new creation." R. V., margin.
   "If the heart has been renewed by the Spirit of God, the life will bear
witness to the fact. While we cannot do anything to change our hearts, or to
bring ourselves into harmony with God; while we must not trust at all to
ourselves or our good works, our lives will reveal whether the grace of God is
dwelling within us. A change will be seen in the character, the habits, the pur-
suits. The contrast will be clear and decided between what they have been
and what they are. The character is revealed, not by occasional good deeds
and occasional misdeeds, but by the tendency of the habitual words and acts."
—Steps to Christ, pages 61, 62.
                                     16]
  11. How had this transforming work in the human heart been
described in the Old Testament? Isa. 64:6; Ps. 51:10; Ezek. 36:26, 27.
   12. As a sequel to this interview, what later incident does John
relate concerning Nicodemus? John 19:39.
    NOTE.—"But Jesus was acquainted with the soil into which He cast the
seed. The words spoken at night to one listener in the lonely mountain were
not lost. For a time Nicodemus did not publicly acknowledge Christ, but he
watched His life, and pondered His teachings. In the Sanhedrin councils he
repeatedly thwarted the schemes of the priests to destroy Him. When at last
Jesus was lifted up on the cross, Nicodemus remembered the teaching upon
Olivet: 'As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the
Son of man be lifted up: that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish,
but have eternal life.' The light from that secret interview illumined the cross
upon Calvary, and Nicodemus saw in Jesus the world's Redeemer.
    "After the Lord's-ascension, when the disciples were scattered by persecu-
tion, Nicodemus came boldly to the front. He employed his wealth in sus-
taining the infant church that the Jews had expected to be blotted out at the
death of Christ. In the time of peril he who had been so cautious and ques-
tioning was firm as a rock, encouraging the faith of the disciples, and furnishing
means to carry forward the work of the gospel. He was scorned and persecuted
by those who had paid him reverence in other days. He became poor in this
world's goods; yet he faltered not in the faith which had its beginning in that
night conference with Jesus."—The Desire of Ages, pages 176, 177.


                      Lesson 3, for April 20, 1946
          Unfathomed Love; God's Messengers
    LESSON SCRIPTURE: John 3:16-36.
    MEMORY VERSE: "In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because
that God sent His only-begotten Son into the world, that we might live through Him."
1 John 4:9.
    STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pages 178-182.

                          God's Wondrous Love
    1. How has the Father revealed the depth of His love for the
world? For what purpose was this marvelous gift bestowed? John
3:16, 17.
   NOTE.—"What language could so forcibly express God's love for the human
family as it is expressed by the gift of His only-begotten Son for our redemp-
tion. The Innocent bore the chastisement of the guilty.. . .
   "Christ gave Himself, an atoning sacrifice, for the saving of a lost world.
He was treated as we deserve, in order that we might be treated as He deserves.
He was condemned for our sins, in which He had no share, that we might be
justified by His righteousness, in which we had no share. He suffered the
death which was ours, that we might receive the life which was His. 'With
His stripes we are healed.' Isa. 53:5."—Testimonies, vol. 8, pp. 208, 209.
    2. What experiences in the knowledge of God's love did Paul
long to see and realize in the life of the Christian? Eph. 3:14-19.
                                       [ 7]
    NOTE.—"Here are revealed the heights of attainment that we may reach
through faith in the promises of our heavenly Father, when we fulfill His
requirements. Through the merits of Christ, we have access to the throne of
Infinite Power."—The Great Controversy, page 477.
    3. How does faith or unbelief affect the results in individual
cases? John 3:18; Eph. 2:8, 9.
    4. What is the condemnation of the unbeliever? Why do some
love darkness and hate light? John 3:19, 20.
    5. Who only comes to the light? John 3:21.
    6. After His visit with Nicodemus where did Jesus and His dis-
ciples go? Who performed the rite of baptism? John 3:22; 4:2.
                John's Further Witness of Jesus
    7. What is said regarding the work of John the Baptist? John
3:23, 24.
    8. What question arose between some of John's disciples and
the Jews? John 3:25, 26.
   NorE.—"Through these words, Satan brought temptation upon John.
Though John's mission seemed about to close, it was still possible for him to
hinder the work of Christ. If he had sympathized with himself, and expressed
grief or disappointment at being superseded, he would have sown the seeds
of dissension, would have encouraged envy and jealousy, and would seriously
have impeded the progress of the gospel."—The Desire of Ages, pages 178, 179.
   9. By what magnanimous reply did John reveal true greatness?
John 3:27-30.
    NorE.—"John had by nature the faults and weaknesses common to hu-
manity, but the touch of divine love had transformed him. He dwelt in an
atmosphere uncontaminated with selfishness and ambition, and far above the
miasma of jealousy. He manifested no sympathy with the dissatisfaction of
his disciples, but showed how clearly he understood his relation to the Mes-
siah, and how gladly he welcomed the One for whom he had prepared the
way."—The Desire of Ages, page 179.

                       Messengers of God
  10. What contrast is drawn between Christ and teachers whose
knowledge is limited to things of earth? John 3:31-33.
  NOTE.—"Looking in faith to the Redeemer, John had risen to the height
of self-abnegation. He sought not to attract men to himself, but to lift their
thoughts higher and still higher, until they should rest upon the Lamb of
God. He himself had been only a voice, a cry in the wilderness. Now with
joy he accepted silence and obscurity, that the eyes of all might be turned to
the Light of life."—The Desire of Ages, page 180.
11. What did John say of the One whom God had sent? What
was given Him? How freely was the gift bestowed? John 3:34.
  NOTE.—"In this glory of Christ all His followers are to share. The Saviour
could say, 'I seek not Mine own will, but the will of the Father which bath
                                     [8]
sent Me.' And,' declared John, 'the Father giveth not the Spirit by measure
unto Him.' So with the followers of Christ. We can receive of heaven's light
only as we are willing to be emptied of self. We can discern the character of
God, and accept Christ by faith, only as we consent to the bringing into cap-
tivity of every thought to the obedience of Christ. To all who do this, the
Holy Spirit is given without measure. In Christ `dwelleth all the fullness of
the Godhead bodily. And ye are complete in Him.' "—Testimonies, vol. 8,
p. 334.
    12. How much has the Father given into the hands of His Son?
What is said of one who believes on the Son? Of one who does not
believe? John 3:35, 36.
    13. Where is this blessing of eternal life to be found? 1 John
5:11, 12.
    NOTE.—"As through Jesus we enter into rest, heaven begins here. We
respond to His invitation, Come, learn of Me, and in thus coming we begin the
life eternal."—The Desire of Ages, page 331.
    "Those who see Christ in His true character, and receive Him into the
heart, have everlasting life. It is through the Spirit that Christ dwells in us ;
and the Spirit of God, received into the heart by faith, is the beginning of the
life eternal."—Ibid., page 388.

   STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pages 183-191.

                       Breaking Down Prejudice
     1. After a season of untiring labor in Judea, why did Jesus
leave for Galilee? Through what province did He pass? John 4:1-4.
    NOTE.—"The success of Christ's work, which the Baptist had received
with such joy, was reported also to the authorities at Jerusalem. The priests
and rabbis had been jealous of John's influence as they saw the people leaving
the synagogues and flocking to the wilderness; but here was One who had
still greater power to attract the multitudes. . . .
    "Jesus knew that they would spare no effort to create a division between
His own disciples and those of John. He knew that the storm was gathering
which would sweep away one of the greatest prophets ever given to the world.
Wishing to avoid all occasion for misunderstanding or dissension, He quietly
ceased His labors, and withdrew to Galilee."—The Desire of Ages, page 181.
     2. In what city and at what particular place did Jesus stop for
rest? What was the time of His arrival? John 4:5, 6.
      3. At that time who came to the well and for what purpose?
What favor did Jesus ask of the woman? Where were the disciples?
John 4:7, 8.
                                     [9 ]
                                  Living Water
     4. How did the woman reveal her surprise at the request of
Jesus? What was His reply? John 4:9, 10.
     5. In her reply what indicates that she did not comprehend the
meaning of the Saviour's words? John 4:11, 12.
    NorE.—"She saw before her only a thirsty traveler, wayworn and dusty.
In her mind she compared Him with the honored patriarch Jacob. She cher-
ished the feeling, which is so natural, that no other well could be equal to that
provided by the fathers. She was looking backward to the fathers, forward
to the Messiah's coming,'while the Hope of the fathers, the Messiah Himself,
was beside her, and she knew Him not. How many thirsting souls are today
close by the living fountain, yet looking far away for the wellsprings of life !"—
The Desire of Ages, page 184.
     6. How did Jesus seek to arouse the interest of this woman in
the spiritual lesson He desired to impart? John 4:13, 14.
    NOTE.—"He who seeks to quench his thirst at the fountains of this world
will drink only to thirst again. Everywhere men are unsatisfied. They long
for something to supply the need of the soul. Only One can meet that want.
The need of the world, 'the Desire of all nations,' is Christ. The divine grace
which He alone can impart, is as living water, purifying, refreshing,•and in-
vigorating the soul.
    "Jesus did not convey the idea that merely one draft of the water of life
would suffice the receiver. He who tastes of the love of Christ will continually
long for more; but he seeks for nothing else. The riches, honors, and pleasures
of the world do not attract him. The constant cry of his heart is, More of
Thee. And He who reveals to the soul its necessity is waiting to satisfy its
hunger and thirst."—The Desire of Ages, page 187.
     7. How did the woman reveal that she still did not fully under-
stand the meaning of the Saviour's words? John 4:15.
    NOTE.—"As Jesus spoke of the living water, the woman looked upon Him
with wondering attention. He had aroused her interest, and awakened a desire
for the gift of which He spoke. She perceived that it was not the water of
Jacob's well to which He referred; for of this she used continually, drinking
and thirsting again. 'Sir,' she said, 'give me this water, that I thirst not,
neither come hither to draw.' "—The Desire of Ages, page 187.
     8. How did Jesus convince her that He could uncover the secrets
of her heart? John 4:16-18.
    NorE.—"The listener trembled. A mysterious hand was turning the pages
of her life history, bringing to view that which she had hoped to keep forever
hidden. Who was He that could read the secrets of her life? There came to
her thoughts of eternity, of the future judgment, when all that is now hidden
shall be revealed. In its light, conscience was awakened."—The Desire of Ages,
pages 187, 188.
     9. Of what was the woman now convinced? What long-existing
controversy between the Jews and Samaritans did she introduce?
 John 4:19, 20.
                                  True Worship
    10. To whom had the great truths of redemption been com-
mitted? What is true worship? John 4:21-24.
                                        [ to ]
   NOTE.—"The religion that comes from God is the only religion that will
lead to God. In order to serve Him aright, we must be born of the divine
Spirit. This will purify the heart and renew the mind, giving us a new capacity
for knowing and loving God. It will give us a willing obedience to all His
requirements. This is true worship. It is the fruit of the working of the Holy
Spirit. By the Spirit every sincere prayer is indited, and such prayer is
acceptable to God. Wherever a soul reaches out after God, there the Spirit's
working is manifest, and God will reveal Himself to that soul. For such wor-
shipers He is seeking. He waits to receive them, and to make them His sons
and daughters."—The Desire of Ages, page 189.
                 Light Breaking Through Darkness
   11. What deep conviction now came to this woman's heart?
What great truth did Jesus for the first time now clearly declare?.
John 4:25, 26.
   NOTE. "The plain statement made by Christ to this woman could not have
been made to the self-righteous Jews. Christ was far more reserved when He
spoke to them. That which had been withheld from the Jews, and which the
disciples were afterward enjoined to keep secret, was revealed to her. Jesus
saw that she would make use of her knowledge in bringing others to share His
grace."—The Desire of Ages, page 190.
   12. At this time, who arrived at the well? How were they af-
fected? What did they not do? John 4:27.
   13. What did the woman then do? What message did she bear? .
What was the response? John 4:28-30.
    NorE.—"The woman had been filled with joy as she listened to Christ's
words. The wonderful revelation was almost overpowering. Leaving her
waterpot, she returned to the city, to carry the message to others. Jesus knew
why she had gone. Leaving her waterpot spoke unmistakably as to the effect
of His words. It was the earnest desire of her soul to obtain the living water;
and she forgot her errand to the well, she forgot the Saviour's thirst, which she
had purposed to supply. With heart overflowing with gladness, she hastened
on her way, to impart to others the precious light she had received."—The
Desire of Ages, page 191.
   14. What was the immediate result of the Saviour's first visit to
Samaria? What urgent request did the Samaritans make, and what
was His response? What was the reason for their faith? John
4:39-42.
    NOTE.—"Christ, in opening to the minds of the Samaritans the word of life,
sowed many seeds of truth, and showed the people how they, too, could sow
seeds of truth in the minds of others. How much good might be accomplished
if all who know the truth would labor for sinners,—for those who need so
much to know and understand Bible truth, and who would respond to it as
readily as the Samaritans responded to the words of Christ ! How little do we
enter into sympathy with God on the point that should be the strongest bond
of union between us and Him,—compassion for depraved, guilty, suffering
souls, dead in trespasses and sins !"—Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 31.

    MEMORY VERSE: "The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He bath
anointed Me to preach the gospel to the poor; He hath sent Me to heal the broken-
hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to
set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord."
Luke 4:18, 19.
    STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pages 192-195.

                      Sowing and Reaping
    1. Having provided food for Jesus, what did the disciples entreat
Him to do? What was His reply? How did the disciples express
their perplexity? John 4:31-33.
    2. How did Jesus set forth the great principle that ever guided
Him in His life on earth as our example? John 4:34; Ps. 40:8.
   NoTE.—"However trying their labor, the true workers do not regard it as
drudgery. They are ready to spend and to be spent; but it is a cheerful work,
done with a glad heart. . . . Working with unselfish heart, ennobled by
being partakers of Christ's sufferings, sharing His sympathies, and co-operating
with Him in His labor, they help to swell the tide of His joy, and bring honor
and praise to His exalted name."—Christ's Object Lessons, pages 402, 403.
  3. To what did Jesus compare the world? What is its condition?
What duty is thus placed upon every child of God? John 4:35-38.
    NoTE.—"Those who receive are to impart to others. From every direction
are coming calls for help. God calls upon men to minister gladly to their
fellow men. Immortal crowns are to be won ; the kingdom of heaven is to be
gained; the world, perishing in ignorance, is to be enlightened. . . .
    "The work which the disciples did, we also are to do. Every Christian is to
be a missionary. In sympathy and compassion we are to minister to those in
need of help, seeking with unselfish earnestness to lighten the woes of suffering
humanity."—The Ministry of Healing, pages 103, 104.

                 Healing the Nobleman's Son
   4. From Samaria where did Jesus go? How was He received,
and why? John 4:43-45.
   5. What city did Jesus visit? Who met Him there? What urgent
request did He make, and why so urgent? John 4:46, 47.
   6. What did Jesus perceive concerning the mental attitude of the
nobleman? John 4:48, 49.
    NOTE.—"Like a flash of light, the Saviour's words to the nobleman laid bare
his heart. He saw that his motives in seeking Jesus were selfish. His vacillating
faith appeared to him in its true character. In deep distress he realized that
his doubt might cost the life of his son. He knew that he was in the presence
of One who could read the thoughts, and to whom all things were possible.
                                         [ 12 ]
In an agony of supplication he cried, 'Sir, come down ere my child die' His
faith took hold upon Christ as did Jacob, when, wrestling with the Angel, he
cried, 'I will not let Thee go, except Thou bless me.' "—The Desire of Ages,
page 198.
   7. What answer did Jesus then give to the nobleman's urgent
appeal? What act of the nobleman gave expression to his faith?
John 4:50.
   NOTE.—"Like Jacob he prevailed. The Saviour cannot withdraw from the
soul that clings to Him, pleading its great need. 'Go thy way,' He said; 'thy
son liveth.' The nobleman left the Saviour's presence with a peace and joy he
had never known before. Not only did he believe that his son would be re-
stored, but with strong confidence he trusted in Christ as the Redeemer."—
The Desire of Ages, page 198.
   8. On his return home what experience came to him? Who
besides himself believed? John 4:51-53.
 • 9. What other miracle had been wrought in Galilee? John
4:46, 54.
                       Jesus at Nazareth
  10. How was Jesus generally received in Galilee? Luke 4:14, 15.
  11. When Jesus returned to the house of His childhood and
youth, what did He do? What was His custom? Luke 4:16.
   NorE.—"During His childhood and youth, Jesus had worshiped among
His brethren in the synagogue at Nazareth. Since the opening of His ministry
He had been absent from them, but they had not been ignorant of what had
befallen Him. As He again appeared among them, their interest and expecta-
tion were excited to the highest pitch. Here were the familiar forms and
faces of those whom He had known from infancy. Here were His mother, His
brothers and sisters, and all eyes were turned upon Him as He entered the
synagogue upon the Sabbath day, and took His place among the worshipers."—
The Desire of Ages, page 236.
  12. What was delivered to Jesus? What prophecy did He read?
How were all in the synagogue affected by His gracious words?
What did they say later? Luke 4:17-22.
  13. In what words did Jesus reveal the secret thoughts of His
hearers? Luke 4:23, 24.
  14. By what experiences of Elijah and Elisha did He illustrate
God's willingness to save all men of all nations? Luke 4:25-27. See
1 Kings 17:8-16; 2 Kings 5:1-14.
   NorE.—"Our standing before God depends, not upon the amount of light
we have received, but upon the use we make of what we have. Thus even the
heathen who choose the right as far as they can distinguish it are in a more
favorable condition than are those who have had great light, and profess to
serve God, but who disregard the light, and by their daily life contradict their
profession."—The Desire of Ages, page 239.
  15. What effect did these words have upon the people? What
did they purpose to do? Luke 4:28, 29.
  16. How did He escape from the enraged people? Luke 4:30.
                                     113]
    NOTE.—"When Jesus referred to the blessings given to the Gentiles, the
fierce national pride of His hearers was aroused, and His words were drowned
in a tumult of voices. These people had prided themselves on keeping the
law; but now that their prejudices were offended, they were ready to com-
mit murder. The assembly broke up, and laying hands upon Jesus, they thrust
Him from the synagogue, and out of the city. All seemed eager for His de-
struction. They hurried Him to the brow of a precipice, intending to cast
Him down headlong. Shouts and maledictions filled the air. Some were cast-
ing stones at Him, when suddenly He disappeared from among them. The
heavenly messengers who had been by His side in the synagogue were with
Him in the midst of that maddened throng. They shut Him in from His
enemies, and conducted Him to a place of safety."—The Desire of Ages, page
240.

    1. How did the people express their earnest desire to hear the
word of God from the lips of Jesus? Where was He standing?
Luke 5:1.
    2. What did Jesus do to secure a point of vantage from which
to teach the people? Luke 5:2, 3.
    NOTE.—"In the words spoken to those gathered about Him, He [Christ]
was speaking also to these other souls the very words that would come to
them as a message of hope in trial, of comfort in sorrow, and heavenly light
in darkness. Through the Holy Spirit, that voice which was speaking from
the fisherman's boat on the Sea of Galilee would be heard speaking peace to
human hearts to the close of time."—The Desire of Ages, page 245.
     3. Having ended His discourse, what did Jesus say to Simon?
Luke 5:4.
     4. What reply did Simon make? What was the result of his
prompt obedience? Luke 5:5-7.
                          The Call to Life Service
    5. What effect did this wonderful manifestation of divine power
have upon Peter? What did he do and say? Who shared Peter's
feelings? Luke 5:8-10 (first part of verse 10).
   NOTE.—"But Peter was unmindful now of boats or lading. This miracle,
above any other he had ever witnessed, was to him a manifestation of divine
power. In Jesus he saw One who held all nature under His control. The
presence of divinity revealed His own unholiness. Love for his Master, shame
                                        [ 14 ]
for his own unbelief, gratitude for the condescension of Christ, above all, the
sense of his uncleanness in the presence of infinite purity, overwhelmed him."
 —The Desire of Ages, page 246.
      6. What encouraging word did Jesus speak to Peter? From
henceforth what was to be the work of Peter, James, John, and
Andrew? How did they respond to His call? Luke 5:10, list part,
11; Mark 1:16-18.
     NOTE.—"Until this time none of the disciple; had fully united as colaborers
 with Jesus. They had witnessed many of His miracles, and had listened to His
teaching; but they had not entirely forsaken their former employment"—
 The Desire of Ages, page 246.
      7. What power for witnessing will God give to His church?
Matt. 28:18-20; Mark 16:20.
     NOTE.—"God takes men as they are, and educates them for His service,
 if they, will yield themselves to Him. The Spirit of God, received into the soul,
 will quicken all its faculties. Under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, the mind
 that is devoted unreservedly to God develops harmoniously, and is strength-
 ened to comprehend and fulfill the requirements of God. . . . He who longs
 to be of service to Christ is so quickened by the life-giving power of the Sun
 of Righteousness that he is enabled to bear much fruit to the glory of God."
 —The Desire of Ages, page 251.
                              At Capernaum
    8. In what city did Jesus make His temporary abiding place?
How does inspiration speak of it? Matt. 4:13-16; 9:1.
   NOTE.—"At Capernaum Jesus dwelt in the intervals of His journeys to and
fro, and it came to be known as 'His own city.' It was on the shores of the
Sea of Galilee, and near the borders of the beautiful plain of Gennesaret, if not
actually upon it."—The Desire of Ages, page 252.
   "In Capernaum the nobleman's son whom Christ had healed was a witness
to His power. And the court official and his household joyfully testified of
their faith. When it was known that the Teacher Himself was among them,
the whole city was aroused. Multitudes flocked to His presence. On the Sab-
bath the people crowded the synagogue until great numbers had to turn away,
unable to find entrance."—/bid., page 253.
                    A Great Deliverance Wrought
      9. While Jesus was preaching in the synagogue, who inter-
 rupted Him? What words were employed by this wretched sufferer?
 Luke 4:33, 34.
     NorE.—"The mind of this wretched sufferer had been darkened by Satan,
 but in the Saviour's presence a ray of light had pierced the gloom. He was
 roused to long for freedom from Satan's control; but the demon resisted the
 power of Christ. When the man tried to appeal to Jesus for help, the evil
 spirit put words into his mouth, and he cried out in an agony of fear. The
 demoniac partially comprehended that he was in the presence of One who
 could set him free; but when he tried to come within reach of that mighty
 hand, another's will held him, another's words found utterance through him.
 The conflict between the power of Satan and his own desire for freedom was
 terrible."—The Desire of Ages, pages 255, 256.
                                       I 16 3
  10. In what words did Jesus rebuke the evil spirit? What fol-
lowed His command? Luke 4:35.
    NorE.—"The Saviour spoke with authority and set the captive free. The
man who had been possessed stood before the wondering people in the free-
dom of self-possession.
    "With glad voice he praised God for deliverance. The eye that had so
lately glared with the fire of insanity now beamed with intelligence, and
overflowed with grateful tears. The people were dumb with amazement."—
The Ministry of Healing, page 92.
  11. What effect did this evidence of Christ's power over evil
spirits have upon the people? Luke 4:36, 37.
    NOTE.—"The man who had been possessed stood before the wondering
people happy in the freedom of self-possession. Even the demon had testified
to the divine power of the Saviour. . . .
    "The secret cause of the affliction that had made this man a fearful spec-
tacle to his friends and a burden to himself was in his own life. He had been
fascinated by the pleasures of sin, and had thought to make life a grand car-
nival. He did not dream of becoming a terror to the world and the reproach
of his family. He thought his time could be spent in innocent folly. But once
in the downward path, his feet rapidly descended. Intemperance and frivolity
perverted the noble attributes of his nature, and Satan took absolute control
of him."—The Desire of Ages, page 256.

                    When the Sun Was Set
  3. At the close of the Sabbath what miracles were wrought?
How was the city affected? Luke 4:40, 41; Mark 1:32-34.
   NoTE.—"Tidings of the work of Christ spread rapidly throughout Caper-
naum. For fear of the rabbis, the people dared not come for healing upon the
Sabbath; but no sooner had the sun disappeared below the horizon than there
was a great commotion. From the homes, the shops, the market places, the
inhabitants of the city pressed toward the humble dwelling that sheltered
Jesus. The sick were brought upon couches, they came leaning upon staffs, or,
supported by friends, they tottered feebly into the Saviour's presence.
                                     16
   "Hour after hour they came and went; for none could know whether
tomorrow would find the Healer still among them. Never before had Caper-
naum witnessed a day like this. The air was filled with the voice of triumph
and shouts of deliverance.. .
   "Not until the last sufferer had been relieved did Jesus cease His work. It
was far into the night when the multitude departed, and silence settled down
upon the home of Simon."—The Desire of Ages, pages 259, 260.
   4. What did even the devils know? Luke 4:41.
   5. What testimony is given regarding Christ's power over the
multitudes? Luke 4:15, 22, 32; John 7:46.
   NOTE.—"His tender compassion fell with a touch of healing upon weary
and troubled hearts. Even amid the turbulence of angry enemies He was
surrounded with an atmosphere of peace. The beauty of His countenance,
the loveliness of His character, above all, the love expressed in look and
tone, drew to Him all who were not hardened in unbelief. Had it not been
for the sweet, sympathetic spirit that shone out in every look and word, He
would not have attracted the large congregations that He did. The afflicted
ones who came to Him felt that He linked His interest with theirs as a faithful
and tender friend, and they desired to know more of the truths He taught.
Heaven was brought near. They longed to abide in His presence, that the com-
fort of His love might be with them continually."—The Desire of Ages, page
254.
    6. Early the next morning what did Jesus do? What did His
disciples do? What did they tell Jesus? Mark 1:35-37.
    NOTE.—"No other life was ever so crowded with labor and responsibility
as was that of Jesus; yet how often He was found in prayer! How constant
was His communion with God 1 . . . In a life wholly devoted to the good of
others, the Saviour found it necessary to withdraw from the thoroughfares of
travel and from the throng that followed Him day after day. He must turn
aside from a life of ceaseless activity and contact with human needs, to seek
retirement and unbroken communion with His Father. As one with us, a sharer
in our needs and weaknesses, He was wholly dependent upon God, and in the
secret place of prayer He sought divine strength, that He might go forth braced
for duty and trial."—The Desire of Ages, pages 362, 363.
   7. What did Jesus say the disciples should do? How did He
continue His work? Mark 1:38, 39; Luke 4:43, 44.
   8. What was the message that Jesus preached in Galilee? What
did Paul say concerning the time of Christ's first advent? Mark
1:14, 15; Gal. 4:4, 5.
   9. Upon what prophetic period was Christ's message based?
Dan. 9:24, 25.
    NOTE.—"The burden of Christ's preaching was, 'The time is fulfilled, and
the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.' Thus the
gospel message, as given by the Saviour Himself, was based on the prophecies.
The 'time' which He declared to be fulfilled was the period made known by the
angel Gabriel to Daniel. . . . The commandment to restore and build Jeru-
salem, as completed by the decree of Artaxerxes Longimanus, went into effect
in the autumn of B. c. 457. From this time four hundred and eighty-three
years extend to the autumn of A. D. 27. According to the prophecy, this period
                                     t17 1
was to reach to the Messiah, the Anointed One. In A. D. 27, Jesus at His bap-
tism received the anointing of the Holy Spirit, and, soon afterward began His
 ministry. Then the message was proclaimed, 'The time is fulfilled.' "—The
 Desire of Ages, pages 232, 233.
                               Healing the Leper
    10. While Jesus was preaching and healing in Galilee, who came
 to Him? What degree of earnestness and faith did the afflicted man
 show? Mark 1:39, 40.
     11. How did Jesus honor his faith? Mark 1:41.
     12. How soon was the man cleansed from this foul disease? Mark
1:42.
      NorE.—"He [the leper] is a loathsome spectacle. The disease has made
 frightful inroads, and his decaying body is horrible to look upon. At sight of
 him the people fall back in-terror. They crowd upon one another in their
 eagerness to escape from contact with him. Some try to prevent him from ap-
 proaching Jesus, but in vain. He neither sees nor hears them. Their expres-
 sions of loathing are lost upon him. He sees only the Son of God. He hears
 only the voice that speaks life to the dying. Pressing to Jesus, he casts himself
 at His feet with the cry, 'Lord, if Thou wilt, Thou canst make sae clean'
     "Jesus replied, 'I will; be thou made clean,' and laid His hand upon him.
      "Immediately a change passed over the leper. His flesh became healthy,
:the nerves sensitive, the muscles firm. The 'rough, scaly surface peculiar to
 leprosy disappeared, and a soft glow, like that upon the skin of a healthy
  child, took its place."—The Desire of Ages, page 263.
     13. What charge did Jesus give to the man whom He had healed?
  What law of the Jews did Jesus recognize? Mark 1:43, 44; Lev.
  14:1-32.
     14. What was the result of the leper's not heeding the first part
  of the counsel given him? Mark 1:45.
      NoTE.—"The work of Christ in cleansing the leper from his terrible dis-
  ease is an illustration of His work in cleansing the soul from sin. . . . But in
  laying His hand upon the leper, Jesus received no defilement. His touch
  imparted life-giving power. The leprosy was cleansed. Thus it is with the
  leprosy of sin,—deep-rooted, deadly, and impossible to be cleansed by-human
  power. . . . In the case of leprosy, no sooner was the appeal made than it
  was granted. When we pray for earthly blessings, the answer to our prayer
  may be delayed, or God may give us something other than we ask, but not so
  when we ask for deliverance from sin. It is His will to cleanse us from sin,
  to make us His children, and to enable us to live a holy life."—The Desire of
  Ages, page 266.

     LESSON SCRIPTURES: Luke 5:17-32; Mark 2:1-17; Matt. 9:1-9.
     MEMORY VERSE: "For whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or
 to say, Arise, and walk? But 'that ye may know that the Son of man bath power on
 earth to forgive sins, (then saith He to the sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up thy
 bed, and go unto thine house." Matt. 9:5, 6.

                    Hearing the Paralytic
  1. On the return of Jesus to Capernaum, how was He received?
Mark 2:1, 2.
  2. On a certain day, while Jesus was teaching, who are especially
mentioned as present? From whence did they come? Luke 5:17.
    NorE.—The Pharisees and doctors of the law bore the title of "rabbis."
"They were the theologians, the jurists, the legislators, the politicians, and,
indeed, the soul of Israel. The priests had sunk to a subordinate place in the
public regard."—Cunningham Geikie, Life and Words of Christ, 1897 ed., vol.
2, p. 19.
    3. Who was brought to Jesus for healing? How was he brought?
Mark 2:3.
    4. When attempting to approach the Saviour, what serious
difficulty confronted them? How was it overcome? Mark 2:4;
Luke 5:18, 19.
   NOTE.—"It was not physical restoration he desired so much as relief from
the burden of sin. If he could see Jesus, and receive the assurance of forgiveness
and peace with Heaven, he would be content to live or die, according to God's
will. The cry of the dying man was, Oh that I might come into His presence!
There was no time to lose; already his wasted flesh was showing signs of
decay."—The Desire of Ages, page 267.
                  The Peace of Forgiveness
   5. When  Jesus saw   their faith, what did He say to the palsied
man? Mark 2:5.
  NOTE.—"In simple faith he accepted the words of Jesus as the boon of
new life. He urged no further request, but lay in blissful silence, too happy
for words. The light of heaven irradiated his countenance, and the people
looked with awe upon the scene."—The Desire of Ages, page 268.
    6. Hearing the words of Jesus, how did some of the dignitaries
silently reason? Luke 5:21; Mark 2:6, 7.
   NoTE.—"These had come as spies, seeking an accusation against Jesus."—
The Desire of Ages, page 268.
    7. What did Jesus perceive? What question did He ask? Mark
2:8, 9.
                      Power to Forgive Sin
    8. How did Jesus make clear to all present that He had power
on earth to forgive sins? Mark 2:10, 11.
    9. How complete was the man's restoration? What effect did
this manifestation of divine power have upon that great assembly?
Mark 2:12; Luke 5:25.
    Nora.—"Then he who had been borne on a litter to Jesus rises to his feet
 with the elasticity and strength of youth. The life-giving blood bounds
 through his veins. Every organ of his body springs into sudden activity. The
 glow of health succeeds the pallor of approaching death."—The Desire of Ages,
 page 269.
                                       [ 19 ]
  10. How did this experience verify the testimony of the apostle
Paul regarding the gospel of Christ? Rom. 1:16.
    NOTE.—"In the home of the healed paralytic there was great rejoicing
when he returned to his family, carrying with ease the couch upon which he
had been slowly borne from their presence but a short time before. They gath-
ered round with tears of joy, scarcely daring to believe their eyes. . . . An
expression of purity and peace had taken the place of the marks of sin and
suffering. Glad thanksgiving went up from that home, and God was glorified
through His Son, who had restored hope to the hopeless, and strength to the
stricken one. This man and his family were ready to lay down their lives for
Jesus. No doubt dimmed their faith, no unbelief marred their fealty to Him
who had brought light into their darkened home."—The Desire of Ages,
page 271.
  11. As Jesus went out by the seaside, what did the multitude
continue to do? Mark 2:13.
                     Levi-Matthew Called
  12. As Jesus passed by from thence, whom did He see sitting at a
tax booth? What did Jesus say to him? What did the tax collector
do? Mark 2:14.
    NoTE.—"Of the Roman officials in Palestine, none were more hated than the
publicans. The fact that the taxes were imposed by a foreign power was a
continual irritation to the Jews, being a reminder that their independence had
departed. And the taxgatherers were not merely the instruments of Roman
oppression; they were extortioners on their own account, enriching them-
selves at the expense of the people. A Jew who accepted this office at the
hands of the Romans was looked upon as betraying the honor of his nation.
He was despised as an apostate, and was classed with the vilest of society.
    "To this class belonged Levi-Matthew. . . . Matthew had listened to the
Saviour's teaching. As the convicting Spirit of God revealed his sinfulness,
he longed to seek help from Christ ; but he was accustomed to the exclusiveness
of the rabbis, and had no thought that this Great Teacher would notice him."
—The Desire of Ages, page 272.
  13. Having accepted the call, how did Matthew honor Jesus?
Luke 5:29; Mark 2:15.
    NoTE.—"Among the publicans a widespread interest was created. Their
hearts were drawn toward the divine Teacher. In the joy of his new disciple-
ship, Matthew longed to bring his former associates to Jesus. Accordingly
he made a feast at his own house, and called together his relatives and-friends.
Not only were publicans included, but many others who were of doubtful
reputation, and were proscribed by their more scrupulous neighbors. . . .
    "Jesus sat as an honored guest,at the table of the publicans, by His sym-
pathy and social kindliness showing that He recognized the dignity of human-
ity; and men longed to become worthy of His confidence. Upon their thirsty
hearts His words fell with blessed, life-giving power. New impulses were
awakened, and the possibility of a new life opened to these outcasts of society."
—The Desire of Ages, pages 273, 274.
  14. What complaint was made against Christ and His disciples?
By whom was it made? What reply did Jesus make? Luke 5:30-32;
Mark 2:16, 17.
                                     [ 20]
    NOTE.—"At such gatherings as this, not a few were impressed by the
Saviour's teaching who did not acknowledge Him until after His ascension.
When the Holy Spirit was poured out, and three thousand were converted in
a day, there were among them many who first heard the truth at the table
of the publicans, and some of these became messengers of the gospel. To
Matthew himself the example of Jesus at the feast was a constant lesson. The
despised publican became one of the most devoted evangelists, in his own
ministry following closely in his Master's steps."—The Desire of Ages, page 274.

   LESSON HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pages 276-280, 201-206.
   MEMORY VERSE: "Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.
And immediately the Man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on
the same day was the Sabbath." John 5:8,9.
   LESSON HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pages 276-280, 201-206.

                                   Fasting
  1. What question did the disciples of John the Baptist ask Jesus?
What was His reply? Matt. 9:14; Luke 5:33, 34.
     2. What did Jesus say about the time when it would be appro-
priate for His disciples to fast? Luke 5:35.
    NOTE.—"It was a bright picture which the words of Christ had called up,
but across it lay a heavy shadow, which His eye alone discerned. 'The days
will come,' He said, 'when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them,
and then shall they fast in those days.' When they should see their Lord
betrayed and crucified, the disciples would mourn and fast. In His last words
to them in the upper chamber, He said, 'A little while, and ye shall not see
Me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see Me. Verily, verily, I say unto
you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall
be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.'"—The Desire of Ages,
page 277.
     3. By what parables did Jesus endeavor to win His hearers from
the traditions and superstitions of the Pharisees to His teachings
and those of John? Luke 5:36-38.
    NOTE.—"The faith that works by love and purifies the soul could find no
place for union with the religion of the Pharisees, made up of ceremonies and
the injunctions of men. The effort to unite the teachings of Jesus with the
established religion would be vain. The vital truth of God, like fermenting
wine, would burst the old, decaying bottles of the Pharisaical tradition."—
The Desire of Ages, page 279.
     4. By what symbols are the teachings of Christ and of the Phari-
sees contrasted? Luke 5:39.
    NOTE.—"The teaching of Christ, though it was represented by the new
wine, was not a new doctrine, but the revelation of that which had been
taught from the beginning. But to the Pharisees the truth of God had lost its
                                     [ 21 ]
original significance and beauty. To them Christ's teaching was new in almost
every respect, and it was unrecognized and unacknowledged."—The Desire of
Ages, page 279.
                          At the Pool of Bethesda
     5. What occasion caused Jesus again to visit Jerusalem? John
5:1.
     6. What noted pool was in Jerusalem? Who were attracted to
it? For what purpose did they come? John 5:2, 3.
     7. What was commonly believed concerning the water in the
pool? John 5:4.
    NOTE.—"At certain seasons the waters of this pool were agitated, and it
was commonly believed that this was the result of supernatural power, and
that whoever first after the troubling of the pool stepped into the waters, would
be healed of whatever disease he had."—The Desire of Ages, page 201.
     8. What afflicted person at the pool attracted the attention of
Jesus? How long had he been afflicted? What question did Jesus
ask him? John 5:5, 6.
    NOTE.—"Jesus was again at Jerusalem. Walking alone, in apparent medi-
tation and prayer, He came to the pool. He saw the wretched sufferers watch-
ing for that which they supposed to be their only chance of cure. He longed
to exercise His healing power, and make every sufferer whole.. . .
    "But the Saviour saw one case of supreme wretchedness. It was that of a
man who had been a helpless cripple for thirty-eight years. His disease was in
a great degree the result of his own sin, and was looked upon as a judgment
from God. Alone and friendless, feeling that he was shut out from God's mercy,
the sufferer had passed long years of misery."—The Desire of Ages, pages
201, 202.
     9. How did this poor sufferer answer Jesus? John 5:7.
                           A Wonderful Miracle
   10. With what words of tendei compassion did Jesus reply?
What immediately followed? John 5:8, 9, first part.
    NOTE.—"Jesus does not ask this sufferer to exercise faith in Him. He simply
says, 'Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.' But the man's faith takes hold upon
that word. Every nerve and muscle thrills with new life, and healthful action
comes to his crippled limbs. Without question he sets his will to obey the
command of Christ, and all his muscles respond to his will. Springing to his
feet, he finds himself an active man."—The Desire of Ages, page 202.
   11. On what day of the week did this occur? What criticism did
the Jews at once make? John 5:9, last part, 10.
    NOTE.—"The restored paralytic stooped to take up his bed, which was only
a rug and a blanket, and as he straightened himself again with a sense of delight,
he looked around for his Deliverer; but Jesus was lost in the crowd. The man
feared that he would not know Him if he should see Him again. As he hurried
on his way with firm, free step, praising God and rejoicing in his new-found
strength, he met several of the Pharisees, and immediately told them of his
cure. He was surprised at the coldness with which they listened to his story."
—The Desire of Ages, page 203.
                                      [22]
  12. What further conversation did the Jews have with the man
who had been healed? Why could he not point out the Healer?
John 5:11-13.
                    Magnifying the Law
  13. Where did Jesus find the man He had healed? What timely
warning did He give him? John 5:14.
   NOTE.—"In the temple Jesus met the man who had been healed. He had
come to bring a sin offering and also a thank offering for the great mercy he
had received. Finding him among the worshipers, Jesus made Himself known."
—The Desire of Ages, page 204.
  14. How did the healed man unintentionally work against Jesus?
What did the Jews do? To what lengths did their fanatical hatred
lead them, and why? John 5:15, 16.
   15. What was one purpose for Christ's coming to the earth?
Isa. 42:21.
   NoTE.—"He had come to free the Sabbath from those burdensome require-
ments that had made it a curse instead of a blessing.
   "For this reason He had chosen the Sabbath upon which to perform the
act of healing at Bethesda. He could have healed the sick as well on any
other day of the week; or He might simply have cured him, without bidding
him bear away his bed. But this would not have given Him the opportunity
He desired. A wise purpose underlay every act of Christ's life on earth. Every-
thing He did was important in itself and in its teaching. Among the afflicted
ones at the pool He selected the worst case upon whom to exercise His healing
power, and bade the man carry his bed through the city in order to publish
the great work that had been wrought upon him. Tnis would raise the ques-
tion of what it was lawful to do on the Sabbath, and would open the way for
Him to denounce the restrictions of the Jews in regard to the Lord's day, and
to declare their traditions void."—The Desire of Ages, page 206.

pp. 249-253.
                          The Sabbath
    1. Where were Jesus and His disciples walking on a certain
Sabbath? What did the disciples do? Mark 2:23; Luke 6:1.
    2. What complaint was brought to Jesus by certain of the Phari-
sees? By divine law, what freedom was accorded to all? Mark 2:24;
Deut. 23:24, 25.
                                     [ 23 ]
     NOTE.—"On any other day this act would have excited no comment, for
 one passing through a field of grain, an orchard, or a vineyard, was at liberty
 to gather what he desired to eat. But to do this on the Sabbath was held to
 be an act of desecration. Not only was the gathering of the grain a kind of
 reaping, but the rubbing of it in the hands was a kind of thresing. Thus, in
 the opinion of the rabbis, there was a double offense."—The Desire of Ages,
 page 284.
      3. What examples did Jesus cite in defense of the disciples?
What implied rebuke for their ignorance of the Scriptures did His
answer to these Jewish teachers contain? Mark 2:25, 26; Matt.
12:5-7.
     NOTE.—"Iflt was right for David to satisfy his hunger by eating of the
 bread that had been set apart to a holy use, then it was right for the disciples
to supply their need by plucking the grain upon the sacred hours of the Sab-
bath. Again, the priests in the temple performed greater labor on the Sabbath
than upon other days. The same labor in secular business would be sinful; but
the work of the priests was in the service of God. They were performing those
rites that pointed to the redeeming power of Christ, and their labor was in
harmony with the object of the Sabbath. But now Christ Himself had come.
The disciples, in doing the work of Christ, were engaged in God's service, and
that which was necessary for the accomplishment of this work it was right
to do on the Sabbath day."—The Desire of Ages, page 285.
      4. What did Jesus say as to the origin and object of the Sabbath?
Mark 2:27, 28.
     NOTE.—"Christ would teach His disciples and His enemies that the service
of God is first of all. The object of God's work in this world is the redemption
of man; therefore that which is necessary to be done on the Sabbath in the
accomplishment of this work is in accord with the Sabbath law. Jesus then
crowned His argument by declaring Himself the 'Lord of the Sabbath,'—One
above all question and above all law. This infinite Judge acquits the disciples
of blame, appealing to the very statutes they are accused of violating."—The
Desire of Ages, page 285.
      5. What is the Sabbath designed to be to every true child of
God? Ezek. 20:12.
     NOTE.—"Great blessings are enfolded in the observance of the Sabbath, and
God desires that the Sabbath day shall be to us a day of joy. . . . Though sin
has entered the world to mar His perfect work, God still gives to us the Sab-
bath as a witness that One omnipotent, infinite in goodness and mercy, created
all things. Our heavenly Father desires through the observance of the Sabbath
to preserve among men a knowledge of Himself. He desires that the Sabbath
shall direct our minds to Him as the true and living God, and that through
knowing Him we may have life and peace."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 349.
                 The Withered Hand Restored
    6. When Jesus entered a synagogue on another Sabbath, what
afflicted man did He observe? Who were watching Him, and for
what purpose? Luke 6:6, 7.
       7. What did Jesus know? What did He say to the man? Luke
6:8.
                                     [ 24 ]
    8. What question did the spies ask Jesus? What convincing
reply did He make? Matt. 12:10; Luke 6:9.
    9. By what common practice among the Jews did Jesus illustrate
the spirit that prompted His accusers? Matt. 12:11, 12.
             The Pharisees Seek to Destroy Jesus
  10. How did the attitude of the Pharisees affect Jesus? What did
He say to the afflicted man, and what was the result? Mark 3:5.
  11. What effect did the working of this miracle have upon the
Pharisees? What did they do? Luke 6:11; Mark 3:6.
  NOTE.—"In the healing of the withered hand, Jesus condemned the cus-
tom of the Jews, and left the fourth commandment standing as God had given
it. 'It is lawful to do well on the Sabbath days,' He declared. By sweeping
away the senseless restrictions of the Jews, Christ honored the Sabbath, while
those who complained of Him were dishonoring God's holy day."—The Desire
of Ages, page 287.
   12. How did Jesus thwart the purpose of His enemies to destroy
Him? Whence came the great multitude that thronged Him? Mark
3:7-9.
   13. What work of reform such as Jesus wrought is now due?
Isa. 58:12, 13.
   NOTE.—"To all who receive the Sabbath as a sign of Christ's creative and
redeeming power, it will be a delight. Seeing Christ in it, they delight them-
selves in Him. The Sabbath points them to the work of creation as an evidence
of His mighty power in redemption. While it calls to mind the lost peace of
Eden, it tells of peace restored through the Saviour. And every object in
nature repeats His invitation, 'Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy-
laden, and I will give you rest.'"—The Desire of Ages, page 289.
   14. What promise is given to all who with heart and soul engage
in this work? Isa. 58:14.
   NOTE.—"To us as to Israel the Sabbath is given 'for a perpetual covenant.'
To those who reverence His holy day the Sabbath is a sign that God recognizes
them as His chosen people. It is a pledge that He will fulfill to them His
covenant. Every soul who accepts the sign of God's government places him-
self under the divine, everlasting covenant. He fastens himself to the golden
chain of obedience, every link of which is a promise. . . .
    "The Sabbath is a golden clasp that unites God and His people... . God
has called us to uplift the standard of His downtrodden Sabbath. How im-
portant, then, that our example in Sabbathkeeping should be right."—Testi-
monies, vol. 6, pp. 350-353.
              The Sick Healed, Devils Cast Out
  15. What did Jesus do for the multitude? What did the unclean
spirits acknowledge? What did He charge them not to do? Mark
3:10-12.
  16. What prophecy was fulfilled in this experience of Jesus?
Matt. 12:17-21; Isa. 42:1-4.

Mount of Blessing," pages 9-16.
                         Choosing His Witnesses
     1. Where did Jesus go to prepare for the ordination of the dis-
ciples? Mark 3:13.
     2. How had He spent the preceding night? Luke 6:12.
    NorE.—"The Saviour knew the character of the men whom He had chosen;
all their weaknesses and errors were open before Him; He knew the perils
through which they must pass, the responsibility that would rest upon them;
and His heart yearned over these chosen ones. Alone upon a mountain near
the Sea of Galilee He spent the entire night in prayer for them, while they
were sleeping at the foot of the mountain. With the first light of dawn He
summoned them to meet Him; for He had something of importance to com-
municate to them."—The Desire of Ages, page 291.
     3. What important work did Jesus perform in behalf of His
church on the day following that night of communion with His
Father? Luke 6:13.
    NorE.—"Jesus had called His disciples that He might send them forth as
His witnesses, to declare to the world what they had seen and heard of Him.
Their office was the most important to which human beings had ever been
called, and was second only to that of Christ Himself. They were to be workers
together with God for the saving of the world. As in the Old Testament the
twelve patriarchs stand as representatives of Israel, so the twelve apostles were
to stand as representatives of the gospel church."—The Desire of Ages, page
291.
  "With words of prayer and instruction, [Jesus] laid His hands upon their
heads in benediction, setting them apart to the gospel work."—Thoughts
From the Mount of Blessing, page 15.

He called? Mark 3:14.

Jesus to the world. With almost impatient eagerness the angels wait for our
co-operation ; for man must be the channel to communicate with man. And
when we give ourselves to Christ in wholehearted devotion, angels rejoice that
they may speak through our voices to reveal God's love."—The Desire of Ages,

                         The Beatitudes
   1. In the early morning following the ordination of the apostles,
who on the shores of Gennesaret awaited the coming of the great
Teacher? Matt. 4:25; Luke 6:17-19.
   NOTE.—"The Sermon on the Mount, though given especially to the dis-
ciples, was spoken in the hearing of the multitude. After the ordination of the
apostles, Jesus went with them to the seaside. Here in the early morning the
people had begun to assemble. Besides the usual crowds from the Galilean
towns, there were people from Judea, and even from Jerusalem itself ; from
Perea, from Decapolis, from Idumea, away to the south of Judea; and from
Tyre and Sidon, the Phoenician cities on the shore of the Mediterranean.
`When they had heard what great things He did,' they 'came to hear Him,
and to be healed of their diseases: . . . there went virtue out of Him, and
healed them all"'—The Desire of Ages, page 298.
                                     [ 27 ]
      2. To what place did Jesus lead the vast assembly? Matt. 5:1.
     NOTE.—"The narrow beach did not afford even standing room within reach
 of His voice for all who desired to hear Him, and Jesus led the way back to
 the mountainside. Reaching a level space that offered a pleasant gathering
 place for the vast assembly, He seated Himself on the grass, and the disciples
 and the multitude followed His example.
     "The disciples' place was always next to Jesus. The people constantly
 pressed upon Him, yet the disciples understood that they were not to be
 crowded away from His presence. They sat close beside Him, that they might
 not lose a word of His instruction. They were attentive listeners, eager to
 understand the truths they were to make known to all lands and all ages."—
 The Desire of Ages, pages 298, 299.
      3. What were the first words of Jesus in this memorable sermon?
Matt. 5:2, 3.
     NoTE.—"Christ's first words to the people on the mount were words of
blessing. Happy are they, He said, who recognize their spiritual poverty, and
feel their need of redemption. The gospel is to be preached to the poor. Not
to the spiritually proud, those who claim to be rich and in need of nothing, is it
revealed, but to those who are humble and contrite. One fountain only has
been opened for sin, a fountain for the poor in spirit."—The Desire of Ages,
pages 299, 300.
      4. What words of encouragement are given to those who
mourn? Matt. 5:4.
    NOTE.—"The mourning here brought to view is true heart sorrow for sin."
—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, page 22.
    "The worldling may pronounce this sorrow a weakness; but it is the
strength which binds the penitent to the Infinite One with links that cannot
be broken."—The Desire of Ages, page 300.
      5. What is the third beatitude? What promise is made to such?
Matt. 5:5; Ps. 37:11.
    NOTE.—" 'Blessed are the meek.' The difficulties we have to encounter
may be very much lessened by that meekness which hides itself in. Christ.
If we possess the humility of our Master, we shall rise above the slights, the
rebuffs, the annoyances, to which we are daily exposed, and they will cease
to cast a gloom over the spirit. The highest evidence of nobility in a Christian
is self-control. He who under abuse or cruelty fails to maintain a calm and
trustful spirit robs God of His right to reveal in him His own perfection of
character. Lowliness of heart is the strength that gives victory to the followers
of Christ; it is the token of their connection with the courts above."—The
Desire of Ages, page 301.
      6. What is the fourth beatitude, and the promise attending it?
Matt. 5:6.
    NOTE.—"The Holy Spirit never leaves unassisted the soul who is looking
unto Jesus. He takes of the things of Christ and shows them unto him. If the
eye is kept fixed on Christ, the work of the Spirit ceases not until the soul is
conformed to His image. The pure element of love will expand the soul, giving
it a capacity for higher attainments, for increased knowledge of heavenly
things, so that it will not rest short of the fullness."—The Desire of Ages, page
302.
      7. What is promised to the merciful? To the pure in heart?
Matt. 5:7, 8.
                                        1 283
    NOTE.—"The merciful are those who manifest compassion to the poor,
the suffering, and the oppressed."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing,
page 40.
   "Every impure thought defiles the soul, impairs the moral sense, and tends
to obliterate the impressions of the Holy Spirit. It dims the spiritual vision,
so that men cannot behold God. The Lord may and does forgive the repent-
ing sinner; but though forgiven, the soul is marred. All impurity of speech
or of thought must be shunned by him who would have clear discernment
of spiritual truth."—The Desire of Ages, page 302.
   8. What are peacemakers called? Matt. 5:9.
   9. What is promised to those who are persecuted for righteous-
ness' sake? What manner of persecution do some suffer for Jesus'
sake? Matt. 5:10, 11.
  10. What may be the experience of those who suffer for Jesus'
sake? Who have likewise suffered? Matt. 5:12.
    NorE.—"So far from causing grief, persecution should bring joy to the dis-
ciples of Christ; for it is an evidence that they are following in the steps of
their Master. . . .
   "Those who love their Redeemer will rejoice at every opportunity of shar-
ing with Him humiliation and reproach. The love they bear their Lord, makes
suffering for His sake sweet."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, page 49.
                        Salt and Light
  11. What are the recipients of these blessings said to be? Matt.
5:13.
   NoTE.—"Salt is valued for its preservative properties; and when God calls
His children salt, He would teach them that His purpose in making them the
subjects of His grace is that they may become agents in saving others."—
Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, page .59.
  12. To what else are the blessed likened? How can a light be
made to serve most effectively? Matt. 5:14, 15.
  13. What is the Christian to do? Matt. 5:16.

                 The Spirituality of the Law;
                    Its Enduring Character
    1. What did Jesus announce as to the purpose of His coming
to earth? Matt. 5:17.
                                     129 ]
   NoTE.—"The mission of Christ on earth was not to destroy the law, but
by His grace to bring man back to obedience to its precepts."—Thoughts From
the Mount of Blessing, page 77.
   2. What did. He add concerning the abiding nature of the law?
Matt. 5:18.
  NOTE.—"Easier would it be to sweep away the heaven and the earth, than
to destroy the least letter, one yod—or the least point of a letter, one projecting
horn—of that code which contains the very principles of all moral life. Jesus
warned them that He came, not to abolish that law, but to obey and to fulfill.
. . . He fulfilled that olden law by perfectly keeping it, and by imparting a
power to keep it to all who believe in Him."—F. W. Farrar, The Life of Christ,
page 260.
   3. What will be the result of failure to keep and to teach the
commandments? What righteousness does God's law require?
Matt. 5:19, 20.
  NOTE.—"That is, he shall have no place therein. For he who willfully
breaks one commandment, does not, in spirit and truth, keep any of them.
`Whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of
all.'"—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, page 81.
                       The Law Magnified
    4. What did the prophet Isaiah say regarding Christ's attitude
toward the law? Isa. 42:21.
   NOTE.—"He was to show the spiritual nature of the law, to present its far-
reaching principles, and to make plain its eternal obligation."—Thoughts
From the Mount of Blessing, page 78.
    5. How did Jesus magnify the sixth commandment? Matt.
5:21, 22.
    6. What admonition did Jesus give for the adjustment of per-
sonal differences? Matt. 5:23, 24.
    7. What further instruction is given, which, if heeded would
promote peace? Matt. 5:25, 26.
    8. How did Jesus reveal the spirituality of the seventh com-
mandment? Matt. 5:27, 28.
    9. How did Jesus illustrate the love for righteousness and hatred
for sin which would exist in our hearts? Matt. 5:29, 30.
   NOTE.—"To prevent disease from spreading to the body and destroying life,
a man would submit to part even with his right hand. Much more should he
be willing to surrender that which imperils the life of the soul."—Thoughts
From the Mount of Blessing, page 95.
  10. How did Jesus interpret the law of divorcement? Matt.
5:31, 32.
   NOTE.—"Among the Jews a man was permitted to put away his wife for
the most trivial offenses, and the woman was then at liberty to marry again.
This practice led to great wretchedness and sin. In the Sermon on the Mount
Jesus declared plainly that there could be no dissolution of the marriage tie,
except for unfaithfulness to the marriage vow."—Thoughts From the Mount
of Blessing, page 99.
                                    ( 30 1
  11. What did Jesus say about oath taking? Why should we not
swear by heaven? By the earth? By one's own head? Matt. 5:33-36.
   NOTE.—"Our Saviour did not, however, forbid the use of the judicial oath,
in which God is solemnly called to witness that what is said is truth, and
nothing but the truth. Jesus Himself, at His trial before the Sanhedrin, did
not refuse to testify under oath."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing,
page 103.
  12. What did Jesus say about the purity of our speech? Matt.
5:37.
                                 Love
  13. What instruction did Jesus give as the guiding principle in
the life of the Christian in his relation to others? Matt. 5:38-42.
    NOTE.—"Jesus bade His disciples, instead of resisting the demands of those
in authority, to do even more than was required of them. And, so far as pos-
sible, they should discharge every obligation, even if it were beyond what the
law of the land required
   "Christ does not teach us to give indiscriminately to all who ask for charity;
but He says, 'Thou shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need;' and this is to
be a gift, rather than a loan ; for we are to 'lend, hoping for nothing again.'"—
Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, pages 110-112.
   14. How is the Christian to relate himself to his enemies? Upon
whom does our heavenly Father make His sun to shine? To whom
is He kind? Matt. 5:43-47; Luke 6:35.
   NOTE.—"It is only the Spirit of God that gives love for hatred. To be
kind to the unthankful and to the evil, to do good hoping for nothing again,
is the insignia of the royalty of heaven, the sure token by which the•children
of the Highest reveal their high estate."—Thoughts From the Mount of Bless-
ing, page 115.
   15. What exalted standard did Christ set before us? Matt. 5:48.
  NOTE.—"The ideal of Christian character is Christlikeness. As the Son of
man was perfect in His life, so His followers are to be perfect in their life."—

             THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
               Southern Europe—June 29, 1946

THE  overflow of the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering this second quarter is to
 be given toward the enlargement of our work in the Southern European
Division. Already France has become a valuable base for supplying men and
means for the mission fields, but our people in that wartorn country desire fur-
ther to help finish the work of God by building a more solid base at home. To
this end and in order to strengthen our work, they most urgently need a well-
equipped sanitarium. With the exception of a few dispensaries, we have no
medical institution of any kind in France, and immediate steps should be taken
to supply this need.
    The third quarter of 1944, an overflow of $26,753.03 on the Thirteenth
Sabbath Offering was given to the mission work of the Southern European
Division. Our people in France now appeal to Sabbath school members every-
where to give liberally of their means that a medical institution may be started
in that land, which will not only serve as a training school, but will also
contribute to the diffusion of the truths of the third angel's message. Give "as
God hath prospered."
