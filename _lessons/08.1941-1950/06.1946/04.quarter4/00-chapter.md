with daily review or illustration during the week. Thus the lesson will become fixed in
the memory, a treasure never to be wholly lost."—"Education," pages 251, 252.

     THE LIFE AND TEACHINGS OF JESUS

                   Lesson 1, for October 5, 1946
             Instructing the First Evangelists
   LESSON SCRIPTURE: Matthew 10:24 to 11:1.                 •
   MEMORY VERSE: "Whosoever therefore shall confess Me before men, him will
I confess also before My Father which is in heaven. But whosoever shall deny Me
before men, him will I also deny before My Father which is in heaven." Matthew
10:32, 33.
   STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pages 349-358.

               The Disciple and His Master
1. What should be the relation between the disciple and his
master? Between the servant and his lord? Matt. 10:24, 25, first
part.
  NoTt.—"The apostles were members of the family of Jesus, and they had
accompanied Him as He traveled on foot through Galilee. They had shared
with Him the toils and hardships that overtook them. They had listened to
His discourses, they had walked and talked with the Son of God, and from
His daily instruction they had learned how to work for the elevation of hu-
manity."—The Desire of Ages, page 349.

   2. What had been said against Jesus? Since they had spoken thus
of the master of the house, what would be said of his household?
Matt. 9:34; 10:25, last part.
   Nora.—"Beelzebul, the title of a heathen deity, to whom the Jews ascribed
the sovereignty of the evil spirits."—William Smith, A Dictionary of the
Bible.

  3. If we are members of Christ's household, what are we not to
do? Why? Matt. 10:26; Heb. 4:13.

   4. Whom are we to fear? Why? Eccl. 12:13, 14.

   5. How are the words of Jesus to be proclaimed? Matt. 10:27.
                   Divine Protection Assured
  6. With what assured confidence are the children of God to move
forward in perfect obedience to their heavenly Father's will? Matt.
10:28. l
                                     f31
   NOTE.—"We should cherish love and gratitude, we should look unto Jesus
and become transformed into His image. The result of this will be increased
confidence, hope, patience, and courage. . . . Unbelieving fear will be swept
away before living faith. We shall contemplate the character of Him who
first loved us."—Testimonies to Ministers, page 226.

   7. How is our heavenly Father's unfailing care of His children
illustrated? Matt. 10:29-31.
   NOTE.—"God cares for everything and sustains everything that He has cre-
ated. He who upholds the unnumbered worlds throughout immensity, at the
same time cares for the wants of the little brown sparrow that sings its
humble song without a fear. When men go forth to their daily toil, as when
they engage in prayer; when they lie down at night, and when they rise in
the morning; when the rich man feasts in his palace, or when the poor man
gathers his children about the scanty board, each is tenderly watched by the
heavenly Father. No tears are shed that God does not notice. There is no
smile that He does not mark."—Steps to Christ, page 90.

          Faithfulness and Unfaithfulness in Witnessing
   8. What promise is made to those who faithfully confess Jesus
before men? Matt. 10:32.
   NoTE.—"As you confess Me before men, so I will confess you before God
and the holy angels. You are to be My witnesses upon earth, channels
through which My grace can flow for the healing of the world. . . . He who
would confess Christ must have Christ abiding in him. He cannot communi-
cate that which he has not received."—The Desire of Ages, page 357.

   9. What is said of those who deny Him before men? Matt. 10:33.
   NOTE.—"A spirit contrary to the spirit of Christ would deny Him, what-
ever the profession. Men may deny Christ by evilspeaking, by foolish talking,
by words that are untruthful or unkind. They may deny Him by shunning
life's burdens, by the pursuit of sinful pleasure. They may deny Him by
conforming to the world, by uncourteous behavior, by the love of their own
opinions, by justifying self, by cherishing doubt, borrowing trouble, and
dwelling in darkness. In all these ways they declare that Christ is not in
them."—The Desire of Ages, page 357.

                        Christ's Mission Twofold
   10. What legacy did Jesus bequeath to His disciples? John 14:27.
   NOTE.—"This peace is not the peace that comes through conformity to the
world. Christ never purchased peace by compromise with evil. The peace
that Christ left His disciples is internal rather than external, and was ever to
remain with His witnesses through strife and contention."—The Acts of the
Apostles, page 84.

  11. What apparently conflicting statement did Jesus make? Matt.
10:34.
                                     f4I
  NOTE.—"The Prince of Peace, He was yet the cause of division. He who
came to proclaim glad tidings and to create hope and joy in the hearts of the
children of men, opened a controversy that burns deep and arouses intense
passion in the human heart."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 84.

  12. How are some human relationships affected by Christ's teach-
ings? Matt. 10:35, 36.

   13. How may we prove ourselves unworthy of Jesus? What
choice must we make? Matt. 10:37-39.
   NOTE.—"There is strength for you all in God. But you will never feel your
need of that strength which alone is able to save you, unless you feel your
weakness and sinfulness. Jesus, your precious Saviour, now calls you to take
your position firmly upon the platform of eternal truth. If you suffer with
Him, He will crown you with glory in His everlasting kingdom. If you are
willing to sacrifice all for Him, then,He will be your Saviour. But if you
choose your own way, you will follow on in darkness until it is too late to
secure the eternal reward."—Testimonies, vol. 3, pp. 45, 46.

                The Blessings of Unselfish Ministry
  14. How may we receive Jesus and the Father? Matt. 10:40.

   15. What should be our attitude toward the Lord's messengers?
How will this affect our eternal reward? Matt. 10:41.
   NOTE.—"Those who travel from place to place as evangelists or mission-
aries in any line should receive hospitality from the members of the churches
among whom they may labor. . . . Christ keeps an account of every expense
incurred in entertaining for His sake. • He supplies all that is necessary for
this work. Those who for Christ's sake entertain their brethren, doing their
best to make the visit profitable, both to their guests and to themselves, are
recorded in heaven as worthy of special blessings.. . . No less sure now than
when spoken by our Saviour is the promise that Christ has given, 'He that
receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's re-
ward.' "—Testimonies, vol. 6, pp. 344-347.

   16. What assurance is given that the smallest act of kindness is
noted in heaven? Matt. 10:42.
   NoTE.—"Seize every opportunity to contribute to the happiness of those
around you, sharing with them your affection. Words of kindness, looks of
sympathy, expressions of appreciation, would to many a struggling, lonely
one be as a cup of cold water to a thirsty soul. A word of cheer, an act of
kindness, would go far to lighten the burdens that are resting heavily upon
weary shoulders. It is in unselfish ministry that true happiness is found. And
every word and deed of such service is recorded in the books of heaven as
done for Christ."—Testimonies, vol. 7, p. 50.

  17. When Jesus had ended His instruction to the twelve, what
did He do? Matt. 11:1.
                           [ ]
                     Lesson 2, for October 12, 1946
         Teaching the Disciples and Feeding the
                      Multitude
   LESSON SCRIPTURES: Mark 6:30-44; John 6:4-6, 14.
   MEMORY VERSE: "Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus
did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world." John 6:14.
   STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pages 359-371.

                              Come Rest Awhile
   1. On returning to Jesus from their first missionary tour, what
report did the disciples bring to Him? Mark 6:30.
   NoTE.—"Their intimate relationship with Him encouraged them to lay
before Him their favorable and unfavorable experiences, their joy at seeing
results from their labors, and their sorrow at their failures, their faults, and
their weaknesses."—The Desire of Ages,,page 359.
   2. Seeing their need of rest and further instruction, what did
Jesus say to them? What prevented the accomplishment of His
purpose for them where they were? Mark 6:31.
   NcrrE.—"They had committed errors in their first work as evangelists, and
as they frankly told Christ of their experiences, He saw that they needed
much instruction. He saw, too, that they had become weary in their labors,
and that they needed to rest.
   "But where they then were they could not obtain the needed privacy; 'for
there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to
eat.' The people were thronging after Christ, anxious to be healed, and eager
to listen to His words. Many felt drawn to Him; for He seemed to them to
be the fountain of all blessings. Many of those who then thronged about
Christ to receive the precious boon of 'health accepted Him as their Saviour.
Many others, afraid then to confess Him, because of the Pharisees, were con-
verted at the descent of the Holy Spirit, and, before the angry priests and
rulers, acknowledged Him as the Son of God."—The Desire of Ages, pages
359, 360.
   3. Where did Jesus and His disciples go? When the people saw
them depart, what did they do? Mark 6:32, 33.
   NoTE.—"The rest which Christ and His disciples took was not self-indul-
gent rest. The time they spent in retirement was not devoted to pleasure
seeking. They talked together regarding the work of God, and the possibility
of bringing greater efficiency to the work. The disciples had been with Christ,
and could understand Him; to them He need not talk in parables. He cor-
rected their errors, and made plain to them the right way of approaching the
people. He opened more fully to them the precious treasures of divine truth.
They were vitalized by divine power, and inspired with hope and courage."
—The Desire of Ages, page 361.
                       The Compassionate Saviour
  4. How was the heart of Jesus affected, as He looked upon the
great multitude, and why? What did He do? Mark 6:34.
                                        [6]
   NOTE.—"The people listened to the words of mercy flowing so freely from
the lips of the Son'of God. They heard the gracious words, so simple and so
plain that they were as the balm of Gilead to their souls. The healing of His
divine hand brought gladness and life to the dying, and ease and health to
those suffering with disease. The day seemed to 'them like heaven upon earth,
and they were utterly unconscious of how long it had been since they had
eaten anything."—The Desire of Ages, page 365.

   5. As the night was fast approaching, what did the disciples say
to Jesus? Mark 6:35, 36.
   NoTE.—"At length the day was far spent. The sun was sinking in the west,
and yet the people lingered. Jesus had labored all day without food or rest.
He was pale from weariness and hunger, and the disciples besought Him to
cease from His toil. But He could not withdraw Himself from the multitude
that pressed upon Him.
   "The disciples finally came to Him, urging that for their own sake the
people should be sent away. Many had come from far, and had eaten nothing
since morning."—The Desire of Ages, page 365.

  6. What did Jesus say in reply? Which one of the disciples did
Jesus address in particular? Mark 6:37; John 6:5, 6.

  7. What did Philip say of their inability to feed so many? John
6:7.

  8. What question did Jesus ask of them? What was Andrew's
reply? Mark 6:38; John 6:8, 9.
                          Feeding the Multitude
   9. What    command      did Jesus give concerning the multitude? In
what order were they seated? Mark 6:39, 40.
   NOTE.—"He who taught the people the way to secure peace and happiness
was just as thoughtful of their temporal necessities as of their spiritual need.
The people were weary and faint. There were mothers with babes in their
arms, and little children clinging to their skirts. Many had been standing
for hours. They had been so intensely interested in Christ's words that they
had not once thought of sitting down, and the crowd was so great that there
was danger of their trampling on one another. Jesus would give them a
chance to rest, and He bade them sit down. There was much grass in the
place, and all could rest in comfort."—The Desire of Ages, pages 365, 366.

10. What did Jesus then do? What part did the disciples act?
How amply were the needs of all supplied? Mark 6:41, 42.

  11. What was done with the fragments? How much food re-
mained uneaten? How many were fed? Mark 6:43, 44; Matt. 14:21.
  NOTE.—"These words meant more than putting the bread into the baskets.
The lesson was twofold. Nothing is to be wasted. We are to let slip no tern-
                                   ( '7 I
poral advantage. We should neglect nothing that will tend to benefit a human
being. Let everything be gathered up that will relieve the necessity of earth's
hungry ones. And there should be the same carefulness in spiritual things.
When the baskets of fragments were collected, the people thought of their
friends at home. They wanted them to share in the bread that Christ had
blessed. The contents of the baskets were distributed among the eager throng,
and were carried away into all the region round about. So those who were at
the feast were to give to others the bread that comes down from heaven, to
satisfy the hunger of the soul. They were to repeat what they had learned of
the wonderful things of God. Nothing was to be lost. Not one word that
concerned their eternal salvation was to fall useless to the ground."—The
Desire of Ages, page 368.
  12. When the people saw the miracle that Jesus did, what did
they say? John 6:14.


                   Lesson 3, for October 19, 1946
                   Jesus Walks on the Water
   LESSON SCRIPTURES: Matthew 14:22-33; John 6:15, 21, 26, 27; Mark
6:48, 53-56.
   MEMORY VERSE: "In the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them,
walking on the sea. And when the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were
troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear." Matthew 14:25, 26.
   STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pages 377-385.

                  An Attempt to Make Jesus King
   1. Following the feeding of the multitude, what did Jesus con-
strain the disciples to do? What did He do? Matt. 14:22, 23.
   NoTE.—"Calling His disciples, Jesus bids them take the boat and return at
once to Capernaum, leaving Him to dismiss the people. Never before had a
command from Christ seemed so impossible of fulfillment."—The Desire of
Ages, page 378.
   2. What was the purpose of the multitude concerning Jesus?
When He perceived their purpose, what did He do? John 6:15.
    NOTE.—"Violence and insurrection would follow an effort to place Him
on the throne, and the work of the spiritual kingdom would be hindered.
Without delay the movement must be checked. . . .
   "The disciples had long hoped for a popular movement to place Jesus on
the throne; they could not endure the thought that all this enthusiasm should
come to nothing. . . . They protested against the arrangement; but Jesus
now spoke with an authority He had never before assumed toward them.
They knew that further opposition on their part would be useless, and in
silence they turned toward the sea."—The Desire of Ages, page 378.
   3. What hardship did the disciples experience in crossing the
lake? Who saw them in their distress? When did Jesus go to them,
and how? Mark 6:48.
   NOTE.—"Jesus had not forgotten them. The Watcher on the shore saw
those fear-stricken men battling with the tempest. Not for a moment did
                                    [8]
He lose sight of His disciples. With deepest solicitude His eyes followed the
storm-tossed boat with its precious burden; for these men were to be the
light of the world. As a mother in tender love watches her child, so the com-
passionate Master watched His disciples. When their hearts were subdued,
their unholy ambition quelled, and in humility they prayed for help, it was
given them."—The Desire of Ages, page 381.

   4. When the disciples saw Jesus, how were they affected? What
did they say? How,did Jesus quiet their fears? Matt. 14:25-27.
   Nora.—"They think it a phantom that omens their destruction, and they
cry out for fear. Jesus advances as if He would pass them; but they recog-
nize Him, and cry out, entreating His help. Their beloved Master turns, His
voice silences their fear, 'Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid.' "—The
Desire of Ages, page 381.

                           Peter's Experience
  5. What did Peter say to Jesus? What was the Saviour's reply?
Matt. 14:28, 29, first part.
  NOTE.—"As soon as they could credit the wondrous fact, Peter was almost
beside himself with joy. As if he could scarcely yet believe, he cried out,
`Lord, if it be Thou, bid me come unto Thee on the water.. And He said,
Come.' "—The Desire of Ages, page 381.

   6. For a time what was Peter able to do? What did he see that
caused fear? What two things followed? Matt. 14:29, 30.
   NOTE.—"Looking unto Jesus, Peter walks securely; but as in self-satisfac-
tion he glances back toward his companions in the boat, his eyes are turned
from the Saviour. The wind is boisterous. The waves roll high, and come
directly between him and the Master; and he is afraid. For a moment Christ
is hidden from his view, and his faith gives way. He begins to sink. But
while the billows talk with death, Peter lifts his eyes from the angry waters,
and fixing them upon Jesus, cries, 'Lord, save me.' "—The Desire of Ages,
page 381.

   7. What was the Saviour's immediate response? What words of
reproof were kindly spoken? Matt. 14:31.
   NOTE.—"When trouble comes upon us, how often we are like Peter! We
look upon the waves, instead of keeping our eyes fixed upon the Saviour.
Our footsteps slide, and the proud waters go over our souls. Jesus did not
bid Peter come to Him that he should perish; He does not call us to follow
Him, and then forsake us."—The Desire of Ages, page 382.

   8. What was the immediate effect of Jesus' entrance into the
ship? What did those in the ship do and say? Matt. 14:32, 33;
John 6:21.
   NorE.—"No sooner had Jesus taken His place in the boat than the wind
ceased, 'and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went.' The
night of horror was succeeded by the light of dawn. The disciples, and others
who also were on board, bowed at the feet of Jesus with thankful hearts,
                                     [9]
saying, 'Of a truth Thou art the Son of God l'"—The Desire of Ages, page 382.
   "Jesus read the character of His disciples. He knew how sorely their faith
was to be tried. In this incident on the sea He desired to reveal to'Peter his
own weakness,—to show that his safety was in constant dependence upon
divine power. Amid the storms of temptation he could walk safely only as in
utter self-distrust he should rely upon the Saviour. It was on the point where
he thought himself strong that Peter was weak; and not until he discerned
his weakness could he realize his need of dependence upon Christ. Had he
learned the lesson that Jesus sought to teach him in that experience on the
sea, he would not have failed when the great test came upon him."—Ibid.,
page 382.
                          Jesus Heals Many Sick
   9. Where did Jesus and His disciples land? When the people
learned of the presence of Jesus, what did they do? Mark 6:53-55.
   NorE.—This was near the scene of the healing of the demoniac, and where
because of the destruction of the swine, the inhabitants had besought Jesus
"to depart out of their coasts." Mark 5:17. Large crowds now listen to the
words of life from Jesus. There is doubtless a direct connection between this
interest, and the testimony of the would-be disciple, who had been bidden to
remain as a home missionary, and who faithfully published "in Decapolis how
great things Jesus had done for him." Verse 20. Of his faithful witness, it is
written: "Men marveled as they listened to the wondrous news. A door was
opened to the gospel throughout that region. When Jesus returned to Decap-
olis, the people flocked about Him, and for three days, not merely the in-
habitants of one town, but thousands from all the surrounding region, heard
the message of salvation."—The Desire of Ages, page 340.

   10. How far-reaching was this interest in Jesus? What did they
do with their sick? Mark 6:56.
   NOTE.—"The miracle of the loaves was reported far and near, and very
early next morning the people flocked to Bethsaida to see Jesus. They came
in great numbers, by land and sea. Those who had left Him the preceding
night returned, expecting to find Him still there; for there had been no boat
by which He could pass to the other side. But their search was fruitless, and
many repaired to Capernaum, still seeking Him."—The Desire of Ages, page
383.
                           Life's Highest Aim
   11. What did Jesus say concerning the motive that prompted
many in seeking Him? John 6:26.
   NOTE.—"If men could have had the world with Christ, multitudes would
have proffered Him their allegiance; but such service He could not accept.
Of those now connected with Him there were many who had been attracted
by the hope of a worldly kingdom. These must be undeceived. The deep
spiritual teaching in the miracle of the loaves had not been comprehended.
This was to be made plain. And this new revelation would bring with it a
closer test."—The Desire of Ages, page 383.
  12. What is the high aim in life for which each one should
earnestly strive? From whom will it be received by those who labor
successfully? John 6:27.

                   Lesson 4, for October 26, 1946
                       The Crisis in Galilee
   LESSON SCRIPTURE: John 6:28-71.
   MEMORY VERSE: "It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing:
the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life." John 6:63.
   STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pages 383-394.

                             Stubborn Unbelief
   1. After finding Jesus in the synagogue in Capernaum, what
question did the people ask Him, indicating an awakened interest?
John 6:28.
   NorE.—"For the moment the interest of the hearers was awakened. They
exclaimed, 'What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?' They
had been performing many and burdensome works in order to recommend
themselves to God; and they were ready to hear of any new observance by
which they could secure greater merit. Their question meant, What shall we
do that we may deserve heaven? What is the price we are required to pay
in order to obtain the life to come?"—The Desire of Ages, page 385.

   2. What was His reply? John 6:29.
  NOTE.—"The price of heaven is Jesus. The way to heaven is through faith
in 'the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.' "—The Desire
of Ages, page 385.

   3. What further question did the people ask Jesus? What did
they say about the fathers? John 6:30, 31.
   NorE.—"Christ had indeed once fed the multitude with barley loaves; but
in the days of Moses, Israel had been fed with manna forty years, and far
greater blessings were expected from the Messiah. Their dissatisfied hearts
queried why, if Jesus could perform so many wondrous works as they had
witnessed, could He not give health, strength, and riches to all His people,
free them from their oppressors, and exalt them to power and honor?"—The
Desire of Ages, page 385.

  4. How did Jesus endeavor to correct the false view of the One
who gave the manna in the wilderness? John 6:32.
  NOTE.—"The Jews honored Moses as the giver of the manna, ascribing
praise to the instrument, and losing sight of Him by whom the work had
been accomplished. Their fathers had murmured against Moses, and had
doubted and denied his divine mission. Now in the same spirit the children
                                   [11 ]
rejected the One who bore the message of God to themselves. 'Then said
Jesus unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that
bread from heaven.' The giver of the manna was standing among them. It
was Christ Himself who had led the Hebrews through the wilderness, and
had daily fed them with the bread from heaven. That food was a type of the
real bread from heaven."—The Desire of Ages, pages 385, 386.

   5. Who is the bread of God? What did the people say? John
6:33, 34.
                       A Plain Declaration
  6. What three things did Jesus tell them plainly? What was
their attitude? John 6:35, 36.
  NOTE.—"Only the day before, the great multitude, when faint and weary,
had been fed by the bread which He had given. As from that bread they had
received physical strength and refreshment, so from Christ they might receive
spiritual strength unto eternal life."—The Desire of Ages, page 386.


   7. What promise is made to all who believe on Jesus? For what
purpose did Jesus come? What is the Father's will, and what does
it embrace? John 6:37-40.

  8. What caused the Jews to murmur? In what words did thy
refer to the lowly birth of Jesus? John 6:41, 42.
   NoTE.—"They tried to arouse prejudice by referring scornfully to the lowly
origin of Jesus. They contemptuously alluded to His life as a Galilean laborer,
and to His family as being poor and lowly. The claims of this uneducated
carpenter, they said, were unworthy of their attention. And on account of
His mysterious birth they insinuated that He was of doubtful parentage, thus
representing the human circumstances of His birth as a blot upon His his-
tory"—The Desire of Ages, page 387.

               The Drawing Power of Love
9. Who only can come to Jesus? Who are to be taught of God?
And who only have seen the Father? John 6:43-46; Isa. 54:13.
 NOTE.—"None will ever come to Christ, save those who respond to the
drawing of the Father's love. But God is drawing all hearts unto Him, and
only those who resist His drawing will refuse to come to Christ."—The Desire
of Ages, page 387.
                       The Bread of Life
  10. What is the result of believing on Jesus? What did Jesus say
further concerning the Bread of Life? John 6:47-51.

   11. What statement was especially hard for the Jews to under-
stand? What more did Jesus say concerning eating His flesh and
drinking His blood? John 6:52-58.
                             [ 12 ]
   NorE.—"The Jews were about to celebrate the Passover at Jerusalem, in
commemoration of the night of Israel's deliverance, when the destroying
angel smote the homes of Egypt. In the paschal lamb God desired them to
behold the Lamb of God, and through the symbol receive Him who gave
Himself for the life of the world. .. . The same truth that was symbolized in
the paschal service was taught in the words of Christ. But it was still undis-
cerned. . .
   "To eat the flesh and drink the blood of Christ is to receive Him as a per-
sonal Saviour, believing that He forgives our sins, and that we are complete
in Him. It is by beholding His love, by dwelling upon it, by drinking it in,
that we are to become partakers of His nature."--The Desire of Ages, pages
388, 389.
                            The Crucial Test
   12. Where was Jesus as He thus taught? How were many of the
disciples affected by His teaching? John 6:59, 60.
   NOTE.—"The unbelieving Jews refused to see any except the most literal
meaning in the Saviour's words. By the ritual law they were forbidden to
taste blood, and they now construed Christ's language into a sacrilegious
speech, and disputed over it among themselves. Many even of the disciples
said, 'This is an hard saying; who can hear it?' "—The Desire of Ages,. page
390.
   13. In response to the murmuring of His disciples, what ques-
tions did Jesus, ask? John 6:61, 62.

   14. How did Jesus explain the meaning of His teaching con-
cerning the spirit and the flesh? What did He say of His words?
What did He say of some who heard Him? What had He known
from the beginning? John 6:63-65.
   NOTE.—"Christ calls upon His people 10. believe and practice His word.
Those who receive and assimilate this word, making it a part of every action,
of every attribute of character, will grow strong in the strength of God."—
Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 300.
   15. From that time what did many of the disciples of Jesus do?
John 6:66.
   NoTE.—"By the public rebuke of their unbelief these disciples were still.
further alienated from Jesus. . . . They had made their choice,—had taken
the form without the spirit, the husk without the kernel. Their decision was
never afterward reversed; for they walked no more with Jesus."—The Desire
of Ages, page 392.
   16. What decisive question did Jesus ask the twelve? What was
Peter's reply? John 6:67-69.
   NOTE.—"When Jesus presented the testing truth that caused so many of
His disciples to turn back, He knew what would be the result of His words;
but He had a purpose of mercy to fulfill. He foresaw that in the hour of
temptation every one of His beloved disciples would be severely tested. His
agony in Gethsemane, His betrayal and crucifixion, would be to them a most
trying ordeal. Had no previous test been given, many who were actuated by
merely selfish motives would have been connected with them. . . . In that
                                    [ ut 3
hour of darkness, the example of those who turned from Him might have
carried others with them. But Jesus brought about this crisis while by His
personal presence He could still strengthen the faith of His true followers.
   "Compassionate Redeemer, who in the full knowledge of the doom that
awaited Him, tenderly smoothed the way for the disciples, prepared them for
their crowning trial, and strengthened them for the final test1"—The Desire
of Ages, page 394.
  17. What sad declaration did Jesus make regarding one of the
twelve associated with Him? John 6:70, 71.


                  Lesson 5, for November 2, 1946
            Answering the Pharisees; Visiting

                        Ceremonial Purification
  1. Following the crisis in Galilee, who came to Jesus, and whence
did they come? Mark 7:1.

  2. What did this deputation see, what did they say, and what
was their attitude? Mark 7:2; Matt. 15:1, 2.
   3. What ceremonial precepts were strictly enforced by the Jews?
What were some of these precepts? Mark 7:3, 4. See marginal
reading.
   NOTE.—"As before, the ground of complaint was His disregard of the tra-
ditional precepts that encumbered the law of God. These were professedly
designed to guard the observance of the law, but they were regarded as more
sacred than the law itself. When they came in collision with the command-
ments given from Sinai, preference was given to the rabbinical precepts.
   "Among the observances most strenuously enforced was that of ceremonial
purification. A neglect of the forms to be observed before eating was ac-
counted a heinous sin, to be punished both in this world and in the next; and
it was regarded as a virtue to destroy the transgressor."—The Desire of Ages,
page 395.
   4. What question did the Pharisees and scribes ask Jesus? What
was His answer? What did He say they were? Mark 7:5, 6; Isa.
29:13.
   NOTE.—"Christ and His disciples did not observe these ceremonial wash-
ings, and the spies made this neglect the ground of their accusation. They
did not, however, make a direct attack on Christ, but came to Him with
criticism of His disciples."—The Desire of Ages, page 396.
                                     (14 7
             The Commandments of God or the
                       Traditions of Men -
   5. What great truth did Jesus enunciate regarding the worship
of God? Mark 7:7; Matt. 15:3, 9.
   NoTE.—"The words of Christ were an arraignment of the whole system
of Pharisaism. He declared that by placing their requirements above the
divine precepts the rabbis were setting themselves above God.
   "The deputies from Jerusalem were filled with rage. They could not
accuse Christ as a violator of the law given from Sinai, for He spoke as its
defender against their traditions. The great precepts of the law, which He
had presented, appeared in striking contrast to the petty rules that men had
devised."—The Desire of Ages, page 397.
  6. How did Jesus further emphasize the disloyalty to God of all
who hold the traditions of men in opposition to the commandments
of God? Mark 7:8, 9.
  7. How did Jesus illustrate the fact that they were making the
word of God of none effect by their tradition? Mark 7:10-13; Matt.
15:4-6.
                      Heart Defilement
  8. What did Jesus next do? What did He say? Mark 7:14-16.
   NorE.—"To the multitude, and afterward more fully to His disciples,
Jesus explained that defilement comes not from without, but from within.
Purity and impurity pertain to the soul. It is the evil deed, the evil word,
the evil thought, the transgression of the law of God, not the neglect of
external, man-made ceremonies, that defiles a man."—The Desire of Ages,
page 397.
9. What did the disciples say to Jesus? What was His reply?
Matt. 15:12-14.
 NOTE.—"The disciples noted the rage of the spies as their false teaching
was exposed. They saw the angry looks, and heard the half-muttered words
of dissatisfaction and revenge. Forgetting how often Christ had given evi-
dence that He read the heart as an open book, they told Him of the effect
of His words. Hoping that He might conciliate the enraged officials, they said
to Jesus, `Knowest Thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard
this saying?' "—The Desire of Ages, pages 397, 398.
  10. Having retired with His disciples to the quiet of a certain
home, what question did they ask Jesus? How did He answer
them? Mark 7:17-20.
   11. Whence do evil thoughts proceed? What evils are men-
tioned? Mark 7:21-23.
                   Breaking Down Barriers
   12. After His encounter with the Pharisees at Capernaum, to
what place did Jesus go with His disciples? How did He seek re-
tirement? With what result? Mark 7:24.
                                    [ 15 ]
   NOTE.—"The work before Him now was to prepare His disciples for their
mission. In coming to this region He hoped to find the retirement He had
failed to secure at Bethsaida. Yet this was not His only purpose in taking
this journey."—The Desire of Ages, page 399.

   13. Who earnestly sought Jesus? Of what nation was this sup-
pliant? For what purpose did she come? What did she do? Mark
7:25, 26; Matt. 15:22.
   NoTE.—"This woman had heard of the prophet, who, it was reported,
healed all manner of diseases. As she heard of His power, hope sprung up in
her heart. Inspired by a mother's love, she determined to present her daugh-
ter's case to Him. It was her resolute purpose to bring her affliction to Jesus.
He must heal her child. She had sought help from the heathen gods, but had
obtained no relief. And at times she was tempted to think, What can this
Jewish teacher do for me? But the word had come, He heals all manner of
diseases, whether those who come to Him for help are rich or poor. She de-
termined not to lose her only hope."—The Desire of Ages, pages 399, 400.

  14. At first how did Jesus treat the appeal of this poor, distressed
woman? What did His disciples say to Him? What was His reply?
Matt. 15:23, 24.
                             Faith Triumphant
   15. How did she press her appeal? What answer did Jesus give
her? Matt. 15:25, 26; Mark 7:27.
   NOTE.—"By ministering to her sorrow, He could give a living representa-
tion of the lesson He designed to teach. For this He had brought His disciples
into this region.... Christ did not immediately reply to the woman's request.
He received this representative of a despised race as the Jews would have
done. In this He designed that His disciples should be impressed with the
cold and heartless manner in which the Jews would treat such a case, as
evinced by His reception of the woman, and the compassionate manner in
which He would have them deal with such distress, as manifested by His
subsequent granting of her petition."—The Desire of Ages, page 400.

   16. What was this woman's triumphant reply? Matt. 15:27.

   17. How did Jesus answer her? What was the result of the won-
derful faith of this formerly heathen woman? Matt. 15:28.
   NOTE.—"The Saviour is satisfied. He has tested her faith in Him. By His
dealings with her, He has shown that she who has been regarded as an out-
cast from Israel is no longer an alien, but a child in God's household. . . .
   "This was the only miracle that Jesus wrought while on this journey. It
was for the performance of this act that He went to the borders of Tyre and
Sidon. He wished to relieve the afflicted woman, and at the same time to
leave an example in His work of mercy toward one of a despised people for
the benefit of His disciples when He should no longer be with them. He
wished to lead them from their Jewish exclusiveness to be interested in
working for others besides their own people."—The Desire of Ages, pages
401, 402.
                                     [ 16 ]
  18. What encouragement is given to God's people to pray perse-
veringly? Mark 11:24.
   NOTE.—"I asked the angel why there was no more faith and power in
Israel. He said, 'Ye let go of the arm of the Lord too soon. Press your
petitions to the throne, and hold on by strong faith. The promises are sure.
Believe ye receive the things ye ask for, and ye shall have them.' "—Early
Writings, page 73.

               Healing a Deaf and Dumb Man
   1. Leaving Tyre and Sidon, where did Jesus go? Mark 7:31.

   2. What afflicted person was brought to Jesus? What did his
friends beseech Him to do? Mark 7:32.

  3. What did Jesus do to remove the man's infirmities? Mark
7:33-35.
  4, After the afflicted man was made whole, what charge did
Jesus give? How was this charge disregarded? Mark 7:36.
            Wiping Away Tears and Again Feeding
                         the Multitude
  5. How did the wonderful manifestations of divine power in
healing the multitudes affect the people? What did they do? Matt.
15:30, 31; Mark 7:37.
   NOTE.—"Jesus went up into a mountain, and there the multitude flocked
to Him, bringing their sick and lame, and laying them at His feet. He healed
them all; and the people, heathen as they were, glorified the God of Israel.
For three days they continued to throng about the Saviour, sleeping at night
in the open air, and through the day pressing eagerly to hear the words of
Christ, and to see His works."—The Desire of Ages, page 404.
   6. Having been on the mountain with Jesus for three days, what
 was the condition of the multitude? Calling His disciples, what
 did Jesus say to them? Mark 8:1-3.
    7. What question arose in the minds of the disciples? Mark 8:4.
                                    [ 17 ]
   NoTE.—"Again the disciples revealed their unbelief. At Bethsaida they had
seen how, with Christ's blessing, their little store availed for the feeding of
the multitude; yet they did not now bring forward their all [italics ours],
trusting His power to multiply it for the hungry crowds. Moreover, those
whom He fed at Bethsaida were Jews; these were Gentiles and heathen.
Jewish prejudice was still strong in the hearts of the disciples, and they
answered Jesus, 'Whence can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the
wilderness?' "—The Desire of Ages, pages 404, 405.

  8. What question did Jesus ask the disciples? What was their
reply? What did Jesus then do? Mark 8:5, 6.

  9. What additional supply of food did the disciples have? What
did Jesus do with this? How were the needs of the people supplied,
and how much was left? Mark 8:7, 8; Matt. 15:37.

  10. How many were fed? After dismissing the multitude, where
did Jesus go? Matt. 15:38, 39.
  11. Who at this time came to Jesus? What were these leaders
among the Jews seeking? What was their motive? Matt. 16:1;
Mark 8:11.
  12. How did Jesus answer these cavilers? What did He call
them? What sign only was to be given that generation? Matt.
16:2-4.
  NOTE.—"Every miracle that Christ performed was a sign of His divinity.
He was doing the very work that had been foretold of the Messiah; but to
the Pharisees these works of mercy were a positive offense. . . .
   "That which led the Jews to reject the Saviour's work was the highest
evidence of His divine character. The greatest significance of His miracles
is seen in the fact that they were for the blessing of humanity. The highest
evidence that He came from God is that His life revealed the character of
God. He did the works and spoke the words of God. Such a life is the
greatest of all miracles."—The Desire of Ages, pages 406, 407.

                    Leaven of the Pharisees
  13. As Jesus and His disciples entered the ship to sail to Beth-
saida, what had the disciples forgotten? How much food did they
have with them? Mark 8:13, 14.
  14. What charge did Jesus give the disciples? How did they
reason? Mark 8:15, 16.
  NOTE.—"The great truth of the conversion of the heart by the Holy Spirit
is presented in Christ's words to Nicodemus: 'Verily, verily, I say unto thee,
Except a man be born from above, he cannot see the kingdom of God. .
That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit
is spirit.' "—Christ's Object Lessons, page 98.
                                      [ 18 ]
   "In like manner the leaven of sin must be put away from all who would
receive life and nourishment from Christ."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page
278.
  15. What did Jesus say of their reasoning? Of what two miracles
did He remind them? What questions concerning those miracles
did He ask? Mark 8:17-21.
   NorE.—"Now Jesus reproved them for thinking that He who had fed
thousands with a few fishes and barley loaves could in that solemn warning
have referred merely to temporal food. There was danger that the crafty
reasoning of the Pharisees and the Sadducees would leaven His disciples with
unbelief, causing them to think lightly of the works of Christ."—The Desire
of Ages, page 408.
  16. How were the disciples led to comprehend the Saviour's les-
son regarding leaven? Matt. 16:11, 12.
   NorE.—"The hypocrisy of the Pharisees was the product of self-seeking.
The glorification of themselves was the object of their lives. It was this that
led them to pervert and misapply the Scriptures, and blinded them to the
purpose of Christ's mission. This subtle evil even the disciples of Christ were
in danger of cherishing.... As leaven, if left to complete its work, will cause
corruption and decay, so does the self-seeking spirit, cherished, work the de-
filement and ruin of the soul."—The Desire of Ages, pages 408, 409.

was brought to Jesus? What did Jesus do? Mark 8:22, 23, first
part.
  2. After having laid His hands upon the man, what question did
Jesus ask? What reply did the man make? What did Jesus do the
second time, and what was the result? What did He tell the man?

  4. How personal did Jesus then make His question? Who re-
plied? What was his answer? What charge did Jesus give? Mark
8:29, 30; Matt. 16:15, 16.
                                     [ 19
   NOTE.—"From the first, Peter had believed Jesus to be the Messiah. . . .
Many of the disciples who had ardently expected Jesus to take His place on
David's throne left Him when they perceived that He had no such intention.
But Peter and his companions turned not from their allegiance. . . .
   "On this day, before they were brought face to face with the great trial
of their faith, the Holy Spirit rested upon them in power. For a little time
their eyes were turned away from 'the things which are seen,' to behold 'the
things which are not seen' Beneath the guise of humanity they discerned the
glory of the Son of God."—The Desire of Ages, pages 411, 412.

    5. What blessing did Jesus pronounce upon Peter? Who had
revealed to Peter the truth contained in his wonderful confession?
Matt. 16:17; 1 Cor. 2:9, 10.
    NorE.—"The truth which Peter had confessed is the foundation of the be-
liever's faith. It is that which Christ Himself has declared to be eternal
life."—The Desire of Ages, page 412.

   6. What is the foundation upon which the church is built? With
such a foundation how secure is the church? Matt. 16:18; 1 Cor.
3:11.
   NorE.—"The word Peter signifies a stone,—a rolling stone. Peter was not
the rock upon which the church was founded. The gates of hell did prevail
against him when he denied his Lord with cursing and swearing. The church
was built upon One against whom the gates of hell could not prevail. . . .
   "In the presence of God, and all the heavenly intelligences, in the presence
of the unseen army of hell, Christ founded His church upon the living Rock.
That Rock is Himself,—His own body, for us broken and bruised. Against
the church built upon this foundation, the gates of hell shall not prevail."—
The Desire of Ages, pages 412, 413.

  7. How did Jesus honor Peter and all other faithful shepherds
of the flock of God? What charge did Jesus give? Matt. 16:19, 20.
   NorE.—"Peter had expressed the truth• which is the foundation of the
church's faith, and Jesus now honored him as the representative of the whole
body of believers.. ..
    " 'The keys of the kingdom of heaven' are the words of Christ. All the
words of Holy Scripture are His, and are here included. These words have
power to open and to shut heaven. They declare the conditions upon which
men are received or rejected. Thus the work of those who preach God's word
is a savor of life unto life or of death unto death. Theirs is a mission weighted
with eternal results."—The Desire of Ages, pages 413, 414.

                       The Shadow of the Cross
   8. What experience that must come to Jesus did He make known
at this time to His disciples? How did Peter rebuke Jesus? Mark
8:31, 32.
                                     [ 20 ]
   9. What reproof did Jesus administer? When, and to whom had
He spoken similar words of rebuke? Mark 8:33; Luke 4:1, 2, first
part, 8.
   NorE.—"Satan was trying to discourage Jesus, and turn Him from His
mission; and Peter, in his blind love, was giving voice to the temptation.
The prince of evil was the author of the thought. His instigation was behind
that impulsive appeal. . . . The words of Christ were spoken, not to Peter,
but to the one who was trying to separate him from his Redeemer."—The
Desire of Ages, page 416.
                    Cross-Bearing and Self-Denial
    10. Whom did Jesus next call to Him? What principle of self-
surrender did He require of those who would follow Him? Mark
8:34; Luke 9:23.
    NOTE.—"Jesus now explained to His disciples that His own life of self-
abnegation was an example of what theirs should be.... To the disciples His
words, though dimly comprehended, pointed to their submission to the most
bitter humiliation,—submission even unto death for the sake of Christ. No
more complete self-surrender could the Saviour's words have pictured. But
all this He had accepted for them."—The Desire of Ages, pages 416, 417.

   11. What great principle of truth is to be our guide in the hour
of supreme trial? Mark 8:35; Rev. 2:10.
   NorE.—"Selfishness is death. No organ of the body could live should it
confine its service to itself. The heart, failing to send its lifeblood to the hand
and the head, would quickly lose its power. As our lifeblood, so is the love of
Christ diffused through every part of His mystical body. We are members
one of another, and the soul that refuses to impart will perish."—The Desire
of Ages, page 417.                                  •
   12. What comparison is made by Jesus of true values? Mark
8:36, 37.
   NorE.—"Christ calls upon everyone to consider. Make an honest reckon-
ing. Put into one scale Jesus, which means eternal treasure, life, truth, heaven,
and the joy of Christ in souls redeemed; put into the other every attraction
the world can offer. Into one scale put the loss of your own soul, and the
souls of those whom you might have been instrumental in saving; into the
other, for yourself and for them, a life that measures with the life of God.
Weigh for time and for eternity. While you are thus engaged, Christ speaks:
`What shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world,•and lose his own
soul?' "—Christ's Object Lessons, page 374.

  13. What does Jesus say of one whose only treasure is in the
earth? When will this decisive hour come? Mark 8:38.

   14. To encourage their fainting hearts, what did Jesus say of
some who were present? Matt. 16:28.
   NOTE.—"Beyond the poverty and humiliation of the present, He pointed
the disciples to His coming in glory, not in the splendor of an earthly throne,
                                    [ 21 ]
but with'the glory of God and the hosts of heaven. .. . But the disciples did
Rot comprehend His words. The glory seemed far away. Their eyes were
fixed upon the nearer view, the earthly life of poverty, humiliation, and suf-
fering. Must their glowing expectations of the Messiah's kingdom be relin-
quished? Were they not to see their Lord exalted to the throne of David?
Could it be that Christ was to live, a humble, homeless wanderer, to be de-
spised, rejected, and put to death? Sadness oppressed their hearts, for they
loved their Master. Doubt also harassed their minds, for it seemed incom-
prehensible that the Son of God should be subjected to such cruel humilia-
tion."—The Desire of Ages, pages 417, 418.

                         "In the Holy Mount"
   1. After Jesus had instructed His disciples regarding His suffer-
ings and death, what did He do? Whom did He take with Him?
Matt. 17:1.
   NOTE.—"The Saviour and His disciples have spent the day in traveling and
teaching, and the mountain climb adds to their weariness. Christ has lifted
burdens from mind and body of many sufferers; He has sent the thrill of life
through their enfeebled frames; but He also is compassed with humanity, and
with His disciples He is wearied with the ascent."—The Desire of Ages, page
419.
   2. What was the purpose in taking the favored three into this
high mountain? Luke 9:28.
   NoTE.—"Presently Christ tells them that they are now to go no farther.
Stepping a little aside from them, the Man of Sorrows pours out His suppli-
cations with strong crying and tears. He prays for strength to endure the test
in behalf of humanity. He must Himself gain a fresh hold on Omnipotence,
for only thus can He contemplate the future. And He pours out His heart
longings for His disciples, that in the hour of the power of darkness their
faith may not fail. The dew is heavy upon His bowed form, but He heeds it
not. The shadows of night gather thickly about Him, but He regards not
their gloom. So the hours pass slowly by. At first the disciples unite their
prayers with His in sincere devotion; but after a time they are overcome with
weariness, and, even while trying to retain their interest in the scene, they
fall asleep."—The Desire of Ages, pages 419, 420.
  3. In fulfillment of the promise recorded in Mark 9:1, what
event then took place? Mark 9:2.
                                      22
                          The Transfiguration
   4. Describe the wonderful change that took place in the appear-
ance of Jesus while He was engaged in prayer. Matt. 17:2.
   NoTE.—"His prayer is heard. While He is bowed in lowliness upon the
stony ground, suddenly the heavens open, the golden gates of the city of God
are thrown wide, and holy radiance descends upon the mount, enshrouding
the Saviour's form. Divinity from within flashes through humanity, and
meets the glory coming from above. Arising from His prostrate position,
Christ stands in Godlike majesty. The soul agony is gone. His countenance
now shines 'as the sun,' and His garments are 'white as the light.' "—The
Desire of Ages, page 421.

  5. At this time who appeared? What were they doing? Matt.
17:3.

   6. About what did these two heavenly visitors talk with Jesus?
Luke 9:30, 31.
   NoTE.—"Not the inauguration of Christ as king, but the decease to be
accomplished at Jerusalem, is the subject of their conference with Jesus. . . .
Now heaven had sent its messengers to Jesus; not angels, but men who had
endured suffering and sorrow, and who could sympathize with the Saviour in
the trial of His earthly life. Moses and Elijah had been colaborers with
Christ. They had shared His longing for the salvation of men. Moses bad
pleaded for Israel: 'Yet now, if Thou wilt forgive their sin—; and if not,
blot me, I pray Thee, out of Thy book which Thou hast written.' Elijah
had known loneliness of spirit, as for three years and a half of famine he had
borne the burden of the nation's hatred and its woe. Alone he had stood for
God' upon Mount Carmel. Alone he had fled to the desert in anguish and
despair. These men, chosen above every angel around the throne, had come
to commune with Jesus concerning the scenes of His suffering, and to comfort
Him with the assurance of the sympathy of heaven. The hope of the world,
the salvation of every human being, was the burden of their interview."—
The Desire of Ages, pages 422, 425.

   7. Why did the three disciples not benefit fully from the con-
versation designed to enlighten and strengthen them for future
trials? Luke 9:32.
   NoTE.—"Through being overcome with sleep, the disciples heard little of
what passed between Christ and the heavenly messengers. Failing to watch
and pray, they had not received that which God desired to give them —a
knowledge of the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow. The
                                                                          y
lost the blessing that might have been theirs through sharing His self-sacri-
fice. Slow of heart to believe were these disciples, little appreciative of the
treasure with which Heaven sought to enrich them."—The Desire of Ages,
page 425.

8. Referring to this marvelous manifestation of kingly glory,
what did Peter say to Jesus? Matt. 17:4.
                               28
                     Crowning Evidence
  9. While Peter was yet speaking, what did they behold? What
did they hear? How were the disciples affected by what they heard?
Matt. 17:5, 6.
  NOTE.—"While they were still gazing on the scene upon the mount, 'a
bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which
said, This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye Him.' As
they beheld the cloud of glory, brighter than that which went before the
tribes of Israel in the wilderness; as they heard the voice of God speak in
awful majesty that caused the mountain to tremble, the disciples fell smitten
to the earth."—The Desire of Ages, page 425.

  10. What 'words of assurance did Jesus speak to them? Lifting
up their eyes, what only did they see? Matt. 17:7, 8.
  NOTE.—"They remained prostrate, their faces hidden, till Jesus came near,
and touched them, dispelling their fears with His well-known voice, 'Arise,
and be not afraid.' Venturing to lift up their eyes, they saw that the heavenly
glory had passed away, the forms of Moses and Elijah had disappeared. They
were upon the mount, alone with Jesus."—The Desire of Ages, page 425.
                  Light Shining in Darkness
  11. Long after the transfiguration, how did Peter refer to that
experience? Of what was he an eyewitness? 2 Peter 1:16-18.

  12. What did the apostle declare was "more sure" than the tes-
timony of sight or hearing? 2 Peter 1:19.
  NOTE.—Our senses may deceive us, but the word of prophecy—the Bible—
never fails or deceives. Although we may misunderstand its true meaning,
yet it will surely come to pass.

  13. As the disciples were coming down the mountain; what
charge did Jesus give them? Mark 9:9.


                  Lesson 9, for November 30, 1946
                     The Triumph of Faith
   LESSON SCRIPTURES: Mark 9:14-27; Matthew 17:14-21.
   MEMORY VERSE: "Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are
possible to him that believeth." Mark 9:23.
   STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pages 426-431.

                       Ministry of Love
  1. Coming down the next morning from the mount of transfigu-
ration, what did Jesus see? What were the scribes doing? Mark
9:14.
                             f 24 I
   NOTE.—"The entire night had been passed in the mountain; and as the
sun arose, Jesus and His disciples descended to the plain. Absorbed in thought,
the disciples were awed and silent. Even Peter had not a word to say. Gladly
would they have lingered in that holy place which had been touched with the
light of heaven, and where the Son of God had manifested His glory; but
there was work to be done for the people, who were already searching far
and near for Jesus.
   "At the foot of the mountain a large company had gathered, led hither by
the disciples who had remained behind, but who knew whither Jesus had re-
sorted."—The Desire of Ages, page 426.


  2. When the people saw Jesus, how were they affected? What
did they do? Mark 9:15.
 - NOTE.—"As the people on the plain caught sight of Jesus, they ran to meet
Him, greeting Him with expressions of reverence and joy. Yet His quick eye
discerned that they were in great perplexity. The disciples appeared troubled.
A circumstance had just occurred that had caused them bitter disappointment
and humiliation."—The Desire of Ages, pages 426, 427.


   3. What question did Jesus ask the scribes? Mark 9:16.

  4. What explanation did one of the multitude give? How serious
was the affliction of his only son? Mark 9:17, 18; Matt. 17:14-16.
   NOTE.—"While they were waiting at the foot of the mountain, a father
had brought to them his son, to be delivered from a dumb spirit that tor-
mented him. Authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, had been con-
ferred on the disciples when Jesus sent out the twelve to preach through
Galilee. As they went forth strong in faith, the evil spirits had obeyed their
word. Now in the name of Christ they commanded the torturing spirit to
leave his victim; but the demon only mocked them by a fresh display of his
power. The disciples, unable to account for their defeat, felt that they were
bringing dishonor upon themselves and their Master: And in the crowd there
were scribes who made the most of this opportunity to humiliate them.
Pressing around the disciples, they plied them with questions, seeking to
prove that they and their Master were deceivers. Here, the rabbis tri-
umphantly declared, was an evil spirit that neither the disciples nor Christ
Himself could conquer. The people were inclined to side with the scribes,
and a feeling of contempt and scorn pervaded the crowd.
   "But suddenly the accusations ceased. Jesus and the three disciples were
seen approaching, and with a quick revulsion of feeling the people turned to
meet them. The night of communion with the heavenly glory had left its
trace upon the Saviour and His companions. Upon their countenances was a
light that awed the beholders. The scribes drew back in fear, while the people
welcomed Jesus."—The Desire of Ages, page 427.

  5. Looking upon the unbelieving multitude, the caviling scribes,
and His perplexed disciples, what did the sorrowing Saviour say?
What request did He make? Mark 9:19.
                              [ 25
                   A Desperate Conflict
  6. When the son was brought to Jesus, what did the evil spirit
do? Mark 9:20.
   NOTE.—"Again the Prince of life and the prince of the powers of darkness
had met on the field of battle,—Christ in fulfillment of His mission to 'preach
deliverance to the captives, .. . to set at liberty them that are bruised,' Satan
seeking to hold his victim under his control. Angels of light and the hosts of
evil angels, unseen, were pressing near to behold the conflict. For a moment,
Jesus permitted the evil spirit to display his power, that the beholders might
comprehend the deliverance about to be wrought."—The Desire of Ages, page
428.
  7. What question did Jesus ask the distressed father? What
was his reply? What appeal for help did he make? Mark 9:21, 22.
8. How did Jesus endeavor to strengthen the faith of the father?
Mark 9:23.
   9. How did the father respond to the Saviour's invitation to exer-
cise greater faith? Mark 9:24.
                      Divine Power Revealed
  10. In the presence of the multitude, what twofold command did
Jesus issue to the evil spirit? Mark 9:25.
  11. What was the evil spirit compelled to do? In what condition
did he leave the boy? Mark 9:26.
   12. What more did Jesus do for the boy? How did this manifes-
tation of divine power affect the multitude? Mark 9:27; Luke 9:43,
first part.
   NoTE.—" 'If Thou canst do anything, have compassion on us, and help
us.' How many a sin-burdened soul has echoed that prayer. And to all, the
pitying Saviour's answer is, 'If thou canst believe, all things are possible to
him that believeth.' It is faith that connects us with heaven, and brings us
strength for coping with the powers of darkness. In Christ, God has provided
means for subduing every sinful trait, and resisting every temptation, however
strong. But many feel that they lack faith, and therefore they remain away
from Christ. Let these souls, in their helpless unworthiness, cast themselves
upon the mercy of their compassionate Saviour. . . . Then grasp His promise,
`Him that cometh to Me I will in nowise cast out.' Cast yourself at His feet
with the cry, 'Lord, I believe; help Thou mine unbelief.' You can never
perish while you do this—never."—The Desire of Ages, pages 428, 429.

                    The Trial of Faith
13. What power had Jesus previously given the twelve disciples?
Matt. 10:1.
  14. When alone with Jesus, what question did the nine disciples
ask Him? What was His answer? Matt. 17:19, 20, first clause.
                                       26 ]
   NoTE.—"The nine disciples were yet pondering upon the bitter fact of their
own failure. . . . Their unbelief, that shut them out from deeper sympathy
with Christ, and the carelessness with which they regarded the sacred work
committed to them, had caused their failure in the conflict with the powers
of darkness.
   "The words of Christ pointing to His death had brought sadness and
doubt. And the selection of the three disciples to accompany Jesus to the
mountain had excited the jealousy of the nine. Instead of strengthening their
faith by prayer and meditation on the words of Christ, they had been dwell-
ing on their discouragements and personal grievances. In this state of dark-
ness they had undertaken the conflict with Satan."—The Desire of Ages, page
430.
   15. What personal experience would have enabled these disci-
ples to have triumphed in this contest? Matt. 17:20, second part, 21.
   NoTE.—"In order to succeed in such a conflict they must come to the'work
in a different spirit. Their faith must be strengthened by fervent prayer and
fasting, and humiliation of heart. They must be emptied of self, and be filled
with the Spirit and power of God. Earnest, persevering supplication to God
in faith—faith that leads to entire dependence upon God, and unreserved
consecration to His work—can alone avail to bring men the Holy Spirit's aid
in the battle against principalities and powers, the rulers of the darkness of
this world, and wicked spirits in high places."—The Desire of Ages, page 430.

I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of My Father
which is in heaven." Matthew 18:10.
    STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pages 432-439.

            Decisive, Events at Jerusalem Foretold
  1. While Jesus and His disciples were on their way through
Galilee to Capernaum, what three future events did He reveal to
them? Matt. 17:22, 23.

   2. Though Jesus spoke plainly, what prevented the disciples
from understanding His words? Luke 9:45, 46.
   NOTE.—"Although the shadow of a great sorrow fell upon them, a spirit
of rivalry found a place in their hearts. They disputed among themselves
which should be accounted greatest in the kingdom. This strife they thought
to conceal from Jesus, and they did not, as usual, press close to His side, but
loitered behind, so that He was in advance of them as they entered Caper-
naum. Jesus read their thoughts, and He longed to counsel and instruct them.
But for this He awaited a quiet hour, when their hearts should be open to
receive His words."—The Desire of Ages, page 432.
                                      [27 ]
                              Paying Tribute
   3. As the disciples entered Capernaum, who came to Peter, and
what question did they ask? Matt. 17:24.
   NorE.—"This tribute was not a civil tax, but a religious contribution,
which every Jew was required to pay annually for the support of the temple.
A refusal to pay the tribute would be regarded as disloyalty to the temple,—
in the estimation of the rabbis a most grievous sin. The Saviour's attitude
toward the rabbinical laws, and His plain reproofs to the defenders of tradi-
tion, afforded a pretext for the charge that He was seeking to overthrow the
temple service. Now His enemies saw an opportunity of casting discredit
upon Him. In the collector of the tribute they found a ready ally."—The
Desire of Ages, pages 432, 433.

   4. What was Peter's hasty reply? When alone with His disciples,
what question did Jesus ask Peter? Matt. 17:25.
   NOTE.—"Peter saw in the collector's question an insinuation touching
Christ's loyalty to the temple. Zealous for his Master's honor, he hastily an-
swered, without consulting Him, that Jesus would pay the tribute.
   "But Peter only partially comprehended the purpose of his questioner.
There were some classes who were held to be exempt from the payment of the
tribute. . . . In the days of Christ the priests and Levites were still regarded
as especially devoted to the temple, and were not required to make the annual
contribution for its support. Prophets also were exempted from this pay-
ment. In requiring the tribute from Jesus, the rabbis were setting aside His
claim as a prophet or teacher, and were dealing with Him as with any com-
monplace person. A refusal on His part to pay the tribute would be repre-
sented as disloyalty to the temple; while, on the other hand, the payment of
it would be taken as justifying their rejection of Him as a prophet."—The
Desire of Ages, page 433.

  5. How did Peter reply to the inquiry of Jesus concerning cus-
tom or tribute? Who then are free? Matt. 17:26.

   6. To avoid needless offense, what instruction did Jesus give to
Peter? Matt. 17:27.
   NoTE.—"If Jesus had paid the tribute without a protest, He would vir-
tually have acknowledged the justice of the claim, and would thus have
denied His divinity. But while He saw good to meet the demand, He denied
the claim upon which it was based. In providing for the payment of the
tribute He gave evidence of His divine character. It was made manifest
that He was one with God, and therefore was not under tribute as a mere
subject of the kingdom."—The Desire of Ages, page 434.

              The Crowning Grace of Humility
7. What question was uppermost in the minds of the disciples?
Mark 9:33, 34; Matt. 18:1.

   8. In striving for supremacy, whose example does one follow?
Isa. 14:12-14.
                                28
   NOTE.—"The strife for the highest place was the outworking of that same
spirit which was the beginning of the great controversy in the world above,
and which had brought Christ from heaven to die. . . . Lucifer had said, 'I
will be like the Most High ;' and the desire for self-exaltation had brought
strife into the heavenly courts, and had banished a multitude of the hosts of
God."—The Desire of Ages, page 435.

   9. Whose example of unselfishness and humility should the dis-
ciple of Christ follow? Phil. 2:5-8.
   NOTE.—"Only when selfishness is dead, when strife for supremacy is ban-
ished, when gratitude fills the heart, and love makes fragrant the life,—it is
only then that Christ is abiding in the soul, and we are recognized as laborers
together with God."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 402.

   10. In answer to the question, "Who is the greatest in the king-
dom of heaven?" what did Jesus do? Matt. 18:2-4.
   NOTE.—"Before honor is humility. To fill a high place before men, Heaven
chooses the worker who, like John the Baptist, takes a lowly place before
God. The most childlike disciple is the most efficient in labor for God. The
heavenly intelligences can co-operate with him who is seeking, not to exalt
self, but to save souls. . . .
   "The simplicity, the self-forgetfulness, and the confiding love of a little
child are the attributes that Heaven values. These are the characteristics of
real greatness."—The Desire of Ages, pages 436, 437.

           The Grace of Kindness and the Seriousness
                          of Offense
   11. In Paul's ministry what course did he pursue? 1 Thess. 2:7, 8.

  12. What promise is made to those who, receive a little child in
Jesus' name? Mark 9:37.

   13. What then did John say to Jesus? What reply did Jesus
make? Mark 9:38-40.
   NOTE.—"None who showed themselves in any way friendly to Christ were
to be repulsed. There were many who had been deeply moved by the char-
acter and the work of Christ, and whose hearts were opening to Him in
faith ; and the disciples, who could not read motives, must be careful not to
discourage these souls. When Jesus was no longer personally among them,
and the work was left in their hands, they must not indulge a narrow, ex-
clusive spirit, but manifest the same far-reaching sympathy which they had
seen in their Master."—The Desire of Ages, pages 437, 438.

  14. What promise is given to one who renders the smallest
service to one of Christ's little ones? What does Jesus say of the
individual who offends such a one? Mark 9:41, 42.
  NOTE.—"Any kibit or practice that would lead into sin, and bring dis-
honor upon Christ, would better be put away, whatever the sacrifice. That
                                  [ 29 ]
which dishonors God cannot benefit the soul. The blessing of heaven cannot
attend any man in violating the eternal principles of right. And one sin
cherished is sufficient to work the degradation of the character, and to mis-
lead others. If the foot or the hand would be cut off, or even the eye would
be plucked out, to save the body from death, how much more earnest should
we be to put away sin, that brings death to the soul."—The Desire of Ages,
page 439.

   1. What element did Jesus say should be mingled with every
sacrifice? What two things did He say His disciples should have?
Mark 9:49, 50.
   NOTE.—"In the ritual service, salt was added to every sacrifice. This, like
the offering of incense, signified that only the righteousness of Christ could
make the service acceptable to God. . . . All who would present themselves
`a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,' must receive the saving salt,
the righteousness of our Saviour. Then they become 'the salt of the earth,'
restraining evil among men, as salt preserves from corruption. But if the salt
has lost its savor; if there is only a profession of godliness, without the love
of Christ, there is no power for good. The life can exert no saving influence
upon the world."—The Desire of Ages, page 439.

   2. What tender care and constant protection is assured to every
humble, contrite follower of Christ? Matt. 18:10; Ps. 34:7.
   NOTE.—"A guardian angel is appointed to every follower of Christ. These
heavenly watchers shield the righteous from the power of the wicked one....
The angels appointed to minister to the children of God have at all times
access to His presence."—The Great Controversy, pages 512, 513.

             The Unfailing Love of the Good Shepherd
  3. How does Jesus illustrate His great love for one of these little
ones who has gone astray? Matt. 18:12.

  4. If the straying one is found, what is done? What is not the
will of our heavenly Father? Matt. 18:13, 14.
  NOTE.—" 'We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the
weak, and not to please ourselves.' No soul who believes in Christ, though
                                        [ 80 I
his faith may be weak, and his steps wavering as those of a little child, is to
be lightly esteemed. By all that has given us advantage over another,—be it
education and refinement, nobility of character, Christian training, religious
experience,—we are in debt to those less favored; and, so far as lies in our
power, we are to minister unto them. If we are strong, we are to stay up
the hands of the weak. Angels of glory, that do always behold the face of
the Father in heaven, joy in ministering to His little ones. Trembling souls,
who have many objectionable traits of character, are their special charge.
Angels are ever present where they are most needed, with those who have
the hardest battle with self to fight, and whose surroundings are the most
discouraging. And in this ministry Christ's true followers will co-operate."—
The Desire of Ages, page 440.

   5. If a brother shall trespass against us, what specific instruction
did Jesus give concerning our duty? What is the result if he shall
hear us? Matt. 18:15. See Lev. 19:17, margin; also Prov. 25:8, 9.
   NOTE.—"All heaven is interested in the interview between the one who has
been injured and the one who is in error. As the erring one accepts the re-
proof offered in the love of Christ, and acknowledges his wrong, asking for-
giveness from God and from his brother, the sunshine of heaven fills his
heart. The controversy is ended; friendship and confidence are restored. The
oil of love removes the soreness caused by the wrong."—Testimonies, vol. 7,
p. 261.
   6. If our first effort toward reconciliation fails, what should we
then do? Matt. 18:16.
   NOTE.—"Take with you those who are spiritually minded, and talk with
the one in error in regard to the wrong. He may yield to the united appeals
of his brethren. As he sees their agreement in the matter, his mind may be
enlightened."—Testimonies, vol. 7, p. 262.

                              Love in Action
   7. Under what circumstances should appeal be made to the
church? If he will not hear the church, what should be done?
Matt. 18:17.
   NOTE.—"If the erring one repents and submits to Christ's discipline, he is
to be given another trial. And even if he does not repent, even if he stands
outside the church, God's servants still have a work to do for him. They are
to seek earnestly to win him to repentance. And, however aggravated may
have been his offense, if he yields to the striving of the Holy Spirit, and, by
confessing and forsaking his sin, gives evidence of repentance, he is to be
forgiven and welcomed to the fold again. His brethren are to encourage him
in the right way, treating him as they would wish to be treated were they
in his place, considering themselves, lest they also be tempted."—Testimonies,
vol. 7, p. 263.

   8. If we faithfully follow Christ's instruction, what will be done
in heaven? Matt. 18:18.
   NOTE.—"This statement holds its force in all ages. On the church has been
conferred the power to act in Christ's stead. It is God's instrumentality for
                                      31 ]
the preservation of order and discipline among His people.- To it the Lord has
delegated the power to settle all questions respecting its prosperity, purity,
and order. Upon it rests the responsibility of excluding from its fellowship
those who are unworthy, who by their unchristlike conduct would bring dis-
honor on the truth. Whatever the church does that is in accordance with the
directions given in God's word will be ratified in heaven."—Testimonies, vol.
7, p. 263.

   9. What exceedingly precious promise is made to two or more
who are agreed? Whose gracious presence is with those who meet
together in the name of Jesus? Matt. 18:19, 20.
   NoTE.—"Wherever His word is obeyed with a sincere heart, there Christ
abides. Not only is He present in the assemblies of the church, but wherever
disciples, however few, meet in His name, there also He will be."—The Desire
of Ages, page 442.
                      The Measure of Forgiveness
    10. What did Peter ask Jesus concerning forgiveness? What
was the Saviour's reply? Matt. 18:21, 22; Luke 17:3, 4.
    NOTE.—"The rabbis limited the exercise of forgiveness to three offenses.
Peter, carrying out, as he supposed, the teaching of Christ, thought to extend
it to seven, the number signifying perfection. But Christ taught that we are
never to become weary of forgiving."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 243.

   11. To what did Jesus liken the kingdom of heaven? In what
condition was the account of one of the king's servants? Matt.
18:23, 24.
   NoTE.—"He [Christ] showed the true ground upon which forgiveness is
to be granted, and the danger of cherishing an unforgiving spirit."—Christ's
Object Lessons, page 243.

   12. Since the debtor could not pay, what did the king command?
What did the servant then do and say? What did this appeal cause
the king to do? Matt. 18:25-27.
   NOTE.—"The pardon granted by this king represents a divine forgiveness
of all sin. Christ is represented by the king, who, moved with compassion,
forgave the debt of his servant. Man was under the condemnation of the
broken law. He could not save himself, and for this reason Christ came to
this world, clothed His divinity with humanity, and gave His life, the just
for the unjust. He gave Himself for our sins, and to every soul He freely
offers the blood-bought pardon. 'With the Lord there is mercy, and with
Him is plenteous redemption.' "—Christ's Object Lessons, pages 244, 245.

                            Justice and Mercy
   13. How was this experience repeated? In what respect did it
differ from the first? Matt. 18:28-30.
   NOTE.—"So there are many who hope by their own works to merit God's
favor. They do not realize their helplessness. They do not accept the grace
of God as a free gift, but are trying to build themselves up in self-righteous-
                                      [ 32
ness. Their own hearts are not broken and humbled on account of sin, and
they are• exacting and unforgiving toward others. Their own sins against
God, compared with their brother's sins against them, are as ten thousand
talents to one hundred pence,—nearly one million to one; yet they dare to be
unforgiving."—Christ's Object Lessons, pages 245-247.

   14. How did the king learn all that had occurred? What fol-
lowed as a consequence of the unforgiving spirit of the first serv-
ant? Matt. 18:31-34.
   NOTE.—"He who refuses to forgive, is thereby casting away his own hope
of pardon. But the teaching of this parable should not be misapplied. God's
forgiveness toward us lessens in nowise our duty to obey Him. So the spirit
of forgiveness toward our fellow men does not lessen the daim of just obli-
gation. . . .
   "Our Lord teaches that matters of difficulty between Christians are to be
settled within the church. They should not be opened before those who do
not fear God. If a Christian is wronged by his brother, let him not appeal
to unbelievers in a court of justice. Let him follow out the instruction Christ
has given."—Christ's Object Lessons, pages 247-249.

   15. What lesson does our Lord design we should learn from this
parable? Matt. 18:35.
   NorE.—"But the great lesson of the parable lies in the contrast between
God's compassion and man's hardheartedness; in the fact that God's forgiv-
ing mercy is to be the measure of our own.          '
   "Nothing can justify an unforgiving spirit. He who is unmerciful toward
others shows that he himself is not a partaker of God's pardoning grace.
In God's forgiveness the heart of the erring one is drawn close to the great
heart of Infinite Love. The tide of divine compassion flows into the sinner's
soul, and from him to the souls of others. The tenderness and mercy that
Christ has revealed in His own precious life will 'be seen in those who become
sharers of His grace."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 251.


                  Lesson 12, for December 21, 1946
                     The Feast of Tabernacles
    LESSON SCRIPTURE: John 7:2 to 8:11.
    MEMORY VERSE: "In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood
and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto Me, and drink. He that be-
lieveth on Me, as the scripture bath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living
water." John 7:37, 38.
    STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pages 447-462.

                       The Journey to Jerusalem
   1. As the Feast of Tabernacles was close at hand, what did the
brothers of Jesus urge Him to do? What twofold reason did they
give for this request? John 7:2-5.
   NoTE.—"It was a false conception of the Messiah's work, and a lack of
faith in the divine character of Jesus, that had led His brothers to urge Him
                                        [ 33 ]
to present Himself publicly to the people at the Feast of Tabernacles. Now,
in a spirit akin to this, the disciples would have prevented Him from making
the journey to Jerusalem. They remembered His words concerning what
was to befall Him there, they knew the deadly hostility of the religious
leaders, and they would fain have dissuaded their Master from going thither."
—The Desire of Ages, page 486.

   2. What reply did Jesus make? What reason did He give for
not at once responding to their request? What did He do? John
7:6-9.

   3. When His brethren had departed, what did Jesus do? How
did He do it? John 7:10.
   NoTE.—"Meanwhile Jesus had quietly arrived at Jerusalem. He had chosen
an unfrequented route by which to go, in order to avoid the travelers who
were making their way to the city from all quarters. Had He joined any of
the caravans that went up to the feast, public attention would have been at-
traded to Him on His entrance into the city, and a popular demonstration
in His favor would have aroused the authorities against Him. It was to
avoid this that He chose to make the journey alone."—The Desire of Ages,
pages 451, 452.
                    Amid Perils and Snares
   4. What confused condition prevailed among the people at Jeru-
salem, and why? John 7:11-13.

    5. In the midst of the feast, what did Jesus do? How were the
Jews affected? What did they say? How did He answer them?
John 7:14-16.
   NOTE.—"No one was regarded as qualified to be a religious teacher unless
he had studied in the rabbinical schools, and both Jesus and John the Baptist
had been represented as ignorant because they had not received this training.
Those who heard them were astonished at their knowledge of the Scriptures,
`having never learned.' Of men they had not, truly; but the God of heaven
was their teacher, and from Him they had received the highest kind of
wisdom.
   "As Jesus spoke in the temple court, the people were held spellbound. The
very men who were the most violent against Him felt themselves powerless
to do Him harm. For the time, all other interests were forgotten."—The
Desire of Ages, page 453.

  6. How may we know the truth? John 7:17, 18.

  7. Though priests and rulers were watching constantly to entrap
Jesus and to kill Him, why could they not accomplish their evil
purpose? John 7:30.

  8. What did many of the people do and say? John 7:31, 40, 41.
                             84
                     The Great Day of the Feast
   9. On the last day of the feast what appeal did Jesus make to the
people? To the believer what will be the result? John 7:37, 38;
Isa. 44:3, 4; John 4:14.
   NOTE.—"The priest had that morning performed the ceremony which com-
memorated the smiting of the rock in the wilderness. That rock was a symbol
of Him who by His death would cause living streams of salvation to flow to
all who are athirst. Christ's words were the water of life. There in the pres-
ence of the assembled multitude He set Himself apart to be smitten, that the
water of life might flow to the world. In smiting Christ, Satan thought to
destroy the Prince of life; but from the smitten rock there flowed living
water."—The Desire of Ages, page 454.
  10. In the words, "living water," of what did Jesus speak? Why
could not that blessed experience come to the believer on that day?
John 7:39.

                "Never Man Spake Like This Man"
   11. What did the priests and Pharisees say to the officers whom
they had sent to take Jesus? What did the officers say? What ques-
tions did the Pharisees then ask? John 7:45-48.
   NorE.—"Hardened as were their hearts, they were melted by His words.
While He was speaking in the temple court, they had lingered near, to catch
something that might be turned against Him. But as they listened, the pur-
pose for which they had been sent was forgotten. They stood as men en-
tranced. Christ revealed Himself to their souls. They saw.that which priests
and rulers would not see,—humanity flooded with the glory of divinity. They
returned, so filled with this thought, so impressed by His words, that to the
inquiry, 'Why have ye not brought Him?' they could only reply, 'Never man
spake like this Man.' "—The Desire of Ages, page 459.

   12. While the Jews were still plotting the destruction of Jesus,
who came to His rescue? What question did Nicodemus ask? What
reply did the Jews make? Where did they go? John 7:50-53; 8:1.
   NOTE.—"Silence fell on the assembly. The words of Nicodemus came
home to their consciences. They could not condemn a man unheard. But it
was not for this reason alone that the haughty rulers remained silent, gazing
at him who had dared to speak in favor of justice. They were startled and
chagrined that one of their own number had been so far impressed by the
character of Jesus as to speak a word in His defense. . . .
   "Yet the protest resulted in staying the proceedings of the council. The
rulers were unable to carry out their purpose and condemn Jesus without a
hearing. Defeated for the time, 'every man went unto his own house. Jesus
went unto the Mount of Olives.'"—The Desire of Ages, page 460.

         Divine Justice, Love, and Compassion Revealed
  13. Early the next morning, while Jesus was teaching in the
temple, what plot for His ruin was unveiled? John 8:2-6, first part.
                                    [ 85 ]
   14. While the scribes and Pharisees were waiting for His de-
cision, what did Jesus do? While they urged the matter upon Him,
what did He say to them? John 8:6, 7.
   15. How were the accusers affected by what Jesus wrote on the
ground? What did they then do? John 8:8, 9. '
   NoTE.—"Impatient at His delay and apparent indifference, the accusers
drew nearer, urging the matter upon His attention. But as their eyes, follow-
ing those of Jesus, fell upon the pavement at His feet, their countenances
changed. There, traced before them, were the guilty secrets of their own lives.
The people looking on, saw the sudden change of expression, and pressed
forward to discover what it was that they were regarding with such astonish-
ment and shame.. .
   "He had not set aside the law given through Moses, nor infringed upon
the authority of Rome. The accusers had been defeated. Now, their robe
of pretended holiness torn from them, they stood, guilty and condemned, in
the presence of Infinite Purity. They trembled lest the hidden iniquity of
their lives should be laid open to the multitude; and one by one, with bowed
heads and downcast eyes, they stole away, leaving their victim with the pity-
ing Saviour."—The Desire of Ages, page 461.
   16. When the woman was left alone with Jesus, what conversa-
tion followed? John 8:10, 11.
   NoTE.—"In His act of pardoning this woman and encouraging her to live
a better life, the character of Jesus shines forth in the beauty of perfect right-
eousness. While He does not palliate sin, nor lessen the sense of guilt, He
seeks not to condemn, but to save. The world had for this erring woman only
contempt and scorn; but Jesus speaks words of comfort and hope. The Sinless
One pities the weakness of the sinner, and reaches to her a helping hand.
While the hypocritical Pharisees denounce, Jesus bids her, 'Go, and sin no
more.'
   "It is not Christ's follower that, with averted eyes, turns from the erring,
leaving them unhindered to pursue their downward course. Those who are
forward in accusing others, and zealous in bringing them to justice, are often
in their own lives more guilty than they. Men hate the sinner, while they
love the sin. Christ hates the sin, but loves the sinner. This will be the spirit
of all who follow Him. Christian love is slow to censure, quick to discern
penitence, ready to forgive, to encourage, to set the wanderer in the path of
holiness, and to stay his feet therein."—The Desire of Ages, page 462.

                   Lesson 13, for December 28, 1946
              The Light and Life of the World
    LESSON SCRIPTURES: John 8:12, 29-59; Matthew 11:25-30; John 1:4, 9.
    MEMORY VERSE: "Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light
of the world: he that followeth Me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light
of life." John 8:12.
    STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pages 463-470, 328, 329.
                       The Light of Men
  1. In speaking of Himself, what did Jesus say? What did He say
of those who follow Him? John 8:12.
                                          36
   2. What did Isaiah, who prophesied more than seven hundred
years before Christ, say of Jesus? What did Simeon in the temple
say of Him? Isa. 49:6; Luke 2:32.
   NOTE.—"This prophecy [Isaiah 49:6] was generally understood as spoken
of the Messiah, and when Jesus said, 'I am the light of the world,' the people
could not fail to recognize His claim to be the Promised One."—The Desire
of Ages, page 465.

   3. Upon how many does the Light shine? John 1:4, 9.
   NOTE.—"Even among the heathen are those who have cherished the spirit
of kindness; before the words of life had fallen upon their ears, they have
befriended the missionaries, even ministering to them at the peril of their own
lives. Among the heathen are those who worship'God ignorantly, those to
whom the light is never brought by human instrumentality, yet they will not
perish. Though ignorant of the written law of God, they have heard His
voice speaking to them in nature, and have done the things that the law re-
quired. Their works are evidence that the Holy Spirit has touched their
hearts, and they are recognized as the children of God."—The Desire of
Ages, page 638.

       Jesus and His Father; the Jews and Their Father
  4. Who did Jesus say was with Him? What reason did He give
for this companionship? What result followed His teaching? John
8:29, 30.
  5. Why did the Jews not believe in Jesus? What did Jesus say
would be the result of their unbelief? John 8:23, 24, 45.

   6. What did Jesus say to those who believed on Him? What
experience would come to them? John 8:31, 32, 36; Rom. 8:1, 2.
   NorE.—"In the work of redemption there is no compulsion. No external
force is employed. Under the influence of the Spirit of God, man is left free
to choose whom he will serve. In the change that takes place when the soul
surrenders to Christ, there is the highest sense of freedom. The expulsion of
sin is the act of the soul itself. True, we have no power to free ourselves from
Satan's control; but when we desire to be set free from sin, and in our great
need cry out for a power out of and above ourselves, the powers of the soul
are imbued with the divine energy of the Holy Spirit, and they obey the
dictates of the will in fulfilling the will of God."—The Desire of Ages, page
466.
   7. Who did the Jews say was their father? Whose children did
Jesus say they were? John 8:39-41, 44.
   NOTE.—"In plotting against Christ, the rabbis were not doing the works of
Abraham. A mere lineal descent from Abraham was of no value. Without a
spiritual connection with him, which would be manifested in possessing the
same spirit, and doing the same works, they were not his children.
   "This principle bears with equal weight upon a question that has long agi-
tated the Christian world,—the question of apostolic succession. Descent from
Abraham was proved, not by name and lineage, but by likeness of character.
                                     (37]
So the apostolic succession rests not upon the transmission of ecclesiastical
authority, but upon spiritual relationship. A life actuated by the apostles'
spirit, the belief and teaching of the truth they taught, this is the true evi-
dence of apostolic succession. This is what constitutes men the successors of
the first teachers of the gospel."—The Desire of Ages, page 467.

                    The Sinless, Self-Existent One
    8. What challenge did Jesus make to the Jews? John 8:46.
    NorE.—The Revised Version reads: "Which of you convicteth Me of sin?"
   "Could one sin have been found in Christ, had He in one particular yielded
to Satan to escape the terrible torture, the enemy of God and man would have
triumphed."—The Desire of Ages, page 761.

    9. After drawing a sharp contrast between the position of the
Jews and that of Abraham, what did Jesus say Abraham rejoiced
to see? What reply did the Jews make? John 8:56, 57.
    NOTE.—"Abraham had greatly desired to see the promised Saviour. He
offered up the most earnest prayer that before his death he might behold the
Messiah. And he saw Christ. A supernatural light was given him, and he
acknowledged Christ's divine character. He saw His day, and was glad. He
was given a view of the divine sacrifice for sin. Of this sacrifice he had an
illustration in his own experience. The command came to him, 'Take now thy
son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, . . . and offer him . . . for a
burnt offering' Upon the altar of sacrifice he laid the son of promise, the son
in whom his hopes were centered. . . . This terrible ordeal was imposed upon
Abraham that he might see the day of Christ, and realize the great love of
God for the world, so great that to raise it from its degradation, He gave His
only-begotten Son to a most shameful death."—The Desire of Ages, pages
468, 469.

   10. How then did Jesus plainly declare His relationship to God?
What did His enemies attempt to do? Why were they restrained
from accomplishing their evil purpose? John 8:58, 59, 20.
   NOTE.—"With solemn dignity Jesus answered, 'Verily, verily, I say unto
you, Before Abraham was, I AM.' Silence fell upon the vast assembly. The
name of God, given to Moses to express the idea of the eternal presence, had
been claimed as His own by this Galilean Rabbi. He had announced Himself
to be the self-existent One, He who had been promised to Israel, 'whose
goings forth have been from of old, from the days of eternity.' "—The Desire
of Ages, pages 469, 470.
                         A Gracious Invitation
   11. From whom is the good news of salvation hidden? To whom
is it revealed? Matt. 11:25.
   NOTE.—"The Saviour rejoiced that the plan of salvation is such that those
who are wise in their own estimation, who are puffed up by the teachings of
vain philosophy, cannot see the beauty, power, and hidden mystery of the
gospel. But to all those who are of a humble heart, who have a teachable,
honest, childlike desire to know and do the will of their heavenly Father,
                                    [ 38 ]
His word is revealed as the power of God to their salvation. The operation
of the Spirit of God is foolishness to the unrenewed man."—Testimonies, vol.
4, p. 586.
  12. Why is it hidden from anyone? 2 Cor. 4:3, 4.
  13. What did Jesus say that reveals His perfect unity with His
Father? Matt. 11:26, 27.
  14. What blessed invitation did Jesus extend to the weary and
care-laden? What will He give to all who accept Him? Matt. 11:28.
  NOTE.—"In these words Christ is speaking to every human being. Whether
they know it or not, all are weary and heavy-laden. All are weighed down
with burdens that only Christ can remove. The heaviest burden that we
bear is the burden of sin. If we were left to bear this burden, it would crush
us. But the Sinless One has taken our place. 'The Lord hath laid on Him the
iniquity of us all.' He has borne the burden of our guilt. He will take the
load from our weary shoulders. He will give us rest. The burden of care
and sorrow also He will bear. He invites us to cast all our care upon Him;
for He carries us upon His heart."—The Desire of Ages, pages 328, 329.

  15. What are we to take in obedience to His invitation, and what
shall we find? Matt. 11:29, 30.
   NoTE.—" 'Take My yoke upon you,' Jesus says. The yoke is an instru-
ment of service. . . . We are to take upon us His yoke, that we may be co-
workers with Him.
   "The yoke that binds to service is the law of God. The great law of love
revealed in Eden, proclaimed upon Sinai, and in the new covenant written
in the heart, is that which binds the human worker to the will of God. If we
were left to follow our own inclinations, to go just where our will would
lead us, we should fall into Satan's ranks and become possessors of his attri-
butes. Therefore God confines us to His will, which is high, and noble, and
elevating."—The Desire of Ages, page 329.

    FAR EASTERN

          DIVISION




             THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
              Far Eastern Division — December 28
SEVEN  long war-weary years have passed since our latest Thirteenth Sab-
  bath Offering overflow was dedicated to the Far Eastern Division. It
amounted to $7,742.63, and gave encouragement to the brethren and strength
to the work. In the intervening years our institutions, churches, and the
homes of our people have suffered from war's awful scourge. Publishing
houses, colleges and academies, and church buildings have been destroyed, or
so greatly damaged as to be unusable. In the Philippines alone 116 of our
churches were destroyed, together with the sanitarium, publishing house, and
three academies. Notwithstanding war's horrors and hindrances eight thou-
sand persons were baptized in this division during the war years.
    The needs are vast and urgent. Calls multiply for workers. Money, much
money, is needed to restore all lines of work and press on into fruitful fields
of evangelism. Two hundred and thirty-five million people must hear the
"good news." And thirty-six thousand Seventh-day Adventists throughout the
division are sacrificing with us to hasten the finishing of the task. The "over-
flow" offering on December 28 should be the largest we have ever given, and
it will be if every member will double what he has given in the past.
