     THE LIFE AND TEACHINGS OF JESUS


                       Lesson 1, for July 6, 1946
            Sincerity and Simplicity in Service
                       and Devotion
  LESSON SCRIPTURES: Matthew 6:1-8, 16-18; Isaiah 58:6-11.
  MEMORY VERSE: "But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and
when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father
which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly." Matt. 6:6.
  STUDY HELP: "Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing," pages 119-130.

          The True Motive in Service; in Almsgiving
   1. In the performance of good deeds, what motive should al-
ways be avoided? What result will follow a failure to heed this
counsel? Matt. 6:1.


    2. Of what is publicity in almsgiving a sign? What is the re-
ward for such giving? Matt. 6:2.
   NorE.—"In the days of Christ the Pharisees were continually trying to
earn the favor of Heaven, in order to secure the worldly honor and prosperity
which they regarded as the reward of virtue. At the same time they paraded
their acts of charity before the people in order to attract their attention, and
gain a reputation for sanctity.
   "Jesus rebuked their ostentation, declaring that God does not recognize
such service, and that the flattery and admiration of the people, which they
so eagerly sought, was the only reward they would ever receive."—Thoughts
From the Mount of Blessing, page 120.


    3. How does the Lord illustrate the right way of giving? What
promise is made to those who follow this course? Mact. 6:3, 4;
Mark 9:41.
   NOTE.—"Sincerity of purpose, real kindness of heart, is the motive that
Heaven values." "The work of beneficence is twice blessed. While he that
gives to the needy blesses others, he himself is blessed in a still greater degree.
The grace of Christ in the soul is developing traits of character that are the
opposite of selfishness,—traits that will refine, ennoble, and enrich the life.
Acts of kindness performed in secret will bind hearts together, and will draw
them closer to the heart of Him from whom every generous impulse springs.
                                      [3]
The little attentions, the small acts of love and self-sacrifice, that flow out
from the life as quietly as the fragrance from a flower,—these constitute no
small share of the blessings and happiness of life. And it will be found at last
that the denial of self for the good and happiness of others, however humble
and uncommended here, is recognized in heaven as the token of our union
with Him, the King of glory, who was rich, yet for our sake became poor."—
Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, pages 121, 123.

                          In Prayer
    4. When engaged in prayer, what are we to avoid? Matt. 6:5.

     5. How is the true child of God to pray? What assurance have
we that such prayers will be answered? Matt. 6:6.
    NOTE.—"Have a place for secret prayer. Jesus had select places for com-
munion with God, and so should we.... In the secret place of prayer, where
no eye but God's can see, no ear but His can hear, we may pour out our most
hidden desires and longings to the Father of infinite pity; and in the hush and
silence of the soul, that voice which never fails to answer the cry of human
need, will speak to our hearts."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing,
pages 125, 126.


      6. What is the purpose of prayer? Heb. 4:15, 16.
     NOTE.—"The darkness of the evil one encloses those who neglect to pray.
. . . Without unceasing prayer and diligent watching, we are in danger of
growing careless and of deviating from the right path. The adversary seeks
continually to obstruct the way to the mercy seat, that we may not by earnest
supplication and faith obtain grace and power to resist temptation."—Steps
to Christ, pages 98, 99.


     7. What further admonition is given regarding prayer? Matt.
6:7.
    NOTE.—"Prayer is not an expiation for sin; it has no virtue or merit of
itself. All the flowery words at our command are not equivalent to one holy
desire. The most eloquent prayers are but idle words if they do not express
the true sentiments of the heart. But the prayer that comes from an earnest
heart, when the simple wants of the soul are expressed, as we would ask an
earthly friend for a favor, expecting it to be granted—this is the prayer of
faith. God does not desire our ceremonial compliments; but the unspoken
cry of the heart broken and subdued with a sense of its sin and utter weak-
ness, finds its way to the Father of all mercy."—Thoughts From the Mount
of Blessing, pages 129, 130.


      8. With what is our heavenly Father acquainted? Matt. 6:8.
    NOTE.—"Prayer is the opening of the heart to God as to a friend. Not that
it is necessary, in order to make known to God what we are, but in order to
enable us to receive Him. Prayer does not bring God down to us, but brings
us up to Him."—Steps to Christ, page 97.
                                     [4]
                              In Fasting
     9. What instruction is given concerning fasting? Matt. 6:16-18.

    10. Describe the fast that God has chosen? Isa. 58:6, 7.
    NOTE.—"The fasting which the word of God enjoins is something more
 than a form. It does not consist merely in refusing food, in wearing sack-
 cloth, in sprinkling ashes upon the head. He who fasts in real sorrow for sin,
 will never court display.
    "The object of the fast which - God calls upon us to keep, is not to afflict
 the body for the sin of the soul, but to aid us in perceiving the grievous char-
 acter of sin, in humbling the heart before God, and receiving His pardoning
 grace. His command to Israel was, 'Rend your heart, and not your garments,
 and turn unto the Lord your God.'"—Thotights From the Mount of Blessing,
 page 131.

    11. What blessed results will follow such a fast? Isa. 58:8.
     NOTE.—"Doing good is an excellent remedy for disease. Those who engage
 in the work are invited to call upon God, and He has pledged Himself to
 answer them. Their soul shall be satisfied in drought, and they shall be like
 a watered garden, whose waters fail not."—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 29.


    12. Mention at least two notable instances when, as the result of
• fasting, great victories were gained. Esther 4:16; 8:16, 17; Matt.
  4:1, 2, 11.
     Nom—Read carefully Esther, chapters 3-10; also Matthew 4:1-11.


     13. What assurance is given regarding our prayers when the
  true fast is observed? Isa. 58:9, 10.


     14. What further assurance have we of divine guidance, protec-
  tion, and soul enrichment? Isa. 58:11.
     NOTE.—"If the Saviour of men, with His divine strength, felt the need of
  prayer, how much more should feeble, sinful mortals feel the necessity of
  prayer,—fervent, constant prayer! When Christ was the most fiercely beset
  by temptation, He ate nothing. He committed Himself to God, and through
  earnest prayer, and perfect submission to the will of His Father, came off con-
  queror. Those who profess the truth for these last days, above every other
  class of professed Christians, should imitate the great Exemplar in prayer."—
  Testimonies, vol. 2, pp. 202, 203.
   ' "Take time to read the Bible—the Book of books. A daily study of the
  Scriptures has a sanctifying, uplifting influence upon the mind. Bind the Holy
  Volume to your hearts. It will prove to you a friend and guide in perplexity."
  —Counsels to Teachers, pages 138, 139.

                      Lesson 2, for July 13, 1946

                    Prayer and Daily Living
    LESSON SCRIPTURE: Matthew 6:9-15.
    MEMORY VERSE: "But my God shall supply all your need according to His
riches in glory by Christ Jesus." Phil. 4:19.
   STUDY HELP: "Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing," pages 151-176.


                   The Lord's Prayer—The Name
     1. Where was the Lord's Prayer first given? Why was it later
repeated? Matt. 5:1, 2; 6:9; Luke 11:1.
    NoTE.—"The Lord's Prayer was twice given by our Saviour, first to the
multitude in the Sermon on the Mount, and again, some months later, to the
disciples alone. The disciples had been for a short time absent from their
Lord, when on their return they found Him absorbed in communion with
God. Seeming unconscious of their presence, He continued praying aloud.
The Saviour's face was irradiated with a celestial brightness. He seemed to
be in the very presence of the Unseen; and there was a living power in His
words, as of one who spoke with God.. . . The disciples had come to connect
His hours of prayer with the power of His words and works. Now, as they
listened to His supplication, their hearts were awed and humbled. As He
ceased praying, it was with a conviction of their own deep need that they
exclaimed, 'Lord, teach us to pray.' . . . The Saviour does not, however, re-
strict us to the use of these exact words."—Thoughts From the Mount of
Blessing, pages 151, 152.


     2. With what form of address does this prayer open? Matt. 6:9,
first part.
    NoTE.—"The infinite God, said Jesus, makes it your privilege to approach
Him by the name of Father. Understand all that this implies. No earthly
parent ever pleaded so earnestly with an erring child as He who made you
pleads with the transgressor. No human, loving interest ever followed the
impenitent with such tender invitations. God dwells in every abode; He hears
every word that is spoken, listens to every prayer that is offered, tastes the
sorrows and disappointments of every soul, regards the treatment that is
given to father, mother, sister, friend, and neighbor. He cares for our neces-
sities, and His love and mercy and grace are continually flowing to satisfy
our need."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, pages 155, 156.


    3. How are we to treat the name of the Lord? How should we
take that holy name upon our lips? Matt. 6:9, last part.
   Non.—"To hallow the name of the Lord requires that the words in which
we speak of the Supreme Being be uttered with reverence. 'Holy and reverend
is His name.' We are never in any manner to treat lightly the titles or ap-
pellations of the Deity. In prayer we enter the audience chamber of the Most
High; and we should come before Him with holy awe. The angels veil their
                                    [6]
faces in His presence. The cherubim and the bright and holy seraphim ap-
proach His throne with solemn reverence. How much more should we, finite,
sinful beings, come in a reverent manner before the Lord, our Maker! . . .
   "You cannot hallow His name, you cannot represent Him to the world,
unless in life and character you represent the very life and character of God.
This you can do only through the acceptance of the grace and righteousness
of Christ."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, pages 157, 158.

                 The Kingdom and the Will of God
    4. For what did Jesus further teach us to pray? What should be
our attitude toward the coming of the kingdom of God? Matt. 6:10,
first part; 2 Peter 3:12, margin.
   NorE.—"His kingdom will not come until the good tidings of His grace
have been carried to all the earth. Hence, as we give ourselves to God, and
win other souls to Him, we hasten the coming of His kingdom."—Thoughts
From the Mount of Blessing, page 160.


     5. Where is God's will to be done, and how? Where do we find
the will of God expressed in words, and perfectly in life? Matt.
6:10, last part; Ps. 40:7, 8.
    NOTE.—"The will of God is expressed in the precepts of His holy law, and
the principles of this law are the principles of heaven. The angels of heaven
attain unto no higher knowledge than to know the will of God; and to do
His will is the highest service that can engage their powers."—Thoughts From
the Mount of Blessing, page 161.
    "The first half of the prayer Jesus has taught us, is in regard to the name
and kingdom and will of God,—that His name may be honored, His kingdom
established, His will performed. When you have thus made God's service
your first interest, you may ask with confidence that your own needs may be
supplied."—Ibid., page 162.

                          All Things Are Yours
    6. For what are we daily dependent upon God? How fully will
God supply our needs? Matt. 6:11; Phil. 4:19.
   NorE.—"The prayer for daily bread indudes not only food to sustain the
body, but that spiritual bread which will nourish the soul into life everlasting.
Jesus bids us, 'Labor not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat
which endureth unto everlasting life.' He says, 'I am the living bread which
came down from heaven; if any man eat of this bread, he shall live forever.' "
—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, page 164.


     7. Having sought help for our physical needs, for what are we
next taught to ask? Luke 11:4, first part.
   NorE.—"God's forgiveness is not merely a judicial act by which He sets
us free from condemnation. It is not only forgiveness for sin, but reclaiming
from sin. It is the outflow of redeeming love that transforms the heart."—
Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, page 167.
                                    f
     8. Upon what condition will this wonderful promise be ful-
filled? Matt. 6:14, 15; 1 John 1:9.
   NOTE.—"He who is unforgiving, cuts off the very channel through which
alone he can receive mercy from God. We should not think that unless those
who have injured us confess the wrong, we are justified in withholding from
them our forgiveness. It is their part, no doubt, to humble their hearts by
repentance and confession; but we are to have a spirit of compassion toward
those who have trespassed against us, whether or not they confess their faults.
However sorely they may have wounded us, we are not to cherish our griev-
ances, and sympathize with ourselves over our injuries; but as we hope to be
pardoned for our offenses against God, we are to pardon all who have done
evil to us."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, page 166.



   9. What should be the specific character of true confession? Ps.
51:1-4, 10.
   NOTE.—"True confession is always of a specific character, and acknowl-
edges particular sins. They may be of such a nature as to be brought before
God only; they may be wrongs that should be confessed to individuals who
have suffered injury through them; or they may be of a public character,
and should then be as publicly confessed. But all confession should be definite
and to the point, acknowledging the very sins of which you are guilty."—
Steps to Christ, page 43.



   10. How may this blessed state of freedom from sin be main-
tained? 1 John 1:7.
    NOTE.—"Consecrate yourself to God in the morning; make this your very
first work. Let your prayer be, 'Take me, 0 Lord, as wholly Thine. I lay all
my plans at Thy feet. Use me today in Thy service. Abide with me, and let
all my work be wrought in Thee.' This is a daily matter. Each morning con-
secrate yourself to God for that day. Surrender all your plans to Him, to be
carried out or given up as His providence shall indicate. Thus day by day you
may be giving your life into the hands of God, and thus your life will be
molded more and more after the life of Christ."—Steps to Christ, pages 74, 75.



  11. For what should we earnestly and constantly pray? Matt.
6:13, first part.
     NOTE.—"While we are not to be dismayed by trial, bitter though it be, we
should pray that God will not permit us to be brought where we shall be
drawn away by the desires of our own evil hearts. In offering the prayer that
Christ has given, we surrender ourselves to the guidance of God, asking Him
to lead us in safe paths. We cannot offer this prayer in sincerity, and yet
decide to walk in any way of our own choosing. We shall wait for His hand
to lead us, we shall listen to His voice, saying, 'This is the way; walk ye in
it.' "—Thoughts From the Mount of lessing, page 171.
                                     [8]
  12. What assurance have we of deliverance from the power of
temptation? 1 Cor. 10:13; Prov. 18:10; Ps. 34:7.


    13. In the hour of temptation, to whom should we look for de-
liverance? Matt. 6:13, last part.
    NOTE.—"We are now standing on the threshold of great and solemn events.
A crisis is before us, such as the world has never witnessed. And sweetly to
us, as to the first disciples, comes the assurance that God's kingdom ruleth
over all. The program of coming events is in the hands of our Maker. The
Majesty of heaven has the destiny of nations, as well as the concerns of His
church, in His own charge.... He "who is the King, the Lord of hosts, sitteth
between the cherubim, and amid the strife and tumult of nations He guards
His children still. He who ruleth in• the heavens is our Saviour. He measures
every trial, He watches the furnace fire that must test every soul. When the
strongholds of kings shall be overthrown-, when the arrows of wrath shall
strike through the hearts of His enemies, His people will be safe in His hands."
—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, pages 175, 176.




                     Lesson 3, for July 20, 1946
           Our Father's Care for His Children
   LESSON SCRIPTURE: Matthew 6:19-34.
   MEMORY VERSE: "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and His righteousness;
and all these things shall be added unto you." Matt. 6:33.
   STUDY HELP: "Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing," pages 133-150.

                           Enduring Riches
     1. What does Jesus say concerning the accumulation of earthly
riches? Why this warning? Matt. 6:19, 21; Col. 3:2, 3.
   NozE.—"Treasure laid up on the earth will engross the mind, to the ex-
clusion of heavenly things."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, page
133.


    2. Where only can we safely lay up treasure? Matt. 6:20.
   NOTE.—"Christ    looks upon His people in their purity and perfection as
the reward of all His sufferings, His humiliation, and His love, and the sup-
plement of His glory,—Christ the great Center, from whom radiates all
glory.
   "And we are permitted to unite with Him in the great work of redemption,
and to be sharers with Him in the riches which His death and suffering have
won. . . . This is the treasure for which Christ bids us labor."—Thoughts
From the Mount of Blessing, page 134.
                                     [9 ]
     3. When and where shall we find this enduring treasure?
1 Thess. 2:19, 20; Jer. 29:13.
    NoTE.—"At the final day, when the wealth of earth shall perish, he who
has laid up treasure in heaven will behold that which his life has gained. If we
have given heed to the words of Christ, then, as we gather around the great
white throne, we shall see souls who have been saved through our agency, and
shall know that one has saved others, and these still others,—a large company
brought into the haven of rest as the result of our labors, there to lay their
crowns at Jesus' feet, and praise Him through the ceaseless ages of eternity.
With what joy will the worker for Christ behold these redeemed ones, who
share the glory of the Redeemer ! How precious will heaven be to those who
have been faithful in the work of saving souls !"—Thoughts From the Mount
of Blessing, page 135.

                            The Way of Life
     4. How does Jesus reveal the necessity of singleness of purpose,
and wholehearted devotion in our service to God? What will result
if one deliberately cherishes sinful desires? Matt. 6:22, 23.
    NOTE.—"Yielding to temptation begins in permitting the mind to waver,
to be inconstant in your trust in God. If we do not choose to give ourselves
fully to God, then we are in darkness. When we make any reserve, we are
leaving open a door through which Satan can enter to lead us astray by his
temptations. He knows that if he can obscure our vision, so that the eye of
faith cannot see God, there will be no barrier against sin."—Thoughts From
the Mount of Blessing, pages 136, 137.


     5. What can no man do? What two masters are mentioned?
Matt. 6:24.
    NOTE.—"No one can occupy a neutral position; there is no middle class,
who neither love God nor serve the enemy of righteousness.... He who does
not give himself wholly to God, is under the control of another power, lis-
tening to another voice, whose suggestions are of an entirely different char-
acter. Half-and-half service places the human agent on the side of the enemy,
as a successful ally of the hosts of darkness."—Thoughts From the Mount of
Blessing, page 139.

                          He Careth for You
     6. About what should we, as children of God, not feel undue
concern? What is most important? Matt. 6:25. "Be not anxious,"
R. V.
    NoTE.—"He who has given you life, knows your need of food to sustain
it. He who created the body, is not unmindful of your need of raiment. Will
not He who has bestowed the greater gift, bestow also what is needed to make
it complete?"—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, page 141.


    7. What example is given of our Father's tender care of His
children? Matt. 6:26.
                                     [10
    8. What question reveals the utter uselessness of worry? Matt.
6:27.
    Nom.—"Worry is blind, and cannot discern the future. But Jesus sees the
end from the beginning, and in every difficulty He has His way prepared to
bring relief. Abiding in Christ, we can do all things through Him who
strengthens us."—Testimonies, vol. 7, p. 298.


    9. What further illustration does Jesus use to enforce the lesson
of implicit trust in our Father's tender love and care for His chil-
dren? Matt. 6:28, 29.
   NOTE. "Consider, says Jesus, how the lilies grow; how, springing from
the cold, dark earth, or from the mud of the river bed, the plants unfold in
loveliness and fragrance. Who would dream of the possibilities of beauty in
the rough brown bulb of the lily? But when the life of God, hidden therein,
unfolds at His call in the rain and the sunshine, men marvel at the vision of
grace and loveliness. Even so will the life of God unfold in every human
soul that will yield itself to the ministry of His grace, which, free as the rain
and the sunshine, comes with its benediction to all. It is the word of God that
creates the flowers, and the same word will produce in you the graces of His
Spirit."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, page 144.

  10. What conclusion must we draw from this illustration? Matt.
6:30.

             Our Father Knows, He Loves, He Cares
  11. What admonition concerning anxiety for temporal things is
repeated? Matt. 6:31.
   NOTE.—"I have come," said Jesus, "to open to you the kingdom of love
and righteousness and peace. Open your hearts to receive this kingdom, and
make its service your highest interest. Though it is a spiritual kingdom, fear
not that your needs for this life will be uncared for. If you give yourself to
God's service, He who has all power in heaven and earth will provide for
your needs."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, page 147.


    12. What is the basis for this counsel? Matt. 6:32.
     NorE.—"Jesus does not release us from the necessity of effort, but He
 teaches that we are to make Him first and last and best in everything. We are
 to engage in no business, follow no pursuit, seek no pleasure, that would
 hinder the outworking of His righteousness in our character and life. What-
 ever we do, is to be done heartily, as unto the Lord."—Thoughts From the
 Mount of Blessing, pages 147, 148.


  13. What is to be our first concern? When this is done, what
 may we know will be added unto us? Matt. 6:33.
                               [11]
    NOTE.—"Jesus, while He dwelt on earth, dignified life in all• its details by
keeping before men the glory of God, and by subordinating everything to
the will of His Father. If we follow His example, His assurance to us is that
all things needful in this life 'shall be added.' Poverty or wealth, sickness or
health, simplicity or wisdom,—all are provided for in the promise of His
grace."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, page 148.



   14. What counsel does Jesus give concerning anxiety for our
future needs? Matt. 6:34; Isa. 54:10.
   NOTE.—"God's everlasting arm encircles the soul that turns to Him for
aid, however feeble that soul may be. The precious things of the hills shall
perish; but the soul that lives for God, shall abide with Him. 'The world
passeth away, and the lust thereof ; but he that doeth the will of God abideth
forever.' The city of God will open its golden gates to receive him who
learned while on earth to lean on God for guidance and wisdom, for comfort
and hope, amid loss and affliction. The songs of the angels will welcome him
there, and for him the tree of life shall yield its fruit."—Thoughts From the
Mount of Blessing, page 148.




                         Lesson 4, July 27, 1946

                          Practical Religion
   LESSON SCRIPTURE: Matthew 7:1-29.
   MEMORY VERSE: "Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should
do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets." Matt. 7:12.
   STUDY HELP: "Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing," pages 177-218.


                         Not Judging, but Doing
    1. What did Jesus say we should not do? If we fail to heed this
injunction, what will follow? Matt. 7:1, 2; Rom. 2:1.
   Nors.—"Ourselves faulty, we are not qualified to sit in judgment upon
others. Finite men can judge only from outward appearance. To Him alone
who knows the secret springs of action, and who deals tenderly and compas-
sionately, is it given to decide the case of every soul."—Thoughts From the
Mount of Blessing, page 179.


     2. What pertinent question is asked of one who judges another?
Matt. 7:3.
    NOTE.—"His [Christ's] words describe one who is swift to discern a defect
in others. When he thinks he has detected a flaw in the character or the life,
                                       [12 7
he is exceedingly zealous in trying to point it out; but Jesus declares that the
very trait of character developed in doing this un-Christlike work, is, in com-
parison with the fault criticized, as a beam in proportion to a mote. t is one's
own lack of the spirit of forbearance and love that leads him to make a world
of an atom."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, page 180.


     3. What inconsistent course is often taken toward a brother?
What should rather be done? Matt. 7:4, 5.
    NoTE.—"Not until you feel that you could sacrifice your own self-dignity,
and even lay down your life, in order to save an erring brother, have you
cast the beam out of your own eye, so that you are prepared to help your
brother. Then you can approach him, and touch his heart. . . . The revela-
tion of Christ in your own character will have a transforming power upon
all with whom you come in contact. Let Christ be daily made manifest in
you, and He will reveal through you the creative energy of His word,—a
gentle, persuasive, yet mighty influence to re-create other souls in the beauty
of the Lord our God."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, pages, 184,
185.


     4. What counsel should we follow respecting those who have
no desire to escape from the bondage of sin? Matt. 7:6.
    NoTE.—"Jesus here refers to a class who have no desire to escape from
the slavery of sin. By indulgence in the corrupt and vile, their natures have
become so degraded that they cling to the evil, and will not be separated from
it. The servants of Christ should not allow themselves to be hindered by
those who would make the gospel only a matter of contention and ridicule."—
Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, page 186.

                          Receiving God's Gifts
    5. Repeat the threefold promise made by Jesus to those who
obey Him. How does He emphasize the certainty of its fulfillment?
Matt. 7:7, 8.
    NOTE.—"While engaged in our daily work, we should lift the soul to
heaven in prayer. These silent petitions rise like incense before the throne of
grace ; and the enemy is baffled. The Christian whose heart is thus stayed
upon God cannot be overcome." !`To every sincere prayer an answer will
come. It may not come just as you desire, or at the time you look for it; but
it will come in the way and at the time that will best meet your need. The
prayers you offer in loneliness, in weariness, in trial, God answers, not always
according to your expectations, but always for your good."—Gospel Workers,
pages 254, 258.

    6. How does Jesus illustrate His willingness to give good gifts
to His children? From this what conclusion does He draw? Matt.
7:9-11.
   NOTE.-"It was to those whom He had bidden to seek first the kingdom
of God and His righteousness that Jesus gave the promise, 'Ask, and ye shall
                                   [13 ]
receive.' The gifts of Him who has all power in heaven and earth are in store
for the children of God. Gifts so precious that they come to us through the
costly sacrifice of the Redeemer's blood; gifts that will satisfy the deepest
craving of the heart; gifts lasting as eternity, will be received and enjoyed by
all who will come to God as little children. Take God's promises as your
own, plead them before Him as His own words, and you will receive fullness
of joy."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, page 191.


    7. What golden rule is given to govern all the relationships of
human fellowship? Matt. 7:12.
   NOTE.—"When those who profess the name of Christ shall practice the
principles of the golden rule, the same power will attend the gospel as in
apostolic times."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, page 196.

                        Two Ways for Travelers
    8. What two pathways are contrasted? What is said of each
class of travelers? Matt. 7:13, 14.
   NoTE.—"If you would climb the path of spiritual life, you must constantly
ascend; for it is an upward way. You must go with the few; for the multi-
tude will choose the downward path. . .. But the way to life is narrow, and
the entrance strait. If you cling to any besetting sin, you will find the way
too narrow for you to enter. Your own ways, your own will, your evil habits
and practices, must be given up if you would keep the way of the Lord. He
who would serve Christ cannot follow the world's opinions, or meet the
world's standard. . . . Toil, patience, self-sacrifice, reproach, poverty, the
contradiction of sinners against Himself, was the portion of Christ, and it
must be our portion, if we ever enter the Paradise of God."—Thoughts From
the Mount of Blessing, pages 197, 198.


    9. What warning of danger does Jesus give to those who walk
the narrow way? Matt. 7:15.


   10. How may we distinguish the teacher of false doctrine,
though concealed in sheep's clothing, from the teacher of truth?
Matt. 7:16-20.
    NOTE.—"Teachers of falsehood will arise to draw you away from the
narrow path and the strait gate. . . . We are not bidden to prove them by
their fair speeches and exalted professions. They are to be judged by the
word of God. . . . What message do these teachers bring? Does it lead you
to reverence and fear God? Does it lead you to manifest your love for Him
by loyalty to His commandments?"—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing,
page 208.

                     Character Building
  11. What is God's test of character for entrance into His king-
dom? Matt. 7:21; Luke 6:46.
                              [14 ]
  NOTE.—"Obedience is the test of discipleship. It is the keeping of the
commandments that proves the sincerity of our professions of love."—
Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, page 210.



12. What exalted profession will many make in "that day"?
What will Jesus say to them? Matt. 7:22, 23.
    NoTE.—"Saddest of all words that ever fell on mortal ear are those words
of doom, know you not.' " "In this life they have not entered into fellow-
ship with Christ; therefore they know not the language of heaven, they are
strangers to its joy." "Its light would fall'on blinded eyes, its meiody upon
deaf ears. Its love and joy could awake no chord of gladness in the world-
benumbed heart. You are shut out from heaven by your own unfitness for
its companionship."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 413.



13. To whom does Jesus liken the obedient hearer of His word?
What supreme test will such a house endure? Why? Matt. 7:24, 25.
    NoTE.—"The great principles of the law, of the very nature of God, are
embodied in the words of Christ on the mount. Whoever builds upon them
is building upon Christ, the Rock of Ages. In receiving the word, we receive
Christ. And only those who thus receive His words are building upon Him."
—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, page 213.



  14. To whom does Jesus liken the disobedient hearer of His
word? What test will a house thus built not stand? What is said
of its fall? Matt. 7:26, 27.
   NoTE.—"Thus Christ set forth the principles of His kingdom, and showed
them to be the great rule of life. To impress the lesson He adds an illustra-
tion. It is not enough, He says, for you to hear My words. By obedience
you must make them the foundation of your character. Self is but shifting
sand. If you build upon human theories and inventions, your house will fall.
By the winds of temptation, the tempests of trial, it will be swept away. But
these principles that I have given will endure. Receive Me; build on My
words."—The Desire of Ages, page 314.



  15. How did the teachings of Jesus affect the people? Why were
they so deeply moved? Matt. 7:28, 29.
   NoTE.—"The people had been deeply moved by the words of Christ. The
divine beauty of the principles of truth attracted them; and Christ's solemn
warnings had come to them as the voice of the heart-searching God."—

                     Lesson 5, for August 3, 1946
      Health for the Palsied; Life for the Dead
   LESSON SCRIPTURE: Luke 7:1-17.
   MEMORY VERSE: "Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou
hast believed, so be it done unto thee. And his servant was healed in the selfsame
hour." Matt. 8:13.
   STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pages 315-320.

                        The Centurion's Request
   1. Following the Sermon on the Mount, where did Jesus go?
Luke 7:1.

    2. What trouble had come to the home of a certain Roman
officer? What message did he ask the Jewish elders to take to Jesus?
Luke 7:2, 3.
   NOTE.—"The centurion's servant had been stricken with palsy, and lay at
the point of death. Among the Romans the servants were slaves, bought and
sold in the market places, and treated with abuse and cruelty; but the cen-
turion was tenderly attached to his servant, and greatly desired his recovery.
He believed that Jesus could heal him. He had not seen the Saviour, but the
reports he heard had inspired him with faith. . . . In the teaching of Christ,
as it had been reported to him, he found that which met the need of the soul.
All that was spiritual within him responded to the Saviour's words. But he
felt unworthy to come into the presence of Jesus, and he appealed to the
Jewish elders to make request for the healing of his servant."--The Desire of
Ages, page 315.


   3. What did the elders present to Jesus as a reason why He
should grant the centurion's request? Luke 7:4, 5.

   4. How did Jesus treat the appeal of this stranger? Whom did
He meet on the way to the centurion's home? Luke 7:6, first part.

    5. What message did they bring to Jesus? Of what two things
did he think himself unworthy? Luke 7:6 (last part), 7 (first part).

                              Faith Rewarded
   6. How did the centurion reveal his faith in Christ's infinite
power? Luke 7:7 (last part), 8; Ps. 107:20.
  NOTE.—"As I represent the power of Rome, and my soldiers recognize my
authority as supreme, so dost Thou represent the power of the Infinite God,
and all created things obey Thy word. Thou canst command the disease to
                                    16
depart, and it shall obey Thee. Thou canst summon Thy heavenly messen-
gers, and they shall impart healing virtue. Speak but the word, and my
servant shall be healed. . . . His heart had been touched by the grace of
Christ. He saw his own unworthiness; yet he feared not to ask help. He
trusted not to his own goodness; his argument was his great need. His faith
took hold upon Christ in His true character. He did not believe in Him
merely as a worker of miracles, but as the friend and Saviour of mankind."
—The Desire of Ages, pages 316, 317.

  7. How was Jesus affected by the great faith of the centurion?
What did He say to the people? Luke 7:9.

    8. What did Jesus say of the centurion? What was the result of
his faith? Matt. 8:13; Luke 7:10.

    9. Of what was this experience a foretaste to Jesus? Matt. 8:11,
12.
    Norg.—"To Jesus this was an earnest of the work which the gospel was
to accomplish among the Gentiles. With joy He looked forward to the gath-
ering of souls from all nations to His kingdom. With deep sadness He pic-
tured to the Jews the result of their rejection of His grace. . . . Alas, how
many are still preparing for the same fatal disappointment! While souls in
heathen darkness accept His grace, how many there are in Christian lands
upon whom the light shines only to be disregarded."—The Desire of Ages,
pages 317, 318.

                            A Funeral Train
   10. To what place did Jesus go the next day? Who accompanied
Him? Luke 7:11.
    NOTE.—"More than twenty miles from Capernaum, on a tableland over-
looking the wide, beautiful plain of Esdraelon, lay the village of Nain, and
thither Jesus next bent His steps. Many of His disciples and others were
with Him, and all along the way the people came, longing for His words of
love and pity, bringing their sick for His healing, and ever with the hope
that He who wielded such wondrous power would make Himself known as
the King of Israel. A multitude thronged His steps, and it was a glad, ex-
pectant company that followed Him up the rocky path toward the gate of
the mountain village."—The Desire of Ages, page 318.

  11. As they drew near the gate of the city, what did they behold?
Luke 7:12.

   12. How did this scene affect Jesus? What did He say to the
bereaved mother? Luke 7:13.
   Nora.—"It was a sight to awaken sympathy. The deceased was the only
son of his mother, and she a widow. The lonely mourner was following to
the grave her sole earthly support and comfort. 'When the Lord saw her, He
had compassion on her.' As she moved on blindly, weeping, noting not His
                                    [ 17 ]
presence, He came close beside her, and gently said, 'Weep not.' Jesus was
about to change her grief to joy, yet He could not forbear this expression of
tender sympathy."—The Desire of Ages, page 318.
                           From Deatb to Life
   13. What did Jesus do? What did He say? What was the result?
Luke 7:14, 15.
    NOTE.—"In clear, authoritative voice the words are spoken, 'Young man,
I say unto thee, Arise.' That voice pierces the ears of the dead. The young
man opens his eyes. Jesus takes him by the hand, and lifts him up. His gaze
falls upon her who has been weeping beside him, and mother and son unite
in a long, clinging, joyous embrace."—The Desire of Ages, page 318.

    14. How did this wonderful miracle affect the multitude? What
did they say to the glory of God? How far did the report extend?
Luke 7:16, 17.
    NoTE.—"He who stood beside the sorrowing mother at the gate of Nain,
watches with every mourning one beside the bier. He is touched with sym-
pathy for our grief. His heart, that loved and pitied, is a heart of unchange-
able tenderness. His word, that called the dead to life, is no less efficacious
now than when spoken to the young man of Nain. He says, 'All power is
given unto Me in heaven and in earth.' That power is not diminished by the
lapse of years, nor exhausted by the ceaseless activity of His overflowing
grace. To all who believe on Him He is still a living Saviour.
    "Jesus changed the mother's grief to joy when He gave back her son; yet
the youth was but called forth to this earthly life, to endure its sorrows, its
toils, and its perils, and to pass again under the power of death. But Jesus
comforts our sorrow for the dead with a message of infinite hope: 'I am He
that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive forevermore, . . . and
have the keys of hell and of death.' Forasmuch then as the children are
partakers of flesh and blood, He also Himself likewise took part of the same;
that through death He might destroy him that had the power of death, that
is, the devil; and deliver them who through fear of death were all their life-
time subject to bondage.' "—The Desire of Ages, pages 319, 320.


                   Lesson 6, for August 10, 1946
                          John the Baptist
    LESSON SCRIPTURES: Luke 7:18-35; Matt. 14:1-6; Mark 6:18-28.
    MEMORY VERSE: "Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown
of life." Rev. 2:10.
     STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pages 214-225.

                  A Fearless Messenger Despondent
    1. What had Herod Antipas done with John the Baptist? Why
had he done thus? Matt. 14:3, 4; Luke 3:19, 20.
    2. How did John hear of the works of Jesus? What message
did John send to Jesus? Luke 7:18, 19.
                                    ( 18
    NOTE.—"Like the Saviour's disciples, John the Baptist did not understand
the nature of Christ's kingdom. He expected Jesus to take the throne of
David; and as time passed, and the Saviour made no claim to kingly author-
ity, John became perplexed and troubled. . . . To the desert prophet all this
seemed a mystery beyond his fathoming. There were hours when the whis-
perings of demons tortured his spirit, and the shadow of a terrible fear crept
over him. Could it be that the long-hoped-for Deliverer had not yet ap-
peared?"—The Desire of Ages, pages 215, 216.

     3. While John's disciples were waiting, what did Jesus do?
What message did He request them to take to John? Luke 7:21-23.
    NOTE.—"The evidence of His divinity was seen in its adaptation to the
needs of suffering humanity. His glory was shown in His condescension to
our low estate.. . . The Saviour's words, 'Blessed is he, whosoever shall find
none occasion of stumbling in Me,' were a gentle reproof to John. It was not
lost upon him. Understanding more clearly now the nature of Christ's mis-
sion, he yielded himself to God for life or for death, as should best serve the
interests of the cause he loved."--The Desire of Ages, pages 217, 218.

   4. When John's disciples had departed, what three questions
concerning John did Jesus ask of the people? What reply did He
make to His last two questions? Luke 7:24-26.

                           A Great Messenger
  5. What Old Testament prophecy had met its partial fulfill-
ment in the work of John? Luke 7:27; Mal. 3:1, first part.

    6. What did Jesus then say of John as a prophet? Luke 7:28.
    NoTE.—"In the estimation of Heaven, what is it that constitutes great-
ness? Not that which the world accounts greatness; not wealth, or rank, or
noble descent, or intellectual gifts, in themselves considered. . . . When per-
verted to self-serving, the greater the gift, the greater curse it becomes. It is
moral worth that God values. Love and purity are the attributes He prizes
most. John was great in the sight of the Lord, when, before the messengers
from the Sanhedrin, before the people, and before his own disciples, he re-
frained from seeking honor for himself, but pointed all to Jesus as the Prom-
ised One. His unselfish joy in the ministry of Christ presents the highest type
of nobility ever revealed in man."—The Desire of Ages, page 219.

    7. How far-reaching had been the influence of the preaching
and the life of John? What did the Pharisees and lawyers do? Matt.
3:5, 6; Luke 7:29, 30.
   NOTE.—"Amid discord and strife, a voice was heard from the wilderness,
a voice startling and stern, yet full of hope: 'Repent ye; for the kingdom of
heaven is at hand.' With a new, strange power it moved the people. Prophets
had foretold the coming of Christ as an event far in the future; but here was
an announcement that it was at hand. John's singular appearance carried the
minds of his hearers back to the ancient seers. In his manner and dress he
                                     [ 19]
resembled the prophet Elijah. With the spirit and power of Elijah he de-
nounced the national corruption, and rebuked the prevailing sins. His words
were plain, pointed, and convincing. Many believed him to be one of the
prophets risen from the dead. The whole nation was stirred. Multitudes
flocked to the wilderness."—The Desire of Ages, page 104.

  8. To what did the Lord liken the men of that generation?
What did they say of John and of Jesus? Luke 7:31-35.

        .One of the Greatest of the Prophets Sacrificed
    9. How did Herodias, whom Herod had married unlawfully,
feel toward John? Why? Mark 6:18, 19, margin.

   10. How did Herod regard John? What did he know of him?
Mark 6:20.
    NOTE.—"Herod believed John to be a prophet of God, and he fully in-
tended to set him at liberty. But he delayed his purpose from fear of Hero-
dias."—The Desire of Ages, page 220.

  11. How was Herod's birthday celebrated? While under the
debasing influences of the occasion, what wicked promise did he
make? Mark 6:21-23.

12. What did Herodias instruct her daughter to ask of Herod?
What words were employed in making the request? Mark 6:24, 25.
 Non.—"By and by" is better translated "forthwith." R. V.

   13. How did this affect Herod? Why did he yield to this blood-
thirsty request? What did he immediately do? Mark 6:26-28.
    Nom.—"To many minds a deep mystery surrounds the fate of John the
Baptist. They question why he should have been left to languish and die in
prison. The mystery of this dark providence our human vision cannot pene-
trate; but it can never shake our confidence in God when we remember that
John was but a sharer in the sufferings of Christ. All who follow Christ will
wear the crown of sacrifice.... For the sake of thousands who in after years
must pass from prison to death, John was to drink the cup of martyrdom.
As the followers of Jesus should languish in lonely cells, or perish by the
sword, the rack, or the fagot, apparently forsaken by God and man, what a
stay to their hearts would be the thought that John the Baptist, to whose
faithfulness Christ Himself had borne witness, had passed through a similar
experience"I—The Desire of Ages, pages 223, 224.

   14. Later when Herod heard of Jesus and of His work, who did
he think He was? Matt. 14:1, 2.
    Non.—"God never leads His children otherwise than they would choose
to be led, if they could see the end from the beginning, and discern the glory
of the purpose which they are fulfilling as co-workers with Him. Not Enoch,

   was greater or more honored than John the Baptist, who perished alone in
   the dungeon. 'Unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe
    on Him, but also to suffer for His sake.' And of all the gifts that Heaven can
    bestow upon men, fellowship with Christ in His sufferings is the most weighty
. trust and the highest honor."—The Desire of Ages, page 225.



                       Lesson 7, for August 17, 1946
                      The Parable of the Sower
     LESSON. SCRIPTURE: Matthew 13:1-23.
     MEMORY VERSE: "He that received seed into the good ground is he that
  heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth,
  some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty." Matt. 13:23.
     STUDY HELP: "Christ's Object Lessons," pages 33-61 (new edition, pages
  27-59).
                        Four Kinds of Soil
      1. What is one means that God has chosen by which to reveal
  truth to mankind? Ps. 78:2; Matt. 13:34, 35.
      NoTE.—"In Christ's parable teaching the same principle is seen as in His
  own mission to the world. That we might become acquainted with His divine
  character and life, Christ took our nature, and dwelt among us. Divinity
  was revealed in humanity; the invisible glory in the visible human form.
  Men could learn of the unknown through the known; heavenly things were
  revealed through the earthly; God was made manifest in the likeness of men.
  So it was in Christ's teaching: the unknown was illustrated by the known;
  divine truths by earthly things with which the people were most familiar."
  "In parables He rebuked the hypocrisy and wicked works of those who occu-
  pied high positions, and in figurative language clothed truth of so cutting a
  character that had it been spoken in direct denunciation, they would not have
  listened to His words, and would speedily have put an end to His ministry."
  —Christ's Object Lessons, pages 17, 22.


     2. Describe the surroundings under which Jesus spoke His first
  parable. Matt. 13:1-3.

     3. Where did some of the seed sown fall? What became of it?
  Matt. 13:4.

      4. Where did other seed fall? With what result? Matt. 13:5,
  6; Luke 8:6.

       5. Where else did some seed fall? What befell it? Matt. 13:7.

      6. Where did still other seed fall? In this instance what was
  the result? Matt. 13:8.
                                         1211
   7. How did Jesus emphasize the importance of this parable?
Matt. 13:9, 18.

    8. What question did the disciples ask Jesus? What was His
reply? Matt. 13:10-15.

   9. Why are the disciples of Jesus so greatly blessed? Matt.
13:16, 17.
        By the Wayside; in Stony Ground; Among Thorns
   10. What explanation was given of seed falling by the wayside?
Matt. 13:19; Luke 8:11.
    NOTE. "The seed sown by the wayside represents the word of God as it
falls upon the heart of an inattentive hearer. Like the hard-beaten path,
trodden down by the feet of men and beasts, is the heart that becomes a
highway for the world's traffic, its pleasures and sins. Absorbed in selfish
aims and sinful indulgences, the soul is 'hardened through the deceitfulness
of sin.' The spiritual faculties are paralyzed. Men hear the word, but under-
stand it not. They do not discern that it applies to themselves. They do not
realize their need or their danger. They do not perceive the love of Christ,
and they pass by the message of His grace as something that does not con-
cern them. As the birds are ready to catch up the seed from the wayside, so
Satan is ready to catch away the seeds of divine truth from the soul."—
Christ's Object Lessons, page 44.

   11. What class is represented by him who received the seed on
stony ground? What experience causes discouragement? Matt.
13:20, 21.
   NoTE.—"There are very many who claim to serve God, but who have no
experimental knowledge of Him. Their desire to do His will is based upon
their own inclination, not upon the deep conviction of the Holy Spirit. Their
conduct is not brought into harmony with the law of God. They profess to
accept Christ as their Saviour, but they do not believe that He will give them
power to overcome their sins. They have not a personal relation with a living
Saviour, and their characters reveal defects both hereditary and cultivated."—
Christ's Object Lessons, page 48.

    12. What class is represented by those who receive the seed
among thorns? Matt. 13:22.
     NoTE.—"No class is free from the temptation to worldly care. To the
spoor, toil and deprivation and the fear of want bring perplexities and bur-
dens. To the rich come fear of loss and a multitude of anxious cares. Many
of Christ's followers forget the lesson He has bidden us learn from the flow-
ers of the field. They do not trust to His constant care. Christ cannot carry
their burden, because they do not cast it upon Him. Therefore the cares of
 life, which should drive them to the Saviour for help and comfort, separate
 them from Him. . . . It is impossible for the seed of the word to bring forth
 fruit; for the life of the soul is given to nourish the thorns of worldliness."—
 Christ's Object Lessons, pages 51, 52.
                                      [22 7
  13. At what time should special care be taken against the things
represented by the "thorns"? Luke 21:34, 35.

                              Into Good Soil
   14. Who is represented by him who received the seed into good
ground? Matt. 13:23; Luke 8:15.
    NOTE.—"The 'honest and good heart' of which the parable speaks, is not
a heart without sin; for the gospel is to be preached to the lost. Christ said,
`I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance' He has an honest
heart who yields to the conviction of the Holy Spirit. He confesses his guilt,
and feels his need of the mercy and love of God. He has a sincere desire to
know the truth, that he may obey it. The good heart is a believing heart, one
that has faith in the word of God. Without faith it is impossible to receive
the word. `He that cometh to God must believe that He is, and that He is a
rewarder of them that diligently seek Him.'"—Christ's Object Lessons, pages
58, 59.


   15. In view of God's great love for us, and of His ability to
save and keep us, what should we do? Luke 21:36; Jude 24.
   NOTE.—"The wayside, the stony-ground, the thorny-ground hearers need
not remain such. The Spirit of God is ever seeking to break the spell of in-
fatuation that bolds men absorbed in worldly things, and to awaken a desire
for the imperishable treasure. It is by resisting the Spirit that men become
inattentive to or neglectful of God's word." "God bids us fill the mind with
great thoughts, pure thoughts. He desires us to meditate upon His love and
mercy, to study His wonderful work in the great plan of redemption. Then
clearer and still dearer will be our perception of truth, higher, holier, our
desire for purity of heart and clearness of thought. The soul dwelling in the
pure atmosphere of holy thought will be transformed by communion with
God through the study of the Scriptures."—Christ's Object Lessons, pages
56, 60.


                    Lesson 8, for August 24, 1946
              Other Parables of the Kingdom
    LESSON SCRIPTURES: Mark 4:26-29; Matthew 13:31-52.
  ' MEMORY VERSE: "Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant-
man, seeking goodly pearls: who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went
and sold all that he had, and bought it." Matt. 13:45, 46.
    STUDY HELP: "Christ's Object Lessons," pages 62-69, 76-79, 95-134 (new
edition, pages 61-67, 75-79, 93-135).

                       Parable of the Sower
     1. .To what did Christ next compare the kingdom of God? Who
are represented by the sower and the reaper? Mark 4:26, 27.
   NOTE.—"The parable of the sower excited much questioning. Some of the
hearers gathered from it that Christ was not to establish an earthly kingdom;
                                     ( 23 1
and many were curious and perplexed. Seeing their perplexity Christ used
other illustrations, still seeking to turn their thoughts from the hope of a
worldly kingdom to the work of God's grace in the soul. . . .
   "The husbandman who `putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come,'
can be no other than Christ. It is He who at the last great day will reap the
harvest of the earth. But the sower of the seed represents those who labor
in Christ's stead. The seed is said to 'spring and grow up, he knoweth not
how,' and this is not true of the Son of God. Christ does not sleep over His
charge, but watches it day and night. He is not ignorant of how the seed
grows."—Christ's Object Lessons, pages 62, 63.

      2. What are the stages of the development of the plant? Of
what is this a beautiful figure? Mark 4:28, 29.
    NorE.—"The germination of the seed represents the beginning of spiritual
life, and the development of the plant is a beautiful figure of Christian growth.
As in nature, so in grace; there can be no life without growth. The plant must
either grow or die. As its growth is silent and imperceptible, but continuous,
so is the development of the Christian life. At every stage of development our
life may be perfect; yet if God's purpose for us is fulfilled, there will be con-
tinual advancement. Sanctification is the work of a lifetime. As our oppor-
tunities multiply, our experience will enlarge, and our knowledge increase.
We shall become strong to bear responsibility, and our maturity will be in
proportion to our privileges. . . .
    "The wheat develops, 'first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn
in the ear.' The object of the husbandman in the sowing of the seed and the
culture of the growing plant is the production of grain. He desires bread for
the hungry, and seed for future harvests. So the divine Husbandman looks
for a harvest as the reward of His labor and sacrifice. Christ is seeking to
reproduce Himself in the hearts of men; and He does this through those who
believe in Him. The object of the Christian life is fruit bearing,—the repro-
duction of Christ's character in the believer, that it may be reproduced in
others."—Christ's Object Lessons, pages 65-67.


                 The Mustard Seed and the Leaven
     3. With what questions did Jesus introduce another parable?
Mark 4:30.
    NOTE.—"In the multitude that listened to Christ's teaching there were
many Pharisees. These noted contemptuously how few of His hearers ac-
knowledged Him as the Messiah. And they questioned with themselves how
this unpretending teacher could exalt Israel to universal dominion. Without
riches, power, or honor, how was He to establish the new kingdom? Christ
read their thoughts and answered them."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 76.

     4. How does the mustard seed compare in size with other seeds?
When the plant is grown, how does it rank in size with other
herbs? Matt. 13:31, 32.
    NoTE.—"Thompson has seen mustard plants on the rich plain of Acre as
tall as a horse and its rider."—C. Geikie, Life of Christ.
    "Not only is the growth of Christ's kingdom illustrated by the parable of
                                     I 24
the mustard seed, but in every stage of its growth the experience represented
in the parable is repeated. For His church in every generation God has a
special truth and a special work. The truth that is hid from the worldly-wise
and prudent is revealed to the childlike and humble. . . .
    "And in this last generation the parable of the mustard seed is to reach a
signal and triumphant fulfillment. The little seed will become a tree. The
last message of warning and mercy is to go to 'every nation and kindred and
tongue,' to take out of them a people for His name.' And the earth shall be
lightened with His glory."—Christ's Object Lessons, pages 78, 79.


     5. How did Jesus further illustrate the nature of His kingdom?
Matt. 13:33.
   NOTE.—"The leaven hidden in the flour works invisibly to bring the whol
mass under its leavening process; so the leaven of truth works secretly, si-
lently, steadily, to transform the soul."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 98.

            Hidden Treasure; the Pearl of Great Price
     6. What lesson did Jesus seek to teach by the parable of the
hidden treasure? Matt. 13:44.
    NoTE.—"This parable illustrates the value of the heavenly treasure, and
the effort that should be made to secure it. The finder of the treasure in the
field was ready to part with all that he had, ready to put forth untiring labor,
in order to secure the hidden riches. So the finder of heavenly treasure will
count no labor too great and no sacrifice too dear, in order to gain the treas-
ures of truth."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 104.
    "In the parable the field containing the treasure represents the Holy
Scriptures. And the gospel is the treasure. The earth itself is not so interlaced
with golden veins and filled with precious things as is the word of God."
    "Our salvation depends on a knowledge of the truth contained in the
Scriptures. It is God's will that we should possess this. Search, 0 search the
precious Bible with hungry hearts. Explore God's word as the miner explores
the earth to find veins of gold. Never give up the search until you have
ascertained your relation to God and His will in regard to you."—I bid., pages
104, 111. Read Jer. 9:23, 24; John 17:3.


    7. What other illustration did Jesus use to represent the value
of the kingdom of heaven? How earnestly is it to be sought? Matt.
13:45, 46.
    NOTE.—"Christ Himself is the pearl of great price. In Him is gathered all
the glory of the Father, the fullness of the Godhead. He is the brightness of
the Father's glory and the express image of His person. The glory of the at-
tributes of God is expressed in His character. Every page of the Holy Scrip-
tures shines with His light. The righteousness of Christ, as a pure, white
pearl, has no defect, no stain. No work of man can improve the great and
precious gift of God. It is without a flaw. In Christ are 'hid all the treasures
of wisdom and knowledge.' He is 'made unto us wisdom, and righteousness,
and sanctification, and redemption.'"—Christ's Object Lessons, page 115.

                       A Fisherman's Net
   8. With what familiar illustration did Jesus compare another
phase of His spiritual kingdom? Matt. 13:47.

    9. Explain the course pursued by the fishermen. Matt. 13:48.

   10. What will take place at the end of this world? Matt. 13:49,
50.
    NoTE.—"The casting of the net is the preaching of the gospel. This gathers
both good and evil into the church. When the mission of the gospel is com-
pleted, the judgment will accomplish the work of separation... .
    "Throughout the period of probationary time His Spirit is entreating men
to accept the gift of life. It is only those who reject His pleading that will be
left to perish. God has declared that sin must be destroyed as an evil ruinous
to the universe. Those who cling to sin will perish in its destruction."—
Christ's Object Lessons, pages 122, 123.
                          Things New and Old
  11. After speaking these parables, what question did Jesus ask
His disciples? What was their reply? Matt. 13:51.

   12. By what comparison did Jesus illustrate the work of His
followers? What does Jesus mean by things "new and old"? Matt.
13:52.
    NorE.—"The treasure 'gained by the householder he does not hoard. He
brings it forth to communicate to others. And by use the treasure increases.
The householder has precious things both new and old. So Christ teaches that
the truth committed to His disciples is to be communicated to the world. And
as the knowledge of truth is imparted, it will increase."—Christ's Object Les-
sons, page 124.
    "In every age there is a new development of truth, a message of God to
the people of that generation. The old truths are all essential; new truth is
not independent of the old, but an unfolding of it. It is only as the old
truths are understood that we can comprehend the new. When Christ desired
to open to His disciples the truth of His resurrection, He began 'at Moses and
all the prophets,' and 'expounded unto them in all the Scriptures the things
concerning Himself.' But it is the light which shines in the fresh unfolding
of truth that glorifies the old. He who rejects or neglects the new, does not
really possess the old. For him it loses its vital power, and becomes but a
lifeless form. . . . Many who claim to believe and to teach the gospel .. . set
aside the Old Testament Scriptures, of which Christ declared, 'They are they
which testify of Me.' In rejecting the Old, they virtually reject the New; for
both are parts of an inseparable whole. No man can rightly present the law
of God without the gospel, or the gospel without the law. The law is the
gospel embodied, and the gospel is the law unfolded. The law is the root, the
gospel is the fragrant blossom and fruit which it bears."—Ibid., pages 127,
128.

                   The Parable of the Tares
   LESSON SCRIPTURE: Matthew 13:24-30, 36-43.
   MEMORY VERSE: "Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the king-
dom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear." Matt. 13:43.
   STUDY HELP: "Christ's Object Lessons," pages 70-75 (new edition, pages
69-73).

                         Seed Sowing
    1. Continuing His wonderful parables, to what did Jesus again
liken the kingdom of heaven? Matt. 13:24.


     2. What occurred while men slept? When was the work of the
enemy revealed? Matt. 13:25, 26.
    NOTE.—" 'Tares' of the parable denotes the weed called 'bearded darnel'
... The bearded darnel before it comes into ear is very similar in appearance
to wheat, and roots of the two are often intertwined.... This darnel is easily
distinguishable from the wheat or barley, when headed out, but, when both
are less developed, 'the closest scrutiny will often fail to detect it.' "—William
Smith, A Dictionary of the Bible.

  3. What questions did the servants of the householder ask?
What was his reply? Matt. 13:27, 28, first part.


   4. What further question did the servants ask? What reply
did the householder make? Matt. 13:28 (last part), 29.


     5. How long should the wheat and tares be allowed to grow
together? At harvesttime what did the householder say to the
reapers? Matt. 13:30.
    NcrrE.—"Christ has plainly taught that those who persist in open sin must
be separated from the church; but He has not committed to us the work of
judging character and motive. He knows our nature too well to entrust this
work to us. Should we try to uproot from the church those whom we sup-
pose to be spurious Christians, we should be sure to make mistakes. Often
we regard as hopeless subjects the very ones whom Christ is drawing to Him-
self. Were we to deal with these'souls according to our imperfect judgment,
it would perhaps extinguish their last hope....
    "There is in the Saviour's words another lesson, a lesson of wonderful
forbearance and tender love. As the tares have their roots closely intertwined
 with those of the good grain, so false brethren in the church may be closely
 linked with true disciples. The real character of these pretended believers is
 not fully manifested. Were they to be separated from the church, others
 might be caused to stumble, who but for this would have remained steadfast."
 —Christ's Object Lessons, pages 71, 72.

                      The Parable Explained
    6. After Jesus had dismissed the multitude, what question did
the disciples ask of Him? Matt. 13:36.

    7. Who is the sower of the good seed? Matt. 13:37.

    8. What is the field? the good seed? the tares? Matt. 13:38.
   NorE.—"The Holy Spirit has gone out into all the world; everywhere it is
moving upon the hearts of men; but it is in the church that we are to grow
and ripen for the garner of God. . . . 'The good seed are the children of the
kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one.' The good seed
represents those who are born of the word of God, the truth. The tares rep-
resent a class who are the fruit or embodiment of error, of false principles."
—Christ's Object Lessons, pages 70, 71.

   9. Who is the enemy that sowed the tares? When is the har-
vesttime? Who are the reapers? Matt. 13:39.
                 The End of the Reign of Sin
  10. What is usually done with tares? When will this course be
followed with the tares of the parable? Matt. 13:40.

11. What great events will take place at the end of this world?
Matt. 13:41, 42.

   12. How complete will be the destruction of the wicked in the
last great day? Why do they thus suffer? Ps. 37:20; Mal. 4:1.
   NOTE.—"This is not an act of arbitrary power on the part of God. The
rejectors of His mercy reap that which they have sown. God is the fountain
of life; and when one chooses the service of sin, he separates from God, and
thus cuts himself off from life. He is 'alienated from the life of God.' Christ
says, 'All they that hate Me love death.' God gives them existence for a time
that they may develop their character and reveal their principles. This accom-
plished, they receive the results of their own choice. By a life of rebellion,
Satan and all who unite with him place themselves so out of harmony with
God that His very presence is to them a consuming fire. The glory of Him
who is love will destroy them."—The Desire of Ages, pages 763, 764.

         The Beginning of the Reign of Righteousness
  13. When all traces of sin shall have been removed, how com-
plete will be the work of restoration? Isa. 65:17; Rev. 21:1, 4, 5, 7.

  14. What transcendently glorious experience awaits the class
represented in the parable by the wheat? Matt. 13:43.
   NOTE.—"The years of eternity, as they roll, will bring richer and still more
glorious revelations of God and of Christ. As knowledge is progressive, so
                                    128]
will love, reverence, and happiness increase. The more men learn of God, the
greater will be their admiration of His character. As Jesus opens before them
the riches of redemption, and the amazing achievements in the great contro-
versy with Satan, the hearts of the ransomed thrill with more fervent devo-
tion, and with more rapturous joy they sweep the harps of gold; and ten
thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands of voices unite to
swell the mighty chorus of praise....
   "The great controversy is ended. Sin and sinners are no more. The entire
universe is clean. One pulse of harmony and gladness beats through the vast
creation. From Him who created all, flow life and light and gladness, through-
out the realms of illimitable space. From the minutest atom to the greatest
world, all things, animate and inanimate, in their unshadowed beauty and
perfect joy, declare that God is love."—The Great Controversy, page 678.

God hath done unto thee. And he went his way, and published throughout the whole
city how great things Jesus had done unto him." Luke 8:39.

                      Stilling the Angry Waters
    1. After speaking His parables concerning the nature of His
kingdom, what did Jesus suggest to His disciples? Mark 4:35; Luke
8:22.
   NoTE.—"All day He had been teaching and healing; and as evening came
on, the crowds still pressed upon Him. Day after day He had ministered to
them, scarcely pausing for food or rest. The malicious criticism and misrepre-
sentation with which the Pharisees constantly pursued Him made His labors
much more severe and harassing; and now the close of the day.found Him so
utterly wearied that He determined to seek retirement in some solitary place
across the lake."—The Desire of Ages, page 333.

  2. What did the disciples do? How were they accompanied?
Mark 4:36.

     3. How did Jesus reveal His weariness? Luke 8:23, first part.

    4. What peril threatened the disciples? To whom did they
appeal for help? Mark 4:37; Luke 8:23 (last part), 24.
   NOTE.—"Absorbed in their efforts to save themselves, they had forgotten
that Jesus was on board. Now, seeing their labor vain and only death before
them, they remembered at whose command they had set out to cross the sea.
In Jesus was their only hope. In their helplessness and despair they cried,
`Master, Master!' But the dense darkness hid Him from their sight. Their
                                     (29 ]
voices were drowned by the roaring of the tempest, and there was no reply.
Doubt and fear assailed them. Had Jesus forsaken them? Was He who had
conquered disease and demons, and even death, powerless to help His dis-
ciples now? Was He unmindful of them in their distress?
   "Again they call, but there is no answer except the shrieking of the angry
blast. Already their boat is sinking. A moment, and apparently they will be
swallowed up by the hungry waters."—The Desire of Ages, page 334.

     5. What was the Saviour's response to this. urgent appeal?
What was the result? Mark 4:38, 39.
    NOTE.—"Their cry arouses Jesus. As the lightning's glare reveals Him,
they see the peace of heaven in His face; they read in His glance self-forget-
ful, tender love, and, their hearts turning to Him, cry, 'Lord, save us: we
perish.' .
   "The storm ceases. The billows sink to rest. The clouds roll away, and
the stars shine forth. The boat rests upon a quiet sea."—The Desire of Ages,
pages 334, 335.

     6. What mild reproof did Jesus administer? How did the dis-
ciples express their amazement at the wonderful miracle of their
deliverance? Mark 4:40, 41.
    NOTE.—"How often the disciples' experience is ours! When the tempests
of temptation gather, and the fierce lightnings flash, and the waves sweep
over us, we battle with the storm alone, forgetting that there is One who can
help us. We trust to our own strength till our hope is lost, and we are ready
to perish. Then we remember Jesus, and if we call upon Him to save us, we
shall not cry in vain. Though He sorrowfully reproves our unbelief and self-
confidence, He never fails to give us the help we need."—The Desire of Ages,
page 336.
              Evil Spirits Subject to Christ's Command
     7. When Jesus and His disciples went ashore, by whom were
they met? Luke 8:27; Matt. 8:28.
    NOTE.—"Matthew mentions two demoniacs;,Mark and Luke but one....
The common and most probable explanation is, that there were indeed two,
but that one was much more prominent than the other, either as the fiercer
of the two, or as of a higher rank and better known, and therefore alone
mentioned by Mark and Luke."—Samuel J. Andrews, The Life of Our Lord,
1863 ed., p. 243.
    "Hanging about these men were parts of chains which they had broken
in escaping from confinement. Their flesh was torn and bleeding where they
had cut themselves with sharp stones. Their eyes glared out from their long
and matted hair, the very likeness of humanity seemed to have been blotted
out by the demons that possessed them, and they looked more like wild
beasts than like men."—The Desire of Ages, page 337.

   8. What did the unfortunate men do? What did the demons
cause them to say? How completely were the men under their
dominion? Luke 8:28, 29.
  NOTE.—"With authority He bade the unclean spirits come out of them.
                             [so ]
His words penetrated the darkened minds of the unfortunate men. They real-
ized dimly that One was near who could save them from the tormenting
demons. They fell at the Saviour's feet to worship Him; but when their lips
were opened to entreat His mercy, the demons spoke through them, crying
vehemently, 'What have I to do with Thee, Jesus, Thou Son of God most
high? I beseech Thee, torment me not.' "—The Desire of Ages, page 338.

   9. What question did Jesus ask? What reply did He receive?
Luke 8:30.

  10. Using the afflicted men as a medium of communication, what
request did the evil spirits make of Jesus? What was feeding
near by? What additional request did the demons make? Luke
8:31, 32.

   11. What is revealed concerning the origin of evil spirits? Rev.
12:7-9.
    NorE.—"Evil spirits, in the beginning created sinless, were equal in nature,
power, and glory with the holy beings that are now God's messengers. But
fallen through sin, they are leagued together for the dishonor of God and the
destruction of men. United with Satan in his rebellion, and with him cast
out from heaven, they have, through all succeeding ages, co-operated with
him in his warfare against the divine authority. We are told in Scripture of
their confederacy and government, of their various orders, of their intelli-
gence and subtlety, and of their malicious designs against the peace and hap-
piness of men."—The Great Controversy, page 513.
   12. Where were the demons permitted to go? What was the
result? Mark 5:13.
    NorE.—"He [Jesus] allowed the evil spirits to destroy the herd of swine
as a rebuke to those Jews who were raising these unclean beasts for the sake
of gain. Had not Christ restrained the demons, they would have plunged
into the sea, not only the swine, but also their keepers and owners. The
preservation of both the keepers and the owners was due alone to His power,
mercifully exercised for their deliverance. Furthermore, this event was per-
mitted to take place that the disciples might witness the cruel power of
Satan upon both man and beast."—The Great Controversy, page 515.
                 Christ's Renown Broadcast
  13. When the people heard of this manifestation 'of divine
power, what did they do? What did they see? Luke 8:35.
  14. What did eyewitnesses of the miracle tell the people? What
request did they unitedly make? Luke 8:36, 37.

   15. What earnest appeal did the healed men make? What was
the Saviour's reply? How faithfully did they carry out this com-
mission? Luke 8:38, 39.
    NoTE.—"Here was a work for them to do,—to go to a heathen home, and
tell of the blessing they had received from Jesus. It was hard for them to be
                                      [ 31 ]
separated from the Saviour. Great difficulties were sure to beset them in
association with their heathen countrymen. And their long isolation from
society seemed to have disqualified them for the work He had indicated. But
as soon as Jesus pointed out their duty, they were ready to obey. Not only
did they tell their own households and neighbors about Jesus, but they went
throughout Decapolis, everywhere declaring His power to save, and describ-
ing bow He had freed them from the demons. In doing this work, they could
receive a greater blessing than if, merely for benefit to themselves, they had
remained in His presence. It is in working to spread the good news of salva-
tion that we are brought near to the Saviour."—The Desire of Ages, pages
339, 340.

8:47.
    STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pages 342-348.

                    The Request of Jairus
   1. After healing the demoniacs of Gadara, to what place did
Jesus go? How was He received? Luke 8:40; Mark 5:21.

     2. On this occasion what prominent person came in great dis-
tress, seeking Jesus? How did he reveal his humility? 'Luke 8:41.
    NOTE.—"Returning from Gergesa to the western shore, Jesus found a mul-
titude gathered to receive Him, and they greeted Him with joy. He remained
by the seaside for a time, teaching and healing, and then repaired to the house
of Levi-Matthew to meet the publicans at the feast. Here Jairus, the ruler
of the synagogue, found Him."—The Desire of Ages, page 342.
    "A ruler of the synagogue, ... or chief elder of the congregation, to whom
the Jews looked with great respect."—Frederic W. Farrar, The Life of Christ.

    3. What was the cause of this ruler's distress? What evidence
of faith in Jesus did he reveal? Luke 8:42; Mark 5:23.

     4. How did Jesus respond? Who accompanied Him? Mark 5:24.
   NOTE.—"Jesus     set out at once with the ruler for his home. Though the
disciples had seen so many of His works of mercy, they were surprised at His
compliance with the entreaty of the haughty rabbi; yet they accompanied
their Master, and the people followed, eager and expectant. The ruler's house
was not far distant, but Jesus and His companions advanced slowly, for the
crowd pressed Him on every side. The anxious father was impatient of delay;
but Jesus, pitying the people, stopped now and then to relieve some suffering
one, or to comfort a troubled heart."—The Desire of Ages, page 342.
                                      [32 1
                       The Touch of Faith
   5. When on His way to the ruler's house, who was in the throng
pressing toward Jesus? How long had she been ill? From whom
had she sought relief, and with what result? Mark 5:25, 26.
   6. Having heard of Jesus, how did she manifest her faith in His
healing power? What did she say in her heart? Mark 5:27, 28._
   Nora.—"The golden opportunity had come. She was in the presence of
the Great Physician ! But amid the confusion she could not speak to Him,
nor catch more than a passing glimpse of His figure. Fearful of losing her
one chance of Orelief, she pressed forward, saying to herself, 'If I may but
touch His garment, I shall be whole.' "—The Desire of Ages, pages 343, 344.

    7. How was her faith rewarded? Mark 5:29.
   NOTE.—"As He was passing, she reached forward, and succeeded in barely
touching the border of His garment. But in that moment she knew that
she was healed. In that one touch was concentrated the faith of her life, and
instantly her pain and feebleness gave place to the vigor of perfect health."—
The Desire of Ages, page 344.

    8. Of what was Jesus immediately conscious? What question
did He ask? What was the response of His disciples? Mark 5:30, 31.
    9. What public testimony did the healed woman tremblingly'
bear? What comforting words did Jesus speak to her? Luke 8:47,
48.
   NOTE.—"With grateful tears she told the story of her suffering, and how
she had found relief. Jesus gently said, 'Daughter, be of good comfort: thy
faith hath made thee whole ; go in peace.' He gave no opportunity for super-
stition to claim healing virtue for the mere act of touching His garments. It
was not through the outward contact with Him, but through the faith Which
took hold on His divine power, that the cure was wrought."—The Desire of
Ages, pages 344, 347.

   10. How can we who have long been afflicted with the most
fatal of all diseases—sin—find complete deliverance? 1 John 5:4;
1:7.
   NOTE.—"To talk of religion in a casual way, to pray without soul hunger
and living faith, avails nothing. . . . The only faith that will benefit us is
that which embraces Him as a personal Saviour; which appropriates His
merits to ourselves. Many hold faith as an opinion. Saving faith is a trans-
action by which those who receive Christ join themselves in covenant rela-
tion with God. Genuine faith is life. A living faith means an increase of
vigor, a confiding trust, by which the soul becomes a conquering power."—
The Desire of Ages, page 347.

                   A Sad Message Received
  11. What message came to Jairus from his home? What word
of encouragement and assurance did Jesus give the ruler?. Mark
5:35, 36; Luke 8:49, 50.
                                    [ 33 ]
  12. Who only were permitted to go into the house with Jesus?
What noisy demonstration was in progress? Luke 8:51; Mark 5:38-
40.
                            Grief Turned to Joy
    13. In restoring life to the deceased, what did Jesus do? What
effect did this have upon those present? Mark 5:41, 42.
    NoTE.—"Jesus approached the bedside, and taking the child's hand in His
own, He pronounced softly, in the familiar language of her home, the words,
`Damsel, I say unto thee, Arise.'
    "Instantly a tremor passed through the unconscious form! The pulses of
life beat again. The lips unclosed with a smile. The eyes opened widely as if
from sleep, and the maiden gazed with wonder on the group beside her. She
arose, and her parents clasped her in their arms, and wept for joy."—The
Desire of Ages, page 343.

   14. What charge did Jesus give those present? What were they
to do for the child? Mark 5:4-3.



                  Lesson 12, for September 21, 1946
              Healing the Blind and the Dumb
   'LESSON SCRIPTURE: Matthew 9:27-38.
    MEMORY VERSE: "Then saith He unto His disciples, The harvest truly is
plenteous, but the laborers are few; pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that He
will send forth laborers into His harvest." Matt. 9:37, 38.
    STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pages 321-323, 349-351.

                          Two Blind Men Healed
    1. As Jesus reappeared from the home of Jairus, who followed
Him? What urgent appeal did they make? Matt. 9:27.
   NoTE.—They called Him "Son of David." Two things here are worthy of
remark: (a) That it was a generally received opinion at this time in Judea
that the Messiah should be the Son of David. John 7:42. (b) That Jesus
Christ was generally and incontestably acknowledged as coming from this
stock. Matt. 12:23.

    2. Still urging their plea, to what place did the blind men fol-
low Jesus? What pointed question did He ask them? What was
their reply? Matt. 9:28.


  3. What did Jesus then do and say? What was the result?
Matt. 9:29, 30, first part.
                            [ 34 ]
    4. What distinct charge did Jesus lay upon them? What did
they do? Matt. 9:30 (last part), 31.
   NOTE.—"The prudent charge not to speak of their restored sight, so nec-
essary after all that had lately passed, was heard only to be forgotten, for, in
their joy, they could not refrain from publishing it wherever they went"—
C. Geikie, Life and Words of Christ.


                    A Dumb Man Healed
   5. As they went out of the house, who was brought to Jesus?
Matt. 9:32.

  6. What was the cause of this man's affliction? What miracle
was wrought? How did this affect the multitude? Matt. 9:33.

     7. To whom did the Pharisees attribute Jesus' power over de-
mons? Matt. 9:34.
    NcrrE.—"Christ told them [Pharisees] plainly that in attributing the work
of the Holy Spirit to Satan, they were cutting themselves off from the foun-
tain of blessing. Those who had spoken against Jesus Himself, not discerning
His divine character, might receive forgiveness; for through the Holy Spirit
they might be brought to see their error and repent. Whatever the sin, if the
soul repents and believes, the guilt is washed away in the blood of Christ;
but he who rejects the work of the Holy Spirit is placing himself where re-
pentance and faith cannot come to him. It is by the'Spirit that God works
upon the heart; when men willfully reject the Spirit, and declare it to be
from Satan, they cut off the channel by which God can communicate with
them. When the Spirit is.finally rejected, there is no more that God can do
for the soul."—The Desire of Ages, pages 321, 322.

                  Teaching and Healing
   8. How extensively did Jesus carry forward His work? Matt.
9:35, first part.

    9. What three lines of His ministry are especially mentioned?
Matt. 9:35, last part.
   NOTE.—"The Saviour made each work of healing an occasion for implant-
ing divine principles in the mind and soul. This was the purpose of His work.
He imparted earthly blessings, that He might incline the hearts of men to
receive the gospel of His grace."—The Ministry of Healing, page 20.

10. What condition among the people aroused His compassion?
Matt. 9:36.
                                      [35]
  11. What did Jesus say to His disciples about the condition of
the harvest and the fields? Matt. 9:37; John 4:35.

   12. For what were they to pray? Matt. 9:38.
   NOTE. "The judgments of God are in the earth, and, under the influence
of the Holy Spirit, we must give the message of warning that He has en-
trusted to us. We must give this message quickly, line upon line, precept upon
precept. Men will soon be forced to great decisions, and it is our duty to
see that they are given an opportunity to understand the truth, that they
may take their stand intelligently on the right side. The Lord calls upon His
people to labor—labor earnestly and wisely—while probation lingers."—Tes-
timonies, vol. 9, pp. 126, 127.



                   Lesson 13, for September 28, 1946
                        The First Evangelists
    LESSON SCRIPTURE: Matthew 10:1-23.
    MEMORY VERSE: "As ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at
hand. Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have
received, freely give." Matt. 10:7, 8.
    STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pages 349-358.

                 Healing and Teaching Power
   1. Having called together His twelve disciples, what power did
Jesus give them? Matt. 10:1; Luke 9:1.

    2. Name the twelve apostles. Matt. 10:2-4.

    3. As they went forth what were they to do? Luke 9:2.
   Norc.—"Calling the twelve about Him, Jesus bade them go out two and
two through the towns and villages. None were sent forth alone, but brother
was associated with brother, friend with friend. Thus they could help and
encourage each other, counseling and praying together, each one's strength
supplementing the other's weakness."—The Desire of Ages, page 350.

    4. What restriction did Jesus place upon them in their minis-
try? Matt. 10:5.
   NOTE.—"The disciples on their first missionary tour were to go only to
`the lost sheep of the house of Israel.' If they had now preached the gospel
to the Gentiles or the Samaritans, they would have lost their influence with
the Jews. By exciting the prejudice of the Pharisees they would have in-
volved themselves in controversy which would have discouraged them at the
outset of their labors. Even the apostles were slow to understand that the
gospel was to be carried to all nations. Until they themselves could grasp
this truth they were not prepared to labor for the Gentiles."—The Desire of
Ages, page 351.
                                        [ 36 ]
                       Their Message and Work
    5. To whom were they sent? Matt. 10:6.
   NOTE.--"If the Jews would receive the gospel, God purposed to make
them His messengers to the Gentiles. Therefore they were first to hear the
message."—The Desire of Ages, page 351.


    6. What message were they to preach? Matt. 10:7.
   NoTE.—"The disciples' message was the same as that of John the Baptist
and of Christ Himself: 'The kingdom of heaven is at hand.' They were to
enter into no controversy with the people as to whether Jesus of Nazareth
was the Messiah; but in His name they were to do the same works of mercy
as He had done."—The Desire of Ages, page 350.


    '7. In connection with their preaching, what work were the
disciples to do? In what spirit were they to labor? Matt. 10:8.
    NOTE.—"The followers of Christ are to labor as He did. We are to feed
the hungry, clothe the naked, and comfort the suffering and afflicted. We are
to minister to the despairing, and inspire hope in the hopeless. And to us
also the promise will be fulfilled, 'Thy righteousness shall go before thee; the
glory of the Lord shall be thy rearward.' . . . The missionary cannot only
relieve physical maladies, but he can lead the sinner to the Great Physician,
who can cleanse the soul from the leprosy of sin. Through His servants, God
designs that the sick, the unfortunate, those possessed of evil spirits, shall
hear His voice. Through His human agencies He desires to be a Comforter
such as the world knows not."—The Desire of Ages, pages 350, 351.

                            Methods of Labor
    8. What customary preparations for traveling were they not
to make? Matt. 10:9, 10.
   NcrrE.—"On this first tour the disciples were to go only where Jesus had
been before them, and had made friends. Their preparation for the journey
was to be of the simplest kind. Nothing must be allowed to divert their
minds from their great work, or in any way excite opposition and close the
door for further labor. They were not to adopt the dress of the religious
teachers, nor use any guise in apparel to distinguish them from the humble
peasants."—The Desire of Ages, page 351.


    9. When entering a city or town; what were these representa-
tives of the Saviour to do? When entering a house, what were they
to do? Matt. 10:11-13.
   NOTE.—"Ali over the field of Christ's labor there were souls awakened to
their need, and hungering and thirsting for the truth. The time had come to
send the tidings of His love to these longing hearts. To all these the disciples
were to go as His representatives. The believers would .thus be led to look
upon them as divinely appointed teachers, and when the Saviour should be
                                       87
taken from them, they would not be left without instructors.... They were
not to waste time in needless salutations, or in going from house to house for
entertainment. But in every place they were to accept the hospitality of those
who were worthy, those who would welcome them heartily as if entertaining
Christ Himself. They were to enter the dwelling with the beautiful saluta-
tion, 'Peace be to this house.' That home would be blessed by their prayers,
their songs of praise, and the opening of the Scriptures in the family circle."
—The Desire of Ages, pages 351, 352.


   10. In case of the rejection of their message, what were the
disciples to do? How serious would such a rejection be regarded
in the judgment? Matt. 10:14, 15.


                        Confronted With Perils
   11. In sending forth His disciples, what danger did Jesus say
would confront them? At all times, therefore, what rule was to
govern them in their course of action? Matt. 10:16.
   NorE.—"The spirit that is kept gentle under provocation will speak more
effectively in favor of the truth than will any argument, however forcible.
   "Those who are brought in controversy with the enemies of truth have
to meet, not only men, but Satan and his agents. Let them remember the
Saviour's words, 'Behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.' Let them
rest in the love of God, and the spirit will be kept calm, even under personal
abuse."—The Desire of Ages, page 353.


    12. What would men do to them? Before whom would they be
brought? For what reason? Matt. 10:17, 18.
    NorE.—"Persecution will spread the light. The servants of Christ will be
brought before the great men of the world, who, but for this, might never
hear the gospel. The truth has been misrepresented to these men. They have
listened to false charges concerning the faith of Christ's disciples. Often their
only means of learning its real character is the testimony of those who are
brought to trial for their faith. Under examination these are required to
answer, and their judges to listen to the testimony borne. God's grace will
be dispensed to His servants to meet the emergency."—The Desire of Ages,
page 354.


   13. Under such circumstances, about what are God's faithful
servants not to be anxious? What help is assured them in that
hour? Matt. 10:19, 20.
    NOTE.—"The servants of Christ were to prepare no set speech to present
when brought to trial. Their preparation was to be made day by day in
treasuring up the precious truths of God's word, and through prayer strength-
ening their faith. When they were brought into trial, the Holy Spirit would
                                     [ 38 ]
bring to their remembrance the very truths that would be needed." "As the
Spirit of God illuminates the minds of His servants, the truth will be pre-
sented in its divine power and preciousness."—The Desire of Ages, pages 355,
354.


  14. As the result of accepting and following Jesus, what division
would take place in families? What bitter hatred would be aroused?
What blessed assurance is given the faithful? Matt. 10:21, 22.
   NoTE.—"So bitter would be the enmity to the gospel that even the ten-
derest earthly ties would be disregarded. The disciples of Christ would be be-
trayed to death by the members of their own households." "Of all persecu-
tion the hardest to bear is variance in the home, the estrangement of dearest
earthly friends. But Jesus declares, 'He that loveth father or mother more
than Me is not worthy of Me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than
Me is not worthy of Me. And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth
after Me, is not worthy of Me.' "—The Desire of Ages, pages 355, 357.


15. What were the disciples instructed to do when persecuted?
Matt. 10:23.
   NorE.—"He bade them not to expose themselves unnecessarily to perse-
cution. He Himself often left one field of labor for another, in order to escape
from those who were seeking His life. When He was rejected at Nazareth,
and His own townsmen tried to kill Him, He went down to Capernaum, and
there the people were astonished at His teachings; 'for His word was with
power.' So His servants were not to be discouraged by persecution, but to
seek a place where they could still labor for the salvation of souls."—The
Desire of Ages, page 355.

    THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
Southern African Division—September 28, 1946
    In no part of the world are the efforts of consecrated men and women
more productive of soul winning than in Africa, once known as the Dark Con-
tinent, but now as the Continent of Great Opportunity. Even those with little
education engage in giving the gospel message. South Africa appeals strongly
for the establishing of two training schools, one in the Congo Union and the
other in Uganda, which are shaded on the map. The future of the work in
Africa depends on building up strong, well-staffed institutions where our Afri-
can young people can receive the best training possible to prepare for the
Lord's work. The overflow of the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering on September
28, will, therefore, be devoted to establishing these two schools.
    When we last gave to South Africa, the first quarter of 1944, the overflow
amounted to $28,558.28. This was greatly appreciated by the workers in that
field, and went toward the extension of the third angel's message in Tangan-
yika. Will you not this present quarter work toward a generous offering on
the thirteenth Sabbath that African young people may have a training for
gospel work?
