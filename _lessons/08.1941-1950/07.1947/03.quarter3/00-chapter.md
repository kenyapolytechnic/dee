with daily review or illustration during the week. Thus the lesson will become fixed in
the memory, a treasure never to be wholly lost."—"Education," pages 251, 252.

   THE LIFE AND TEACHINGS OF JESUS


                      Lesson 1, for July 5, 1947
                 "In Remembrance of Me"
   LESSON SCRIPTURES: 1 Cor. 11:23-26; Matt. 26:26-35; John 13:21-33.
   MEMORY VERSE: "For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye
do show the Lord's death till He come." 1 Cor. 11:26.
   STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pages 652-661.

                          The Lord's Supper
   1. While eating the Passover supper.with His disciples, what
memorial of His great sacrifice did Jesus establish? 1 Cor. 11:23-26.
   NoTE.—"Christ was standing at the point of transition between two
economies and their two great festivals. He, the spotless Lamb of God, was
about to present Himself as a sin offering, and He would thus bring to an
end the system of types and ceremonies that for four thousand years had
pointed to His death. As He ate the Passover with His disciples, He instituted
in its place the service that was to be the memorial of His great sacrifice.
The national festival of the Jews was to pass away forever. The service
which Christ established was to be observed by His followers in all lands
and through all ages. . . .
   "Christ is still at the table on which the paschal supper has been spread.
The unleavened cakes used at the Passover season are before Him. The
Passover wine, untouched by fermentation, is on the table. These emblems
Christ employs to represent His own unblemished sacrifice. Nothing cor-
rupted by fermentation, the symbol of sin and death, could represent the
`Lamb without blemish and without spot.' "—The Desire of Ages, pages
652, 653.

  2. Having taken the bread, what did Jesus do? What did He
say concerning the bread which He broke? Matt. 26:26 (margin);
1 Cor. 11:24.

   3. Setting before them yet another emblem, how did He explain
its significance? How many were to partake of it? Matt. 26:27,
28; Mark 14:23; 1 Cor. 11:25, 26.
   NOTE.—The King James version of Matthew 26:27 reads: "Drink ye all
of it." Some have taken the word translated "all" to refer to the cup.
Literally, in the Greek, it reads, "Drink ye all from it," and the "all" is
masculine gender, nominative case, plural number, to agree with "ye" in the
imperative "drink ye." This is in harmony with Mark who says: "They all
                                    [3 1
drank of it." Mark 14:23. It is quite impossible for "all" to agree with "it,"
which is neuter gender, partitive genitive case, singular number. The "ye"
and "all" undoubtedly refer to the disciples, who represent in Matthew 27 the
"many" for whom Christ's blood was poured out. Verse 28.
   "When believers assemble to celebrate the ordinances, there are present
messengers unseen by human eyes. . . . Christ by the Holy Spirit is there
to set the seal to His own ordinance. He is there to convict and soften the
heart. Not a look, not a thought of contrition, escapes His notice."—The
Desire of Ages, page 656.
   4. What did the apostle Paul say the Communion cup repre-
sented? Until what time? 1 Cor. 11:25, 26; Matt. 26:29.
   NoTE.—"The Communion service points to Christ's second coming. It was
designed to keep this hope vivid in the minds of the disciples. Whenever
they met together to commemorate His death, they recounted how 'He took
the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;
for this is My blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the
remission of sins. But I say unto you; I will not drink henceforth of this
fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in My Father's
kingdom.' In their tribulation they found comfort in the hope of their Lord's
return."—The Desire of Ages, page 659.
                        The Betrayer Revealed
  5. While at the table, what shocking disclosure did Jesus make?
John 13:21; Matt. 26:21.

   6. How did these words of Jesus affect the disciples? What
question did they ask? Matt. 26:22.
   NOTE.—"At these words amazement and consternation seized them. They
could not comprehend how any one of them could deal treacherously with
their divine Teacher. For what cause could they betray Him? and to whom?
Whose heart could give birth to such a desire? Surely not one of the favored
twelve, who had been privileged above all others to hear His teachings, who
had shared His wonderful love, and for whom He had shown such great
regard by bringing them into close communion with Himself !"—The Desire
of Ages, page 654.

   7. What did Peter beckon John to do? John 13:23, 24.
   8. How did John carry out Peter's request? How did Jesus iden-
tify His betrayer? John 13:25, 26.

  9. What question did Judas ask? How did Jesus answer him?
What did some of the disciples think Jesus meant? Matt. 26:25;
John 13:27-29.
  10. Having received the sop, what did Judas do? What time
was it? John 13:30.
  NOTE.—"In surprise and confusion at the exposure of his purpose, Judas
rose hastily to leave the room. . . . Until this step was taken, Judas
had not passed beyond the possibility of repentance. But when he left the
                                  [4 ]
presence of his Lord and his fellow disciples, the final decision had been made.
He had passed the boundary line."—The Desire of Ages, page 654.
                The Father Glorified in His Son
  11. When Judas had departed, what declaration did Jesus make?
John 13:31, 32.
  12. With what words of tender regard did Jesus then address
His disciples? How did He speak of His departure? John 13:33:
  13. What new commandment did Jesus now give His disciples?
What will convince the world that we are truly His disciples?
John 13:34, 35.
   NOTE.—"Supreme love fbr God and unselfish love for one another,—this is
the best gift that our heavenly Father can bestow. This love is not an im-
pulse, but a divine principle, a permanent power. The unconsecrated heart
cannot originate or produce it. Only in the heart where Jesus reigns is it
found."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 551.
  14. How was the Communion service closed? Matt. 26:30,
margin.
                      Peter's Great Peril
  15. While they were on their way to the Mount of Olives, what
did Jesus reveal to His disciples concerning themselves? Matt.
26:31, 32.
16. In what words did Peter declare his loyalty to his Master?
Matt. 26:33.
   17. What prediction did Jesus make? In what words did Peter
again assert his loyalty? What was the attitude of the other
disciples? Matt. 26:34, 35.
   NoTE.—"When Peter said he would follow his Lord to prison and to
death, he meant it, every word of it; but he did not know himself. Hidden
in his heart were elements of evil that circumstances would fan into life.
Unless he was made conscious of his danger, these would prove his eternal
ruin. The Saviour saw in him a self-love and assurance that would overbear
even his love for Christ."—The Des-ire of Ages, pages 673, 674.


                      Lesson 2, for July 12, 1947
        Our Blessed Hope; Our Mighty Helper
   LESSON SCRIPTURE: John 14:1-30.
   MEMORY VERSE: "Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe
also in Me. In My Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would
have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for
you, I will come again, and receive you unto Myself; that where I am,' there ye may
be also." John 14:1-3.
   STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pages 662-672.
                                        [6 l
                     Many Mansions in Preparation
   1. Having spoken of His departure, what message of hope and
courage and confidence did Jesus bring to His sorrowful disciples?
John 14:1-4.
   NOTE.—"The object of Christ's departure was the opposite of what the
disciples feared. It did not mean a final separation. He was going to prepare
a place for them, that He might come again, and receive them unto Himself.
While He was building mansions for them, they were to build characters
after the divine similitude."—The Desire of Ages, page 663.
  2. For what had Abraham and all the ancient worthies looked?
What was John in holy vision permitted to behold? Heb. 11:8, 10,
16; Rev. 21:1, 2, 10, 18.
   3. What is promised to the overcomer? Rev. 21:7, margin, "these
things."
                      Jesus the Way of Life
   4. What  question troubled Thomas? What further revelation of
truth did Jesus make? John 14:5, 6.
   5. What statement did Jesus make concerning His unity with
the Father? What did Philip then say to Jesus? John 14:7, 8.
   NoTE.—"Christ had not ceased to be God when He became man. Though
He had humbled Himself to humanity, the Godhead was still His own. Christ
alone could represent the Father to humanity, and this representation the
disciples had been privileged to behold for over three years."—The Desire
of Ages, pages 663, 664.
   6. Continuing His statement concerning His oneness with the
Father, what did Jesus say? John 14:9-11.
   NOTE.—"If the disciples believed this vital connection between the Father
and the Son, their faith would not forsake them when they saw Christ's
suffering and death to save a perishing world. . . .
   "As Christ was speaking these words, the glory of God was shining from
His countenance, and all present felt a sacred awe as they listened with rapt
attention to His words. Their hearts were more decidedly drawn to Him;
and as they were drawn to Christ in greater love, they were drawn to one
another."—The Desire of Ages, page 664.

   7. What will those do who believe on Jesus? What basis did
He give for this promise? John 14:12-14.
   NOTE.—"Jesus revealed no qualities, and exercised no powers, that men
may not have through faith in Him. His perfect humanity is that which all
His followers may possess, if they will be in subjection to God as He was.
  " 'And greater works than these shall he do ; because I go unto My Father.'
By this Christ did not mean that the disciples' work would be of a more
exalted character than His, but that it would have greater extent. He did
not refer merely to miracle working, but to all that would take place under
the working of the Holy Spirit."—The Desire of Ages, pages 664, 667.
                                     [8 ]
                    The Abiding Comforter
  8. What earnest appeal did Jesus make to all who profess to love
Him? To those who heed this appeal, what wonderful promise did
He make? John 14:15, 16.
9. What divine companionship was promised to the disciples?
Whom would He represent? John 14:17-20.
 NOTE.—"The Holy Spirit is Christ's representative, but divested of the per-
sonality of humanity, and independent thereof. Cumbered with humanity,
Christ could not be in every place personally. Therefore it was for their interest
that He should go to the Father, and send the Spirit to be His successor on
earth. No one could then have any advantage because of his location or his
personal contact with Christ. By the Spirit the Saviour would be accessible
to all. In this sense He would be nearer to them than if He had not ascended
on high."—The Desire of Ages, page 669.

  10. How is true love for Jesus manifested? What will be the
experience of the obedient? What is said of one who does not love
Him? John 14:21-24.
                      The Divine Teacher
  11. What did Jesus say the Holy Spirit would do for His people?
John 14:26.
  NOTE.—"The Holy Spirit was the highest of all gifts that He [Jesus]
could solicit from His Father for the exaltation of His people. The Spirit
was to be given as a regenerating agent, and without this the sacrifice of
Christ would have been of no avail. The power of evil had been strengthen-
ing for centuries, and the submission of men to this satanic captivity was
amazing. Sin could be resisted and overcome only through the mighty agency
of the Third Person of the Godhead, who would come with no modified
energy, but in the fullness of divine power. It is the Spirit that makes effec-
tual what has been wrought out by the world's Redeemer. It is by the Spirit
that the heart is made pure."—The Desire of Ages, page 671.

                         Perfect Peace
  12. What is Christ's legacy to every true believer? By way of
comfort and assurance what did He add? John 14:27; Phil. 4:7.
  NOTE.—"Inward peace and a conscience void of offense toward God, will
quicken and invigorate the intellect, like dew distilled upon the tender plants."
—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 327.

  13. To what coming event did Jesus again refer? For what reason
should they rejoice? John 14:28.
  14. Why did Jesus tell His disciples these things before they
occurred?. Of whose coming did He warn them? John 14:29-31.
   NorE.--PSatan is constantly at work; but few have any idea of his
activity and subtlety. The people of God must be prepared to withstand the
wily foe. It is this resistance that Satan dreads. He knows better than we
do the limit of his power, and how easily he can be overcome if we resist and
                                       7
face him. Through divine strength, the weakest saint is more than a match
for him and all his angels, and if brought to the test, he would be able to
prove his superior power. Therefore Satan's step is noiseless, his movements
stealthy, and his batteries masked: He does not venture to show himself
openly, lest he arouse the Christian's dormant energies, and send him to God
in prayer."—Testimonies, vol. 5, pp. 293, 294.



                      Lesson 3, for July 19, 1947
 The Heavenly Vine; a Most Wonderful Prayer
   LESSON SCRIPTURES: John 15; 17.
   MEMORY VERSE: "If ye keep My commandments, ye shall abide in My
love; even as I have kept My Father's commandments, and abide in His love." John
15:10.
   STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pages 674-680.

                      The Vine and the Branches
  1. What figure of speech did Jesus employ to represent the
spiritual relationship of the disciples to Him? What did He say of
His Father? In the symbol what do the branches repre,sent? John
15:1, 5 (first part).

   2. What is done with every unfruitful branch? With every fruit-
ful one? What must the branch do to bear fruit? What will be
the result of abiding in Jesus and He in us? John 15:2-5.
   NOTE. "Can we conceive of a closer, more intimate relation to Christ than
is set forth in the words, 'I am the vine, ye are the branches'? The fibers of
the branch are almost identical with those of the vine. The communication
of life, strength, and fruitfulness from the trunk to the branches is unob-
structed and constant. The root sends its nourishment through the branch.
Such is the true believer's relation to Christ. He abides in Christ, and draws
his nourishment from Him."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 229.

   3. What is the result of a failure to abide in Christ? What un-
limited possibilities are attainable by abiding in Him? How may
we best glorify the Father? John 15:6-8.
   NOTE.—"Jesus with solemn tenderness explained the purpose of the hus-
bandman. The pruning will cause pain, but it is the Father who applies the
knife. He works with no wanton hand or indifferent heart. There are
branches trailing upon the ground; these must be cut loose from the earthly
supports to which their tendrils are fastening. They are to reach heaven-
ward, and find their support in God. The excessive foliage that draws away
the life current from the fruit must be pruned off. The overgrowth must be
cut out, to give room for the healing beams of the Sun of Righteousness.
The husbandman prunes away the harmful growth, that the fruit may be
richer and more abundant."—The Desire of Ages, page 677.
                                     [8
                       Love Revealed
  4. What is the measure of Christ's love for us? How only may
we abide in His love? What comparison does He make? John
15:9, 10.

  5. Why did Jesus tell His disciples these things? What com-
mandment did He repeat? What is the strongest proof one can give
of his love for another? John 15:11-13.

   6. In defining their relationship to Him, how did Christ con-
trast friendship and servitude? John 15:14, 15.
   IsloTE.—"Feelings are often deceiving, emotions are no sure safeguard; for
they are variable and subject to external circumstances. Many are deluded by
relying on sensational impressions. The test is, What are you doing for
Christ? What sacrifices are you making? What victories are you gaining?
A selfish spirit overcome, a temptation to neglect duty resisted, passion
subdued, and willing, cheerful obedience rendered to the will of Christ, is far
greater evidence that you are a child of God than spasmodic piety and emo-
tional religion."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 188.

                    Secret of Fruit Bearing
  7. For what purpose has the Lord chosen us and sent us into the
world? What assurance of help is given those who ask of the
Father in His name? John 15:16.
   NorE.—"Humble workers, who do not trust in their own strength, but
who labor in simplicity, trusting always in God, will share in the joy of
the Saviour. Their persevering prayers will bring souls to the cross. In co-
operation with their self-sacrificing efforts, Jesus will move upon hearts,
working miracles in the conversion of souls. Men and women will be
gathered into church fellowship. Meetinghouses will be built, and schools
established. The hearts of the workers will be filled with joy as they see the
salvation of God."—Testimonies, vol. 7, pp. 27, 28.

  8. What witnesses did Jesus say would bear testimony in His
behalf? John 15:26, 27.
  NOTE.—"After the descent of the Holy Spirit, the disciples were so filled
with love for Him and for those for whom He died, that hearts were melted
by the words they spoke and the prayers they offered. They spoke in the
power of the Spirit; and under the influence of that power, thousands were
converted."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 22.

                     A Wonderful Prayer
  9. While-in the shadow of Gethsemane, what prayer did Jesus
offer? What were the opening words of His prayer? John 17:1.
  10. What power had the Father given to His Son? For what
purpose? How is eternal life defined? John 17:2, 3.
                                      [9)
   NOTE.—"In His prayer to the Father, Christ gave to the world a lesson
which should be graven on mind and soul. . . . The experimental knowledge
of God and of Jesus Christ whom He has sent, transforms man into the
image of God. It gives to man the mastery of himself, bringing every impulse
and passion of the lower nature under the control of the higher powers of the
mind. It makes its possessor a son of God and an heir of heaven. It brings
him into communion with the mind of the Infinite, and opens to him the rich
treasures of the universe."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 114.

   11. What two things did Jesus then say He had accomplished?
For what did He pray? What did He say of those whom His
Father had given Him? John 17:4-8.
   NoTE.—"Man cannot show greater weakness than by allowing men to
ascribe to him the honor for gifts that are Heaven-bestowed. . . . It is
when we are faithful in exalting the name of God that our impulses are
under divine supervision, and we are enabled to develop spiritual and intel-
lectual power."—Prophets and Kings, pages 68, 69.

                     Interceding for His People
  12. For whom did Jesus pray? For what special reason did He
pray in behalf of His people? While with them, what had He done
for them? Who was the only exception? John 17:9-12.

  13. What had Jesus given to His disciples? In consequence how
had the world regarded them? For what reason? While they
remained in the world, what was the burden of His prayer? John
17:13-16.

   14. What is the source of Bible sanctification? Into what service
had Jesus sent His disciples? For what purpose did Jesus sanctify
Himself? For whom besides those present did He pray? John
17:17-20.
   NoTE.—"Christ abiding in the heart shines out in the faces of those who
love Him and keep His commandments. Truth is written there. The sweet
peace of heaven is revealed. There is expressed a habitual gentleness, a more
than human love. . . .
   "Man with his human nature becomes a partaker of divinity. Christ is
honored in excellence and perfection of character. As these changes are
effected, angels break forth in rapturous song, and God and Christ rejoice
over souls fashioned after the divine similitude."—Christ's Object Lessons,
page 102.

15. For what measure of unity among His people did Jesus pray?
Where such perfect unity exists, what will follow? John 17:21-23.

  16. What special request did Jesus then make in behalf of His
children? What did Jesus say He would continue to do? John
17:24-26.

                    Sin Being Laid on Jesus
  1. After praying for all His disciples, where did Jesus go with
the eleven? John 18:1.

    2. Having entered the garden, what did Jesus say to them?
Whom did He take with Him farther into the garden? What great
change came over the Master? In His deep sorrow what request
did He make of the three? Matt. 26:36-38.
    Nom.—"Jesus had been earnestly conversing with His disciples and in-
structing them; but as He neared Gethsemane, He became strangely silent.
. . . Now He seemed to be shut out from the light of God's sustaining pres-
ence.' Now He was numbered with the transgressors. The guilt of fallen
humanity He must bear. Upon Him who knew no sin must be laid the
iniquity of us all. So dreadful does sin appear to Him, so great is the weight
of guilt which He must bear, that He is tempted to fear it will shut Him out
forever from His Father's love. Feeling how terrible is the wrath of God
against transgression, He exclaims, 'My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even
unto death.' "—The Desire of Ages, page 685.

                       Under the Load of Guilt
   3. Going a little distance from His closest companions, what
prayer did Jesus offer? Matt. 26:39.
   NoTE.—"Behold Him contemplating the price to be paid for the human
soul. In His agony He clings to the cold ground, as if to prevent Himself
from being drawn farther from God. The chilling dew of night falls upon
His prostrate form, but He heeds it not. From His pale lips comes the bitter
cry, '0 My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from Me.' Yet even
now He adds, 'Nevertheless not as I will, but as Thou wilt!"—The Desire
of Ages, page 687.

   4. Returning to the three disciples, what did Jesus find? What
question did He ask Peter? What more did He say to him? Matt.
26:40, 41.
   NOTE.—"The One who had always had words of sympathy for them was
now suffering superhuman agony, and He longed to know that they were
praying for Him and for themselves. How dark seemed the malignity of sin !
Terrible was the temptation to let the human race bear the consequences of
its own guilt, while He stood innocent before God. If He could only know
that His disciples _understood and appreciated this, He would be strength-
ened."—The Desire of Ages, pages 687, 688.
                                      111
  5. Leaving His disciples the second time, with what words did
Jesus pray? Returning, what did He find? Matt. 26:42, 43.

   6. As the Saviour prayed the third time, how was He strengthened
to meet this crisis hour? How was the intensity of His praying
shown? Matt. 26:44; Luke 22:41-44.
    NOTE.—"God suffered with His Son. Angels beheld the Saviour's agony.
They saw their. Lord enclosed by legions of satanic forces, His nature weighed
down with a shuddering, mysterious dread. There was silence in heaven. No
harp was touched. Could mortals have viewed the amazement of the angelic
host as in silent grief they watched the Father separating His beams of light,
love, and glory from His beloved Son, they would better understand how
offensive in His sight is sin. . . .
    "Angels had longed to bring relief to the divine Sufferer, but this might
not be. No way of escape was found for the Son of God. In this awful crisis,
when everything was at stake, when the mysterious cup trembled in the hand
 of the Sufferer, the heavens opened, a light shone forth amid the stormy dark-
ness of the crisis hour, and the mighty angel who stands in God's presence,
occupying the position from which Satan fell, came to the side of Christ.
The angel came not to take the cup from Christ's hand, but to strengthen
Him to drink it, with the assurance of the Father's love. He came to give
power to the divine-human suppliant."—The Desire of Ages, page 693.

   7. Returning to the disciples, what did He say to them? What
tragic event was at hand? What did He bid them do? Matt.
26:45, 46.
   NorE.—"The sleeping disciples had been suddenly awakened by the light
surrounding the Saviour. They saw the angel bending over their prostrate
Master. They saw him lift the Saviour's head upon his bosom, and point
toward heaven. They heard his voice, like sweetest music, speaking words
of comfort and hope. The disciples recalled the scene upon the mount of
transfiguration. They remembered the glory that in the temple had encircled
Jesus, and the voice of God that spoke from the cloud. Now that same glory
was again revealed, and they had no further fear for their Master."—The
 Desire of Ages, page 694.

                  The Betrayer Leads a Mob
  8. Who  then appeared  on the scene? What preparation for the
use of violence had been made? By what sign was Jesus to be
pointed out? Matt. 26:47-49.

9. What did Jesus know in advance? What did He do and say?
What conversation followed? John 18:4, 5.

                        Divine Glory Revealed
   10. When Jesus revealed His identity, what occurred? John 1.8:6.
   NOTE.—"As these words were spoken, the angel who had lately ministered
to Jesus moved between Him and the mob. A divine light illuminated the
Saviour's face, and a dovelike form overshadowed Him. -In the presence of
this divine glory, the murderous throng could not stand for a moment. They
                                     [12 3
staggered back. Priests, elders, soldiers, and even Judas, fell as dead men to
the ground.
   "The angel withdrew, and the light faded away. Jesus had opportunity
to escape, but He remained, calm and self-possessed. As one glorified He
stood in the midst of that hardened band, now prostrate and helpless at His
feet. The disciples looked on, silent with wonder and awe."—The Desire of
Ages, page 694.
  11. When the glory disappeared, what question - did Jesus ask
the mob, and what was their reply? What did He then say to them?
John 18:7, 8.
                       The Conspiracy Develops
   12. What did Jesus say to Judas? What action followed? Matt.
26:50; John 18:10; Luke 22:51.
   NOTE.—"The disciples had thought that their Master would not suffer
Himself to be taken. For the same power that had caused the mob to fall
as dead men could keep them helpless, until Jesus and His companions should
escape. They were disappointed and indignant as they saw the cords brought
forward to bind the hands of Him whom they loved."—The Desire of Ages,
page 696.

  13. After Peter's blow with the sword, what did Jesus say to
him? Why did He not seek deliverance by means of angel guard-
ians? Matt. 26:53, 54.

  14. What did Jesus then say to the multitude? Why did He
permit Himself to be thus cruelly treated? What, then, did all the
disciples do? What had He previously told them? Matt. 26:55, 56;
John 16:32.



                     Lesson 5, for August 2, 1947
             Jesus Before Annas and Caiaphas
     LESSON SCRIPTURES: John 18:12-27; Matt. 26:57-73; Mark 14:55-59,
68, 71, 72.
     MEMORY VERSE: "He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows,
 and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from Him; He was de-
 spised, and we esteemed. Him not." Isa. 53:3.
     STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pages 698-713.

                    Jesus Before Annas
   1. From Gethsemane to what place was Jesus taken by His cap-
 tors? John 18:12-14.
    NorE.—"Jesus was first led to the mansion of Hannas, the head of the
 reigning priestly family, either in deference to his recognized influence, or
 because, as the oldest high priest, he was still recognized as the rightful, if
                                      [13 )
not legal, dignitary. He could see Jesus, and hear His defense, and advise his
son-in-law how to act. His 'snakelike' craft might help the less acute
Caiaphas."—Cunningham Geikie, Life and Words of Christ, vol. 2, ch. 60.
  2. When Jesus was placed on trial, what question did Annas ask
Him? In His reply how did Jesus contrast His own manner of
work with the methods of His accusers? John 18:19-21.

   3. How did an officer standing by express his resentment of Jesus'
reply? How did Jesus calmly answer him? John 18:22, 23.
   Noss.—"Christ suffered keenly under abuse and insult. At the hands of
the beings whom He had created, and for whom He was making an infinite
sacrifice, He received every indignity. And He suffered in proportion to the
perfection of His holiness and His hatred of sin. His trial by men who acted
as fiends was to Him a perpetual sacrifice. To be surrounded by human
beings under the control of Satan was revolting to Him."—The Desire of
Ages, page 700.
                   Jesus Before Caiaphas
  4. Where was Jesus next taken? Who were assembled at the
house of Caiaphas? John 18:24; Matt. 26:57.

   5. What evil purpose did the council ruthlessly endeavor to
accomplish? How successful were they? What false charge was
later brought against Jesus? Matt. 26:59-61; Mark 14:55-59.
   NorE.—"Early in His ministry Christ had said, 'Destroy this temple, and
in three days I will raise it up' In the figurative language of prophecy, He
had thus foretold His own death and resurrection. 'He spake of the temple
of His body' These words the Jews had understood in a literal sense, as
referring to the temple at Jerusalem. Of all that Christ had said, the priests
could find nothing to use ap. inst Him save this. By misstating these words
they hoped to gain an advantage. The Romans had engaged in rebuilding
and embellishing the temple, and they took great pride in it; any contempt
shown to it 'would be sure to excite their indignation. Here Romans and
Jews, Pharisees and Sadducees, could meet; for all held the temple in great
veneration."—The Desire of Ages, pages 705, 706.

                          Inhuman Treatment
                                                                      •
   6. What did the high priest say to Jesus? When Jesus refused
to speak in self-defense, how did the high priest solemnly adjure
Him? What answer did Jesus give? Matt. 26:62-64, first part.
   NOTE.—"To this appeal Christ could not remain silent. There was a time
to be silent,. and a time to speak. He had not spoken until directly questioned.
He knew that to answer now would make His death certain, but the appeal
was made by the highest acknowledged authority of the nation, and in the
name of the Most High. Christ would not fail to show proper respect for the
law. More than this, His own relation to the Father was called in question.
He must plainly declare His character and mission. Jesus had said to His
disciples, 'Whosoever therefore shall confess Me before men, him will I con-
                                     [14]
fess also before My Father which is in heaven.' Now by His own example
He repeated the lesson. Every ear was bent to listen, and every eye was
fixed on His face as He answered, 'Thou hast said.' "—The Desire of Ages,
pages 706, 707.

  7. What did Jesus declare they should see? In his fury what did
the high priest do? What did he say? When he appealed to the
council for a decision, what was their verdict? Matt. 26:64 (last
part), 65, 66.
   NOTE.—"For a moment the divinity of Christ flashed through His guise
of humanity. The high priest quailed before the penetrating eyes of the
Saviour. That look seemed to read his hidden thoughts, and burn into his
heart. Never in afterlife did he forget that searching glance of the perse-
cuted Son of God."--The Desire of Ages, page 707.

  8. What cruel treatment did Jesus then receive? Matt. 26:67, 68.
   NorE.—`,`The Saviour was now treated as a condemned criminal, and given
up to be abused by the lowest and vilest of humankind. The palace of the
high priest surrounded an open court in which the soldiers and the multitude
had gathered. Through this court, Jesus was taken to the guardroom, on
every side meeting with mockery of His claim to be the Son of God. . . .
Never was criminal treated in so inhuman a manner as was the Son of God."
—The Desire of Ages, page 710.

  9. When Jesus was taken to the high priest's house for trial, what
did Peter and another disciple do? To whom was that other dis-
ciple known? Relate Peter's experience in finding entrance. John
18:15, 16.
  10. What question was asked of Peter as he entered the court of
the palace? By whom? How did Peter reply? John 18:17.
  11. With whom did Peter mingle as he stood near the fire? As
he went out into the porch, what occurred? John 18:18; Mark
14:67, 68.
12. What did another maid say of Peter when she saw him?
How did he seek to emphasize his denial? Matt. 26:71, 72.
  13. A little later what did one of those who stood by say to
Peter? Who was one of those who brought the charge? Where
had he seen him? Matt. 26:73; John 18:26.
  14. How did Peter then seek to give force to his denial? What
occurred immediately? Mark 14:71; John 18:27.
   NoTE.—"The disciples of Jesus were noted for the purity of their language,
and in order fully to deceive his questioners, and justify his assumed char-
acter, Peter now denied his Master with cursing and swearing."—The Desire
of Ages, page 712.
                                    I 1.6 ]
   15. At this time what did the Lord do? What did this experience
bring to Peter's mind? What did he then do? Luke 22:61, 62;
Mark 14:72.
   NoTE.—"He [Peter] reflected with horror upon his own ingratitude, his
falsehood, his perjury. Once more he looked at his Master, and saw a sacrile-
gious hand raised to smite Him in the face. Unable longer to endure the scene,
he rushed, heartbroken, from the hall.
   "He pressed on in solitude and darkness, he knew not and cared not
whither. . . . On the very spot where Jesus bad poured out His soul in
agony to His Father, Peter fell upon his face, and wished that he might die.
It was in sleeping when Jesus bade him watch and pray that Peter had pre-
pared the way for his great sin. . . . Had those hours in the garden been
spent in watching and prayer, Peter would not have been left to depend upon
his own feeble strength."—Te Desire of Ages, page 713.



                     Lesson 6, for August 9, 1947

The Son of God Before the Sanhedrin and Pilate
   LESSON SCRIPTURES: Luke 22:66-71; Matt. 27:3-8; John 18:28-38.
   MEMORY VERSE: "Pilate saith unto Him, What is truth? And when h. had
said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in Hi.. no
fault at all." John 18:38.
   STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pages 714-728.

                       Jesus Before the Sanhedrin
   1. At the dawning of the day following the trials before Annas
and Caiaphas, where was Jesus taken? Luke 22:66.
   NoTE.—"There were three trials of Christ before the Jewish a..thorities,
(1) in the middle of the night, before Annas, (2) also in the night, before
Caiaphas and a hastily summoned portion of the Sanhedrin, and (3) soon
after sunrise the next day, before the full Sanhedrin, or at least a quorum.
At these trials our Lord was condemned on the charge of blasphemy, pun-
ishable by death; but all the trials were illegal, for no trial could lawfully
be held at night, nor could a criminal be condemned to death on the day of
his trial."—Peloubet's Select Notes, 1931, page 170.

   2. What question did the Sanhedrin ask Jesus? What was His
reply? Luke 22:67.
   NOTE.—The "council" or Sanhedrin was the chief legislative and judicial
body of the Jews. It had seventy-one members, including the high priest,
who was its president.
   "The trial must be so conducted as to unite the members of the Sanhedrin
against Christ. There were two charges which the priests desired, to main-
tain. If Jesus could be proved a blasphemer, He would be condemned by
the Jews. If convicted of sedition, it would secure His condemnation by the
Romans."—The Desire of Ages, page 699.
                                      f16]
   3. What additional statement did Jesus make regarding their
attitude? That they might be left without excuse, what solemn
warning did He give? Luke 22:68, 69.
   NOTE.—"That they might be left without excuse He added the solemn
warning, 'Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power
of God' . .
   "The angels of God faithfully recorded every insulting look, word, and
act against their beloved Commander. One day the base men who scorned
and spat upon the calm, pale face of Christ will look upon it in its glory,
shining brighter than the sun."—The Desire of Ages, pages 714, 715.
   4. With one voice what pointed question did the Sanhedrin ask
Jesus? In His reply how did He confess His relationship to God?
In what words did they then pronounce sentence against Him?
Luke 22:70, 71.
   NorE.—"When the condemnation of Jesus was pronounced by the judges, a
satanic fury took possession of the people. The roar of voices was like that of
wild beasts. The crowd made a rush toward Jesus, crying, He is guilty, put
Him to death! Had it not been for the Roman soldiers, Jesus would not have
lived to be nailed to the cross of Calvary. He would have been torn in pieces
before His judges, had not Roman authority interfered, and by force of arms
restrained the violence of the mob.
   "Heathen men were angry at the brutal treatment of one against whom
nothing had been proved. The Roman officers declared that the Jews in
pronouncing condemnation upon Jesus were infringing upon the Roman
power, and that it was even against the Jewish law to condemn a man to
death upon his own testimony. This intervention brought a momentary lull
in the proceedings; but the Jewish leaders were dead alike to pity and to
shame."—The Desire of Ages, pages 714, 715.

     •                Judas Makes a Fatal Choice
   5. When Judas saw that Jesus was condemned, what did he do?
What cruel deed did he confess? What sarcastic reply did he
receive? Matt. 27:3, 4.
   NorE.—Instead of the words, "repented himself," Weymouth's translation
reads, "smitten with remorse."
   6. In his despair what did Judas do? Matt. 27:5.
   NorE.—"Judas saw that his entreaties were in vain, and he rushed from
the hall exclaiming, It is too late It is too late ! He felt that he could not
live to see Jesus crucified, and in despair went out and hanged himself."—The
Desire of Ages, page 722.
  7. What did the priests say of the betrayal money? What did
they do with it? What name was given to the field purchased with
the price of blood? Matt. 27:6-8; Acts 1:15-19.
           First Appearance of Jesus Before Pilate
  8. Following His condemnation by the Sanhedrin, where was
Jesus taken? Luke 23:1; John 18:28.
                              [ 17 1
    NOTE.—"After condemning Jesus, the council of the Sanhedrin had come
to Pilate to have the sentence confirmed and executed. But these Jewish
officials would not enter the Roman judgment hall. According to their
ceremonial law they would be defiled thereby, and thus prevented from taking
part in the feast of the Passover. In their blindness they did not see that
murderous hatred had defiled their hearts. They did not see that Christ was
the real Passover lamb, and that, since they had, rejected Him, the great
feast had for them lost its significance.
   "When the Saviour was brought into the judgment hall, Pilate looked
upon Him with no friendly eyes. The Roman governor had been called from
his bedchamber in haste, and he determined to do his work as quickly as
possible. He was prepared to deal with the prisoner with magisterial sever-
ity."—The Desire of Ages, page 723.

  9. As the Jews would not enter the judgment hall lest they be
defiled, what did Pilate do? What question did he ask the mem-
bers of the Sanhedrin? What was their answer? John 18:29, 30.
  10. What did Pilate then tell them to do? What reply did the
Jews make? What statement concerning the manner of Jesus' death
was thus fulfilled? John 18:31, 32; Matt. 20:19.
   NOTE.—"If your judgment is sufficient, he said, why bring the prisoner to
me? 'Take ye Him, and judge Him according to your law.' Thus pressed,
the priests said that they had already passed sentence upon Him, but that
they must have Pilate's sentence to render their condemnation valid. What
is your sentence? Pilate asked. The death sentence, they answered; but it is
not lawful for us to put any man to death. They asked Pilate to take their
word as to Christ's guilt, and enforce their sentence. They would take the
responsibility of the result."—The Desire of Ages, page 725.

  11. What accusations against Jesus were then made to Pilate?
Addressing Jesus, what direct question did Pilate ask? Whai was
the reply? Luke 23:2, 3.
  12. Calling Jesus for a private interview, what question did
Pilate ask? What was Jesus' reply? What further question did
Pilate ask? John 18:33-35.
   NoTE.—"Hoping to gain the truth from Him and to escape the tumult of
the crowd, Pilate took Jesus aside with him, and again questioned, 'Art Thou
the King of the Jews?' Jesus did not directly answer this question. He knew
that the Holy Spirit was striving with Pilate, and He gave him opportunity
to acknowledge his conviction."—The Desire of Ages, page 726.

  13. What did Jesus say to Pilate regarding the nature of His
kingdom? Again what question did Pilate ask concerning His
kingship? In His reply what did Jesus say regarding His mission
to the world? John 18:36, 37.

             September 27, 1947—China Division
                                   [181
   14. What additional question did Pilate ask? Going outside,
what report did he give to the Jews concerning Jesus? John 18:38.
   NOTE.—"Pilate had a desire to know the truth. His mind was confused.
He eagerly grasped the words of the Saviour, and his heart was stirred with
a great longing to know what it really was, and how he could obtain it.
`What is truth?' he inquired. But he did not wait for an answer. The tumult
outside recalled him to the interests of the hour; for the priests were clam-
orous for immediate action. Going out to the Jews, he declared emphatically,
`I find in Him no fault at all.' "-7The Desire of Ages, page 727.



                   Lesson '7, for August 16, 1947

              Jesus Before Herod and Pilate
   LESSON SCRIPTURES: Luke 23:4-24; Matt. 27:15-26.
   MEMORY VERSE: "Surely He hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows:
yet we did esteem Him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted." Isa. 53:4.
   STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pages 729-733.

                          Jesus Before Herod
  1. After Pilate had declared, "I find no fault in this Man," what
did the Jews furiously state? What question did Pilate then ask?
Luke 23:4-6.

   2. To whom did Pilate send Jesus? Luke 23:7.
   NOTE.—"Learning that Christ came from Galilee, he [Pilate] sent Him to
the Roman ruler of that province, Herod Antipas, who had murdered John
the Baptist."—Peloubet's Select Notes, 1933, page 170.

   3. What had Herod long desired? What did he now hope to
see? How did Jesus respond to Herod's questions? Luke 23:8, 9.
   NOTE.—"He [Herod] commanded silence, desiring an opportunity to ques-
tion Christ. He ordered that the fetters of Christ should be unloosed, at the
same time charging His enemies with roughly treating Him. Looking with
compassion into the serene face of the world's Redeemer, he read in it only
wisdom and purity. He as well as Pilate was satisfied that Christ had been
accused through malice and envy.
   "Herod questioned Christ in many words, but throughout the Saviour
maintained a profound silence. At the command of the king, the decrepit and
maimed were then called in, and Christ was ordered to prove His claims by
working a miracle. Men say that Thou canst heal the sick, said Herod. I am
anxious to see that Thy widespread fame has not been belied. Jesus did not
respond, and Herod still continued to urge: If Thou canst work miracles
for others, work them now for Thine own good, and it will serve Thee a good
purpose. Again he commanded, Show us a sign that Thou hast the power
with which rumor hath accredited Thee. But Christ was as one who heard
and saw not. The Son of God had taken upon Himself man's nature. He
                                    [19]
must do as man must do in like circumstances. Therefore He would not
work a miracle to save Himself the pain and humiliation that man must
endure when placed in a similar position."—The Desire of Ages, page 729.

   4. What did the chief priests and scribes continue to do? With
what satanic cruelty was Jesus then treated? Following this scene,
where was He sent? Luke 23:10, 11.
   NOTE.—"The Roman soldiers joined in this abuse. All that these wicked,
corrupt soldiers, helped on by Herod and the Jewish dignitaries, could insti-
gate, was heaped upon the Saviour. Yet His divine patience failed not.
   "Christ's persecutors had tried to measure His character by their own;
they had represented Him as vile as themselves. But back of all the present
appearance another scene intruded itself,—a scene which they will one day
see in all its glory. There were some who trembled in Christ's presence.
While the rude throng were bowing in mockery before Him, some who came
forward for that purpose turned back, afraid and silenced. Herod was con-
victed. The last rays of merciful light were shining upon his sin-hardened
heart. He felt that this was no common man; for divinity had flashed
through humanity. At the very time when Christ was encompassed by
mockers, adulterers, and murderers, Herod felt that he was beholding a God
upon His throne."—The Desire of Ages, page 731.

   5. What resulted from Pilate's sending Jesus to Herod? Luke
23:12.
              Jesus' Second Appearance Before Pilate
   6. Having called together the priests and rulers, how did Pilate
summarize his and Herod's findings concerning their charges
against Jesus? To pacify His accusers, what did he say he would
do? Luke 23:13-16.
   NorE.—"Here Pilate showed his weakness. He had declared that Jesus
was innocent, yet he was willing for Him to be scourged to pacify His ac-
cusers. He would sacrifice justice and principle in order to compromise with
the mob. This placed him at a disadvantage. The crowd presumed upon his
indecision, and clamored the more for the life of the prisoner. If at the first
Pilate had stood firm, refusing to condemn a man whom he found guiltless,
he would have broken the fatal chain that was to bind him in remorse and
guilt as long as he lived."—The Desire of Ages, page 732.
  7. While Pilate was wavering between conflicting emotions,
what message of warning came from his wife? Matt. 27:19.
  NOTE.—"Even now Pilate was not left to act blindly. A message from
God warned him from the deed he was about to commit. In answer to
Christ's prayer, the wife of Pilate had been visited by an angel from heaven,
and in a dream she had beheld the Saviour and conversed with Him. Pilate's
wife was not a Jew, but as she looked upon Jesus in her dream, she had no
doubt of His character or mission."—The Desire of Ages, page 732. Read
page 733 also.
  8. While Pilate was still hesitating to act, what custom came to
his mind? Matt. 27:15, 16.
                                1201
  9. For what crimes had Barabbas been imprisoned? Luke 23:18,
19; John 18:40.
   NoTE.—"The Roman authorities at this time held a prisoner named
Barabbas, who was under sentence of death. This man had claimed to be
the Messiah. He claimed authority to establish a different order of things,
to set the world right. Under satanic delusion he claimed that whatever he
could obtain by theft and robbery was his own. He had done wonderful
things through satanic agencies, he had gained a following among the people,
and had excited sedition against the Roman government. Under cover of
religious enthusiasm he was a hardened and desperate villain, bent on rebel-
lion and cruelty."—The Desire of Ages, page 733.

  10. What choice did Pilate now give the Jews? What did he
know to be their motive in delivering Jesus for trial? Matt.
27:17, 18.
   NOTE.-"By giving the people a choice between this man and the inno-
cent Saviour, Pilate thought to arouse them to a sense of justice. He hoped
to gain their sympathy for Jesus in opposition to the priests and rulers. So,
turning to the crowd, he said with great earnestness, 'Whom will ye that I
release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?'"—The Desire
of Ages, page 733.

                 Crucifixion Insistently Demanded
  11. What did the chief priests and the elders persuade the multi-
tude to do? Following this demand, what question did Pilate ask
the second time? Matt. 27:20, 21.

12. Being greatly troubled, what further question did Pilate ask?
What was the unanimous response of the multitude? Matt. 27:22.

  13. Still vainly struggling for the third time to persuade the
people to consent to release Jesus, what question did Pilate ask?
What did the people persistently demand? Matt. 27:23; Luke 23:22.

  14. How did Pilate endeavor to escape from the responsibility
of the blood of Jesus? What was the defiant answer of the people?
Matt. 27:24, 25.
   15. What was Pilate's next step in this terrible tragedy? Luke
23:23, 24; Matt. 27:26.
    NoTE.—"Pilate yielded to the demands of the mob. Rather than risk
 losing his position, he delivered Jesus up to be crucified. But in spite of his
 precautions, the very thing he dreaded afterward came upon him. His honors
 were stripped from him, he was cast down from his high office, and, stung by
 remorse and wounded pride, not long after the crucifixion he ended his own
 life. So all who compromise with sin will gain only sorrow and ruin. 'There
 is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways
 of death.' "—The Desire of Ages, page 738.

                          Extreme Cruelty         •
   1. After Pilate had delivered Jesus to be crucified, to what place
did the soldiers take Him? Matt. 27:27. See margin, "governor's
house."
   2. What were the various steps taken by the soldiers to mock

27:28-30.
                Pilate's Final Examination of Jesus
   3. Following the mock coronation ceremony, what final effort
did Pilate make to release Jesus? With what words did he appeal
to the people in His behalf? John 19:4, 5.
   NOTE.—"Pilate now sent for Barabbas to be brought into the court. He
then presented the two prisoners side by side, and pointing to the Saviour
he said in a voice of solemn entreaty, 'Behold the Man 1"I bring Him forth
to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in Him.'
   "There stood the Son of God, wearing the robe of mockery and the crown
of thorns. Stripped to the waist, His back showed the long, cruel stripes,
from which the blood flowed freely. His face was stained with blood, and
bore the marks of exhaustion and pain-; but never had it appeared more
beautiful than now. The Saviour's visage was not marred before His enemies.
Every feature expressed gentleness and resignation and the tenderest pity for
His cruel foes. In His manner there was no cowardly weakness, but the
strength and dignity of long-suffering. In striking contrast was the prisoner
at His side. Every line of the countenance of Barabbas proclaimed him the
hardened ruffian that he was. The contrast spoke to every beholder. Some of
the spectators were weeping. As they looked upon Jesus, their hearts were
full of sympathy. Even the priests and rulers were convicted that He was all
that He claimed to be."—The Desire of Ages, page 735.
  4. When the priests and officers saw Jesus, what oft-repeated
demand did they make? While confirming the sentence previously
given, what statement did Pilate repeat? John 19:6.
   5. Seeking to relieve themselves of the responsibility for the
terrible crime they were demanding of Pilate, what did they say?

19:9, 10.
                                     [22]
 7. What did Jesus say of the limitation of Pilate's power? Who
must therefore bear the greater sin? John 19:11.
  8. What statement of the Jews appears to have produced the
greatest effect upon Pilate in leading him to the decision to deliver
Jesus to them to be crucified? John 19:12-15.
                         On the Way to Calvary
    9. Having mocked Jesus, what did they do to Him? As they led
Him away to be crucified, what heavy burden was laid upon Him?
To what place was He taken? Mark 15:20; John 19:16, 17.
    NOTE.—"As Jesus passed the gate of Pilate's court, the cross which had
been prepared for Barabbas was laid upon His bruised and bleeding shoulders.
. . . The Saviour's burden was too heavy for Him in His weak and suffering
condition. Since the Passover supper with His disciples, He bad taken neither
food nor drink. He had agonized in the Garden of Gethsemane in conflict
with satanic agencies. He had endured the anguish of the betrayal, and had
seen His disciples forsake Him and flee. He had been taken to Annas, then to
Caiaphas, and then to Pilate. From Pilate He had been sent to Herod, then
sent again to Pilate. From insult to renewed insult, from mockery to mockery,
twice tortured by the scourge,—all that night there had been scene after
scene of a character to try the soul of man to the uttermost. Christ had not
failed. He had spoken no word but that tended to glorify God. All through
the disgraceful farce of a trial He had borne Himself with firmness and
dignity. But when after the second scourging the cross was laid upon Him,
human nature could bear no more. He fell fainting beneath the burden."
 —The Desire of Ages, pages 741, 742.
    10. When Jesus could no longer, carry the cross, upon whom was
it laid? Matt. 27:32.
    NorE.—"Simon had heard of Jesus. His sons were believers in the Saviour,
but he himself was not a disciple: The bearing of the cross to Calvary was a
blessing to Simon, and he was ever after grateful for this providence. It
led him to take upon himself the cross of Christ from choice, and ever
cheerfully stand beneath its burden."—The Desire of Ages, page 742.
  11. What two others were led along with Jesus to crucifixion?
Luke 23:32.
   12. What is said of some who were in the crowd that followed
Jesus to Calvary? For whom did He say they were to weep? To
what scene similar to that pictured by the revelator did Jesus refer?
Luke 23:27-31; Rev. 6:14-17.
   NorE.—"From the fall of Jerusalem the thoughts of Jesus passed to a
wider judgment. In the destruction of the impenitent city He saw a symbol
of the final destruction to come upon the world. . . . By the green tree,
Jesus represented Himself, the innocent Redeemer. God suffered His wrath
against transgression to fall on His beloved Son. Jesus was to be crucified for
the sins of men. What suffering, then, would the sinner bear who continued
in sin? All the impenitent and unbelieving would know a sorrow and misery
that language would fail to express."—The Desire of Ages, page 743.

                      The Crucifixion
  13. Arriving at Calvary, what was offered to Jesus? Matt.
27:33, 34.
   NorE.—"To those who suffered death by the cross, it was permitted to
give a stupefying potion, to deaden the sense of pain. This was offered to
Jesus; but when He had tasted it, He refused it. He would receive, nothing
that could becloud His mind. His faith must keep fast hold upon God. This
was His only strength. To becloud His senses would give Satan an ad-
vantage."—The Desire of Ages, page 746.

  14. How were the three crosses arranged? Luke 23:33; John
19:18.
  15. While Jesus was being nailed to the cross, what words came
from His lips? Upon beholding His agony, what did the people,
rulers, and soldiers say? Luke 23:34-37.
   NorE.—"As soon as Jesus was nailed to the cross, it was lifted by strong
men, and with great violence thrust into the place prepared for it. This
caused the most intense agony to the Son of God."—The Desire of Ages,
page 745.
   "The Saviour made no murmur of complaint. His face remained calm and
serene, but great drops of sweat stood upon His brow. There was no pitying
hand to wipe the death dew from His face, nor words of sympathy and
unchanging fidelity to stay His human heart. While the soldiers were doing
their fearful work, Jesus prayed for His enemies, 'Father, forgive them; for,
they know not what they do.' His mind passed from His own suffering to
the sin of His persecutors, and the terrible retribution that would be theirs."
—The Desire of Ages, page 744.
  16. As Jesus hung on the cross, what scripture was fulfilled?
John 19:23, 24; Ps. 22:18.
  17. What did those do and say who passed by? What did the
priests and scribes do and say? Who else joined in the mockery?
Matt. 27: 39-44.

                            On the Cross
  1. While Jesus was suffering on the cross, what did one of
the crucified thieves say to Him? By whom and in what words was
he rebuked? Luke 23:39-41.
                                     [24]
   NOTE.—"To Jesus in His agony on the cross there came one gleam of
comfort. It was the prayer of the penitent thief. Both the men who were
crucified with Jesus had at first railed upon Him; and one under his suffering
only became more desperate and defiant. But not so with his companion.
This man was not a haidened criminal; he had been led astray by evil asso-
ciations. . . . The dying thieves have no longer anything to fear from man.
But upon one of them presses the conviction that there is a God to fear, a
future to cause him to tremble. And now, all sin-polluted as it is, his fe
history is about to close."—The Desire of Ages, pages 749, 750.
   2. What dying appeal did the penitent thief then make to his
Saviour? Luke 23:42.
   NOTE.—"The Holy Spirit illuminates his mind, and little by little the chain
of evidence is joined together. In Jesus, bruised, mocked, and hanging upon
the cross, he sees the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world.
Hope is mingled with anguish in his voice as the helpless, dying soul casts
himself upon a dying Saviour."—The Desire of Ages, page 750.
   3. What response came from the dying Saviour to this appeal?
Luke 23:43.
   NOTE.—"He Himself did not go that day to Paradise. He slept in the
tomb, and on the morning of the resurrection He said, 'I am not yet ascended
to My Father.' But on the day of the crucifixion, the day of apparent defeat
and darkness, the promise was given. 'Today' while dying upon the cross as
a malefactor, Christ assures the poor sinner, Thou shalt be with Me in Para-
dise."—The Desire of Ages, page 751.
          The Son of God Provides for His. Mother
  4. What women are mentioned as standing by the cross? John
19:25.

   5. When Jesus saw His mother, how did He provide for her
future care? Into whose care did He commit her? John 19:26, 27.
   NOTE.—"As the eyes of Jesus wandered over the multitude about Him,
one figure arrested His attention. At the foot of the cross stood His mother,
supported by the disciple John. She could not endure to remain away from
her Son; and John, knowing that the end was near, had brought her again
to the cross. In His dying hour, Christ remembered His mother. . . . 0
pitiful, loving Saviour; amid all His physical pain and mental anguish; He
had a thoughtful care for His mother! He had no money with" which to
provide for her comfort; but He was enshrined in the heart of John, and He
gave His mother to him as a precious legacy. Thus Hej provided for her that
which she most needed,—the tender sympathy of one who loved her because
she loved Jesus. And in receiving her as a sacred trust, John was receiving
a great blessing. She was a. constant reminder of his beloved Master."-The
Desire of Ages, pages 751, 752.

         Inanimate Nature Witnesies to His Divinity
  6. What supernatural occurrence witnessed to the placing of the
world's sin on the Lamb of God, thus -,sepaating the Father's face
from His Son? Matt. 27:45; 1 Peter 2:24;-first part.
                              [25]
   NorE.—"Upon Christ as our substitute and surety was laid the iniquity
of us all. He was counted a transgressor, that He might redeem us from the
condemnation of the law. The guilt of every descendant of Adam was press-
ing upon His heart. The wrath of God against sin, the terrible manifestation
of His displeasure because of iniquity, filled the soul of His Son with
consternation. . . .
   "With amazement angels witnessed the Saviour's despairing agony. The
hosts of heaven veiled their faces from the fearful sight. Inanimate nature
expressed sympathy with its insulted and dying Author. The sun refused to
look upon the awful scene. Its full, bright rays were illuminating the earth
at midday, when suddenly it seemed to be blotted out. Complete darkness,
like a funeral pall, enveloped the cross. 'There was darkness over all the land
unto the ninth hour' There was no eclipse or other natural cause for this
darkness, which was as deep as midnight without moon or stars. It was a
miraculous testimony given by God that the faith of after generations might
be confirmed."—The Desire of Ages, pages 752, 753.

  7. About the ninth hour what pathetic cry did Jesus, with a loud
voice, utter? Matt. 27:46.
   NOTE.-"At the ninth hour the darkness lifted from the people, but still
enveloped the Saviour. It was a symbol of the agony and horror that weighed
upon His heart."
  "Satan with his fierce temptations wrung the heart of Jesus. The Saviour
could not see through the portals of the tomb. Hope did not present to Him
His coming forth from the grave a conqueror, or tell Him of the Father's
acceptance of the sacrifice. He feared that sin was so offensive to God that
Their separation was to be eternal. Christ felt the anguish which the sinner
will feel when mercy shall no longer plead for the guilty race. It was the
sense of sin, bringing the Father's wrath upon Him as man's substitute, that
made the cup He drank so bitter, and broke the heart of the Son of God."—
The Desire of Ages, pages 754, 753.

  8. After this, that the scripture might be fulfilled, what did Jesus
say? John 19:28.

   9. What did some say who heard His cry? What did one do who
was touched with pity? What did others, mocking at His agony,
say? Matt. 27:47-49.

                           The Death of Jesus
   10. As Jesus paid the price for our salvation, what words of
trust did He utter? Luke 23:46.
   Noia.—"He [Christ] was acquainted with the character of His Father;
He understood His justice, His mercy, and His great love. By faith He
rested in Him whom it had ever been His joy to obey. And as in submis-
sion He committed Himself to God, the sense of the loss of His Father's favor
was withdrawn. By faith, Christ was victor."—The Desire of Ages, page 756.
                                     [26]
   11. As Jesus uttered the words, "It is finished," what occurred
in the temple in Jerusalem at the evening sacrifice? Matt. 27:51,
first part.
   Nora.—"Type has met antitype in the death of God's Son. The great
sacrifice has been made. The way into the holiest is laid open. A new and
living way is prepared for all. No longer need sinful, sorrowing humanity
await the coming of the high priest. Henceforth the Saviour was to officiate
as priest and advocate in the heaven of heavens. It was as if a living voice
had spoken to the worshipers: There is now an end to all sacrifices and
offerings for sin."—The Desire of Ages, pages 756, 757.

  12. What phenomenon occurred in nature as Jesus died? What
other wonderful events affecting many of the saints who were
sleeping occurred? Matt. 27:51 (last part), 52 (first part).

   13. When the Roman centurion and his associates saw these
things, how were they affected? What did they say? Matt. 27:54.
   NoTE.—"These words were said in no whispered tones. All eyes were
turned to see whence they came. Who had spoken? It was the centurion, the
Roman soldier. The divine patience of the Saviour, and His sudden death,
with the cry of victory upon His lips, had impressed this heathen. In the
bruised, broken body hanging upon the cross, the centurion recognized the
form of the Son of God. He could not refrain from confessing his faith."
—The Desire of Ages, page 770.

  14. What company standing afar off witnessed this heart-rending
scene? What was their relation to the work of Jesus? Whose
names are mentioned? Matt. 27:55, 56; Mark 15:40, 41.

                      The Pierced Side
  15. What was one reason for great anxiety on the part of the
Jews? What did they earnestly entreat Pilate to do? John 19:31.

  16. What did the soldiers then do? When they came to Jesus,
what did they discover? What      they refrain from doing? John
19:32, 33.
    Nora.—"Pilate was as unwilling as they for the body of Jesus to remain
 upon the cross. His consent having been obtained, the legs of the two thieves
 were broken to hasten their death; but Jesus was found to be already dead.
 The rude soldiers had been softened by what they had heard and seen of
 Christ, and they were restrained from breaking His limbs. Thus in the
 offering of the Lamb of God was fulfilled the law of the Passover, 'They
 shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone of it: according
 to all the ordinances of the Passover they shall keep it.'"—The Desire of
 Ages, page 771.

    17. What did one of the soldiers do to Jesus? Why were these
 things done? John 19:34-37; Num. 9:12; Zech. 12:10.

position? Matt. 27:57; Luke 23:50, 51.
  2. What request did Joseph make of Pilate? What was Pilate's
response? John 19:38.
   NOTE.—"Even in death, Christ's body was very precious to His disciples.
They longed to give Him an honored burial, but knew not how to accom-
plish this. Treason against the Roman government was the crime for which
Jesus was condemned, and persons put to death for this offense were con-
signed to a burial ground especially provided for such criminals. The disciple
John with the women from Galilee had remained at the cross. They could
not leave the body of their Lord to be handled by the unfeeling soldiers, and
buried in a dishonored grave. Yet they could not prevent it. They could
obtain no favors from the Jewish authorities, and they had no influence with
Pilate.
   "In this emergency, Joseph of Arimathaea and Nicodemus came to the
help of the disciples. Both these men were members of the Sanhedrin, and
were acquainted with Pilate. Both were men of wealth and influence. They
were determined that the body of Jesus should have an honorable burial."
—The Desire of Ages, pages 772, 773.
  3. How did the request of Joseph affect Pilate? How was he
assured that Jesus was already dead? Mark 15:44, 45.

19:39.
   5. How did they prepare the body of Jesus for burial? Where was
it laid, and how was the sepulcher made? Who was sitting by the
sepulcher? John 19:40-42; Matt. 27:59-61.
6. What was the day called upon which Jesus was crucified?•
What day was drawing near? Luke 23:54; Mark 15:42.
                  The Sealed and Guarded Tomb
   7. What did the intense hatred of the chief priests and Pharisees
lead them to do on the Sabbath day? To what saying of Jesus did
they call Pilate's attention? Matt. 27:62, 63; 20:18, 19.
  NOTE.—"They could rest little upon the Sabbath. Though they would-not
step over a Gentile's threshold for fear of defilement, yet they held a council
                                     [28]
concerning the body of Christ. Death and the grave must hold Him whom,
they had crucified."—The Desire of Ages, page 778.
    8. What urgent request did they make of Pilate? What reason
did they give for making this extraordinary request? What did
Pilate say in response? What did they do in their futile efforts to
hold Christ in the tomb? Matt. 27:64-66.
    NOTE.—"The priests gave directions for securing the sepulcher. A great
stone had been placed before the opening. Across this stone they placed cords,
securing the ends to the solid rock, and sealing them with the Roman seal.
. . . The priests did all they could to keep Christ's body where it had been
laid. He was sealed as securely in His tomb as if He were to remain there
through all time."—The Desire of Ages, page 778.
    9. After witnessing the burial of Jesus, what did the women
who came with Him from Galilee do? Luke 23:55, 56.
  10. What had they purposed to do to the body of Jesus? When
did they attempt to carry their purpose into effect? Mark 16:1, 2;
Luke 24:1.
                   A Mighty Angel Visits the Tomb
   11. How had inanimate nature again witnessed to the divinity
of Christ before the women reached the tomb? What was the
appearance of the heavenly visitor? Matt. 28:2, 3.
   Nom.—"The sleeping soldiers start to their feet in a body. They gaze
with awe and wonder at the open heavens, and the vision of brightness which
is nearing them. The earth trembles and heaves as that powerful being from
another world approaches. He is coming on a joyful errand, and the speed
and power of his flight shake the world like a mighty earthquake. Soldiers,
officers, and sentinels, fall as dead men to the earth. . . .
   "Then, with a voice that caused the earth to tremble, he called forth:
   "'Jesus, Thou Son of God, Thy Father calls Thee!'
   "Then He who had earned the power over death came forth from the tomb
with the tread of a conqueror. As He arose from the dead, the earth reeled,
the lightning flashed, and the thunder rolled.
   "An earthquake marked the hour when Christ laid down His life. Another
earthquake witnessed the moment when He took it up again in triumph."—
Christ Our Saviour, pages 140, 141.
   12. How had the presence of the angel affected the guards about
the tomb? Matt. 28:4.
   NOTE.—"This messenger is he who fills the position from which Satan
fell. It is he who on the hills of Bethlehem proclaimed Christ's birth. The
earth trembles at his approach, the hosts of darkness flee, and as he rolls
away the stone, heaven seems to come down to the earth. The soldiers see
him removing the stone as he would a pebble, and hear him cry, Son of God,
come forth; Thy Father calls Thee. They see Jesus come forth from the
grave, and hear Him proclaim over the rent sepulcher, 'I am the resurrection,
and the life.' As He comes forth in majesty and glory, the angel host bow
low in adoration before the Redeemer, and welcome Him with songs of
praise."—The Desire of Ages, page 780.

               A Lying Report Framed by the Priests
   13. Following the resurrection of Jesus, what did some of the
guards who had watched the tomb do? Matt. 28:11.
   NoTE.—"At sight of the angels and the glorified Saviour the Roman guard
had fainted and become as dead men. When the heavenly train was hidden
from their view, they arose to their feet, and as quickly as their trembling
limbs could carry them, made their way to the gate of the garden. Stagger-
ing like drunken men, they hurried on to the city, telling those whom they
met the wonderful news. They were making their way to Pilate, but their
report had been carried to the Jewish authorities, and the chief priests and
rulers sent for them to be brought first into their presence. A strange appear-
ance those soldiers presented. Trembling with fear, their faces colorless, they
bore testimony to the resurrection of Christ. The soldiers told all, just 'as
they had seen it; they had not had time to think or speak anything but the
truth. With painful utterance they said, It was the Son of God who was
crucified; we have heard an angel proclaiming Him as the Majesty of
heaven, the King of glory."—The Desire of Ages, page 781.

  14. When the priests heard the report of the guards and had
taken counsel, how did they seek to stifle the truth? Matt. 28:12, 13.

   15. What assurance of safety did the priests give the soldiers?
What agreement was reached? What henceforth was commonly
reported among the Jews? Matt. 28:14, 15.
   NOTE.—"In order to silence the testimony they feared, the priests'promised
to secure the safety of the guard, saying that Pilate would not desire to have
such a report circulated any more than they did. The Roman soldiers sold
their integrity to the Jews for money. They came in before the priests
burdened with a most startling message of truth ; they went out with a
burden of money, and on their tongues a lying report which had been framed
for them by the priests."—The Desire of Ages, page 782.
  16. Centuries before crucifixion week, what had the Lord said
about the events of this crucial period? Ps. 2:1-4.
  See The Desire of Ages, page 778.

               First Visitors to the Empty Tomb
  1. At His resurrection whom did Christ bring forth from their
graves? Having becn raised, what did they do? Matt. 27:52 (last
part), 53.
                            • [ 301
   NoTE.—"As Christ arose, He brought from the grave a multitude of
captives. The earthquake at His death had rent open their graves, and when
He arose, they came forth with Him. They were those who had been co-
laborers with God, and who at the cost of their lives had borne testimony
to the truth. Now they were to be witnesses for Him who had raised them
from the dead.
   "During His ministry, Jesus had raised the dead to life. He had raised
the son of the widow of Nain, and the ruler's daughter and Lazarus. But
these were not clothed with immortality. After they were raised, they were
still subject to death. But those who came forth from the grave at Christ's
resurrection were raised to everlasting life. They ascended with Him as
trophies of His victory over death and the grave. These, said Christ, are no
longer the captives of Satan; I have redeemed them. I have brought them
from the grave as the first fruits of My power, to be with Me where I am,
nevermore to see death or experience sorrow."—The Desire of Ages, page 786.

   2. Which of Christ's followers was the first to visit the tomb?
What did she see and do? What message did she carry? John
20:1, 2.
   NOTE.—"The women had not all come to the tomb from the same direc-
tion. Mary Magdalene was the first to reach the place; and upon seeing that
the stone was removed, she hurried away to tell the disciples. Meanwhile the
other women came up."—The Desire of Ages, page 788.

   3. What did the other women do? Luke 24:1-3.
   NOTE.—"A light was shining about the tomb, but the body of Jesus was
not there. As they lingered about the place, suddenly they saw that they
were not alone. A young man clothed in shining garments was sitting by the
tomb. It was the angel who had rolled away the stone. He had taken the
guise of humanity that he might not alarm these friends of Jesus. Yet about
him the light of the heavenly glory was still shining, and the women were
afraid. They turned to flee, but the angel's words stayed their steps."—The
Desire of Ages, pages 788, 789.
   4. How did the angel quiet their fears? Matt. 28:5, 6.

   5. What were they bidden to do? How did they respond?
Among the disciples, whose name was specially mentioned? Matt.
28:7, 8;' Mark 16: 7, 8.
   NOTE.—" 'Tell His disciples and Peter,'' the angels said. Since the death of
Christ, Peter had been bowed down with remorse. His shameful denial of the
Lord, and the Saviour's look of love and anguish, were ever before him. Of
all the disciples he, had suffered most bitterly. To him the assurance is given
that his repentance is accepted and his sin forgiven. He is mentioned by
name."—The Desire of Ages, page 793.
                Peter and John at the Empty Tomb
  6. When Mary told Peter and John of Christ's resurrection, what
did they do? Who arrived first? What did he do? John 20:3-5.

                                     [31]
   Norz.—"The disciples hurried to the tomb, and found it as Mary had
said. They saw the shroud and the napkin, but they did not find their Lord.
Yet even here was testimony that He had risen. The graveclothes were not
thrown heedlessly aside, but carefully folded, each in a place by itself. John
`saw, and believed.' He did not yet understand the scripture that Christ must
rise from the dead; but he now remembered the Saviour's words foretelling
His resurrection."—The Desire of Ages, page 789.

8. Following Peter into the sepulcher, how was John affected by
what he saw? As yet, what had they failed to understand? To
what place did they then go? John 20:8-10.

              The First Appearing of the Risen Lord
   9. After the disciples had departed, what did Mary do? Looking
into the tomb, what did she see? John 20:11, 12.
   NorE.—"Mary had followed John and Peter to the tomb; when they
returned to Jerusalem, she remained. As she looked into the empty tomb,
grief filled her heart."—The Desire of Ages, pages 789, 790.

  10. What did the angels say to Mary? What was her response?
Turning to depart, whom did she see? What did she not know?
John 20:13, 14.

   11. What did Jesus say to Mary? How did she reply? Whom
did she believe Him to be? What did Jesus then say to her?
Recognizing His familiar voice, how did she address Him? John
20:15, 16.
   NOTE.—"If this rich man's tomb was thought too honorable a burial
place for Jesus, she herself would provide a place for Him. There was a
grave that Christ's own voice had made vacant, the grave where Lazarus
had lain. Might she not there find a burial place for her Lord? She felt that
to care for His precious crucified body would,be a great consolation to her
in'her grief.
   "But now in His own familiar voice Jesus said to her, 'Mary.' Now she
knew that it was not a stranger who was addressing her, and turning she
saw before her the living Christ. In her joy she forgot that He had been
crucified. Springing toward Him, as if to embrace His feet, she said, 'Rah-
boni.' "—The Desire of Ages, page 790.

   12. What more did Jesus say to Mary? What joyful message did
she then take to the disciples? John 20:,17, 18.
   NOTE.—"Jesus refused to receive the homage of His people until He had
the assurance that His sacrifice was accepted by the Father. He ascended to
the heavenly courts, and from God Himself heard the assurance that His
atonement for the sins of men had been ample, that through His blood all
might gain eternal life. The Father ratified the covenant made with Christ,
that He would receive repentant and obedient men, and would love them
even as He loves His Son. Christ was to complete lis work, and fulfill His
pledge to 'make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than the
                                    [32]
golden wedge of Ophir.' All power in heaven and on earth was given to the
Prince of life, and He returned to His followers in a world of sin, that He
might impart to them of His power and glory."—The Desire of Ages, page
790.
                       Slow of Heart to Believe
  13. Having returned from His Father's presence, and meeting
the other women, how did Jesus greet them? What did they do?
What did He say to them? Matt. 28:9, 10.

   14. When Mary Magdalene and the other women told the
disciples what they had seen and heard, how was their message
received? Luke 24:10, 11; Mark 16:9-11.
   NoTE.—"Christ's first work on earth after His resurrection was to con-
vince His disciples of His undiminished love and tender regard for them. To
give them proof that He was their living Saviour, that He had broken the
fetters of the tomb, and could no longer be held by the enemy death ; to
reveal that He had the same heart of love as when He was with them as
their beloved Teacher, He appeared to them again and again. He would
draw the bonds of love still closer around them. Go tell My brethren, He
said, that they meet Me in Galilee."—The Desire of Ages, page 793.

24:13, 14.
    NOTE.—"Late in the.afternoon of the day of the resurrection, two of the
 disciples were on their way to Emmaus, a little town eight miles from
 Jerusalem. These disciples had had no prominent place in Christ's work,
 but they were earnest believers in Him. . . . They were now returning to
 their homes to meditate and pray. Sadly they pursued their evening walk,
 talking over the scenes of the trial and the crucifixion. Never before had
 they been so utterly disheartened. Hopeless and faithless, they were walking
 in the shadow of the cross."—The Desire of Ages, page 795.

   2. Who joined them as they walked along the way engaged in
 earnest conversation? Why did . they not recognize Him? Luke
24:15, 16.
                                      [ 33 1   •
. NOTE.—"They were reasoning in regard to the lessons that Christ had
 given, which they seemed unable to comprehend. As they talked of the
 events that had taken place, Jesus longed to comfort them. He had seen
 their grief ; He understood the conflicting, perplexing ideas that brought to
 their minds the thought, Can this Man, who suffered Himself to be so
 humiliated, be the Christ? Their grief could not be restrained, and they
 wept. Jesus knew that their hearts were bound up with Him in love, and
 He longed to wipe away their tears, and fill them with joy and gladness. But
 He must first give them lessons they would never forget."—The Desire of
 Ages, page 795.

  3. What question did Jesus ask? What reply did Cleopas make?

                       The Witness of Prophecy
   5. How did the Stranger reply to their words? Luke 24:25, 26.
   NoTE.—"The disciples wondered who this stranger could be, that He
should penetrate to their very souls, and speak with such earnestness, tender-
ness, and sympathy, and with such hopefulness. For the first time since
Christ's betrayal, they began to feel hopeful. Often they looked earnestly
at their companion, and thought that His words were just the words that
Christ would have spoken. They were filled with amazement, and their hearts
began to throb with joyful expectation."—The Desire of Ages, page 796.
   "0 foolish men, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have
spoken!" Verse 25, R. V.
   6. What did Jesus then do to make clear to the understanding
of these believers His mission to this world, as revealed in the
prophetic word? Luke 24:27.
   NoTE.—"It was necessary for them to understand the witness borne to
Him by the types and prophecies of the Old Testament. Upon these their
faith must be established. Christ performed no miracle to convince them,
but it was His first work to' explain the Scriptures. They had looked upon
His death as the destruction of all their hopes. Now He showed from the
prophets that this was the very strongest evidence for their faith."—The
Desire of Ages, pages 796, 799.
                       A Wonderful Experience
   7. As they came near to Emmaus, what did Jesus do? What did
the two disciples urge Him to do, and for what reason? Luke
24:28, 29.
   NoTE.—"Had the disciples failed to press their invitation, they would not
have known that their traveling companion was the risen Lord. Christ never
forces His company upon anyone. He interests Himself in those who need
Him. Gladly will He enter the humblest home, and cheer the lowliest heart.
But if men are too indifferent to think of the heavenly guest, or ask Him to
abide with them, He passes on."—The Desire of Ages, page 800.
                                    [84]

   9. What did the two disciples immediately do? Whom did they
find together? What was the group saying? What wondrous
story did the two disciples relate? Luke 24:33-35.
   NOTE.—"With this great news to communicate they cannot sit and talk.
Their weariness and hunger are gone. They leave their meal untasted, and
full of joy immediately set out again on the same path by which they came,
hurrying to tell the tidings to the disciples in the city."—The Desire of Ages,
pages 800, 801.
         First Appearance to the Assembled Disciples
  10. While the disciples were discussing the joyful news, who
appeared to them? With what words did He salute them? How
were they affected by what to them seemed a strange appearance?
Luke 24:36, 37.
  NOTE.—"Behold, another Person stands before them. Every eye is
fastened upon the Stranger. No one has knocked for entrance. No footstep
has been heard. The disciples are startled, and wonder what it means. Then
they hear a voice which is no other than the voice of their Master. Clear and
distinct the words fall from His lips, 'Peace be unto you.' "—The Desire of
Ages, pages 802, 803.

Christ? Luke 24:44.
  13. What did Jesus say to them again? What charge did He
give them? Having thus spoken, what did He do and say? John
20:21-23; Luke 24:45.
  NOTE.—"Before the disciples could fulfill their official duties in connection
with the church, Christ breathed His Spirit upon them. He was committing
to them a most sacred trust, and He desired to impress them with the fact
that without the Holy Spirit this work could not be accomplished."—The
Desire of Ages, page 805.

  14. How did Jesus show the relation between the prophecies and
His suffering, death, and resurrection? What, therefore, is the duty
of His people? What are they? Luke 24:46-48.
  NOTE.—"During these days that Christ spent with His disciples, they
 gained a new experience. As they heard their beloved Master explaining the,
 Scriptures in the light of all that had happened, their faith in Him was fully
 established. They reached the place where they could say, 'I know whom I
 have believed.' "—The Acts of the Apostles, page 27.
                                        I35]
          The Second Appearing; the Doubting Thomas
    15. When Jesus first met with His disciples, who was absent?
When Thomas was told by the other disciples that they had seen
the Lord, what emphatic statement did he make? John 20:24, 25.

20:27-29.
    NoTE.—"Many who are given to doubt excuse themselves by saying that
if they had the evidence which Thomas had from his companions, they
would believe. They do not realize that they have not only that evidence,
but much more. Many who, like Thomas, wait for all cause of doubt to be
removed, will never realize their desire. They gradually become confirmed in
unbelief."—The Desire of Ages, page 807.
    18. What was the purpose of all the signs Jesus gave? John
20:30, 31.

What was the marvelous result of ready obedience to the Master's
command? John 21: 8-11.
   Nom.—"They were too much amazed to question whence came the fire
and the food. "Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now
caught.' Peter rushed for the net, which he had dropped, and helped his
brethren drag it to the shore. After the work was done, and the preparation
made, Jesus bade the disciples come and dine. He broke the food, and
divided it among them, and was known and acknowledged by all the seven.
The miracle of feeding the five thousand on the mountainside was now
brought to their minds; but a mysterious awe was upon them, and in silence
they gazed upon the risen Saviour."—The Desire of Ages, page 810.
   6. What invitation did Jesus extend to the disciples? What
caused them apparent embarrassment? What did Jesus then do?
SinCe His resurrection, how many times had Jesus appeared to His
disciples? John 21:12-14.

How did the three questions, confessions, and charges vary? John
21:15-17.
   NOTE.—"Three times Peter had openly denied his Lord, and three times

9. How was Peter's question answered? How was this statement
misunderstbod by the brethren? John 21:22, 23.
 Nora.—"How many today are like Peter! They are interested in the
affairs of others, and anxious to know their duty, while they are in danger of
neglecting their own. It is our work to look to Christ and follow Him. We
shall see mistakes in the lives of others, and defects in their character.
Humanity is encompassed with infirmity. But in Christ we shall find perfec-
tion. Beholding Him, we shall become transformed."—The Desire of Ages,
page 816.
                  A Large Assembly of Believers

                                    [37]
   Nora.—"At the time appointed, about five hundred believers were collected
in little knots on the mountainside, eager to learn all that could be learned
from those who had seen Christ since His resurrection. From group to
group the disciples passed, telling all they had seen and heard of Jesus, and
reasoning from the Scriptures as He had done with them. Thomas recounted
the story of his unbelief, and told how his doubts had been swept away.
Suddenly Jesus stood among them. No one could tell whence or how He
came. Many who were present had never before seen Him; but in His hands
and feet they beheld the marks of the crucifixion; His countenance was as
the face of God, and when they saw Him, they worshiped Him."—The Desire
of Ages, page 819.

        Boundless Authority and the Divine Commission
   12. What did Jesus say had been given to Him? What commis-
sion was given to the disciples and to the believers? What were
they to teach? How long will He abide with His people? Matt.
28:18-20.
   Nora.—"Standing but a step from His heavenly throne, Christ gave the
commission to His disciples. . . . The commission had been given to the
twelve when Christ met with them in the upper chamber; but it was now to
be given to a larger number. At the meeting on a mountain in Galilee, all the
believers who could be called together were assembled. . . . His words
carried the minds of His hearers above earthly and temporal things to the
heavenly and eternal. They were lifted to the highest conception of His
dignity and glory."—The Desire of Ages, pages 818, 819.

   13. While sitting at meat with the eleven apostles, in what words
did He commission them? What signs of their heavenly mission
are to follow those who believe? What purpose are these signs to
serve? Mark 16:14-18, 20.
   NOTE.—"The Saviour's commission to the disciples included all the be-
lievers. It includes all believers in Christ to the end of time. . . . All to
whom the heavenly inspiration has come are put in trust with the gospel. All
who receive the life of Christ are ordained to work for the salvation of their
fellow men. For this work the church was established, and all who take upon
themselves its sacred vows are thereby pledged to be coworkers with Christ."
—The Desire of Ages, page 822.

                      Power for Service
  14. Following His resurrection, how long did Jesus remain with
His chosen apostles before His ascension? What was He doing?
What did He command them not to do, also to do? Acts 1:1-4;
Luke 24:49.

   15. What wonderful promise did Jesus then give? Acts 1:5, 8.
  NoTE.—"The promise is as far-reaching as the commission. Not that all
the gifts are imparted to each believer. The Spirit divides 'to every man
severally as He will.' But the gifts of the Spirit are promised to every•
believer according to his need for the Lord's work. . . .
  "The gospel still possesses the same power, and why should we not today
                                     as
witness the same results? . . . Christ's servants are His representatives, the
channels for His working. He desires through them to exercise His healing
power."—The Desire of Ages, pages 823, 824.
                        The Ascension of Jesus
   16. Having finished His instruction to His beloved disciples,
what occurred? Acts 1:9; Luke 24:51; Mark 16:19.
   NOTE.—"With hands outstretched in blessing, and as if in assurance of His
protecting care, He slowly ascended from among them, drawn heavenward by
a power stronger than any earthly attraction. As He passed upward, the
awestricken disciples looked with straining eyes for the. last glimpse of their
ascending Lord. A cloud of glory hid Him from their sight ; and the words
came back to them as the cloudy chariot of angels received Him, `Lo, I am
with you alway, even unto the end of the world. At the same time there
floated down to them the sweetest and most joyous music from the angel
choir."—The Desire of Ages, pages 830, 831.
  17. While the disciples watched intently for the last glimpse of
their ascending Redeemer, whom did they see standing by them?
What joyful message did they bring? Acts 1:10, 11.
   18. As Jesus approached the gates barring •entrance to the
celestial courts, what did the escorting angels say? What was the
response from within? Ps. 24:7-10.

   "The family of heaven and the family of earth are one. For us our Lord
ascended, and for us He lives. 'Wherefore He is able also to save them to
the uttermost that come unto God by Him, seeing He ever liveth to make
intercession for them.' "—The Desire of Ages, page 835.

           THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
                                     China Division—September 27


C   HINA today presents a gigantic mission problem. It is a country
     of great cities and multiplied millions of people who need the
saving gospel message. The overflow of the Thirteenth Sabbath
Offering this quarter is devoted to the building of chapels and churches
in the China Division. A church building is greatly needed in Shang-
hai; for the believers have been meeting for years in the Y.M.C.A.
building, and now they must vacate. Equally urgent is the need in
many other large centers of China. How much it would help to be
able to invite prospective converts to representative church buildings
in these places!
    The overflow for the first quarter of 1946 was devoted to the
medical missionary work in Free China. This amounted to $33,091.50.
Now China needs a much larger offering to erect chapels and churches
in which our people may worship. Are you willing to give $5 or more
for this work?
