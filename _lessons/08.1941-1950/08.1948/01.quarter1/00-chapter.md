                Bible Doctrines for Our Day

                    Lesson 1, for January 3, 1948
              Searching for Hidden Treasure
    MEMORY VERSE: "Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in
a field; the which when a man bath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and
selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field." Matt. 13:44.
    STUDY HELP: "Christ's Object Lessons," pages 103-121 (new edition, pages
101-121).
                        The Search for Treasure
    L To what did Jesus compare the kingdom of heaven? What
does it take to obtain it? Matt. 13:44.
    NOTE.—"In the parable the field containing the treasure represents the holy
Scriptures. And the gospel is the treasure. The earth itself is not so interlaced
with golden veins and filled with precious things as is the word of God. The
treasures of the gospel are said to be hidden."—Christ's Object Lessons, page
104.
   2. By what other parable did Jesus illustrate the value of the
heavenly treasure? What must be sacrificed in order to obtain it?
Verses 45, 46.
   NOTE.—"Christ Himself is the pearl of great price."—Christ's Object Les-
sons, page 115.
    3. While lost humanity seeks for the great pearl, what is Christ
doing? Luke 19:10.
    NoTE.—"The parable of the merchantman seeking goodly pearls has a
double significance: it applies not only to men as seeking the kingdom of
heaven, but to Christ as seeking His lost inheritance. Christ, the heavenly
merchantman seeking goodly pearls, saw in lost humanity the pearl of price.
In man, defiled and ruined by sin, He saw the possibilities of redemption.
Hearts that have been the battleground of the conflict with Satan, and that
have been rescued by the power of love, are more precious to the Redeemer
than are those who have never fallen. God looked upon humanity, not as vile
and worthless; He looked upon it in Christ, saw it as it might become through
redeeming love. He collected all the riches of the universe, and laid them down
in order to buy the pearl. And Jesus, having found it, resets it in His own dia-
dem."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 118.
  4. What statement reveals that the New and Old Testament
Scriptures are the foundation of the church? Who occupies the
                            -[ 3] -
chief place in the foundation of this spiritual temple? Eph. 2:19-
22; 1 Cor. 3:11.
                    Christ in All the Scriptures
   5. What parable illustrates the necessity of digging deep to find
a solid Scriptural foundation? Luke 6:47-49.
   NOTE.—"Every building erected on other foundation than God's word,
will fall. He who, like the Jews in Christ's day, builds on the foundation of
human ideas and opinions, of forms and ceremonies of man's invention, or on
any works that he can do independently of the grace of Christ, is erecting his
structure of character upon the shifting sand. The fierce tempests of tempta-
tion will sweep away the sandy foundation, and leave his house a wreck on the
shores of time."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, page 216.

   6. What .rebuke did Jesus give the Jews for failing to find Him
as they searched the Scriptures? Of whom did He say Moses wrote?
John 5:39, 40, 46.

   7. In what language did Paul state that the purpose of the Scrip-
tures is to reveal Christ, in whom alone is salvation? How depend-
able and valuable are the Sacred Writings? 2 Tim. 3:15-27.
8. How many of the Old Testament Scriptures reveal Christ?
What event in His life is especially portrayed? Luke 24:25-27.
   NoTE.—"The sacrifice of Christ as an atonement for sin is the great truth
around which all other truths cluster. In order to be rightly understood and
appreciated, every truth in the word of God, from Genesis to Revelation, must
be studied in the light that streams from the cross of Calvary.—Gospel Workers,
page 315.

           Increasing Knowledge of Scripture Is Vital
   9. What foods are used to represent both the simple and the deep
truths of the word? What statement shows that spiritual age and
growth are necessary to an understanding of the deep things of God?
Heb. 5:12-14.
    10. Who did the prophet Isaiah say would understand Bible doc-
trine? By what method of study would they gain this knowledge?
Isa. 28:9, 10, 13.
    NOTE.—"Every mind should turn with reverent attention to the revealed
word of God. Light and grace will be given to those who thus obey God. They
will behold wondrous things out of His law. Great truths that have lain un-
heeded and unseen since the Day of Pentecost, are to shine from God's word in
their native purity."—Fundamentals of Christian Education, page 473.

  11. Because of the variety of subjects covered by each prophet
what admonition is given? What warning is sounded and for what
                                   —[4]—
reason? What assurance is given regarding the true foundation?
2 Tim. 2:15, 16, 19.
   12. For what reason did Paul commend the Bereans? Acts 17:11.
   NOTE.—"Let every student who values the heavenly treasure put to
the stretch his mental and spiritual powers, and sink the shaft deep into the
mine of truth, that he may obtain the celestial gold,—that wisdom which will
make him wise unto salvation,"—Fundamentals of Christian Education, pages
169, 170.

   13. How inexhaustible is the mine of truth? Rom. 11:33; Col. 2:3.
   NOTE.—"As we contemplate the great things of God's word, we look
into a fountain that broadens and deepens beneath our gaze. Its breadth and
depth pass our knowledge. As we gaze, the vision widens; stretched out before
us we behold a boundless, shoreless sea."—Education, page 171.
                  Increasing Light and Power
   14. How is the pathway of the just described? Prov. 4:18.
   NOTE.—"No church can advance in holiness unless its members are ear-
nestly seeking for truth as for hid treasure."—The Great Controversy, page 522.
   15. What statement did Jesus make regarding the book of Dan-
iel? When will this book especially yield its treasures to the searcher
for truth? Matt. 24:15; Dan. 12:4, 9.
   NOTE.—"As we near the close of this world's history, the prophecies re-
corded by Daniel demand our special attention, as they relate to the very time
in which we are living."—Prophets and Kings, page 547.

  16. What other book of the Bible is recommended for reading
and study? At what time does this admonition especially apply?
Rev. 1:3; 22:7.
  NOTE.—"When we as a people understand what this book means to us, there
will be seen among us a great revival. We do not understand fully the lessons
that it teaches, notwithstanding the injunction given us to search and study it."
—Testimonies to Ministers, page 113.

   17. To whom only will the gates of the celestial city be opened?
Isa. 26:2.

                   Lesson 2, for January 10, 1948.
                  The Memorial of Creation
  MEMORY VERSE: "And hallow My Sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between
Me and you, that ye may know that I am the Lord your God." Eze. 20:20.
  STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pages 281-289.

                        The Living Word
   1. How is Christ identified with the work of creation? John 1:1-
3, 10, 14.
                               -[5 -
  2. Through what method did God create the world? By whom?
How does He preserve His creation? Ps. 33:6, 9; Heb. 1:2, 3.
    3. How is faith described? Since no man witnessed the creation
of the world, upon what evidence does the Christian base his belief
in the Biblical record? Heb. 11:1-3.
   NOTE.—The word translated "substance" in Hebrews 11:1 is shown by the
papyri to be the word used for "title deed."
   4. How is Jehovah identified as the true and living God? How
may we know that all other gods are false? What fate will therefore
befall them? Jer. 10:10-12, 14, 15.
                      The Creator and the Creature
   5. How does the psalmist state the reason for the superiority of
Jehovah over all other gods? What should we therefore do? Ps.
96:4, 5; 95:3-6.
   NOTE.—"The duty to worship God is based upon the fact that He is the
Creator, and that to Him all other beings owe their existence. And wherever,
in the Bible, His claim to reverence and worship, above the gods of the heathen,
is presented, there is cited the evidence of His creative power."—The Great
Controversy, pages 436, 437.
   6. On what basis do the twenty-four elders worship God and
recognize their allegiance to Him? Rev. 4:10, 11.
   7. What reason for obedience and reverence to God is given in
the first angel's message? To prepare for the judgment, who must be
worshiped and why? Rev. 14:6, 7.
   8. From youth onward, what attitude toward the Creator and His
works should all maintain? Eccl. 12:1; Ps. 111:4.
                    Man to Acknowledge His Maker
   9. What religious observance was instituted at the close of the
creation of "the heavens anti the earth"? How was it set apart? Gen.
2:1-3.
   NOTE.—"God designs that the Sabbath shall direct the minds of men to the
contemplation of His created works. Nature speaks to their senses, declaring
that there is a living God, the Creator, the Supreme Ruler of all. . . . The
beauty that clothes the earth is a token of God's love. We may behold it in the
everlasting hills, in the lofty trees, in the opening buds and the delicate flowers.
All speak to us of God. The Sabbath, ever pointing to Him who made them all,
bids men open the great book of nature, and trace therein the wisdom, the
power, and the love of the Creator."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 48.
   "Sanctify" means "to make holy or sacred, to separate, to set apart or ap-
point to a sacred or religious use, to proclaim."—Webster.
   10. For whose benefit was the Sabbath made? What statement ,
                              [ §]-
indicates that Christ, who made everything that was made, also made
or instituted the Sabbath? Mark 2:27, 28.
   NOTE.—" 'The Son of man is Lord even of the Sabbath.' . . . Thus He in-
timated that, as the Son of God, He had at first instituted the Sabbath; that
He gave the law from Mount Sinai; and that He had lost none of His authority
by His humiliation."—Scott's Notes, on Matthew 12:8.

   11. How is the Sabbath set forth in the Decalogue as the memo- ,
rial of creation? Ex. 20:8-11.
   NOTE.—"He that observes the Sabbath aright holds the history of that
which it celebrates to be authentic. He therefore believes in the creation of the
first man; in the creation of a fair abode for man in the space of six days; in
the primeval and absolute creation of the heavens and the earth, and as a nec-
essary antecedent to all this, in the Creator, who at the close of His latest
creative effort, rested on the seventh day. The Sabbath thus becomes a sign
by which the believers in a historical revelation are distinguished from those
who have allowed these great facts to fade from their remembrance."—James
G. Murphy, quoted in The Moody Bible Institute Monthly, November, 1930.

   12. What instruction of the Lord to Moses while he was- still in
the mount further emphasizes the importance of the Sabbath? Ex.
31:13.
              The Duration of the Sabbath Command
   13. How long is the Sabbath to be observed? Of what is it de-
clared to be a sign? Verses 16, 17.
   NOTE.—"The Sabbath. By this is meant, the day appointed of God, at the
close of creation, to be observed by man as a day of rest from all secular em-
  loyment, because that in it God Himself had rested from His work. Gen. 2:1-3.
   ot that God's rest was necessitated by fatigue, Isa. 40:28; but He rested, that
is, ceased to work, on the seventh day as an example to man; hence assigned it
as a reason why men should rest on that day. Ex. 20:11; 31:17. God's blessing
and sanctifying the day, meant that He separated it from a common to a reli-
gious use, to be a perpetual memorial or sign that all who thus observed it
would show themselves to be the worshipers of that God who made the world
in six days and rested on the seventh. Ex. 20:8, 11; 31:16, 17; Isa. 56:6, 7."
—Binney's Theological Compend Improved, pages 169, 170.
                                                     •
  14. How is the Sabbath again declared to be the sign of the true
God? Eze. 20:20.
   15. What Scriptural declaration shows that Sabbath observance
will continue through all eternity? Isa. 66:22, 23.
   NOTE.—The Sabbath is based upon the fact of creation. As long as it re-
mains a fact that God created the..heavens and the earth in six days and rested
on the seventh, just so long must the Sabbath remain as the memorial of that
event and as the "birthday of the world."

                   Lesson 3, for January 17, 1948
                  The Sign of Sanctification
   MEMORY VERSE: "Moreover also I gave them My Sabbaths, to be a sign be-
tween Me and them, that they might know that I am the Lord that sanctify them."
Eze. 20:12.
   STUDY HELP: "Testimonies," vol. 6, pp. 349-353.

                   The Power of the Creator
   1. What other work than creation is ascribed to the Lord? Isa.
43:1; 54:5.
   NOTE.—"Angels prostrated themselves at the feet of their Commander,
and offered to become a sacrifice for man. But an angel's life 'could not pay
the debt ; only He who created man had the power to redeem him."—Patriarchs
and Prophets, pages 64, 65.

   2. In His redemptive work, what assurance does the Creator give
of His power to blot out transgressions? Isa. 44:21-24.
   3. What evidence does the Lord offer that He is the only true
God? What is said of the false gods who cannot create? Isa. 45:18,
20-22.
   4. In whom alone is there redemption and forgiveness? What
proof is given that Christ has the power to redeem? Col. 1:14-16.
   NOTE.—"The broken law of God demanded the life of the sinner. In all the
universe there was but one who could, in behalf of man, satisfy its claims. Since
the divine law is as sacred as God Himself, only one equal with God could make
atonement for its transgression. None but Christ could redeem fallen man from
the curse of the law, and bring him again into harmony with Heaven."—
Patriarchs and Prophets, page 63.

  5. What is the relation of the Sabbath to both creation and re-
demption? Ex. 31:13, 17.
  NOTE.—"The Sabbath is a sign of creative and redeeming power; it points
to God as the ,source of life and knowledge; it recalls man's primeval glory,
and thus witnesses to God's purpose to re-create us in His own image."—Edu-
cation, page 250.
               The Blessing of Sabbath Observance
   6. In what language does another scripture declare the Sabbath
to be the sign or memorial of sanctification or redemption? Eze. 20:
12.
   NOTE.—"All who regard the Sabbath as a sign between them and God,
showing that He is the God who sanctifies them, will represent the principles of
His government. They will bring into daily practice the laws of His kingdom.
Daily it will be their prayer that the sanctification of the Sabbath may rest
upon them. Every day they will have the companionship of Christ, and will
exemplify the perfection of His character."—Testimonies, vol. 6, pp. 353, 354.
                                    -[ 8 ] -
   7. Upon whom is a special blessing pronounced in the last days?
From what will true Sabbathkeepers abstain? Isa. 56:1, 2.
    NOTE.—"To all who receive the Sabbath as a sign of Christ's creative and
redeeming power, it will be a delight. Seeing Christ in it, they delight them-
selves in Him. The Sabbath points them to the works of creation at an evidence
of His mighty power in redemption."—The Desire of Ages, page 289.

   8. What shows that all nations are included in the promised bless-
ing upon Sabbathkeepers? What great ingathering is described?
Verses 4-7.
   9. What New Testament statement shows that redemption from
sin is a new creation? How complete is the change wrought, and in
whom and by whom is it accomplished? 2 Cor. 5:17.

                The Meaning of Sabbathkeeping
   10. How long will the memorial of God's holy name or character
endure? For what therefore            3-:az 7.:1;--2nished to give
thanks? Ps. 135:13; 30:4, margin.
    11. How are the creation and the Sabbath referred to in the epis-
tle to the Hebrews? Heb. 4:3, 4.
   12. What shows that true Sabbathkeeping is a rest or freedom
from sin and therefore a foretaste of heaven? What is said regard-
ing the perpetuity of the Sabbath? Heb. 4:8-11, margin.
    NOTE.—The word "Sabbath" means "rest." Webster defines "rest" as free-
dom from anything that disquiets, worries, or annoys; peace, quiet, security,
tranquillity. Since there is no peace to the wicked, the Sabbath rest indicates
a freedom from sin which produces a heavenly atmosphere.
    "To those who keep holy the Sabbath day it is the sign of sanctification.
True sanctification is harmony with God, oneness with Him in character. It is
received through obedience to those principles that are the transcript of His
character."—Testimonies, vol. 6, pp. 349, 350.

  13. What statement of Jesus shows that soul-rest, and thus true
Sabbath observance, is impossible apart from Him? Matt. 11:28-30.

                        Redemptive Power
   14. What is the gospel declared to be? How is the power of God
to save from sin revealed? Rom. 1:16, 19, 20.
   NoTE.—"But in order to keep the Sabbath holy, men must themselves be
holy. Through faith they must become partakers of the righteousness of
Christ. . . . As the Jews departed from God, and failed to make the righteous-
ness of Christ their own by faith, the'Sabbath lost its significance to them. Sa-
tan was seeking to exalt himself and to draw men away from Christ, and he
worked to pervert'the Sabbath, because it is the sign of the power of Christ."
—The Desire of Ages, page 283.

   15. How completely will the power of God unto salvation be
manifested in the lives of God's remnant people? Eph. 5:25-27.
    NOTE.—"The spotless robe of Christ's righteousness is placed upon the tried,
tempted, yet faithful children of God. The despised 'remnant are clothed in
glorious apparel, nevermore to be defiled by the corruptions of the world.
Their names are retained in the Lamb's book of life, enrolled among the faith-
ful of all ages."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 475.
    16. While angels are holding in restraint the four winds of
heaven, what last-day message is proclaimed? What is said of the
characters of those who live through the final crisis? Rev. 7:1-4, 14.
    NOTE.—The Douay Version uses "sign" and "signed" for "seal" and "sealed,"
and the Swedish says, "sealed with a mark." "Sign," "seal," and "mark" ate
synonymous. The Sabbath is the outward sign or mark of a godly character.
"They are marked characters because of their purity of heart and life, their
strength of purpose, their firmness and usefulness in the cause of God. They
are God's noblemen."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 578.
    17. In a later vision, where did the prophet see the same sealed
saints? What testifies to their godlike characters? What high stand-
ard have they reached? Rev. 14:1, 5.
    NoTE.—"Not one of us will ever receive the seal of God while our charac-
ters have one spot or stain upon them. It is left with us to remedy the defects
in our characters, to cleanse the soul-temple of every defilement. Then the lat-
ter rain will fall upon us as the early rain fell upon the disciples on the Day of
Pentecost."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 214.
   18. In view of these facts, what is the great need of God's remnant
people as regards the Sabbath?
   Answer: A greater vision of the spiritual significance of Sabbath observ-
ance.
   NOTE.—" 'I saw that God had children who do not see and keep the Sab-
bath. They have not rejected the light upon it. And at the commencement of
the time of trouble, we were filled with the Holy Ghost as we went forth and
proclaimed the Sabbath more fully.'"—Early Writings, page 85.



                   Lesson 4, for January 24, 1948
                   True Sabbath Observance

                   Remembrance of God's Day
    1. What are we commanded to remember? What distinguishes
 the time given to man for his use and the time reserved for God?
 Ex. 20:8, 9.
    Norz.—The days set apart for labor are called "the six working days" in
-Ezekiel 46:1.
                                - 10 -
    2. To whom does the Sabbath belong? How many are included
in the Sabbath restrictions? What fundamental reason for the fourth
commandment is given? Ex. 20:10, 11.

   3. What instruction had the Lord previously given regarding
preparation for the Sabbath? What was the day immediately pre-
ceding the Sabbath called? Ex. 16:4, 5, 22, 23; Luke 23:54.
   NOTE.—"While preparation for the Sabbath is to be made all through the
week, Friday is to be the special preparation day. . . .
   "On Friday let the preparation for the Sabbath be completed. See that all
the clothing is in readiness, and that all the cooking is done. . . .
   "There is another work that should receive attention on the preparation
day. On this day all differences between brethren, whether in the family or in
the church, should be put away. . . .
   "Before the Sabbath begins, the mind as well as the body should be with-
drawn from worldly business."—Testimonies, vol. 6, pp. 354-356.

    4. What is the Sabbath called to indicate that it is a day of re-
ligious assembly? Lev. 2 3:3.
    NOTE.—"Convoke" means to call together, to summon to an assembly. The
Sabbath is a day for God's people to assemble for worship—a "holy convoca-
tion."

                 In God's House on God's Day
   5. How did David express his longing for these occasions when
the "multitude" should go to the house of God? Ps. 42:1, 2, 4;
122:1, 4.
   NoTE.—"As you enter the place of worship, ask the Lord to remove all evil
from your heart. Bring to His house only that which He can bless. Kneel
before God in His temple, and consecrate to Him His own, which He has
purchased with the blood of Christ. . . .
   "The place of worship may be very humble, but it is no less acknowledged
by God. To those who worship God in spirit and in truth and in the beauty of
holiness it will be as the gate of heaven."—Testimonies, vol. 6, pp. 362, 363.

   6. How is the importance of congregational worship emphasized
in the New Testament? When does this admonition especially
apply? Heb. 10:25.

    7. As we come into the courts of the Lord what are we to bring?
 Ps. 96:8.
    NOTE.—"God gave direction to the Israelites to assemble before Him at set
periods. . . . And they were commanded not to appear before the Lord empty.
They were to bring tokens of their gratitude to God for His continual mercies
and blessings bestowed upon them. . . . God requires no less of His people
in these last days, in sacrifices and offerings, than He did of the Jewish nation."
—Testimonies, vol. 2, pp. 573, 574.

             The Consequence of Sabbath Desecration
   8. How is the laxness in Sabbathkeeping of ancient Israel de-
scribed? What punishment was meted out to a violator in the
wilderness? Eze. 20:21-24; Num. 15:32-36.
   9. On what condition did the Lord promise that Jerusalem would
stand forever? What threat of disaster shows the danger of care-
lessness in Sabbath observance? Jer. 17:24, 25, 27.
   NOTE.—According to this scripture, Jerusalem was destroyed chiefly be-
cause the sacredness of the Sabbath was forgotten and the holy day was com-
mercialized. Is not this also a warning to modern Israel?
   10. After the return from captivity what needed reformation
was instituted by Nehemiah? To what did he attribute the calamity
that had befallen them? Neh. 13:15-18.
  11. What steps did Nehemiah take to prevent a repetition of the
Sabbath desecrations? What statement indicates the time when the
Sabbath begins? Neh. 13:19-21.
    12. What regulation in connection with the Passover may be
taken also as marking the beginning and close of the weekly Sab-
bath? Lev. 23:32; Deut. 16:6. Compare Mark 1:21, 32.
   NOTE.—"Many carelessly put off till the beginning of the Sabbath little
things that might have been done on the day of preparation. This should not
be. Work that is neglected until the beginning of the Sabbath should remain
undone until it is past. This course might help the memory of these thoughtless
ones, and make them careful to do their own work on the six working days."—
Patriarchs and Prophets, page 296.
   "When the Sabbath commences we should place a guard upon ourselves,
upon our acts and our words, lest we rob God by appropriating to our own
use that time which is strictly the Lord's."—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 702.
    13. What serious charge is brought against religious leaders?
What does a failure to make a distinction between holy and common
time do to the Lord? Eze. 22:26.
    NOTE.—" We must be guarded, lest the lax practices that prevail among
Sundaykeepers shall be followed by those who profess to observe God's holy
rest day. The line of demarcation is to be made clear and distinct between those
who bear the mark of God's kingdom and those who bear the sign of the king-
dom of rebellion."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 353.

                             True Reformers
   14. What awakening message is to be given the church just
before the return of Christ? Joel 2:1; Isa. 58:1, 2.
   15. In the reformation called for, what is to be rebuilt? What
are the reformers called? What will many refuse to do?, Isa. 58)12;
Jer. 6d6.
                             - [ 12]-
    16. What carefulness in Sabbath observance is demanded of
those who repair the breach? What will the Sabbath then become
to them? Isa. 58:13, 14.
    NOTE.—"The Sabbath is a golden clasp that unites God and His people.
But the Sabbath command has been broken. God's holy day has been dese-
crated. . . . A breach has been made in the law, and this breach is to be re-
paired. The true Sabbath is to be exalted to its rightful position as God's rest
day. In the fifty-eighth chapter of Isaiah is outlined the work which God's
people are to do."—Testimonies, vol. 6, pp. 351, 352.
    "God requires not only that we refrain from physical labor upon the Sab-
bath but that the mind be disciplined to dwell upon sacred themes. The fourth
commandment is virtually transgressed by conversing upon worldly things, or
by engaging in light and trifling conversation. Talking upon anything or every-
thing which may come into the mind, is speaking our own words. Every devi-
ation from right brings us into bondage and condemnation."—Testimonies, vol.
2, p. 703.

  17. What assurance of uninterrupted Sabbath observance is
made in connection with the new earth's existence? Isa. 66:22, 23.



                     Lesson 5, for January 31, 1948

                   The Kingdom of Antichrist
    MEMORY VERSE: "For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess
not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist." 2 John 7.
   STUDY HELP: "The Great Controversy," pages 49-60 (new edition, pages 55-67.)


                           Two Rival Kingdoms
   1. Of what two rival kingdoms did Jesus speak? What titles are
applied to the ruler of the enemy kingdom? Matt. 12:24-28.
   NOTE. "There are only two kingdoms in this world, the kingdom of Christ
and the kingdom of Satan. To one of these kingdoms each one of us must be-
long."—Medical Ministry, page 218.
   "Fallen angels upon earth form confederations with evil men. In this age
antichrist will appear as the true Christ, and then the law of God will be fully
made void in the nations of our world. Rebellion against God's holy law will
be fully ripe. But the true leader of all this rebellion is Satan clothed as an
angel of light. Men will be deceived and will exalt him to the place of God, and
deify him."—Testimonies to Ministers, page 62.
   2. How is the kingdom of darkness elsewhere described? What
admonition and assurance is given to the Christian soldier? Eph.
6:11-13.

    NOTE.—"Day by day the battle goes on. If our eyes could be opened to see
the godd and evil agencies at work, there would be..no trifling, no vanity, no
jesting or joking., If all would put on the whole armor of God and fight man;
                                         — [,1,3] —
fully the battles of the Lord, victories would be gained that would cause the
kingdom of darkness to tremble."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 41.

   3. What condition makes human beings the agents and children
of Satan? What is seen in the life as evidence of the indwelling of
the great antichrist? Eph. 2:1-3.
   4. What is the result of the casting out of devils? By what instru-
mentality is this accomplished? How many are declared to be
against Christ? Matt. 12:28-30.

                        The Man of Sin
   5. Who are declared to be antichrists? 2 John 7.
   Nom—All who cannot testify that Christ has set up His kingdom in the
heart, and therefore rules the life, are possessed by Satan or his angels and are
antichrists. "Satan has control of all whom God does not especially guard."—
The Great Controversy, page 589.

   6. What apostolic warning is given concerning the coming of
Christ? What would take place in the church to make possible the
revelation of the "man of sin"? 2 Thess. 2:1-3.
   7. What further description is given of the blasphemous career
of the antichrist? Where would his revealing and exaltation take
place? 2 Thess. 2:4.

   8. How is the ambition of Lucifer to exalt himself to the place
of God described by Isaiah? What prediction of final failure is
made? Isa. 14:12-15.

   9. What offer of world sovereignty in exchange for worship and
allegiance did Satan make to Christ? In what words did Jesus spurn
the proposition? Luke 4:5-8. See margin, verse 7.
     NOTE.—"When Adam sinned, man broke away from the heaven-ordained
center. A demon became the central power in the world. Where God's throne
should have been, Satan had placed his throne. The world laid its homage, as
a willing offering, at the feet of the enemy. Who could bring in the principles
ordained by God in His rule and government to counterwork the plans of Sa-
tan, and bring the world back to its loyalty? God said, 'I will send My Son.'
. . . This is the remedy for sin. Christ says: 'Where Satan has set his throne,
there shall stand My cross. Satan shall be cast out, and I will be lifted up to
draw all men unto Me. I will become the center of the redeemed world. The
Lord God shall be exalted.' "—Testimonies, vol. 6, pp. 236, 237.

   10. Under what symbol did the prophet Daniel describe a power
in opposition to the Most High? What spirit of exaltation and law-
lessness did this power manifest? Dan. 7:8, 25, first part.
                              - [ 14 I -
                         Antichrist and God's Law
    11. Through what human agency did Satan reveal himself in the
church and thus fulfill the predictions of Daniel and Paul?
    Answer: The papacy.
    NoTE.—"This compromise between paganism and Christianity resulted in
the development of the 'man of sin' foretold in prophecy as opposing and ex-
alting himself above God. That gigantic system of false religion is a master-
piece of Satan's power,—a monument of his efforts to seat himself upon the
throne to rule the earth according to his will. Satan once endeavored to form a
compromise with Christ. . . . Christ rebuked the presumptuous tempter, and
forced him to depart. But Satan meets with greater success in presenting the
same temptations to man. To secure worldly gains and honors, the church
was led to seek the favor and support of the great men of earth; and having
thus rejected Christ, she was induced to yield allegiance to the representative
of Satan,—the bishop of Rome."—The Great Controversy, page 50.
    12. What would the lawless antichrist seek to change? How
long would the saints and laws of the Most High be given into his
power? Dan. 7:25, last part.
    NorE.—The Douay or Catholic English Bible reads: "And he shall think
himself able to change times and laws." That the papacy does claim such ability
and authority is evident from the following:
    "The Pope is of so great authority and power that he can modify, explain,
or interpret even divine laws." "The Pope can modify divine law, since his
power is not of man but of God, and he acts as vicegerent of God upon earth
with most ample power of binding and loosing his sheep."—Ferraris, Ecclesias-
tical Dictionary (Catholic), article, "Pope."
    13. What part of the law of God especially has the papacy sought
to change?
    Answer: The Sabbath commandment.
    NOTE.—"The church is above the Bible; and this transference of Sabbath
observance from Saturday to Sunday is proof of that fact. Deny the authority
of the church, and you have no adequate or reasonable explanation or justifica-
tion for the substitution of Sunday for Saturday.".,--The Catholic Record, Lon-
don, Ontario, Sept. 1, 1923.

  14. What has God designed the Sabbath to be in relation to
Himself and His people? Ex. 31:13, 17; Eze. 20:12, 20.
    15. What do the "beast" powers have to distinguish their sub-
jects? How many will be compelled to receive this "mark" or
"sign"? What will finally be the penalty for disobedience? Rev.
13:15-17.
    NoTE.—"Of course the Catholic Church claims that the change was her act.
It could not have been otherwise, as none in those days would have dreamed of
doing anything in matters spiritual and religious without her, and the act is a
mark of her ecclesiastical power and authority in religious matters."—Cardinal
Gibbons, in The Catholic Mirror, Sept. 23, 1893.
    "Satan is working to the utmost to make himself as God, and to destroy all
                                    - . f 15 1 -
who oppose his power. And today the world is bowing before him. His power
is received as the power of God. The prophecy of the Revelation is being ful-
filled, that `all the world wondered after the beast.' "—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 14.
    16. What fearful warning is given by those who have the seal,
sign, or mark of the character of God? How are the messengers
described? Rev. 14:9-12.
    Norn.—"The sign, or seal, of God is revealed in the observance of the sev-
enth-day Sabbath, the Lord's memorial of creation. . . . The mark of the
beast is the opposite of this,—the observance of the first day of the week. This
mark distinguishes those who acknowledge the supremacy of the papal author-
ity from those who acknowledge the authority of God."—Testimonies, vol. 8,
p. 117.
    Dr. Edward Hiscox, author of The Baptist Manual, said in a paper on "The
Transference of the Sabbath": "Of course I quite well know that Sunday did
come into use in early Christian history as a religious day, as we learn from the
Christian Fathers and other sources. But what a pity that it comes branded
with the mark of paganism, and christened with the name of the sun god, then
adopted and sanctified by the papal apostasy, and bequeathed as a sacred
legacy to Protestantism !" "There was and is a commandment to `keep holy the
Sabbath day,' but that Sabbath was not Sunday."—Read before a New York
ministers' conference, held Nov. 13, 1893, and referred to in the New York
Examiner of Nov. 16, 1893.

   17. Over what do God's people gain their final victory? Where
are they seen and how do they celebrate their triumph? Rev. 15:2, 3.
   NorE.—"The mark of the beast is exactly what it has been proclaimed to
be. Not all in regard to this matter is yet understood, nor will it be under-
stood until the unrolling of the scroll."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 17.
   The victory is over the beast, his image, his mark, his name, and the num-
ber of his name. See also Rev. 13:17, 18. "Name" stands for character. Prov.
22:1. Just as the Sabbath is the outward mark or sign of the character of God,
so Sunday is the outward sign or mark of the character of Satan and his reli-
gion.

                    Lesson 6, for Feburary 7, 1948
                         The Two Mysteries
    MEMORY VERSE: "Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath
translated us into the kingdom of His dear Son." Col. 1:13.
   STUDY HELPS: "Early Writings," pages 213-217; "The Desire of Ages," pages
19-26.
                         The Mystery of Iniquity
    1. How does the apostle Paul describe the rise and apparent
success of the kingdom of antichrist in the last days? 2 Thesi. 2:3, 4.
    Nora—The "temple of God" or His "dwelling place" (1 Kings 8:30) may
refer (1) to the sanctuary in heaven (Rev. 11:1, 19), (2) to His church (Matt.
16:18; 2 Peter 2:5), or (3) to the individual in whose heart Christ abides by
His Holy Spirit (Isa. 57:15). Thus we may fittingly speak, as is done in this
lesson, of the "church-temple," or of the "soul-temple." In all three of these
                                     1 16.1-
spheres, Satan, as the antichrist, the man of sin, the son of perdition, and the
mystery of iniquity, has sought to place his throne and thus to supplant the
rightful king.

   2. What does the apostle call this antichristian power, who was
to be manifested in the church-temple? When did he begin working,
and what made possible his revelation? 2 Thess. 2:6-8.
   NorE.—As already noted, Satan is the arch antichrist, but he operates
through agents. So here, the "mystery of iniquity" is primarily Satan himself,
and secondarily his counterfeit system of religion.
   "Satan works with his crooked, deceiving power and through strong de-
lusions he catches all who do not abide in the truth,' who have turned away
their ears from the truth, and have turned unto fables. Satan himself abode
not in the truth; he is the mystery of iniquity."—Testimonies to Ministers,
page 365.

   3. How will the deceiving power of the mystery of iniquity be
especially manifested? When will these "lying wonders" be per-
formed and who will be deceived? 2 Thess. 2:9-12.
   Nors.—"All need wisdom carefully to search out the mystery of iniquity
that figures so largely in the winding up of this earth's history. . . . In the very
time in which we live, the Lord has called His people and has given them a
message to bear. He has called them to expose the wickedness of the man of
sin."—Testimonies to Ministers, page 118.
    "The time is at hand when Satan will work miracles to confirm minds in
the belief that he is God."—Medical Ministry, page 14.

    4. By whom will these false miracles be performed and for what
purpose? How great will be their deceiving power? Matt. 24:24;
Rev. 13:13, '14.
   NorE.—"Fearful sights of a supernatural character will soon be revealed in
the heavens, in token of the power of miracle-working demons. The spirits of
devils will go forth to the kings of the earth and to the whole world, to fasten
them in deception, and urge them on to unite with Satan in his last struggle
against the government of heaven. By these agencies, rulers and subjects will
be alike deceived. Persons will arise pretending to be Christ Himself, and
claiming the title and worship which belong to the world's Redeemer. They
will perform wonderful miracles of healing."—The Great Controversy, page
624.
                         The Crowning Deception
     5. What final effort will Satan make to prove that he is God and
 to receive worship as God?
     Answer: He will be "revealed," or will appear in person, pretending to be
 Christ. See 2 Cor. 11:14.
     Nora.—"As the crowning act in the great drama of deception, Satan him-
 self will personate Christ. . . . In different parts of the earth, Satan will
 manifest himself among men as a majestic being of dazzling brightness, re-
 sembling the description of the Son of God given by John in the Revelation.
 The glory that surrounds him is unsurpassed by anything that mortal eyes have
                                    — [ 17 ] -
yet beheld. The shout of triumph rings out upon the air, 'Christ has come !
Christ has come I' The people prostrate themselves in adoration before him.
. . . But the people of God will not be misled."—The Great Controversy,
pages 624, 625.

   6. In what temple does the Spirit of God dwell? What will
befall all who permit the soul-temple to be defiled or polluted?
1 Cor. 3:16, 17. Who seeks to rule in this temple? See Note.
    NoTE.—"Satan is trying to set up his throne in the soul-temple. When he
reigns, he makes himself heard and felt in angry passions, in words of bitter-
ness that grieve and wound."—Testimonies, vol 4, p. 346.
   "If we do not co-operate with the heavenly agencies, Satan will take pos-
session of the heart, and will make it his abiding place. The only defense
against evil is the indwelling of Christ in the heart through faith in His right-
eousness."—The Desire of Ages, page 324.

   7. What does Satan become to those over whose heart-kingdom
he rules? What are they called? Eph. 2:2.
    NoTE.—Satan enthroned in the soul-temple is the secret or mystery of in-
iquity or disobedience in the life. It is the "man of sin" who produces a life
of sin.
    "If you harbor pride, self-esteem, a love for the Supremacy, vainglory, un-
holy ambition, murmuring, discontent, bitterness, evilspeaking, lying, decep-
tion, slandering, you have not Christ abiding in your heart, and the evidence
shows that you have the mind and character of Satan."—Testimonies to Minis-
ters, page 441.

   8. What is declared to be the purpose of the gospel? By whom
are Satan and his angels cast out of the soul-temple? What then
comes to the delivered individual? Matt. 10:1, 7, 8; 12:28.

                        The Mystery of Godliness
   9. Through whom does Christ occupy the soul-temple? To
whom does it belong and why? Who alone should receive honor
and glory? 1 Cor. 6:19, 20.
    NOTE.—"Those who see Christ in His true character, and receive Him into
the heart, have everlasting life. It is through the Spirit that Christ dwells in
us; and the Spirit of God, received into the heart by faith, is the beginning of
the life eternal."—The Desire of Ages, page 388.

  10. What is the incarnation and manifestation of Christ in
human flesh called? For what did Paul pray? 1 Tim. 3:16; Eph. 6:19.
   11. How is the mystery of godliness again defined? What
standard of righteousness can thus be reached? Col. 1:27, 28.
    NoTE.—"The life of Christ in you produces the same fruits as in Him.
Living in Christ, adhering to Christ, supported by Christ, drawing nourish-
ment from Christ, you bear fruit after the similitude of Christ."—The Desire
of Ages, page 677.
                                  - 18 7 -
   12. What statement indicates that Christ Himself is the secret
or mystery of godliness? How does He work within the heart? Col.
1:29.
    NOTE.—As the mystery of iniquity is primarily Satan and secondarily his
religion, so the mystery of godliness is primarily Christ and secondarily the
gospel message. "That they may know the mystery of God, even Christ."
Col. 2: 2, R. V.


  13. What is said of the number of antichrists in the last days?
How are they identified? 1 John 2:18, 20.

                        The Assurance of Victory
   14. How many are included in these last-day antichrists? What
comparison is made between the two rulers seeking possession of
the soul-temple? 1 John 4:2-4.
   NOTE.—"Many look on this conflict between Christ and Satan as having no
special bearing on their own life ; and for them it has little interest. But within
the domain of every human heart this controversy is repeated."—The Desire
of Ages, page 117.

  15. How securely was Christ kept from "the prince of this
world"? What precious promise is made to those in whose hearts
Christ dwells? John 14:30; 1 John 5:18, 19.
  NOTE.—"The soul that is yielded to Christ becomes His own fortress, which
He holds in a revolted world, and He intends that no authority shall be known
in it but His own. A soul thus kept in possession by the heavenly agencies is
impregnable to the assaults of Satan."—The Desire of Ages, page 324.

   16. Where did Jesus say the kingdom of God is? Luke 17:20, 21.
    NoTE.—"By the life we live through the grace of Christ, the character is
formed. The original loveliness begins to be restored to the soul. The attributes
of the character of Christ are imparted, and the image of the Divine begins to
shine forth. The faces of men and women who walk and work with God ex-
press the peace of heaven. They are surrounded with the atmosphere of
heaven. For these souls the kingdom of God has begun."—The Desire of Ages,
page 312.

   17. What reason for thanksgiving does Paul set forth? Col. 1:12,
13.

   18. What indicates Christ's earnest desire to enter and possess
the soul-temple of His remnant people? What promise of reward
is made? Rev. 3:20, 21.

                    Lesson 7, for February 14, 1948
                 The Symbol of Righteousness
    MEMORY VERSE: "And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine
linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints." Rev. 19:8.
    STUDY HELP: "Christ's Object Lessons," pages 307-319 (new edition, pages
313-325).

                     The Christian's Armor
                                                         •
   1. What is the secret of victory in the warfare with Satan and
his kingdom? What is declared to be the most important part of
the defense armor? Eph. 6:11, 16.
  2. What is the Christian soldier's armor called by the apostle in
another epistle? 2 Cor. 6:7.
  NOTE.—"Clad in the armor of Christ's righteousness, the church is to enter
upon her final conflict."—Prophets and Kings, page 725.
    "On Christ's coronation day He will not acknowledge as His any who bear
spot or wrinkle or any such thing. But to His faithful ones He will give crowns
of immortal glory. Those who would not that He should reign over them
will see Him surrounded by the army of the redeemed, each of whom bears the
sign, the Lord our righteousness."—Mrs. E. G. White, Review and Herald,
Nov. 24, 1904.

   3. Who does the psalmist say is his defense? Ps. 18:2; 94:22;
119:114.

    4. What are those who know the time admonished to do? How
is the "armor of light" put on? Rom. 13:11, 12, 14.

                       Union With Christ
  5. What symbol ig used in Scripture to represent the church of
Christ? Jer. 6:2; 2 Cor. 11:2.
  NOTE.—"Christ honored the marriage relation by making it also a symbol
of the union between Him and His redeemed ones. He Himself is the Bride-
groom; the bride is the church, of which, as His chosen one, He says, 'Thou
art all fair, My love; there is no spot in thee.'"--The Ministry of Healing,
page 356. •

   6. How is the relation between Christ and His church described
in another scripture? By what means is the church cleansed, and
how is the church described? Eph. 5:23-27.
   NOTE.—"In both the Old and the New Testament, the marriage relation is
employed to represent the tender and sacred union that exists between Christ
and His people. To the mind of Jesus the gladness of the wedding festivities
pointed forward to the rejoicing of that day when He shall bring home His
bride to the Father's house, and the redeemed with the Redeemer shall sit
down to the marriage supper of the Lamb. He says, 'As the bridegroom re-
joiceth over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over thee.'   shalt no more
                                     - [ 20 1 —
be termed Forsaken; . . . but thou shalt be called My Delight; . . . for
the Lord delighteth in thee.' He will rejoice over thee with joy; He will rest in
His love, He will joy over thee with singing.' "—The Desire of Ages, page 451.

   7. How is the final awakening of the sleeping church described
by the prophet Isaiah? What preparation is called for? • What de-
liverance is to be wrought? Isi. 52:1-3.
   8. How are the "beautiful garments" of the bride defined? Who
will furnish the garments and robe for the bride? Isa. 61:10.

   9. In John's vision of "the marriage of the Lamb," to what is
the righteousness of the saints likened? Rev. 19:7, 8.
   NOTE.-"By the wedding garment in the' parable [Matt. 22:1-14] is repre-
sented the pure, spotless character which Christ's true followers will possess. To
the church it is given 'that she should be arrayed in, fine linen, clean and white,'
`not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing.' The fine linen,' says the
Scripture, 'is the righteousness of saints.' It is the righteousness of Christ, His
own unblemished character, that through faith is imparted to all who receive
Him as their personal Saviour."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 310.
   10. What instruction did the Lord give to Israel regarding their
dress? Of what was it to be a reminder? From what would it keep
them? Num. 15:37-40.
    Nom.—"Christians should not take pains to make themselves gazingstocks
by dressing different from the world. But if, in accordance with their faith
and duty in respect to their dressing modestly and healthfully, they find them-
selves out of fashion, they should not change their dress in order to be like
the world. But they should manifest a noble independence and moral courage
to be right, if all the world differs from them. If the world introduces a modest,
convenient, and healthful mode of dress, which is in accordance with the Bible,
it will not change our relation to God or to the world to adopt such a style of
dress. Christians should follow Christ, and conform their dress to God's word.
They should shun extremes. They should humbly pursue a straightforward
course, irrespective of applause or of censure, and should cling to the right
because of its own merits.
   "The Bible teaches modesty in dress. 'In like manner also, that women
adorn themselves in modest apparel.' 1 Tim. 2:9. This forbids display in
dress, gaudy colors, profuse ornamentation. Any device designed to attract
attention to the wearer or to excite admiration is excluded from the modest
apparel which God's word enjoins."—Messages to Young People, pages
350, 351.

    11. What New Testament instruction forbids the wearing of
 ornaments and apparel merely for show? Of what should the
 Christian's dress give evidence? What is said of the holy women
 of old? 1 Peter 3:3-5.                     •
    &OTE.—"Iii dress,- as in all things else, it is our privilege to honor our
 Creator. He desires our clothing to be not only neat and healthful, but
 apprOpriate and becoming.' A person's character is judged by his style of
 dress. A refilled taste, a cultivated mind, will be revealed in the choice of simple
                                        - [ 21 ] -
and appropriate attire. Chaste simplicity in dress, when united with modesty
of demeanor, will go far toward surrounding a young woman with that
atmosphere of sacred reserve which will be to her a shield from a thousand
perils. . . . Let the youth and the little children be taught to choose for
themselves that royal robe woven in heaven's loom,—the 'fine linen, clean and
white,' which all the holy ones of earth will wear. This robe, Christ's own
spotless character, is freely offered to every human being. But all who receive
it will receive and wear it here."—Education, pages 248, 249.

                         The True and the False
     12. How is the apostate church of Satan symbolized in the
Apocalypse? What is she called and how is she "arrayed" and
"decked"? Rev. 17:1-5.
     NoTE.—"Babylon" is here used to describe the great apostate church, which
is gaudily arrayed to attract the unwary. False teaching and wickedness are
hidden under a gilded exterior. Similarly the world always endeavors to pre-
sent an attractive appearance, even though it is inwardly corrupt. We should
learn from this that a pure soul and high ideals are more important than "gold
and precious stones and pearls" and all the other adornments that may have
little relation to inward worth.

    13. In contrast, how are the church of Christ and her robe of
righteousness symbolized in another vision? Rev. 12:1.
   NoTE.—Christ is declared to be "the Sun of righteousness" and "the light
of the world." Mal. 4:2; John 8:12. The symbol is that of the Christian
church that is abiding in Christ and has "put on Christ" or His robe of
righteousness. The attire of this symbolic woman is modest, simple, becoming,
and beautiful. She is not "arrayed" and "decked" with gaudy colors and
glittering ornaments. Her beautiful character is her attraction. The same con-
trast between these two symbolic women in appearance will be seen between
individual worldlings and true Christians. Their dress and appearance will
symbolize a righteous or an unrighteous character.


                   Lesson 8, for February 21, 1948
                     Restoring God's Image
   MEMORY VERSE: "Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper
and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth." 3 John 2.
   STUDY HELP: "Counsels on Health," pages 107-140.

                       The First Failure
   1. What is said of man in his original state? What ideal diet
was provided? What provision was made for the preservation of
his physical life? Gen. 1:27, 29; 2:9.
    NOTE.—"As man came forth from the hand of his Creator, he was of lofty
stature and perfect symmetry. His countenance bore the ruddy tint of health,
and glowed with the light of life and joy."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 45.
    "The fruit of the tree of life in the Garden of Eden possessed supernatural
                                      - [ 22 ] —
virtue. To eat of it was to live forever. Its fruit was the antidote of death.
Its leaves were for the sustaining of life and immortality."—Testimonies,
vol. 8, p. 288.
   2. On what point did Satan make his first attack on perfect man?
What threefold appeal caused him to yield? Of what privilege was
he deprived? Gen. 3:5, 6, 22, 24.
   3. On what battleground did Satan first attack Jesus? What
threefold appeal was again made and with what result? Matt. 4:1-11.
    Nora.—All temptations are made by satanic appeals to "the lust of the
flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life." 1 John 2:16. These are
declared to be "all that is in the world." This was the threefold appeal made
to the first Adam and to which he yielded, and again to the second Adam
who resisted and won the victory.
    "In our humanity, Christ was to redeem Adam's failure. . . . With Christ,
as with the holy pair in Eden, appetite was the ground of the first great
temptation. Just where the ruin began, the work of our redemption must
begin. As by the indulgence of appetite Adam fell, so by the denial of appetite
Christ must overcome."—The Desire of Ages, page 117.
   4. What does Christ thus become to the fallen sons and daughters
of Adam? John 1:4; 1 John 5:11, 12.
   NoTE—"The tree of life was a type of the one great Source of immortality.
Of Christ it is written, 'In Him was life; and the life was the light of men.'
He is the fountain of life. Obedience to Him is the life-giving, vivifying power
that gladdens the soul. Through sin man shut himself off from access to the
tree of life. Now, life and immortality are brought to light through Jesus
Christ."—Medical Ministry, pages 233, 234.

                         The Healer
   5. What threefold development is recorded of Jesus as man's
example? Luke 2:40, 52.
  6. In what language does the psalmist declare God to be both
Saviour and Healer? -Which restoration is given first place? Ps.
103:2, 3.
   7. What was the pre-eminent desire of the apostle John for
Gaius? What indicates the close relationship between physical
prosperity and soul prosperity? 3 John 1, 2.
    NoTE.—"When the gospel is received in its purity and power, it is a cure
for the maladies that originated in sin. . . . The love which Christ diffuses
through the whole being is a vitalizing power. Every vital part—the brain,
the heart, the nerves—it touches with healing. . . . It frees the soul from the
guilt and sorrow, the anxiety and care, that crush the life forces. With it come
serenity and composure. It implants in the soul joy that nothing earthly can
destroy,—joy in the Holy Spirit,—health-giving, life-giving joy. . . . If
human beings would open the windows of the soul heavenward, in appreciation
of the divine gifts, a flood of healing virtue would pour in."—The Ministry of
Healing, pages 115, 116.
                                     - [ 23 -
  8. On what condition did the Lord promise Israel health and
immunity from disease? Ex. 15:26; Deut. 7:12, 15.
   9. What was one of the prevailing sins of ancient Israel? How
did disobedience to health principles affect their spiritual state? Ps.
106:13-15. Compare Ex. 16:3.
   NOTE.—"God brought the Israelites from Egypt, that He might establish
them in the land of Canaan, a pure, holy, and happy people. . . . Had they
been willing to deny appetite, in obedience to His wise restrictions, feebleness
and disease would have been unknown among them. Their descendants would
have possessed both physical and mental strength. They would have had clear
perceptions of truth and duty, keen discrimination, and sound judgment."—
Patriarchs and Prophets, page 378.
                         True Temperance
   10. What did Paul list among the gods of his day? Of what did
he declare such worshipers to be enemies? What would be the
results of their lust? Phil. 3:18, 19.
   NoTE.—"The question of how to preserve the health is one of primary im-
portance. . . . God demands that the appetites be cleansed, and that self-denial
be practiced in regard to those things which are not good. This is a work that
will have to be done before His people can stand before Him a perfected
people."—Testimonies, vol. 9, pp. 153, 154.

   11. How did Paul illustrate the Christian warfare? What is
necessary to success? What did he do to his lusting flesh? 1 Cor.
9:24-27.
   NOTE.—"True temperance teaches us to dispense entirely with everything
hurtful, and to use judiciously that which is healthful. There are few who
realize as they should how much their habits of diet have to do with their
health, their character, their usefulness in this world, and their eternal destiny.
The appetite should ever be in subjection to the moral and intellectual powers.
The body should be servant to the mind, and not the mind to the body."—
Patriarchs and Prophets, page 562.

  12. What reason is given why the body should be kept in the
best possible condition? What is the penalty for disobedience to
physical laws? 1 Cor. 3:16, 17.
   13. How much is included in temperance "in all things"? 1 Cor.
10:31.
   NOTE.—"Here is a principle which lies at the foundation of every act,
thought, and motive; the consecration of the entire being, both physical and
mental, to the control of the Spirit of God. The unsanctified will and passions
must be crucified."—Testimonies, vol. 3, p. 84.

             The Spiritual in Relation to the Physical
    14. In Christ's commission to His disciples how closelY were
spiritual and physical ministry to be connected? Which is giVen
first place? Luke 9:1, 2; Matt. 10:1, 7, 8.
                                    - L 24 —
   NOTE.—"The gospel ministry is an organization for the proclamation of
the truth and the carrying forward of the work for sick and well. This is the
body, the medical missionary work is the arm, and Christ is the head over all.
Thus the matter has been presented to me."—Medical Ministry, page 237.
   15. What instruction is given regarding the place of divine
healing in the church? What spiritual blessings are to attend
physical healing? James 5:14, 15.
   16. What threefold restoration will prepare the church for the
coming of the Lord? How complete will be the transformation and
to whom belongs the glory? 1 Thess. 5:23, 24.
   NOTE.—"Those who understand the laws of health and who are governed by
principle, will shun the extremes both of indulgence and of restriction. Their
diet is chosen, not for the mere gratification of appetite, but for the upbuilding
of the body. They seek to preserve every power in the best condition for high-
est service to God and man. The appetite is under the control of reason and
conscience, and they are rewarded with health of body and mind. . . . There
is real common sense in dietetic reform. The subject should be studied broadly
and deeply, and no one should criticize others because their practice is not, in
all things, in harmony with his own."—The Ministry of Healing, page 319.
   17. When will the original physical image of man be fully
restored? What provision to perpetuate life will also be restored?
Mal. 4:2, 3; Rev. 22:1, 2.


                    Lesson 9, for February 28, 1948
                Recognizing God's Ownership
   MEMORY VERSE: "The earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof: the world,
and they that dwell therein." Ps. 24:1.
   STUDY HELP: "Patriarchs and Prophets," pages 525-529.

                    The Tests of Loyalty
  1. To whom do the earth and all things on it belong? How
much does His ownership include? Ps. 24:1; 50:10-12; Hag. 2:8.
   2. What was one purpose of the plagues that were poured out
on Egypt? Ex. 9:27-29.
    3. What is lean in danger of saying? Why should all credit be
 given to the Lord? Deut. 8:17, 18.
   4. What evidence of His ownership did the Lord give Adam and
 Eve? How particular was He that they should not appropriate that
 which He had denied them for their own use? Gen. 2:9, 16, 17.
    NOTE.—The great test that came to our first parents concerned implicit
 obedience to God. First, they were to have faith in God to the extent of ac-
 cepting the command not to touch the forbidden fruit. Secondly, they were to
                                  - 25.1 -
resist ambitions which went beyond God's permission; that is, the desire to
know evil as well as good. Thirdly, the appetites were to be controlled, and
things which appeared desirable were to be rejected if not in harmony with
God's will. "Thus He gave them opportunity to demonstrate their faith and
trust in Him by their perfect obedience to His requirements."—Testimonies,
vol. 6, p. 386.
                             God's Ownership
      5. Since the removal of the original sign of ownership, what
property reservation has the Lord made? What distinction does
He make between the reserved portion and the whole? Lev.
27:30, 32.
     Nora.—"So it is with God's claims upon us. He places His treasures in the
hands of men, but requires that one tenth shall be faithfully laid aside for His
work. He requires this portion to be placed in His treasury. It is to be ren-
dered to Him as His own; it is sacred, and is to be used for sacred purposes.
. . . By faithfully obeying this requirement, we acknowledge that all belongs
to God."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 386.
      6. To what purpose was the tithe dedicated in Israel? Who only
was permitted to use the Lord's portion of Israel's increase? Num.
18:21-24.
     NOTE.—"A great mistake is made when the tithe is drawn from the object
for which it is to be used—the support of the ministers. There should be today
in the field one hundred well-qualified laborers where now there is but one....
There should be an abundant supply in the Lord's treasury, and there would
be if selfish hearts and hands had not withheld the tithes, or made use of them
to support other lines of work. . . . Provision is to be made for these other
lines of work. They are to be sustained, but not from the tithe. God has not
changed; the tithe is still to be used for the support of the ministry."—Testi-
monies, vol. 9, pp. 249, 250.
      7. What was required of the Levites that they also might rec-
ognize God as the owner? Num. 18:26.
    8. What was the tithe of God's ministers called? To what place
were all to bring the Lord's portion? Neh. 10:38, 39.
    NoTE.—"That which has been set apart according to the Scriptures as be-
longing to the Lord, constitutes the revenue of the gospel, and is no longer ours.
It is no better than sacrilege for a man to take from God's treasury in order to
serve himself or to serve others in their secular business. . . . Let no one, when
brought into a strait place, take money consecrated to religious purposes, and
use it for his advantage, soothing his conscience by saying that he will repay it
at some future time."—Testimonies, vol. 9, pp. 246, 247.
                          Faithfulness in Tithing
   9. Besides laxness in Sabbathkeeping, in what other matter had
the Jews become careless? What was therefore the condition of
God's house and its services? Neh. 13:10, 11.
  10. What was the result of the reformation led by Nehemiah?
How was the tithe distributed by those who were to be supported
by it? Neh. 13:12, 13.
                             - 261 -
    NOTE.—"Let none feel at liberty to retain their tithe, to use according to
their own judgment. They are not to use it for themselves in an emergency,
nor to apply it as they see fit, even in what they may regard as the Lord's work.
The minister should, by precept and example, teach the people to regard the
tithe as sacred. He should not feel that he can retain and apply it according to
his own judgment, because he is a minister. It is not his. He is not at liberty to
devote to himself whatever he thinks is his due."—Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 247.

   11. In recognition of the gifts of God in temporal and spiritual
blessings, what vow did Jacob make? Gen. 28:20-22.
12. What did Melchizedek declare the Most High God to be?
What did Abraham therefore do? Gen. 14:18-20; Heb. 7:4-6.
   13. What scripture shows that the Melchizedek priesthood is
perpetuated in the priesthood of Christ? Heb. 7:1-4, 15-17.

   14. What is the spiritual relationship to Abraham of all who
faithfully serve God? Gal. 3:7, 29.
   15. What will the children of Abraham, including Christians,
therefore do? In what will they also share? John 8:39; Gal. 3:9.

                             True Stewardship
   16. What serious charge did the Lord bring against Israel? On
what conditions would He return to them? What neglect had caused
the alienation? Mal. 3:7, 8.
    NoTE.—"God lays His hand upon all man's possessions, saying, I am the
owner of the universe, and these goods are Mine. The tithe you have withheld
I reserv,ed for the support of My servants in their work of opening the Scrip-
tures to those who are in the regions of darkness, who do not understand My
law. In using My reserve fund to gratify your own desires, you have robbed
souls of the. light which I made provision for them to receive. You have had
opportunity to show loyalty to Me, but you have not done this. You have
robbed Me; you have stolen My reserve fund. 'Ye are cursed with a curse.'"—
 Testimonies, vol. 6, p.387.

    17. What commandment is violated in the withholding-of the
tithe? What besides the tenth is mentioned? How universal was
the guilt of Israel? Mal. 3:8, 9.
   NOTE.—"Every Christian is a steward of God, entrusted with His goods.
Remember the words, 'Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be
found faithful.' 1 Cor. 4:2. Let us be sure that we are not robbing God in any
jots or tittles; for much is involved in this question."—Testimonies, vol. 9, p.
246.

   18. What great blessings are promised to those who faithfully
bring a full tenth into the Lord's treasury? What will be the attitude
of the world toward such a tithe-paying people? Mal. 3:10-12.
                                - [ 27 —
    NOTE.—"If professing Christians would faithfully bring to God their tithes
and offerings, His treasury would be full. There would then be no occasion to
resort to fairs, lotteries, or parties of pleasure to secure funds for the support
of the gospel."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 338.


                     Lesson 10, for March 6, 1948
                    Ordinances — Memorials
   MEMORY VERSE: "He that eateth My flesh, and drinketh My blood, dwelleth
in Me, and I in Him." John 6:56.
   STUDY HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pages 642-661.

                               True Humility
    1. What were the typical services of the earthly sanctuary called?
In what did they consist? What did they prefigure? Heb. 9:1, 9-11.
    NgrE.—"The system of Jewish economy was the gospel in figure, a presen-
tation of Christianity which was to be developed as fast as the minds of the
people could comprehend spiritual light. Satan ever seeks to make obscure the
truths that are plain, and Christ ever seeks to open the mind to comprehend
every essential truth concerning the salvation of fallen man. To this day there
are still aspects pf truth which are dimly seen, connections that are not under-
stood, and far-reaching depths in the law of God that are uncomprehended."—
Fundamentals of Christian Education, page 238.
   2. What high position did Jesus occupy in heaven before. His
incarnation? What spirit brought Him to earth and led Him to
Calvary? How only is it possible for us to manifest the same spirit?
Phil. 2:5-8.
    3. While fully conscious of His former and future position and
glory, how did Jesus manifest the spirit of humility and service that
controlled Him? John 13:1-5.
    NOTE.—"He had a full consciousness of His divinity ; but He had laid aside
His royal crown and kingly robes, and had taken the form of a servant. One
of the last acts of His life on earth was to gird Himself as a servant, and
perform a servant's part."—The Desire of Ages, page 645.
    4. Embarrassed by his own lack' of humility, what protest did
impetuous Peter make? What statements of Jesus show that His
act was symbolic of a spiritual cleansing? John 13:6-10.
    NOTE.—"The service which Peter refused was the type of a higher cleans-
ing. Christ had come to wash the heart from the stain of sin. In refusing to
allow Christ to wash his feet, Peter was refusing the higher cleansing included
in the lower. He was really rejecting his Lord. . . . These words mean more
than bodily cleanliness. . . . He who. came from the bath was clean, but the
sandaled feet soon became dusty, and again needed to be washed. So Peter and
his brethren had been washed in the great fountain opened for sin and unclean-
ness. Christ acknowledged them as His. But temptation had led them into
evil, and they still needed His cleansing grace. When Jesus girded Himself with
a towel to wash the dust from their feet, He desired by that, very act. to wash
                                       [ 28 ) —
the alienation, jealousy, and pride from their hearts. . . . Their hearts must
be cleansed. Pride and self-seeking create dissension and hatred, but all this
Jesus washed away in washing their feet. A change of feeling was brought
about. Looking upon them, Jesus could say, 'Ye are clean' . . . Like Peter
and his brethren, we too have been washed in the blood of Christ, yet often
through contact with evil the heart's purity is soiled. We must come to Christ
for His cleansing grace."—The Desire of Ages, page 646.

                         Typical Ordinances
   5. By what question did Jesus indicate that the disciples did not
comprehend the significance of His symbolic act? By what state-
ment did He declare the service to be a Christian ordinance? John
13:12-15.
   6. What is named as one of the principal typical ordinances?
How many we're to observe it? Who were not permitted to take
part? Ex. 12:43, 47, 48.
   7. How was it emphasized that all must partake of this ordi-
nance? What happened to those who refused to show faith in Him
whom the Passover typified? Num. 9:10, 12, 13.
   8. In whom and in what event did the Passover meet its antirype?
How is the feast that commemorates Christ's death to be celebrated?
1 Cor. 5:7, 8.
    Nom.—"Christ was standing at the point of transition between two econo-
mies and their two great festivals. . . . As He ate the Passover with His dis-
ciples, He instituted in its place the service that was to be the memorial of His
great sacrifice. The national festival of the Jews was to pass away forever.
The service which Christ established was to be observed by His followers in
all lands and through all ages."—The Desire of Ages, page 652.

                 Remembering the Lord's Death
   9. On what condition is salvation possible? What three im-
portant events must not be forgotten? 1 Cor. 15:1-4.
   10. What record does the apostle Paul give of the institution of
the memorial of Christ's death? What symbols were employed?
1 Cor. 11:23-25.
    NOTE.—"None should exclude themselizes from the Communion because
some who are unworthy may be present. Every disciple is called upon to par-
ticipate publicly, and thus bear witness that he accepts Christ as a personal
Saviour. It is at these, His own appointments, that Christ meets His people,
and energizes them by His presence. Hearts and hands that are unworthy may
even administer the ordinance, yet Christ is there to minister to His children.
All who come with their faith fixed upon Him will be greatly blessed. All who
neglect these seasons of divine privilege will suffer loss. Of them it may ap-
propriately be said, 'Ye are not all clean.' "—The Desire of Ages, page 656.
   11. How long are these memorials to be celebrated? What
preparation should each person make? What lack of discernment
will bring damnation? 1 Cor. 11:26-29.
                            - [ 29 ]
             Outward Evidence of Renewed Life
   12. What ordinance commemorates the burial and resurrection
of Jesus? What change in the affections should take place in those
baptized? Col. 2:12; 3:1, 2.
    NOTE.—"Christ has made baptism the sign of entrance to His spiritual king-
dom. . . . Baptism is a most solemn renunciation of the world. Those who
are baptized in the threefold name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,
at the very entrance of their Christian life declare publicly that they have for-
saken the service of Satan, and have become members of the royal family, chil-
chtn of the heavenly King."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 91.
   13. In what language does the apostle show that baptism repre-
sents a death to sin and a spiritual resurrection to a new life?
Col. 3:3-5.
   14. What other Scriptural statement clearly shows that baptism
is a memorial of the burial and resurrection of Christ? Of what
should the mode of baptism therefore be a likeness? Rom. 6:3-5.
   15. What of necessity must precede a baptismal burial and resur-
rection? What further proof is given that baptism is an outward
sign of an inward cleansing from sin? Rom. 6:6-8.
  16. When baptism is truly the outward sign of a renewed char-
acter, what may the Christian do by faith? Under what does he
henceforth live? Rom. 6:11-14.
   17. How do we become children of God? What should be the
outward evidence of this new family relationship? Gal. 3:26, 27.
    NOTE.—"The vows which we take upon ourselves in baptism embrace
much. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, we are buried
in the likeness of Christ's death, and raised in the likeness of His resurrection,
and we are to live a new life. Our life is to be bound up with the life of Christ.
Henceforth the believer is to bear in mind that he is dedicated to God, to Christ,
and to the Holy Spirit."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 98.
    "Those who have put on Christ by baptism, by this act showing their separ-
ation from the world, and that they have covenanted to walk in newness of
life, should not set up idols in their hearts."—Testimonies, vol. 3, p. 365.



                     Lesson 11, for March 13, 1948
                     The Gifts of the Spirit
   MEMORY VERSE: "And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the
greatest of these is charity." 1 Cor. 13:13.
   STUDY HELP: "Christ's Object Lessons," pages 327, 328 (new edition, pages
329, 330).
                   God's Gifts to His Church
   1. Who is the source of all our blessings? What is said regarding
the unchangeable nature of our great Benefactor? James 1:17.
                                [ 30 ] —
   2. In what great gift did the Father demonstrate His infinite love?
What other member of the Godhead is declared to be a gift to man?
John 3:16; Acts 10:44, 45.
  NOTE.—"The Holy Spirit was the highest of all gifts that He could solicit
from His Father for the exaltation of His people. The Spirit was to be given
as a regenerating agent, and without this the sacrifice of Christ would have
been of no avail."—The Desire of Ages, page 671.
   3. As Christ ascended on high what special gifts did He bestow
upon men? Eph. 4:8, 11, margin.
   4. For what purpose were these gifts bestowed? How long are
they to remain in the church? How completely will they accomplish
their divinely appointed work? Eph. 4:12, 13.
   5. What stabilizing influence will these gifts exert? How are
the results of these gifts in spiritual growth again described? Eph.
4:14-16.
   6. What are the gifts of God to the church called and why?
What emphasis is given to the importance of understanding this
subject? 1 Cor. 12:1.
             The Purpose of the Gifts of the Spirit
   7. What three diversities are mentioned as pertaining to spiritual
gifts? What makes unity in diversity possible? 1 Cor. 12:4-6.
   8. What is the purpose of these manifestations of the Spirit?
What gifts are enumerated as being profitable to the individuals
who receive them and to the church they serve? 1 Cor. 12:7-10.
   NOTE.—"The talents that Christ entrusts to His church represent especially
the gifts and blessings imparted by the Holy Spirit. . . . All men do not re-
ceive the same gifts, but to every servant of the Master some gift of the Spirit
is promised."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 327.
   9. What indicates that the gifts and offices in the church are not
to be bestowed by the church? What reasons are given to show
why the Holy Spirit should have full control of the distribution of
gifts? 1 Cor. 12:11-14.
   10. What illustrations show the necessity of a wise distribution
of spiritual gifts among the members of the church body? 1 Cor.
12:15-20.
   NOTE.—"All minds are not molded alike ; and it is well that it is so ; for
if they were exactly similar, there would be less harmony and natural adaptabil-
ity to each other than now. But we are all represented as being members of
the body, united in Christ. In this body there are various members, and one
member cannot perform exactly the same office as another. The eyes are made
for seeing, and in no case can they perform the work of the ears, which is that
of hearing; neither can the ears take the place of the mouth, nor the mouth
perform the office of the nose. Yet all these organs are necessary to the perfect
whole, and work in beautiful harmony with one another. . . . All are united
                                     - [ 31 ] —
to the body, to do their specific work, and should be alike respected, as they
conduce to the comfort and usefulness of the perfect whole."—Testimonies,
vol. 4, p. 128.
   11. What further illustrations from the human body show the
importance of unity and co-operation among those who receive gifts
with diversities of operations? What is said of even the less honored
members in regard to the perfection of the body? 1 Cor. 12:21-24.
   12. Against what are the gifts to safeguard the church? As in
the human body, what should be the attitude of members toward
each other? 1 Cor. 12:25-27.
   NoTE.—"God's people are not to be in confusion, lacking order and har-
mony, consistency and beauty. The Lord is greatly dishonored when disunion
exists among His people. Truth is a unit. The unity that God requires must be
cultivated day by day, if we would answer the prayer of Christ. The disunion
that is striving for existence among those who profess to believe the last mes-
sage of mercy to be given to the world, must find no place; for it would be a
fearful hindrance to the advancement of God's work. His servants are to be
one, as Christ is one with the Father; their powers, illuminated, inspired, and
sanctified, must be united to make a complete whole. Those who love God and
keep His commandments are not to draw apart; they are to press together."—
Testimonies, vol. 8, pp. 174, 175.

                    The Greatest Gift of God
   13. In what order are the spiritual gifts here enumerated? What
questions 'emphasize the fact that all members cannot possess the
same gifts? 1 Cor. 12:28-30.
   14. From what language may it be inferred that all the gifts of
the Spirit will be manifested in the church waiting for the coming
of Christ? What will these gifts do for the members? 1 Cor. 1:7, 8.
   15. What are we thereforeasked to do regarding spiritual gifts?
What indicates that there is something even more valuable than the
enumerated gifts? 1 Cor. 12:31.
   16. What is the more excellent way that should be desired above
the previously named gifts? How is the superiority of love over
these gifts emphasized? 1 Cor. 13:1-3.
   NOTE.—"When love fills the heart, it will flow out to others, not because
of favors received from them, but because love is the principle of action. Love
modifies the character, governs the impulses, subdues enmity, and ennobles the
affections. This love is as broad as the universe, and is in harmony with that
of the angel workers. Cherished in the heart, it sweetens the entire life, and
sheds its blessing upon all around. It is this, and this only, that can make us
the salt of the earth."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, pages 61, 62.
    17. What will eventually become of the gifts of the Spirit?
When will they no longer be needed? Of those things which will
still continue, what is declared to be the greatest? 1 Cor. 13:8-10, 13.
    NOTE.—"No matter how high his profession, he whose heart is not imbued
with love for God and for his fellow men, is not a disciple of Christ. Though
                                   — 32 —
he should possess great faith, and even have power to work miracles, yet with-
out love his faith would be worthless. He might display great liberality, but
should he from some other motive than genuine love, bestow all his goods to
feed the poor, the act would not commend him to the favor of God. In his zeal
he might even meet a martyr's death, yet if destitute of the gold of love, he
would be regarded by God as a deluded enthusiast or an ambitious hypocrite.
. . . This love 'never faileth.' It car; never lose its value; it is the attribute of
Heaven. As a precious treasure, it will be carried by its possessor through the
portals of the city of God. . . . Talents, learning, and eloquence, without this
heavenly attribute, will be as meaningless as sounding brass or a tinkling cym-
bal."—Testimonies, vol. 5, pp. 168, 169.



                     Lesson 12, for March 20, 1948

                      The Spirit of Prophecy
    MEMORY VERSE: "The dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make
war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the
testimony of Jesus Christ." Rev. 12:17.
    STUDY HELP: "Testimonies," vol. 5, pp. 661-672.

                               God's Spokesmen
   1. While seeking an increase of love, what should not be neg-
lected? What spiritual gift is especially emphasized? 1 Cor. 14:1.
   2. How has God spoken to His people? How complete is the
revelation of God's purposes through His prophets? Hosea 12:10;
Amos 3:7.
  3. What kind of instruments are chosen to receive honor as
God's special spokesmen? How is it further emphasized that
prophecy is a gift of the Spirit? 2 Peter 1:21.
  4. What scriptures show that prophecy is one of the gifts of
Christ through the Spirit? Eph. 4:8, 11; 1 Peter 1:10, 11.
                          The Tests of Genuineness
    5. Who is the source of all prophecy? What other agency is
used in bringing God's revelations to the ,prophet? Who is the
angel of prophecy? Rev. 1:1; Dan. 8:16.
   NOTE.—"It was Gabriel, the angel next in rank to the Son of God, who
came with the divine message to Daniel. It was Gabriel, 'His angel,' whom
Christ sent to open the future to the beloved John; and a blessing is pro-
nounced on those who read and hear the words of the prophecy, and keep the
things written therein."—The Desire of Ages, page 234.
    "Of Gabriel the Saviour speaks in the Revelation, saying that 'He sent and
signified it by His angel unto His servant John.' And to John the angel de-
clared, 'I am a fellow servant with thee and with thy brethren the prophets.'
Wonderful thought—that the angel who stands next in honor to the Son of
God, is the one chosen to open the purposes of God to sinful men."—Ibid.,
page 99.
                                  - 33 —
   6. By what tests may it be determined whether a prophet is false
or true? What is the greatest evidence that a prophet is false? Deut.
13:1-4; 18:22; 1 John 4:2, 3.
    NOTE.—"We are not bidden to prove them by their fair speeches and ex-
alted professions. They are to be judged by the word of God. . . . What mes-
sage do these teachers bring? Does it lead you to reverence and fear God?
Does it lead you to manifest your love for Him by loyalty to His command-
ments?" "When the doctrine we accept kills sin in the heart, purifies the soul
from defilement, bears fruit unto holiness, we may know that it is the truth of
God."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, pages 208, 210.
    7. By what great standard are all teachings to be judged? How
is the close connection between the gift of prophetic vision and
the keeping of the law indicated? Isa. 8:20; Prov. 29:18.
    8. Through what means did the Lord lead and preserve "the
church in the wilderness"? What is therefore the secret of pros-
perity in the church? Hosea 12:13; 2 Chron. 20:20.
                   The Importance of Prophecy
   9. What experience of Israel illustrates how the Lord not only
reveals His secrets through His prophet, but also the secrets of the
enemy? How impossible therefore is it for the enemy to hide his
schemes for the destruction of God's people? 2 Kings 6:8-12.
   10. What experience of David shows the importance of the
spirit of prophecy in keeping the church pure? 2 Sam. 12:1-13.
   11. What shows that a prophet is human and when not speak-
ing under direct inspiration may err in his opinions? 2 Sam. 7:1-5,
12, 13.
    NoTE.—"It was David's purpose to make Jerusalem the religious center of
the nation. He had erected a palace for himself, and he felt that it was not
fitting for the ark of God to rest within a tent. He determined to build for it
a temple of such magnificence as should express Israel's appreciation of the
honor granted the nation in the abiding presence of Jehovah their King. Com-
municating his purpose to the prophet Nathan, he received the encouraging
response, 'Do all that is in thine heart; for the Lord is with thee.' But that
same night the word of the Lord came to Nathan, giving him a message for
the king. David was to be deprived of the privilege of building a house for
God. . . . The reason why David was not to build the temple, was declared."
—Patriarchs and Prophets, pages 711, 712.
   12. Against what are the children of God warned? What will
greatly strengthen the deceptive powers of these false prophets?•
1 John 4:1; Matt. 24:24.
   NOTE.—"And Satan, surrounded by evil angels, and claiming to be God,
will work miracles of all kinds, to deceive, if possible, the very elect. God's
people will not find their safety in working miracles; for Satan will counterfeit
the miracles that will be wrought."—Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 16.
   "Even in the midst of the great deceptions of the last days, when delusive
miracles will be performed in the sight of men in behalf of satanic theories, it
                                   - L 34 1 -
is our privilege to hide ourselves in Christ Jesus. It is possible for us to seek
and to obtain salvation. And in this time of unusual peril, we must learn to
stand alone, our faith fixed, not on the word of man, but on the sure promises
of God."—Testimonies to Ministers, page 490.
    13. Although warned against false prophets, how is the church
to regard prophesying? 1 Thess. 5:19-23.
    NoTE.—Wherever there is the true, Satan will institute the false to counter-
feit it. The existence of the false is evidence that there is the genuine of which
the false is a counterfeit. Satan wastes no time inventing counterfeits where the
genuine does not exist.
    "The last great delusion is soon to open before us. Antichrist is to perform
his marvelous works in our sight. So closely will the counterfeit resemble the
true, that it will be impossible to distinguish between them except by the Holy
Scriptures. By their testimony every statement and every miracle must be
tested. . . None but those who have fortified the mind with the truths of the
Bible will stand through the last great conflict."—The Great Controversy, pages
593, 594.
                           Centers of Final Conflict
    14. For what two reasons is Satan angry with the remnant of
the church? What is the testimony of Jesus declared to be? Rev.
12:17; 19:10. .
    NoTE.—The messages of prophets is called "the testimony of Jesus" be-
cause Jesus is "the faithful and true Witness." Rev. 3:14. The word of a wit-
ness is called his testimony. Christ has witnessed through all the holy prophets
since the world began. "It was Christ that spoke to His people through the
prophets. . . . It is the voice of Christ that speaks to us through the Old
Testament. 'The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.'"—Patriarchs
and Prophets, pages 366, 367.
    "In ancient times God spoke to men by the mouth of prophets and apostles.
In these days He speaks to them by the Testimonies of His Spirit. There was
never a time when God instructed His people more earnestly than He instructs
them now concerning His will, and the course that He would have them pursue.
But will they profit by His teachings? will they receive His reproofs and heed
His warnings? God will accept of, no partial obedience.; He will sanction no
compromise with self"—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 148.
    15. What is to be done with both the testimony of Jesus and the
law among those who are waiting and looking for the coming of
Christ? Isa. 8:16, 17.
    Nozz.—"It is Satan's plan to weaken the faith of God's people in the Testi-
monies. Next follows skepticism in regard to the vital points of our faith, the
pillars Of our position, then doubt as to the Holy Scriptures, and then the
downward march to perdition. When the Testimonies, which were once be-
lieved, are doubted and given up, Satan knows the deceived ones will not stop
at this; and he redoubles his efforts till he launches them into open rebellion,
which becomes incurable and ends in destruction."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 211.
    16. How is it further emphasized that the gift of prophecy will
give to the remnant the testimony of Jesus? How many of the gifts
of the Spirit will be manifest? What effect will these gifts have on
the church? 1 Cor. 1:6-8.
                                    - 35 —
    NorE.—"As the end draws near, and the work of giving the last warning to
the world extends, it becomes more important for those who accept present
truth to have a clear understanding of the nature and influence of the Testi-
monies, which God in His providence has linked with the work of the third
angel's message from its very rise."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 654.
    17. Upon whom is a blessing pronounced? What results follow
obedience to the law of the Lord and His testimonies? Ps. 119:1-3.


                    Lesson 13, for March 27, 1948
                Finishing the Mystery of God
   MEMORY VERSE: "For He will finish the work, and cut it short in righteous-
ness : because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth." Rom. 9:28.
   STUDY HELP: "The Acts of the Apostles," pages 47-56.

                       The Final Movements
   1. What symbol is employed to represent the heaven-sent mes-
sage that finishes the gospel work? What pronouncement is made
by the authority of the Creator? Rev. 10:1, 2, 5, 6.
    2. At what time will the mystery of God be finished? What
occurs when the seventh trumpet sounds? Rev. 10:7; 11:15-18.
   NOTE.—The seventh war-scourge is held in check by the four angels until
the servants of God are sealed. Rey. 7:1-4. When the sealing is completed, the
winds of war and human passion will be loosed, and the most dreadful period
of war and strife and trouble ever known will sweep the earth with the besom
of destruction. Present-day conditions testify that God's work on the earth
is about to be finished.
    3. Upon what does the end of the reign of sin depend? What
glorious event will follow a finished gospel work? Matt. 24:14;
25:31, 34.
    NoTE.—"A crisis is right upon us. We must now by the Holy Spirit's power
proclaim the great truths for these last days. It will not be long before every
one will have heard the warning and made his decision. Then shall the end
come."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 24.
    "The last rays of merciful light, the last message of mercy to be given to the
world, is a revelation of His character of love. The children of God are to
manifest His glory. In their own life and character they are to reveal what the
grace of God has done for them."—Christ's Object Lessons, pages 415, 416.
    4. Who has assumed the responsibility for the finishing of the
gospel commission? What change is to come just before the end?
Rom. 9:28.
    NorE.—"Great changes are soon to take place in our world, and the final
movements will be rapid ones."—Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 11.
    "The Lord God of heaven will not send upon the world His judgments for
disobedience and transgression, until He has sent His watchmen to give the
warning. He will not close up the period of probation until the message shall
be more distinctly proclaimed. . . . Yet the work will be cut short in right-
                                     - 36 1 —
eousness. The message of Christ's righteousness is to sound from one end of
the earth to the other to prepare the way of the Lord. This is the glory of God,
which closes the work of the third angel."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 19.
                   Speedy Work in the Church
   5. What similar assurance is given regarding the work in the
individual heart? In time for what event is the Lord able to com-
plete this task? What evidence will be seen in the life? Phil. 1:6,
margin, 11.
                                                                  •
   6. How were the disciples empowered to bear witness to all the
world in apostolic days? Acts 1:5, 8.
    NoTE.—"What we need is the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Without this, we
are no more fitted to go forth to the world than were the disciplekafter the
crucifixion of their Lord. Jesus knew their destitution, and told them to tarry
in Jerusalem until they should be endowed with power from on high."—Mrs.
E. G. White, Review and Herald, Feb. 18, 1890.
   7. What preparation on the part of the early church preceded
the great visitation of the Spirit at Pentecost? What spiritual con-
dition prevailed and what gospel fruitage resulted? Acts 1:14;
2:1, 2, 41.
    NoTE.—"The Spirit came upon the waiting, praying disciples with a full-
ness that reached every heart. The Infinite One revealed Himself in power to
His church. . . . The sword of the Spirit, newly edged with power and bathed
in the lightnings of heaven, cut its way through unbelief. Thousands were con-
verted in a day."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 38.
    "What was the result of the outpouring of the Spirit on the Day of Pente-
cost? The glad tidings of a risen Saviour were carried to the uttermost parts
of the inhabited world. As the disciples proclaimed the message of redeeming
grace, hearts yielded to the power of this message. The church beheld converts
flocking to her from all directions. Backsliders were reconverted. Sinners
united with believers in seeking the pearl of great price."—I bid., page 48.
   8. What must likewise precede the final outpouring of the Spirit
in the latter rain? Zech. 10:1; Acts 3:19.
    NOTE.—"We should pray as earnestly for the descent of the Holy Spirit as
the disciples prayed on the Day of Pentecost. If they needed it at that time, we
need it more today. Moral darkness, like a funeral pall, covers the earth. .
Without the Spirit and power of God, it will be in vain that we labor to pre-
sent the truth."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 158.
   "The Lord calls for a renewal of the straight testimony borne in years past.
He calls for a renewal of spiritual life. The spiritual energies of His people
have long been torpid, but there is to be a resurrection from apparent death.
By prayer and confession of sin we must clear the King's highway. As we do
this, the power of the Spirit will come to us. We need the Pentecostal energy.
This will come; for the Lord has promised to send His Spirit as the all-con-
quering power."—Testimonies, vol. 8, pp. 297, 298.
                 Revival of Primitive Godliness
   9. How will the Lord awaken His church just before the end?
What will the alarm message cause the members to do? Joel 2:1,
12-14.
                                    - L 37 -
   NOTE.—"Before the final visitation of God's judgments upon the earth,
there will be, among the people of the Lord, such a revival of primitive godli-
ness as has not been witnessed since apostolic times. The Spirit and power of
God will be poured out upon His children."—The Great Controversy, page 464.
    10. How earnest will be the ministers of God who sound the
alarm? For what two reasons do they weep and plead with God to
spare His people? Joel 2:17.
    NOTE.—"It is sad that every soul is not praying for the vital breath of the
Spirit; for we are ready to die if it breathe not on us. We are to pray for the
impartation of the Spirit as the remedy for sin-sick souls. The church needs
to be converted, and why should we not prostrate ourselves at the throne of
grace, as representatives of the church, and from a broken heart and contrite
spirit make earnest supplication that the Holy Spirit shall be poured out upon
us from ón high?"—Testimonies to Ministers, page 64.
    11. What will be the result of the repentance and reformation
on the part of the ministers and lay members? What two outpour-
ings of the Spirit are mentioned? Joel 2:18, 21-23.
    NOTE.—The marginal reading indicates that the former rain is the result of
a message which prepares the church for the greater showers of the latter rain
which will be "more abundant." "We may be sure that when the Holy Spirit
is poured out those who did not receive and appreciate the early rain will not
see or understand the value of the latter rain."—Testimonies to Ministers, page
399.
    "The latter rain, ripening earth's harvest, represents the spiritual grace that
prepares the church for the coming of the Son of man. But unless the former
rain has fallen, there will be no life; the green blade will not spring up. Unless
the early showers have done their work, the latter rain can bring no seed to
perfection. . . . Many have in a great measure failed to receive the former
rain. They have not obtained all the benefits that God has thus provided for
them. They expect that the lack will be supplied by the latter rain. . . . Unless
we are daily advancing in the exemplification of the active Christian virtues,
we shall not recognize the manifestations of the Holy Spirit in the latter rain.
It may be falling on hearts all around us, but we shall not discern or receive it."
—Ibid., pages 506,507.
   12. What rich harvest is pictured as the result °of these spiritual
showers? What will God's people then know, indicating that the
World can no longer say, "Where is their God?" Joel 2:24-27.
                              The Latter Rain
    13. After the Lord returns to Zion in response to the prayers
and reformations of His people, how will His work in all the earth
be finished? What complete deliverance from sin is promised the
"remnant"? Joel 2:28-32.
    NOTE. "Why has the history of the work of the disciples, as they labored
with holy zeal, animated and vitalized by the Holy Spirit, been recorded, if it
is.not that from this record the Lord's people today are to gain an inspiration
to work earnestly for Him? What the Lord did for His people in that time, it
is just as essential, and more so, that He do for His people today. All that the
apostles did, every church member today is to do. And we are to work with as
much more fervor, to be accompanied by the Holy Spirit in as much greater
                                     -[38 ] -
measure, as the increase of wickedness demands a more decided call to repent-
ance. . . . Should not the power of God be even more mightily revealed today
than in the time of the apostles?"—Testimonies, vol. 7, p. 33.
    14. How is the preparation for the latter rain described by
another prophet? What is the rain of spiritual power said to be?
Hosea 10:12.
    NOTE.—"Let us, with contrite hearts, pray most earnestly that now, in the
time of the latter rain, the showers of grace may fall upon us. At every meet-
ing we attend our prayers should ascend, that at this very time God will impart
warmth and moisture to our souls. As we seek God for the Holy Spirit, it will
work in us meekness, humbleness of mind, a conscious dependence upon God
for the perfecting latter rain. If we pray for the blessing in faith, we shall re-
ceive it as God has promised."—Testimonies to Ministers, page 509.
     15. How is the closing work of the gospel under the "loud cry"
and latter rain described by the revelator? What final call will be
made to God's people still in Babylon? Rev. 18:1-5.
     NOTE.—"Notwithstanding the spiritual darkness and alienation from God
that exist in the churches which constitute Babylon, the great body of Christ's
true followers are still to be found in their communion. . . . Revelation 18
points to the time when, as the result of rejecting the threefold warning of
Revelation 14:6-12, the church will have fully reached the condition foretold
by the second angel, and the people of God still in Babylon will be called
upon to separate from her communion."—The Great Controversy, page 390.
     16. What shows that righteousness will be fully developed in
those who are reaped and garnered by the Lord of the harvest?
What other harvest is fully matured in wickedness when Christ
returns? Rev. 14:14-19.
     NOTE.—As the same showers ripen both the wheat and the tares so that the
 difference is distinguishable, so the same Holy Spirit visitation develops to full
 maturity, righteousness in one class and wickedness in the other. Both are
"fully ripe" when the sickles reap them, one for the garner of God and the
 other for the wine press of the wrath of God. The sickles are "sharp" so that
 they cut clean and leave no gleanings. "The harvest is the end of the world"
 and "the end of probationary time."

              THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
         March 27, 1948—Southern European Division
    Czechoslovakia, experiencing a mighty "latter-day reformation," is the
appealing objective of the "overflow" offering. Two urgent needs call for our
most liberal consideration. The first, and perhaps the greatest and most need-
ful, is for a training school. There is no school where a, veritable army of young
men and women can be trained as "good soldiers" of Christ. Czechoslovakia
has 4,000 church members in its 103 churches, with many young people. Youth's
congresses have had an attendance of more than two thousand. The govern-
ment has now authorized a training school project, and twenty acres of land
have been secured near Prague. The Southern European Division look to the
Sabbath schools of the world for a generous Thirteenth Sabbath Offering.
    A small, but properly equipped publishing house is the second great need.
At present, publishing work is cramped into four small rooms. A modest pub-
lishing house is to be erected on the land where the school is to be established,
from which center will radiate the living message by voice and pen. The second
quarter of 1946 our Sabbath schools gave $30,731.36 to Southern Europe for a
sanitarium in France. Surely our liberal-spirited membership will respond
again with an even larger offering for this twofold need!
