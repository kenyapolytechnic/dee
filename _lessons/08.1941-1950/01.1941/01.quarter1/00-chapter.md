        THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES—II
  (From the Ministry of Saul and Peter to the End of Paul's
               Second Missionary Journey)


                      Lesson 1, for January 4, 1941
        Saul Leaves Damascus; Peter's Ministry
    SCRIPTURE: Acts 9:23-43?
    MEMORY VERSE: "He which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the
faith which once he destroyed." Gal. 1:23.
    STUDY HELP: "The Acts of the Apostles," pages 123-132.
    PLACES: Damascus; Jerusalem; Caesarea; Tarsus; Lydda; Joppa; and the chief
divisions of Palestine.
    PERSONS: Saul; Barnabas; enemy Jews; disciples; Peter; Aeneas; Dorcas;
messengers; Simon a tanner.

                            Setting of the Lesson
      "After that many days were fulfilled," introduces an experience in Saul's
life that is not mentioned in the Acts. The period "many days" evidently refers
 to the time, about three years, which Saul spent in Arabia after his conversion.
 When opposition to his work in Damascus became very bitter, "a messenger
 from heaven bade him leave for a time; and he 'went into Arabia,' [Gal. 1:17]
where he found a safe retreat. Here, in the solitude of the desert, Paul [Saul]
had ample opportunity for quiet study and meditation. He calmly reviewed
his past experience, and made sure work of repentance. He sought God with all
his heart, resting not until he knew for a certainty that his repentance was ac-
cepted and his sin pardoned. He longed for the assurance that Jesus would be
with him in his coming ministry. He emptied his soul of the prejudices and
traditions that had hitherto shaped his life, and received instruction from the
Source of truth. Jesus communed with him, and established him in the faith,
bestowing upon him a rich measure of wisdom and grace."—The Acts of the
Apostles, pages 125, 126.
     "From Arabia Paul 'returned again unto Damascus,' and 'preached boldly
. . . in the name of Jesus.' Unable to withstand the wisdom of his arguments,
'the Jews took counsel to kill him.' "—Id., page 128..
                      Saul Escapes From Damascus
    1. On Saul's returning to Damascus, what did the opposing Jews seek to
do? Acts 9:23.
    2. How persistent were the enemies of Saul in their plans for his destruc-
tion? Verse 24.

         WE MUST, tIKE PAUL.
           SPEAK
          "BOLDLY



    NOTE.—In 2 Corinthians 11:32 Paul states that the governor of Damascus
kept the city with a garrison of soldiers, and desired to arrest him. It seems
strange that it should take so many soldiers to hunt down one humble Chris-
tian; but Saul had Jesus and all the angels on his side, and escaped the trap
laid for him.
    3. To what means did the disciples resort to rescue Saul from his
enemies? Acts 9:25.
    NoTE.—"From an unguarded part of the wall, in the darkness of the night,
probably where some overhanging houses, as is usual in Eastern cities, opened
upon the outer country, they let him down from the window in a basket."—
Life and Epistles of the Apostle Paul, Conybeare and Howson, page 100.
           Saul Unites With the Brethren in Jerusalem
    4. To what city did Saul go?, With whom did he seek to unite in Jeru-
salem? Why did he not succeed? Verse 26.
    NoTE.—"It was difficult for them [the disciples] to believe that so bigoted
a Pharisee, and one who had done so much to destroy the church, could be-
come a sincere follower of Jesus."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 129.
    5. How were the disciples at Jerusalem assured of the genuineness of
Saul's conversion? Verses 27, 28.
    NoTE.—"Peter and James, who at that time were the only apostles in Je-
rusalem, gave the right hand of fellowship to the once fierce persecutor of their
faith; and he was now as much beloved and respected as he had formerly been
feared and avoided. Here the two grand characters of the new faith met—

Peter, one of the chosen companions of Christ while He was upon earth, and
Paul, a Pharisee, who, since the ascension of Jesus, had met Him face to face,
and had talked with Him."—The Spirit of Prophecy, vol. 3, page 321.
     6. What further evidence did Paul give of the change that had taken
place in him since he had lived in Jerusalem? What danger again threatened
him? Verse 29.
    7. How deep was Saul's love for those who were seeking his life? Rom.
9:1-3.
    NOTE.—"Sorrow filled his [Saul's] heart. He would willingly have yielded
up his life, if by that means he might bring some to a knowledge of the truth.
With shame he thought of the active part he had taken in the martyrdom of
Stephen; and now in his anxiety to wipe out the stain resting upon one so
falsely accused, he sought to vindicate the truth for which Stephen had given
his life."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 129.
    8. How was Saul delivered from the further plottings of his enemies?
Acts 9:30.
    NorE.—Tarsus was Saul's birthplace. It was located at the northeast corner
of the Mediterranean Sea, and he once referred to it as "no mean city." Acts
21:39. Sir William Mitchell Ramsay, a learned writer, says that it is now
"a wretched town of the Turkish style, retaining not a trace of its former
splendor."
    9. What was the experience of the churches at this time? Acts 9:31.
    NorE.—The churches did not rest from witnessing for Jesus, but they had
rest from persecution; the members could labor freely, and their numbers
multiplied.
                      Peter at Lydda and Joppa
    10. During Peter's preaching tour, to what city did he come? What
afflicted man did he find there?. Verses 32, 33.
    11. In what manner was the sick man healed? What was the effect of
Peter's work at Lydda? Verses 34, 35.
    12. What city is next mentioned? What is said of one disciple who
lived there? Verses 36, 37.
    NorE.—Lydda, in the rich plain of Sharon, was a city of considerable size,
about twenty-five miles from Jerusalem. Joppa was nine or ten miles north of
Lydda.
    13. What message was sent Peter at Lydda? Verse 38.
    14. What scene greeted Peter at the home of Dorcas? Verse 39.
    15. What further manifestation of power attended Peter's ministry at
Joppa? With what result? Verses 40-42.
    16. As Peter remained there for a time, with whom did he stay? Verse
43.

                   Lesson 2, for January 11, 1941
        Cornelius, the Gentile; Peter, the Jew
   SCRIPTURE: Acts 10:1-23.
   MEMORY VERSE: "Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial be-
fore God." Acts 10:4.
   STUDY HELPS: "The Acts of the Apostles," pages 132-137; "The Ministry of
Healing," pages 209-216.
   PLACES: Caesarea; home of Simon in Joppa.
   PERSONS: Cornelius and his household; angel messenger; Simon the tanner;
Simon Peter and six brethren from Joppa.

                          Setting of the Lesson
    Caesarea, on the shore of the Mediterranean, was about thirty miles north
of Joppa. It was a Gentile city, and the political capital of Judea. Joppa, now
called Jaffa, is still an important town in Palestine. To understand all the
circumstances of this lesson, one must remember the deep-seated feelings of the
Jew against the Gentile. No pious Jew would go to the home of a Gentile, or
enter into any social relationship with one of them. One of the great questions
the early church had to settle was the admission of the Gentiles to the privileges
of the gospel.
                         God Calls a Centurion
      1. What person of note is introduced in the first verse of this lesson?
Acts 10:1.
     NOTE.—A centurion in Roman armies was somewhat similar in rank to a
captain in modern armies. Cornelius "was a man of wealth and noble birth,
and his position was one of trust and honor. A heathen by birth, training, and
education, through contact with the Jews he had gained a knowledge of God.
. . . Though Cornelius believed the prophecies, and was looking for the Mes-
siah to come, he had not a knowledge of the gospel as revealed in the life and
death of Christ."—The Acts of the Apostles, pages 132, 133.
      2. What four things are said of Cornelius? Verse 2.
      3. What experience did Cornelius have one afternoon at the ninth hour
 (the hour of prayer)? Verse 3.
    4. How was Cornelius affected by the vision of the angel? What ques-
tion did he ask? What did the angel say was remembered in heaven?
Verse 4.
    5. To whom did the angel direct Cornelius for further light and instruc-
tion? How explicit were the directions given? verses 5, 6.
    No-I-E.—The first six verses of this chapter reveal the intimate knowledge
that Heaven has of the names, abode, occupation, and heart longings of men.
Here in the case of the Roman officer in the chief Roman city of Palestine, and
of the humble tanner in Joppa, the Lord took knowledge of all their circum-
stances, and gave specific directions to each, even to the location of Simon's
house. Truly "the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous," and "the Lord
knoweth them that are His."
    6. How did Cornelius respond to the instruction of the angel? Verses
7, 8.
                                 [5I
                  Peter in Vision in Simon's House
   7. When did the servants reach Joppa? What was Peter doing at that
time? Verse 9,
   NorE.—"The sixth hour [noon] was a set time of devotion with pious
Jews."—Cunningham Geikie.
    8. What experience did Peter have while dinner was being prepared?
Verse 10.
    9. What did Peter see while in the trance? What words did he hear?
How did he reply? Verses 11-14.
    10. What did the voice then say? How many times was this message
spoken? Verses 15, 16.
    11. What was Peter's state of mind as to the meaning of the vision?
What visitors were even then at the gate? For whom did they make inquiry?
Verses 17, 18.
    NOTE.—"This vision conveyed to Peter both reproof and instruction. It
revealed to him the purpose of God,—that by the death of Christ the Gentiles
should be made fellow heirs with the Jews to the blessings of salvation. As yet
none of the disciples had preached the gospel to the Gentiles. In their minds,
the middle wall of partition, broken down by the death of Christ, still existed,
and their labors had been confined to the Jews; for they had looked upon the
Gentiles as excluded from the blessings of the gospel. Now the Lord was seek-
ing to teach Peter the world-wide extent of the divine plan. Many of the
Gentiles had been interested listeners to the preaching of Peter and the other
apostles, and many of the Greek Jews had become believers in Christ, but the
conversion of Cornelius was to be the first of importance among the Gentiles."
—The Acts of the Apostles, pages 135, 136.
   "Some have urged that this vision was to signify that God had removed His
prohibition from the use of the flesh of animals which He had formerly pro-
nounced unclean; and that therefore swines' flesh was fit for food. This is a
very narrow, and altogether erroneous, interpretation, and is plainly contra-
dicted in the scriptural account of the vision and its consequences."—The Spirit
of Prophecy, vol. 3, pp. 327, 328.
                         Three Men Seek Peter
    12. What further instruction did Peter receive while still reflecting on
the vision? Verses 19, 20.
   '13, What did Peter then do? What question did he ask? How did the
messengers present the request from Cornelius? Verses 21, 22.
    14. What Christian hospitality did Peter then extend to these Gentile
men? Verse 23.
                        Think on These Things
   How the Lord's plans always fit.
   How might His plan, revealed in this lesson, have been spoiled?
             "Say not, 'I love the Lord,' unless you find
              Within you, welling up by day and night
              A love, strong, full, and deep, for all mankind."

                   Lesson 3, for January 18, 1941
        Cornelius, the Gentile; Peter, the Jew
                     (Concluded)
   SCRIPTURE: Acts 10:24-48.
   MEMORY VERSE: "In every nation he that feareth Him, and worketh righteous-
ness, is accepted with Him." Acts 10:35.
   STUDY HELP: "The Acts of the Apostles," pages 137-142.
   PLACE: Home of Cornelius in Caesarea.
   PERSONS: Cornelius, his household, friends, relatives; Peter, and six men from
Joppa.

                          Setting of the Lesson
   In response to the earnest entreaty of the messengers from Cornelius, and
the direction of the Holy Spirit, Peter had left Joppa and journeyed to
Caesarea. Six Jewish brethren from Joppa accompanied him. Cornelius had
gathered his relatives and friends at his house, and when Peter arrived all were
eagerly waiting to listen to his message.
                        In the Centurion's Home
   1. When did Peter and those who were with him arrive in Caesarea?
What preparation had Cornelius made in view of Peter's expected arrival?
Acts 10:24.
                                      [
    NoTE.—Peter and Cornelius were both chosen of God to lead out in the
giving of the gospel to the Gentiles. Peter was a Jew by birth and training,
thoroughly possessed by the strongest of prejudices against all men "of another
nation." Before the "middle wall of partition" could be broken down racially
between the Jews and Gentiles, it must be broken down in Peter himself, God's
chosen vessel to bear the gospel first beyond the bounds of Judaism. Acts 15:7.
The journey to Caesarea and the experience at the house of Cornelius were to
help Peter as much as Cornelius and his friends.
    2. How did Cornelius receive Peter? How did Peter respond to the
homage paid to him by Cornelius? Acts 10f25, 26.
    NOTE.—"As Peter entered the house of the Gentile, Cornelius did not salute
him as an ordinary visitor, but as one honored of Heaven, and sent to him by
God. It is an Eastern custom to bow before a prince or other high dignitary,
and for children to bow before their parents; but Cornelius, overwhelmed with
reverence for the one sent by God to teach him, fell at the apostle's feet, and
worshiped him. Peter was horror-stricken, and he lifted the centurion up, say-
ifig, 'Stand up; I myself also am a man.' "—The Acts of the Apostles, page 137.
     3. How did Peter explain his coming to the home of a Gentile? What
question did he ask? Verses 27-29.
     NoTE.—The presence of Peter in the house of Cornelius marks a new era in
the spread of the gospel. Jesus had said to the disciples before His ascension
that they should be witnesses unto Him "in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in
Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth." Witness had been borne
in the first three places named, and now the fourth move is about to be made.
It is true Saul had preached in Damascus of Syria already, and was now doing
likewise in Cilicia; but Saul had preached to the Jews largely, and so had Peter
and others until this hour. See Acts 11:19. Peter is now about to preach the
first Christian sermon to a Gentile audience, the beginning of a distinctive
world-wide movement. What wonder that he felt it expedient to take six
Jewish brethren with him for witnesses!
     4. In reply, how did Cornelius explain why he had sent for Peter? Acts
10:30-33.
     5. As Peter listened to the experience of Cornelius, what clear vision
of a truth was given him? What did he say of the people in every nation?
Verses 34, 35.
                 Peter Presents the Gospel Message
    6. Whom did Peter then preach? Where did he say the gospel of Jesus
had been preached? What mention did he make of John the Baptist?
Verses 36, 37.
    NOTE.—"Then to that company of attentive hearers the apostle preached
Christ,—His life, His miracles, His betrayal and crucifixion, His resurrection
and ascension, and His work in heaven as man's representative and advocate.
As Peter pointed those present to Jesus as the sinner's only hope, he himself
understood more fully the meaning of the vision he had seen, and his heart
glowed with the spirit of the truth that he was presenting."—The Acts of the
Apostles, pages 138, 139.
    7. With what had Jesus been anointed? What did He do while on earth?
Who was with Him? Verse 38.
    8. Who were witnesses of all that He did? What did Peter say further
of Jesus? Verses 39, 40.
                                     [8)
    9. What proof of His resurrection had been given to Peter and other
witnesses? Verse 41.
    10. To what great truth were Peter and other witnesses commanded to
testify? Verse 42.
    11. What similar witness had been borne, and by whom? Verse 43.
             The Assembly Honored With God's Spirit
   12. What came to pass while Peter was preaching? Verse 44.
   13. How were those who came with Peter affected by this? What did
they hear? Verses 45, 46.
   14. What question did Peter boldly ask? What command did he then
give? What did the believers in Caesarea ask Peter to do? Verses 47, 48.
                         Think on These Things
   Christian courtesy between races or classes.
   God recognizes no racial barriers in the pouring out of His Holy Spirit.



                    Lesson 4, for January 25, 1941
    Peter Rehearses His Experience; The Gospel
                 Reaches Antioch
    SCRIPTURE: Acts 11.
    MEMORY VERSE: "The hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number
believed, and turned unto the Lord." Acts 11:21.
   STUDY HELP: "The Acts of the Apostles," pages 141, 142, 155-159.
    PLACES: Jerusalem; Joppa; Antioch; Phenice; Cyprus; Cyrene; Tarsus; Judea.
    PERSONS: Peter and six Jewish brethren; faultfinders at Jerusalem; scattered
believerS; Grecians; Barnabas; Saul; Agabus and other prophets from Jerusalem;
Claudius Caesar.
                           Setting of the Lesson
    A stir among the believers in Judea. Strange reports had reached their ears
concerning the conduct of Peter. They had heard that he had actually been
preaching the gospel to Gentiles. The prejudice of the Jewish believers against
the idea of Gentile participation in the gospel led them to contend with Peter,
and afforded occasion for him to rehearse his experiences in detail, when he
returned to Jerusalem.
    Some years had passed since Pentecost, and the preaching of Jesus as a
crucified and risen Saviour had been going on steadily ever since. But hereto-
fore He had been made to appear not as the Saviour of mankind, but rather
as the son of a Jew, and the Saviour of the Jews. Now the experience at
Caesarea, and the acceptance of it by the church at Jerusalem, gives a new
meaning to the preaching of the Lord Jesus, and the apostles enter upon a new
stage of carrying the gospel "into all the world," "for a witness unto all nations."
    The center of activity in spreading the gospel shifts in this lesson from Jeru-
salem to Antioch, capital of Syria. This was an important city commercially,
"the common mart where East and West met," sixteen miles from the Mediter-
ranean Sea and about three hundred miles north of Jerusalem.
                                       [9 }
                    Peter Reports God's Leadings
   1. What report was brought to the brethren in Judea concerning the
work of Peter in the home of Cornelius, a Gentile? Acts 11:1.
   2. When Peter came to Jerusalem, what fault was found with him?
Verses 2, 3.   .
   3. In defense, what did Peter rehearse? Verses 4-14.
   4. What divine power did Peter tell them accompanied his sermon
preached in the house of Cornelius? Verse 15.
   5. What words of Jesus did Peter then remember? Verse 16.
   6. What appeal did he then make to his brethren? Verse 17.
                    The Church Accepts and Rejoices
    7. How did the believers in Jerusalem show that they were convinced of
the truth of Peter's conclusion? Verse 18.
    NOTE.—"On hearing this account, the brethren were silenced. Convinced
that Peter's course was in direct fulfillment of the plan of God, and that their
prejudices and exclusiveness were utterly contrary to the spirit of the gospel,
they glorified God. . . . Thus, without controversy, prejudice was broken
down, the exclusiveness established by the custom of ages was abandoned, and
the way was opened for the gospel to be proclaimed to the Gentiles."—The Acts
of the Apostles, page 142.
    8. When Jesus first sent out the disciples, where were they commanded
to go? Where were they not to go? Matt. 10:5, 6.
    NOTE.—In Daniel's prophecy (Dan. 9:24), 70 weeks, or 490 years, were
allotted to the Jews. This period began in the autumn of 457 B. c., and ter-
minated in the autumn of 34 A. D. The gospel call was, therefore, in God's own
plan limited to the Jews until that date. Paul and Barnabas, speaking to the
Jews, said, "It was necessary that the word of God should first have been
spoken to you." In that very year, 34 A. 0., occurred the great persecution in
which Stephen, the first Christian martyr, was put to death. Stephen's murder
by the Jewish Sanhedrin marked the formal rejection of the gospel.
    9. Following the death of Stephen, what marked change took place in
the gospel program? Acts 8:4, 5.
    10. When the church was thus scattered abroad, to whom did they at
first confine their preaching? What other group heard the gospel in An-
tioch? Acts 11:19-21.
    NorE.—"Hand of the Lord." "The hand is a symbol of power and of work.
Willing Christians are God's hands. Through them God can easily accomplish
what would be impossible by their unaided efforts. Here were a little group of
refugees, poor, despised, pursued. Here was one of the world's proudest,
mightiest, richest, wickedest cities."—Peloubet's Select Notes. Yet God wrought
such a work that this very city became the center of missionary work for all
the known world at that time.
              Barnabas and Paul Become Colaborers
    11. Whom did the church at Jerusalem send to build up the work in
this newly opened center of light? How did Barnabas exhort the new con-
verts? Verses 22, 23.
                                   {10)
    12. What character is ascribed to Barnabas? Whom did he seek as a
colaborer? Verses 24, 25.
   NOTE.—It is quite probable that the work among the Gentiles at Caesarea,
and among the Grecians at Antioch, reminded Barnabas of what the Lord had
declared concerning Saul, "He is a chosen vessel unto Me, to bear My name
before the Gentiles." Acts 9:15.
    13. For how long a time did Barnabas and Saul labor together at Anti-
och? What new name was given to the believers there? Acts 11:26.
   NOTE.—"It was God who gave to them the name of Christian. This is a
royal name, given to all who join themselves to Christ."—The Acts of the
Apostles, page 157.
    14. Who came to Antioch from Jerusalem at that time? What was the
name of one of the prophets? What did he prophesy? What noted event
took place in fulfillment of the prophecy? Verses 27, 28.
    15. What did Christians in Antioch do to relieve the great need in
Judea? Verses 29, 30.
   NOTE.—The believers in Antioch were not rich, but the Christians in Jeru-
salem, oppressed by persecution, were poorer than they. They gave "every
man according to his ability," which is still the test of duty. By this gift the
givers were blessed, for all giving enriches the one who gives. This act would
also serve to knit more closely the two nationalities, Jew and Gentile. The
need for unselfish giving was never greater than today. In verse 30, the first
mention is made of "elders" in the New Testament.

   He makes character the test.
   Things that seem to hinder the work may be really advancing it.
   Giving enriches the giver.


                     Lesson 5, for February 1, 1941
  Death of James; Peter Delivered From Prison
   SCRIPTURE: Acts 12.
    MEMORY VERSE: "We may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not
fear what man shall do unto me." Heb. 13:6.
   STUDY HELPS: "The Acts of the Apostles," pages 143-154; "Testimonies,"
vol. 5, pp. 748, 749.
     PLACES: The famous prison, the fortress of Antonia in Jerusalem; city streets
through which Peter passed; the home of Mary, the mother of Mark.
    PERSONS: King Herod, grandson of Herod the Great; James, the brother of John,
both apostles; Peter, an apostle; soldier guards; the angel of the Lord; a damsel named
Rhoda, a maid in the household of Mary; John Mark; keepers of the prison; Blastus,
the king's chamberlain, an officer high in the king's confidence; Barnabas and Saul.
                            Setting of the Lesson
   For a time the churches in Judea, Galilee, and Samaria had enjoyed freedom
from persecution. Acts 9:31. The Jews again turned against the rapidly in-
creasing Christian church and used their influence with the king to stop its
                                     [11 ]
progress by persecution. Barnabas and Saul came to Jerusalem, bringing the
relief that had been provided by the church at Antioch.
                  Persecution Renewed at Jerusalem
     1. What Christian believer became the first victim of the renewed efforts
 to persecute the followers of Jesus? Acts 12:1, 2.
     NoTE.—James, the brother of John, had been a prominent apostle. He was
 one of the favored three admitted to the death chamber of Jairus's daughter
 (Mark 5:37), and to the mount of transfiguration (Matt. 17:1). He also had
 witnessed the agony of Jesus in Gethsemane (Matt. 26:37).
     2. What seems to have been the chief motive prompting Herod in this
 cruel persecution? Verse 3.
    NOTE.—The Passover season was called "the days of unleavened bread."
The Jews would have been offended if Herod had shed the blood of Peter
 during that festival, and he therefore put him in prison till after the Passover.
Four modes of execution were lawful among the Jews—stoning, beheading,
burning, and strangling.
    Several Herods are mentioned in New Testament history.
    a. Herod the Great, the founder of the family, was the murderer of the
children in his efforts to put the infant Jesus to death. Matt. 2:16.
    b. Herod Antipas, his son, was the Herod who put John the Baptist to
death.
    c. Herod Agrippa I, grandson of Herod the Great, was the king who killed
the apostle James with the sword, as recorded in this lesson. Acts 12:2.
    d. Herod Agrippa II, great grandson of Herod the Great, was the Herod
who, with his sister Bernice, later heard Paul make his noted defense. Acts
26:1,2.
    The name Herod is said to mean "herolike." What a travesty upon the
name this line of Herods proved to be !
    3. What did Herod purpose concerning Peter? Verse 4.
    NOTE.—"Remembering the former escape of the apostles from prison,
Herod on this occasion had taken double precautions. To prevent all possibility
of release, Peter had been put under the charge of sixteen soldiers, who, in dif-
ferent watches, guarded him day and night. In his cell, he was placed between
two soldiers, and was bound by two chains, each chain being fastened to the
wrist of one of the soldiers. He was unable to move without their knowledge.
With the prison doors securely fastened, and a strong guard before them, all
chance of rescue or escape through human means was cut off ."—The Acts of
the Apostles, pages 145, 146.

              Peter in Prison—The Church Seeks God
    4. While Peter was in prison, how did the church remember him?
Verse 5.
    5. How was the prisoner guarded the night before he was to be put to
death? What evidence is given which shows that Peter was not worrying?
Verse 6.
    NOTE.—"Peter was confined in a rock-hewn cell, the doors of which were
strongly bolted and barred; and the soldiers on guard were made answerable
for the safekeeping of the prisoner. But the bolts and bars and the Roman

more complete the triumph of God in the deliverance of Peter."—The Acts of
the Apostles, page 146.
                         An Angel Delivers Peter
    6. Who visited the prison that night? How was Peter awakened? What
command showed that the heavenly visitor had regard for Peter's comfort?
Verses 7, 8.
    NorE.—"It is the last night before the proposed execution. A mighty angel
is sent from heaven to rescue Peter. The strong gates that shut in the saint of
God open without the aid of human hands. The angel of the Most High passes
through, and the gates close noiselessly behind him. He enters the cell, and
there lies Peter, sleeping the peaceful sleep of perfect trust.
    "The light that surrounds the angel fills the cell, but does not rouse the
apostle. Not until he feels the touch of the angel's hand, and hears a voice
saying, 'Arise up quickly,' does he awaken sufficiently to see his cell illuminated
by the light of heaven, and an angel of great glory standing before him.
Mechanically he obeys the word spoken to him, and as in rising he lifts his
hands, he is dimly conscious that the chains have fallen from his wrists."—The
Acts of the Apostles, pages 146, 147.
    7. How did this sudden awakening out of sleep and that which followed
impress Peter? How was he enabled to pass through the prison gates?
Verses 9, 10.
    8. After the angel had departed, what did the apostle say to himself?
Where did he go? Verses 11, 12.
                                     1131
     NOTE.—Peter "now realized that he was free, in a familiar part of the city.
. . . The apostle made his way at once to the house where his brethren were
assembled, and where they were at that moment engaged in earnest prayer for
him."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 148.
     9. What was Peter's experience in gaining admission to the house of his
friend? What did he tell those assembled there? Verses 13-17.
     NOTE.—How was Peter received? No doubt he was welcomed with such an
outburst of exclamation and questions that he could only raise his hand in
admonition to be silent while he told the story of his deliverance and sent the
message to the other James, one of the leaders of the church in Jerusalem,
and to the brethren. He then sought safety elsewhere.
     10. What took place in the morning? What very unreasonable command
did Herod give concerning the soldier guard? To what place did he then go
for a time? Verses 18, 19.
     NOTE.—"Herod knew that no human power had rescued Peter, but he was
determined not to acknowledge that a divine power had frustrated his design,
and he set himself in bold defiance against God."—The Acts of the Apostles,
page 149.
                       The Persecutor Stricken
    11. How was a quarrel settled between Herod and the people of Tyre
and Sidon? Verse 20. •
    12. What took place upon a special day? Verses 21-23.
    NOTE.—"Herod knew that he deserved none of the praise and homage of-
fered him, yet he accepted the idolatry of the people as his due. . . . But
suddenly a terrible change came over him. His face became pallid as death, and
distorted with agony. Great drops of sweat started from his pores. He stood
for a moment as if transfixed with pain and terror; then turning his blanched
and livid face to his horror-stricken friends, he cried in hollow, despairing
tones, He whom you have exalted as a god is stricken with death. Suffering
the most excruciating anguish, he was borne from the scene of revelry and dis-
play."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 151.
    "The same angel who had come from the royal courts to rescue Peter, had
been the messenger of wrath and judgment to Herod."—Id., page 152.
    13. How was the work of the gospel affected by the persecution at the
hand of Herod and by the deliverance of Peter? What mission had been ful-
filled by Barnabas and Saul during the time of the events recorded in this
lesson? Verses 24, 25.
    NOTE.—These brethren had come to Jerusalem to bring the help provided
by the church at Antioch. The famine was on the increase. History tells us it
began in 43 A. D., and continued until 45 A. D.

                    Lesson 6, for February 8, 1941
   Beginning of Paul's First Missionary Journey
    SCRIPTURE: Acts 13:1-15.
    MEMORY VERSE: "The Lord knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way
of the ungodly shall perish." Ps. 1 :6.
    STUDY HELP: "The Acts of the Apostles," pages 160-171.
    PLACES: Antioch in Syria; Seleucia; Salamis and Paphos on the island of
Cyprus; Perga in Pamphylia; Antioch in Pisidia.
    PERSONS: Saul, hereafter called Paul; Barnabas, Simeon, called Niger, Lucius of
Cyrene, and Manaen, prophets and teachers at Antioch; John Mark, a worker with the
apostles; Jews and Gentiles.

                         Setting of the Lesson
    When Saul was converted, the Lord said, "He is a chosen vessel unto Me,
to bear My name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel."
Acts 9:15. Paul waited, working as he had opportunity, until the Lord Himself
opened the way for a larger work. He labored with Barnabas at Antioch, in
Syria, about one year, but neither of them had been formally ordained to the
gospel ministry. This first missionary journey seems to have required about
one thousand miles of traveling.
                     Paul and Barnabas Set Apart
      1. Name some of the prophets and teachers in the church at Antioch.
  While these devout men were seeking the Lord, what message came to them
  from the Holy Spirit? Acts 13:1, 2.
      NOTE.—It is worthy of note that Manaen was brought up with Herod
  (Antipas) the tetrarch. Barnes says that Herod's father doubtless educated
 Manaen with his own son, they being about the same age. Manaen, therefore,
  must have been a man of rank in Israel. The gospel was not confined entirely
  in its influence to the poor, but had reached the influential classes in Israel.
      2. What three things were done by those who followed the instruction to
' "separate" Barnabas and Saul for this special work? Verse 3.
      NOTE.—"Paul regarded the occasion of his formal ordination as marking
  the beginning of a new and important epoch in his lifework. It was from this
  time that he afterward dated the beginning of his apostleship in the Christian
  church."—The Acts of the Apostles, pages 164, 165.
      3. Who really sent these consecrated workers on their mission? Where
  did they first go? Verse 4.
      NoTE.—Why did they first go to Cyprus? Some of the probable reasons
 are thus listed:
      "Because Barnabas was a native of that island and would have an opening
  there among relatives and acquaintances.
      "Because Paul was a native of Tarsus, in Cilicia, not far away, and may
  have known Cyprus people.
      "Because some of the disciples driven from Jerusalem by persecution had
  preached the gospel in Cyprus (Acts 11:19), and some of these had been to
  Antioch, and doubtless knew Paul and Barnabas.
      "Because the inhabitants were generally Greeks, but many Jews had settled
  there, attracted by rich copper mines. Copper (Greek, cypros) derived its
  name from the island."—Peloubet's Select Notes, abbreviated and adapted.

Fl R ST STAGE


                Paul's First Missionary Journey
                The Beginning of the First Journey
    4. At what place did they begin preaching? Who was with them as a
helper? Verse 5.
    NoTE.—Salamis was a maritime city on the east coast of Cyprus. Jewish
residents were evidently numerous, sustaining more than one synagogue.
    John, the helper, is John Mark, or Marcus, the writer of one of the four
Gospels. From Colossians 4:10 we learn that he was related to Barnabas. It
is quite possible that he relates his own experience in Mark 14:51, 52.
    5. To what city did they come after passing through the island? Whom
did they find there? Acts 13:6.
    6. With what prominent man was this sorcerer connected? What did
the deputy desire to hear? Why did Elymas oppose the work of the apos-
tles? Verses 7, 8.
    NOTE.—Sorcerers, magicians, and false prophets abounded in the East. There
was scarcely a Roman family that did not keep or consult its favorite foreteller
of the future. Elymas realized that if the Roman official gave heed to the mes-
sage of Paul and Barnabas, his own occupation and support would cease,
therefore he opposed them with all his power.
    7. What name is henceforth given to Saul? Verse 9. '

                         The Sorcerer Punished
   8. Filled with the Holy Spirit, what did Paul say to Elymas? Of what
was he an enemy? Verse 10.
    9. What punishment from the Lord did Paul say should come upon him?
Verse 11.
    NOTE.—"The sorcerer had closed his eyes to the evidences of gospel truth;
and the Lord, in righteous anger, caused his natural eyes to be closed, shutting
out from him the light of day. This blindness was not permanent, but only for
a season, that he might be warned to repent, and seek pardon of the God whom
he had so grievously offended. The confusion into which he was thus brought,
made of no effect his subtle arts against the doctrine of Christ. The fact that
he was obliged to grope about in blindness, proved to all that the miracles
which the apostles had performed, and which Elymas had denounced as sleight
of hand, were wrought by the power of God."—The Acts of the Apostles,
page 168.
    10. How was the deputy affected by the experience of Elymas? Verse 12.

                    In Pamphylia—Mark Departs
   11. To what place did the apostles next go? Verse 13, first part.
    12. At Perga, who left the company? Verse, 13, last part.
    NOTE.—"It was here that [Johnl Mark, overwhelmed with fear and dis-
couragement, wavered for a time in his purpose to give himself wholeheartedly
to the Lord's work. Unused to hardships, he was disheartened by the perils
and privations of the way. He had labored with success under favorable cir-
cumstances; but now, amidst the opposition and perils that so often beset the
pioneer worker, he failed to endure hardness as a good soldier of the cross. He
had yet to learn to face danger and persecution and adversity with a brave
heart. As the apostles advanced, and still greater difficulties were apprehended,
                                     ( 17
Mark was intimidated, and losing all courage, refused to go farther."—The
 Acts of the Apostles, pages 169, 170.
     13. Why need no one fear opposition to the truth of God's word? 2 Cor.
13:8.
    NOTE.—S. D. Gordon makes a statement which is in harmony with the
experience of every missionary since Paul and Barnabas started on their first
missionary tour. He says: "Wherever God goes, Satan goes. Satan always
travels on God's roads; he never makes roads; Satan is not a road builder; he
is always a thief; he always steals God's pathways. Where the missionary goes
with the message of the cross, you will always find the evil one stealing along
behind him, hard on his heels, using the road he made. There would be op-
position, and sometimes the more we pray, the keener the opposition; but in
spite of it the brighter the shining of the sun through the darkening and gather-
ing clouds, and the greater the victory in the midst of the opposition."
    14. Leaving Perga, where did Paul and Barnabas go? What did they do
on the Sabbath? What invitation did the ruler of the synagogue extend?
Acts 13:14, 15.
                            Trace the Journey
   Start at Antioch in Syria, either passing overland, or down the Qrontes
River by boat, to Seleucia, sixteen miles away.
   Thence the route is by boat southwestward to the island of Cyprus, about
eighty miles out in the Mediterranean Sea. Paul and his company landed at
Salamis on the east end of the island, and then worked across, a distance of
about one hundred and ten miles to Paphos, the capital, on the western coast.
They then took passage for Perga in Pamphylia, the province which extended
along the central part of the southern coast now known as Asia Minor. Perga
was several miles from the coast on the River Cestrus, which was then
navigable.
    From Perga the route was north a hundred miles, perhaps more, crossing
the Taurus Mountains to Antioch in Pisidia on the high tableland.

                   Lesson 7, for February 15, 1941
Paul Preaches to the Jews; Then to the Gentiles
    SCRIPTURE: Acts 13:16-52.
    MEMORY VERSE: "When the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified
the word of the Lord." Acts 13:48.
    STUDY HELP: "The Acts of the Apostles," pages 171-176.
    PLACE: Antioch in Pisidia.
    PERSONS: Rulers in the Jewish synagogue; the apostle Paul; Barnabas, Jews and
Gentiles.
                          Setting of the Lesson
   Paul and Barnabas were on their first missionary tour. They had reached
Antioch in Pisidia. John Mark had left them and returned home. The two
apostles went into the Jewish synagogue on the Sabbath and sat down.
                                     [ 18 )
           Paul Preaches in the Synagogue at Antioch
    1. After the opening of the service on the Sabbath in Antioch, Pisidia,
what invitation did the rulers extend to the visitors? Acts 13:15.
    NorE.—The scene is described by Dr. David James Burrell as follows:
"At the further end of the synagogue stood a desk for the reader. Above that
was the women's gallery; their faces could be seen behind the partitions of
lattice work. On the side of the room nearest Jerusalem was the chest for the
sacred scrolls. Seats for the worshipers were arranged according to station,
those for the rabbis being nearest the reader's desk. . . . Among the wor-
shipers on this particular day were two strangers. . . . These two found their
way to the rabbinical seats. The service commenced with a prayer recited by
the reader or 'Angel of the Assembly.' Then the attendant brought from the
ark the sacred scroll, from which was read the scripture for the day. Then they
sang from the Psalter, which was the Hebrew hymnbook. After that the service
was thrown open, according to custom, to such as occupied rabbinical seats."
 . A special invitation was given to the strangers. This invitation Paul at once
accepted. He did not go into the pulpit, nor seat himself according to the
custom of Jewish preachers, but, making with his hand a characteristic gesture
for attention, he spoke standing in his place.
    2. How did Paul tactfully and wisely introduce his discourse? Verses
16-19.
    NOTE.—Paul in the Jewish synagogue, by referring to the early history of
the Jews, wisely avoided prejudice and won their interest. He believed their
scriptures, in no case overthrowing them, but simply showing how they were
fulfilled.
    3. How did Paul refer to the four hundred fifty years following the
forty years' wandering in the wilderness? Verse 20.
    4. What events did he note from the time of the judges to the birth of
the Messiah? Verses 21-23.
   NOTE.—Paul spoke of King David because the promise was that the Mes-
siah should be his descendant. See Isaiah 11. He thus appealed to the hope
dear to the heart of every Jew, for the Jews were looking for the Messiah. He
then told them that Jesus was that promised Son of David.

                   The Messiah That Was to Come
    5. What reference did Paul make to the work of John the Baptist?
Acts 13:24, 25.
    6. What personal appeal did he then make to his hearers? Who did he
say fulfilled the prophecies that were then being read every Sabbath day in
the synagogues? Verses 26, 27.
    7. What salient points in the life of Jesus did Paul set before the con-
gregation? Verses 28-31.
    8. What glad tidings did he declare to the people? Verses 32, 33.
   9. What clear contrast did Paul make between David and the Holy One?
Verses 34-37.
   10. How did Paul preach forgiveness and justification at Antioch?
What solemn warning was given in this discourse? Verses 38-41.
                                   [ 19 I
                          Results of Paul's Sermon
   11. What request did the Gentile hearers now make? What was the
further result of Paul's sermon? Verses 42-44.
   12. What solemn declaration did the apostle make to those Jews who
contradicted and blasphemed? Verses 45-47.
   13. How did the Gentiles respond to the gospel message? Verses 48, 49.
   14. What opposition followed? What instruction did the disciples carry
out? Verses 50-52; Matt. 10:14.
   NorE.—Driven from Antioch, the missionaries traveled about ninety miles
southeastward to Iconium, a large and wealthy city of Asia Minor.
                           Think on These Things
    How we may minister to those in our homes.
    How we may minister to neighbors, friends, strangers.
    How we may minister to those in faraway lands.
    What evidence is proof to others that we are disciples of Christ?

    Paul and Barnabas at Iconium, Lystra, and
                    Derbe
    SCRIPTURE: Acts 14.
    MEMORY VERSE: "Ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God,
which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein." Acts 14:15.
   STUDY HELPS: "The Acts of the Apostles," pages 177-187; "Early Writings,"
page 203.
    PLACES: Iconium, Lystra, and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia; Antioch in Pisidia;
Perga in Pamphylia; Attalia; return journey to Antioch in Syria across the Mediter-
ranean Sea.
   PERSONS: Paul and Barnabas; believing and unbelieving Jews and Gentiles; a
cripple at Lystra; the priest of Jupiter; Jews from Antioch in Pisidia; the church at
Antioch in Syria.
                            Setting of the Lesson
    Paul and Barnabas were on their first missionary journey, having been set
apart especially for this work by the church at Antioch, in Syria. This lesson
relates their experiences at Iconium, Lystra, and Derbe, and the completion of
their trip by the return to Antioch in Syria.

           Souls Won in Iconium—Persecution Develops
    1. When Paul and Barnabas, being driven from Antioch in Pisidia,
reached Iconium, in what courageous way did they begin their work? What
was the result? Acts 14:1.
    Nom—Paul and Barnabas took the Roman military road to the southeast,
and after a journey of ninety miles came to Iconium. Situated at the inter-
section of several important roads, it was a favorable center for the spread of
the gospel.

    2. How were their experiences in other places repeated here? What
did the missionaries continue to do? How did the Lord show His approval
of the work of the apostles? Verses 2, 3.
    3. As the preaching of the gospel continued, what division of opinion
was created? To what height did the persecution reach? To what other
cities did the apostles flee? Verses 4-7.
    NOTE.—"Persecution is God's way of bidding His soldiers march." This
time it drove Paul and Barnabas to Lystra, about eighteen miles southwest of
Iconium, and then to Derbe, twenty miles southeast of Lystra.

                          Experiences at Lystra
    4. Who is specially mentioned at Lystra? What did Paul perceive?
What miracle was wrought by the Holy Spirit? Verses 8-10.
    NOTE.—"At one time, while Paul was telling the people of Christ's work
as a healer of the sick and afflicted, he saw among his hearers a cripple, whose
eyes were fastened on him, and who received and believed his words. Paul's
heart went out in sympathy toward the afflicted man, in whom he discerned
one who 'had faith to be healed.' In the presence of the idolatrous assembly,
Paul commanded the cripple to stand upright on his feet. Heretofore the suf-
ferer had been able to take a sitting posture only; but now, he instantly obeyed
Paul's command, and for the, first time in his life stood on his feet. Strength
came with this effort of faith, and he who had been a cripple 'leaped and
walked.' "—The Acts of the Apostles, page 181.
                                        [21 ]
      5. Beholding this miracle, what did the people say? What names did
they ascribe to Paul and Barnabas? Verses 11, 12.
     NOTE.—"The Egyptians and Greeks believed that the gods often assumed
human bodies, and visited the earth to reward the good and punish the evil.
. . . Jupiter was their chief god, and Mercury was the messenger of the gods.
. . . Mercury is represented as young and active and eloquent; Paul was called
Mercury 'because he was the chief speaker.' "—Tarbell's Teacher? Guide.
      6. How did the priest of Jupiter think to honor the visitors to his city?
Who would have joined in this service? Verse 13.
      NOTE.—Writers tell us that it was customary to make ropes of red roses
and scarlet geranium, entwined with myrtle and bay leaves, and wreathe the
glossy bodies, thick necks, and long horns of the oxen with these garlands..
Sacrificing the oxen meant to cut their throats, receive the blood in a vessel,
and pour it on the altar.
      7. What hindered the carrying out of their purpose? What did Paul
say of himself and his associates? How did he make this an occasion to
reveal to the people the only true and living God? Verses 14, 15.
      NOTE.—"The apostles endeavored to impart to these idolaters a knowledge
of God the Creator, and of His Son, the Saviour of the human race. They first
directed attention to the wonderful works of God,—the sun, the moon, and the
stars, the beautiful order of the recurring seasons, the mighty snow-capped
mountains, the lofty trees, and other varied wonders of nature, which showed
a skill beyond human comprehension. Through these works of the Almighty,
the apostles led the minds of the heathen to a contemplation of the great Ruler
of the universe."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 180.
      8. What had God allowed all nations to do? What witness of His love
had He constantly given? How did,this description of the true God affect
the people of Lystra? Verses 16-18.
      NOTE.—"His witness is everywhere. Rays of light are refracted through
drops of water, and the rainbow hangs in the sky. It is God's witness. The
trees of the orchard hang full of ripened fruit, colored and tinted with color
combinations no hand can reproduce. It is God's witness. The fields of grain
bow in golden waves as the gentle breeze touches them lightly. It is God's
witness. The storm king summons his forces, and rushes forth with a fury and
menace that strikes fear to the unthinking. It is God's witness, for 'the voice
of the Lord is upon the waters: the God of glory thundereth: the Lord is
upon many waters.' Ps. 29:3."—Practical Commentary.
      9. How was public opinion quickly turned against the apostles? To
what extent was this persecution carried? Acts 14:19.
                       Paul Miraculously Saved
   10. How was the power of the Lord shown as the believers stood around
the body of Paul? Where did he and Barnabas go the next day? Verse 20.
   NorE.—"Among those who had been converted at Lystra, and who were
eyewitnesses of the sufferings of Paul, was one who was afterward to become a
prominent worker for Christ, and who was to share with the apostle the trials
and the joys of pioneer service in difficult fields. This was a young man named

Timothy. When Paul was dragged out of the city, this youthful disciple was
among the number who took their stand beside his apparently lifeless body,
and who saw him arise, bruised and covered with blood, but with praises upon
his lips because he had been permitted to suffer for the sake of Christ."—The
Acts of the Apostles, pages 184, 185.
    The stoning of Paul may have been the turning point in the life of Timothy,
even as the stoning of Stephen influenced Paul toward the gospel.
   11. After preaching in Derbe, what cities did the apostles. revisit? How
did they encourage the believers? How must we enter the kingdom of God?
Verses 21, 22.
                  Essential Organization Perfected
    12. How was the organization of each church perfected? To whom
were they commended? Verse 23.
    NOTE.—"This was in harmony with the gospel plan of uniting in one body
all believers in Christ, and this plan Paul was careful to follow throughout his
ministry. Those who in any place were by his labor led to accept Christ as the
Saviour, were, at the proper time, organized into a church."—The Acts of the
Apostles,'pages 185, 186.
    13. Through what provinces did they now pass? Where did they again
preach? From what port did they sail for home? Verses 24-26.

               Reporting Results at Antioch in Syria
    14. What did they rehearse to the church at Antioch in Syria? What
part did they especially emphasize? What is said of their stay in Antioch?
Verses 27, 28.
    NoTE.--What a remarkable missionary meeting that must have been when
Paul and Barnabas returned to Antioch and rehearsed to the believers all that
the Lord had done through them, and how churches had been established at
different places! The theme of their report was, "How He [God] had opened
the door of faith unto the Gentiles." There was no self-glory, no complaint of
sufferings, no discouragement on account of opposition. The ever-present help
of the Spirit of God was set forth, the truth of the gospel was made plain, and
the assurance given of greater fruit in heathen lands. All their victories had
been obtained through faith in the name of Christ. The interest of the church
at Antioch was extended to Gentile converts in foreign fields. The report at
this first missionary meeting at Antioch is given by one writer as follows:
    "1. They had been gone probably two years.
    "2. They had visited Cyprus, Pamphylia, Pisidia, and Lycaonia, traveling
about 1400 miles.
    "3. They had preached in the largest cities of these regions, and had
founded churches wherever they went, organizing them on a permanent footing.
    "4. They had gone first to the synagogues and preached to the Jews, win-
ning many converts and making many bitter enemies.
    "5. The force of circumstances as well as the promptings of the Holy Spirit
had led them to extend the good news to the Gentiles, many of whom had
gladly accepted it. This was the greatest forward step since Christ's ascension.
    "6. They had shown how Christians can endure persecution, and thus had
set an inspiring example for the church in all ages.
    "7. They had won a notable leader, Timothy.
    "8. They had set on foot the vast enterprise of foreign missions."

   Review the journey from place to place as set forth in last week's lesson,
continuing the story as given in Acts 14, and landing the apostles back in Anti-
och, Syria, the place from which they were sent out. This completes the first
missionary trip of the apostle Paul.

                        Think on These Things
   The courage necessary to pioneer in new places.
   The effect upon others of cheerfully enduring persecution.
   God's marvelous power available to His faithful servants.



                     Lesson 9, for March 1, 1941
            The General Council in Jerusalem
   SCRIPTURE: Acts 15:1-35.
   MEMORY VERSE: "Where no counsel is, the people fall: but in the multitude of
counselors there is safety." Prov. 11:14.
   STUDY HELP: "The Acts of the Apostles," pages 188-197.
   PLACES: Judea, Jerusalem; Phenice and Samaria; Antioch in Syria.
   PERSONS: Men from Judea; reference to Moses; Paul and Barnabas; apostles
 and elders at Jerusalem; Peter; James; Judas; Silas; greetings to Gentiles.

                          Setting of the Lesson
    In every age the preaching of the gospel has been attended by difficulties.
In the days of the early church the errors taught by certain Jewish converts
was a great perplexity. These insisted that Jewish laws and ceremonies should
be made a part of the Christian religion. They were slow to see that after the
death of Christ the rites and ceremonies of the Mosaic dispensation were no
longer binding.
    Paul and Barnabas "abode long time" with the church at Antioch in Syria.
It was during this time that the dispute arose with which today's lesson has
to do. This difficulty between brethren must be settled even though it meant
going to Jerusalem, which was three hundred miles away. To talk over matters,
to investigate the facts until all understood and were agreed, was the course
taken.
                  False Teaching Stirs Controversy
    1. What erroneous teaching caused trouble in the church at Antioch in
Syria? Acts 15:1.
    NOTE.—"While the apostles united with the ministers and lay members at
Antioch in an earnest effort to win many souls to Christ, certain Jewish be-
lievers from Judea, 'of the sect of the Pharisees,' succeeded in introducing a
question that soon led to widespread controversy in the church, and brought
consternation to the believing Gentiles. With great assurance these Judaizing
teachers asserted that in order to be saved, one must be circumcised, and must
keep the entire ceremonial law."—The Acts of the Apostles, pages 188, 189.
    2. How did the church decide to have the question settled? As Paul and
Barnabas were "brought on their way," what did they declare? Verses 2, 3.

    NorE.—"In the church at Antioch, the consideration of the question of
circumcision resulted in much discussion and contention. Finally; the members
of the church, fearing that a division among them would be the outcome of
continued discussion, decided to send Paul and Barnabas, with some responsi-
ble men from the church, to Jerusalem, to lay the matter before the apostles
and elders. There they were to meet delegates from the different churches,
and those who had come to Jerusalem to attend the approaching festivals.
Meanwhile all controversy was to cease until a final decision should be given in
general council. This decision was then to be universally accepted by the dif-
ferent churches throughout the country."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 190.
    " 'Brought on their way.' It was not an uncommon mark of affection or
respect that a part of the church at any place should attend its chief teachers
for a short way on their journeys. (Compare 20:38; 21:16.) And for the
antiquity of the custom among the Jews, see Gen. 18:16."—The Cambridge
Bible.
                     At the Council in Jerusalem
    3. When Paul and Barnabas reached Jerusalem, by whom were they
received? How was the troublesome question introduced? Acts 15:4-6.
    4. When Peter arose to speak, what reference did he make to his former
experience (Acts 10:9-15)? With what question and statement did he
close? Acts 15:7-11.
    5. Who were the next speakers? What testimony did they bear? Verse
12.
                                     [25)
    NorE.—No doubt Paul and Barnabas told of their experiences among the
Gentiles in Antioch and on their journey. There was Elymas, stricken blind
on the island of Cyprus for opposing the word of God. There was the cripple
at Lystra restored to health by the power of God. There were the "signs and
wonders" that the Lord granted "to be done by their hands," of which no
details are recorded.
                         A Decision Is Reached
    6. Who next addressed the brethren? To whose words did James refer?
Verses 13, 14.
    NorE.—This James, probably the half brother of Jesus, was called by Paul
"the Lord's brother." Gal. 1:19. At one time when Jesus was on earth it was
said, "Neither did His brethren believe in Him," but the life Jesus lived, and
the death He died, won their hearts. Now one of these brothers was the leader
in the church at Jerusalem. He was so honest and upright that he was com-
monly called "James the Just." No one's opinion at that time had greater
weight.
    7. Of what prophecy does James say the bringing in of the Gentiles is
a fulfillment? From which one of the prophets does he quote as an illustra-
tion (Amos 9:11, 12)? Acts 15:15-18.
    NOTE.—This passage makes clear that the kingdom of God, of which David
was the representative, should, after the fall of the nation and its captivity,
be restored in .the Messiah who, as a descendant of David, was to bring back
his royal line to the throne. Then the Gentiles who call upon God in faith,
believe in Him, and worship Him, as was the case with the Gentile converts
reported by Paul and Barnabas, would be partakers with the Jews.
    8. What, therefore, was the decision of James?' Verse 19.
    9. From what four things were the Gentile converts to be asked to
abstain? What reference was made to the writings of Moses? Verses 20, 21.
             Representative Brethren Sent to Antioch
    10. Accepting the decision of James, what did the council decide to do?
Verse 22, first part.
    11. Who were named to go to Antioch and report the result of the
council? Verse 22, last part.
    12. What provision was made to insure the accuracy of the report and
decision of the council? Verse 23.
    13. What were the salient points in the letter which conveyed the de-
cision of the council? Verses 24-29.
    Nom—The message sent to the believers in Antioch may be thus briefly
summarized:
    a. The greeting.
    b. Statement of the difficulty.
    c. Other workers sent.
    d. The decision.
    e. Four things from which the Gentiles were asked to abstain.
   f. The ending.
    14. How were the message and the decision received by the church at
Antioch? Verses 30, 31.
    NOTE.—"The entire body of Christians was not called to vote upon the
                                     26 )
question. The 'apostles and elders,' men of influence and judgment, framed and
issued the decree, which was thereupon generally accepted by the Christian .
churches."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 196.
                            Silas Stays in Antioch
   15. What is said of the work of Judas and Silas? Verse 32.
   16. Where did the workers each labor for a time? Verses 33-35.
   17. What side light to the lesson topic do we have in a later admonition
given by Paul to Peter? Gal. 2:11-14. See "The Acts of the Apostles,"
pages 197-199.
                           Think on These Things
   "A little explained, a little endured,
    A little forgiven, the quarrel is cured."
    Salvation is a gift, we cannot earn it.

    Paul's Second Missionary Journey; Paul and
                  Silas at Philippi
   SCRIPTURE: Acts 15:36 to 16:40.
   MEMORY VERSE: "Sirs, what must I do to be saved? And they said, Believe
on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house." Acts 16:30, 31.
   STUDY HELPS: "The Acts of the Apostles," pages 201-220; "Early Writings,"
pages 203-205.
   PLACES: Derbe, Lystra, and Iconium; Cyprus; Galatia and Phrygia; Troas;
Philippi; in house of Lydia; in prison.
   PERSONS: Paul, Silas, Barnabas, John Mark; Timothy; Luke; Lydia, a seller of
purple dye or cloth; a slave girl and her masters; Jews and rulers; prisoners; jailer and
household.
                             Setting of the Lesson
    The trip from Antioch in Syria to Jerusalem to attend the council meeting
was made between the first and second missionary tours of the apostle Paul.
    The second missionary trip starts at Antioch in Syria, passing over the
Taurus mountains along dangerous roads infested with robbers and wild
beasts, to Derbe, Lystra, and Iconium, through the region of Phrygia and of
Galatia—exact route unknown—thence to Troas. From Troas the company
traveled by boat to the island of Samothracia, and on to Neapolis in the Roman
province of Macedonia. From Neapolis to Philippi was about ten miles.
    At Lystra, Paul chose a young man named Timothy to be his helper in place
of John Mark. He was converted as the result of Paul's labors on his first
journey. 1 Tim. 1:2. Luke, "the beloved physician," joined Paul at Troas, as
we learn from the change from "they" to "we" in verse 10.
   Paul and Barnabas Separate—Their Spheres of Labor and
                     Their Companions
   1. After remaining in Antioch, Syria, for a time, what did Paul propose
to Barnabas? Whom did Barnabas desire to take with them? Why was
Paul not willing to take John Mark? Acts 15:36-38.

        FIRST STAGE
       SECOND STAGE
---•—•THIRD STAGE

                      Paul's Second Missionary Journey
      2. As Paul and Barnabas could not agree in this matter, what did they
• decide to do? Where did each go? Whom did each take with him? Verses
  39-41.
      NorE.—In Acts 13:13, we are told that Mark left Paul and Barnabas in
  tgamuus and returned to Jerusalem. "This desertion caused Paul to judge Mark
  unfavorably, and even severely, for a time. Barnabas, on the other hand, was
  inclined to excuse him because of his inexperience. He felt anxious that Mark
  should not abandon the ministry, for he saw in him qualifications that would
  fit him to be a useful worker for Christ. . . . Paul was afterward reconciled
  to Mark, and received him as a fellow laborer."—The Acts of the Apostles,
f page 170.
     The influence of Barnabas in the work of the early church is very often
  overlooked in the more outstanding figure, the apostle Paul. It was he who
  presented Paul to the apostles, who brought Paul out of seclusion at Antioch
  and started him toward leadership, who saved John Mark for a life of valuable
  Christian ministry. He seems to have had a genius for understanding people
  and, while perhaps not so eloquent or intellectual as Paul or Peter, was one
  of the most helpful leaders in the early Christian church.
          3. What cities did Paul revisit? What young man did Paul find at
     Lystra? What is said of Timothy's parents? Acts 16:1.
          NOTE.—"Timothy or Timotheus, in the Bible (Acts 16:1; 17:14, etc.), a
     Lycaonian, the son of a Gentile father and a Jewish mother, Eunice (2 Tim.
     1:5), was born at Lystra, and was already a member of the Christian church
     there at the time of Paul's second visit. He took the place formerly occupied
     by John Mark in Paul's company, and in deference to Jewish feeling was
     circumcised. He accompanied the apostle on many of his journeys, and was
     employed by him on important missions (1 Thess. 3:2; 1 Cor. 4:17; 16:10).
     . . . His name is associated with that of Paul in the opening salutations of
     both epistles to the Thessalonians, the second epistle to the Corinthians, and
     those to the Philippians and Colossians. He was, therefore, with Paul at Rome.
     At a later date he is mentioned in Hebrews 13:23 as having undergone im-
     prisonment, but as having been released."—The Encyclopedia Britannica,
     11th edition, art. "Timothy."
       • The secret of Timothy's noble life as a youth is revealed by Paul when
     he later wrote to him, "From a child thou hast known the Holy Scriptures."
     2 Tim. 3:15.
          4. What reputation did Timothy bear? What precautionary measure
     did Paul take lest fault be found with Timothy in his future work? Acts
     16:2, 3.
          NOTE.—"As a precautionary measure, Paul wisely advised Timothy to be
     circumcised—not that God required it, but in order to' remove from the minds
     of the Jews that which might be an objection to Timothy's ministration. In
     his work Paul was to journey from city to city, in many lands, and often he
     would have opportunity to preach Christ in Jewish synagogues, as well as in
     other places of assembly. If it should be known that one of his companions in
     labor was uncircumcised, his work might be greatly hindered by the prejudice
     and bigotry of the Jews."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 204.
           5. As the missionaries visited the churches, what did they give them to
     keep? How was their work blessed? Verses 4, 5.
           6. How was Paul specially guided in his further travels? To what place
     did they finally come? Verses 6-8.
                                           ( 29)
       NOTE.—Troas was an attractive, populous city in Paul's day on the shore
. of the beautiful Aegean Sea. Straight across the waters was Macedonia. Very
  brief and simple is the story of the introduction of the gospel into Europe.
  Yet its very simplicity hides a most glorious chapter in the onward march of
  the gospel of our Saviour out of Asia into Europe where it took root and grew
  till Europe became the center of Christian lift and thought. From Europe,
  and through its peoples, the gospel has spread to all the earth. The vision of
  Paul at Troas, the Spirit's call for advance into new lands and among new peo-
  ples, is an outstanding event and decisive date in the history of the Christian
  church.
                          Called Into Macedonia
   7. What did Paul see in a night vision? Of what did all the company
 now feel sure? By what route did they sail to Macedonia? Verses 9-12.
   8. How did Paul and his company begin their work in Philippi? Who
 was the first convert? Verses 13, 14.
   9. What hospitality did Lydia urge upon the missionaries? Verse 15.
                   The Enemy Hinders Their Work
 • 10. How did the enemy seek to hinder the work at Philippi? How long
 did this continue? What did Paul one day say to the evil spirit? With
 what result? Verses 16-18.
     11. What caused the girl's masters to make trouble for Paul and Silas?
 Of what were they accused before the magistrates? Verses 19-21.
     NOTE.—"For some time the apostles endured this opposition; then under
 the inspiration of the Holy Ghost Paul commanded the evil spirit to leave the
 woman. Her immediate silence testified that the apostles were the servants of
 God, and that the demon had acknowledged them to be such and had obeyed
 their command. Dispossessed of the evil spirit and restored to her right mind,
 the woman chose to become a follower of Christ. Then her masters were
 alarmed for their craft."—The Acts of the Apostles, pages 212, 213.
     12. What did the multitude do? What punishment did Paul and Silas
 receive? Verses 22-24.
     NOTE.— A Roman scourging was a severe ordeal. The clothes of the prison-
 ers were taken off, and they were beaten with flogging sticks until their backs
 were bruised and bleeding. Faint with suffering, they were then taken to the
 inner prison which had no windows. The stocks are described as "an instru-
 ment of torture as well as of confinement, consisting of a heavy piece of wood
 with holes, into which the feet were placed in such a manner that they were
 stretched widely apart so as to cause the sufferer great pain."
               God Intervenes—The Jailer Converted
     13. What was heard at midnight? What suddenly took place? Verses
25, 26.
    NOTE.—"With astonishment the other prisoners heard the sound of prayer
 and singing issuing from the inner prison. They had been accustomed to hear
 shrieks and moans, cursing and swearing, breaking the silence of the night,
 but never before had they heard words of prayer and praise ascending from
 that gloomy cell. Guards and prisoners marveled, and asked themselves who
 these men could be, who, cold, hungry, and tortured, could yet rejoice."—
 The Acts of the Apostles, page 214.

     14. What sorely troubled the jailer? Whose voice quieted him? Verses
27, 28.
     NorE.—The jailer was responsible for the safekeeping of the prisoners,
 and if any of them escaped, he would have killed himself rather than suffer
 the disgrace of execution, the penalty for allowing prisoners to escape.
     15. When he learned that the prisoners were all there, what did he do?
 What important question did he urgently ask? What was the answer?
 Verses 29-32.
     16. How did he minister unto Paul and Silas? Verses 33, 34.
     17. What word did the magistrates send the next day? What reply did
 Paul make? What caused the magistrates to fear? Verses 35-38.
     NOTE.—"The apostles were Roman citizens, and it was unlawful to scourge
 a Roman, save for the most flagrant crime, or to deprive him of his liberty
 without a fair trial. Paul and Silas had been publicly imprisoned, and they
 now refused to be privately released without the proper explanation on the
.part of the magistrates."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 217.
     18. What did the magistrates finally do? Whom did the apostles visit
 before they left the city? Verses 39, 40.

                 At Thessalonica and Berea
    SCRIPTURE: Acts 17:1-15.
    MEMORY VERSE: "Search the Scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal
life: and they are they which testify of Me." John 5:39.
    STUDY HELPS: "The Acts of the Apostles," pages 221-233; "Education," pages

    PLACES: Thessalonica; Berea; Athens.
    PERSONS: Paul; Silas; Timothy; (Luke apparently remained at Philippi);
Greeks; chief women; Jason; the mob; Gentile believers; unbelieving Jews; noble-
minded Bereans.
                          Setting of the Lesson
    Paul, Silas, and Timothy traveled southwest from Philippi. Amphipolis was
thirty-three miles distant, near the seashore; Apollonia thirty miles farther.
Thessalonica was thirty-seven miles still farther, making a journey of about one
hundred miles. Thessalonica was a great city in Paul's day. It is now called
Salonika and still has quite a large population.
    Driven from Thessalonica, Paul and his company went sixty miles farther•
southwest to Berea.
                                      [ 31 )
                     Paul's Labor in Thessalonica
    1. What important city did Paul and his company next visit? Acts 17 :1.
    NoTE.—"After being thus 'shamefully treated' in Philippi (1 Thess. 2:2),
Paul passed on rapidly to Thessalonica, the real capital of the province and an
admirable center of influence (cf. 1 Thess. 1:8). In this great seaport there
was at least one synagogue; and for three weeks he there discussed from the
Scriptures the cardinal points in his message. . . . Some Jews believed, 'and of
the God-fearing Greeks' (semi-proselytes) a large number,including not a few of
the leading women. There was also successful work among those who turned
directly 'from idols, to serve a God living and real' (1 Thess. 1:9)."—The
Encyclopedia Britannica, 11th edition, art. "Paul."
    2. What custom did Paul follow on the Sabbath? Acts 17:2.
    3. What was the theme of Paul's preaching at Thessalonica? Verse 3.
    NoTE.—Paul called attention to the Old Testament prophecies relating to
the Messiah. He showed how those prophecies agreed with the life and teach-
ings of Jesus, making it very clear that Jesus was the Messiah, and that He had
risen from the dead as the Scriptures had foretold.
    4. What were the visible results of this plain preaching of the Scrip-
tures? Verse 4.
    5. How did the success of the apostles affect the unbelieving Jews? In
what way did they plan to stop the work? Verse 5.
    NoTE.—The Revised Version refers to the "certain lewd fellows" as "cer-
tain vile fellows of the rabble," who "gathering a crowd, set the city on an
uproar." Tarbell says, "They were men of the market place, a crowd of market
loafers; idlers who had no business of their own, and were ready for any ex-
citement or mischief that might turn up."
    6. When Paul and Silas were not found, whom did they make the object
of their attack? Verse 6.
    NoTE.—Jason was a Jewish convert. His person and his goods were inter-
posed to shield the apostles from the rabble. He seems to have been with Paul
a few years afterward. Rom. 16:21.
    7. What complaint did they make against Jason? How serious was the
charge against Paul and the believers? Acts 17:7.
    NoTE.—The charge against the apostles had a serious ring, since it involved
not only danger to public order but treason against the emperor. These people
did not seek to understand how Jesus could be King of their hearts, without
being opposed to Caesar, the Roman emperor.
    8. How did the people and the rulers feel when they heard these things?
What was required of Jason and the others? Verses 8, 9.
    NOTE.—Taking "security," no doubt meant the payment of a certain sum
of money to be forfeited if anything unlawful should be done by their friends,
the missionaries.
                     Paul and Silas Sent to Berea
    9. What did the brethren do at once to protect Paul and Silas? Verse 10.
    10. What difference was found between the people of Berea and those of
Thessalonica? What was their purpose in searching the Scriptures? Verse
11.
                                    ( 32 ]
    NOTE.—"The minds of the Bereans were not narrowed by prejudice. They
were willing to investigate the truthfulness of the doctrines preached by the
apostles. . . . If, in the closing scenes of this earth's history, those to whom
testing truths are proclaimed would follow the example of the Bereans, search-
ing the Scriptures daily, and comparing with God's word the messages brought
them, there would today be a large number loyal to the precepts of God's law,
where now there are comparatively few."—The Acts of the Apostles, pages 231,
232.
    11. 'What was the result of this careful study? Verse 12.
   12. How did the enemy seek to hinder the work at Berea? Verse 13.
   NorE.—"The unbelieving Jews of Thessalonica, filled with jealousy and
hatred of the apostles, and not content with having driven them from their
own city, followed them to Berea, and aroused against them the excitable
passions of the lower class. Fearing that violence would be done to Paul if he
remained there, the brethren sent him to Athens, accompanied by some of the
Bereans who had newly accepted the faith."—The Acts of the Apostles, pages
232,233.
                         Paul Proceeds to Athens
   13. What did the brethren at once do? Who remained in Berea for a
time? Verse 14.
   14. To what place did Paul go? What message did those who took him
to Athens carry back to Berea? Verse 15.
    15. What encouragement is in this experience for those who now teach
unpopular truth?
    Answer.—"Those who today teach unpopular truths need not be dis-
couraged if at times they meet with no more favorable reception, even from
those who claim to be Christians, than did Paul and his fellow workers from
the people among whom they labored. The messengers of the cross must arm
themselves with watchfulness and prayer, and move forward with faith and
courage, working always in the name of Jesus."—The Acts of the Apostles,
page 230.

         GAVE PAUL AN
         OPENING FOR
         THE TRUTH                    OUR OPPORTUNITY




                             Setting of the Lesson
    Athens, the capital of Attica, Greece, and the great metropolis of literature
and art for the world. It was named from Athena, identified with the Roman
goddess Minerva, and was founded about 1556 s.c. Succeeding generations
and all civilized nations have acknowledged the intellectual supremacy of
Athens.
    Paul had been driven from Berea by the Jews who opposed his work at
Thessalonica. He was conducted by friends to the renowned city of Athens.
It is said that in Athens were more than three thousand public statues, the
majority of which were in honor of heathen gods. In one street there stood
before every house a square pillar upon the top of which was a statue of the
god Hermes, regarded as the herald or messenger of the gods. Every gate-
way and porch carried its protecting god. A Roman poet ironically said, "In
Athens it is easier to find gods than men."
                             A City of Many Gods
    1. While Paul waited in the city of Athens for Silas and Timothy, what
stirred his feelings? Acts 17:16.
    NOTE.—"In this great city, where God was not worshiped, Paul was op-
pressed by a feeling of solitude; and he longed for the sympathy and aid of
his fellow laborers. So far as human friendship was concerned, he felt himself
to be utterly alone. In his epistle to the Thessalonians, he expresses his feelings
in the words, 'Left at Athens alone.' Obstacles that were apparently insur-
                                         [ 34 I
mountable presented themselves before him, making it seem almost hopeless for
him to attempt to reach the hearts of the people."—The Acts of the Apostles,
page 234.
   2. How did Paul improve the opportunity this situation afforded him?
Verse 17.
   NOTE.—Paul began to preach to the Jews in the synagogue, and talked with
any who were willing to listen in the crowded market place. Around the
market were grouped the public buildings, shops, and bazaars. "Within the
square, beat the heart of the city."
   3. Whom did he encounter as he preached "Jesus, and the resurrection"?
What did some lightly ask? What did others say? Verse 18.
   NoTE.—Paul met the Greek philosophers as he began work in Athens. The
Epicureans were disciples of Epicurus, a famous teacher. They were virtually
atheists.     •
   The Stoics were a sect of heathen philosophers, believing that the Deity
was not the Creator of the universe, but its reason and soul, pervading and
organizing all matter.
                      Paul Led to the Areopagus
    4. To what place did these philosophers take Paul? What did they say
to him? Verses 19, 20.               •
    NoTE.—On the summit of the rugged, stony hill of Aeropagus, wa's a temple
of Mars, the god of war, and the hilltop was the meeting place of the Athenian
Council, which investigated all new teaching.
    "After discussing with them for a time, they requested him [Paul] to leave
the curious and thronging crowds of the market, which was not a proper arena
for discussion; and for the convenience of both parties, and in order to give
him a fair hearing, they led him up the steps of the Areopagus, Mars' Hill, to
the platform on its summit, where were assembled 'the noblest blood of Athens,
the first politicians, the first orators, the first philosophers; a court the most
august, not only of Athens, but of Greece, and indeed of the whole world.' It
was at this bar that Socrates was arraigned and condemned on the ground of
innovating upon the state religion. Here Paul was allowed to speak 'from the
tribune of a regular court, where both speaker and audience would be free
from disturbance.'"—Peloubet's Select Notes.
    5. What characteristic of the people of Athens is noted? Verse 21.
    6. How did Paul begin his sermon on Mars' Hill? Verse 22.
    NOTE.—This text is sometimes translated to read, "Bear witness to your
carefulness in religion." The thought seems to be that their devotions were
bestowed upon too many objects.
    7. What strange inscription had he noticed? What use did he make of
it? Verse 23.
    No-I.E.—The people sacrificed to gods to propitiate them, and keep them
from sending trouble upon the people. They built altars to all the gods known
among them, and then fearing that some other might punish them for neglect,
they erected still another altar to any god of whom they might not have
heard.
                            The Unknown God
   8. Who is the God they did not know? Of what is He the Lord? Where
does He not dwell? Verse 24.
                                        35
    NOTE.—All through the Bible the true God is distinguished as the Creator
of the heavens and the earth. See Jer. 10:10-12 ; 32:17; 51:15 ; Ps. 96:5 ; Acts
4:24; 14:15.
    9. Why does the true God need nothing we can give Him? Acts 17:25.
    10. How did Paul make known the great truth that all men are brothers?
What did he say had been before determined? Verse 26.
    11. What should this lead all to do? What is said of the Father's near-
ness to us? Verse 27.
    NOTE.—"The Greek word translated 'feel after' denotes the action of the
blind person groping after what he desires to find."—Philip Schaff.
    12. How dependent are all men upon God? Whom did Paul tactfully
quote as authority for his statement? Verse 28.
    13. Why can no idol be a god? Verse 29.
    NOTE.—Children usually take the form and features of their parents. So
the apostle argued that if we are the children of God, it is plainly to be seen that
He is not made of wood, gold, silver, or marble, as are images formed by men's
hands.
        A New Day and Opportunity Opened for Athens
    14. What did Paul say of that time of ignorance? But what are all now
commanded to do? Verse 30.
    NorE.—God winks at ignorance in the sense that He overlooks it, unless it
is willful ignorance. He is so loving and merciful that He bears with the sins
of men while He tries to send them the light which would turn them away
from their sins.
    15. What is one reason why all should repent? What assurance is given
to all? Verse 31.
    16. As soon as the resurrection was mentioned, what did some do? What
did others say? Verse 32.
    NorE.—It is quite probable that the apostle's speech was stopped before it
was completed. So long as he confined himself to philosophy, even though it
were new, they would listen, but the doctrine of the resurrection was too
strange, too personal, too condemning.
    17. What was the result of the Mars' Hill sermon where Paul matched
argument with argument? Verses 33, 34.
    NOTE.—Paul was working against a philosophical background irl the minds
of these Athenian Stoics and Epicureans, and in consequence found, as would
a preacher of Christianity in our day, the philosophic mind closed to simple
truth and faith. Under the circumstances the results of his efforts are truly
remarkable.
                         Think on These Things
   The value of the wisdom of this world compared with a knowledge of God.
   The most comforting thought in the lesson—the Father is "not far from
every one of us."

   SCRIPTURE: Acts 18:1-22.
   MEMORY VERSE: "Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be
not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace: for I am with thee, and no man shall set
on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city." Acts 18:9, 10.
   STUDY HELP: "The Acts of the Apostles," pages 243-254.
   PLACES: Corinth; Ephesus; Caesarea; Jerusalem; Antioch in Syria.
    PERSONS: Paul; Silas; Timothy; Aquila and Priscilla; Claudius, emperor of
Rome; Justus; Crispus; Gallio; Sosthenesl Jews and Greeks.

                            Setting of the Lesson
   "During the first century of the Christian Era, Corinth was one of the
leading cities, not only of Greece, but of the world. Greeks, Jews, and Romans,
with travelers from every land, thronged its streets, eagerly intent on business
and pleasure. A great commercial center, situated within easy access of all
parts of the Roman empire, it was an important place in which to establish
memorials for God and His truth."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 243.
   Paul probably made the trip from Athens to Corinth by sea. So completely
given over to evil was this commercial city that "as wicked as Corinth" and
"to Corinthianize" became proverbs. Paul remained in Corinth a year and a
half. He then went to Ephesus, touched at Caesarea, thence to Jerusalem, and
back to Antioch in Syria, the place of his ordination. Thus Paul ended his
second missionary journey.
                            Paul Goes to Corinth
   1. To what city did Paul go from Athens? Acts 18:1.
    2. Whom did Paul find at Corinth? Why had Aquila left Italy? Verse 2.
   NoTE.—"Among the Jews who had taken up their residence in Corinth,
were Aquila and Priscilla, who afterward became distinguished as earnest
workers for Christ. Becoming acquainted with the character of these persons,
Paul 'abode with them.' "—The Acts of the Apostles, page 243.
    3. In what secular business were Paul and Aquila associated? Verse 3.
   NOTE.—The Jews taught their sons a trade. Jesus was a carpenter, Paul
made tents.
   The trade of tentmaking, though poorly paid, is always a useful one in warm
countries. The coarse, brownish-black cloth, woven from goat's hair, of which
the tents were made, was, when properly sewed together, impervious to the
rain. Paul, doubtless, was now out of money, and he used his trade to meet
expenses.
   4. While at Corinth, what did Paul do on the Sabbath? With whom did
he reason? Verse 4.
                  Fearless Testimony Given for Christ
   5. Who now rejoined Paul? What testimony did Paul- urgently bear?
Verse 5.
   6. When he was opposed, what solemn declaration did Paul make?
Verse 6.
                             {37 1
    NOTE.—"The word [opposed] implies very strong opposition, as of a force
drawn up in battle array. It was an organized opposition."—The Cambridge
Bible.
    "The more than usually violent opposition of the Jews was no doubt stirred
up by the intense earnestness of Paul in his work after the arrival of Silas and
Timotheus when he was 'pressed and constrained by the word.' "—Philip Schaff.
    7. Leaving the synagogue, where did Paul continue to teach? Verse 7.
    NoTE.—Paul departed from the synagogue (verse 4), not from the city or
from the house of Aquila.
    8. Besides many other Corinthians, what synagogue officer of note em-
braced the gospel? Verse 8.
    NOTE.—"The hatred with which the Jews had always regarded the apostles
was now intensified. The conversion and baptism of Crispus had the effect of
exasperating instead of convincing these stubborn opposers. They could not
bring arguments to disprove Paul's preaching; and for lack of such evidence,
they resorted to deception and malignant attack. They blasphemed the gospel
and the name of Jesus. . . . Though Paul had a measure of success in Corinth,
yet the wickedness that he saw and heard in that corrupt city almost disheart-
ened him. . . . He doubted the wisdom of trying to build up a church from
the material that he found there."—The Acts of the Apostles, pages 249, 250.
                           God Speaks to Paul
    9. How was Paul encouraged to remain longer in Corinth? How long did
he stay there? Verses 9-11.
   10. In their violent opposition, what accusation did the Jews make
against Paul when Gallio became governor? Verses 12, 13.
   NoTE.—The greater success that Paul now had aroused the Jews to very
determined opposition, and he was brought before the new governor. History
describes him as "the pleasant Gallio."
                         The Accusers Punished
    11. How did this man of integrity dispose of the case, even before Paul
had made any defense? Verses 14-16.
    NoTE.—"Gallio was a man of integrity, and he refused to become the dupe
of the jealous, intriguing Jews. Disgusted with their bigotry and self-righteous-
ness, he would take no notice of the charge. As Paul prepared to speak in self-
defense, Gallio told him that it was not necessary."—The Acts of the Apostles,
page 253.
    12. How did the Greeks then treat Sosthenes who was now in the place
of the converted Crispus? How was Gallio's favor toward Paul still further
shown? Verse 17.
    NoTE.—"For the first time during Paul's labors in Europe, the mob turned
to his side; under the very eye of the proconsul, and without interference from
him, they violently beset the most prominent accusers of the apostle. . . .
Thus Christianity obtained a signal victory."—The Acts of the Apostles, page
253.
                The Second Missionary Journey Ends
  13. After spending a year and a half in Corinth, where did Paul go?
Who accompanied him to Ephesus? Verses 18, 19.
                                     [88)
    14. What did the people of Ephesus wish him to do? What reason did
he give for not remaining? What promise for the future did he make?
Verses 20, 21.
    15. After sailing from Ephesus, where did Paul land? What church did
he then salute? Answer.—Jerusalem. To what place did he then return,
ending his second missionary journey? Verse 22.
                  Trace the Second Missionary Tour
    Starting from Antioch in Syria, Paul went by land over the mountains,
visiting the churches in Cilicia and Galatia. Especial mention is made of his
second visit to Derbe and Lystra.
   While seeking to go northward into Mysia and Bithynia, he was hindered
by the Spirit, and finally came to Troas.
   At Troas he was given a vision of the man of Macedonia praying for help,
and Paul and his friends came to Philippi.
    From Philippi he went to Thessalonica, thence to Berea, thence to Athens,
thence to Corinth.
    From Corinth he went to Ephesus, but would not remain on account of his
desire to attend the feast of the Passover at Jerusalem.
    Leaving Ephesus, he sailed to Caesarea, then went to Jerusalem and saluted
the church, returning to Antioch in Syria.
                        Think on These Things
   To labor with our hands is honorable.
   If we are right with God, we need not fear what man can do to harm us,
but this knowledge should make us very humble, not proud.

THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING—MARCH 29, 1941
            Inter-American Division
    On the Thirteenth Sabbath of the third quarter of 1936, when we gave to
the Inter-American Division, the overflow amounted to $4,968 ; the first quarter
of 1939, when we also gave to this division, the overflow was somewhat larger,
amounting to $6,864.04. On March 29, again we have an opportunity to give
to this needy field. The gospel is spreading rapidly in this division, as will be
seen by the map. Each cross represents a church. Where room was insuffi-
cient to place crosses, the figures tell the number of churches in the island or
conference, as Jamaica 117; Panama 34. The unentered sections are in solid
black, the shaded portions are entered but not definitely worked.
    The president of this division pleads for a larger overflow than ever in the
past. When members of this denomination in certain sections of this field make
the supreme sacrifice by being martyrs for their faith, should not we who can
worship God without persecution, sacrifice of our means to give the gospel to
those who, in their ignorance and superstition, persecute and take the lives of
His people? The overflow on March 29 will largely be used to furnish greatly
needed facilities in buildings and equipment for the two rapidly growing
Spanish training schools in Cuba and Colombia. From these schools will go
those who will help give the message to the many in darkness in the Inter-
American field. Let eatch one sacrifice to this end on the thirteenth Sabbath.
    When the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering reaches $60,000, there is an over-
flow of $2,000. Our Sabbath school members can make this overflow as large
as they wish, for it is increased by 20 per cent of all that is given beyond $60,000.
