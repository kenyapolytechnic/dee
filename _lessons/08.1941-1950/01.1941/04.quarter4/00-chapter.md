             This Individual Sabbath School Offering Goal chart
          will appear in each Quarterly. Systematic giving week by
          week is becoming more and more a practice, and this
          chart is inserted by request. Many Sabbath school mem-
          bers are giving a dollar or more each week, and this goal
          chart will enable them to keep an accurate record of their
          covenant with God.

             "God has devised a plan by which all may give as He
          has prospered them, and which will make giving a habit
          without waiting for special calls. Those who can do this,
          but will not because of their selfishness, are robbing their
          Creator, who has bestowed upon them means to invest in
          His cause to advance its interests."—Testimonies, vol. 3,
          p. 411.

 CHRISTIAN EXPERIENCE AND GROWTH

                     Lesson 1, for October 4, 1941
                        The Problem of Sin
   MEMORY VERSE: "The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life
through Jesus Christ our Lord." Rom. 6:23.
   STUDY HELP: "Patriarchs and Prophets," pages 33-43.
   THEME THOUGHT: "We can never appreciate the wonders of atoning grace
unless we understand the awful nature and ravages of the evil which made the atone-
ment necessary."—Meade MacGuire, "The Life of Victory," page 11.

                                 Lesson Brief
    Without a view of God's holy law, and of "the Lamb of God, which taketh
away the sin of the world," there can be no appreciation of the enormity of
sin; and without faith in His atoning blood, leading to confession, repentance,
and full surrender to God, the new birth is impossible. This experience must
be followed by daily surrender to God, if we would make advancement in the
more abundant life. Sin must be dealt with in all its magnitude through a
power correspondingly great and as real, but more effective. Only by the
blood of Christ can you ever find pardon, and only by the ministry of the
Holy Spirit can you ever achieve unto Christian growth and heavenly joy.
The road to this life is through the portals of death—the death of Christ. It
also requires the death of the "old man," the death to sin.

                          Man Sinful by Nature
    1. How is man's natural state described? Rom. 3:23; Gal. 3:22.
    NoTE.—Man, cursed with the original sin of Adam, is a sinner by nature.
Christ is "the great Healer of spiritual disease. What though the whole head
was sick and the whole heart faint? what though from the sole of the foot even
unto the crown of the head there was no soundness, but wounds, and bruises,
and putrefying sores? He who had been walking frowardly in the way of his
heart might find healing by turning to the Lord. 'I have seen his ways,' the
Lord declared, 'and will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts
unto him.' "—Prophets and Kings, page 315.
    2. What is sin? 1 John 3:4, R. V.; Rom. 7:12, 13.
    NOTE.—The Revised Version of 1 John 3:4 reads: "Everyone that doeth
sin doeth also lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness."
    The law of God goes far beyond the overt act. Its decisions are based on
the heart's inner motives. In the Sermon on the Mount, Christ showed that
                                      t3]
sin involved the inner life first of all. Many do not comprehend this, or, if
they do, disregard such common sins as selfishness, impatience, irritation,
worry, jealousy, mental impurity, pride, backbiting, and the like.
    3. With whom did sin originate? Ezek. 28:12-19; 1 John 3:8; John
8:44.
   NOTE.—"Sin originated with him, who, next to Christ, had been most hon-
ored of God, and was highest in power and glory among the inhabitants of
heaven."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 35.
    "Of Lucifer the Lord says, 'Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and
perfect in beauty.' [See Ezek. 28:12.] Lucifer had been the covering cherub.
He had stood in the light of God's presence. He had been the highest of all
created beings, and had been foremost in revealing God's purposes to the uni-
verse. After he had sinned, his power to deceive was the more deceptive, and
the unveiling of his character was the more difficult, because of the exalted
position he had held with the Father."—The Desire of Ages, pages 758, 759.
   4. How did sin fasten itself on the human family? Gen. 3:1-6; Rom.
5:12.
   5. What is the final result of sin? Rom. 6:23; James 1:15.
   6. What did the Jews regard as a symbol of sin?
  ANSWER.—"Among the Jews it [the leprosy] was regarded as a judg-
ment on account of sin, and hence was called `the stroke,' 'She finger of God.'
Deep-rooted, ineradicable, deadly, it was looked upon as a symbol of sin."—
The Ministry of Healing, page 67.
   7. Through what do men stand convicted of sin? Rom. 3:20; 7:7.
  NOTE.—"The law is God's great moral looking glass."—Testimonies to
Ministers, page 125.
     8. What is the terrible consequence of cherishing any known sin?
James 2:10.
    NOTE.—"It is a perilous thing to allow an unchristian trait to live in the
the heart. One cherished sin will, little by little, debase the character, bringing
all its nobler powers into subjection to the evil desire. The removal of one
safeguard from the conscience, the indulgence of one evil habit, one neglect
of the high claims of duty, breaks down the defenses of the soul, and opens
the way for Satan to come in and lead us astray. The only safe course is to
let our prayers go forth daily from a sincere heart, as did David, 'Hold up
my goings in Thy paths, that my footsteps slip not.' "—Patriarchs and Proph-
ets, page 452.

        Penalties for Sin—Promises to Repentant Sinners
    9. What is the unpardonable sin? Matt. 12:31, 32.
   NoTE.—When the Pharisees heard the inquiry of the people, "Is not this the
Son of David?" "they said, contemptuously, 'This fellow doth not cast out
devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils' These words were inspired
by Satan. The enmity and prejudice of the rulers were stirred into a fury
of madness; and priests and rulers, Pharisees and Sadducees, united in pouring
forth their hatred. From the treasure house of their hard, stubborn hearts
                                     [4 ]
came the words, 'This fellow doth not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the
prince of the devils' They could not ignore Christ's wonderful works, or at-
tribute them to natural causes, so they said, They are the works of the devil.
In unbelief they spoke of the Son of God as a human being. The works of
healing done before them, works which no man had ever done or could do,
were a manifestation of the power of God. But they charged Christ with be-
ing in league with hell. Their talent of speech was used to abuse the world's
Redeemer, and the recording angel wrote their words in the books of heaven.
They attributed to satanic agencies the holy power of God, manifested in the
works of Christ. Thus the Pharisees sinned against the Holy Ghost. Stub-
born, sullen, ironhearted, they determined to close their eyes to all evidence,
and thus they committed the unpardonable sin."—Mrs. E. G. White, in
Review and Herald, Jan. 18, 1898.
    "The unpardonable sin is not some particular transgression which God re-
fuses to forgive, even though it be repented of, but instead it is the sinful con-
tinual hardening of the heart against the Spirit's voice until the conscience is
seared and the heart so hardened that His voice can no longer be recognized.
The continued transgression of any command of God, the willful and re-
peated indulgence of any sin, may therefore lead to the sin against the Holy
Ghost."—William H. Branson, The Holy Spirit, page 142.
    10. What will be the ultimate fate of the originator of sin, of sin it-
self, and of the unrepentant sinner? Heb. 2:14, 15; Jude 14, 15; Rev.
20:10, 14, 15.
    11. What promises give assurance of victory over sin? Rom. 6:14; 8:2.
    12. In whom may we triumph? What will then be made manifest
through us? 2 Cor. 2:14.
    13. How complete is the work of cleansing to be wrought in us? 1 John
1:7, 9.
   NOTE.—"The work of Christ in cleansing the leper from his terrible dis-
ease is an illustration of His work in cleansing the soul from sin. The man who
came to Jesus was 'full of leprosy' Its deadly poison permeated his whole
body. The disciples sought to prevent their Master from touching him; for
he who touched a leper became himself unclean. But in laying His hand upon
the leper, Jesus received no defilement. His touch imparted life-giving power.
The leprosy was cleansed. Thus it is with the leprosy of sin,—deep-rooted,
deadly, and impossible to be cleansed by human power. 'The whole head is
sick, and the whole heart faint. From the sole of the foot even unto the
head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrefying
sores.' But Jesus, coming to dwell in humanity, receives no pollution. His
presence has healing virtue for the sinner. Whoever will fall at His feet,
saying in faith, 'Lord, if Thou wilt, Thou canst make me clean,' shall hear the
answer, 'I will; be thou made clean"'—The Desire of Ages, page 266.


              THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING

                    Lesson 2, for October 11, 1941

                       Life Through Christ .
    MEMORY VERSE: "God so loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son,
that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life." John
3:16.
   STUDY HELP: "Steps to Christ," chapter, "The Sinner's Need of Christ."
   THEME THOUGHT: "'Every good gift and every perfect gift' is from God.
There is no true excellence of character apart from Him. And the only way to God is
Christ. He says, 'I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the
Father, but by Me.' "—"Steps to Christ," pages 23, 24.

                                Lesson Brief
    Through sin man finds himself without hope and without God in the
world. "The wages of sin is death"—death confronts every son and daughter
of Eve. Into this hopeless picture the Son of God presents Himself. Because
of His infinite love, He took upon Himself the form of a man and the frailties
of a long ancestral line. Having accepted human nature, He endured the sen-
tence of sin in His body on the cross. He suffered the death that is ours be-
cause of sin, that we might live the life that He merited because of righteous-
ness. This was the only avenue by which man might escape the penalty of
sin and enter into life—the more abundant life here, and everlasting life in
the eternal kingdom.
                          Man Lost—Hope Born
    1. What came upon all men as a result of Adam's transgression? Rom.
5:12.
    NoTE.—"The tide of woe that flowed from the transgression of our first
parents, is regarded by many as too awful a consequence for so small a sin;
and they impeach the wisdom and justice of God in His dealings with man.
But if they would look more deeply into this question, they might discern
their error. God created man after His own likeness, free from sin. The earth
was to be peopled with beings only a little lower than the angels; but their
obedience must be tested; for God would not permit the world to be filled
with those who would disregard His law. Yet, in His great mercy, He ap-
pointed Adam no severe test. And the very lightness of the prohibition made
the sin exceedingly great."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 60.
    2. Before our first parents heard the sentence of death through sin,
what assurance was given them? Gen. 3:15.
    NoTE.—"Adam and Eve stood as criminals before the righteous Judge,
awaiting the sentence which transgression had incurred ; but before they heard
of the life of toil and sorrow which must be their portion, or of the decree that
they must return to dust, they listened to words that could not fail to give
them hope. Though they must suffer from the power of their mighty foe,
they could look forward to final victory."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 66.
    "Adam listened to the words of the tempter, and yielding to his insinua-
tions, fell into sin. Why was not the death penalty at once enforced in his
case?—Because a ransom was found. God's only-begotten Son volunteered
to take the sin of man upon Himself, and to make an atonement for the fallen
race. There could have been no pardon for sin had this atonement not been
made. Had God pardoned Adam's sin without an atonement, sin would have
                                      {6 ]
been immortalized, and would have been perpetuated with a boldness that
would have been without restraint. Remember how soon after the trans-
gression of Adam the apostasy of his posterity became so marked that God re-
pented that He had made man."—Mrs. E. G. White, in Review and Herald,
April 23, 1901.
                         Life Renewed in Christ
    3. What was the mission of Christ to this earth? John 10:10; 3:16.
    NOTE.—"To the believer, Christ is the resurrection and the life. In our
Saviour the life that was lost through sin is restored; for He has life in Him-
self to quicken whom He will. He is invested with the right to give immor-
tality. The life that He laid down in humanity, He takes up again, and gives
to humanity."—The Desire of Ages, pages 786, 787.
    4. What was involved in making this life available to man? 1 Peter
3:18; Rom. 5:10; Heb. 2:9, 14.
     5. What prompted the great sacrifice that sets us free from the curse of
sin? John 15:13; 13:1.
    NoTE.—"This great sacrifice was not made in order to create in the Fa-
ther's heart a love for man, not to make Him willing to save. No, no 'God
so loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son' The Father loves
us, not because of the great propitiation, but He provided the propitiation
because He loves us. Christ was the medium through which He could pour out
His infinite love upon a fallen world. 'God was in Christ, reconciling the world
unto Himself.' God suffered with His Son. In the agony of Gethsemane, the
death of Calvary, the heart of Infinite Love paid the price of our redemption."
—Steps to Christ, page 15.
     6. How complete was the victory of Christ over the enemy? John 16:
33; 14:30; Rev. 3:21.
    NoTE.—"Satan assailed Christ with his fiercest and most subtle tempta-
tions; but he was repulsed in every conflict. Those battles were fought in
our behalf; those victories make it possible for us to conquer. Christ will give
strength to all who seek it. No man without his own consent can be overcome
by Satan. The tempter has no power to control the will or to force the soul
to sin. He may distress, but he cannot contaminate. He can cause agony, but
not defilement. The fact that Christ has conqUered should inspire His fol-
lowers with courage to fight manfully the battle against sin and Satan."—
 The Great Controversy, page 510.

                       Accepting Christ's Victory
    7. How do we enter into this victory? 1 Cor. 15:57; Ps. 20:5, R. V.;
Col. 1:27.
   NoTE.—The Revised Version of Psalm 20:5 reads: "We will triumph in
Thy salvation [margin, "victory"], and in the name of our God we will set
up our banners."
    8. What does this victory make possible for us? 2 Cor. 2:14.
   NorE.—"Our growth in grace, our joy, our usefulness,—all depend upon
our union with Christ. It is by communion with Him, daily, hourly,—by abid-
ing in Him,—that we are to grow in grace. He is not only the author but
the finisher of our faith. It is Christ first and last and always. He is to be with
                                       [7]
 us, not only at the beginning and the end of our course, but at every step
 of the way."—Steps to Christ, pages 73, 74.
     "A soul united with Christ, eating His flesh and drinking His blood, in
accepting and living by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God,
will war against all transgression and every approach of sin. He becomes
 every day more like a bright and shining light, and more victorious. He goes
on from strength to strength, not from weakness to weakness."—Testimonies
to Ministers, page 441.
     9. To what is this experience likened? 1 Peter 1:23; John 3:3, 5.
     NorE.—"Not all the wisdom and skill of man can produce life in the small-
 est object in nature. It is only through the life which God Himself has im-
parted, that either plant or animal can live. So it is only through the life
 from God that spiritual life is begotten in the hearts of men. Unless a man is
 `born from above,' he cannot become a partaker of the life which Christ came
to give."—Steps to Christ, page 71.
    "The Spirit of God through faith produces a new life in the soul. The
thoughts and desires are brought into obedience to the will of Christ. The
heart, the mind, are created anew in the image of Him who works in us to
subdue all things to Himself."—The Desire of Ages, page 176.
     10. Through what agency is the new birth effected? John 3:5; 6:63.
    NoTE.—"The Spirit was to be given as a regenerating agent, and without
this the sacrifice of Christ would have been of no avail. The power of evil
had been strengthening for centuries, and the submission of men to this satanic
captivity was amazing. Sin could be resisted and overcome only through the.
mighty agency of the Third Person of the Godhead, who would come with no
modified energy, but in the fullness of divine power. It is the Spirit that
makes effectual what has been wrought out by the world's Redeemer. It is by
the Spirit that the heart is made pure. Through the Spirit the believer be-
comes a partaker of the divine nature. Christ has given His Spirit as a divine
power to overcome all hereditary and cultivated tendencies to evil, and to
impress His own character upon His church.
    "Of the Spirit Jesus said, 'He shall glorify Me. The Saviour came to
glorify the Father by the demonstratior of His love; so the Spirit was to glorify
Christ by revealing His grace to the world. The very image of God is to be
reproduced in humanity. The honor of God, the honor of Christ, is involved
in the perfection of the character of His people."—The Desire of Ages, page
671.
    11. How perfect will the church of Christ be at His coming? Isa. 54:
11-14; 1 John 3:2.
    NorE.—"Those who are living upon the earth when the intercession of
Christ shall cease in the sanctuary above, are to stand in the sight of a holy
God without a mediator. Their robes must be spotless, their characters must be
purified from sin by the blood of sprinkling. Through the grace of God and
their own diligent effort, they must be conquerors in the battle with evil.
While the investigative judgment is going forward in heaven, while the sins of
penitent believers are being removed from the sanctuary, there is to be a
special work of purification, of putting away of sin, among God's people upon
earth. This work is more clearly presented in the messages of Revelation 14.
    "When this work shall have been accomplished, the followers of Christ
will be ready for His appearing. 'Then shall the offering of Judah and Jeru-
                                       [ 81
salem be pleasant unto the Lord, as in the days of old, and as in former years.'
Then the church which our Lord at His coming is to receive to Himself will
be 'a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing' Then
she will look forth 'as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and ter-
rible as an army with banners.' "—The Great Controversy, page 425.
    12. In what language did the prophet John describe the final victory
of the church? Rev. 19:7, 8; 14:1-5.



                    Lesson 3, for October 18, 1941
                       Choice and Obedience
    MEMORY VERSE: "Choose you this day whom ye will serve; . . but as for
me and my house, we will serve the Lord." Joshua 24:15. .
    STUDY HELP: "Steps to Christ," chapter, "The Test of Discipleship."
   THEME THOUGHT: "The tempted one needs to understand the true force of
the will. This is .he governing power in the nature of man,—the power of decision, of
choice. Everything depends on the right action of the will."—"The Ministry of Heal-
ing," page 176.
                                  Lesson Brief
    God says, "I have set before you life and death, . . . therefore choose
life." "You cannot change your heart, you cannot of yourself give to God
its affections; but you can choose to serve Him. You can give Him your will;
He will then work in you to will and to do according to His good pleasure.
Thus your whole nature will be brought under the control of the Spirit of
Christ; your affections will be centered upon Him, your thoughts will be in
harmony with Him.
    "Desires for goodness and holiness are right as far as they go; but if you
stop here, they will avail nothing. Many will be lost while hoping and desir-
ing to be Christians. They do not come to the point of yielding the will to
God. They do not now choose to be Christians."—Steps to Christ, page 52.
                          A Matter of Choice
    1. Upon what were life and righteousness dependent in the beginning?
Gen. 2:16, 17.
    NoTE.—"God might have created man without the power to transgress His
law; He might have withheld the hand of Adam from touching the forbidden
fruit; but in that case man would have been, not a free moral agent, but a
mere automaton. Without freedom of choice, his obedience would not have
been voluntary, but forced. There could have been no development of char-
acter. Such a course would have been contrary to God's plan in dealing with
the inhabitants of other worlds. It would have been unworthy of man as an
intelligent being, and would have sustained Satan's charge of God's arbitrary
rule.
    "God made man upright; He gavb him noble traits of character, with no
bias toward evil. He endowed him with high intellectual powers, and presented
before him the strongest possible inducements to be true to his allegiance.
Obedience, perfect and perpetual, was the condition of eternal happiness. On
this condition he was to have access to the tree of life."—Patriarchs and
Prophets, page 49.
                                     [9}
    2. What evidence have we that life and death are still a matter of
choice? Deut. 30:19; Matt. 7:13, 14.
    3. What is the invitation of the Scriptures? Matt. 11:28; Rev. 22:17;
Isa. 55:3.
    4. What is the proper response to this invitation? Joshua 24:24; Ps.
116:13.
    NOTE.—"God has given us the power of choice; it is ours to exercise. We
cannot change our hearts, we cannot control our thoughts, our impulses, our
affections. We cannot make ourselves pure, fit for God's service. But we can
choose to serve God, we can give Him our will; then He will work in us to
will and to do according to His good pleasure. Thus our whole nature will be
brought under the control of Christ."—The Ministry of Healing, page 176.
                    The Results of a Right Choice
    5. What is said of him who chooses to do the will of God? John 7:17.
    6. How only can one be assured of God's favor? Ex. 19:5, 6; 1 Sam.
15:22.
    7. What makes salvation effective in the life and produces the works of
obedience? Eph. 2:8; James 2:26.
    NOTE.—Desire and pretense, or even works—good works—cannot of them-
selves fulfill the demands of heaven or be construed to take the place of simple,
wholehearted, perfect obedience.
    "We do not earn salvation by our obedience; for salvation is the free gift
of God, to be received by faith."—Steps to Christ, page 66. Yet "faith without
works is dead." Thus salvation is dependent upon taking and receiving it. We
do this through the mental process, a choice prompted by faith, and through an
act, obedience.
    8. Cite some of the promises made to the obedient. Isa. 1:19, 20; 2
Peter 1:10, 11.
    NoTE.—"The condition of eternal life is now just what it always has been,
—just what it was in Paradise before the fall of our first parents,—perfect
obedience to the law of God, perfect righteousness. If eternal life were granted
on any condition short of this, then the happiness of the whole universe would
be imperiled. The way would be open for sin, with all its train of woe and
misery, to be immortalized."—Steps to Christ, page 67.
                     Companionship in Obedience
    9. What example in obedience did Christ set us? John 4:34; 6:38;
Matt. 26:39, 42.
    10. What fellowship is promised to the obedient? John 15:10; Heb.
5:8, 9.
    NoTE.—"That so-called faith in Christ which professes to release men from
the obligation of obedience to God, is not faith, but presumption. 'By grace are
ye saved through faith.' But 'faith, if it hath not works, is dead.' Jesus said
of Himself before He came to earth, 'I delight to do Thy will, 0 My God; yea,
Thy law is within My heart.' And just before He ascended again to heaven
He declared, 'I have kept My Father's commandments, and abide in His love.'
The Scripture says, 'Hereby we do know that we know Him, if we keep His
                                     1101
commandments. . . . He that saith he abideth in Him ought himself also so
to walk, even as He walked.' Because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us
an example, that ye should follow His steps.'"—Steps to Christ, pages 66, 67.
    11. In what similar relationships do we stand with Jesus before the
world? John 17:18; 1 John 4:17.
    NOTE.—"Jesus was tempted in all points like as we are, that He might
know how to succor those who should be tempted. His life is our example. He
shows by His willing obedience that man may keep the law of God, and that
transgression of the law, not obedience to it, brings him into bondage."—Tes-
timonies, vol. 4, p. 294.
    12. How does Paul show that Christian obedience is the result of the
new birth? Phil. 2:5, 8; 2 Cor. 5:17; Rom. 8:1-4.



                     Lesson 4, for October 25, 1941
            The Place of the Spirit in Victory
    MEMORY VERSE: "Not by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit, saith the
Lord of hosts." Zech. 4:6.
    STUDY HELP: "The Holy Spirit," William H. Branson, pages 57-78.
    THEME THOUGHT: "Christ has given His Spirit as a divine power to overcome
all hereditary and cultivated tendencies to evil, and to impress His own character upon
His church."—"The Desire of Ages," page 671.

                                   Lesson Brief
    God's kingdom of grace is spiritual. They who enter this kingdom do so
through the Holy Spirit. "Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he
cannot enter into the kingdom of God." The spiritual life is the result of the
new birth. It is the outflowing of incarnate spiritual forces—"know ye not that
your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you?" Man chooses
life—the power of life—and God supplies that power through the Spirit.
Man's part in the transaction is simple and small; God's part is mysterious and
powerful. And yet without man's part, simple though it is, there can be no
entering into life, no union with God, no experience of omnipotent power
unto the more abundant life.
                     The Holy Spirit and the Sinner
   1. What are some of the terms by which the divine Spirit is designated?
   ANSWER.—Comforter, John 14:26; Spirit of God, Rom. 8:9; Spirit of His
Son, Gal. 4:6; Eternal Spirit, Heb. 9:14; Spirit of Grace, Heb. 10:29; Spirit
of Glory, 1 Peter 4:14; Spirit of Life, Rev. 11 :11 ; Holy Spirit, 1 Thess. 4:8;
Spirit of Truth, John 14:17; My Spirit, Zech. 4:6.
   NoTE.—By studying carefully the various names under which the Holy
Spirit is introduced through the Scriptures, we are enabled to know something
of His work. Nevertheless there will always remain a degree of mystery about
the Spirit, the Third Person of the Godhead, a mystery which Christ made no
effort to explain or clarify. It is enough for us to know His presence and ex-
perience His power; beyond this we may not penetrate,
                                        11
    2. What is the first work that the Spirit performs for the sinner? John
16:7, 8.
    NorE.—"One of the chief functions of the Holy Spirit is to implant in the
human heart the sense of sin. Jesus declared: 'And when He is come, He will
reprove [margin, convince] the world of sin.' John 16:8. Not all the mani-
festations of the Spirit bring rejoicing to the heart. There is a scourging and
chastening that must of necessity be endured before the soul is prepared to re-
joice in the Lord. Before a sick man can realize his need of a physician, he
must first be impressed with the fact and character of his illness; and so with
the sinner. Before he will flee to the Saviour for deliverance from his bondage
and guilt, he must be made to realize his lost and undone condition. This work
must be accomplished by the Holy Spirit before the sinner will take his first
step toward his Saviour. Newton has aptly said: 'No man ever did, or ever
will, feel himself to be a lost, miserable, and hateful sinner unless he be power-
fully and supernaturally convinced by the Spirit of God.' "—The Holy Spirit,
page 57.
                     The Spirit and the New Birth
     3. Into what great Christian experience does the Spirit lead the peni-
tent sinner? John 3:3, 5; 6:63.
    NorE.—"In connection with the forgiveness of sin, there is also another
work of the Spirit of God that is performed for the sinner. It is that of re-
generation. or the new birth. The Christian life does not consist simply of
a modification and reformation of the old life, but of an entirely new life that
is implanted into the soul. This is the experience David sought when, con-
fessing his sins, he prayed: 'Create in me a clean heart, 0 God: and renew a
right spirit within me.' Psalm 51:10. 'Therefore if any man be in Christ, he
is a new creature [or creation]: old things are passed away; behold, all things
are become new.' 2 Cor. 5:17."—The Holy Spirit, page 61.
    4. How close is the relationship between the newborn soul and the
Spirit? 1 Cor. 6:19, 20; Eph. 5:18.
                   The Companionship of the Spirit
     5. For what should we pray? Who helps us in our praying? Luke 11:
13; Rom. 8:26.
     6. What does the Holy Spirit do for the newborn man or woman? Isa.
59:19; Eph. 3:16-21.
    NOTE.—"Now it is not necessary that the twice-born individual should
ever again surrender to the power of sin. God has provided grace sufficient for
every possible temptation and trial. If the Spirit is granted full control of the
life He [God] declares His ability to 'save to the uttermost;' to keep from
falling; to preserve blameless; and to provide a way of escape from every
temptation. He can 'make you perfect in every good work to do His will,
working in you that which is well pleasing in His sight, through Jesus Christ.'
Hebrews 13:21.
    "The soul that is thus fully surrendered to the control of Christ through
the Spirit is secure in His keeping. The attacks of the enemy are warded off,
and the fruits of holiness are produced in the life."—The Holy Spirit, page 69.
    7. What part does the Spirit have in Christian growth and sanctifica-
tion? Rom. 8:2; 2 ThesS. 2:13.
                                     ( 12 )
    NorE.—"It is through the gracious working of the Spirit, dwelling in the
heart of the believer, that the life is sanctified and finally sealed for the king-
dom. The doctrine of sanctification is a Bible doctrine. It is God's plan that
all His true children should be sanctified and made holy by the indwelling of
the Spirit. 'For this is the will of God, even your sanctification.' 1 Thess.
4:3. And: 'God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanc-
tification of the Spirit and belief of the truth.' 2 Thess. 2:13. Heaven is a holy
place, and the God whose glory fills the temple is a holy God. It is, there-
fore, His purpose that all who dwell there with Him shall also be holy. And
without this holiness `no man shall see the Lord.' Heb. 12:14. 'I am the Lord
your God: ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for
I am holy.' Lev. 11:44."—The Holy Spirit, pages 71, 72.
    8. What fruit is produced through the Spirit in the Christian life?
Gal. 5:22, 23.
    NorE.—"Those who become new creatures in Christ Jesus will bring forth
the fruits of the Spirit, 'love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness,
faith, meekness, temperance.' They will no longer fashion themselves accord-
ing to the former lusts, but by the faith of the Son of God they will follow
in His steps, reflect His character, and purify themselves even as He is pure.
The things they once hated, they now love; and the things they once loved,
they hate. The proud and self-assertive become meek and lowly in heart. The
vain and supercilious become serious and unobtrusive. The drunken become
sober, and the profligate pure. The vain customs and fashions of the world are
laid aside. Christians will seek not the 'outward adorning,' but 'the hidden
man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek
and quiet spirit.'
    "There is no evidence of genuine repentance, unless it works reformation.
If he restore the pledge, give again that he had robbed, confess his sins, and
love God and his fellow men, the sinner may be sure that ne has passed from
death unto life."—Steps to Christ, pages 62, 63.

                        Power to Finish the Work
    9. What message is going to the world at this time? Rev. 14:6-12.
    10. For what are we to pray in the last days? Acts 2:15-21; Joel
2:23; Zech. 10:1.
   NOTE.—"Thus Pentecost is to be repeated but with a double rendering of
the Spirit's power. As 'the harvest is the end of the world,' so the latter rain
will come to ripen the grain and prepare it for the sickle. Under the latter
rain therefore there will be seen the grandest display of God's presence and
power that has ever been witnessed among men. It is thus that the work
will be cut short and finished in the earth. . . . It is through the 'remnant'
that the work will be carried on, but it is the Spirit of God who works through
them. 'He' finishes the work. 'He' cuts it short."—The Holy Spirit, page 121.
    11. What great work is in progress today? Rev. 7:1-4.
    12. What mighty power is being used in this all-important work? Eph.
4:30.
    NoTE.—"It is through the gracious working of the Spirit, . . . that the
life is . . . finally sealed for the kingdom."—The Holy Spirit, page 71.

                    Lesson 5, for November 1, 1941

                       Righteousness Imputed
    MEMORY VERSE: "He hath made Him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that
we might be made the righteousness of God in Him." 2 Cor. 5:21.
    STUDY HELP: "Steps to Christ," chapter, "Faith and Acceptance."
    THEME THOUGHT: "The thought that the righteousness of Christ is imputed to
us, not because of any merit on our part, but as a free gift from God, is a precious
thought. The enemy of God and man is not willing that this truth should be clearly
presented; for he knows that if the people receive it fully, his power will be broken."—
"Gospel Workers," page 161.
                                 Lesson Brief
     A man may be very sorry for the past,—his mistakes, his shortcomings, his
rebellion against God and His law,. his sin,—yet in spite of sorrow and regret,
it remains a fact of history, demanding penalties from which man in himself is
unable to escape. No future triumphs can erase that past nor evade that which
it merits—death. "For the wages of sin is death." Hence that past record must
be covered, blotted out by some process. Someone must pay the penalty. That
is just what Jesus does—He takes care of the past. Through dying and accept-
ing the punishment for sin, Christ has delivered us from the penalty of sin.
That is justification, sometimes called imputed righteousness. The one to whom
righteousness is imputed stands before God as though he had never sinned.
                          Man's Hopeless Condition
    1. How hopeless is man's condition because of sin? Rom. 5:12; 7:14;
Eph. 2:11, 12.
     NOTE.—"By nature we are alienated from God. The Holy Spirit describes
our condition in such words as these: 'Dead in trespasses and sins ;"the whole
head is sick, and the whole heart faint ;"no soundness in it.' We are held fast
in the snare of Satan; 'taken captive by him at his will"'—Steps to Christ,
page 47.
      2. How is the inability of man to change himself illustrated? Jer. 13:
23; Rom. 7:18-23.
     NorE.—"It is impossible for us, of ourselves, to escape from the pit of
sin in which we are sunken. Our hearts are evil, and we cannot change them.
. . . Education, culture, the exercise of the will, human effort, all have their
proper sphere, but here they are powerless. They may produce an outward
correctness of behavior, but they cannot change the heart; they cannot purify
the springs of life. . . . The idea that it is necessary only to develop the good
that exists in man by nature, is a fatal deception. 'The natural man receiveth
not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither
can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.'"—Steps to Christ,
pages 20, 21.
                    Christ's Righteousness Imputed
      3. What did Christ do for sinners? To whom then must we look for
aid? Gal. 3:13; Rom. 8:3.
     NorE.—"From the condemnation of sin as an offense against God, Christ
frees us. From the defilement of sin He cleanses us. From the sickness and
deformity of sin He heals us. From the slavery of sin He delivers us. From
                                        [ 14 )
the law of sin He frees us. All this He does for us by His death and by His
indwelling presence."—The Life of Victory, page 18.
    4. To those who accept Christ as their substitute, what is imputed?
Rom. 4:11, 23-25.
    NOTE.—"In Christ's name His followers are to stand before God. Through
the value of the sacrifice made for them, they are of value in the Lord's sight.
Because of the imputed righteousness of Christ they are accounted precious.
For Christ's sake the Lord pardons those that fear Him. He does not see in
them the vileness of the sinner. He recognizes in them the likeness of His Son,
in whom they believe."—The Desire of Ages, page 667.
    5. Before this can take place, what is necessary on man's part? Job
42:5, 6; Ezek. 20:43.
    NoTE.—"It is true that men sometimes become ashamed of their sinful
ways, and give up some of their evil habits, before they are conscious that they
are being drawn to Christ. But whenever they make an effort to reform, from
a sincere desire to do right, it ithell/Pf ower of Christ that is drawing them.
An influence of which they are unconscious works upon the soul, and the con-
science is quickened, and the outward life is amended. And as Christ draws
 them to look upon His cross, to behold Him whom their sins have pierced, the
 commandment comes home to the conscience. The wickedness of their life, the
 deep-seated sin of the soul, is revealed to them. They begin to comprehend
 something of the righteousness of Christ, and exclaim, 'What is sin, that it
 should require such a sacrifice for the redemption of its victim? Was all this
 love, all this suffering, all this humiliation demanded, that we might not perish,
 but have everlasting life?'
    "The sinner may resist this love, may refuse to be drawn to Christ; but if
 he does not resist, he will be drawn to Jesus; a knowledge of the plan of salva-
 tion will lead him to the foot of the cross in repentance for his sins, which
 have caused the sufferings of God's dear Son."—Steps to Christ, page 31.
     6. What hope is extended to those who desire to be freed from sin? Isa.
1:18; Matt. 11:28.
    NOTE.—"As you see the enormity of sin, as you see yourself as you really
 are, do not give up to despair. It was sinners that Christ came to save. We
 have not to reconcile God to us, but-0 wondrous love !—God in Christ is
 `reconciling the world unto Himself.' He is wooing by His tender love the
 hearts of His erring children. No earthly parent could be as patient with
 the faults and mistakes of his children, as is God with those He seeks to save.
 No one could plead more tenderly with the transgressor. No human lips ever
 poured out more tender entreaties to the wanderer than does He. All His
 promises, His warnings, are but the breathing of unutterable love."—Steps to
 Christ, page 40.
                       The Symbol of Justification
    7. Through what ceremony is the reality of this hope expressed? Rom.
6:3, 4.
    8. What does Christ then become to the believer? 1 Cor. 1:30; 2 Cor.
5:21.
   .NOTE.—"He who knew no sin was made sin for us. With this terrible
weight of guilt upon Him because of our sins, He withstood the fearful test
Upon appetite, and upon love of the world and of honor, and pride of dis-
                                  t 15 I
 play which leads to presumption. Christ endured these three great leading
 temptations, and overcame in behalf of man, working out for him a righteous
 character, because He knew man could not do this of himself."—Testimonies,
 vol. 3, p. 372.
     9. How is this transaction further illustrated? Zech. 3:3-5.
     NoTE.—"Notwithstanding the defects of the people of God, Christ does
 not turn away from the objects of His care. He has the power to change their
 raiment. He removes the filthy garments, He places upon the repenting, be-
lieving ones His own robe of righteousness, and writes pardon against their
 names on the records of heaven. He confesses them as His before the heavenly
 universe. Satan their adversary is shown to be an accuser and deceiver. God
will do justice for His own elect."—Christ's Object Lessons, pages 169, 170.
     10. How is justification effected? What words are used to illustrate
this experience? Jer. 23:6; Rom. 3:24-26.
    Nom.—Justification is effected by Christ, and such words as grace, faith,
propitiation, redemption, remission, alltrutiteousness, are used to illustrate
the process and its meaning.
     11. Through what is righteousness made effectual? Rom. 3:22; Eph.
2:8; Rom. 5:1.
    NOTE.—"You are a sinner. You cannot atone for your past sins, you
cannot change your heart, and make yourself holy. But God promises to do
all this for you through Christ. You believe that promise. You confess your
sins, and give yourself to God. You will to serve Him. Just as surely as you
do this, God will fulfill His word to you. If you believe the promise,—believe
that you are forgiven and cleansed,—God supplies the fact; you are made
whole, just as Christ gave the paralytic power to walk when the man be-
lieved that he was healed. It is so if you believe it."—Steps to Christ, page 55.


                    Lesson 6, for November 8, 1941
                         Living the New Life
    MEMORY VERSE: "If, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by
the death of His Son, much snore, being reconciled, we shall be saved by His life."
Rom. 5:10.
    STUDY HELP: "The Sanctified Life," Mrs. E. G. White, pages 58-63.
    THEME THOUGHT: "When we share in His life, let us remember that it is this
resurrection life. It is a life that has already triumphed in human nature over all sin,
all temptation, the world, the flesh, and the devil, death and the grave. `If we have
been planted together in the likeness of His death, we shall be also in the likeness of
His resurrection.' Rom. 6:5."—"The Life of Victory," page 61.

                                   Lesson Brief
    Through imputed righteousness the past is taken care of. Christ died to
save us from the penalty of our former sins. Adequate provision is also made
for the maintenance of a righteous life by the surrendered soul. Christ lives
to save us from the sins of the present and the fears of the future—"because I
live, ye shall live also." What Jesus did in His own earth-life, He now does
through ours. The indwelling Christ imparts here and now, moment by
                                        [16
moment, unto joy and peace, the resurrected life, the conquering life, the
victorious life. This is sometimes called imparted righteousness.
                      Evidences of Righteousness
     1. What is one of the spiritual blessings that come to one who is justi-
fied? Rom. 5:1; Isa. 32:17.
    NOTE.—"The peace of Christ is born of truth. It is harmony with God.
The world is at enmity with the law of God; sinners are at enmity with their
Maker; and as a result they are at enmity with one another. But the psalmist
declares, 'Great peace have they which love Thy law: and nothing shall offend
them.' Men cannot manufacture peace. Human plans for the purification and
uplifting of individuals or 'of society will fail of producing peace, because
they do not reach the heart. The only power that can create or perpetuate
true peace is the grace of Christ. When this is implanted in the heart, it
will cast out the evil passions that cause strife and dissension."—The Desire
of Ages, pages 302, 303.
     2. In what other way is this experience expressed? Rom. 5:10.
     NorE.—"In the new birth the heart is brought into harmony with God, as
it is brought into accord with His law. When this mighty change has taken
place in the sinner, . . . the old life of alienation from God has ended, the new
life of reconciliation, of faith and love, has begun. Then the righteousness of
the law' will 'be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the
Spirit.' And the language of the soul will be, '0 how love I Thy law ! it is my
meditation all the day.'"—The Great Controversy, page 468.
     3. What blessed freedom is thus made possible? Rom. 8:1; John 8:36.
    4. Through what agency is this experience effected? Rom. 8:2; John
6:63.
    NoTE.—"Through the death and shed blood of Christ we are justified;
through the agency of the Spirit sent forth from heaven by the ministry of
our Lord, we are sanctified. We could never be justified without His death and
resurrection, nor could we be sanctified without His life and intercession re-
sulting in the descent of the Spirit upon the church, and upon each individual
believer. Every child of God becomes a temple of the Holy Ghost. As he
yields without reserve to be filled, possessed, controlled, and led by the Spirit,
every hereditary and cultivated tendency to sin is subdued, and he receives
divine life, liberty, power, and victory."—The Life of Victory, page 91.
                      Companionship With Christ
    5. In this new life, what fellowship is enjoyed? Matt. 28:20; 1 John
1:1-3; John 17:23.
    6. What is Christ able to do for the ones with whom He dwells? Matt.
1:21; Heb. 7:25.
   NOTE.—"Is it not strange that everywhere men are praying and pleading
for what has already been graciously given? They pray for peace, but the
Father answers, 'I have already bestowed My peace upon you in Christ. Re-
ceive Him, and you have all peace.' Men pray for life, and the reply is the
same, 'I have given you eternal life. It is in My Son. Receive Him, and you
have life' Men cry to God for victory, and the answer is, 'There is no victory
for humanity except in the Victor.'
                                      [ 17 )
    "Christ took our humanity, and won everlasting victory, not for Himself,
but for men. In the same way that life and peace are gifts, so is victory a gift.
`Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory' 1 Cor. 15:57. Why do men
struggle and fight to obtain what comes as a gift in Christ? They talk of
victory on this point and victory on that point, when if they would only be-
lieve it, Christ is the victory on every point."—The Life of Victory, pages
102, 103.
    7. Of what may we be confident when Christ begins His work of grace
in our hearts? Phil. 1:6; 1 Thess. 5:24.

                            The Life of Victory
     8. To what is the new birth a prelude? John 10:10.
    NoTE.—"True faith and true prayer,--how strong they are ! They are as
two arms by which the human suppliant lays hold upon the power of Infinite
Love. Faith is trusting in God,—believing that He loves us, and knows what
is for our best good. Thus, instead of our own way, it leads us to choose His
way. In place of our ignorance, it accepts His wisdom; in place of our weak-
ness, His strength; in place of our sinfulness, His righteousness. Our lives,
ourselves, are already His; faith acknowledges His ownership, and accepts its
blessing. Truth, uprightness, purity, are pointed out as secrets of life's success.
It is faith that puts us in possession of these. Every good impulse or aspira-
tion is the gift of God; faith receives from God the life that alone can pro-
duce true growth and efficiency."—Gospel Workers, page 259.
    9. As we grow in grace from day to day, what character development
will be seen? Matt. 5:48; 1 John 5:4.
    NoTE.—"All true obedience comes from the heart. It was heart work with
 Christ. And if we consent, He will so identify Himself with our thoughts and
aims, so blend our hearts and minds into conformity to His will, that when
obeying Him we shall be but carrying out our own impulses. The will, refined
and sanctified, will find its highest delight in doing His service. When we know
God as it is our privilege to know Him, our life will be a life of continual
obedience. Through an appreciation of the character of Christ, through com-
munion with God, sin will become hateful to us."—The Desire of Ages, page
668.
    10. To how many may this life of victory become a reality? John 3:
16; Isa. 45:22.
    Nom—Victory is not for a favored few; it is for every child of God. Each
soul has the heritage of victory and he should claim this heritage. "Through
the right exercise of the will, an entire change may be made in your life. By
yielding up your will to Christ, you ally yourself with the power that
is above all principalities and powers. You will have strength from above to
hold you steadfast, and thus through constant surrender to God you will be
enabled to live the new life, even the life of faith."—Steps to Christ, page 52.

                                Consecration
    MEMORY VERSE: "If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself, and
take up his cross, and follow Me." Matt. 16:24.
    STUDY HELP: "Steps to Christ," chapter, "Consecration."
    THEME THOUGHT: "Consecrate yourself to God in the morning; make this
your very first work. Let your prayer be, 'Take me, 0 Lord, as wholly Thine. I lay
all my plans at Thy feet. Use me today in Thy service. Abide with me, and let all my
work be wrought in Thee.' This is a daily matter. Each morning consecrate yourself
to God for that day. Surrender all your plans to Him, to be carried out or given up as
His providence shall indicate. Thus day by day you may be giving your life into the
hands of God, and thus your life will be molded more and more after the life of Christ."
—"Steps to Christ," pages 74, 75.

                                   Lesson Brief
   Consecration is the surrender of the soul to God. It is the union, the one-
ness with heavenly forces. It is .characterized by prayer and feeding on the
word. It is a life that is humble but not weak, courageous but not hard, fixed
but not stubborn, meek but not vacillating, and sure but not proud. Conse-
cration is man's part in the reception of Christ's righteousness—it is sub-
mission to higher powers and greater forces.
                     Consecration Demands Our All
    1. What did Christ say was the first essential to discipleship? Matt.
16:24; Luke 14:33.
    NorE.—"Man must be emptied of self before he can be, in the fullest sense,
a believer in Jesus. When self is renounced, then the Lord can make man a
new creature. New bottles can contain the new wine. The love of Christ will
animate the believer with new life. In him who looks unto the Author and
Finisher of our faith, the character of Christ will be manifest."—The Desire of
Ages, page 280.
    2. How did Jesus set forth the supremacy of love to God? Matt. 10:
37; Luke 14:26.
    NOTE.—The original Greek from which "hateth" is translated is an old
and very strong verb meaning to hate, to detest. Dr. A. T. Robertson, in Word
Pictures in the New Testament, says:
    "The Orientals use strong language where cooler spirits would speak of pref-
erence or indifference. But even so Jesus does not here mean that one must
hate his father or mother of necessity or as such, for Matt. 15:4 proves the
opposite. It is only where the element of choice comes in (compare Matt.
6:24) as it sometimes does, when father or mother opposes Christ. Then one
must not hesitate."
    "God gave all for man, and He asks him to place His service above every
earthly and selfish consideration. He cannot accept a divided heart. The
 heart that is absorbed in earthly affections cannot be given up to God. The
 lesson is for all time. We are to follow the Lamb of God whithersoever He
 goeth. His guidance is to be chosen, His companionship valued, above the
 companionship of earthly friends. Christ says, 'He that loveth father or mother
 more than Me is not worthy of Me: and he that loveth son or daughter more
 than Me is not worthy of Me.' "---Christ's Object Lessens, page 223.
                                         1P1
                        Our Need of Consecration
     3. How forcefully does the apostle Paul state the need of entire con-
secration? Rom. 12:1; Gal. 5:24.
    NOTE.—"In that ancient ritual which was the gospel in symbol, no blem-
ished offering could be brought to God's altar. The sacrifice that was to rep-
 resent Christ must be spotless. The word of God points to this as an illustra-
tion of what His children are to be,—`a living sacrifice,' holy and without
blemish,' well pleasing to God.' "—The Ministry of Healing, page 130.
    4. How does the apostle further describe this consecration? Rom. 6:11;
Col. 3:2, 3.
    5. With what question did Christ seek to impress Peter with the lesson
of complete consecration? John 21:15.
    NoTE.—"Christ gave all for us, and those who receive Christ will be ready
to sacrifice all for the sake of their Redeemer. The thought of His honor and
glory will come before anything else.
    "If we love Jesus, we shall love to live for Him, to present our thank
offerings to Him, to labor for Him. The very labor will be light. For His
sake we shall covet pain and toil and sacrifice. We shall sympathize with His
longing for the salvation of men. We shall feel the same tender craving for
souls that He has felt."—Christ's Object Lessons, pages 49, 50.
    6. What may one who consecrates himself to Christ be called to do?
Matt. 6:24; 1 John 2:15.
    7. With whom will God dwell? Isa. 57:15; John 14:23.
    NOTE.—"The proud heart strives to earn salvation; but both our title to
heaven and our fitness for it are found in the righteousness of Christ. The
Lord can do nothing toward the recovery of man until, convinced of his own
weakness, and stripped of all self-sufficiency, he yields himself to the control
of God. Then he can receive the gift that God is waiting to bestow. From
the soul that feels his need, nothing is withheld. He has unrestricted access
to Him in whom all fullness dwells."—The Desire of Ages, page 300.
                         The Master Our Example
    8. What example in consecration did Christ set for us? John 6:38;
17:19.       ..
    NOTE.—"Jesus now explained to His disciples that His own life of self-
abnegation was an example of what theirs should be. Calling about Him,
with the disciples, the people who had been lingering near, He said, 'If any man
will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and
follow Me.' The cross was associated with the power of Rome. It was the
instrument of the most cruel and humiliating form of death. . . . But Jesus
bade His followers take up the cross and bear it after Him. To the disciples
His words, though dimly comprehended, pointed to their submission to the
most bitter humiliation,—submission even unto death for the sake of Christ.
No more complete self-surrender could the Saviour's words have pictured.
But all this He had accepted for them. Jesus did not count heaven a place to
be desired while we were lost. He left the heavenly courts for a life of re-
proach and insult, and a death of shame. He who was rich in heaven's price-
less--treasure, became poor, that through His poverty we might be rich. We
are to follow -in the path He trod."—The Desire of Ages, pages 416, 417.
                                     [ 20]
     9. In what measure will the power of Christ be operative in the life
of one who is wholly consecrated to God? Phil. 4:13; Eph. 3:16.
    NoTE.—"All who consecrate soul, body, and spirit to God, will be con-
stantly receiving a new endowment of physical and mental power. The in-
exhaustible supplies of heaven are at their command. Christ gives them the
breath of His own Spirit, the life of His own life. The Holy Spirit puts forth
its highest energies to work in heart and mind.           . Through co-operation
with Christ they are complete in Him, and in their human weakness they are
enabled to do the deeds of Omnipotence."—The Desire of Ages, page 827.
    10. What spirit of consecration should be manifest at this time? Heb.
10:35-39; 2 Peter 3:11, 12, 14.
    NOTE.—"The great work of the gospel is not to close with less manifesta-
tion of the power of God than marked its opening. The prophecies which
were fulfilled in the outpouring of the former rain at the opening of the gos-
pel, are again to be fulfilled in the latter rain at its close. Here are the times
of refreshing' to which the apostle Peter looked forward when he said, 'Repent
ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out when the
times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord; and He shall
send Jesus.'
    "Servants of God, with their faces lighted up and shining with holy con-
secration, will hasten from place to place to proclaim the message from heaven.
By thousands of voices, all over the earth, the warning will be given. Miracles
will be wrought, the sick will be healed, and signs and wonders will follow the
believers. . . . Thus the inhabitants of the earth will be brought to tak(
their stand."—The. Great Controversy, pages 611, 612.



                   Lesson 8, for November 22, 1941

         The Blessedness of Consecrated Service
    MEMORY VERSE: "As Thou hast sent Me into the world, even so have I also
sent them into the world." John 17:18.
    STUDY HELP: "The Sanctified Life," Mrs. E. G. White, pages 64-69.
    THEME THOUGHT: "It is the privilege of every soul to be a living channel
through which God can communicate to the world the treasures of His grace, the un-
searchable riches of Christ. There is nothing that Christ desires so much as agents who
will represent to the world His Spirit and character. There is nothing that the world
needs so much as the manifestation through humanity of the Saviour's love. All heaven
is waiting for channels through which can be poured the holy oil to be a joy and bless-
ing to human hearts."—"Christ's Object Lessons," page 419.

                               Lesson Brief
    There are many invitations in the Bible,—invitations to "come," "rest,"
"receive," "drink,"—but for all these there are just as emphatic exo rtations
to "go," "work," "witness," "make disciples." Jesus was among men "as He
that serveth." And the final rewards will not be given for professions made,
nor alone for victories won, nor yet entirely for a holy life. But they will be
given rather, because "I was an hungred, and ye gave Me meat: I was thirsty,
and ye gave Me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took Me in: naked, and ye
                                        [21 }
clothed Me: I was sick, and ye visited Me: I was in prison, and ye came unto
Me." Service—outflowing Christianity—is the great purpose for which we
follow after. It is the witness of our faith, the evidence of our discipleship.
"Ye are the salt of the earth," "the light of the world," the citizens of heaven,
and the ambassadors of God, working "together with God," for "he that saith
he abideth in Him ought himself also so to walk, even as He walked."

                          Sent Forth in Service
    1. What evidence is found in Scripture that Jesus recognized that He
was sent forth of God to fulfill a definite mission? John 12:49; 5:30; 4:34.
    2. How clearly is our mission in representing Christ to the world stated?
What similarities exist? John 17:18; 1 John 4:17 (last part); Matt. 28:
18-20; Acts 1:8.
    NOTE.—Christ was certain that He was sent of God into the world for a
definite work. We have equal grounds for certainty that we are sent of Christ
into the world for a definite work. How frequently and in how many ways has
the Lord emphasized this truth !
    "Not more surely is the place prepared for us in the heavenly mansions
than is the special place designated on earth where we are to work for God."
—Christ's Object Lessons, page 327.
    3. What assurance was connected with Christ's first call to disciple-
ship? Matt. 4:19; compare John 15:16.
    Norc.—"The Saviour's commission to the disciples included all the be-
lievers. It includes all believers in Christ to the end of time. It is a fatal
mistake to suppose that the work of saving souls depends alone on the or-
dained minister. All to whom the heavenly inspiration has come, are put in
trust with the gospel. All who receive the life of Christ are ordained to work
for the salvation of their fellow men. For this work the church was estab-
lished, and all who take upon themselves its sacred vows are thereby pledged
to be co-workers with Christ."—The Desire of Ages, page 822.
    4. How spontaneously and ardently did the first disciples and the early
church carry out this instruction? John 1:40, 41, 43-45; Acts 8:1-4.
    5. How keenly did the apostle Paul feel the burden of lost souls? Rom.
9:1-3; 1 Cor. 9:16, 22.
    NorE.—"At the gate of Damascus the vision of the Crucified One changed
the whole current of his [Paul's] life. The persecutor became a disciple, the
 teacher a learner. . . . His afterlife was inspired by the one principle of self-
sacrifice, the ministry of love."—Education, page 65.
                      Our Personal Responsibility
    6. In the work of saving souls, what is the measure of accountability?
Matt. 25:15, 19.
    NorE.—“Long has God waited for the spirit of service to take possession
of the whole church, so that everyone shall be working for Him according to
his ability. When the members of the church of God do their appointed work
in the needy fields at home and abroad, in fulfillment of the gospel commis-
sion, the whole world will soon be warned, and the Lord Jesus will return to
this earth with power and great glory."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 111.
                                    [22]
    7. What class of people is seen to be in greatest danger? Verses 24,
25, 30.
    NOTE.—"The Lord has a place for everyone in His great plan. Talents that
are not needed are not bestowed. Supposing that the talent is small. God has
a place for it, and that one talent, if faithfully used, will do the very work
God designs that it should do. The talents of the humble cottager are needed
in the house-to-house labor, and can accomplish more in this work than bril-
liant gifts.
    "A thousand doors of usefulness are open before us. We lament the scanty
resources at present available, while various and urgent demands are press-
ing us for means and men. Were we thoroughly in earnest, even now we could
multiply the resources a hundredfold. Selfishness and self-indulgence bar
the way."—Testimonies, vol. 9, pp. 37, 38.
    8. How continuously should we sow the seeds of truth? What should
urge us on? Ecel. 11:6; Isa. 32:20; 2 Cor. 5:20.
    NOTE.—"We must sow beside all waters, keeping our souls in the love of
God, working while it is day, and using the means the Lord has given us to do
whatever duty comes next. Whatever our hands find to do, we are to do it with
faithfulness; whatever sacrifice we are called upon to make, we are to make it
cheerfully. As we sow beside all waters, we shall realize that 'he which soweth
bountifully shall reap also bountifully.' "—Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 127.
                                                    •
                        The Promise of Reward
    9. What promise is made to those who thus sow the gospel seed amid all
circumstances and conditions? Ps. 126:5, 6.
   NorE.—"God's great covenant declares that 'while the earth remaineth,
seedtime and harvest . . . shall not cease.' In the confidence of this promise
the husbandman tills and sows. Not less confidently are we in the spiritual
sowing to labor, trusting His assurance, 'So shall My word be that goeth forth
out of My mouth; it shall not return unto Me void, but it shall accomplish
that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.' He
that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again
with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.' "—Christ's Object Lessons,
page 65.
    10. How are they commended? What is promised to all who win souls
for the kingdom of God? Prov. 11:30; Dan. 12:3.
   NoTE.—"One soul saved in the kingdom of God is of more value than all
earthly riches. We are answerable to God for the souls of those with whom
we are brought in contact, and the closer our connections with our fellow men,
the greater our responsibility."—Christian Experience and Teachings, pages
214, 215.
    11. What is to be the final fate of unfruitful Christians? John 15:2.
   12. What is the most powerful and most effective sermon that can be
preached? Matt. 5:16.
   NOTE.—"Men will believe, not what the minister preaches, but what the
church lives. Too often the influence of the sermon preached from the pulpit is
counteracted by the sermon preached in the lives of those who claim to be
advocates of truth.
                                     (23]
    "It is the purpose of God to glorify Himself in His people before the
world. He expects those who bear the name of Christ to represent Him in
thought, word, and deed. Their thoughts are to be pure and their words noble
and uplifting, drawing those around them nearer the Saviour. The religion of
Christ is to be interwoven with all that they do and say. Their every business
transaction is to be fragrant with the presence of God."—Testimonies, vol. 9,
p. 21.
    13. How only can the gospel work be finished? 1 Thess. 1:6-8.
    NoTE.—"The work of God in this earth can never be finished until the men
and women comprising our church membership rally to the work, and unite
their efforts with those of ministers and church officers."—Testimonies, vol. 9,
p. 117.
    14. Who especially are commended at the coming of the Master? Matt.
25:34-40.
    NoTE.—"My brethren and sisters, give yourselves to the Lord for service.
Allow no opportunity to pass unimproved. Visit the sick and suffering, and
show a kindly interest in them. If possible, do something to make them more
comfortable. Through this means you can reach their hearts, and speak a
word for Christ."—Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 36.


                   Lesson '9, for November 29, 1941
             The Word and Prayer in Victory
    MEMORY VERSE: "Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin
against Thee." Ps. 119:11.
    STUDY HELP: "Steps to Christ," chapter, "The Privilege of Prayer."
    THEME THOUGHT: "In the matchless gift of His Son, God has encircled the
whole world with an atmosphere of grace, as real as the air which circulates around
the globe. All who choose to breathe this life-giving atmosphere will live, and grow up
to the stature of men and women in Christ Jesus."—"Steps to Christ," page 72.
                                  Lesson Brief
    Vegetation cannot live without light; fish, without water; animals, without
food; nor Christians, without prayer and the study of the Bible. It.c words
are light, water, food, and more—they are power, life, victory. They are the
channel through which flow all spiritual blessings, the source of all power, the
storehouse of all wisdom, and the fountain of all life. He who lives with the
Bible lives with God; he who makes it his companion fellowships with the
Spirit; he who studies it daily as often partakes of Christ—His life, His power.
Through the Bible flow all Christian graces, all triumph, and all victory.
                      Power Available in the Word
    1. How was the word of God given? 2 Peter 1:21; 2 Tim. 3:16.
    NoTa.—"God has been pleased to communicate His truth to the world by
human agencies, and He Himself, by His Holy Spirit, qualified men and en-
abled them to do this work. He guided the mind in the selection of what to
speak and what to write. The treasure was entrusted to earthen vessels, yet it
is, none the less, frbm heaven. The testimony is conveyed through the im-
perfect expression of human language, yet it is the testimony of God; and the
                                          24
obedient, believing child of God beholds in it the glory of divine power, full
of grace and truth."—The Great Controversy, Introduction, pages vi, v11.
      2. What is the nature of the word of God? Heb. 4:12; John 6 : 63.
     NOTE.—"The life of God, which gives life to the world, is in His word. It
was by His word that Jesus healed disease and cast out demons. By His word
He stilled the sea and raised the dead; and the people bore witness that His
word was with power. He spoke the word of God as He had spoken it to all
the Old Testament writers. The whole Bible is a manifestation of Christ. It is
our only source of power."—Gospel Workers, page 250.
      3. What transforming power is contained in this word of God? 2 Peter
1:3, 4; Eph. 5:26; Ps. 119:9, 11, 130.
     NOTE.—"The Lord has often made manifest in His providence that nothing
less than revealed truth, the word of God, can reclaim man from sin or keep
him from transgression. That word which reveals the guilt of sin, has a power
upon the human heart to make man right and keep him so. The Lord has
said that His word is to be studied and obeyed; it is to be brought into the
practical life; that word is as inflexible as the character of God,—the same
yesterday, today, and forever."—Testimonies to Ministers, pages 80, 81.
      4. What is the word of God able to do? 2 Tim. 3:15.
     NOTE.—" 'If ye abide in Me,' He says, 'and My words abide in you, ye shall
ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.' It is through the word that
Christ abides in His followers. This is the same vital union that is represented
by eating His flesh and drinking His blood. The words of Christ are spirit and
life. Receiving them you receive the life of the Vine. You live 'by every word
that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.' The life of Christ in you produces
the same fruits as in Him. Living in Christ, adhering to Christ, supported by
Christ, drawing nourishment from Christ, you bear fruit after the similitude
of Christ."—The Desire of Ages, page 677.
      5. What is said of the spiritual necessity for the study of the word of
God? Matt. 4:4; Rom. 15:4; 1 Cor. 10:11.
     NoTE.—"The' life of Christ, that gives life to the world, is in His word.
. . . When His visible presence should be withdrawn, the word must be their
[His followers'] source of power. Like their Master, they were to live 'by
every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.' As our physical life
is sustained by food, so our spiritual life is sustained by the word of God. And
every soul is to receive life from God's word for himself."—The Desire of
Ages, page 390.
      6. What is especially declared regarding the prophetic word? 2 Peter
1:16-19; Rev. 1:1-3.
     NOTE.—"The Lord will bless all who will seek humbly and meekly to under-
stand that which is revealed in the Revelation. This book contains so much
that is large with immortality and full of glory that all who read and search
it earnestly receive the blessing to those 'that bear the words of this prophecy,
and keep those things which are written therein.' "—Testimonies to Min-
isters, page 114.
                        Prayer's Part in Victory
   7. What is prayer said to be?
   ANswER.—"Prayer is the opening of the heart to God as to a friend."—
                                 [ 25 ]
Steps to Christ, page 97. "Prayer is communion with God."—Testimonies,
vol. 7, p. 42. "Prayer is the cry of the soul to God."—The Life of Victory,
page 135. "Prayer is the key in the hand of faith to unlock heaven's store-
house."—Steps to Christ, page 99. "Prayer is the breath of the soul."—Gospel
Workers, page 254.
    8. What place was prayer to occupy in the life to which Jesus was in-
viting men? Luke 18:1.
    NOTE.—"There is no time or place in which it is inappropriate to offer up
a petition to God. There is nothing that can prevent us from lifting up our
hearts in the spirit of earnest prayer. In the crowds of the street, in the midst
of a business engagement, we may send up a petition to God, and plead for
divine guidance, as did Nehemiah when he made his request before King
Artaxerxes."—Steps to Christ, page 103.
    9. What should characterize our prayers? Eph. 6:18; Phil. 4:6.
    NoTE.—"Our prayers should be full of tenderness and love. When we yearn
for a deeper, broader realization of the Saviour's love, we shall cry to God
for more wisdom. If ever there was a need of soul-stirring prayers and ser-
mons, it is now. The end of all things is at hand. 0 that we could see as we
should the necessity of seeking the Lord with all the heart! Then we should
find Him."—Gospel Workers, page 177.
    10. Repeat some of God's promises to answer prayer. Ps. 91:15; Isa.
58:9; Luke 11:9; John 15:7.
    NoTE.—"Never a prayer is offered, however faltering, never a tear is shed,
however secret, never a sincere desire after God is cherished, however feeble,
but the Spirit of God goes forth to meet it. Even before the prayer is uttered,
or the yearning of the heart made known, grace from Christ goes forth to
meet the grace that is working upon the human soul."—Christ's Object Les-
sons, page 206.
    11. What model prayer did Jesus give us? Matt. 6:9-13.
   Nom—The Lord's Prayer is short but perfect. All things that men re-
quire are enfolded within its seven short petitions. It teaches the fatherhood
of God, the sonship of man, and the brotherhood of all races. It designates
God's dwelling place, His position, His power, His love. It proclaims Him the
Lifegiver, all-wise, all-powerful.
    12. What is especially enjoined at this time? Luke 21:36.


                   Lesson 10, for December 6, 1941

                           Spiritual Growth
    MEMORY VERSE: "Grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Sav-
iour Jesus Christ." 2 Peter 3:18.
    STUDY HELPS: "Steps to Christ," chapter, "Growing Up Into Christ:" "The
Acts of the Apostles," pages 309-315.
    THEME THOUGHT: "As the flower turns to the sun, that the bright beams may
aid in perfecting its beauty and symmetry, so should we turn to the Sun of Righteous-
ness, that heaven's light may shine upon us, that mir 9116r99ter may be developed in
the likeness of Christ."—"Steps to Christ," page 73.

                                Lesson Brief
    Growth is an evidence of life. Salvation once known, spiritual life once
begun, victory once experienced, and sonship once enjoyed, is no guarantee of
final triumph. It is only as we grow, expand, advance, ever perceiving new
truths, knowing new aspirations, finding new inspirations, climbing greater
heights in Christian experience, submitting to new baptisms of the Spirit and
claiming greater victories in Christ that we continue in grace and salvation.
And as we compare ourselves with Christ, the faultless pattern, how urgent
seems the admonition to "grow up into Him in all things."
                       Christian Life Is Growth
    1. How did Christ illustrate Christian growth? Mark 4:26-29.
    NorE.—"The germination of the seed represents the beginning of spiritual
life, and the development of the plant is a beautiful figure of Christian growth.
As in nature, so in grace ; there can be no life without growth. The plant
must either grow or die. As its growth is silent and imperceptible, but con-
tinuous, so is the development of the Christian life. At every stage of de-
velopment our life may be perfect; yet if God's purpose for us is fulfilled,
there will be continual advancement. Sanctification is the work of a lifetime.
As our opportunities multiply, our experience will enlarge, and our knowledge
increase. We shall become strong to bear responsibility, and our maturity will
be in proportion to our privileges."—Christ's Object Lessons, pages 65, 66.
     2. What admonition to growth is given through Peter the apostle?
2 Peter 3:18.
    Nora.—"Whenever the people of God are growing in grace, they will be
constantly obtaining a clearer understanding of His word. They will discern
new light and beauty in its sacred truths. This has been true in the history
of the church in all ages, and thus it will continue to the end"—Gospel
Workers, page 297.
     3. How does the apostle Paul express God's purpose for His church?
Eph. 4:14, 15.
     4. How did he exemplify this purpose in his own life? Phil. 3:13, 14.
    NOTE.—"Paul's was a life of intense and varied activities. From city to
city, from country to country, he journeyed, telling the story •of the cross,
winning converts to the gospel, and establishing churches. For these churches
he had a constant care, and he wrote many letters of instruction to them. At
times he worked at his trade to earn his daily bread. But in all the busy
activity of his life, he never lost sight of the one great purpose,—to press to-
ward the mark of his high calling."—Gospel Workers, pages 58, 59.
     5. What experience among the Colossian believers pleased Paul? _Col.
1:7-10.
    Nors.—"Thus Paul put into words his desire for the Colossian believers.
How high the ideal that these words hold before the follower of Christ They
show the wonderful possibilities of the Christian life, and make it plain that
 there is no limit to the blessings that the children of God may receive. Con-
stantly increasing in a knowledge of God, they may go on from strength to
strength, from height to height in Christian experience, until by 'His glorious
 power' they are made 'meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in
 light.' "—The Acts of the Apostles, page 471.

    6. What stages of growth are to appear in the life of the Christian?
2 Peter 1:4-8.
    7. Even when we age or become physically weak, what should be our
spiritual experience? 2 Cor. 4:16.
                             The Means to Growth
    8. What does the Christian recognize as an effective means of spiritual
growth? 1 Peter 2:2; John 6:33, 63.
    9. What effect does the Holy Spirit have upon the life? Gal. 5:22.
   NOTE.—"As you receive the Spirit of Christ,—the spirit of unselfish love
and labor for others,—you will grow and bring forth fruit. The graces of
the Spirit will ripen in your character. Your faith will increase, your con-
victions deepen, your love be made perfect. More and more you will reflect
the likeness of Christ in all that is pure, noble, and lovely."—Christ's Object
Lessons, page 68.
    10. What illustration does the apostle give of attainment in the Chris-
tian life? 1 Cor. 9:24-27.
                          The Ultimate Goal
    11. In spiritual growth, what goal is held before us? Matt. 5:48.
    NoTE.—"God desires us to reach the standard of perfection made possible
for us by the gift of Christ. He calls upon us to make our choice on the right
side, to connect with heavenly agencies, to adopt principles that will restore
in us the divine image."—The Ministry of Healing, page 114.


                   Lesson 11, for December 13, 1941
                                Sanctification
    MEMORY VERSE: "Sanctify them through Thy truth: Thy word is truth."
John 17:17.
    STUDY HELPS: "The Acts of the Apostles," pages 557-567; "The Great Con-
troversy," pages 469, 470 (new ed., pages 534-536).
    THEME THOUGHT: "Sanctification is the work, not of a day, or of a year, but
of a lifetime. The struggle for conquest over self, for holiness and heaven, is a lifelong
struggle."—"Testimonies," vol. 8, pp. 312, 313.

                                    Lesson Brief
     Through the purpose of Christ and by divine aid we choose life unto obe-
dience, we receive the Spirit and submit to His leadership, we accept right-
eousness, experience consecration, engage in service, know fellowship with the
word, and grow in grace. All these things urge us forward in the way of sanc-
tification toward "holiness unto the Lord." Sanctification is a path, the end
of which is perfection—not relative perfection, not human perfection; but
Christ-given and God-wrought perfection; a perfection that is free from sin
—clean, pure, glorious, "not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but
. . . holy and without blemish." Such will be every child of God upon whom
He places His seal and who shall be "without fault before the throne of God,"
"at His appearing and His kingdom."
                                         [28   ]
                    The Meaning of Sanctification
     1. What is God's will for His people called? 1 Thess. 4:1-7.
     Nova.—" 'This is the will of God,' the apostle Paul wrote, 'even your
sanctification.' The sanctification of the church is God's object in all His
 dealings with His people. He has chosen them from eternity, that they might be
 holy. He gave His Son to die for them, that they might be sanctified through
 obedience to the truth, divested of all the littleness of self. From them He
 requires a personal work, a personal surrender. God can be honored by those
 who profess to believe in Him, only as they are conformed to His image and
 controlled by His Spirit. Then, as witnesses for the Saviour, they may make
 known what divine grace has done for them."—The Acts of the Apostles, page
559.
     2. What experience had come to the Corinthian believers? 1 Cor. 6:11.
     Nora.—"In the life of the disciple John true •sanctification is exemplified.
 During the years of his close association with Christ, he was often warned and
 cautioned by the Saviour; and these reproofs he accepted. As the character of
 the Divine One was manifested to him, John saw his own deficiencies, and was
 humbled by the revelation. Day by day, in contrast with his own violent
 spirit, he beheld the tenderness and forbearance of Jesus, and heard His lessons
 of humility and patience. Day by day his heart was drawn out to Christ, until
 he lost sight of self in love for his Master. The power and tenderness, the
 majesty and meekness, the strength and patience, that he saw in the daily life
 of the Son of God, filled his soul with admiration. He yielded his resentful,
 ambitious temper to the molding power of Christ, and divine love wrought in
 him a transformation of character."
     "Sanctification is not the work of a moment, an hour, a day, but of a
 lifetime. It is not gained by a happy flight of feeling, but is the result of con-
 stantly dying to sin, and constantly living for Christ. Wrongs cannot be righted
 nor reformations wrought in the character by feeble, intermittent efforts. It
 is only by long, persevering effort, sore discipline, and stern conflict, that we
 shall overcome. We know not one day how strong will be our conflict the
 next. So long as Satan reigns, we shall have self to subdue, besetting sins
 to overcome; so long as life shall last, there will be no stopping place, no point
 which we can reach and say, I have fully attained. Sanctification is the result
 of lifelong obedience."—The Acts of the Apostles, pages 557, 560.
      3. How is this 'sanctification made available? 1 Cor. 1:30.
      Nora.—"True sanctification comes through the working out of the prin-
  ciple of love. 'God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth.in God, and
, God in him.' The life of him in whose heart Christ abides, will reveal
  practical godliness. The character will be purified, elevated, ennobled, and
 glorified. Pure doctrine will blend with works of righteousness; heavenly pre-
  cepts will mingle with holy practices.
     "Those who would gain the blesting of sanctification must first learn the
  meaning of self-sacrifice. The cross of Christ is the central pillar on which
  hangs the 'far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.' If any man will
  come after Me,' Christ says, 'let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and
  follow Me' It is the fragrance of our love for our fellow men that reveals our
 love for God. It is patience in service that brings rest to the soul. It is
  through, humble, diligent, faithful toil that the welfare of Israel is promoted.
  God upholds and strengthens the one who is willing to follow in Christ's
  way. . . .
                                          29
    "The nearer we come to Jesus, and the more clearly we discern the purity
of His character, the more clearly shall we see the exceeding sinfulness of sin,
and the less shall we feel like exalting ourselves. There will be a continual
reaching out of the soul after God, a continual, earnest, heartbreaking con-
fession of sin and humbling of the heart before Him. At every advance step in
our Christian experience, our repentance will deepen. We shall know that our
sufficiency is in Christ alone, and shall make the apostle's confession our own:
`I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing.' God for-
bid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom
the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.'"—The Acts of the Apos-
tles, pages 560, 561.
                    The Agencies of Sanctification
     4. Through what are we cleansed and sanctified? Heb. 13:12; 9:22;
1 John 1:7.
    NOTE.—"We may have flattered ourselves, as did Nicodemus, that our life
has been upright, that our moral character is correct, and think that we need
not humble the heart before God, like the common sinner: but when the light
from Christ shines into our souls, we shall see how impure we are; we shall
discern the selfishness of motive, the enmity against God, that has defiled every
act of life. Then we shall know that our own righteousness is indeed as filthy
rags, and that the blood of Christ alone can cleanse us from the defilement of
sin, and renew our hearts in His own likeness."—Steps to Christ, pages 32, 33.
    5. What other agencies are operative in sanctification? John 17:17;
Rom. 15:16.
    NorE.—"True sanctification is a Bible doctrine. The apostle Paul, in his
letter to the Thessalonian church, declares, 'This is the will of God, even your
sanctification.' And he prays, 'The very God of peace sanctify you wholly.'
The Bible clearly teaches what sanctification is, and how it is to be attained.
The Saviour prayed for His disciples, 'Sanctify them through Thy truth: Thy
word is truth.' And Paul teaches that believers are to be 'sanctified by the
Holy Ghost.' . . . The followers of Christ are to become like Him,—by the
grace of God to form characters in harmony with the principles of His holy
law. This is Bible sanctification."—The Great Controversy, page 469.

               The Results and Sign of Sanctification
    6. From what will a true condition of sanctification free the Christian?
Rom. 6:2, 12, 14; 8:1-4.
    NOTE.—"Bible sanctification does not consist in strong emotion. Here is
where many are led into error. They make feelings their criterion. When they
feel elated or happy, they claim that they are sanctified. Happy feelings or
the absence of joy is no evidence that a person is or is not sanctified. There
is no such thing as instantaneous sanctification. True sanctification is a daily
work, continuing as long as life shall last. Those who are battling with daily
temptations, overcoming their own sinful tendencies, and seeking for holiness
of heart and life, make no boastful claims of holiness. They are hungering
and thirsting for righteousness. Sin appears to them exceedingly sinful. . .
Self-denial, self-sacrifice, benevolence, kindness, love, patience, fortitude, and
Christian trust are the daily fruits borne by those who are truly connected
with God."—The Sanctified Life, pages 9, 10.
                                      (10)
    7. How definitely is the truth of sanctification taught in the apostolic
writings? 1 Peter 5:10; Col. 1:28, 29; Heb. 13:20, 21.
    8. How inclusive is this sanctification? 1 Thess. 5:23.
    Nom.—"The sanctification set forth in the Scriptures embraces the entire
being,—spirit, soul, and body. Paul prayed for the Thessalonians, that their
`whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our
Lord Jesus Christ.'"—The Great Controversy, page 473.
    9. What has God chosen as His special sign of sanctification? Ex.
31:13; Ezek. 20:12.
    NOTE.—"From the pillar of cloud Christ declared concerning the Sabbath,
`Verily My Sabbaths ye shall keep ; for it is a sign between Me and you through-
out your generations; that ye may know that I am the Lord that doth sanc-
tify you.' The Sabbath given to the world as the sign of. God as the Creator
is also the sign of Him as the Sanctifier. The power that created all things
is the power that re-creates the soul in His own likeness. To those who keep
holy the Sabbath day it is the sign of sanctification. True sanctification is
harmony with God, oneness with Him in character. It is received through
obedience to those principles that are the transcript of His character. And
the Sabbath is the sign of obedience. He who from the heart obeys the fourth
commandment will obey the whole law. He is sanctified through obedience."—
Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 350.
    10. At Christ's second appearing, how complete will have been the work
of sanctification in the lives of those whom He receives unto Himself? Eph.
5:26, 27; Rev. 14:1-5.
    NorE.—"We believe without a doubt that Christ is soon coming. This is
not a fable to us; it is a reality. We have no doubt, neither have we had a
doubt for years, that the docirines we hold today are present truth, and that
we are nearing the judgment. We are preparing to meet Him who, escorted by
a retinue of holy angels, is to appear in the clouds of heaven to give the faith-
ful and the just the finishing touch of immortality. When He comes, He is
not to cleanse us of our sins, to remove from us the defects in our characters,
or to cure us of the infirmities of our tempers and dispositions. If wrought
for us at all, this work will all be accomplished before that time. When the
Lord comes, those who are holy will be holy still. . . . But those who are
unjust, unsanctified, and filthy, will remain so forever."—Testimonies, vol. 2,
p. 355.


   "We cannot expect to gain spiritual knowledge without earnest toil. Those
who desire to find the treasures of truth must dig for them as the miner digs
for the treasure hidden in the earth. No halfhearted, indifferent work will
avail. It is essential for old and young, not only to read God's word, but to
study it with wholehearted earnestness, praying and searching for truth as
for hidden treasure. Those who do this will be rewarded; for Christ will
quicken the understanding.... .
   "Search, 0 search the precious Bible with hungry hearts. Explore God's
word as the miner explores' the earth to find veins of gold. Never give up the
search until you have ascertained your relation to God and His will in regard
to you."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 111.

                   Lesson 12, for December 20, 1941

       Confidence and Assurance Unto Victory
    MEMORY VERSE: "The just shall live by faith: but,if any man draw back, My
soul shall have no pleasure in him." Heb. 10:38.
    STUDY HELPS: "Testimonies," vol. 2, pp. 594-597; "The Great Controversy,"
pages 616-621 (new ed., pages 697-702).
    THEME THOUGHT: "The season of distress and anguish before us will require
a faith that can endure weariness, delay, and hunger,—a faith that will not faint, though
severely tried."—"The Great Controversy," page 621.

                                Lesson Brief
   The history of God's people from ancient times gives us to understand that
confidence and trust have ever brought victory. Belief in God, in His plans and
purposes, in His chosen leaders, and in the certainty of "present truth," has
worked miracles: It is imperative today that God's people maintain faith
unto victory. The power of God will be manifest in finishing His work, in
perfecting the saints, and in translating them.

                Waiting in Faith and Confidence
  1. What are God's people, when waiting for their Lord's return, ad-
monished not to do? Heb. 10:35-37.
    2. What does the gospel prophet say of the outworking of confidence?
Isa. 30:15.
    NoTE.—"A life in Christ is a life of restfulness. There may be no ecstasy
of feeling, but there should be an abiding, peaceful trust. Your hope is not in
yourself; it is in Christ. Your weakness is united to His strength, your igno-
rance to His wisdom, your frailty to His enduring might. So you are not to look
to yourself, not to let the mind dwell on self, but look to Christ. Let the
mind dwell upon His love, upon the beauty, the perfection, of His character.
Christ in His self-denial, Christ in His humiliation, Christ in His purity and
holiness, Christ in His matchless love,—this is the subject for the soul's con-
templation. It is by loving Him, copying Him, depending wholly upon Him,
that you are to be transformed into His likeness."—Steps to Christ, page 75.
     3. In what way did John the Baptist and the Saviour express their sure
confidence in their divine call? John 1:23; Luke 4:16-21.
     4. In what prophetic messages outlining our work may we have similar
confidence? Rev. 7:1-4; 14:6, 7.
     N0TE.—"We are living in times full of importance to each one. Light is
shining in clear, steady rays around us. If this light is rightly received and
appreciated, it will be a blessing to us and to others; but if we trust in our
own wisdom and strength, or in the wisdom and strength of our fellow men, it
will be turned into a poison. In the struggle for eternal life, we cannot lean upon
one another. The bread of life must be eaten by each one. Individually we must
partake of it, that soul, body, and mind may be revived and strengthened by
its transforming power, thus becoming assimilated to the mind and character
of Jesus Christ. God must be made first and last and best in everything."—
Testimonies to Ministers, page 385.
                                        ( 32 )
                      The Source of Trust in God
      5. What wonderful provision has God made that Christian stability be
  maintained? 2 Chron. 20:20.
      6. At this very time, just preceding His appearing, what will be the ex-
. perience of God's people? Heb. 10:38.
      NorE.—"It is not enough to believe about Christ; we must believe in. Him.
  The only faith that will benefit us is that which embraces Him as a personal
  Saviour; which appropriates His merits to ourselves. Many hold faith as an
  opinion. But saving faith is a transaction, by which those who receive Christ
  join themselves in covenant relation with God. Genuine faith is life. A living
  faith means an increase of vigor, a confiding trust, by which the soul becomes
  a conquering power."—Gospel Workers, page 261.
      7. In what way is saving grace received? Eph. 2:8.
      NorE.—"True faith and true prayer—how strong they are They are as
  two arms by which the human suppliant lays hold upon the power of Infinite
  Love. Faith is trusting in God,—belie'ving that He loves us, and knows what is
  for our best good. Thus, instead of our own way, it leads us to choose His way.
  In place of our ignorance, it accepts His wisdom; in place of our weakness,
  His strength; in place of our sinfulness, His righteousness."—Gospel Workers,
  page 259.
      When John G. Paton, that godly missionary, was in the New Hebrides,
  his greatest task was the translating of the Bible into the native language. The
  word "faith" held up his work for a long time. There just seemed to be no
  equivalent for faith in the language. Finally one day an islander sank into
  one of Paton's easy chairs after a strenuous day, remarking, "How restful it
  is to just cast all my weight upon this chair." The Holy Spirit seemed to say
  to Paton, "There is you- phrase for faith." Thus Paton's Bible read, "This is
  the victory that overcometh the world, even by casting all our weight upon
  Him." "God so loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son, that
  whosoever casteth all his weight upon Him should not perish, but have ever-
  lasting life."
              The Source of Faith and Faith's Fruitage
    8. From what source may our faith be increased? Rom. 10:17.
    NOTE.—"'Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall
 never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of
 water springing up into everlasting life.' This water represents the life of
 Christ, and every soul must have it by coming into living connection with God.
 Then blessed, humble, grateful confidence will be an abiding principle in the
 soul. Unbelieving fear will be swept away before living faith."—Testimonies to
 Ministers, page 226.
     9. Of what is faith declared to be the fruit? Gal. 5:22.
     10. What relation has faith sustained to the triumphs of God's people
 in all ages? Hebrews 11; Ps. 37:39, 40.
     11. How is the final victory to be gained? 1 John 5:4; Heb. 3:6.
     12. In what experience is Enoch a type of God's people in their crown-
 ing victory? Heb. 11:5.
    NorE.—It is very evident that at Christ's appearing God's people will be
                                      1331
translated in the same manner as was Enoch. They will look forward to trans-
lation; they will live for translation. The story of the cords let down, told in
volume 2, of the Testimonies, pages 594-597, to swing believers across the
final chasm, would indicate that the last act of this life is an act of faith.
The people of God shall be translated by faith.



                   Lesson 13, for December 27, 1941
                      God's Purpose Fulfilled
    MEMORY VERSE: "The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some men
:ount slackness; but is long-suffering to usward, not willing that any should perish,
but that all should come to repentance." 2 Peter 3:9.
    STUDY HELP: "The Great Controversy," pages 675-678 (new ed., pages 758-
762).
    THEME THOUGHT: "The great controversy is ended. Sin and sinners are no
more. The entire universe is clean. One pulse of harmony and gladness beats through
the vast creation. From Him who created all, Row life and light and gladness, through-
out the realms of illimitable space. From the minutest atom to the greatest world, all
things, animate and inanimate, in their unshadowed beauty and perfect joy, declare
that God is love."—"The Great Controversy," page 678.

                                  LessOn Brief
    The love and power of God, the sacrifice and understanding of Jesus, the
presence and help of the Spirit, the concern and watchcare of angels, together
with all the resources of heaven—all these things are placed at man's disposal
for the accomplishment of a single, noble, and glorious purpose—the ushering
in of a clean universe, the restoration of the authority of God, and the reign
of love; where "there shall be no more curse," and where even "death is
swallowed up in victory." Then "the kingdom and dominion, and the great-
ness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of
the saints of the Most High" and "God Himself shall be with them, and be
their God."
                       Sin Mars a Perfect Creation
    1. What was God's purpose in the creation of the world? Isa. 45:18.
    NoTE.—"God created the earth to be the abode of holy, happy beings. The
Lord 'formed the earth and made it; He bath established it, He created it not
in vain, He formed it to be inhabited.' That purpose will be fulfilled, when,
renewed by the power of God, and freed from sin and sorrow, it shall become
the eternal abode of the redeemed. 'The righteous shall inherit the land,
and dwell therein forever.' And there shall be no more curse; but the throne
of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and His servants shall serve Him.'"—
Patriarchs and Prophets, page 67.
    2. What was to be the character of earth's inhabitants? Gen. 1:26;
Eccl. 7:29.
    NoTE.—"Man was to bear God's image, both in outward resemblance and in
character. Christ alone is 'the express image' of the Father; but man was
formed in the likeness of God. His nature was in harmony with the will of
God. His mind was capable of comprehending divine things. His affections
were pure; his appetites and passions were under the control of reason. He
                                       [34 }
was holy and happy in bearing the image of God, and in perfect obedience to
His will."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 45.
   3. How was God's plan marred? Rom. 5:12; 1 Cor. 15:21, 22.
                The First Dominion to Be Restored
   4. What is said of the fulfillment of God's original purpose? Isa. 11:9;
Micah 4:8.
   5. What divine plan was laid for the redemption of lost man? John
3:16; 1 John 3:5, 8; Heb. 2:14.
   NorE.—"The great plan of redemption results in fully bringing back the
world into God's favor. All that was lost by sin is restored. Not only man
but the earth is redeemed, to be the eternal abode of the obedient. For six
thousand years, Satan has struggled to maintain possession of the earth. Now
God's original purpose in its creation is accomplished. 'The saints of the
Most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom forever, even
forever and ever.' "—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 342.
    6. What will be done finally with the sin-cursed earth? 2 Peter 3:10, 13.
     7. How are the last traces of sin to be removed? Matt. 25:41; Ps. 37:
20; Mal. 4:1.
    NoTE.—"This is not an act of arbitrary power on the part of God. The
rejecters of His mercy reap that which they have sown. God is the fountain of
life ; and when one chooses the service of sin, he separates from God, and thus
cuts himself off from life. He is 'alienated from the life of God.' Christ says,
`All they that hate Me love death.' God gives them existence for a time that
they may develop their character and reveal their principles. This accom-
plished, they receive the results of their own choice. By a life of rebellion,
Satan and all who unite with him place themselves so out of harmony with God
that His very presence is to them a consuming fire. The glory of Him who is
love will destroy them."—The Desire of Ages, pages 763, 764.

             Christ's Advent the Hope of Redemption
    8. Show that we may know when Christ's coming is near. Matt. 24:3-
13, 21, 29; Mark 13:24, 25; Luke 21:25-28; 2 Tim. 3:1-5.
    9. In what sign should we be most interested? Matt. 24:14, 44.
    NOTE.—The General Conference statistical report of the world-wide work
of Seventh-day Adventists for the year 1939 shows that their work was being
conducted in 404 countries, islands, and island groups, by 28,900 evangelistic
and institutional workers, who were using 820 languages and dialects. The rapid
progress of the work is indicated by the addition of 242 new languages and dia-
lects during the four years ending with the report, or an average of one new
language every six days. The report revealed an increase of 15.06 per cent in
membership since the report presented at the 1936 General Conference. The
statistical secretary sums up the report with this stirring comparison: "Let us
compare some of the main items as they were reported in 1910 with what they
were in 1939, a period of 29 years. Looking at the growth in this way you will
get a better idea of the increase that has been made. The total workers em-
ployed in 1910 were 8,264 ; in 1939, 28,900. In 1910 there were 71 languages used
in speaking this blessed hope; in 1939, 820. The countries and islands entered in
1910 were 83 ; in 1939, 404. The membership of our 2,769 churches in 1910
                                      ( 36 1
was 90,808; in 1939 there were 8,761 churches, with a membership of 486,670,
a net gain of 395,862 during the 29 years, or an average annual net gain of
13,650 members. Our total funds for all lines of evangelistic work in 1910
were $2,223,767.52; in 1939, $13,499,973.10—the largest amount ever con-
tributed during any year. The number of Sabbath schools in 1910 was 4,151,
with 101,161 pupils; in 1939, 14,010 schools, with 611,123 pupils. In 1910
there were 594 primary schools, 86 advanced schools, with 20,526 enrollment;
in 1939 there were 2,511 primary Schools, 252 advanced schools, with a total
enrollment of 116,706, or one student for every 4.17 church members."
    10. What loving entreaties does God send to His people? Heb. 3:12-14;
2 Peter 3:14-18; 1 Cor. 1:4-8.
    11. How are God's people sustained through their final trials? John
14:1-3; Titus 2:13; Isa. 43:1, 2.
    NOTE.—"As in the days of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, so in the
closing period of earth's history the Lord will work mightily in behalf of those
who stand steadfastly for the right. He who walked with the Hebrew worthies
in the fiery furnace will be with His followers wherever they are. His abiding
presence will comfort and sustain. In the midst of the time of trouble,—trouble
such as has not been since there was a nation,—His chosen ones will stand
unmoved. Satan with all the hosts of evil cannot destroy the weakest of God's
saints. Angels that excel in strength will protect them, and in their behalf
Jehovah will reveal Himself as a 'God of gods,' able to save to the uttermost
those who have put their trust in Him."—Prophets and Kings, page 513.
                         The Eternal Heritage
    12. Where is to be the eternal home of God's triumphant people? Ps.
37:9-11; Rev. 21:1-7.
    NoTE.—The Bible teaches that the first thousand years of eternity will
be passed by the saints of God in heaven. Rev. 20:4. Following this thou-
sand-year period the New Jerusalem comes down to this earth (Rev. 21:2),
the wicked are raised to life to meet their final judgment and destruction
(Rev. 20:7-14), and the fire which accomplishes this work spreads over the
entire earth rand purifies it. Then the earth becomes the eternal abode of the
ransomed of God. Here too, will be the throne of God and of Christ. Thus
while the saints of God may be said to enter upon their rewards at the coming
of Jesus, it necessarily follows that the entire possession of the kingdom will
take place a thousand years later.
    13. What is said of the glories of the new earth? Isa..65:17-19, 21-25;
11:6-9; 33:24; Rev. 22:1-7.
    NoTE.—"There, immortal minds will contemplate with never-failing de-
light the wonders of creative power, the mysteries of redeeming love. There
will be no cruel, deceiving foe to tempt to forgetfulness of God. Every faculty
will be developed, every capacity increased. The acquirement of knowledge
will not weary the mind or exhaust the energies. There the grandest enter-
prises may be carried forward, the loftiest aspirations reached, the highest am-
bitions realized; and still there will arise new heights to surmount, new won-
ders to admire, new truths to comprehend, fresh objects to call forth the
powers of mind and soul and body."—The Great Controversy, page 677.
    14. What gracious invitation to share this glory is extended freely to
a perishing world? Matt. 11:28-30; Rev. 22:17, 20, 21.

                 articles in the "Sabbath School Worker."

Teaching           The princiPal volume will be "A Work-
                 man Not Ashamed," by Mary Hunter Moore.
                 This book in eight chapters deals very effi-
Up to Bate       ciently with the teacher's day-by-day prep-
                 aration for the teaching of the Sabbath
                 school lesson. Miss Moore has written an
                 outstandingly helpful volume for the
                 teacher. Those who had the privilege of
                 reading her book, "They That Be Teachers,"
                 will welcome this additional contribution on
                 the teacher's work. Ordered alone, the price
                 will be 50 cents in paper covers.

                 will be "The Spirit of the Teacher," by Mrs.
                 L. Flora Plummer. This volume was in the
                 Reading Course in 1936. More than three
                 thousand have been circulated, but many
                 thousands more should be in the hands of
                 Sabbath school officers and teachers. The
                 retail price of "The Spirit of the Teacher" is
                 $1.25 postpaid.

                 during the time of the 1942 Reading Course
                 for $1.35, a saving of 40 cents on the com-
                 bination.

               THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
                        December 27
    A number of years ago an old chief in Nyasaland appealed for a teacher, but there
was no money. Years later he came again, saying: "Many of my people have died
since I asked for a teacher. How many more must die before you send us a teacher?"
The Thirteenth Sabbath overflow will go toward the establishment of a mission sta-
tion in the Kasungu area of Nyasaland, and another in Zululand.
    In 1939, when our Sabbath schools gave to this division, the overflow of $6,813.44
provided a new home for a doctor at the Maun Medical Mission in Bechuanaland,
helped to erect a new hospital building at Kanye Medical Mission in South Bechuana-
land, and helped the Helderberg College to erect a new music studio. These worthy
projects have been a great blessing.
    As our Sabbath school members give "as God hath prospered" them on December
27, may it be a liberal offering for the establishment of mission stations for Zululand
and for Nyasaland!
