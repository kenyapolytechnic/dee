           THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES—III
         (From Paul's Third Missionary Journey to His
                    Martyrdom in Rome)


                      Lesson 1, for April 5, 1941
    Paul's Third Missionary Journey; Paul and
                Apollos at Ephesus
   SCRIPTURE: Acts 18:23 to 19:20.
   MEMORY VERSE: "Fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was
magnified. And many that believed came, and , confessed, and showed their deeds."
Acts 10:17, last part; 18.
   STUDY HELP: "The Acts of the Apostles," pp. 276-290.
   PLACES: Galatia; Phrygia; Corinth; Ephesus.
   PERSONS: Paul; Apollos; Aquila and Priscilla; twelve men upon whom the Holy
Spirit came; Tyrannus ; many sick; vagabond Jews; seven sons of Sceva; Jews and
Greeks at Ephesus.
                           Setting of the Lesson
   In this lesson we begin a study of Paul's third missionary journey, which
covered a period of about four years. Antioch in Pisidia, and Iconium, Lystra,
and Derbe in Galatia were places with which we have.become familiar in these
studies, and were no doubt revisited by the apostle on this tour. In returning
to Ephesus, Paul kept the promise previously made. Acts 18:19-21. Ephesus
was a prominent center in Asia.
         The Third Missionary Journey Begun—Apollos
                       Preaches Christ
   1. Leaving Antioch in Syria, what provinces did Paul visit in beginning
his third missionary journey? Acts 18:23.
   NOTE.—Antioch will be remembered as the scene of Paul's first labors in
the gospel, his ordination, and the place to which he returned after each of
his former missionary trips.
    2. Who preceded Paul in reaching the city of Ephesus? Where was he
born? What is said of this Jew? How much of the gospel did he know?
Verses 24, 25.
   NOTE.—Apollos "had heard the preaching of John the Baptist, had received
the baptism of repentance, and was a living witness that the work of the
prophet had not been in vain."—The, Acts of the Apostles, page 269.
Sabbath School Lesson Quarterly, No. 184. April, 1941. 20 cents a year. Published
in the U. S. A. by Pacific Press Publishing Association (a corporation of S. D. A.),
Mountain View, California. Entered as second-class matter Oct. 13, 1904, at the
post office in Mountain View, California, under the Act of Congress of March 3, 1879.
Acceptance for mailing at special rate of postage provided- for in section 1103, Act

                                        [3)
   3. How did Apollos gain a fuller knowledge of the gospel message?
Verse 26.
   NorE.—Apollos, although a believer in Jesus, apparently was little ac-
quainted with the later life of the Saviour. He had not been fully instructed
concerning Christ's death, resurrection, and ascension, and knew not of Pente-
cost and the gift of the Holy Spirit. "He must have been a humble-minded
and noble soul, for after bold and impressive public teaching he allowed two
poor tentmakers to show him his ignorance and to tell him the full truth con-
cerning Christ."—Charles R. Erdman.
   4. What further help did Apollos receive? What was he then able
to do? Verses 27, 28.
   NOTE.—It is interesting to note in this connection how Paul later, in writ-
ing to the Corinthians, rebuked the spirit of partisanship. See 1 Cor.1:12, 13;
3:21-23. As this spirit is not unknown in the church today, we would do well
to heed the following instruction:
   "He who sends forth gospel workers as His ambassadors is dishonored when
there is manifested among the hearers so strong an attachment to some fa-
vorite minister that there is an unwillingness to accept the labors of some other
teacher. The Lord sends help 10. His people, not always as they may choose,
but as they need; for men are shortsighted, and cannot discern what is for
their highest good. It is seldom that one minister has all the qualifications
necessary to perfect a church in all the requirements of Christianity; therefore
God often sends to them other ministers, each possessing some qualifications in
which the others were deficient.
   "The church should gratefully accept these servants of Christ, even as they
would accept the Master Himself. They should seek to derive all the benefit
possible from the instruction which each minister may give them from the
word of God. The truths that the servants of God bring are to be accepted
and appreciated in the meekness of humility, but no minister is to be idolized."
—The Acts of the Apostles, pages 277, 278.

                             Paul in Ephesus
  5. While Apollos was at Corinth, to what city did Paul come? Of what
were certain disciples unaware? Acts 19:1, 2.
   6. Upon whom should those now believe who had accepted John's mes-
sage? Verses 3, 4.
   7. How did these believers then show their faith in Jesus? How did the
Lord show His approval? How many were in this new company? Verses 5-7.
    8. How long did Paul continue to speak in the Jewish synagogue? What
is said of his way of working? Verse 8.
   9. What led Paul to seek another location for his meetings? Verse 9.
   Num.—We know of Tyrannus "that his school was one of considerable in-
fluence," as this "is implied .by the fact that from it the entire province was
reached with the gospel."—A New Standard Bible Dictionary, page 927.
   10. How long did Paul remain there? How extensive was the influence
of his work? Verse 10.
   NorE.—"The language of Luke here implies that the audience of Paul was
made up not of the settled inhabitants of Ephesus only, but of those who vis-
                                      [4]

ited the city for business or pleasure, and carried news of the preacher and his
message to all corners of the district."—The Cambridge Bible.
   11. How did God manifest His power in connection with the work of
the apostle? Verses 11, 12.
   NOTE.—"The imperfect tense of the verb in the Greek implies that these
manifestations of God's power were continued during the apostle's stay. This
was no mere spasmodic excitement over some powerful discourse."—The Cam-
bridge Bible.
                      An Attempted Counterfeit
   12. What effort was made by some to counterfeit the miracles wrought?
Verse 13.
   13. 'Who are especially mentioned as trying to cast out evil spirits?
What answer did the evil spirit make? How were these men overcome?
Verses 14-16.
   NOTE.—An "exorcist" was one who pretended to cast out evil spirits by
charms or magic. In this case the name of Jesus was used in imitation of Paul.
   "Thus unmistakable proof was given of the sacredness of the name of Christ,
and the peril which they incurred who should invoke it without faith in the
divinity of the Saviour's mission."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 288.
   14. How widely was this experience known? How was this a help to
the Lord's work? Verse 17.
   NOTE.—"Facts which had previously been concealed were now brought to
light. In accepting Christianity, some of the believers had not fully renounced
                                      [ 51
their superstitions. To some extent they still continued the practice of magic.
Now, convinced of their error, 'many that believed came, and confessed, and
showed their deeds.' Even to some of the sorcerers themselves the good work
extended."—Ibid.
                 Repentance Practically Demonstrated
   15. How were the true fruits of repentance shown by many? Verses
18, 19.
   NOTE.—These men did not sell their books for others to use, as they might
have done, but destroyed them so that they could do no further harm.
   "These treatises on divination contained rules and forms of communica-
tion with evil spirits. They were the regulations of the worship of Satan,—
directions for soliciting his help and obtaining information from him. By
retaining these books the disciples would have exposed themselves to tempta-
tion; by selling them• they would have placed temptation in the way of others.
. . .
   "It is fondly supposed that heathen superstitions have disappeared before
the civilizatiod of the twentieth century. But the word of God and the stern
testimony of facts declare that sorcery is practiced in this age as verily as in
the days of the old-time magicians. The ancient system of magic is, in reality,
the same as what is now known as modern spiritualism. Satan is finding ac-
cess to thousands of minds by presenting himself under the guise of departed
friends. The Scriptures declare that 'the dead know not anything.' Their
thoughts, their love, their hatred, have perished. The dead do not hold com-
munion with the living. But true to his early cunning, Satan employs this
device in order to gain control of minds."—The Acts of the Apostles, pages
288, 289.
   "In this Greek city the pieces of silver were probably. Attic drachmas,
worth about twenty cents each, the whole being worth ten thousand dollars,
but in purchasing power that sum was equal to perhaps one hundred thou-
sand dollars of our money."—Peloubet's Select Notes.
   16. After this victory, what is said of the word of God? Verse 20.
                           Think on These Things
  The proof of our being Christians is seen in the giving up of all wrong no
matter what the cost, and the acceptance of the right.
  Not numbers, but consecration, is essential.
  The responsibility for a decision.


                       Lesson 2, for April 12, 1941
                          Trouble at Ephesus
    SCRIPTURE: Acts 19:21-41.
    MEMORY VERSE: "Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any
likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is
in the water under the earth: thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them."
Ex. 20:4, 5.
    STUDY HELP: "The Acts of the Apostles," pp. 291-297.
    PLACE : The city of Ephesus, capital of Ionia, a celebrated city in Asia Minor.
    PERSONS: Paul; Timothy; Erastus ; Demetrius; Gaius ; Aristarchus ; Alexan-
der; town clerk, a scribe, "the acting head of the municipal government at Ephesus."
                                           (6)
                         Setting of the Lesson
   "For over three years Ephesus was the center of Paul's work. A flourishing
church was raised up here, and from this city the gospel spread throughout the
province of Asia, among both Jews and Gentiles. . . .
   "Once a year, special ceremonies were held at Ephesus in honor of the
goddess Diana. These attracted great numbers of people from all parts of the
province. Throughout this period, festivities were conducted with the utmost
pomp and splendor. . . .
   "Paul's labors had given the heathen 'worship a telling blow, in consequence
of which there was a perceptible falling off in the attendance at the national
festival, and in the enthusiasm of the worshipers. The influence of his teach-
ings extended far beyond the actual converts to the faith. Many who had not
openly accepted the new doctrines, became so far enlightened as to lose all
confidence in their heathen gods."—The Acts of the Apostles, pages 291, 292.

                   Paul Again Looks to Macedonia
   I. As Paul's work at Ephesus was about completed, what further itin-
erary did he plan? What two cities did he wish to visit? Acts 19:21.
   2. Whom did he send ahead into Macedonia? Verse 22.
   NOTE.—"Feeling that the cause in Ephesus still demanded his presence, he
[Paul] decided to remain until after Pentecost. An event soon occurred, how-
ever, which hastened his departure."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 291.

           Ephesus Stirred by the Speech of Demetrius
   3. What agitation was started at that time? Who led in the trouble that
was made? What was his occupation? What is said of the profits of the
business? Verses 23, 24.
   NorE.—The temple of Diana was one of the seven wonders of the ancient
world, and was two hundred twenty years in building. It was of purest marble,
and is said to have "gleamed far off with a starlike radiance." One hundred
twenty-seven pillars, each of them the gift of a king, and some of which were
carved with designs of exquisite beauty, surrounded the structure. In the
center of the building was the shrine containing the image of Diana, which was
hidden from view by the vast folds of a purple embroidered curtain of finest
texture. It is probable that "there was no religious building in the world in
which was concentrated a greater amount of admiration, enthusiasm, and su-
perstition." Writers tell us that there is nothing now on the spot to show what
or where this temple was.
   4. What appeal did Demetrius make to his fellow craftsmen? Who did
he say was responsible for the decline in their business of making shrines?
Verses 25, 26.
   5. How did he further appeal to the idolatrous prejudices of the peo-
ple? Verse 27.
   NorE.—There was constant demand for the silver shrines. The rich
bought them and gave them to the temple, where they were hung. The priests
occasionally cleared away the older ones to make room for new gifts. Some
of these statues were placed in dwellings for the protection of the house;
small ones were worn or carried as charms against disease or accident. The
sales to travelers, pilgrims, and merchants who visited Ephesus were large.
                                       7]
  6. What effect did the speech of Demetrius have upon the silversmiths?
Verse 28.
              Paul's Companions Caught by the Mob
   7. How widely did the excitement extend? What was done with two
of Paul's companions in travel? Verse 29.
   NOTE.— A report of the speech made by Demetrius was rapidly circulated
among all classes of people. The city was filled with confusion.
   "Search was made for Paul, but the apostle was not to be found. His
brethren, receiving an intimation of the danger, had hurried him from the
place. Angels of God had been sent to guard the apostle; his time to die
a martyr's death had not yet come. Failing to find the object of their wrath,
the mob seized 'Gaius and Aristarchus"'—The Acts of the Apostles, page 293.
     8. What did Paul wish to do? How was he hindered in his desire?
 What message did he receive from friends in the theater? Verses 30, 31.
     NorE.—"Paul's place of concealment was not far distant, and he soon
 learned of the peril of his beloved brethren. Forgetful of his own safety, he
 desired to go at once to the theater to address the rioters. But 'the disciples
suffered him not.' Gaius and Aristarchus were not the prey the people sought;
 no serious harm 10. them was apprehended. But should the apostle's pale,
 careworn face be seen, it would arouse at once the worst passions of the mob,
 and there would not be the least human possibility of saving his life. Paul was
still eager to defend the truth before the multitude; but he was at last de-
 terred by a message of warning from the theater."—The Acts of the Apos-
 tles, page 293.
     9. What state of confusion marked this great assemblage of people?
 Verse 32.
     10. Whom did the Jews put forward to speak in their defense? Verse
33.
     NOTE.—The Jews wished to show the enraged people that they had no
sympathy with Paul, and they brought forth one of their number to speak
against him. Because he was a Jew, they would not listen to him, and the
uproar continued.
    11. When the people knew that Alexander was a Jew, what did they
do? Acts 19:34.
    NorE.—"The fact that Paul and some of his companions were of Hebrew
extraction, made the Jews anxious to show plainly that they were not sym-
pathizers with him and his work. They therefore brought forward one of
their own number to set the matter before the people. The speaker chosen
was Alexander, one of the craftsmen, a coppersmith, to whom Paul after-
ward referred as having done him much evil. [2 Tim. 4:14.] Alexander was
a man of considerable ability, and he bent all his energies to direct the wrath
of the people exclusively against Paul and his companions. But the crowd,
seeing that Alexander was a Jew, thrust him aside."—The Acts of the Apos-
tles, page 294.
                     The Town Clerk Intervenes
  12. When the two-hour tumult ceased, what appeal was made by the
town clerk? Verse 35.
                               [81
   13. Believing, as they claimed, that the image of Diana came down
from heaven, how should they have acted? Verse 36.
   14. What defense of Paul and his companions did the town clerk then
make? Verse 37.
   15. What should Demetrius and the others have done if they had any
just cause of complaint? Verses 38, 39.
   NoTE.—The Revised Version reads: "The courts are open, and, there are
proconsuls: let them accuse one another."
   16. Of what danger did the town clerk remind them? What did he
then do? Verses 40, 41.
   NoTE.—There was danger that the Roman government might interfere
and take away prized liberties from a city in which noisy riots occurred with-
out cause.
   "The decision of the recorder and of others holding honorable offices in
the city had set Paul before the people as one innocent of any unlawful act.
This was another triumph of Christianity over error and superstition. God
had raised up a great magistrate to vindicate His apostle and hold the tu-
multuous mob in check. Paul's heart was filled with gratitude to God that
his life had been preserved, and that Christianity had not been brought into
disrepute by the tumult at Ephesus."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 295.
                        Think on These Things

                     Lesson 3, for April 19, 1941
            Paul Journeys Toward Jerusalem
  SCRIPTURE: Acts 20.
   MEMORY VERSE: "Remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how He said, It is
more blessed to give than to receive." Acts 20:35.
  STUDY HELP: "The Acts of the Apostles," pp. 389-396.
  PLACES: Macedonia; Greece; Philippi; Troas; Assos; Miletus; message to
Ephesus.
   PERSONS: Paul; Luke; Timothy; six otlier brethren from different churches;
Eutychus ; elders from the church at Ephesus.

                         Setting of the Lesson
   Paul desired to end his third missionary tour by returning to Jerusalem
in time for the Passover. This feast would give him "an opportunity to meet
those who should come from all parts of the world to attend the feast. Ever
he cherished the hope that in some way he might be instrumental in remov-
ing the prejudice of his unbelieving countrymen, so that they might be led
to accept the precious light of the gospel. He also desired to meet the church
at Jerusalem, and bear to them the gifts sent by the Gentile churches to the
                                      [9 3
poor brethren in Judea. And by this visit he hoped to bring about a firmer
union between the Jewish and the Gentile converts to the faith."—The Acts
of the Apostles, page 389.
                Paul Revisits Macedonia and Greece
   1. To what country did Paul go when he left Ephesus? Acts 20:1.
    2. Review the circumstances which led to Paul's first visit to Mace-
donia. Acts 16:9.
    3. After revisiting the churches in Macedonia, where did Paul then
go? How long did he remain in Greece? What interfered with his plans
for sailing directly to Palestine? Acts 20:2, 3.
   NorE.—Probably Paul spent a large part of this time at Corinth. It is
exceedingly interesting to note what he wrote to the church at Corinth con-
cerning his experiences. He speaks of being amid sickness and afflictions on
every side, of fightings without and fears within (2 Cor. 4:7-11), of caring
for all the churches (2 Cor. 11:28), and of correcting wrong conduct (2 Cor.
12:20, 21; 13:1, 2). It must have been four or five years since he had left
Corinth after a stay of a year and a half with them.
   "All the arrangements had been made, and he was about to step on board
the ship, when he was told of a plot laid by the Jews to take his life. In
the past these opposers of the faith had been foiled in all their efforts to put
an end to the apostle's work. . . . Upon receiving warning of the plot, Paul
decided to go around by way of Macedonia. His plan to reach Jerusalem
in time for the Passover services had to be given up, but he hoped to be there
at Pentecost."—The Acts of the Apostles, pages 389, 390.
   4. Who accompanied Paul on his journey to Jerusalem? Acts 20:4.
   NOTE.—"Paul had with him a large sum of money from the Gentile
churches, which he purposed to place in the hands of the brethren in charge
of the work in Judea; and because of this he made arrangements for these
representative brethren from various contributing churches, to accompany
him to Jerusalem."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 390.

    Paul and His Companions Journey Toward Jerusalem
   5. Where was the meeting place of Paul's company? Where did Paul
tarry for a few days? How long did it take to reach Troas? How many
days did Paul and his company remain there? Verses 5, 6.
   NorE.—"At Philippi Paul tarried to keep the Passover. Only Luke re-
mained with him, the other members of the company passing on to Troas
to await him there. The Philippians were the most loving and truehearted
of the apostle's converts, and during the eight days of the feast he enjoyed
peaceful and happy communion with them.
   "Sailing from Philippi, Paul and Luke reached their companions at Troas
five days later, and remained for seven days with the believers in that place."
—The Acts of the Apostles, pages 390, 391.
   6. On what day of the week was their parting meeting held with the
church at Troas? How long did Paul continue his sermon? Verses 7, 8.
   NorE.—That this was an evening meeting is clear from the fact that there
were many lights needed, and that Paul preached until midnight, and after
the interruption, continued until the "break of day." A meeting held on the
                                    [101
evening after the Sabbath, according to the Bible method of computing time,
would be on the first day of the week.
   "The meeting was held on what we should call Saturday evening; but we
must remember that the Jewish first day began from sundown on Saturday
or the Sabbath."—The Expositor's Bible (Acts), vol. 2, p. 393.
   "Upon the last evening of his stay the brethren 'came together to break
bread' The fact that their beloved teacher was about to depart, had called
together a larger company than usual.. They assembled in an 'upper chamber'
on the•third story. There, in the fervency of his love and solicitude for them,
the apostle preached until midnight."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 391.
   7. What accident occurred while Paul was preaching? How was mourn-
ing turned to joy? Verses 9, 10.
   NOTE.—"In one of the open windows sat a youth named Eutychus. In
this perilous position he went to sleep, and fell to the court below. At once
all was alarm and confusion. The youth was taken up dead, and many
gathered about him with cries and mourning. But Paul, passing through the
frightened company, embraced him, and offered up an earnest prayer that
God would restore the dead 10.life. His petition was granted."—The Acts of the
Apostles, page 391.
   8. How was the remainder of the night spent? What did Paul do at
break of day? What greatly comforted the brethren? Verses 11, 12.
    9. After this evening farewell meeting, what did Luke say that he and
his companions did? Verse 13.
   NOTE.—The route by boat from Troas to Assos lay around the promon-
tory, but the distance straight across by land, over a well-paved road, was
only about nineteen miles, and Paul chose to walk.
   "The ship on which Paul and his companions were to continue their jour-
ney, was about to sail, and the brethren hastened on board. The apostle him-
self, however, chose to take the nearer route by land between Troas and
Assos, meeting his companions at the latter city. This gave him a short season
for meditation and prayer. The difficulties and dangers connected with his
coming visit to Jerusalem, the attitude of the church there toward him and his
work, as well as the condition of the churches and the interests of the gospel
work in other fields, were subjects of earnest, anxious thought; and he took
advantage of this special opportunity to seek God for strength and guidance."
—The Acts of the Apostles, pages 391, 392.
   Paul started to walk across on Sunday morning after his all-night service
with the brethren, and he reached Assos in time to join the ship's company.
   10. Why did Paul not stop at Ephesus, his former field of labor?
Verses 15, 16.

        •       The Farewell to the Ephesian Elders
   11. When Paul learned that the ship would tarry for a time in the
harbor of Miletus, for whom did he send? Verse 17.
   NOTE.—Ephesus was about thirty miles north of Miletus. The time of
the ship's sailing being uncertain, Paul sent for the leaders of the church at
Ephesus to meet him at Miletus.
   12. How did the apostle address the Ephesian elders? With what un-
certainty did he regard his future? Verses 18-24.

   13. What solemn declaration did Paul make to the Ephesian brethren?
From what was he free? What had he not failed to do? Verses 25-27.
   NoTE.—"Paul had not designed to bear this testimony, but while he was
speaking, the Spirit of inspiration came upon him, confirming his fears that
this would be his last meeting with his Ephesian brethren."—The Acts of
the Apostles, page 393.
   14. What warning did the apostle give these leaders? What would
come to pass after he was gone? What difficulties would also arise? Verses

whom did he commend them? Verses 31, 32.

    PLACES: Islands of Coos and Rhodes; Patara; Phenicia ; Tyre; Ptolemais; Cae-
sarea; Jerusalem.
    PERSONS: Paul and his company, including Luke; Philip and his four daughters;
the prophet Agabus ; disciples of Caesarea; Mnason of Cyprus.

                            Setting of the Lesson
   Paul was hastening to Jerusalem. He had said farewell to the delegation
that had come from Ephesus. His companions were Luke, Timothy, and six
brethren from different churches in Asia. Paul's arrival at Jerusalem marks
the end of his third missionary tour.
                  The Journey From Miletus to Tyre
   1. Sailing from Miletus, past what places did the course of Paul's ship
lie? Acts 21:1.
   NoTE.—Coos and Rhodes were small islands. The city of Rhodes was
famous for its Colossus, a great lighthouse made in the image of a man.
The structure was of brass, one hundred feet high. At one time vessels could
sail between the legs of the statue. The Colossus of Rhodes was numbered
as one of the seven wonders of the world.
    2. What transfer was made at Patara? What large island could be
seen on the left? What was the next landing place? Verses 2, 3.
   NOTE.—Sailing within sight of Cyprus, the apostle Paul could hardly
fail to recall his experience with Elymas, the sorcerer, when visiting that is-
land in company with Barnabas.
    3. While the ship was unloading, what did Paul and his company do?
What did the disciples there say to Paul? Verse 4.
    Norc.—"Through the Holy Spirit, these disciples were warned of the
perils awaiting Paul at Jerusalem, and they urged him 'that he should not
go up to Jerusalem.' But the apostle allowed not the fear of affliction and
imprisonment to turn him from his purpose."—The Acts of the Apostles,
page 396.
    4. On leaving Tyre who went with the missionaries to the ship? What
 was done before they parted? After the farewells were spoken what did
 each company do? Verse 5, 6.
    NOTE.—For what would they pray at a time like that? We are told
 that before Paul stepped on board the ship, "they knelt upon the shore and
 prayed, he for them, and they for him."—Ibid.
                          Paul Warned at Caesarea
   5. What was the next place at which Pala and his company stopped?
 Verse 7.
                                         [ 13 3
   6. What place did they reach the next day? Who provided them en-
tertainment at Caesarea? Who was this Philip? What is said of his
family? Verses 8, 9.
   NorE.—This is the same Philip who was chosen deacon (Acts 6:5), who
preached Jesus to the Samaritans (Acts 8:5), followed the leadings of
the Spirit which resulted in the conversion and baptism of the Ethiopian
eunuch, and was afterward "found" at Azotus, then "came" to Caesarea
(Acts 8:29-40). Now nearly twenty years later he entertains Paul and his
company in his home there.
  7. What is revealed concerning the length of time the visitors re-
mained at the house of Philip? Who visited them from Judea? Acts 21:10.
   8. How did Agabus illustrate his prophecy concerning Paul? Verse 11.
   NoTE.—It was the custom of the Hebrew prophets to deepen the inipres-
sign of their words by appropriate actions. Isaiah loosed the sackcloth from
his loins, and took off his shoes to emphasize his prophecy that the Egyptian
captives should be led away into Assyria naked and barefoot. Isaiah 20.
Jeremiah used his girdle in its strength and in its decay as a type of the
experience of Israel. Jeremiah 13.
   9. On hearing the words of Agabus, what did the companions, and
friends of Paul unite in doing? Acts 21:12.
   10. By what question did Paul kindly rebuke his friends? For what
did he say he was ready? Verse 13.
   NorE.—"He saw a hand they could not see,
                Which beckoned him away,
            He heard a voice they could not hear
               Which would not let him stay."
                              —Peloubet's Select Notes.
   11. What did the brethren finally say? Verse 14.
                             Journey's End
   12. From Caesarea, where did Paul and his company go? Verse 15.
   NOTE.—The word "carriage" is used in the old sense of things carried—
baggage.
   "Paul and his company set out for Jerusalem, their hearts deeply shad-
owed by the presentiment of coming evil. Never before had the apostle
approached Jerusalem with so sad a heart. He knew that he would find few
friends and many enemies. . . . And he could not count upon the sympathy
and support of even his own brethren in the faith. The unconverted Jews who
had followed so closely upon his track, had not been slow to circulate the
most unfavorable reports at Jerusalem, both personally and by letter, con-
cerning him and his work. . . . Yet in the midst of discouragements, the
apostle was not in despair. He trusted that the Voice which had spoken to
his own heart would yet speak to the hearts of his countrymen, and that
the Master whom his fellow disciples loved and served would yet unite their
hearts with his in the work of the gospel."—The Acts of the Apostles, pages
397, 398.
   13. Who accompanied them to Jerusalem? How were they received
when they arrived? Verses 16, 17.

                        Lesson 5, for May 3, 1941
     Paul at Jerusalem; Arrested in the Temple
    SCRIPTURE: Acts 21 :18-40.
    MEMORY VERSE: "Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness'
sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven." Matt. 5:10.
    STUDY HELP: "The Acts of the Apostles," pp. 399-408.
    PLACES: Jerusalem, in the temple, and on the stairs of the fortress of Antonia, a
prison connected with the palace.
    PERSONS: Paul and his company; James and the elders at Jerusalem; believing
Jews; four men under a vow; the chief captain and his soldiers; Trophimus.

                            Setting of the Lesson
    Paul's meeting at this time with the leaders and believers in Jerusalem
came under peculiarly difficult circumstances. Some of the leading brethren
still held prejudice against the methods of labor of Paul and his associates.
In face of this prejudice, Paul thought to bring greater harmony by yield-
ing to the advice of his brethren. Their counsel, born of expediency, led to
his long imprisonment and eventual death.
                      Paul Reports to His Brethren
   1. With whom did Paul and his associates meet the day after they
arrived in Jerusalem? What did Paul relate to the company? Acts 21:
18, 19.
   NOTE.—"On this occasion, Paul and his companions formally presented
to the leaders of the work at Jerusalem the contributions forwarded by the
Gentile churches for the support of the poor among their Jewish brethren.
The gathering of these contributions had cost the apostle and his fellow
workers much time, anxious thought, and wearisome labor. The sum,
which far exceeded the expectations of the elders at Jerusalem, represented
many sacrifices and even severe privations on the part of the Gentile be.-
lievers.
   "These freewill offerings betokened the loyalty of the Gentile converts
to the organized work of God throughout the world, and should have been
received by all with grateful acknowledgment; yet it was apparent to Paul and
his companions that even among those before whom they now stood were
some who were unable to appreciate the spirit of brotherly love that had
prompted the gifts."—The Acts of the Apostles, pages 399, 400

    3. Of what did they say the brethren at Jerusalem had been informed
concerning Paul's teaching? What would the multitude now hear? What
counsel did they urge upon Paul? Verses 21-24.
    NOTE.—"This was the golden opportunity for all the leading brethren to
confess frankly that God had wrought through Paul, and that at times they
had erred in permitting the reports of his enemies to arouse their jealousy
and prejudice. But instead of uniting in an effort to do justice to the one
who had been injured, they gave him counsel which showed that they still
cherished a feeling that Paul should be held largely responsible for the exist-

Verse 25.

 • 5. How did Paul show his great desire to be in harmony with the
Jewish brethren? Verse 26.
   NorE.—The ceremonies took about one week of time. To go through with
this, Paul was required to pay for sixteen sacrificial animals, to live with the
four very poor believers in a chamber of the temple, and to stand with them
while the priest offered the lambs in their behalf.
   "He [Paul] felt that if by any reasonable concession he could win them
to the truth, he would remove a great obstacle to the success of the gospel
                                     [ 16 I

they asked."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 405.
    6. What proved that the results of this concession were not what the
elders had expected? Verse 27.
    NorE.—"Instead of accomplishing the desired object, his efforts for con-
ciliation only precipitated the crisis, hastened his predicted sufferings, and
resulted in separating him from his brethren, depriving the church of one of
its strongest pillars, and bringing sorrow to Christian hearts in every land."

    8. What led them to suppose that Paul had brought Greeks into the
temple? Verse 29.
   NOTE.—Paul, being a Jew, had a right to be where he was, but to bring
Greeks into that part of the temple from which all Gentiles were excluded
was regarded as a crime punishable with death.
    9. How widespread was the excitement raised against Paul? What
did they do with him? Verse 30.
    10. What was their purpose concerning Paul? To whom were tidings
of this uproar brought? What prompt action did he take? Verses 31, 32.

Paul from the mob.
    11. Why could the chief captain not understand the answer to his ques-
tions? What did he command the soldiers to do with Paul? Verses 33, 34.
    NOTE.—The "castle" was the fortress of Antonia located at one corner of
the temple. This fortress was connected with the temple grounds by two
flights of steps.
    12. What was necessary in order to protect Paul from the anger of
the people? Verses 35, 36.
    13. As Paul was about to be led into the castle, what question did he
ask the captain? What caused the captain to express surprise? Whom had
he thought Paul to be? Verses 37, 38.
   NorE.—The historian Josephus mentions the "Egyptian" whom Claudius
Lysias thought Paul to be. This man had gathered a large number of dis-
contented Jews on Mount Olivet. He claimed to be the Christ, and told them
he could make the walls of Jerusalem fall if he but spoke the word. Felix,
the governor, sent soldiers against this company, and they fled. It is said
that there were four thousand assassins among them who carried daggers,
and many of them were thieves.

           Paul's Address on the Castle Stairs
   SCRIPTURE: Acts 22.
   MEMORY VERSE: "The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest
know His will." Acts 22:14.
   STUDY HELP: "The Acts of the Apostles," pp. 408-410.
   PLACE: Stairs leading up to the tower of Antonia in Jerusalem.
   PERSONS: Paul; Claudius Lysias, the chief captain; centurion and soldiers;
Jews; chief priests; the Sanhedrin, the highest authority among the Jews. Reference
made to Gamaliel, Ananias, and Stephen.

                           Setting of the Lesson
   Paul had been seized by the angry Jews while he was in the temple, and
they sought to take his life. He was protected from his enemies by Roman
soldiers under the command of Claudius Lysias, the chief captain. Paul asked
permission to speak to the Jews, and the captain consented.
                     Paul Addresses the Multitude
   1. By what courteous introduction did Paul gain the attention of his
hearers? What helped in arousing the interest? Acts 22: 1, 2.
   NorE.—"Paul's every word and act at this moment of supreme danger
evinces remarkable courage, coolness, and self-possession. His one thought
now was to seize the occasion of speaking to the people, when he had a great
crowd before him, with their attention fixed on him. This might be an op-
portunity of bringing home the truth to them."—Peloubet's Select Notes.
   "Had he [Paul] spoken in Greek, the majority of those who heard him
would have understood his words. But the sound of the holy tongue in that
holy place fell like a calm on the troubled waters. The silence became universal
and breathless."—Conybeare and Howson, The Life and Epistles of Saint
Paul, chapter 21.
   2. What did Paul say of his early life and training? How did he refer
to his former zeal as a persecutor of the Christians? Verses 3-5.
   NoTE.—In beginning his address, Paul referred to those things which would
give him influence among the Jews. Gamaliel was the most famous teacher
of that time. It is said of him, "His learning was so eminent and his char-
acter so revered, that he is one of the seven who alone among Jewish doctors
have been honored with the title of `Rabban.' " He it was who gave counsel
against slaying Peter and others. Acts 5:34-40. He was still living, an aged
man, when Paul spoke, but died three years later, while Paul was on his
journey to Rome.
   But in another school, at the feet of the divine Teacher, this pupil had
exchanged the dead forms of learned rabbinical teaching for the life-trans-
forming and saving truths of the gospel, "determined not to know anything
among you, save Jesus Christ, and Him crucified." 1 Cor. 2:2.
   3. What does Paul say of the way he was changed from this course of
action? What conversation does he repeat? Acts 22:6-8.
   NOTE.—Paul saw Jesus, and heard His voice; and that one glimpse of the
Saviour won his heart and changed his life. It was conversion. Not with the
same physical demonstration, but just as truly, Jesus, by His Spirit, seeks to
reveal Himself to every soul.
                                     [18 }
   4. How were Paul's companions affected by this vision? Verse 9.
   NoTE.—To the casual reader there may seem to be a contradiction be-
tween Acts 22:9 and Acts 9:7.
   "Paul heard intelligible words, the others heard a sound, but it was not
speech to them. . . . 'Heard not the voice,' that is, the words which were
spoken to Saul. They were only conscious of a sound around them."—The
Cambridge Bible.
   5. What was Paul's first question after recognizing that Jesus was
the Lord? What reply to his earnest question did Paul receive? Acts 22:10.
   6. How was he enabled, in his blindness, to reach Damascus? Verse 11.
   7. How was he delivered from this helpless condition? Verses 12, 13.
   8. For what four things did Ananias say God had chosen Paul? Verses
14, 15.
   9. To what Christian duty was his attention next called? Verse 16.
   10. When Paul made his first visit to Jerusalem, after his conversion,
what experience came to him? Verses 17, 18.
   11. What led him at that time to feel that he ought to bear his witness
in Jerusalem? But what direct command did the Lord give to him?
Verses 19-21.
                         An Uproar Follows
    12. At this point in Paul's address, what did the people say and do?
Verses 22, 23.
    NoTE.—"Hitherto the people had listened with close attention, but when
Paul reached the point in his history where he was appointed Chr ist's am-
bassador to the Gentiles, their fury broke forth anew. Accustomed to look
upon themselves as the only people favored by God, they were unwilling to
permit the despised Gentiles to share the privileges which had hitherto been
regarded as exclusively their own. Lifting their voices above the voice of
the speaker they cried, 'Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is
not fit that he should live.'"—The Acts of the Apostles, pages 409, 410.
    13. What order did the chief captain then give? What did he wish to
know? Verse 24.
    NOTE.—"He [the chief captain] had not been able to understand the apos-
tle's Hebrew speech; and, when he saw its results, he concluded that his
prisoner must be guilty of some enormous crime. . . . Before long the
body of the apostle was 'stretched out,' like that of a common malefactor,
'to receive the lashes.' "—Conybeare and Howson, The Life and Epistles of
Saint Paul, chapter 21.
             Paul Asserts Rights as a Roman Citizen
   14. How was the captain's plan interrupted? Verses 25, 26.
   NOTE.—To scourge a koman citizen was a grave crime, and these Roman
officers were afraid to proceed with their plans when they learned that Paul
was a Roman citizen.
   15. What conversation followed? With what result? Verses 27-29
(see margin).
   16. What action was taken by the chief captain the next day? Verse 30.

overcome the world." John 16:33.
   The apostle told his experience. Exhortation without experience is all too
often ineffective.

and Pharisees; forty conspirators; Claudius Lysias, the chief captain; Paul's nephew;
two centurions, and a soldier escort, horsemen and spearmen; Felix, the Roman gov-
ernor.
                            Setting of the Lesson
    The apostle Paul had been cast out of the temple, but Claudius Lysias,
the chief captain, had been unable to find out what he had done that was
wrong, for in the confusion "some cried one thing, some another, among the
multitude." When Paul spoke from the castle stairs, Lysias could not under-
stand him, for Paul spoke in the Hebrew tongue. When the Jews would not
listen longer, and began to cry out against Paul, the thief captain thought he
must be a very wicked man. He gave orders to have him scourged, expecting
that he would then confess his evil deeds, but when Paul let it be known that
he was a Roman citizen, this plan was abandoned as "unlawful." Then the
chief captain asked the Sanhedrin to meet and brought Paul before them that
he might understand what fault the Jews found with him.
                      Before the Jewish Sanhedrin
   1. When brought before the Sanhedrin, how did Paul begin his de-
fense? Acts 23:1.
   Nom.—"The apostle was now to be tried by the same tribunal of which he
himself had been a member before his conversion. As he stood before the
Jewish rulers, his bearing was calm, and his countenance revealed the peace of
Christ."—The Acts of the Apostles, pages 410, 411.
   2. How was the apostle's declaration of sincerity received? Verse 2.
   3. What reply did the apostle make to the command of the high priest?
Verse 3.
   Nom.—These words were not an outburst of passion. They were not a
malediction, nor a wishing of evil upon the high priest. Like Christ's woes
against the scribes and Pharisees (Matt. 23:13-33), they were an expression
of belief that such conduct ought to be and would be punished. History tells
                                         20
us that within two years Ananias was deposed, and four years later, when his
son and a band of assassins in rebellion sought his life, he hid in a sewer of
the palace, but was drawn out and slain.
   4. What did those standing by ask Paul? What excuse did he offer?
What words did he quote to show his respect for those in authority? Acts
23:4, 5.
   NorE.—Paul did not know it was the high priest to whom he had spoken.
In reality, Ananias was not legally the high priest. He had been deposed from
the office for bad conduct, and sent to Rome to answer. Released, he re-
turned to Jerusalem, and found that his successor had been assassinated, and
the office was vacant.
   "The Sanhedrin being destitute of a president, Ananias appears to have
discharged that office by his own authority, and with much tyranny, and he
might not then have worn the robes of the high priest."—Henry and Scott's
Commentary.
          Paul Takes Advantage of Conflicting Beliefs
   5. What division in the council was Paul quick to perceive? How did
he take advantage of this? Verse 6.
   Nom.—Paul took advantage of the differences in belief of the Pharisees
and Sadducees to divert attention from himself. His belief in the resurrec-
tion centered in the fact that Jesus had risen from the grave, which of course
the Sadducees did not accept, for they did not believe in the doctrine of the
resurrection of the dead. What Paul said was strictly true, and at that time
served to win the favor of the Pharisees.
   6. What confusion did Paul's statement make in the council? What
difference was there in the belief of the Pharisees and Sadducees? Verses
7, 8.
   7. What had Paul written regarding the importance of the belief that
Jesus was risen from the dead? 1 Cor. 15:16-18.
   8. What did the Pharisees cry out? When the Jews became violent in
their anger, what did the chief captain fear? How was Paul again rescued
from the violence of the mob? Acts 23:9, 10.
   NoTE.—The council came to no decision as to the charge against Paul.
           A Message of Hope; The Plot Against Paul
   9. What cheering message came to Paul following his rescue from mob
violence? Verse 11.
   NoTE.—"Later, while reflecting on the trying experiences of the day, Paul
began to fear that his course might not have been pleasing to God. Could it
be that he had made a mistake after all in visiting Jerusalem? Had his great
desire to be in union with his brethren led 10. this disastrous result? . . .
   "And now he was in prison, and he knew that his enemies, in their des-
perate malice, would resort to any means to put him to death. Could it be
that his work for the churches was ended, and that ravening wolves were to
enter in now? The cause of Christ was very near to Paul's heart, and with

they were to the persecutions of just such men as he had encountered in the
Sanhedrin council. In distress and discouragement, he wept and prayed."—
The Acts of the Apostles, pages 412, 413.
   10. What desperate plot against Paul's life was entered into by a num-
ber of men? What was their plan? Verses 12-15.
   NOTE.—"Instead of rebuking this cruel scheme, the priests and rulers
eagerly agreed to it. Paul had spoken the truth when he compared Ananias to
a whited sepulcher."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 414.
   11. How was this plot made known to Paul? What steps did Paul then
take? Verses 16, 17.
   12. How was this knowledge given to Lysias, the chief captain? What
appeal did the young man make in behalf of his uncle? Verses 18-21.
   13. What warning did the chief captain give the young man? What
prompt action was taken by the chief captain? Verses 22-24.
                    Paul Transferred to Caesarea
    14. What friendly communication did Lysias, the chief captain, send to
Felix, the governor? Verses 25-27.
    NOTE.—"Lysias at once decided to transfer Paul from his jurisdiction to
that of Felix the procurator. As a people, the Jews were in a state of excite-
ment and irritation, and tumults were of frequent occurrence. The continued
presence of the apostle in Jerusalem might lead to consequences dangerous to
the city, and even to the' commandant himself."—The Acts of the Apostles,
page 415.
    15. What preliminary steps did Lysias say he had taken in Paul's case?
How was the message to the governor concluded? Verses 28-30.
   16. How faithfully did the soldiers carry out their orders? Verses
31-33.
   NOTE.—Antipatris was forty-two miles from Jerusalem. The escort and
their prisoner made the forced march in a night. Next day the escort on foot
started the march back to Jerusalem while the mounted soldiers rode to
Caesarea, twenty-six miles farther on.
    So within a fortnight Paul was back in Caesarea, where his friends were
who had besought him not to go to Jerusalem. He probably entered the city
in the broad light of day, attended by "threescore and ten" horsemen. How
unlike his present escort was the humble Christian company that had but a
few days before attended him on the journey from Caesarea! No doubt he
was quickly recognized by Philip and others whose hearts were shocked and
saddened by the seeming calamity that had overtaken their beloved leader.
   17. When Felix had read the letter sent by the chief captain, what
question did he ask? When would he hear Paul's story? In the meantime
where was Paul to be kept? Verses 34, 35.

   SCRIPTURE: Acts 24.

   STUDY HELPS: "The Acts of the Apostles," pp. 419-427, "Steps to Christ,"
chapter on "Confession."
   PLACE: Caesarea, on the Mediterranean, the Roman capital of Judea.
   PERSONS: Paul; Felix, Roman governor of Judea; Ananias, the high priest from
Jerusalem; Jewish elders; Tertullus, lawyer and orator; Drusilla, wife of Felix; Por-
cius Festus, Felix's successor.
                            Setting of the Lesson
   Paul had been brought to Caesarea under escort of a soldier guard pro-
vided by Lysias, the chief captain in Jerusalem. In the trial Felix was the
judge. There were no jurors. Paul was brought into the court. Tertullus
brought the charges, to be confirmed by witnesses from Jerusalem. Paul had
been kept prisoner in Herod's judgment hall.
                   Tertullus's Address Before Felix
   1. How long a time elapsed before Paul's accusers came from Jeru-
salem to Caesarea? Acts 24:1.
   NoTE.—"Five days later a deputation arrived from Jerusalem bearing
charges against the prisoner—Ananias, the high priest who had ordered an
officer to smite Paul on the mouth for declaring his innocence, the most in-
fluential of the Jewish rulers; certain elders who would confirm the charges
against Paul; and an eloquent Roman lawyer named Tertullus whom they
brought with them on account of his superior knowledge of Roman law and
methods of court procedure, his skill as a pleader, and the fact that a Roman
lawyer would have more influence, as an unbiased man, in a Roman court,
and could more easily make it appear that Paul 'was dangerous to the Roman
power, and not merely a turbulent and renegade Jew' "—Peloubet's Select
Notes.
   2. In beginning his speech, how did Tertullus falsely flatter Felix?
What did he ask of Felix? Verses 2-4.
   NcrrE.—Felix is said to have been the worst governor that ever ruled
Judea. "With all manner of cruelty and lust he exercised royal functions in
the spirit of a slave."—Tacitus, in A New Standard Bible Dictionary.
   While his character was base, he had put down bandits and robbers with an
iron hand. He had pursued and scattered the band of revolutionists led by the
fanatical Egyptian, for whom the Roman captain had at first mistaken Paul.
(See Acts 21:38.)
   Paul's own manner of address, a few moments later (Acts 24:10), was
respectful and complimentary, but without false flattery.
   3. How did Tertullus speak of Paul? What definite charges did he
make against him? Verses 5, 6.
   NOTE.—The charges might be listed under three heads:
   1. Sedition—disloyalty to the Roman government.
   2. Heresy, the ringleader of a sect that was apostate from the Jewish faith.
                                       [ 23 1
   3. Profaning the temple, and thus affronting a worship under the patron-
age and protection of Rome.
   The point to be obtained by this representation was to persuade Felix to
surrender Paul to be tried in the Jewish courts. This would have made his
destruction easy of accomplishment.
   4. What interference with the plans of the Jews did Tertullus resent?
What variation from the truth is noticeable in his words? Verses 7, 8.
See Acts 21:33, 34; 22:24-30.
   5. How was the plea of the lawyer supported? Acts 24:9.
   Nora.—"Felix had sufficient penetration to read the disposition and car-
acter of Paul's accusers. He knew from what motive they had flattered him,
and he saw also that they had failed to substantiate their charges against
Pail. Turning to the accused, he beckoned to him to answer for himself."—
The Acts of the Apostles, page 420.
                             Paul's Defense
   6. In what courteous terms did Paul open his defense? Verse 10.
   7. How long did Paul say he had been in Jerusalem? In what brief
statement did he refute all three of the charges made against him? Verses
11-13.
   8. What did he confess concerning his religion? What did he believe?
What hope did he have in God concerning the resurrection? Verses 14, 15.
   9. In what did the apostle exercise himself? Verse 16.
   NorE.—Paul had a good conscience, for there was nothing in his life which
he would not wish known. He was as faithful when making tents as when
preaching the gospel. He would do nothing he thought was wrong, and en-
deavored to avoid even the appearance of evil.
   10. After long absence from Jerusalem, what evidence of good will for
the Jewish people did he show? Verse 17.
   11. Where had certain Jews from Asia found Paul? What were the
circumstances which showed that he was not stirring up trouble? Verses
18-21.
                      Felix Defers His Decision
   12. After listening to Paul's defense, what did Felix do? What excuse
did he give for deferring his decision? Verse 22.
   NorE.—"This reference to Lysias may have been a device for turning away
the Jews, an excuse Icor the temporary dismissal of the case, and need not
imply that Felix was in doubt regarding Paul's innocence. There is no record
that Lysias ever came to Caesarea, or that Felix made any effort to have
him come. It is not probable that the Jews waited long in Caesarea on such
an,uncertainty."—Gilbert, Students Life of Paul.
   13. Although still a prisoner, what privileges were to be given the
apostle? Verse 23.
   14. What opportunity was given him to present the gospel to Felix?
Verses 24, 25.
  NOTE.—"Paul regarded this as a God-given opportunity, and faithfully he
improved it. He knew that he stood in the presence of one who had power
                                   [24]
to put him to death, or to set him free; yet he did not address Felix and
Drusilla with praise or flattery. . . . So violent and cruel had been the
course of Felix, that few had ever before dared even to intimate to him that his
character and conduct were not faultless. But Paul had no fear of man. . .
Thus Paul, the prisoner, urged the claims of the divine law upon Jew and
Gentile, and presented Jesus, the despised Nazarene, as the Son of God, the
world's Redeemer. . . . Felix had never before listened to the truth; and
as the Spirit of God sent conviction to his soul, he became deeply agitated.
Conscience, now aroused, made her voice heard; and Felix felt that Paul's
words were true. Memory went back over the guilty past. . . . But instead
of permitting his convictions to lead him to repentance, he sought to dis-
miss these unwelcome reflections. The interview with Paul was cut short."
—The Acts of the Apostles, pages 422-426.
   15. What hope did the governor cherish concerning Paul? How long
was Paul unjustly left in prison? Verses 26, 27.
   NoTE.—"Felix visited him [Paul] several times, and listened attentively
to his words. But the real motive for this apparent friendliness was a desire
for gain, and he intimated that by the payment of a large sum of money
Paul might secure his release. The apostle, however, was of too noble a nature
to free himself by a bribe. He was not guilty of any crime, and he would
 not stoop to commit a wrong in order to gain freedom. Furthe  rmore, he was
himself too poor to pay such a ransom, had he been disposed to do so, and he
would not, in his own behalf, appeal to the sympathy and generosity of his
Agiverts."—The Acts of the Apostles, pages 426, 427.
                                     [25 ]
   The inspired record leaves Felix in his baseness, doing injustice to Paul
to please the Jews. The "convenient season" never came. "Never was he
to receive another call from God."—Ibid., page 427.
   It is the opinion of historians that Drusilla and her son perished in the
great eruption of Vesuvius, A. n. 79. One of those shapeless human forms
dug out of the ashes and lava beds of Pompeii in recent years may represent
the wicked but beautiful princess who listened to Paul's sermon that day in
Caesarea when he called her in vain to repent before the judgment to come.

    PLACES: Caesarea; Jerusalem.
    PERSONS: Paul, a prisoner; Festus, governor of Judea; Jews from Jerusalem;
Herod Agrippa II, king of the regions north of the sea of Galilee; Bernice, sister and
also illegal wife of Agrippa; chief captains and leading men of Caesarea.

                            Setting of the Lesson
   Felix, desiring to please the Jews, kept Paul in, prison, although no charge
against him had been proved. He was granted many favors, but he was a
prisoner for two years. Then Porcius Festus was appointed governor in place
of Felix. That Paul's enemies had not forgotten him, but were simply await-
ing a favorable time to renew their efforts to have him put to death, is
evident from this lesson.
                  The Jewish Request — Festus's Plan
   '1. Who succeeded Felix as governor of Judea? Acts 24:27.
    2. After Festus became governor, what city did he soon visit? What
favor did Paul's enemies ask of Festus? What was their evil motive in
making this request? Acts 25:1-3.
    Nom—The spread of the gospel irritated the Jews, and they still con-
sidered Paul a leader in the movement. They poured into the ears of the
new governor all the charges Tertullus had brought against Paul, and urged
that Festus bring Paul to Jerusalem for trial since the accusations against
him were chiefly on the ground of breaking the Jewish law. They planned
to assassinate Paul while he was on the way from Caesarea to Jerusalem,
with much better chance of success than their plan of two years before.
   3. What reply did the governor make to the request of the Jews? What
better plan did he propose? Verses 4, 5.
                                        [ 26 ')
    NOTE.—"Festus held firmly to his purpose of giving Paul a fair trial at
Caesarea. God in His providence controlled the decision of Festus, that the
life of the apostle might be lengthened."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 429.
    The unprejudiced Roman governor was more susceptible to the influence
of God's Spirit than the Jewish priests who had year after year been re-
jecting light and instruction.
    4. How long did Festus remain in Jerusalem? When he returned to
Caesarea how promptly did he act in Paul's case? Verse 6.
               Paul Called Before Festus for Trial
   5. Who were there to accuse Paul? What is said of the charges they
made? What was lacking in these charges? What brief statement did
Paul make in reply? Verses 7, 8.
   NoTE.—During the two years since they had last had opportunity to ac-
cuse Paul, they had "gathered up every rumor which they could collect, and
these they brought forward, even though they could not support them by
evidence."—The Cambridge Bible.
   6. What question, pleasing to the Jews, did Festus ask Paul? Verse 9.
   NoTE.—The question was whether Paul would accept acquittal from the
Roman court on condition that he submit to a trial before the Jews on the
other matters which would naturally come before the Sanhedrin. Thus Festus
would throw upon Paul the responsibility of refusing to go to Jerusalem. The
Jewish leaders would thus see that Festus had thrown no obstacles in the way
that would hinder them from carrying out their customs and rites.
   7. What manly reply and appeal did Paul then make? Verses 10, 11.
   NoTE.—All Roman citizens had the right of appeal from the court of a
subordinate judge to the emperor at Rome. In this instance the emperor was
Nero. This provision was a safeguard against the tyranny and oppression of
authorities in lower courts.
   8. What was the governor's official decision? Verse 12.
                 The Visit of Agrippa and Bernice
   9. Who now paid a friendly visit to Festus? Verse 13.
   NoTE.—Agrippa was king of the northern part of Palestine, and adjoining
regions. He was familiar with the teachings and ceremonies of the Jews.
   Agrippa II was the great-grandson of Herod the Great who ordered the
massacre of the children in his effort to destroy the newborn King of the
Jews. Matt. 2:16-18. He was the son of Herod Agrippa I, who put James
to death, and who was smitten by the Lord in this same city of Caesarea.
Acts 12:1, 2, 21-23.
   10. How did Festus introduce Paul's case to King Agrippa? Acts
25 : 14-17.
   11. What did he say of the character of the charges against Paul?
Verses 18, 19.
   12. What did Festus say he had asked Paul? How did he say the trial
had ended?•Verses 20, 21.

    PERSONS: Paul, the aged prisoner; Agrippa and Bernice; Festus; chief captains
and soldiers; principal men of the city.

                           Setting of the Lesson
   "What is going on in the city of Caesarea? Toward the audience chamber
of the Roman governor a great crowd is hastening. Let us enter with them.
Here comes Festus, the governor, and with him are King Agrippa and the
princess, Bernice, all resplendent in royal robes. Festus is clad in scarlet,
Agrippa in royal purple, a golden circlet about his forehead, and Bernice
flashes with jewels. The chief captains and the retinue of soldiers follow,
their helmets and coats of mail and shields and spears glittering, and they
take their stand behind the gilded chairs where sit the governor and his dis-
tinguished guests. After them come all the chief citizens of the city. Soon
afterward a man is led in, chained to two soldiers, and all eyes are turned
upon him. Festus states who the prisoner is, what the charges are against
him, his opinion that he is innocent, and his wish to learn from an examina-
tion before the king what he shall write to the great Roman emperor to whom
the prisoner has asked to be sent for trial. King Agrippa stretches forth his
hand in sign that the prisoner shall speak, and Paul makes his great defense
of his life and conduct."—Tarbell's Teachers' Guide.
                     Paul's Introductory Remarks
  1. After Festus, the governor, had introduced Paul's case, what did
                               l arrest the attention of his SAtdience?
Agrippa say to Paul? How did Pau
Acts 20:1,
                                (28
   NorE.—Not as a guilty criminal cringing before the judge, but as a pleader
for a great cause, the apostle stood before the assembly. His hand, possibly
the one from which a chain was hanging, was stretched forth in a gesture to
command attention, after the manner of the practiced orator.
    2. With what courteous words did Paul begin his address? What gave
him special satisfaction in speaking before Agrippa? Verses 2, 3.
    NOTE.—"The aged prisoner, chained to his soldier guard, had in his
appearance nothing that would lead the world to pay him homage. Yet in
this man, apparently without friends or wealth or position, and held a
prisoner for his faith in the Son of God, all heaven was interested. Angels
were his attendants. Had the glory of one of those shining messengers flashed
 forth, the pomp and pride of royalty would have paled; king and courtiers
 would have been stricken to the earth, as were the Roman guards at the
sepulcher of Christ."—The Acts of the Apostles, pages 434, 435.
    3. What did Paul say regarding his former life in Jerusalem? Verses
4, 5.
                   The Accusation — His Defense
    4. For what did he say he was now being judged? Verses 6, 7.
    NorE.—"He showed how the Old Testament Scriptures had declared that
the Messiah was to appear as a man among men; and how in the life of
Jesus had been fulfilled every specification outlined by Moses and the proph-
ets. For the purpose of redeeming a lost world, the divine Son of God had
endured the cross, despising the shame, and had ascended to heaven trium-
phant over death and the grave."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 436.
    Agrippa having been brought up among the Jews could understand Paul's
argument better than Festus, for he was acquainted with the Scriptures and
the customs of the Jews. Paul had been condemned for teaching that the
Messiah, for whom the Jews were looking, had come. From the time when
Adam was driven from Eden, God's true people had been looking for deliv-
erance from sin. Every sacrifice pointed to Jesus as the Saviour of the world.
The prophets had spoken of His coming. The hope of salvation depended
upon it. This was the blessed "hope of the promise made of God unto our
fathers."
    5. What appeal did Paul make to the king, touching the hope for
which he was on trial and in bonds? Verse 8.
    Nom—The fulfillment of the hope of Israel was dependent upon the
resurrection. Abraham and all the faithful were dead, yet God had promised
an everlasting inheritance to them.                   .
    6. What did Paul say of his former zeal in the Jews' religion? Verses
9-11.
    7. By what experience was he assured that Jesus had risen from' the
dead? Verses 12-15.
    NOTE.—"Why, Paul reasoned, should it seem incredible that Christ should
 rise from the dead? Once it had thus seemed to him; but how could he dis-
believe that which he himself had seen and heard? At the gate of Damascus
he had verily looked upon the crucified and risen Christ, the same who had
walked the streets of Jerusalem, died on Calvary, broken the bands of death,

              Beginning the Voyage to Rome
    SCRIPTURE: Acts 27:1-13.
    MEMORY VERSE: "The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that
fear Him, and delivereth them." Ps. 34:7.
    STUDY HELP: "The Acts of the Apostles," pp. 439-441.
    PLACES: Caesarea; Sidon; the Mediterranean Sea; Fair Havens, a. harbor on
the coast of the island of Crete.
    PERSONS: Paul; Luke and Aristarchus, friends of Paul; Julius, the centurion in
charge of the prisoners ; other prisoners ; soldiers and sailors ; passengers.

                           Setting of the Lesson
   Paul had been kept a prisoner in Caesarea while waiting for a ship to take
him to Rome for trial before Caesar. This lesson portrays some of the ex-
periences of the voyage.
                           A Backward Glance
   1. After three extended missionary trips covering a number of years, to
what city did the apostle to the Gentiles come? Acts 21:15-17.
   2. While taking part in a religious ceremony in the temple, what accu-
sation was made against Paul? How was his life spared? Verses 26-35.
   3. What plot led to his escape from Jerusalem to Caesarea? How did
Claudius Lysias state Paul's case to Felix, the governor? Acts 23:12-14,
25-30.
                                      [ 31 ]
Paul's Journey to Rome
    4. Who accused Paul before Felix? After hearing Paul's defense and
listening to the personal 'appeal made to him, what was the answer of
Felix? Acts 24:2, 22.
    5. Before what ruler did Paul next appear? What decision did Festus
make? Acts 25:12.
    6. Who next heard the defense of the aged prisoner? Verses 22, 23.
    7. What confession did Agrippa make? Acts 26:27, 28.

                                 On to Rome
    9. Who was placed in charge of the company• of prisoners to be sent to
Rome? Who of Paul's friends were with him? Acts 27:1, 2.
    NoTE.—Luke, the writer of the book of Acts, and Aristarchus, a believer
on Jesus from Thessalonica, were Paul's companions on this voyage.
    "One circumstance greatly lightened the hardship of his lot,—he was per-
 mitted the companionship of Luke and Aristarchus. In his letter to the Colos-
sians, heafterward referred to the latter as his 'fellow prisoner;' but it was
 from choice that Aristarchus shared ,Paul's bondage, that he might minister
 to him in his afflictions."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 440.
    Aristarchus had passed through some stirring experiences before this in
 his service with the apostle. Acts 19:28, 29; 20:4, and onward.
     10. What favor was shown Paul at Sidon? Acts 27:3.
     NoTE.—Sidon is one of the oldest cities in the world. The neighborhood,
 possibly the city itself, was visited by Jesus. (See Matt. 15:21; Mark 7:24.)
 Evidently Christian friends were there whom Paul visited at this time.
     11. Why did the boat sail "under Cyprus"? How is the voyage still
 further described? Verses 4, 5.
     12. At what port did they change ships? Verse 6.
     NOTE.—The voyagers to Rome left the ship at Myra, at which port fre-
 quent wheat-laden ships from Egypt arrived en route to Rome. "The second
 ship was a large Egyptian merchantman loaded with grain from Alexandria,
 having on board two hundred and seventy-six persons, besides the freight."
  —Peloubet's Select Notes.
     13. How does Luke describe the voyage to the next port? Verses 7, 8.
     14. What warning accompanied Paul's advice against sailing from Fair
 Havens? Verses 9, 10.
     NoTE.—The "fast" referred to was no doubt the Day of Atonement, and
  came on the tenth day of the seventh month, denoting that it occurred late
  in autumn, when boat travel was becoming dangerous. It was about the
  time of the autumnal equinox.
     "At Fair Havens they were compelled to remain for some time, waiting
  for favoring winds. Winter was approaching rapidly; 'sailing was now dan-
  gerous;' and those in charge of the vessel had to give up hope of reaching
  their destination before the season for travel by sea should be closed for the
  year. The only question now to be decided was, whether to remain at Fair
  Havens, or attempt to reach a more favorable place in which to winter.
     "This question was earnestly discussed, and was finally referred by the
  centurion to Paul, who had won the respect of both sailors and soldiers. The
                                     [ 33 ]
apostle unhesitatingly advised remaining where they were. . . . But 'the
master and the owner of the ship,' and the majority of passengers and crew,
were unwilling to accept this counsel."—The Acts of the Apostles, pages 440,
441.
   15. How was Paul's counsel overruled? Verses 11, 12.
   16. What favorable omen led them to continue the voyage? Verse 13.
                        Think on These Things
   In what ways life is like a sea voyage:
   What experiences of life may be likened to storms?
   Why are these permitted?
   Who may be our captain? What is our compass? To what port are we
seeking entrance?
   What words of cheer may the voyager claim?



                     Lesson 12, for June 21, 1941
                           The Shipwreck
   SCRIPTURE: Acts 27:14-44.
    MEMORY VERSE: "Commit thy way unto the Lord; trust also in Him; and He
shall bring it to pass." Ps. 37:5.
    STUDY HELP: "The Acts of the Apostles," pp. 441-446.
    PLACES: Fair Havens, a small bay near the town of Lasea, midway on the south-
ern coast of Crete.
    PERSONS: Same as inlast lesson; "the angel of God" appeared to Paul.

                          Setting of the Lesson
   Paul was on his way to Rome for trial before Caesar. The season for a sea
voyage was very late. The ship was hindered by contrary winds. They
stopped at Fair Havens, waiting for a favorable opportunity to proceed.
Paul admonished the officials against going farther, but the master and owner
of the ship thought the harbor was not commodious enough for winter quar-
ters, and their advice was taken rather than that of Paul, and when the south
wind blew, they sailed.
                           The Tempest Breaks
   1. What difficulty overtook the ship on which Paul was sailing soon
after they had left Fair Havens? Acts 27:14.
   NOTE.—Euroclydon is from two Greek words which mean "east wind"
and "wave." It means a tempestuous wind at sea.
   2. How does Luke describe the course and handling of the ship in the
tempest? Verses 15-19.
   Nom—The hurricane was so great the ship could not be managed, so it
was driven before the wind. The ship's small boat had been in tow behind,
but now with great difficulty they hoisted it aboard. There was great danger
of the ship's timbers springing apart, thus letting in the water, so ropes were
passed around the ship and drawn tight.
                                     [ 34 )
   The "tackling of the ship"—the loose spars, ropes, chains, etc., Of a ship's
equipment.
   3. What caused the people to give up all hope of being saved? Verse
20.
   NOTE.—The ancient mariners were ignorant of the use of the compass,
but directed their course largely by the position of the heavenly bodies. When
they could not see the sun nor the stars "in many days," they lost hope.
   "Notwithstanding the precautions that had been taken, the vessel leaked.
'The next day they lightened the ship.' Night came again, but the wind did
not abate. The storm-beaten ship, with its shattered mast and rent sails, was
tossed hither and thither by the fury of the gale. Every moment it seemed
that the groaning timbers must give way as the vessel reeled and quivered
under the tempest's shock. The leak increased rapidly, and passengers and
crew worked continually at the pumps.' There was not a moment's rest for
any on board."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 442.

               God Gives Paul a Message of Comfort
    4. In their darkest hour, what cheering message came to the ship's
company through the servant of the Lord? What gentle reproof did Paul
give in connection with his message of cheer? Verses 21, 22.
   5. Who had stood by Paul that night? What would God do for the
sake of His servant Paul? What did Paul say would come to pass? Verses
23-26.
   NorE.—"How calm faith makes us ! We can sleep soundly amid the roar
of the storm and dream of angels when our hearts are stayed on God. His
messengers can cleave their way through the murkiest skies and most drench-
ing storms, to succor those who need their help. What a beautiful confession
that was: 'Whose I am and whom I serve!' Can we all appropriate it? The
first clause is literally true of us all. We belong to Christ by creation and re-
demption. But do we acknowledge His ownership and place our all in His
service?"—F. B. Meyer.
    6. Upon what occasions and under what circumstances had the Lord
previously directed His servant Paul?
   a. At the time of his conversion. Acts 9:3-6.
   b. A man of Macedonia called, Come over and help us. Acts 16:9, 10.
   c. Commanded to remain in Corinth. Acts 18:9-11.
   d. Commanded to depart from Jerusalem. Acts 22:17-21.
   e. Must bear witness in Rome. Acts 23:11.
    7. For how many days did the storm continue unabated? How did the
sailors ascertain that they were nearing land? What precautions were
taken to avoid falling upon the rocks? Verses 27-29.
   NorE.—A fathom is six feet. The measuring line revealed unmistakably
that the ship was nearing land.
    8. What selfish plan did the sailors form? How was their purpose
thwarted? Verses 30-32.
    9. What counsel and assurance did Paul give the ship's company?
What example did Paul set them? Verses 33-36.
    10. How many persons were in the ship? After partaking of food,
 what was next done? Verses 37, 38.

the seamen do? Verses 39, 40.
   12. As the ship was about to go to pieces, what was the advice of the
soldiers? Verses 41, 42.
   NorE.—"The Roman law sanctioned this cruel policy, and the plan
would have been executed at once, but for him to whom all alike were under
deep obligation. Julius the centurion knew that Paul had been instrumental
in saving the lives of all on board; and, moreover, convinced that the Lord
was with him, he feared to do him harm."—The Acts of the Apostles, page
445.
   13. How did the presence of one godly man save the lives of many
others? Verse 43, first part.
   14. What command did the centurion give? How did those who could
not swim get ashore? Verses 43, 44, first part.
   15. What came to pass in fulfillment of the angel's word to Paul?
Verse 44, last part.

                      Lesson 13, for June 28, 1941

        On the Island of Melita (Malta); Paul
         •          Reaches Rome
    SCRIPTURE: Acts 28:1-31.
    MEMORY VERSE: "I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course. I
have kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness."
2 Tim. 4:7, 8.
    STUDY HELP: "The Acts of the Apostles," pp. 445455.
    PLACES: The island of Melita, now known as Malta; a ship of Alexandria, sail-
ing the Mediterranean Sea; the Appian Way; a hired home in the city of Rome.
    PERSONS: Paul and the shipwrecked company; Publius and people on the island
of Melita; friends in Puteoli; friends from Rome; captain of the guard in Rome; Jews
in Rome.         .
                           Setting of the Lesson
   A company of prisoners, including the apostle Paul, under charge of
Julius, a centurion to whom Festus had committed Paul, were traveling by
sea from Caesarea to Rome. Encountering a severe storm lasting many days,
the ship was finally wrecked, but all on board reached near-by land, and
were saved.
                     From Malta to Puteoli, Italy
   1. To what island did Paul and the shipwrecked company escape?
Acts 28:1.
   NOTE.—The modern name is Malta. It is sixty miles from the island of
Sicily, and two hundred from the African coast. A bay on the north side of
the island, where it is supposed the party landed, has been named St. Paul's
Bay.
   2. How were they treated by the people on the island? Verse 2.
   NOTE.—To the Greeks, all were "barbarians" who did not speak Greek.
The kindness shown by the islanders was repaid later in blessings.
   3. What service did Paul render? Verse 3.
   4. What change in the attitude of the people of the island was caused
by Paul's experience with the viper? Verses 4-6.
   5. Who had quarters in-this part of the island? What courtesy did he
show Paul and his friends? What blessing came to the hospitable Publius?
Verses 7, 8.
   6. What followed this manifestation of God's power? How did the
islanders generally treat the party? Verses 9, 10.
    7. How long did the entire company remain on the island? What ship
had wintered there? What was its sign or name? Verse 11.
   NOTE.-Such signs were used because many could not read. Castor and
Pollux were supposed to be the twin sons of Jupiter. November, December,
and January evidently had been spent on the island, and early in February
the Alexandrian grain ships were again moving toward Italy.
    8. What course did they now follow in their journey? Verses 12, 13.
    N0TE.—"Fetched a compass." Compasses as we know them were not used
in this time. The Revised Version says, "made a circuit," while the marginal
                                       [ 37 )
reading says, "cast loose." The thought doubtless is that they left the port
of Syracuse and sailed circuitously to Puteoli.
   Syracuse was the great port of Sicily, and at Rhegium, at the toe of the
Italian boot, the apostle first touched Italy. The company landed at Puteoli,
on the present Bay of Naples. It was 133 miles from there to Rome.

             Paul Meets Brethren — Proceeds to Rome
    9. Where and for how long was Paul permitted to tarry with friends?
Verse 14.
    10. Who came to meet him at Appii Forum? How did this meeting with
the brethren from Rome affect the apostle? Verse 15.
    NOTE.—"On the eighth day after landing, the centurion and his prisoners
set out for Rome. Julius willingly granted the apostle every•favor which it
was in his power to bestow; but he could not change his condition as a pris-
oner, or release him from the chain that bound him to, his soldier guard. It
was with a heavy heart that Paul went forward to his long-expected visit
to the world's metropolis. How different the circumstances from those he
had anticipated ! How was he, fettered and stigmatized, to proclaim the
gospel? His hopes of winning many souls to the truth in Rome, seemed des-
tined to disappointment.
    "At last the travelers reach Appii Forum, forty miles from Rome. As they
make their way through the crowds that throng the great thoroughfare, the
gray-haired old man, chained with a group of hardened-looking criminals,
receives many a glance of scorn, and is made the subject of many a rude,
mocking jest.
    "Suddenly a cry of joy is heard, and a man springs from the passing
throng and falls upon the prisoner's neck, embracing him with tears and re-
joicing, as a son would welcome a long-absent father. . . .
    "As the warm-hearted disciples eagerly flock around their father in the
gospel, the whole company is brought to a standstill. The soldiers are im-
patient of delay, yet they have not the heart to interrupt this happy meeting;
for they too have learned to respect and esteem their prisoner."—The Acts
of the Apostles, pages 448, 449.
    11. When delivered by Julius to the Roman guard, how was Paul
treated differently from other prisoners? Verse 16.
    NoTE.—"Paul was treated in Rome with the utmost leniency. He was al-
lowed to hire a house or a lodging in the city and live there at his own con-
venience under the surveillance of a soldier who was responsible for his pres-
ence when required. A light chain fastened Paul's wrist to that of the soldier.
No hindrance was offered to his inviting friends into his house, or to his
 preaching to all who came in to him; but he was not allowed to go out
 freely."—Ramsay.
                    Paul Preaches Christ in Rome
   12. How soon after reaching Rome did Paul call a meeting of the lead-
ing Jews at Rome? What were the main points in his first talk with them?
Verses 17-20.
   NoTE.—"After three days for getting settled and rested, Paul called to-
gether the Jewish leaders and officers of the synagogues 'of which there were
seven in Rome.' . . .
                                    1383
   "His object was to explain (1) how he came to be a prisoner, so that they
would see that he was no criminal; (2) to correct any false reports from the
Jews at Jerusalem; (3) to gain an opportunity 'of preaching the gospel to
them. . . .
   "He showed (1) that he was a true, loyal, patriotic Jew; (2) that he had
been pronounced innocent by the Roman court; but (3) he had been com-
pelled by opposition to appeal to Caesar for his own safety; (4) that he made
no accusations against his countrymen; (5) that he wished to tell them the
good news that the expected Messiah, in whom all the Jews rested their hopes,
had actually come."—Peloubet's Select Notes.
   13. What information concerning Paul's case had these Jews failed to
receive? What reason did they give for desiring to hear his message?
Verses 21, 22.
   NorE.—"Many of the Jews who had been banished from Rome some years
previously, had been allowed to return, so that large numbers were now to
be found there. To these, first of all, Paul determined to present the facts
concerning himself and his work, before his enemies should have oppor-
tunity to embitter them against him."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 450.
   14. How did the apostle take advantage of this opening?, What two
classes of hearers were there? Verses 23, 24.
   15. When Paul saw that many of these Jews would not believe even as
the Jews in Jerusalem would not, what did he quote from Isaiah, the
prophet? Verses 25-27.
   16. In closing, what solemn declaration did the apostle make? After
the Jews had left Paul, what did they continue to do? Verses 28, 29.
   17. How long did Paul remain a prisoner in Rome at this time? How
did he continue to carry on his work? Verses 30, 31.
   NorE.—Paul spent two busy years in his own hired house preaching the
gospel and writing letters to the churches.
   His trial before Nero (Roman Caesar) was delayed these two years by the
failure of his accusers to present themselves. This delay resulted in the fur-
therance of the gospel.
                       The End of the Journey
   All authorities agree that Paul was acquitted when tried by Nero at the
end of the two years, although Jews from Jerusalem appeared against him.
When free, he visited some of the churches he had raised up. Later, he was
again arrested and taken to Rome, and this time placed in a dungeon. At the
command of Nero, he was taken in a private manner to •the place of execu-
tion, and was beheaded. He was so courageous that the soldiers who at-
tended him were filled with wonder. Almost the last words this great apostle
wrote were the words of the memory verse in this day's lesson.
   Of Paul's last moments we read: "As he stands at. the place of martyrdom,
he sees not the sword of the executioner or the earth so soon to receive his
blood; he looks up through the calm blue 'heaven of that summer day to the
throne of the Eternal. . . . His mind grasps the Saviour'g.g promise, will
raise him up at the last day.' His thoughts and hopes are centered on the
second coming of his Lord. And as the sword of the executioner descends, and
the shadows of death gather about the martyr, his latest thought springs for-
ward, as will his earliest in the great awakening, to meet the Life-giver, who
shall welcome him to the joy of the blest."—The Acts of the Apostles, pages
511-513.

BURMA
   When the Silver Jubi-
lee Offering was taken
in 1937. the Southern
Asia Division was the
recipient of $10,000: in 1939, when the•Thirteenth
Sabbath Offering was devoted to this same divi-
sion, the overflow amounted to $7,457.37. We
rejoice that our Sabbath school members have
so generously given of their means in the past
to help in the mission work of this field.
   On Sabbath, June 28. we have another golden
opportunity to give to Southern Asia. The over-
flow is dedicated to medical missionary work         V
