       Lessons From the Days of the Patriarchs and Prophets


    FROM SAUL'S DISOBEDIENCE to the
  DESTRUCTION of the PROPHETS of BAAL


                        Lesson 1, for January 1, 1944

      Saul's Disobedience and Its Consequences
     MEMORY VERSE: "Samuel said, Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offer-
ings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than
sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams." 1 Sam. 15:22.
     STUDY HELP: "Patriarchs and Prophets," pages 626-636.

               Saul Is Told to Destroy Amalek
   1. When Saul had been king for some years, what command
came to him concerning Amalek? 1 Sam. 15:1-3.
    NOTE.—The Amalekites dwelt in Arabia between the Dead Sea arid the Red
Sea. They were a roving people living in caves or in tents. The Israelites had
scarcely passed the Red Sea when the powerful Amalekites made an unpro-
voked assault upon them. God therefore decreed their extermination. Ex. 17:
16, margin.
   "For four hundred years the execution of this sentence had been deferred;
but the Amalekites had not turned from their sins. The Lord knew that this
wicked people would, if it were possible, blot out His people and His worship
from the earth. Now the time had come for the sentence, so long delayed, to
be executed."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 628.


     2. How large a force did Saul gather for this purpose? What
special consideration was shown the Kenites, and why? 1 Sam. 15:
4-6.     •
    NoTE.—"While inflicting judgment, God remembered mercy. The Amalek-
ites were to be destroyed, but the Kenites, who dwelt among them, were
spared. This people, though not wholly free from idolatry, were worshipers of
God, and were friendly to Israel. Of this tribe was the brother-in-law of Moses,
Hobab, who had accompanied the Israelites in their travels through the wilder-
ness, and by his knowledge of the country had rendered them valuable assist-
ance."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 628.


   3. To what extent were the Amalekites defeated? Who was
spared, and what portion of the spoil, was saved? Verses 7-9.
                                         1$ ]
    4. What message from the Lord came to Samuel? How did it
affect the prophet? Verses 10, 11.

               Samuel's Message of Reproof
    5. When Samuel met Saul, how did the king greet him? Verses
12, 13.
     NOTE.—To mark his victory over Amalek, Saul had "set him up a place,"
'that is, he had erected a triumphal monument at Carmel, a city in Judah.
 What in his delusion he considered a great success, actually proved to be a
 moral defeat of unexpected consequence, which ultimately brought about his
 fall.
     "When the first step is taken in the path of transgression, the way becomes
Deasy. Saul, debased by his disobedience, came to meet Samuel with a lie upon
this lips. He exclaimed, 'Blessed be thou of the Lord; I have performed the
'commandment of the Lord.'"—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 630.


   6. What searching question did Samuel ask? How did Saul ex-
cuse his course of action? Verses 14, 15.

    7. Unwilling to admit his guilt, what bold assertion proves Saul's
stubbornness? Upon whom is the blame for his failure shifted?
Verses 20, 21. Compare verses 8, 9.
   NOTE.—"Thus Saul transformed what was to have been a sacred war into
a common freebooting expedition such as the heathen tribes had so often made
against Israel. No wonder that Jehovah condemned Saul, and no wonder that
Samuel was filled with grief and dismay, crying to the Lord with an all-night
intercession for the self-willed monarch."—Peloubet.


    8. What is God's test of true religion? Verse 22.

   9. To what are rebellion and stubbornness compared? What
was the result of Saul's open disobedience? Verse 23.

                        Saul Entreats Samuel
    10. Alarmed at this sentence, what changed attitude did Saul
take? Verses 24, 25.
   NOTE.—"Terrified by the denunciation of the prophet, Saul acknowledged
 his guilt, which he had before stubbornly denied; but he still persisted in cast-
 ing blame upon the people, declaring that he had sinned through fear of them.
     "It was not sorrow for sin, but fear of its penalty, that actuated the king
 of Israel as he entreated Samuel, 'I pray thee, pardon my sin,4a,nd turn'again
 with me, that I may worship the Lord.' If Saul had,had tripe repentance, he
-would have made public confession of his sin; but it was his chief anxiety to
                                      t 4]
maintain his authority, and retain the allegiance of the people. He desired the
honor of Samuel's presence in order to strengthen his own influence with the
nation."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 631.



    11. How did Saul attempt to overcome Samuel's unwillingness
to return with him? With what result? Verses 26, 27.


   12. How was the tense situation further aggravated by this inci-
dent? Verses 28, 29.



     13. What acknowledgment was finally made by Saul? How did
this affect Samuel's decision? Verses 30,- 31.
    NoTE.—It was the fear of losing the royal crown that he felt tottering as a
result of the condemnation of the Lord's prophet, rather than genuine repent-
ance for his sin and concern for the salvation of his soul, that prompted Saul
to approach Samuel as an apparently humble suppliant.
    "How was he [Saul] suited for the post of theocratic king who set popular-
ity above duty? He still felt no sorrow for the sin itself; he grieved only for
its consequences, present and future. He saw that this public rupture between
himself and the great and honored prophet would diminish his authority and
do him irreparable mischief; so he begged Samuel not to desert him at this
crisis."—William J. Deane, Samuel and Saul, pages 154, 155.


    14. Saul having failed, what instruction from'the Lord did Sam-
uel carry out? Verses 32, 33.
   NOTE.—"An act of justice, stern and terrible, was yet to be performed.
Samuel must publicly vindicate the honor of God, and rebuke the course of
Saul. He commanded that the king of the Amalekites be brought before him.
Above all who had fallen by the sword of Israel, Agag was the most guilty
and merciless; one who had hated and sought to destroy the people of God,
and whose influence had been strongest to promote idolatry."—Patriarchs and
Prophets, page 632.


    15. How did Samuel further relate himself to Saul? What is
said of the Lord's attitude? Verses 34, 35.
   NoTE.—Samuel's mourning for Saul may be called the human expression of
the divine sorrow over the loss of this first king of the Lord's choice. While
Samuel, the prophet, had to sever his relation with Saul as king, except for an
incidental meeting at the school of the prophets at Naioth in Ramah (1 Sam.
19:22-24), he could not suppress his human sympathy for the rejected king
with whom he had been associated all these years in service for Israel.
                                     [5]
                     Lesson 2, for January 8, 1944
             David Is Called to the Kingdom
    MEMORY VERSE: "The Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the
outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart." 1 Sam. 16:7.
    STUDY HELP: "Patriarchs and Prophets," pages 637-642.

               Samuel Is Directed to Bethlehem
  1. What effect did Saul's failure and rejection have on Samuel?
What provision had the Lord made for a successor? 1 Sam. 16:1.


  2. How was Samuel instructed to avoid the suspicion of Saul?
What took place when he arrived at Bethlehem? Verses 2-5.
    NorE.—"Samuel's break with Saul was doubtless well known, and these
elders feared that they would anger the king if they welcomed the prophet.
Besides, probably Samuel sometimes visited towns that harbored iniquities, for
the purpose of denouncing them, and the elders feared that in some way Beth-
lehem had incurred the divine wrath."—Peloubet.


    3. Which of Jesse's sons first caught the eye of Samuel? How
did the Lord correct his opinion? Verses 6, 7.
    NOTE.—"No outward beauty can recommend the soul to God. The wisdom
and excellence revealed in the character and deportment, express the true
beauty of the man; and it is the inner worth, the excellency of the heart, that
determines our acceptance with the Lord of hosts. How deeply should we feel
this truth in the judgment of ourselves and othefs. We may learn, from the
mistake of Samuel, how vain is the estimation that rests on beauty of face or
nobility of stature. We may see how incapable is man's wisdom of under-
standing the secrets of the heart, or of comprehending the counsels of God,
without special enlightenment from heaven."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page
638.


    4. What did Jesse proceed to do? How many of his sons failed
to meet the test? Verses 8-10.

                   David the Lord's Choice
. 5. What question did Samuel ask? On what did he insist?
Verse 11.

   6. As David was brought in, how was Samuel assured that he
was the Lord's choice? Verse 12.
                                     [6]
     7. What solemn ceremony was then performed? Verse 13, first
part.
    NOTE.—" 'Now he [David] was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful counte-
nance, and goodly to look 10.' As Samuel beheld with pleasure the handsome,
manly, modest shepherd boy, the voice of the Lord spoke to the prophet, say-
ing, 'Arise, anoint him; for this is he.' David had proved himself brave and
faithful in the humble office of a shepherd, and now God had chosen him to be
captain of His people. 'Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him
in the midst of [from among] his brethren; and the Spirit of the Lord came
upon David from that day forward' The prophet had accomplished his ap-
pointed work, and with a relieved heart he returned to Ramah.
    "Samuel had not made known his errand, even to the family of Jesse, and
the ceremony of anointing David had been performed in secret. It was an
intimation to the youth of the high destiny awaiting him, that amid all the
varied experiences and perils of his coming years, this knowledge might inspire
him to be true to the purpose of God to be accomplished by his life."—Patri-
archs and Prophets, page 641.

     8. How is the transition of divine favor from Saul to David
made significantly evident? Verses 13, last part, 14.
    NoTE.—"When King Saul realized that he had been rejected by God, and
when he felt the force of the words of denunciation that had been addressed to
him by the prophet, he was filled with bitter rebellion and despair. It was not
true repentance that had bowed the proud head of the king. He had no clear
perception of the offensive character of his sin, and did not arouse to the work
of reforming his life, but brooded over what he thought was the injustice of
God in depriving him of the throne of Israel, and in taking the succession away
from his posterity. He was ever occupied in anticipating the ruin that had been
brought upon his house. He felt that the valor which he had displayed in en-
countering his enemies, should offset his sin of disobedience. He did not accept
with meekness the chastisement of God; but his haughty spirit became des-
perate, until he was on the verge of losing his reason."—Patriarchs and Proph-
ets, page 643.

              David Ministers at the Court of Saul
   9. Review the circumstances that brought David in contact with
the royal court. Verses 15-23.


     10. What statement reveals Saul's attitude toward David? Verse
21.
    NOTE.—"The armor-bearer, like the esquire in the Middle Ages, had to carry
his lord's lance, and sword, and shield, and was always a tried soldier, and one
whom the king trusted."—Pulpit Commentary, vol. 1, p. 298.

   11. What is said of David's occupation following his anointing?
1 Sam. 17:15.
                                       7
    Nom.—"Now David went to and fro from Saul," according to the Revised
Version.
    "Notwithstanding the high position which he was to occupy, he quietly
continued his employment, content to await the development of the Lord's
plans in His own time and way. As humble and modest as before his anoint-
ing, the shepherd boy returned to the hills, and watched and guarded his flocks
as tenderly as ever. But with new inspiration he composed his melodies, and
played upon his harp. . . .
    "Who can measure the results of those years of toil and wandering among
the lonely hills? The communion with nature and with God, the care of his
flocks, the perils and deliverances, the griefs and joys, of his lowly lot, were
not only to mold the character of David, and to influence his future life, but
through the psalms of Israel's sweet singer, they were, in all coming ages, to
kindle love and faith in the hearts of God's people, bringing them nearer to the
ever-loving heart of Him in whom all His creatures live."—Patriarchs and
Prophets, pages 641, 642.



     12. Which of th" psalms did David compose during these stir-
ring years before he became king?
    Answer: About half the psalms are ascribed to David. "It is to this period
of inward and spiritual preparation [before he became king] in solitary com-
munion with God that we trace the first of those psalms which have forever
made 'the sweet singer,' in a sense, the 'shepherd' of all spiritual Israel. And
here also we love to connect the plains and the shepherds of Bethlehem, who
heard angels hymning the birth of our dear Lord, with His great ancestor and
type, and to think how in those very plains the shepherd king may have
watched his flock in the quiet of the starlit night, and poured forth in accents
of praise what is the faith and hope of the church in all times."—Alfred Eder-
sheim, Israel Under Samuel, Saul, and David, page 85.



                      Lesson 3, for January 15, 1944

                         David and Goliath
     MEMORY VERSE: "All this assembly shall know that the Lord saveth not with
sword and spear: for the battle is the Lord's, and He will give you into our hands."
l Sam. 17:47.
     STUDY HELPS: "Patriarchs and Prophets," pages 643-648; "Testimonies," vol.
3, pp. 218, 219.

                         Goliath Challenges Israel
    1. With whom was Israel at war? What was the arrangement of
the two opposing camps? 1 Sam. 17:1-3.
    NOTE.—The Philistines were a warlike people who harassed and oppressed
Israel from the early days of the judges. They were among the nations left in
Canaan "to prove Israel." Judges 3:1, 3. Gaza, Ashkelon, and Ashdod were
their chief cities. They have given Palestine its name to this day.
                                      s
    2. Who was the champion of the Philistines? How is he de-
scribed? 1 Sam. 17:4-7.

   3. What challenge did he make to the hosts of Israel? Verses 8-10.

    4. What effect did this challenge have upon Israel? Verse 11.

    5. How long did Goliath thus defy their armies? Verse 16.

                 David Is Aroused to Action
    6. Upon what errand was David sent? By whom? Verses 17,
18, 20.
   NOTE.—"Unknown to Jesse, the youthful shepherd had been entrusted with
a higher mission. The armies of Israel were in peril, and David had been
directed by an angel to save his people."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 645.


    7. What took place while David talked with his brethren? How
did the Philistine's challenge affect him? Verses 23-26.
   NOTE.—"When David saw that all Israel were filled with fear, and learned
that the Philistine's defiance was hurled at them day after day, without arous-
ing a champion to silence the boaster, his spirit was stirred within him. He
was fired with zeal to preserve the honor of the living God and the credit of
His people."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 645.


    8. How was David reproved by his eldest brother? What spirit
did he continue to show? Verses 28-30.
    NoTE.—"Even as a shepherd, David had manifested daring, courage, and
strength but rarely witnessed; and the mysterious visit of Samuel to their
father's house, and his silent departure, had awakened in the minds of the
brothers suspicions of the real object of his visit."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
page 645.

   9. To whose ears did David's words come? When brought be-
fore Saul, what courageous words did he speak? What was Saul's
reply? Verses 31-33.

  10. In telling Saul of his past exploits, whom did David acknowl-
edge as his deliverer? How did his confidence regarding Goliath
inspire Saul? Verse 34-37.
                                     [9)
    NOTE.—"No one but himself had looked upon it in the right light, as a con-
flict between light and darkness, truth and error, religion and idolatry. The
providence of God had led him so to view it; and he rose to the occasion, rest-
ing his cause on the succor of Him in knowledge of whom the being and con-
tinuance of Israel were bound up."—Wm. J. Deane, David, His Life and Times,
page 18.


                     David Brings Victory to Israel
    11. Describe the effort made to protect David in his combat with
the giant. Why could he not use Saul's armor? Verses 38, 39.
   NOTE.—"David, in his humility and zeal for God and his people, proposed
to meet this boaster. Saul consented, and had his own kingly armor placed.
upon David. But he would not consent to wear it. He laid off the king's
armor; for he had not proved it. He had proved God, and, in trusting in Him,
had gained special victories. To put on Saul's armor would give the impression
that he was a warrior, when he was only little David, who tended the sheep.
He did not mean that any credit should be given to the armor of Saul; for his
trust was in the Lord God of Israel."—Testimonies, vol. 3, p. 219.


   12. What striking contrast appeared in the equipment of these
two champions as they met for battle? Verses 4-7, 40.


   13. With what defiant words did Goliath approach David?
Verses 43, 44.


    14. What reply did David make? What did he greatly desire that
the whole world should learn from this conflict? Verses 45-47.
    NOTE.—"There was a ring of fearlessness in his [David's] tone, a look of
triumph and rejoicing upon his fair countenance. This speech, given in a clear,
musical voice, rang out on the air, and was distinctly heard by the listening
thousands marshaled for war. The anger of Goliath was roused to the very
highest heat. In his rage he pushed up the helmet that protected his forehead,
and rushed forward to wreak vengeance upon his opponent."—Patriarchs and
Prophets, page 648.


    15. Mark the various steps of this personal combat. What was
the result? Verses 48-51.


   16. How did the Lord vindicate David's confidence in Him?
Verses 51, last part, 52-54.
                             [10l
                     Lesson 4, for January 22, 1944

                          David a Fugitive
      MEMORY VERSE: "I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth
all things for me." Ps. 57:2.
      STUDY HELP: "Patriarchs and Prophets," pages 649-659.

            David's Success Arouses Saul's Jealousy
   1. After David had slain Goliath, what information did Saul
seek concerning him? 1 Sam. 17:55-58.


     2. What friendship was formed while David thus stood before
the king? 1 Sam. 18:1-4.
    NorE.—"We can imagine how a spirit so generous as that of Jonathan
would be drawn toward that unaffected, brave youth, so free from all self-
consciousness or self-seeking, who would seem the very embodiment of Israel-
itish valor and piety. And we can equally perceive how gratitude and admira-
tion of such real nobleness would kindle in the heart of David an affection
almost womanly in its tenderness. Ancient history records not a few instances
of such love between heroes, ratified like this by a 'covenant,' and betokened
by such gifts as when Jonathan put on David his 'mantle,' his 'armor coat,'
and even his arms,—but none more pure and elevated, or penetrated, as in this
instance, by the highest and best feelings of true piety."—Alfred Edersheim,
 Israel Under Samuel, Saul, and David, pages 94, 95.

    3. What was said of David's conduct? To what position was he
promoted? How was he regarded by the people and by Saul's serv-
ants? Verse 5.
   Nora.—"It was the providence of God that had connected David with Saul.
David's position at court would give him a knowledge of affairs, in preparation
for his future greatness. It would enable him to gain the confidence of the
nation. The vicissitudes and hardships which befell him, through the enmity
of Saul, would lead him to feel his dependence upon God, and to put his whole
trust in Him. And the friendship of Jonathan for David was also of God's
providence, to preserve the life of the future ruler of Israel. In all these things,
God was working out His gracious purposes, both for David and for the people
of Israel."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 649.

    4. What incident aroused Saul's envy against David? How was
this manifested? Verses 6-9.
    NoTE.—"One great defect in the character of Saul was his love of approba-
tion. This trait had had a controlling influence over his actions and thoughts;
everything was marked by his desire for praise and self-exaltation. His stand-
ard of right and wrong was the low standard of popular applause. No man is
safe who lives that he may please men, and does not seek first for the appro-
bation of God."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 650.
                                      [ 11 )
     5. Review Saul's attempt on David's life, and his plots to rid
himself of David. Verses 10-30. Note last part of verses 17, 25.
• NoTE.—"Saul's dark passions were ultimately concentrated in the one
thought of murder. Yet in reality it was against Jehovah that he contended
rather than against David. So true is it that all sin is ultimately against the
Lord; so bitter is the root of self; and so terrible the power of evil in its con-
stantly growing strength, till it casts out all fear of God or care for man. . . .
These constant unprovoked attempts upon the life of David, regardless of the
means employed, till at last the whole forces of the kingdom were used for no
other purpose than to hunt down an innocent fugitive, whose only crime was
that God was with him, and that he had successfully fought the cause of Israel,
must have had a very detrimental effect upon the people. They must have
convinced all that he who now occupied the throne was unfit for the post"—
Alfred Edersheim, Israel Under Samuel, Saul, and David, page 96.


           David's Flight—His Providential Protection
   6. What further circumstances led to David's flight? Where did
he go in his distress? 1 Sam. 19:9118.



    7. How was God's protection over David again made manifest
to Saul? Verses 20-24.
   Nora.—"An angel of God met him [Saul] on themay, and controlled him.
The Spirit of God held him in its power, and he went forward uttering prayers
to God, interspersed with predictions and sacred melodies."—Patriarchs and
Prophets, page 654.


  8. Weary of his fugitive life, whose counsel did David seek?
What assurance was given him? 1 Sam. 20:1-4.



    9. Describe the plans of Jonathan and David. Verses 11-23.



    10. What events shattered all hopes of a reconciliation with
Saul? Verses 24-42.
    NoTE.—"His [Jonathan's] soul was bowed down with sorrow, as he re-
paired, at the appointed time, to the spot where David was to learn the king's
intentions toward him. Each fell upon the other's neck, and they wept bitterly.
The dark passion of the king cast its shadow upon the life of the young men,
and their grief was too intense for expression, Jonathan's last words fell upon
the ear of David as they separated to pursue their different paths."—Patriarchs
and ProPhets, page 655.

                Human Weaknesses Are Revealed
   11. Where do we next find David? How did he conceal his real
condition from the alarmed priest? 1 Sam. 21:1, 2.


     12. Who also was present at the tabernacle at this time? What
were the tragic consequences? 1 Sam. 21:7; 22:9-19. See 1 Sam. 22:
20-22 as showing David's remorse.
    NOTE.—"Here he [David] manifested a want of faith in God, and his sin
resulted in causing the death of the high priest. Had the facts been plainly
stated, Ahimelech would have known what course to pursue to preserve his
life. God requires that truthfulness shall mark His people, even in the greatest
peril."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 656.
    Ahimelech "was a man of a timid nature, not inclined to risk offending the
imperious monarch under whose protection he lived. Knowing this man's
character, and fearing that if he appeared as a fugitive from the vengeance of
Saul, the priest would decline to receive him or to supply his pressing wants,—
food and arms,—David had recourse to a subterfuge, which, while it answered
his immediate purpose, was the cause of a terrible calamity to the innocent
community at Nob, and of the bitterest sorrow to himself."—William J. Deane,
 David, His Life and Times, page 41.


    13. Seeing that he was discovered, with whom did David seek
refuge? What did he pretend in order to save his life? 1 Sam. 21:
10-15.

     14. To what places did David further flee, and who were with
him? 1 Sam. 22:1-5.
    NoTE.—"When estimating David's character, the soreness, the meanness of
his trials must be taken into account. He was made an outlaw, with only a
band of outlaws as his followers—brave, but unscrupulous. The daily fret of
it was enough to wear out the finest temper and the kindest spirit. There were
signs that once or twice David's better qualities almost gave way in the long,
unheroic struggle. Hunted from cave to cave, betrayed for any price by any
evil-disposed passer-by, his own generous impulses met on Saul's part with
studied bad faith—the wonder is that he was not swept by a flood of angry pas-
sion into infamy."—H. Elvet Lewis, Men of the Old Testament, pages 292, 293.


    15. How has David given expression to his trust in God during
these afflictions? Psalm 57.

                   Tokens of Divine Favor
   1. How was David enabled to seek counsel of the Lord? 1 Sam.
22:20, 21; 23:1-6.


     2. What was Saul's plan when David was shut up at Keilah?
How did David again inquire of the Lord? Verses 7-12.
    NoTE.—"The breastplate was of the same material as the ephod. It was in
the form of a square and measured a span. In it were set in gold twelve pre-
cious stones, arranged in a row. On each stone was engraved the name
of one of the tribes of Israel. Around these was a border of a variety of stones.
The stones in the breastplate were the same as those that form the foundation
of the New Jerusalem. The breastplate hung from the shoulders of the ephod
and was fastened at the waist by a blue cord through gold rings.
    "Set in the breastplate, one on either side, were two brilliant stones, called
the Urim and Thummin. By means of these stones the mind of the Lord
could be ascertained by the high priest. When questions were asked, if light
encircled the precious stone at the right, the answer was in the affirmative;
but if a shadow rested on the stone at the left, the answer was negative.
    "The breastplate being attached to the ephod, David, in calling for the
priest to bring the ephod when he was undecided as to what course to pursue,
was really asking for the breastplate, by which he might know the mind of
the Lord."—S. N. Haskell, The Cross and Its Shadow, pages 87, 88.


   3. What was the cause of Saul's failures to capture David?
Verses 13-15.


     4. What encouraging experience came to David in the wood of
Ziph? Verses 16-18.
    NOTE.—"At this time, when there were so few bright spots in the path of
David, he was rejoiced to receive an unexpected visit from Jonathan, who had
learned the place of his refuge. Precious were the moments which these two
friends passed in each other's society. They related their varied experiences,
and Jonathan strengthened the heart of David. . . . As they talked of the
wonderful dealings of God with David, the hunted fugitive was greatly en-
couraged."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 660.


   5. Review the further efforts made by Saul toipprehend David.
To what places did David flee? Verses 19-29.

                   David Spares Saul's Life
   6. How did Saul unknowingly place himself in David's power?
What did David's men suggest, and what did he venture to do?
1 Sam. 24:1-4.


   7. How was David's conscience aroused following his action?
Verses 5-7.

   8. In his appeal to Saul, what evidence did David give of his
loyalty to Saul, the king? Verses 8-15.


   9. Moved by sudden emotion, how did Saul acknowledge David's
innocence and his own guilt? What request did he make? Verses
16-22.

   10. At this time, what great leader in Israel passed away? How
was he regarded by the people? 1 Sam. 25:1.                     •
   Nom.—"The death of Samuel was regarded as an irreparable loss by the
nation of Israel. A great and good prophet and an eminent judge had fallen in
death; and the grief of the people was deep and heartfelt. From his youth up,
Samuel had walked before Israel in the integrity of his heart; although Saul
had been the acknowledged king, Samuel had wielded a more powerful influ-
ence than he, because his record was one of faithfulness, obedience, and devo-
tion. We read that be judged Israel all the days of his life. . . .
    "It was when the nation was racked with internal strife, when the calm,
God-fearing counsel of Samuel seemed to be most needed, that God gave His
aged servant rest. Bitter were the reflections of the people as they looked upon
his quiet resting place, and remembered their folly in rejecting him as their
ruler;.for he had had so close a connection with Heaven that he seemed to
bind all Israel to the throne of Jehovah."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pages
663, 664.

                      Abigail's Wise Course
   11. What provoking attitude was shown by Nabal to David's
considerate request? Verses 2-12.


   12. Describe how a servant intervened, and how Abigail wisely
proceeded to avert the impending crisis. Verses 18-31.
   Nora.—"Where such services were accepted and counted upon, it was
obviously fair, and, indeed, according to the custom of the time, that some
recompense in kind should be Made. It was a tacit understanding, an unwritten
                                     ( 15 ]
law; and David was perfectly justified in sending ten young men to greet the
opulent sheepmaster Nabal in the day of prosperity, to which the exertions of
himself and his men had so largely contributed, to remind him of his obliga-
tions and ask whatsoever might come readily to his hand to give. Nabal's
churlish treatment of this request touched David to the quick, and led up to an
incident which, as recorded by the sacred historian, is one of the most charm-
ing idyls of Scripture, fragrant as the flowers of Alpine pastures, and fresh as
a summer morn."—F. B. Meyer, David: Shepherd, Psalmist, King, page 126.



    13. How did David view Abigail's advice? Verses 32, 33, 35.


    14. After the death of Nabal, what did David do? What wives
did he now have? Verses 39-43.
   NOTE.—"David afterward married Abigail. He was already the husband
of one wife; but the custom of the nations of his time had perverted his judg-
ment and influenced his actions. Even great and good men have erred in fol-
lowing the practices of the world. The bitter result of marrying many wives
was sorely felt throughout all the life of David."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
page 668.



                   Saul Again in David's Power
    15. In what manner was Saul again delivered into the hands of
David? How did David reason with Abishai, and what did he do?
1 Sam. 26:1-12.
   NoTE.—"It is not by our own hands that we are to be freed from our
wrongs, nor is every opportunity to attain our aims, whatever they be, God-
sent. ere
        h is ever the prior question of plain duty, with which nothing else,
however tempting or promising of success,can come into conflict; and such
reasons may be only those when our faith and ;patience are put on trial, so as
to bring it clearly before us, whether or not, quite irrespective of all else, we
are content to leave everything in the hands of God. And David conquered,
as long afterwards his great Antitype overcame the tempter, by steadfast ad-
herence to God's known will and ordinance."—Alfred Edersheim, Israel Under
Samuel, Saul, and David, pages 126, 127.


   16. How was Saul informed of the danger that had threatened
him? What confession did he make? Verses 13-22.


   17. What course had David been urged to follow? In whom,
however, did he continue to plate his trust ? Vetises 19,.24; Psalth 54.

Thy right hand hath holden me up, and Thy gentleness hath made me great." Ps. 18:35.

                  David Anointed King of Judah
    1. Following his lament over the death of Saul and Jonathan
(2 Sam. 1:17-27), where was David directed to go? By whom was he
called to the throne? 2 Sam. 2:1-4.
   NOTE.—"David was thirty years old when he began to reign." 2 Sam. 5:4.


    2. How did David commend the men of Jabesh-gilead for their
kindness? 2 Sam. 2:5-7.
   NOTE.—This was a wise and noble gesture. Praising them for their act of
mercy 'on behalf of the mutilated body of the king, who was his bitter enemy,
could not fail to make a favorable impression, and to win for himself the love
and sympathy of a large section of the people. It was a good beginning of his
reign. A ruler who, under circumstances such as David had experienced, ac-
knowledged the qualities of his predecessor who had been his bitter enemy,
gives evidence of his qualification for the throne.


     3. What procedure reveals the wide separation that existed be-
tween the followers of Saul and David? Verses 8-10.
    NOTE.—"Ish-bosheth was but a weak and incompetent representative of the
house of Saul, while David was pre-eminently qualified to bear the responsi-
bilities of the kingdom. Abner, the chief agent in raising Ish-bosheth to kingly
power had been commander in chief of Saul's army, and was the most dis-
       '
tinguished   man in Israel. Abner knew that David had been appointed by the
Lord to the throne of Israel, but having so long hunted and pursued him, he
was not now willing that the son of Jesse should succeed to the kingdom over
which' Saul had reigned. . . .
    "Mahanaim, on the farther side of Jordan, was chosen as the royal resi-
dence; since it offered the greatest security against attack, either. from David
or from the Philistines. Here the coronation of Ish-bosheth took place. His
reign was-fgrst accepted by the tribes east of Jordan, and was finally extended
over all Israel except Judah."--Patriarchs and Prophets, pages 698, 699.


   4. Who was defeated in the first test of strength between the
opposing forces? Verse 17.


   5. What was the result of the long war between the houses of
Said and DiVid? 2 Sam. 3:1.

                All Israel United Under David
  6. Incensed against Ish-bosheth because of a personal grievance,
what did Abner propose to David? Verse 12.


    7. What efforts did Abner make to place all Israel under David's
rule? Verses 17-21.
    Nora.—"The overtures for the transference of the kingdom of Israel were
finally made by Abner himself, who for years had known that he was fighting
against God, and at last told the puppet king whom he had set up and sup-
ported that what God had sworn to David he was resolved to effect—namely,
to translate the kingdom from Dan even to Beersheba, from the house of Saul
to that of David. The negotiations with Israel and Benjamin were carried out
by Abner in entire independence of David."—F. B. Meyer, David: Shepherd,
Psalmist, King, page 156.


    8. Where, and under what circumstances, was this union ef-
fected? 2 Sam. 5:1-3.
    NorE.—"Thus through the providence of God the way had been opened
for him to come to the throne. He had no personal ambition to gratify, for he
had not sought the honor to which he had been brought. . . . The change in
the sentiments of the people was marked and decisive. The revolution was
quiet and dignified, befitting the great work they were doing."—Patriarchs and
Prophets, page 701.

                      The Reign of David
    9. What was one of David's first acts on becoming king of united
Israel? Verses 6-9.
    NOTE.—"As soon as David was established on the throne of Israel, he
began to seek a more appropriate location for the capital of his realm. Twenty
miles from Hebron, a place was selected as the future metropolis of the king-
dom. Before Joshua had led the armies of Israel over Jordan, it had been
called Salem. Near this place, Abraham had proved his loyalty to God. Eight
hundred years before the coronation of David, it had been the home of Mel-
chizedek, the priest of the most high God. . . .
    "In order to secure this location, the Hebrews must dispossess a remnant
of the Canaanites, who held a fortified position on the mountains of Zion and
Moriah. This stronghold was called Jebus, and its inhabitants were known as
Jebusites. For centuries, Jebus had been looked upon as impregnable; but it
was besieged and taken by the Hebrews under the command of Joab, who, as
the reward of his valor, was made commander in chief of the armies of Israel.
Jebus now became the national capital, and its heathen name was changed to
Jerusalem."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 703.

    10. From what did David perceive that the Lord had established
his rule? Verses 10-12.
                                     18
   11. What cherished plan did David now set about to realize?
2 Sam. 6:1-5.

     12. By what tragedy was David's hope frustrated at this time?
Verses 6-10.
    NoTE.—"The fate of Uzzah was .a divine judgment upon the violation of
a most explicit command. Through Moses the Lord had given special instruc-
tion concerning the transportation of the ark. None but the priests, the de-
scendants of Aaron, were to touch it, or even to look upon it uncovered.. . .
Thus in the bringing of the ark from Kirjath-jearim, there had been a direct
and inexcusable disregard of the Lord's directions. . . .
    "God can accept no partial obedience, no lax way of treating His com-
mandments. By the judgment upon Uzzah, He designed to impress upon all
Israel the importance of giving strict heed to His requirenients. Thus the death
of that one man, by leading the people to repentance, might prevent the neces-
sity of inflicting judgments upon thousands."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pages
705, 706.

     13. When, and in what manner, was the removal of the ark
safely accomplished? Verses 11, 13-15, 17-19.
   NoTE.—"Upon David the divine rebuke accomplished its work. He was
led to realize, as he had never realized before, the sacredness of the law of
God, and the necessity of strict obedience."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 706.
   "The solemn ceremonies attending the removal of the ark had made a last-
ing impression upon the people of Israel, arousing a deeper interest in the
sanctuary service, and kindling anew their zeal for Jehovah. David endeav-
ored by every means in his power, to deepen these impressions."—/bid, page
711.

   14. What was the secret of David's success in the wars with sur-
rounding nations? 2 Sam. 8:6, last part.


   15. How did David fulfill the pledge given Jonathan and Saul (1
Sam. 20:14-17; 24:20-22) now that his kingdom was established?
2 Samuel 9.

                      David's Evil. Plottings
    1. What divine instruction had David violated? Deut. 17:17;
2 Sam. 3:2-5; 5:15.-
   2. What grievous sin did David commit? 2 Sam. 11:2-5; Ex.
20:14.


     3. What was the punishment for such a crime? Lev. 20:10.
    NoTE.—"It was the spirit of self-confidence and self-exaltation that pre-
pared the way for David's fall. Flattery, and the subtle allurements of power
and luxury, were not without effect upon him. Intercourse with surrounding
nations also exerted an influence for evil. According to the customs prevailing
among Eastern rulers, crimes not to be tolerated in subjects were uncondemned
in the king; the monarch was not under obligation to exercise the same self-
restraint as the subject. All this tended to lessen David's sense of the exceed-
ing sinfulness of sin. And instead of relying in humility upon the power of
Jehovah, he began to trust to his own wisdom and might. As soon as Satan can
separate the soul from God, the only source of strength, he will seek to arouse
the unholy desires of man's carnal nature."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pages
717, 718.


   4. By what treacherous scheme did David seek to conceal his
crime? 2 Sam. 11:6-13.



     5. Failing in his attempt, how did he then determine to rid him-
self of Uriah? Verses 14, 15.
    NoTE.—"Every effort which David made to conceal his guilt proved un-
availing. He had betrayed himself into the power of Satan ; danger surrounded
him, dishonor more bitter than death was before him. There appeared but
one way of escape, and in his desperation he was hurried on to add murder
to adultery. He who had compassed the destruction of Saul, was seeking to
lead David also to ruin. Though the temptations were different, they were
alike in leading to transgression of God's law."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
pages 718, 719.


   6. Describe how Joab co-operated in carrying out the king's
command. What messages then passed between David and Joab?
Verses 16-25.


     7. After the days of mourning for Uriah, what did David do?
Verse 27, first part.
    NOTE.—"He whose tender conscience and high sense of honor would not
permit him, even when in peril of his life, to put forth his hand against the
Lord's anointed, had so fallen that he could wrong and murder one of his most
faithful and most valiant soldiers, and hope to enjoy undisturbed the reward
of his sins."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 720.

                   The Lord Sends Nathan to David
    8. How had the Lord viewed David's sin? Verse 27, last part.
   NoTE.—"As time passed on, David's sin toward Bath-sheba became known,
and suspicion was excited that he had planned the death of Uriah. The Lord
was dishonored. He had favored and exalted David, and David's sin misrep-
resented the character of God, and cast reproach upon His name. It tended to
lower the standard of godliness in Israel, to lessen in many minds the abhor-
rence of sin; while those who did not love and fear God were by it embold-
ened in transgression."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 720.


    9. What message did Nathan deliver to the king? 2 Sam. 12:1-4.


    10. What sentence did David unwittingly pronounce upon him-
self? Verses 5, 6; Ex. 22:1.


                            "Thou Art the Man"
     11. How forcefully was the verdict now brought home to David
by the prophet? 2 Sam. 12:7-9.
    NOTE.-"It was a message terrible in its severity. To few sovereigns could
such a reproof be given but at the price of certain death to the reprover. Na-
than delivered the divine sentence unflinchingly, yet with such heaven-born
wisdom as to engage the sympathies of the king, to arouse his conscience, and
to call from his lips the sentence of death upon himself. Appealing to David
as the divinely appointed guardian of his people's rights, the prophet repeated
a story of wrong and oppression that demanded redress."—Patriarchs and
Prophets, pages 720, 721.


    12. How did David respond to this scathing rebuke by Nathan?
Of what was he immediately assured? Verse 13.
   NOTE.—"The history of David furnishes no countenance to sin. It was
when he was walking in the counsel of God, that he was called a man after
God's own heart. When he sinned, this ceased to be true of him until by re-
pentance he had returned to the Lord. The word of God plainly declares, 'The
thing that David had done was evil in the eyes of Jehovah.' And the Lord
said to David by the prophet, 'Wherefore hast thou despised the command-
ment of the Lord, to do evil in His sight? . . . Now therefore the sword
shall never depart from thine house; because thou hast despised Me.' Though
David repented of his sin, and was forgiven and accepted by the Lord, he
reaped the baleful harvest of the seed he himself had sown. The judgments
upon him and upon his house testify to God's abhorrence of the sin."—Patri-
archs and Prophets, page 723.


   13. What were to be some of the doleful effects in later years of
David's sins? Verses 10-12, 14.
                               [21•]
    NorE.—"There was a great change in David himself. He was broken in
spirit by the consciousness of his sin and its far-reaching results. He felt hum-
bled in the eyes of his subjects. His influence was weakened. Hitherto his
prosperity had been attributed to his conscientious obedience to the command-
ments of the Lord. But now his subjects, having a knowledge of his sin, would
be led to sin more freely. His authority in his own household, his claim to
respect and obedience from his sons, was weakened. A sense of his guilt kept
him silent when he should have condemned sin; it made his arm feeble to
execute justice in his house. His evil example exerted its influence upon his
sons, and God would not interpose to prevent the result. He would permit
things to take their natural course, and thus David was severely chastised."—
Patriarchs and Prophets, page 723.

      14. What did David say in his confession? Ps. 51:3, 4, 7, 10, 14,
17.

    15. What lesson related to this incident may we draw for our-
selves? Ps. 32:5-7.
    NoTE.—"This passage in David's history is full of significance to the repent-
ing sinner. It is one of the most forcible illustrations given us of the struggles
and temptations of humanity, and of genuine repentance toward God and
faith in our Lord Jesus Christ. Through all the ages, it has proved a source
of encouragement to souls that, having fallen into sin, were struggling under
the burden of their guilt. Thousands of the children of God, who have been
betrayed into sin, when- ready to give up to despair have remembered how
David's sincere repentance and confession were accepted by God, notwith-
standing he suffered for his transgression; and they also have taken courage
to repent, and try again to walk in the way of God's commandments."—Patri-
archs and Prophets, page 726.

cunningly won the people's hearts? 2 Sam. 14:25, 26; 15:1-6.
    NOTE.--Absalonas• the only son of David who also, through his mother,
Maacah, daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur, was of royal lineage. Having
slain in revenge his brother Amnon, the first-born and heir apparent, he had
fled to his grandfather in Geshur to escape punishment. Here he remained
three.:yearhmben lte:Was, pertnitted.to return to Jerusale.m,-but forbidden to
appear at court for two years. Then he was restored .to royal, favor. Since
                                         22.1
Chileab, the second son, was probably dead or unfitted for the kingdom, Absa-
lom had curried the favor of the people and now believed the time opportune
to attempt a revolt that would seat him on his aging father's throne.
     "The influence of David's listlessness and irresolution extended to his sub-
ordinates; negligence and delay characterized the administration of justice.
Absalom artfully turned every cause of dissatisfaction to his own advantage.
. . . Yet the king, blinded by affection for his son, suspected nothing."—
Patriarchs and Prophets, pages 729, 730.

      2. Under what pretext had Absalom gone to Hebron? What
happened when he was there? Verses 7-12.
     NorE.—Hebron was chOsen "both on account of the facilities it offered for
retreat in case of failure, and as the city where formerly (in the case of David)
a new royalty had been instituted; perhaps also as the birthplace of Absalom.
. . . It was a clever device for entrapping two hundred influential persons
from Jerusalem to invite them to accompany him, on pretext of taking part
in the sacrificial feast. Arrived at Hebron, the mask was thrown off, and the
conspiracy rapidly assumed most formidable proportions."—Alfred Edersheim,
History of Judah and Israel, vol. 5, pp. 17, 18.

   3. When news of Absalom's revolt reached David, what did he
decide to do? Who accompanied him? Verses 13-23.


                David's Flight; His Forces Finally Prevail
     4. Recall (a) why David advised the priests to return with the
ark; (b) the manner of David's departure from Jerusalem; (c) the
provision made to defeat Ahithophel's counsel. Verses 24-37.
    NorE.—"Hushai the Archite, a wise and able counselor, who had proved
himself a faithful friend to David, now came to him with his robes rent, and
with earth upon his head, to cast in his fortunes with the dethroned and fugi-
tive king. David saw, as by a divine enlightenment, that this man, faithful and
truehearted, was the one needed to serve the interests of the king in the coun-
cils at the capital."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 735.
    "Hushai, not certain that his counsel would be followed by the fickle king,
lost no time in warning David to escape beyond Jordan without delay."—
Ibid., page 741.
    Thus David gained time to gather his forces for the coming battle.


  5. Describe how Hushai, David's friend, succeeded in his task.
How was word passed on to David? 2 Sam. 17:1-22.


   6. Where did the opposing armies meet in battle? How great
was the loss of men? In what manner did Absalom meet death?
2 Sam. 18:1.17.
                                      f 23 I
    NOTE.—"The king's solicitude, seeming to declare that Absalom was dearer
to him than his kingdom, dearer even than the subjects faithful to his throne,
only increased the indignation of the soldiers against the unnatural son."—
Patriarchs and Prophets, page 743.


    7. How did David express his grief at Absalom's death? Verse
33.
   NorE.—"It is beneath the storm skies of that rebellion, that he recovers
the dignity he had all but lost. His moral nature had been stained, but had
not suffered decay: it had been saved from inward corruption, or else he could
not have so repaired his majesty—one of the most grandly pathetic figures of
time; now charging the captains so insistently—Peal gently for my sake with
the young man, even with Absalom,' now sobbing his solitary woe in the
chamber over the gate—'Would God I had died for thee, 0 Absalom, my son,
my son l' Perhaps he knew and felt that had his own life not been so tainted,
the son would not have been flung into a traitor's grave. Let no one ever
point a finger at David's sin, unless he knows something of the scorching tears
of his remorse. It is not a question whether a saint may sin or not; it is how
he bears his sin's punishment that makes him saint, or unmakes him."—Milli-
gan, Men of the Old Testament, pages 298, 299.


                      David Faces Further Troubles
    8. What sad experience followed David's numbering Israel?
1 Chron. 21:1-14.
    NoTE.—"The sin of numbering the people probably lay in its motive. David
was animated by a spirit of pride and vainglory. He was eager to make a fine
show among the surrounding nations, and impress them with a conception of
                                                                              .
Israel's greatness, so that they might not dare to attack any point on the long
frontier line. There was a tendency to exchange his chosen position of wait-
ing only on God, and to trust in the arm of human prowess and organization."
—F. B. Meyer, David: Shepherd, Psalmist, King, page 208.


     9. What second attempt was made to usurp the throne' Who
joined in the plot? 1 Kings 1:1, 5-7.•           •
    NOTE.—"The hardships and exposures of hiS early wanderings, his many
wars, the cares and afflictions of his later years, had sapped the fci.iintain of
life."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 749.


    10. Note how Adonijah's plans were thwarted. Verses 8, 10-40.


   11. Hearing of Solomon's anointing as king, what did he do to
save his-life? With what result? Verses 41-53.
   NOTE. "The conspiracy was crushed. Its chief actors had incurred the
penalty of death. Abiathar's life was spared, out of respect,to his office and
                                     [ 24 ]
his former fidelity to David; but he was degraded from the office of high
priest, which passed to the line of Zadok. Joab and Adonijah were spared for
the time, but after the death of David they suffered the penalty of their crime.
The execution of the sentence upon the son of David completed the fourfold
judgment that testified to God's abhorrence of the father's sin."—Patriarchs
and Prophets, pages 749, 750.

              David Establishes Solomon in His Kingdom
    12. What solemn assembly had David called in his closing days?
1 Chron. 28:1-10.
    NOTE.—"Seeing that his end was near, the king summoned the princes of
Israel, with representative men from all parts of the kingdom, to receive this
legacy in trust. He desired to commit to them his dying charge, and secure
their concurrence and support in the great work to be accomplished. Because
of his physical weakness, it had not been expected that he would attend to this
transfer in person; but the inspiration of God came upon him, and with more
than his wonted fervor and power, he was able, for the last time, to address
his people."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 750.

    13. Though to David had been denied the building of the temple
in his earlier years, what ample provision, had he made to facilitate
the task of his successor? Verses 11-19; 29:1-9.

    14. Viewing David's loyalty to God, what estimate of his life
was later recorded? 1 Kings 15:5.
   NOTE.—"Great had been David's fall, but deep was his repentance, ardent
was his love, and strong his faith. He had been forgiven much, and therefore
he loved much. . . .
   "Glorious are the promises made to David and his house, promises that look
forward to the eternal ages, and find their complete fulfillment in Christ."—
Patriarchs and Prophets, page 754.

                    The Wisdom of Solcithori •
     MEMORY VERSE: "The Lord our God be with us, as He was with our fathers:
let Him not leave us, nor forsake us; that He may incline our hearts unto Him, to
walk in all His ways, and to keep His commandments." 1 Kings 8:57, 58.

                  The Lord Appears Unto SoloMon
   1. When Solomon had come to the throne, for what purpose
did he go to Gibeon? 1 Kings 3:4.
   NOTE.—From 2 Chronicles 1:1-5 we learn that the visit to Gibeon, a city
about, seven miles from Jerusalem, was a great occasion of ,state; intended
                                      [26 7
evidently to celebrate Solomon's accession to the throne. That was the great
"high place," because the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar of sacri-
fices were located there, except the ark of the covenant. The special circum-
stances explain the large amount of burnt offerings. Compare 1 Chronicles
16:39; 21:29.


   2. How did the Lord appear unto Solomon while there? What
was he told to do? What was Solomon's reply? 1 Kings 3:5-9.


  3. With what was the Lord pleased? To what extent was Solo-
mon's request to be fulfilled? Verses 10-12.
    NOTE.—"Those who today occupy positions of trust should seek to learn
the lesson taught by Solomon's prayer. The higher the position a man occu-
pies, the greater the responsibility that he has to bear, the wider will be the
influence that he exerts, and the greater his need of dependence on God. Ever
should he remember that with the call to work, comes the call to walk cir-
cumspectly before his fellow men. He is to stand before God in the attitude
of a learner. Position does not give holiness of character. It is by honoring
God and obeying His commands that a man is made truly great. The God
whom we serve is no respecter of persons. He who gave to Solomon the spirit
of wise discernment, is willing to impart the same blessing to His children
today. . . . When' a burden bearer desires wisdom more than he desires
wealth, power, or fame, he will not be disappointed. Such a one will learn
from the great Teacher not only what to do, but how to do it in a way that
will meet with the divine approval."—Prophets and Kings, pages 30, 31.


                 Solomon's Wisdom Is Unexcelled
      4. What did God add because of the king's wise choice? Verse
13.


     5. What further additional promise was made? Verses 14, 15,
first part.
    NorE.—"Solomon had shown something of the'spirit which seeks first the
kingdom of God and His righteousness, and therefore all other things were
added unto him. The promise of length of days was, however, made condi-
tional on Solomon's continued faithfulness, and he forfeited its fulfillment by
his subsequent apostasies. He reigned forty years, but died at the age of
sixty, and did not attain the age of his father. The conditions on which the
gift of 'wisdom' were made to depend might have served to Solomon as a
warning that his ideal of wisdom was not as yet the highest—that all wisdom
begins and ends in the fear of the Lord; that without holiness the gift of
earthly prudence and political insight and varied knowledge are of no per-
manent avail."—F. W. Farrar, Solomon: His Life and Times, pages 59, 60.
                                     C I
   6. Relate the incident that revealed Solomon's keen sense of hu-
man nature. How did this experience react upon the nation? Verses
16-28.
    NoTE.—"Evidence of the reality of God's promise soon appeared, and that
in a manner peculiarly calculated to impress the Eastern mind.... The ready
wisdom with which Solomon devised means for ascertaining the truth would
commend itself to the popular mind. It was just what they would appreciate
in their king. Such a monarch would indeed be a terror to evildoers, and a
protection and praise to them that did well. It is probably in order to explain
the rapid spread of Solomon's fame that this instance of his wisdom is related
in Holy Scripture (1 Kings 3:28)."—Alfred Edersheim, History of Israel and
Judah, vol. 5, pp. 66, 67.


   7. How is Solomon's wisdom compared with the wisdom of his
time? 1 Kings 4:29-31.


   8. Who came to the court of Solomon to hear his wisdom?
Verse 34.

               The Temple at Jerusalem Is Built
   9. Following the Lord's promise to David (1 Chron. 22:9, 10).
what did Solomon proceed to do? How long was the temple in
building? 1 Kings 6:1, 37, 38.
  NOTE.-"Of surpassing beauty and unrivaled splendor was the palatial
building which Solomon and his associates erected for God and His worship.
Garnished with precious stones, surrounded by spacious courts with magnifi-
cent approaches, and lined with carved cedar and burnished gold, the temple
structure, with its broidered hangings and rich furnishings, was a fit emblem
of the living church of God on earth, which through the ages has been build-
ing in accordance with the divine pattern, with materials that have been lik-
ened to 'gold, silver, precious stones,' polished after the similitude of a pal-
ace.'"—Prophets and Kings, page 36.


   10. How did the Lord manifest His presence when the temple
was completed and the ark deposited in the most holy place? 1
Kings 8:10, 11.

    11. As Solomon witnessed the presence of the Lord, for what
did he plead in his beautiful prayer of consecration. Verses 23-50.


    12. What fitting ceremony preceded and concluded the solemn
service? Verses 14, 55-58.
                                      t 27 1
      13. Why had the queen of Sheba come to Jerusalem? What was
her testimony concerning Solomon's wisdom? 1 Kings 10:1, 6-8.
     NOTE.—"Whatever may have specially influenced her to undertake so novel
a pilgrimage, three things in regard to it are beyond question. She was at-
tracted by the fame of Solomon's wisdom; she viewed (that wisdom in con-
nection with 'the name of Jehovah' (1 Kings 10:1) ; and she came to learn.
. . . The queen had come, scarcely daring to hope that Eastern exaggeration
had not led her to expect more than she would find. It proved the contrary.
. . . And here she would learn chiefly this: that all the prosperity she wit-
nessed, all the intellectual culture and civilization with which she was brought
into contact, had their spring above, with 'the Father of lights.' "—Alfred
Edersheim, History of Israel and Judah, vol. 5, p. 107.




                      Lesson 10, for March 4, 1944

   Solomon's Apostasy; His Proverbs and Songs
    MEMORY VERSE: "Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto
thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct thy
paths." Prov. 3: 5, 6.
    STUDY HELP: "Prophets and. Kings," pages 51-74.

                Solomon's Heart Turns From the Lord
     1. What principal cause is mentioned for Solomon's backslid-
ing? 1 Kings 11:1, 4, 7-10.
    NoTE.—"So gradual was Solomon's apostasy that before he was aware of
it, he had wandered far from. God. Almost imperceptibly he began to trust
less and less in divine guidance and blessing, and to put confidence in his own
strength. Little by little he withheld from God that unswerving obedience
which was to make Israel a peculiar people, and he conformed more and more
closely to the customs of the surrounding nations. Yielding to the tempta-
tions incident to his success and his honored position, he forgot the Source of
his prosperity. -An ambition to excel all other nations in power, and grandeur
led' him ,to pervert for selfish purposes the heavenly gifts hitherto employed
for the 'glory of God. . . . His wives exerted a strong influence over him,
and gradually prevailed on him to unite with them in their worship. . . .
His separation from God through communication with idolaters was his ruin.
As he cast off allegiance to God, he lost the mastery of himself,. His moral
efficiency was gone. His fine sensibilities became blunted, his conscience
seared."—Prophets. and.Kings, pages 55-57.


         What, other .influences contributed to Solomon's spiritual de-
cline?
                                     [   2s]
    Answer: His increasing luxury; alliances with heathen nations; imitation
of their manners and customs.
    NorE.—"The beginnings of Solomon's apostasy may be traced to many
seemingly slight deviations from right principles. Associations with idolatrous
women was by no means the only cause of his downfall. Among the primary
causes that led Solomon into extravagance and tyrannical oppression, was his
course in developing and cherishing a spirit of covetousness."—Ellen G. White,
in Review and Herald, Jan. 4, 1906.



    3. Note the Scripture record of the king's wealth and commer-
cial pursuits. 1 Kings 10:22, 26-29.


    4. Compare the striking contrast of Solomon's life with the in:
structions given by the Lord relating to the future king. Deut. 17:
16-20.


                   The Lord Warns Solomon
    5. How was Solomon warned of the result that would follow his
evil course? 1 Kings 11:9-13.


   6. What sobering effect did this stern message have upon the
king?
    Answer: "Awakened as from a dream by this sentence of judgment pro-
nounced against him and his house, Solomon with quickened conscience began
to see his folly in its true light. Chastened in spirit, with mind and body en-
feebled, he turned wearied and thirsting from earth's broken cisterns, to drink
once more at the fountain of life. For him at last the discipline of suffering
had accomplished its work. Long had he been harassed by the fear of utter
ruin because of inability to turn from folly; but now he discerned in the
message given him a ray of hope. "God had not utterly cut him off, but stood
ready to deliver him from a bondage more cruel than the grave, and from
which he had had no power to free himself."—Prophets and Kings, pages77, 78.



      7. Following the prediction made by the Lord, whom did He
, raise up to trouble Solomon's later years? Verses 14, 23, 26.


                Solomon's Literary Accomplishments
   8. In what special way has the wisdom of Solomon been re-
corded? ' , cflaat is the purpose of these sayings? . Prov. 1:14
                                     [ 29 ]
     NOTE.—"In the proverbs of Solomon are outlined principles of holy living
and high endeavor; principles that are heaven-born and that lead to godli-
ness; principles that should govern every act of life. It was the wide dissem-
ination of these principles, and the recognition of God as the one to whom all
praise and honor belong, that made Solomon's early reign a time of moral up-
lift as well as of material prosperity."—Prophets and Kings, pages 33, 34.

   9. What other writings have been preserved for us? Ecd. 1:1;
The Song of Solomon 1:1.

  10. How many proverbs and songs are ascribed to Solomon?
What was the scope of his teachings? 1 Kings 4:32, 33.
 N()TE.—"His wisdom exceeded that of all the philosophers and learned
men of the East, and his proverbs are classed among the wisest maxims of
antiquity. His knowledge of natural history, improved by collections of rare
plants and strange animals, which he obtained from every quarter of the
world, was regarded as miraculous."—Library of Universal History, vol. 1, p.
372.

    11. How does Solomon sum up the lessons he had learned in his
declining years? Eccl. 12:13, 14; Prov. 3:13-16.
   NOTE.—"Solomon's later writings reveal that as he realized more and still,
more the wickedness of his course, he gave special attention to warning the
youth against falling into the errors that had led him to squander for nought
Heaven's choicest gifts. With sorrow and shame he confessed that in the
prime of manhood, when he should have found God his comfort, his support,
his life, he turned from the light of Heaven and the wisdom of God, and put
idolatry in the place of the worship of Jehovah. And now, having learned
through sad experience the folly of such a life, his yearning desire was to save
others from entering into the bitter experience through which he had passed."
—Prophets and Kings, page 80.

    12. What spiritual application did Christ make of the fading
glory of Solomon's riches? Matt. 6:28, 29.
   NOTE. "Christ has warned us against the pride of life, but not against its
grace and natural beauty. He pointed to the flowers of the field, to the lily
unfolding in its purity, and said, 'Even Solomon in all his glory was not ar-
rayed like one of these.' . . .
   "The most beautiful dress He bids us wear upon the soul. No outward
adorning can compare in value or loveliness with that 'meek and quiet spirit'
which in His sight is 'of great price.' "—Ministry of Healing, pages 288, 289.,

   13. What lesson may we learn from the experience of Solomon's
departure from God?
    Answer: "In the midst of prosperity lurks danger. Throughout the ages,
riches and honor have ever been attended with peril to humility and spiritual-
                                    ( SO
ity. It is not the empty cup that we have difficulty in carrying; it is the cup
full to the brim that must be carefully balanced. Affliction and adversity may
cause sorrow; but it is prosperity that is most dangerous to spiritual life.
Unless the human subject is in constant submission to the will of God, unless
he is sanctified by the truth, prosperity will surely arouse the natural inclina-
tion to presumption."—Prophets and Kings, pages 59, 60.


                     Lesson 11, for March 11, 1944
   Ten Tribes Secede; The Disobedient Prophet
    MEMORY VERSE: "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge: but
fools despise wisdom and instruction." Prov. 1:7.
    STUDY HELP: "Prophets and Kings," pages 87-108.

                    Rehoboam's Disastrous Course
     1. After the death of Solomon, where did his son Rehoboam go
for his coronation? Who appeared from exile? 1 Kings 12:1-3.
    NoTE.—It was doubtless generally known that the prophet Ahijah, him-
self from Ephraim, had advised Jeroboam in the name of the Lord, that the
kingdom would be rent and ten tribes given to him. 1 Kings 11:29-31.


     2. What reasonable concessions did Jeroboam demand of Reho-
boam in behalf of Israel? 1 Kings 12:4, 5.
    IsloTE.—"The tribes had long suffered grievous wrongs under the oppres-
sive measures of their former ruler. The extravagance of Solomon's reign
during his apostasy had led him to tax the people heavily, and to require of
them much menial service. Before going forward with the coronation of a new
ruler, the leading men from among the tribes determined to ascertain whether
or not it was the purpose of Solomon's son to lessen these burdens."—Proph-
ets and Kings, pages 88, 89.


    3. When Rehoboam consulted his old counselors, what wise
policy did they urge him to pursue? Verses 6, 7.


   4. Desiring further advice, to whom did he then turn? What
counsel did they give the king? Verses 8-11.


                 Jeroboam Is Made King Over Israel
    5. When the ten tribes heard the stern reply of Rehoboam, what
course did they take? Verses 16, 19, 20.         .
   Nova.—"Had Rehoboam and his inexperienced counselors understood the
divine will concerning Israel, they would have listened to the request of the
                                      [ 81 ]
people for decided reforms in the administration' of the government. But in
the hour of opportunity that came to them during the meeting in Shechem,
they failed to reason from cause to effect, and thus forever weakened their
influence over a large number of people. . . . The breach created by the
rash speech of Rehoboam'proved irreparable. Thenceforth the twelve tribes of
Israel were divided, the tribes of Judah and Benjamin composing the lower
or southern kingdom of Judah, under the rulership of Rehoboam; while the
ten northern tribes formed and maintained a separate government, known as
the kingdom of Israel, with Jeroboam as their ruler."—Prophets and Kings,
pages 90, 91.

     6. How did Rehoboam attempt to regain the kingdom? What
word was sent him by the Lord? Verses 21-24.
    NoTE.—Though at this time Rehoboam hearkened to the message of the
Lord, a later record says: "There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam
all their days." 1 Kings 14:30.
    "The people whom God had chosen to stand as a light to the surrounding
nations, were turning from their Source of strength, and seeking to become
like the nations about them. As with Solomon, so with Rehoboam,—the influ-
ence of wrong example led many astray. And as with them, so to a greater
or less degree is it today with everyone who gives himself up to work evil,—
the influence of wrongdoing is not confined to the doer. No man liveth unto
himself. None perish alone in their iniquity. Every life is a light that bright-
ens and cheers the pathway of others, or a dark and desolating influence that
tends toward despair and ruin. We lead others either upward to happiness
and immortal life, or downward to sorrow and eternal death. And if by our
deeds we strengthen or force into activity the evil powers of those around us,
we share their sin."—Prophets and Kings, page 94.

                Jeroboam Disrupts the Religious Unity
     7. What reasoning formed the basis of Jeroboam's introduction
of his idolatrous worship? 1 Kings 12:26-33.
    NOTE.—This he did in defiance of the clear directions of the Lord through
the prophet Abijah. It was the Lord's purpose, by retaining the tribe of Judah
for the house of David, that the unity of religious worship of all Israel should
remain unimpaired. Its center was to continue "in Jerusalem, the city which
I have chosen Me to put My name there." 1 Kings 11:36. Though the seces-
sion of the ten tribes was from the Lord (chapter 12:5, 24), yet it was on
condition of no change in their religious allegiance. It was clear that the
spiritual hope of the whole nation was bound up with the house of David,
to whom the promises of the Redeemer had been given. Jeroboam's action,
growing out of political considerations, struck a fatal blow to this spiritual
unity of the people, from which it never fully recovered.


   8. How did the Lord show His displeasure at Jeroboam's action?
What happened to the king? How was he restored? 1 Kings 13:1-6.
  NoTE.—"Now, if ever, would Jehovah vindicate His authority, prove His
word, and show before all the people,that He, whose authority they had cast

off, was the living God. Then and there must it be shown, in the idol temple,
at the first consecration of that spurious altar, at the first false feast, and upon
King Jeroboam, in the pomp of his splendor and the.boastfulness of his sup-
posed power (compare here Acts 12:22, 23). The king had put forth his hand,
but he could not draw it back: the hand of the Lord held it. Some mysterious
stroke had fallen upon him; and while he thus stood, himself a sign, the top
of the altar suddenly parted, and the ashes, clogged and heavy with the fat
of idol sacrifices, poured out around him."—Alfred Edersheim, History of
Israel and Judah, vol. 5, p. 141.


    9. While refusing Jeroboam's invitation, how was the prophet
persuaded to disregard the direct charge given him by the Lord?
1 Kings 13:7-19.
    NOTE.—"The mere fact of the 'man of God' entering the king's palace and
sharing his feast—probably a sacrificial idol feast—would not only have been
contrary to the whole scope and spirit of his embassy, but have destroyed the
moral effect of the scene enacted before the people. . . . They [the directions
given the prophet] indicated that Bethel lay under the ban; that no fellow-
ship of any kind was to be held with it; and that even the way by which the
messenger of God had come, was to be regarded as consecrated, and not to be
retraced."—Alfred Edersheim, History of Israel and Judah,vol. 5, p. 143.


             The Prophet's Disobedience Is Punished
    10. What message of rebuke came to the man of God as he ate
the forbidden meal? Verses 20-22.


     11. How speedily, and in what manner, was this .prophecy ful-
filled? Verses 23-25.


   12. How did the old prophet convince himself of the report re-
ceived? What did he further do?. What instruction did he give
concerning himself? Verses 26-31.


    13. Contrast the effect this divine judgment had on the old
prophet and on Jeroboam? Verses 32-34.
   NoTE.—"The penalty that overtook the unfaithful messenger was a still
further evidence of the truth of the prophecy uttered over the altar. If, after
disobeying the word of the Lord, the prophet had been permitted to go on in
safety, the king would have used this fact in an attempt to vindicate his own
disobedience. In the rent altar, in the palsied arm, and in the terrible fate of
the one who dared disobey an express command of Jehovah, Jeroboam should,
have discerned the swift displeasure of an offended God, and these judgments
should have warned him not to persist in wrongdoing."—Prophets and Kings,
page 107.

     14. What terrible indictment and punishment were pronounced
 upon Jeroboam by the prophet Ahijah because of his continued
 evil course? 1 Kings 14:7-11.




                        Lesson 12, for March 18, 1944

               Elijah at Cherith and Zarephath
      MEMORY VERSE: "For thus saith the Lord God of Israel, The barrel of meal
 shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the Lord sendetb
 rain upon the earth." 1 Kings 17:14.
      STUDY HELP: "Prophets and Kings," pages 119-132.

                   Elijah Before Ahab; Retires to Cherith
     1. What is the record of the kings from Jeroboam to Ahab's ac-
 cession to the throne of Israel? 1 Kings 16:25-30.
    NoTE.—Five kings had reigned some forty years. Two ruled only two
 years each; another but seven days. Two kings were slain by usurpers, who
 succeeded them. One was deposed and committed suicide. Of them all it is
 said that they walked in the ways of Jeroboam, who had made Israel to sin.
 Of the fifth, Omri, we read, that he "wrought evil in the eyes of the Lord, and
 did worse than all that were before him." 1 Kings 16:25. Such was the legacy
 his son Ahab entered upon. The time certainly was ripe for a sweeping re-
 form in Israel.


       2. Who then suddenly appeared upon the scene? What was the
  prophet's challenging message to King Ahab? 1 Kings 17:1.
      NOTE.—"Among the mountains of Gilead, east of the Jordan, there dwelt
  in the days of Ahab a man of faith and prayer whose fearless ministry was
  destined to check the rapid spread of apostasy in Israel. Far removed from
  any city of renown, and occupying no high station in life, Elijah the Tishbite
  nevertheless entered upon his mission confident in God's purpose to prepare
  the way before him and to give him abundant success. The word of faith and
  power was upon his lips, and his whole life was devoted to the work of re-
   form."—Prophets and Kings, page 119.
      "Oft-repeated appeals, remonstrances, and warnings had failed to bring
  Israel to repentance. The time had come when God must speak to them by
  means of judgments. Inasmuch as the worshipers of Baal claimed that the
  treasures of heaven, the dew and the rain, came not from Jehovah, but from
  the ruling forces of nature, and that it was through the creative energy of the
  sun that the earth was enriched and made to bring forth abundantly, the
  curse of God was to rest heavily upon the polluted land. The apostate tribes
, of Israel were to be shown the folly of trusting to the power of Baal for tem-
  poral blessings. Until they should turn to God with repentance, and acknowl-
  edge Him as the source of all blessing, there should fall upon the land neither
  dew nor rain."—I bid., page 120.
                                            $4
    3. Following Elijah's announcement to Ahab, what command
did God give him? 'What promise was connected with it? Verses
2-4.

     4. As he obeyed the command, how miraculously did the Lord
provide for his needs? What happened as the drought continued?
Verses 5-7.
    NoTE.—"The prophet's words went into immediate effect. Those who were
at first inclined to scoff at the thought of calamity, soon had occasion for
serious reflection; for after a few months the earth, unrefreshed by dew or
rain, became dry, and vegetation withered. As time passed, streams that had
never been known to fail, began to decrease, and brooks began to dry up. . . .
    "A year passes, and yet there is no rain. The earth is parched as if with
fire. The scorching heat of the sun destroys what little vegetation has sur-
vived. Streams dry up, and lowing herds and bleating flocks wander hither
and thither in distress. Once-flourishing fields have become like burning desert
sands,—a desolate waste."—Prophets and Kings, pages 123, 124.
                     With the Widow at Zarephath
    5. In his hour of need, where was Elijah directed to go? Who
was to take care of him there? Verses 8, 9.
    NOTE.—"This woman was not an Israelite. She had never had the privi-
leges and blessings that the chosen people of God had enjoyed; but she was
a believer in the true God, and had walked in all the light that was shining
on her pathway. And now, when there was no safety for Elijah in the land
of Israel, God sent him to this woman to find an asylum in her home."—
Prophets and Kings, page 129.
    Elijah would hardly have gone to Zarephath of his own choice. South of
Sidon, it was located in the territory of Jezebel's father, Ethbaal, king of the
Zidonians, or Phoenicia. He had formerly been priest of Ashtoreth, and had
succeeded to the throne by murdering his predecessor. It was this idolatrous
worship that Ahab was so vigorously establishing in all Israel in place of the
allegiance to Jehovah. Hence, it would certainly appear unsafe for Elijah to
seek refuge there as the avowed enemy of the king.

   6. Arriving at Zarephath, how did Elijah find the widow? What
did he first ask of her? Verse 10.

   7. As she was about to go, what further request did the prophet
make? How did the widow then reveal the degree of her poverty?
Verses 11, 12.
     8. What did Elijah instruct her to do? How did he assure her of
God's blessing in preparing what she thought was their last meal?
Verses 13, 14.
    NoTE.—"In this poverty-stricken home the famine pressed sore; and the
pitifully meager fare seemed about to fail. The coming of Elijah on the very
                                      [35]
day when the widow feared that she must give up.tlie struggle to systain.life,
tested to the utmost her faith in the power of the living God to'provide for her
necessities. But even in her dire extremity, she bore witness to her faith by
a compliance with the request of the stranger who was asking her to share
her last morsel with him."—Prophets and Kings, page 130.

    9. When the widow carried out the instruction, how fully was
the Lord's promise realized? Verses 15, 16.
    NOTE.—"No greater test of faith than this could have been required. The
widow had hitherto treated all strangers with kindness and liberality. Now,
regardless of the suffering that might result to herself and child, and trusting
in the God of Israel to supply her every need, she met this supreme test of
hospitality by doing 'according to the saying of Elijah.' . . . The widow of
Zarephath shared her morsel with Elijah; and in return, her life and that of
her son were preserved. And to all who, in time of trial and want, give sym-
pathy and assistance to others more needy, God has promised great blessing.
He has not changed. His power is no less now than in the days of Elijah. No
less sure now than when spoken by our Saviour is the promise, 'He that receiv-
eth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward.' "—
Prophets and Kings, page 130-132.

                        The Widow's Son Is Restored
   10. What great sorrow came to the widow about this time? How
did she associate the prophet with her troubled state of mind?
Verses 17, 18.

    11. Where did Elijah immediately take her son? Describe his
action, and his earnest pleadings with the Lord. Verses 19-21.

    12. How did the Lord honor the faith of His servant? Verse 22.

    13. How did Elijah present the son to his mother? Of what was
she then convinced? Verses 23, 24.

   14. What encouragement may God's children derive from the
experience of Elijah's fervent devotion? James 5:16-18.


                       Lesson 13, for March 25, 1944
               The Prophets of Baal Destroyed
     MEMORY VERSE: "Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he
prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of
three years and six months. And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the
earth brought forth her fruit." James 5:17, 18.

                                          86
                         Elijah Is Called to Action
     1. What word from the Lord came to Elijah? How long was this
after his first message to Ahab? 1 Kings 18:1; Luke 4:25; James
5:17.
    NOTE.—"There is apprehension in the hearts of the priests as they remem-
ber that at the word of the prophet the land of Israel for three years and a half
has been destitute of dew and rain. Some fearful crisis is at hand, they feel
sure. The gods in whom they have trusted have been unable to prove Elijah
a false prophet. To their frantic cries, their prayers, their tears, their humilia-
tion, their revolting ceremonies, their costly and ceaseless sacrifices, the ob-
jects of their worship have been strangely indifferent."—Prophets and Kings,
pages 144, 147.

   2. During this interval, how severely had Samaria been affected
by the drought? 1 Kings 18:2.

    3. For what purpose had Ahab called Obadiah? What was
Obadiah's attitude toward the Lord? How had he given proof of
this? Verses 3-6.

                 Israel Is Summoned on Mount Carmel
     4. What pointed charge did Ahab make as he met Elijah? How
did the prophet counter this? Verses 17, 18.
    NOTE.—"It is natural for the wrongdoer to hold the messengers of God
responsible for the calamities that come as the sure result of a departure from
the way of righteousness. Those who place themselves in Satan's power are
unable to see things as God sees them. When the mirror of truth is held up
before them, they become indignant at the thought of receiving reproof.
Blinded by sin, they refuse to repent; they feel that God's servants have
turned against them, and are worthy of severest censure.
    "Standing in conscious innocence before Ahab, Elijah makes no attempt
to excuse himself or to flatter the king. Nor does he seek to evade the king's
wrath by the good news that the drought is almost over. He has no apology
to offer. Indignant, and jealous for the honor of God, he casts back the im-
putation of Ahab, fearlessly declaring to the king that it is his sins, and the
sins of his fathers, that have brought upon Israel this terrible calamity."—
Prophets and Kings, pages 139, 140

    5. What command did Elijah give to Ahab? How fully did he
carry this instruction into effect? Verses 19, 20.

    6. When facing the large congregation, what straight question
did he ask the people? What was their attitude? Verse 21.
   NoTt.—"Unashamed, unterrified, the prophet stands before the multitude,
fully aware of his commission to execute the divine command. His counte-
                                  [ 37
nance is lighted with an awful solemnity. In anxious expectancy the people
wait for him to speak. Looking first upon the broken-down altar of Jehovah,
and then upon the multitude, Elijah cries out in dear, trumpetlike tones:
`How long halt ye between two opinions? if the Lord be God, follow Him:
but if Baal, then follow him.'
   "The people answer him not a word. Not one in that vast assembly dare
reveal loyalty to Jehovah. Like a dark cloud, deception and blindness had
overspread Israel. Not all at once had this fatal apostasy closed about them,
but gradually, as from time to time they had failed to heed the words of warn-
ing and reproof that the Lord sent them. Each departure from, right doing,
each refusal to repent, had deepened their guilt, and driven them farther from
heaven."—Prophets and Kings, page 147.


   7. What plan did Elijah set before the whole assembly? Having
made their choice, what did the priests of Baal do? How did they
conduct themselves? Verses 22-26.


    8. How did Elijah mock them? How did the priests then further
act in their wild frenzy? With what result? Verses 27-29.
   NorE.—"All day long the people have witnessed the demonstrations of the
baffled priests. They have beheld their wild leaping round the altar, as if
they would grasp the burning rays of the sun to serve their purpose. They
have looked with horror on the frightful, self-inflicted mutilations of the
priests, and have had opportunity to reflect on the follies of idol worship.
Many in the throng are weary of the exhibitions of demonism, and they now
await with deepest interest the movements of Elijah."—Prophets and Kings,
pages 150, 151.

                   Heaven's Response to Elijah's Plea
    9. As Baal's priests failed, whom did Elijah call? What did he
proceed to do? Describe the details of his preparations. Verses 30-35.
    NoTE.—Elijah's first act in the sight of all the people was to repair the altar
of the Lord that had been broken down in the persecution that had swept the
country. With his own hands he gathered up twelve of the remaining stones
and joined them into an improvised altar for the sacrifice. Thus he symbolized
the indivisible unity of all Israel's allegiance to Jehovah, which had been
destroyed by Jeroboam's introduction of idolatry.


     10. What was the burden of Elijah's fervent prayer? How did
God immediately answer? What was the response of the people?
Verses 36-39.
    NOTE.-"A silence, oppressive in its solemnity, rests upon all. The priests
of Baal tremble with terror. Conscious of their guilt, they look for swift retri-
bution. No sooner is the prayer of Elijah ended, than flames of fire, like bril-
liant flashes of lightning, descend from heaven upon the upreared altar, con-
                                      [ 38 ]
suming the sacrifice, licking up the water in the trench, and consuming even
the stones of the altar. . . It resembles the pillar of fire which at the Red
Sea separated the children of Israel from the Egyptian host.
    "The people on the mount prostrate themselves in awe before the unseen
God. They dare not continue to look upon the Heaven-sent fire. They fear
that they themselves will be consumed; and, convicted of their duty to ac-
knowledge the God of Elijah as the God of their fathers, to whom they owe
allegiance, they cry out together as with one voice, 'The Lord, He is the God;
the Lord, He is the God.' With startling distinctness the cry resounds over the
mountain and echoes in the plain below. At last Israel is aroused, undeceived,
penitent. At last the people see how greatly they have dishonored God.. . .
They are ready now to admit that the God of Elijah is above every idol."—
Prophets and Kings, pages 152, 153.


   11. What judgment was then executed upon the prophets of
Baal? Verse 40.


    12. What was Ahab directed to do? Where did Elijah go, and
for what purpose? How many times, did his servant look for signs
of rain? Verses 41-43.


    13. What did the servant then discover? What was Ahab told
to do? How was Elijah enabled to run before him to' Jezreel?
Verses 44-46.
   NoTE.—"This was enough. Elijah did not wait for the heavens to gather
blackness. In that small cloud, he beheld by faith an abundance of rain; and
he acted in harmony with his faith, sending his servant quickly to Ahab with
the message, 'Prepare thy chariot, and get thee down, that the rain stop thee
not.'"—Prophets and Kings, page 156.

      Thirteenth Sabbath Offering—March 2 5
T   HE overflow of the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering on March 25 is dedicated
     to the missions and unentered regions of the Southern African Division.
Years ago Africa was spoken of as the Dark Continent, but gospel light has
penetrated the darkness, and now it is the Continent of Great Opportunity. It
is our privilege on March 25 to extend the gospel message in this vast land, and
it is hoped that a generous offering will be given on that day.
     When we gave to this division in the fourth quarter of 1942, the overflow
amounted to $20,618.81. This was used in helping to erect and equip a much-
needed hospital in the Tanganyika field.
     Bear in mind that when the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering reaches $60,000,
there is an overflow of $2,000. Then it is increased by 20 per cent of all that
is given above $60,000. South Africa appeals for your help. Make a liberal
offering.
