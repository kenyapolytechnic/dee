   Lessons From the Days of the Patriarchs and Prophets

FROM THE CAPTIVITY IN BABYLON to the
 RESTORATION of the FIRST DOMINION


                       Lesson 1, for July 1, 1944
        Trained to Loyalty; the King's Dream
    LESSON SCRIPTURE: Daniel 1; 2.
    MEMORY VERSE: "Ye are My witnesses, saith the Lord, and My servant
whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe Me, and understand that I am
He: before Me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after Me." Isa. 43:10.
    STUDY HELP: "Prophets and Kings," pages 479-502.


                            Trained to Be Loyal
   1. When Nebuchadnezzar besieged and captured Jerusalem, what
did he do with certain of the children of Israel? What did he pro-
pose for their future? Dan. 1:1-7.
    NoTE.—"The king did not compel the Hebrew youth to renounce their
faith in favor of idolatry, but he hoped to bring this about gradually. By giv-
ing them names significant of idolatry, by bringing them daily into close assod-
ation with idolatrous customs, and under the influences of the seductive rites
of heathen worship, he hoped to induce them to renounce the religion of their
nation, and to unite with the worship of the Babylonians."—Prophets and
Kings, page 481.


   2. Who early appeared as a leader among them? To what de-
cision did he and his companions come? Verse 8.
   NoTE.—"A portion having been offered to idols, the food from the king's
table was consecrated to idolatry; and one partaking of it would be regarded as
offering homage to the gods of Babylon. In such homage, loyalty to Jehovah
forbade Daniel and his companions to join. Even a mere pretense of eating the
food or drinking the wine would be a denial of their faith."—Prophets and
Kings, page 481.



  3. What request did Daniel make of the chief steward? With
what result? Verses 9-16.

                                        131
  4. What special favor did God show these young men? In what
condition did the king find them? How long did Daniel serve Baby-
lon? Verses 17-21.

               The King's Dream Troubles Him
  5. What startling experience came to King Nebuchadnezzar in
the second year of his reign? How did he seek to solve his per-
plexity? Dan. 2:1-9.

6. What outstanding admission did the wise men of Babylon
make? What was the king's angry reaction? Verses 10-13, first part.


   7. Who was first sought to be slain? What did Daniel obtain?
How did he manifest faith in united prayer? Verses 13-18.
   NOTE.—"To this request the monarch acceded. 'Then Daniel went to his
house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his com-
panions.' Together they sought for wisdom from the Source of light and
knowledge. Their faith was strong in the consciousness that God had placed
them where they were, that they were doing His work and meeting the demands
of duty. . . . And they did not plead in vain. The God whom they had
honored, now honored them."—Prophets and Kings, pages 493, 494.

                       The Dream Revealed
  8. How was the king's dream revealed to Daniel? How did he
express his gratitude? Verses 19-23.


  9. To whom did Daniel then go? What request did he make and
with what result? Relate the conversation which took place before
the king. Verses 24-30.


  10. What had the king seen in his dream? What was the appear-
ance of the image and its effect upon the one who saw it? Verse 31.


  11. Describe the image as portrayed by the prophet to King
Nebuchadnezzar. Verses 32, 33.


  12. What did Daniel say the king had seen? Verses 34, 35.
                                   [4]
               The Interpretation of the Dream
  13. In the interpretation of the dream how did the prophet trace
the course of world history? Verses 36-43.


  14. How is the final overthrow of all earthly kingdoms described?
What does the prophet say of the certainty of the vision? Verses
44, 45.


   15. What acknowledgment came from the king? What action did
he take? Verses 46-49.
    NOTE.—"As God called Daniel to witness for Him in Babylon, so He calls
us to be His witnesses in the world today. In the smallest as well as the largest
affairs of life, He desires us to reveal to men the principles of His kingdom.
Many are waiting for some great work to be brought to them, while daily they
lose opportunities for revealing faithfulness to God. Daily they fail of dis-
charging with wholeheartedness the little duties of life. While they wait for
some large work in which they may exercise supposedly great talents, and thus
satisfy their ambitious longings, their days pass away."—Prophets and Kings,
pages 487, 488.



                        Lesson 2, for July 8, 1944
           The Fiery Furnace; Its Significance
     LESSON SCRIPTURE: Daniel 3.
     MEMORY VERSE: "When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee;
and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the
fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee." Isa. 43:2.
     STUDY HELP: "Prophets and Kings," pages 503-513.

                          A   Golden Image Set Up
   1. What image did Nebuchadnezzar set up on the plain of Dura?
Dan. 3:1.
    NOTE.—"The words, 'Thou art this head of gold,' had made a deep im-
pression upon the ruler's mind. The wise men of his realm, taking advantage of
this and of his return to idolatry, proposed that he make an image similar to
the one seen in his dream, and set it up where all might behold the head of
gold, which had been interpreted as representing his kingdom.
    "Pleased with the flattering suggestion, he determined to carry it out, and
to go even farther. Instead of reproducing the image as he had seen it, he
would excel the original. His image should not deteriorate in value from the
head to the feet, but should be entirely of gold,—symbolic throughout of Baby-
lon as an eternal, indestructible, all-powerful kingdom, which should break in
pieces all other kingdoms, and stand forever."—Prophets and Kings, page 504.
                                        [5 ]
   2. How many did the king order to be present at the dedication
of this image? Verses 2, 3.


  3. To ensure the recognition by the entire nation of the perpetual
sovereignty of Babylon, what did the king command? Verses 4-6.


   4. How many obeyed the command of the king? Verse 7.


          God's Servants Disobey the King's Command
  5. Who came near and accused the Jews of failure to obey the
king's command? After repeating the king's orders, whom did they
specifically accuse? Verses 8-12.


  6. What effect did this accusation have upon Nebuchadnezzar?
When the three men were brought before the king, what question
did he ask them? Verses 13, 14.


   7. What opportunity to recant did he give them? When thus
addressed, what was their bold reply? Verses 15-18.
    NorE.—"In vain were the king's threats. He could not turn the men from
their allegiance to the Ruler of the universe. From the history of their fathers
they had learned that disobedience to God results in dishonor, disaster, and
death ; and that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, the foundation
of all true prosperity."—Prophets and Kings, pages 507, 508.


  8. How did this reply affect the king? Verse 19, first part.


                         Into the Fiery Furnace
  9. How fully did the king prej,are to ensure that these rebellious
subjects should be consumed? Verses 19, last part, 20.


   10. With what care were they bound? What was the effect of the
fire upon the men who cast the three worthies into the furnace?
Verses 21, 22.
                                     [6]
   11. When the three men fell down bound in the midst of the
furnace, what development took place? What startled the king?,
Verses 23, 24.
    NoTE.—"But the Lord did not forget His own. As His witnesses were cast •
into the furnace, the Saviour revealed Himself to them in person, and together
they walked in the midst of the fire. In the presence of the Lord of heat and
cold, the flames lost their power to consume."—Prophets and Kings, pages
508, 509.


   12. What three things deeply impressed the mind of the king?
Whom was the fourth figure like? Verse 25.
    NorE.—"How did that heathen king know what the Son of God was like?
The Hebrew captives filling positions of trust in Babylon had in life and
character represented before him the truth. When asked for a reason of their
faith, they had given it without hesitation. Plainly and simply they had pre-
sented the principles of righteousness, thus teaching those around them of the
God whom they worshiped. They had told of Christ, the Redeemer to come;
and in the form of the fourth in the midst of the fire the king recognized the
Son of God."—Prophets and Kings, page 509.

                      Deliverance and Promotion
  13. By whom and in what way were the three worthies called
forth from the furnace? How many observed their condition?
Verses 26, 27.

14. What blessing did Nebuchadnezzar pronounce on their God?
What decree followed? Verses 28, 29.

  15. Instead of disgrace, what favor was shown these men? Verse
30.

   16. What assurance is given to God's people today? Matt. 24:13;
Rev. 2:7.
    NcrrE.—"As in the days of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, so in the
dosing period of earth's history the Lord will work mightily in behalf of those
who stand steadfastly for the right. He who walked with the Hebrew worthies
in the fiery furnace will be with His followers wherever they are. His abiding
presence will comfort and sustain. In the midst of the time of trouble,—
trouble such as has not been since there was a nation,—His chosen ones will
stand unmoved. Satan with all the hosts of evil cannot destroy the weakest
of God's saints. Angels that excel in strength will protect them, and in their
behalf Jehovah will reveal Himself as a 'God of gods,' able to save to the
uttermost those who have put their trust in Him."—Prophets and Kings,
page 513.
                                     [7]
                     Lesson 3, for July 15, 1944
    A King's Pride Humbled; the Handwriting
                   on the Wall
      LESSON SCRIPTURE: Daniel 4; 5.
      MEMORY VERSE: "The Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth
it to whomsoever He will." Dan. 4:25, last part.
      STUDY HELP: "Prophets and Kings," pages 514-538.

                   A King's Pride Humbled
  1. With what acknowledgment of God's wisdom and power does
Nebuchadnezzar introduce the experience whereby he was humbled
by the Lord? Dan. 4:1-3.

  2. What was Nebuchadnezzar's state when God spoke to him in a
dream? What effect did the dream have upon him? For whom did
he call? Verses 4-7.

  3. Who was finally called to interpret the dream? What name
had the king given Daniel? What did the king acknowledge con-
cerning Daniel? Verses 8, 9.

  4. What had the king seen in his dream? Verses 10-12.


   5. When the holy Watcher came down from heaven, what did He
command? What part of the tree was to be left? What indicates
that the subject of the dream was a man? What change was to come
to the individual and for how long? Verses 13-16.


  6. What importance to himself and his subjects did Nebuchad-
nezzar recognize in the dream? Why did the king call upon Daniel
for help? Verses 17, 18.

   7. How was Daniel affected by the dream? With what words did
the king encourage Daniel to explain the dream? What answer did
Daniel give? Verses 19-23.
    NorE.—"To Daniel the meaning of the dream was plain, and its significance
startled him. . . . The prophet realized that upon him God had laid the solemn
duty of revealing to Nebuchadnezzar the judgment that was about to fall upon
him because of his pride and arrogance. Daniel must interpret the dream in
                                    [8 ]
language the king could understand; and although its dreadful import had
made him hesitate in dumb amazement, yet he must state the truth, whatever
the consequences to himself."—Prophets and Kings, page 517.


  8. What was the explanation of the dream? Why had God given
the dream to the king? Verses 24-26.

  9. What counsel did Daniel give the king? How long afterward
was the king, in his pride, found boasting? What did the voice from
heaven say? What immediate change came to Nebuchadnezzar?
Verses 27-33.

10. At the end of the period what experience came to the king?
How did he express his regard for the God of heaven? Verses 34-37.
    NOTE.—The Jewish historian Josephus tells the story of Nebuchadnezzar's
dream and subsequent humiliation, using the expression "seven years," for the
"seven times" of verses 16 and 25 of Daniel 4. Thus is confirmed the interpre-
tation of the prophetic period of a "time and times and the dividing of time," as
used in chapter 7:25, where a "time" is used to symbolize a literal year.


                 The Handwriting on the Wall
  11. In the days of Belshazzar, the last king of Babylon, what great
feast did he make? Who were invited? While the revelers drank
and desecrated the vessels of the temple, whom did they praise? Dan.
5:1-4.
   NoTE.—Following Nebuchadnezzar, Evilmerodach his son reigned for a
short time. Finally Nabonidus, the son-in-law of Nebuchadnezzar, took the
throne. Belshazzar, the son of Nabonidus, later reigned conjointly with his
father.

  12. What mysterious vision suddenly caught the eye of the king?
How deeply was he affected? For whom did he call? What reward
did he offer his wise men? Verses 5-8.

  13. What effect did the failure of the wise men have on the king
and his lords? What counsel did the queen give to the king? Verses
9-12.

                 Daniel Called to Interpret

Belshazzar make and what promises of reward? Verses 13-16.
                                       [9]
  15. What answer did Daniel give the king? Verse 17.


  16. As Daniel recalled the experiences of the past, what did he
say Belshazzar had not done? What did he say the king had done
that was wrong? Verses 18-23.

17. What words had been written on the wall? What did each
mean? Verses 24-28.


  18. How fully was the king's promise of preferment carried out?
Verse 29.

  19. How swiftly did retribution come to Belshazzar? Who took
the kingdom? Verses 30, 31.


                     Lesson 4, for July 22, 1944
                   A Prime Minister Tested
    LESSON SCRIPTURE: 'Daniel 6.
    MEMORY VERSE: "My God bath sent His angel, and hath shut the lions'
mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before Him innocency was found
in me." Dan. 6:22.
    STUDY HELP: "Prophets and Kings," pages 339-548.

                  Seeking Occasion for Accusation
  1. What high office was Daniel given in the Medo-Persian king-
dom? Why was Daniel preferred above others? Dan. 6:1-3.
    NorE.—In the first five chapters of the book of Daniel is given an account
of Daniel and his companions in the Babylonian kingdom. With the overthrow
of Babylon Daniel became subject to the new world power. It was a testimony
to the faithfulness and integrity of Daniel for the king of the succeeding
empire to put him in this high office. Daniel, as chief of the three presidents
who were over the one hundred twenty princes, was directly responsible to the
king to see that no loss or damage came to the ruler.



  2. According to the testimony of his enemies, how faithful was
Daniel? In what particular did they hope to find occasion against
him? Verses 4, 5.
                              [ 10 ]
  3. What plan was laid by his subordinates to destroy Daniel?
What punishment was to be given anyone who disobeyed the sug-
gested decree? Verses 6, 7.


   4. Not understanding the motives which prompted the writing
of the decree, what did the king do? Verses 8, 9.


   5. What power was working through these enemies of Daniel
and why?
   Answer: "In the conspiracy thus formed, Satan had played an important
part. The prophet was high in command in the kingdom, and evil angels
feared that his influence would weaken their control over its rulers. It was
these satanic agencies who had stirred the princes to envy and jealousy; it was
they who had inspired the plan for Daniel's destruction; and the princes,
yielding themselves as instruments of evil, carried it into effect."—Prophets
and Kings, page 540.


              Daniel's Decision and Its Consequences
   6. Although Daniel knew the decree had been signed, what did
he do? Verse 10.
    NOTE.—"The prophet's enemies counted on Daniel's firm adherence to
principle for the success of their plan. And they were not mistaken in their
estimate of his character. He quickly read their malignant purpose in framing
the decree, but he did not change his course in a single particular."—Prophets
and Kings, pages 540, 541.


   7. What clear distinction between duties to God and duties to
earthly governments did Daniel follow in his decision?
    Answer: "Although he knew full well the consequences of his fidelity to
God, his spirit faltered not. Before those who were plotting his ruin, he would
not allow it even to appear that his connection with Heaven was severed. In
all cases where the king had a right to command, Daniel would obey; but
neither the king nor his decree could make him swerve from allegiance to the
King of kings. Thus the prophet boldly yet quietly and humbly declared that
no earthly power has a right to interpose between the soul and God."—
Prophets and Kings, page 542.


  8. After the princes had seen Daniel praying, what question did
they ask the king? What charge did they make against Daniel?
Verses 11-13.
   9. How did the words of the princes affect the king? What did
he endeavor to do? What rule of the Medo-Persian kingdom was
cited as a reason why the punishment should be meted out? Verses
14, 15.


   10. When the king ordered Daniel placed in the lions' den, what
statement of assurance did he make to his faithful servant? Verse 16.


               The King's Unrest—Deliverance
  11. After the king sealed the den with his own seal, what did he
do? Verses 17, 18.


  12. How did the king address Daniel when he called to him early
the next morning, and what was his question? Verses 19, 20.


  13. With what respectful words did Daniel answer the king?
How fully had God protected him? How did Daniel declare his
blameless conduct in his duties to his God and to his king? Verses
21-23.


          His Accusers Punished—God Exalted
  14. How were the accusers of the prophet punished? Verse 24.

  15. How extensively was the knowledge of the true God spread
as a result of this experience? Verses 25-28.
    NOTE.—"God did not prevent Daniel's enemies from casting him into the
lions' den; He permitted evil angels and wicked men thus far t6 accomplish
their purpose; but it was that He might make the deliverance of His servant
more marked, and the defeat of the enemies of truth and righteousness more
complete. 'Surely the wrath of man shall praise Thee,' the psalmist has testi-
fied. Through the courage of this one man who chose to follow right rather
than policy, Satan was to be defeated, and the name of God was to be exalted
and honored."—Prophets and Kings, pages 543, 544.


  16. What lesson may we learn from this experience?
   Answer: "From the story of Daniel's deliverance, we may learn that in
seasons of trial and gloom, God's children should be just what they were when
their prospects were bright with hope and their surroundings all that they
                                    [ 12 ]
could desire. Daniel in the lions' den was the same Daniel who stood before
the king as chief among the ministers of state and as a prophet of the Most
High. A man whose heart is stayed upon God will be the same in the hour of
his greatest trial as he is in prosperity, when the light and favor of God and
of man beam upon him. Faith reaches to the unseen, and grasps eternal

Day in the Light of Prophecy," pages 117-157.

                     A Vision of the Night
  1. When Daniel was given the vision of Daniel 7, what king was
on the throne of Babylon? In the vision, what first attracted the
prophet's attention? What was seen coming up out of the sea?
Dan. 7:1-3.
    Nom—This vision was given about 540 B. c. Chronologically it precedes
the fifth chapter of Daniel. This is the same Belshazzar mentioned in that
chapter. The first six chapters of the book of Daniel deal particularly with
the kingdom of Babylon while the last half of the book deals with prophecies
concerning the history of future nations of the world.



  2. In symbolic language in the Bible what do winds, sea, and
beasts represent?
   Answer: Winds represent strife and commotion. Jer. 25:31-33. Sea is a
symbol of peoples and tongues. Rev. 17:15. Beasts stand for kingdoms. Dan.
7:17.


  3. What peculiar characteristics were particularly mentioned in
the description of each beast? What four world empires were sym-
bolized by them? Verses 4-7.
    Nora.—The history of nations covered in these verses is the same as covered
in Daniel 2. The lion—Babylon, 606-538; the bear—Medo-Persia, 538-331;
the leopard—Grecia, 331-168; the fourth beast—Rome, 168 B. C. to A. D. 476.


               The Ten Horns and the Little Horn
  4. What was represented by the ten horns of the fourth beast?
Verse 24, first part.
                                       [ 13 ]
    NorE.—"We look to the history of the Roman Empire, and what do we
see?—Just the picture of the prophecy. We see the original Roman Empire of
the West divided into lesser kingdoms. We see the barbarian peoples of the
north sweeping down upon the empire, breaking it up, and establishing within
its boundaries the various kingdoms that are to this day represented by the
kingdoms of Western Europe."—Our Day in the Light of Prophecy, page 127.
    "Rome was divided into ten kingdoms, enumerated as follows: The Huns
[some expositors list the Alamanni instead of the Huns], the Ostrogoths, the
Visigoths, the Franks, the Vandals, the Suevi, the Burgundians, the Heruli, the
Anglo-Saxons, and the Lombards. These divisions have ever since been spoken
of as the ten kingdoms of the Roman Empire."—Daniel and the Revelation,
page 132.

  5. What came up and uprooted three of the horns? What special
characteristics did Daniel see in this new power? Verse 8.


                      The Judgment Sits
  6. As the prophet watched, what was the next great scene that
commanded his attention? Verses 9, 10.


  7. After viewing the great judgment and the results, how was
Daniel affected? What request did he make, and with what response?
Verses 15, 16.


       "I Would Know the Truth of the Fourth Beast"
  8. What part of the vision did Daniel want to understand more
fully? What had especially attracted his attention to the little horn?
Verses 19-21.
   NoTE.—"Wonderful was all this to the prophet; but something still more
wonderful appeared. A little horn came up, and, true to the nature of the beast
from which it sprang, thrust aside three of its fellows; and lo ! the horn had
eyes, not the uncultivated eyes of a brute, but the keen, shrewd, intelligent eyes
of a man; and, stranger yet, it had a mouth, and with that mouth it uttered
proud sayings, and put forth preposterous and arrogant claims."—Daniel and
the Revelation, page 138.



  9. What specific things would the "little horn power" do? How
long a time was its power to continue unbroken? Verse 25.


  10. What power meets the specifications of this power?
                                      [ 14 ]
      Answer: The question arises, What power has ever arisen in Europe since
 the fifth century which will meet all the specifications of Daniel 7:25? There
 is but one, the papacy. Most Protestants are agreed in this. (1) The papacy
 arose in Europe and made Rome its headquarters. (2) Her power was recog-
 nized after the Roman Empire was divided into ten kingdoms.. (3) Three of
 the original ten kingdoms, which were Arian in religion, and opposed to the
 claims of the bishop of Rome,—the Heruli in A. D. 493, the Vandals in 534, and
 the Ostrogoths in 538,—were successively overthrown before the rising power
 of the popes. (4) Beginning in the year 538 A. n., when the last of these oppos-
 ing powers was overthrown, and counting 1260 years, brings us to 1798, at
 which time, by the power arid authority of France, the then ruling papal pon-
 tiff was dethroned, and hay was proclaimed a republic. (5) During this 1260-
 year period, known av the Dark Ages, the Christian world was practically
 under the power of the papacy, and it literally wore out many millions of those
 whom it was pleased to call heretics, but whom God calls in Daniel 7:25 "the
saints." (6) Mile papacy has thought to change God's times and law, as the
 following, quoted from one of its own works, will prove: "The pope is of so
great a uthority and power, that he can even modify, explain and interpret the
divtne laws."—Ferraris' Prompta Bibliotheca, art. "Papa, II" in the Venice
edition of 1772, vol. 6, p. 29. It has expunged, in much of its teaching, the
second commandment, which forbids the worship of images. It has attempted
to change the Sabbath from the seventh to the first day of the week, and this
has been accepted by most of the Christian world. (7) It differs from other
European powers, being ecclesiastical as well as civil. (8) It has assumed the
titles and honors which belong only to God, and this is blasphemy.



   11. By what name is this same system designated by John the
revelator? Rev. 17:5, 6.
    Nom.—"This prophecy [of John's] Is more definite than others applicable
to the Roman power, in that it distinguishes between church and state. We
here have the woman, the church, seated upon a scarlet-colored beast, the civil
power, by which she is upheld, and which she controls and guides to her own
ends, as a rider controls the animal upon which he is seated."—Daniel and the
Revelation, comment on Rev. 17:1-5.
    In Daniel's prophecy, we have the ten horns and the little horn which
should speak great words against the Most High and wear out the saints of the
Most High ; in John's prophecy, we have the ten horns on the beast and the
names of blasphemy, also the woman drunken with the blood of saints. ,



12. What sentence was pronounced upon this power in the judg-
ment? Dan. 7:26.


  13. What then will be given to the saints? How long will this
kingdom continue? Verse 27.

                       The Ram and the He-coat
   1. The year that Babylon -fell, what did Daniel see in vision?
What special features of each of the beasts are mentioned? Dan.
8:1-7.
    NOTE.—"The first year of Belshazzar was B. C. 540. His mird year, in
which this vision was given, would consequently be 538. If Daniel, a. is sup-
posed, was about twenty years of age when he was carried to Babylon in the
first year of Nebuchadnezzar, B. C. 606, he was at this time about eighty-eight
years of age."—Daniel and the Revelation, pages 163, 165.


  2. When the goat became strong, what happened to the horn be-
tween his eyes? What took its place? Verse 8.


   3. What countries were represented by the ram and the goat?
What did the horns represent? Verses 20-22.
   NOTE.—"The distinguishing feature of the Persian Empire, the union of
the two nationalities which composed it, is represented by the two horns of
the ram. Grecia attained its greatest glory as a unit under the leadership of
Alexander the Great, a general as famous as the world has ever seen. This
part of her history is represented by the first phase of the goat, during which
time the one notable horn symbolized Alexander the Great. Upon his death,
the kingdom fell into fragments, but soon consolidated into four grand
divisions, represented by the second phase of the goat, when it had four horns
which came up in the place of the first, which was broken. These divisions
did not stand in his power. None of them possessed the strength of the original
kingdom."—Daniel and the Revelation, pages 202, 203.
   Within the space of twenty-three years after Alexander's death there were
just four; namely, Cassander, Lysimachus, Seleucus, and Ptolemy.

                      A Little Horn Becomes Great
   4. What power was represented by the little horn which became
great? What did this power do? Verses 9-12, 23-25.
   NOTE.—"The little horn, springing out of the western part of the four di-
visions, was none other than Rome; for this kingdom was to wax exceeding
great, greater than all the kingdoms before it. This horn is a symbol of both
Rome imperial, or pagan, and Rome papal; for both carried on a relentless
                                       I. 16 ]
persecution against the people of God."—Bible Readings, ch. "The Prophetic
Symbols of Daniel 8."

   5. As Daniel beheld the persecuting work of the little horn of
Daniel 7, what great event took place? What happened to the per-
secuting power? Dan. 7:26.
    NorE.—"In the prophecy of the seventh chapter, there is traced the his-
tory of the rise and fall of the four great kingdoms, the division of the fourth,
as represented by the ten horns, and the establishment of the papacy under
the symbol of the little horn, before whom three fell. . . .
    "The eighth chapter of Daniel reviews briefly the history of the kingdoms,
predicts the persecutions of the chosen people by pagan and papal Rome, and
gives a remarkable prophecy of the sanctuary, locating the beginning of the
investigative judgment."—Bible Readings, ch. "The Prophetic Symbols of
Daniel 8."

                     Understanding Given Daniel
   6. In answer to the question asked, what long time prophecy
regarding the sanctuary was brought to Daniel? Dan. 8:13, 14.
   NorE.—"The Jewish Day of Atonement was on the tenth day of the seventh
month, at which time the sanctuary was cleansed. This Day of Atonement was
looked upon by the Jews as a day of judgment, and was, in fact, a type of
the investigative judgment in heaven. The 2300-day period, representing 2300
years according to symbolic prophecy, reaches to the cleansing of the sanctuary
in heaven, or the investigative judgment. A study of the symbols and time
period of this chapter, and of their interpretation in this and the ninth chapter
gives a clear understanding of this period."—Bible Readings, ch. "The Pro-
phetic Symbols of Daniel 8."

   7. As Daniel sought for an understanding, who was instructed to
explain the vision? To what time did the angel say the vision
belongs? Verses 15-19.
    NOTE.—"Since in prophecy a symbolic day represents a literal year (Ezek.
4:6), the 2300-day period would extend down into the time of the end. In the
preceding chapter the 1260 years of papal supremacy were seen to terminate
in 1798, at which time, according to Daniel 12:4, 6, 7, the time of the end was
to begin."—Bible Readings, ch. "The Prophetic Symbols of Daniel 8."


  8. When Daniel saw the stirring events which were to bring per-
secution to God's people and desolation to the Holy City and sanctu-
ary, how was he affected? Verse 27.

  9. While Daniel studied the prophecies of Jeremiah regarding
the captivity, and earnestly prayed and fasted, what heavenly mes-
senger came to him? Why did he say he had come? What word of
                                      L17]
encouragement did he bring the distressed prophet? Dan. 9:1-3,
20-23.
    NOTE.—"This vision was given in the third year of the reign of Belshazzar,
or in 538• B. c. There followed the overthrow of Babylon by Media and Persia;
and it was in the first year of the reign of Darius, also in 538 B. c., when the
interpretation of the vision was completed, as recorded in the ninth chapter."
Bible Readings, ch. "The Prophetic Symbols of Daniel 8."



   10. What part of the vision had not been explained?
   Answer: The time period.



                          "Unto 2300 Days"
   11. What part of the 2300 days was allotted to the Jews? What
was to be accomplished during that period? Dan. 9:24.
    NoTE.—"The seventy weeks therefore were determined, or cut off. There
are two periods of time under consideration, the first the 2300-day period, the
second the seventy-week period. They both had to do with the restoration of
the Jewish people and the sanctuary, for the Jews were in captivity and the
sanctuary was in ruins. The two periods must then begin with the restoration,
and at the same time. The full restoration of the Jewish laws and government
pertaining to the people and their sanctuary took place in 457 B. c."—Bible
Readings, ch. "The Hour of God's Judgment."



   12. How many weeks after the command to rebuild Jerusalem
are there to Messiah the Prince? What events were to take place
during the last week of the time allotted to the Jews? Thereafter,
how much of the 2300 days or years remained? Verses 25-27.
    NOTE.—"As the sixty-nine weeks ended in the fall of 27 A. D., the middle
of the seventieth week, or the three and a half years, would end in the spring
of 31 A. D., when Christ was crucified, and by His death caused to cease, or
brought to an end, the sacrifices and oblations of the earthly sanctuary. Three
and a half years more (the last part of the seventieth week) would end in the
autumn of 34 A. D. This brings us to the end of the 490 years which were 'cut
off' from the 2300. There still remain 1810 years, which, if added to 34 A. D.,
take us to 1844 A. u."—Bible Readings, ch. "The Hour of God's Judgment."



   13. What did the angel say would take place at the end of 2300
days? Dan. 8:14.
   Nora.—In other words, the great closing work of Christ for the world, the
atonement, or the investigative judgment, would at that time begin.

issue a decree providing for the massacre of all the Jews 'scattered abroad and
dispersed among the people in all the provinces' of the Medo-Persian kingdom.
A certain day was appointed on which the Jews were to be destroyed and their
property confiscated. Little did the king realize the far-reaching results that
would have accompanied the complete carrying out of this decree. Satan
himself, the hidden instigator of the scheme, was trying to rid the earth of
those who preserved the knowledge of the true God."—Prophets and Kings,

    "The crisis that Esther faced demanded quick, earnest action; but both she

his birth, the manner in which Babylon should be taken; as he read the mes-

as they thought of the results of long-continued impenitence. Had they and

would not have been necessary. But because of ingratitude and disloyalty
they had been scattered among the heathen."—Prophets and Kings, page 564.


                           Offers of Assistance
   7. Who offered to help rebuild the temple? What argument did
they advance as a reason why they should help? What answer did
they receive and why? Ezra 4:1-3.
    NoTE.—"Had the Jewish leaders accepted this offer of assistance, they
would have opened a door for the entrance of idolatry. They discerned the
insincerity of the Samaritans."
    "There is constant danger that professing Christians will come to think

    NoTz.—"During the reign of Cambyses, the work on the temple progressed
slowly. And during the reign of the false Smerdis (called Artaxerxes in Ezra
4:7), the Samaritans induced the unscrupulous imposter to issue a decree for-
bidding the Jews to rebuild their temple and city.
    "For over a year the temple was neglected, and well-nigh forsaken. The
people dwelt in their homes, and strove to attain temporal prosperity; but
their situation was deplorable. Work as they might, they did not prosper. The
very elements of nature seemed to conspire against them. Because they had
let the temple lie waste, the Lord sent upon their substance a wasting drought
God had bestowed upon them the fruits of field and garden, the corn and thi
wine and the oil, as a token of His favor; but because they had used these
bountiful gifts so selfishly, the blessings were removed."—Prophets and Kings,

command to restore the temple and to rebuild Jerusalem. These are (1) the
decree of Cyrus for the rebuilding of the house of God, B. c. 536 (Ezra 1:1-4) ;
(2) the decree of Darius for the prosecution of that work, which had been
hindered, B. c. 519 (Ezra 6:1-12) ; and (3) the decree of Artaxerxes to Ezra
B. c. 457 (Ezra 7). This final decree made the plan operative and effective,
and is the accepted date for the beginning of the 2300-day period of Daniel 9.


  15. Where did Ezra go, and who went with him? What special
favor did the king grant Ezra? How did Ezra express his gratitude
for all these favors? Ezra 7:6-28.

the decree of Cyrus given years before. Artaxerxes now granted permission
to those who desired to return to Jerusalem. They were permitted to take
gold and silver and freewill offerings and vessels for the temple. Besides this
they were given wheat, wine, oil, salt, and money. Permission was also granted
to set up magistrates and judges with power to act.

keep separate from the nations surrounding them, they would have been spared
many sad and humiliating experiences. Now when he learned that notwith-
standing the lessons of the past, men of prominence had dared transgress the
laws given as a safeguard against apostasy, his heart was stirred within him.
He thought of God's goodness in again giving His people a foothold in their
native land, and he was overwhelmed with righteous indignation and with
grief at their ingratitude."—Prophets and Kings, page 620.

Neh. 1:1-4, 11.
    NoTE.—"By messengers from Judea, the Hebrew patriot learned that days
of trial had come to Jerusalem, the chosen city. The returned exiles were suffer-
ing affliction and reproach.e htemple and portions of the city had been re-
built; but the work of restoration was hindered, the temple services were
disturbed, and the people kept in constant alarm, by the fact that the walls
of the city were still largely in ruins. Overwhelmed with sorrow, Nehemiah
could neither eat nor drink; he 'wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted.' "
 —Prophets and Kings, pages 628, 629.

   8. What did Nehemiah immediately urge upon the people? What
 was their response? Who ridiculed and accused them? What was
 Nehemiah's courageous reply? Verses 17-20.
    NOTE.—"Having shown that he was sustained by the combined authority of
the God of Israel and the Persian king, Nehemiah asked the people directly
whether they would take advantage of this opportunity, and arise and build
the wall.
    "The appeal went straight to their hearts. The thought of how Heaven's
favor had been manifested toward them, put their fears to shame, and with
new courage they said with one voice, 'Let us rise up and build.' So they
strengthened their hands for this good work.' "—Prophets and Kings, page 638.


  9. What impressive description is g;-,-en of the united effort of all

Nehemiah discover concerning this advice from false friends?
Verses 10-14.
   Nom.—"Had Nehemiah followed this treacherous counsel, he,would have
sacrificed his faith in God, and in the eyes of the people he would have
appeared cowardly and contemptible. In view of the important work that
he had undertaken, and the confidence that he professed to have in the power
of God, it would have been altogether inconsistent for him to hide as if in
fear. The alarm would have spread among the people, each would have
sought his own safety, and the city would have been left unprotected, to fall
a prey to its enemies." — Prophets and Kings, page 655.

the dedication? Who joined in the dedication? Neh. 12:27, 43.

  1. At the celebration of the Feast of Trumpets in Jerusalem, what
request came to Ezra from the people? Neh. 8:1.


  2. Who were included in the congregation? How long did Ezra
read? What was the attitude of the people? Verses 2, 3.
   NOTE.—"Through the intermarriage of the people with other nations, the
Hebrew language had become corrupted, and great care was necessary on the
part of the speakers to explain the law in the language of the people, that it
might be understood by all. Certain of the priests and Levites united with
Ezra in explaining the principles of the law."—Prophets and Kings, pages
661, 662.

  3. While reading where did Ezra stand? Before reading, what
did Ezra do? How did the people respond? Verses 4-7.

brating the Feast of Tabernacles? Verses 13-18.


   7. What special service was held on the twenty-fourth day of the
first month? Neh. 9:1-3.
    NOTE.—"As they had listened from day to day to the words of the law, the
people had been convicted of their transgressions, and of the sins of their nation
in past generations. They saw that it was because of a departure from God
that His protecting care had been withdrawn, and that the children of Abra-
                                      E
ham had been scattered in foreign lands; and they determined to seek His
mercy, and to pledge themselves to walk in His commandments. Before enter-
ing upon this solemn service, held on the second day after the close of the
Feast of Tabernacles, they separated themselves from the heathen among them.
   "As the people prostrated themselves before the Lord, confessing their
sins and pleading for pardon, their leaders encouraged them to believe that
God, according to His promise, heard their prayers. They must not only mourn
and weep, and repent, but they must believe that God pardoned them. They
must show their faith by recounting His mercies and praising Him for His
goodness."—Prophets and Kings, pages 665, 666.


                   Reforms Are Inaugurated
  8. In establishing the service of the temple, who had been for-
gotten and neglected? What was done to change the situation?
What did the people of Judah do? Neh. 13:10-13.



   9. What did Nehemiah see being done on the Sabbath? What
steps did he take to stop this evil? Verses 15-19.
    NOTE.—"Another result of intercourse with idolaters was a disregard of the
Sabbath, the sign distinguishing the Israelites from all other nations as wor-
shipers of the true God. Nehemiah found that heathen merchants and traders
from the surrounding country, coming to Jerusalem, had induced many among
the Israelites to engage in traffic on the Sabbath. There were some who could
not be persuaded to sacrifice principle; but others transgressed, and joined
with the heathen in their efforts to overcome the scruples of the more con-
scientious. Many dared openly to violate the Sabbath."—Prophets and Kings,
page 671.


  10. Where did the merchants and others who sold produce lodge?
What threat did Nehemiah make? What was the result? Verses
20, 21.


   11. What other evil had crept in among the priests and people?
Was Nehemiah able to remedy the situation? Verses 23-30.
    NOTE.—"There were some in sacred offices who pleaded for their heathen
wives, declaring that they could not bring themselves to separate from them.
But no distinction was made; no respect was shown for rank or position. . . .
   "How much anguish of soul this needed severity cost the faithful worker
for God, the judgment alone will reveal. There was a constant struggle with
opposing elements; and only by fasting, humiliation, and prayer, was advance-
ment made. Many who had married idolaters chose to go with them into
exile; and these, with those who had been expelled from the congregation,
joined the Samaritans."—Prophets and Kings, page 674.
                                   [28 1
   12. What would have kept Israel from idolatry?
    Answer: "The Lord designed that by a faithful observance of the Sabbath
command, Israel should continually be reminded of their accountability to Him
as their Creator and their Redeemer. While they should keep the Sabbath in
the proper spirit, idolatry could not exist; but should the claims of this pre-
cept of the Decalogue be set aside as no longer binding, the Creator would
be forgotten, and men would worship other gods."—Prophets. and Kings,
page 182.


   13. What work is to be done by God's people in the last days?
    Answer: "God's memorial, the seventh-day Sabbath, the sign of His work
in creating the world, has been displaced by the man of sin. God's people have
a special work to do in repairing the breach that has been made in His law; and
the nearer we approach the end, the more urgent this work becomes. All who
love God will show that they bear His sign by keeping His commandments."—
Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 265.

             From Ancient Days a Deliverer Predicted
   1. To whom was the first promise made concerning the coming
Deliverer? Gen. 3:15.
    NOTE.—"The first intimation of such a hope was given to Adam and Eve
in the sentence pronounced upon the serpent in Eden, when the Lord declared
to Satan in their hearing, will put enmity between thee and the woman, and
between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise
his heel.'"—Prophets and Kings, page 681.
    "Heavenly angels more fully opened to our first parents the plan that had
been devised for their salvation. Adam and his companion were assured that
notwithstanding their great sin, they were not to be abandoned to the control
of Satan. The Son of God had offered to atone, with His own life, for their
transgression."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 66.         •


   2. Who was to receive a blessing through the seed of Abraham?
Gen. 12:3.
    NOTE.—"The hope of Israel was embodied in the promise made at the time
of the call of Abraham, and afterward repeated again and again to his pos-
terity. . . . When, at last, the Saviour Himself walked and talked among the
sons of men, He bore witness to the Jews of the patriarch's bright hope of
                                         ( 29]
deliverance through the coming of a Redeemer. 'Your father Abraham rejoiced
to see My day,' Christ declared; 'and he saw it, and was glad"'—Prophets
and Kings, page 683.


   3. When on his deathbed Jacob blessed his sons, how did he ex-
press his hope in a Deliverer? Gen. 49:10.
   NoTE.—The blessed hope was in Jacob's mind as he lay on his deathbed
and gave to his sons the parting blessing. He prophesied that through Judah
should Shiloh come. The lion, king of beasts, was a fitting symbol of the tribe
through which the "Son of David" would come, the "Lion of the tribe of
Judah" (Rev. 5:5), before whom all shall bow and to whom all will eventually
give homage.


   4. How is the Redeemer referred to in Deuteronomy? What in-
terpretation does the apostle Paul give to the Rock that guided
Israel? Deut. 32:18; 1 Cor. 10:4.


  5. What prophecy did Moses make concerning the coming of
Jesus? How was it fulfilled? Deut. 18:18, 19; Acts 3:22-24.


           The Sanctuary Service a Constant Reminder
   6. What services of the children of Israel constantly foreshadowed
the coming of the Deliverer? Heb. 9:11, 12.
    NorE.—"In patriarchal times the sacrificial offerings connected with divine
worship constituted a perpetual reminder of the coming of a Saviour; and thus
it was with the entire ritual of the sanctuary services throughout Israel's
history. In the ministration of the tabernacle, and of the temple that after-
ward took its place, the people were taught each day, by means of types and
shadows, the great truths relative to the advent of Christ as Redeemer, Priest,
and King; and once each year their minds were carried forward to the closing
events of the great controversy between Christ and Satan, the final purification
of the universe from sin and sinners."—Prophets and Kings, pages 684, 685.


  7. What prophecy of the Saviour was given by Balaam? Num.
24:17.
   Ncrra.—In Matthew 2:1, 2, 9,10 b recorded the fulfillment of this prophecy.

when He should appear? How does he speak of the work of the
Redeemer while among men? Ps. 118:22, 23; 40:6-10.

          The Latter Prophets Predicted His Coming
  91 How definitely are the circumstances of His birth predicted in
the Old Testament scriptures?
   Answer: The promise, Isa. 9:6, 7. The mother, a virgin, Isa. 7:14. Place
of birth, Micah 5:2. Time of birth, Dan. 9:24, 25. Fulfillment, Matt. 1:
21-23; 2:1.

  10. What prophecy was made concerning the forerunner of the
Messiah? In whom was this prophecy fulfilled? Isa. 40:3; John
1:19-23.
   NOTE.—When the Sanhedrin sent a delegation to confer with John at the
river Jordan, John interpreted the prophecy made by Isaiah concerning his
work. In answer to their questions John replied, "I am the voice of one cry-
ing in the wilderness." The message of John was to prepare the people for
Christ, and had their minds not been blinded by national pride and false
traditions they would have recognized the fulfillment of the prophecy.


  11. How dearly was the triumphal entry of the Messiah into
Jerusalem foretold? Where is the account of the fulfillment re-
corded? Zech. 9:9; Matt. 21:1-5.


12. What prophecy was made of His public ministry? Under
what conditions was it fulfilled? Isa. 61:1; Luke 4:16-18, 21.


   13. By what names does the prophet Jeremiah refer to Christ?
Jer. 23:5, 6.

   14. How did Isaiah speak of Christ and His work? Isa. 9:6, 7.


  15. What prophecy comprehensively relates the circumstances of
His rejection, sufferings, and death? Isa. 53:1-9.
    NorE.—"The steadfast among the Jewish nation, descendants of that holy
line through whom a knowledge of God had been preserved, strengthened
their faith by dwelling on these and similar passages. With exceeding joy
they read how the Lord would anoint One 'to preach good tidings unto the
meek,' to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives,' and
to declare the acceptable year of the Lord.' Yet their hearts were filled with
sadness as they thought of the sufferings He must endure in order to fulfill
the divine purpose. With deep humiliation of soul they traced the words in
the prophetic roll."—Prophets and Kings, pages 689, 690.

41-43; Matt. 1:20, 21.


  4. At His birth, to how large a circle was His coming made

   5. To whom was His identity made known soon after His birth?
   Answer: Simeon, Luke 2:25-32; Anna, verses 36, 38.
   Nal-E.—Had the priests and rulers studied the prophecies of Christ's first
advent with open minds and hearts, they would have known also, for they
had the prophetic books as had Simeon and Anna. The shepherds understood.
The wise men from their study were looking for His star and were ready to
accept Him.

                 Christ's Childhood and Youth
  6. What is said of the childhood and youth of Christ? Luke 2:40,
51, 52.
   NOTE.—"As He grew in wisdom and stature, Jesus increased in favor with
God and man. He drew the sympathy of all hearts by showing Himself
capable of sympathizing with all. The atmosphere of hope and courage that
surrounded Him made Him a blessing in every home. And often in the syna-
gogue on the Sabbath day He was called upon to read the lesson from the
prophets, and the hearts of the hearers thrilled as a new light shone out from
the familiar words of the sacred text.
   "Yet Jesus shunned display. During all the years of His stay in Nazareth,
He made no exhibition of His miraculous power. He sought no high position
                                       82 1
and assumed no titles. His quiet and simple life, and even the silence of the
Scriptures concerning His early years, teach an important lesson. The more
quiet and simple the life of the child,—the more free from artificial excitement,
and the more in harmony with nature,—the more favorable is it to physical
and mental vigor and to spiritual strength."—The Desire of Ages, page 74.


   7. How old was Jesus at the time of His baptism? When did He
begin His ministry? Matt. 3:13-17; Mark 1:14; Luke 3:23.
   NoTE.—Christ was about thirty years old (Luke 3:23) at the time of His
baptism, which was A. D. 27. Christ was born three or four years before the
beginning of the Christian Era, that is, before the year marked A. D. 1. He was
therefore thirty years of age in A. D. 27, the date of His baptism.


                         To a World in Darkness
   8. What was the condition in the world at the time of Christ?
What was the burden of His message? Matt. 4:16, 17.
    Answer: Repentance and reformation.
    NOTE.---"The deception of sin had reached its height. All the agencies for
depraving the souls of men had been put in operation. The Son of God, look-
ing upon the world, beheld suffering and misery. With pity He saw how men
had become victims of Satanic cruelty. He looked with compassion upon
those who were being corrupted, murdered, and lost. They had chosen a ruler
who chained them to his car as captives. Bewildered and deceived, they were
moving on in gloomy procession toward eternal ruin,—to death in which is
no hope of life, toward night to which comes no morning. Satanic agencies
were incorporated with men. The bodies of human beings, made for the
dwelling-place of God, had become the habitation of demons. The senses, the
nerves, the passions, the organs of men, were worked by supernatural agencies
in the indulgence of the vilest lust. The very stamp of demons was impressed
upon the countenances of men. Human faces reflected the expression of the
legions of evil with which they were possessed. Such was the prospect upon
which the world's Redeemer looked. What a spectacle for Infinite Purity to
behold !"—The Desire of Ages, page 36.


   9. In His ministry what work are we specifically told that He con-
stantly did? Matt. 4:23; Acts 10:38.          .
    NOTE —"Our Lord Jesus Christ came to this world as the unwearied servant
of man's necessity. He 'took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses,' that He
might minister to every need of humanity. The burden of disease and wretch-
edness and sin He came to remove. It was His mission to bring to men
complete restoration; He came to give them health and peace and perfection
of character.
    "Varied were the circumstances and needs of those who besought His aid,
and none who came to Him went away unhelped. From Him flowed a stream
of healing power, and in body and mind and soul men were made whole."—

  10. What did Jesus instruct His disciples to teach? What were
they to do? Matt. 10:7, 8.


                         Christ's Love for Men
   11. What was Christ's attitude toward those who followed Him?
John 13:1; 14:21; 17:26.
   Nors.—"His promise to those loved ones whom He leaves on earth is, 'I am
with you alway, even unto the end of the world.' Upon reaching the Mount of
Olives, Jesus led the way across the summit, to the vicinity of Bethany. Here
He paused, and the disciples gathered about Him. Beams of light seemed to
radiate from His countenance as He looked lovingly upon them. He upbraided
them not for their faults and failures; words of the deepest tenderness were
the last that fell upon their ears from the lips of their Lord."—The Desire
of Ages, page 830.


   12. Although Christ was deserted even by His disciples at the
time of His betrayal (Matt. 26:56, 75) how was His love demon-
strated? John 19:25-27.


  13. What promise concerning the Holy Spirit did Christ make to
His disciples while still with them? John 16:7, 13.


   14. What conditions are essential to the presence of Christ by the
Spirit in our hearts and lives? John 14:21.
   NOTE.-"All true obedience comes from the heart. It was heart work with
Christ. And if we consent, He will so identify Himself with our thoughts and
aims, so blend our hearts and minds into conformity to His will, that when
obeying Him we shall be but carrying out our own impulses. The will, refined
and sanctified, will find its highest delight in doing His service. When we
know God as it is our privilege to know Him, our life will be a life of continual
obedience. Through an appreciation of the character of Christ, through corn- •
munion with God, sin will become hateful to us."—The Desires of Ages,
page 668.

   15. What commission did Christ give to the church? What power
is promised the church for this work? Matt. 28:18-20.
    Ncrrz.—"From that scene of heavenly joy, there comes back to us on earth
the echo of Christ's own wonderful words, 'I ascend unto My Father, and your
Father; and to My God and your God.' The family of heaven and the family
of earth are one. For us our Lord ascended, and for us He lives. 'Wherefore
He is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by Him,
seeing He ever liveth to make intercession for them"'—The Desire of Ages,

of. David, who would establish the throne of David "forever." Not until
Jesus comes into His everlasting kingdom (see Daniel 7:13, 14), will this
prophecy be completely fulfilled. Then to Jesus, the Son of David, and the
Son of God, will be given the kingdom and the dominion and the glory, which
shall never pass away.

  2. How does the psalmist describe the coming of Christ in glory?
Who does he say will be gathered at that time? Who is declared to be

  3. How does Isaiah say the Lord will deal with the earth and trans-
gressors at His coming? Isa. 13:6, 9; 26:21.


   4. In what prophetic words does Ezekiel tell of the overturning
of the throne of David? Ezek. 21:25-27.


   5. What will be the lot of the ransomed in that hour? How will
they express the feelings of their hearts? Isa. 35:4, 10.
    NoTE.—"By the people of God a voice, clear and melodious, is heard, say-
ing 'Look up,' and lifting their eyes to the heavens, they behold the bow of
promise. The black, angry clouds that covered the firmament are parted, and
like Stephen they look up steadfastly into heaven, and see the glory of God, and
the. Son of man seated upon•His throne. In His divine form they discern the
marks of His humiliation; and from His lips they hear the request, presented
before His Father and the holy angels, 'I will that they also, whom Thou
hast given Me, be with Me where I am.' Agairea voice, musical and triumphant,
is heard, saying: 'They come I they come 1 holy, harmless, and undefiled. They
have kept the word of My patience; they shall walk among the angels;' and
the pale, quivering lips of those who have held fast their faith, utter a shout of
victory."—The Great Controversy, page 636.


  6. How definitely does Daniel tell the time when we may look for
the setting up of Christ's kingdom? What does he say of Christ's

   7. While the Saviour was on earth, what outstanding hope did He
set before His followers? John 14:1-3.


   8. By what means did Christ in His teaching endeavor to implant
in the minds of His hearers the message of His second coming?
   Answer: By parables: The ten virgins, Matt. 25:1-13; the talents, verses
14-30; the tares, Matt. 13:24-30, 36-43; the net, verses 47-50; the laborers in
the vineyard, Matt. 20:1-16; and others.


  9. How did Christ seek to impress upon His disciples the certainty
of His second coming? Matthew 24.


            His Disciples Constantly Mentioned It
10. In his letters to the church of Thessalonica, what did Paul
want them to know? 1 Thess. 4:13-17.


  11. How does Peter describe the day of Christ's second appearing?
2 Peter 3:9, 10.


  12. Following the three angels' messages as recorded by John,
how does he describe the coming of Christ? Rev. 14:14-16.


  13. What comforting message was given to the sorrowing dis-
ciples at the time of Christ's ascension? Acts 1:9-11.


  14. By what indisputable witnesses is the second coming of Christ
assured?
    Answer: Prophets (Dan. 12:1, 2; Job 19:25-27); apostles (1 Thess. 4:15-
17 ; 2 Peter 3:1-14) ; Christ (John 14:1-3 ; Matt. 24:3-31) ; and angels (Acts
1:10, 11).
   Nora.—Through all the Bible the second appearing of Christ is clearly
taught. The prophets, who foretold His first coming, also tell of His second
appearing. His disciples, who listened to His instruction and labored with
Him, taught that He would come again. Christ Himself definitely promised
that He would come again.

    MEMORY VERSE: "Israel shall be saved in the Lord with an everlasting
salvation: ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world without end." Isa. 45:17.
    STUDY HELPS: "Prophets and Kings," pages 722-733; "The Great Contro-
versy," pages 662-678 (new edition, pages 745-762).

                            The First Dominion
   1. What was the state of the earth when first created? What ex-
alted place was given man? How did he lose his Eden home? Gen.
1:25-31; 3:6, 16-19.
   NOTE.—"After their sin, Adam and Eve were no longer to dwell in Eden.
They earnestly entreated that they might remain in the hbme of their innocence
and joy. They confessed that they had forfeited all right to that happy abode,
but pledged themselves for the future to yield strict obedience to God. But .
they were told that their nature had become depraved by sin; they had lessened
their strength to resist evil, and had opened the way for Satan to gain more
ready access to them. In their innocence they had yielded to temptation; and
now, in a state of conscious guilt, they would have less power to maintain
their integrity."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 61.

   2. With whom did the rebellion against God begin? How will
it end? 1 John 3:8; Rev. 21:1, 4.
    NOTE.—"For six thousand years, Satan's work of rebellion has 'made the
earth to tremble.' He has 'made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the
cities thereof.' And 'he opened not the house of his prisoners.' For six thou-
sand years his prison house has received God's people, and he would have
held them captive forever, but Christ has broken his bonds, and set the
prisoners free."—The Great Controversy, page 659.

   3. What occurs when Christ comes the second time?
    Answer: Satan is bound. Rev. 20:1-3. The righteous dead are raised to
life and the living righteous are translated. 1 Thess. 4:16, 17. The wicked
living are destroyed by the brightness of Christ's coming. 2 Thess. 2:7, 8.

                      The Millennial Period
   4. What takes place during the thousand years? Rev. 20:4; 1 Cor.
6:1-3.


   5. At the close of the thousand years what takes place? Rev.
20:5, 7-9.
    NOTE.—"At the close of the thousand years, Christ again returns to the
earth. He is accompanied by the host of the redeemed, and attended ,by a
retinue of angels. As He descends in terrific majesty, He bids the wicked dead
arise to receive their doom. . . . Now Satan prepares for a last mighty struggle
for the supremacy. While deprived of his power, and cut off from his work
                                      [ 37 I
of deception, the prince of evil was miserable and dejected; but as the wicked
dead are raised, and he sees the vast multitudes upon his side, his hopes revive,
and he determines not to yield the great controversy. He will marshal all the
armies of the lost under his banner, and through them endeavor to execute his
plans."—The Great Controversy, pages 662, 663.

                            Sin Ended Forever
    6. What becomes of Satan and those who have followed him in
continued rebellion? Rev. 20:10, 14, 15.
    NoTE.—"The wicked receive their recompense in the earth. They 'shall be
stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts.'
Some are destroyed as in a moment, while others suffer many days. All are
punished 'according to their deeds.' The sins of the righteous having been
transferred to Satan, he is made to suffer not only for his own rebellion, but
for all the sins which he has caused God's people to commit. His punishment
is to be far greater than that of those whom he has deceived. After all have
perished who fell by his deceptions, he is still to live and suffer on. In the
cleansing flames the wicked are at last destroyed, root and branch,—Satan the
root, his followers the branches. The full penalty of the law has been visited;
the demands of justice have been met; and heaven and earth, beholding,
declare the righteousness of Jehovah."—The Great Controversy, page 673.

   7. When Satan and those who have followed him are destroyed,
what universal chorus of praise will be heard? Isa. 14:7; Rev. 5:13.
   Norm.—"Satan's work of ruin is forever ended. For six thousand years he
has wrought his will, filling the earth with woe, and causing grief throughout
the universe. The whole creation has groaned and travailed together in pain.
Now God's creatures are forever delivered from his presence and temptations.
`The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet: they [the righteous] break forth into
singing.' And a shout of praise and triumph ascends from the whole loyal
universe."—The Great Controversy, page 673.


  8. What promise did God make to Abraham? How much did this
promise comprehend? Did Abraham receive the fulfillment of this
promise? Gen. 13:14-17; Rom. 4:13; Acts 7:5.

   9. What was shown the apostle John regarding the earth? Rev.
21:1.
    NoTE.—"The fire that consumes the wicked purifies the earth. Every trace
of the curse is swept away. No eternally burning hell will keep before the
ransomed the fearful consequences of sin."—The Great Controversy, page 674.

  10. What does Isaiah say the redeemed will do in their beautiful
inheritance? Isa. 65:21-23.

   11. How readily will their needs be supplied? Verse 24.
                                      [33   ]
   12. What peaceful condition will then reign throughout the
earth? Verse 25.
   NOTE.—"Pain cannot exist in the atmosphere of heaven. There will be no
more tears, no funeral trains, no badges of mourning. . . . In the city of God
`there shall be no night.' None will need or desire repose. There will be no
weariness in doing the will of God and offering praise to His name. We shall
ever feel the freshness of the morning, and shall ever be far from its close."—
The Great Controversy, page 676.


   13. What seasons of worship will be observed in the new earth?
Isa. 35:10; 66:22, 23.
    NOTE.—"There the redeemed shall 'know, even as also they are known.'
The loves and sympathies which God Himself has planted in the soul, shall
there find truest and sweetest exercise. The pure communion with holy beings,
the harmonious social life with the blessed angels and with the faithful ones
of all ages, who have washed their robes and made them white in the blood
of the Lamb, the sacred ties that bind together 'the whole family in heaven and
earth,'—these help to constitute the happiness of the redeemed."—The Great
Controversy, page 677.


   14. What provision has been made for the mental and spiritual
development of the inhabitants of the restored kingdom?
    Answer: "All the treasures of the universe will be open to the study of
God's redeemed. Unfettered by mortality, they wing their tireless flight to
worlds afar,—worlds that thrilled with sorrow at the spectacle of human
woe, and rang with songs of gladness at the tidings of a ransomed soul. With
unutterable delight the children of earth enter into the joy and the wisdom of
unfallen beings. They share the treasures of knowledge and understanding
gained through ages upon ages in contemplation of God's handiwork. With
undimmed vision they gaze upon the glory of creation,—suns and stars and
systems, all in their appointed order circling the throne of Deity. Upon all
things, from the least to the greatest, the Creator's name is written, and in all
are the riches of His power displayed.
   "And the years of eternity, as they roll, will bring richer and still more
glorious revelations of God and of Christ. As knowledge is progressive, so will
love, reverence, and happiness increase."—The Great Controversy, pages
677, 678.

THE "OVERFLOW" OFFERING—September 30. This quarter is unique in that it has
fourteen Sabbaths. But the overflow offering, regularly taken on the thirteenth Sab-
bath of normal quarters, will be taken on the last Sabbath of the quarter, which is
September 30. The fourth quarter has thirteen Sabbaths and not twelve as usually
happens when preceded by a fourteen Sabbath quarter. In other words, 1944 has
fifty-three Sabbaths instead of the normal fifty-two. The overflow offering is to be
devoted to the mission fields of the Southern European Division. The last overflow
offering to Southern Europe amounted to $8,118.75, and was used to erect modest
church buildings in Portuguese Guinea in Africa, the Azores, Madeira, Cape Verde,
and St. Thomas Islands. For the past two years the overflow offerings have far
exceeded what was given in 1940, so we confidently expect a generous gift on
September 30.
