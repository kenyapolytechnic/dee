          How to Study These Lessons
    The purpose of the lessons for this quarter is to present
the person of Jesus Christ as the object of faith. The more
fully we know Him as the Wonderful One that He is, the
more intelligent will be our faith in Him, and the more shall
we prize that personal fellowship with Him which is the very
essence of Christian experience.
    We venture to offer suggestions concerning the method to
be followed in studying these lessons. First read the synopsis
of the lesson, looking up each Scripture reference and ob-
serving the particular thought in the text which is to be em-
phasized. Go over the synopsis a second time, reciting from
memory as many of the texts as possible. Repeat this process
until the texts have been mastered. Then read the notes,
connecting each one with the phase of the lesson which it is
designed to develop further. Having thus" obtained a general
grasp of the lesson, ask each question, and try to answer it
in the exact words of the text appended to it, without re-
ferring again to the synopsis. Look up the text in the Bible,
if necessary, but do not turn to the synopsis unless you are
unable to recall the special teaching for which the text is
used. In this way, there will be some real study of the Bible,
and not merely a superficial dealing with the synopsis, which
is prepared simply as a guide to the thought of the Scriptures.
Do not be discouraged if the results are not fully satisfactory
at first. Earnest effort will be richly repaid.
    Through experience alone can the truths of the Scripture
be really known. Therefore every lesson should be appro-
priated as a part of the life. "We have believed and know."
The Holy Spirit is the only efficient teacher of divine truth,
and His aid should be constantly sought. "If any man will
do His will, he shall know of the doctrine." Walk in the
light, and the light will grow brighter.

   There were 3,670 Sabbath school members who studied
their lesson every day last quarter. Are you one of this
number?
   Bookmarks were given to 439 members who had been
present and on time every Sabbath and had studied their les-
son every day for a year.

                           Synopsis
    SEED THOUGHT: "Christ is all." Col. 3: 11.
    "Christ is to be exalted as the sinner's refuge."—"Gospel
Workers," page 158.
    1. The essential feature of the threefold message to be
proclaimed to all the world in this generation is "the ever-
lasting gospel." Rev. 14: 6. This is called "the gospel of
God" (Rom. 1: 1), "the gospel of the grace of God" (Acts
20: 24), "the gospel of Christ" (Gal. 1: 7), "the gospel of the
glory of the blessed God" (1 Tim. 1: 11, A. R. V.), "the -gospel
of the glory of Christ" (2 Cor. 4: 4, A. R. V.), "this gospel of
the kingdom" (Matt. 24: 14), and "the gospel of your sal-
vation" (Eph. 1: 13).
    2. But all these phases of the gospel are included in the
one statement that it is "the gospel of God, . . . concerning
His Son." Rom. 1: 1, 3. This best of all "good news" is
found in the wondrous fact that "the Father sent the Son to
be the Saviour of the world." 1 John 4: 14. All gifts are in-
cluded in the gift of the Son of God. Rom. 8: 32. All
blessings are found in Him. Eph. 1: 3. In Him, eternal life
is bestowed. 1 John 5: 11, 12.
    3. The gospel is the unveiling of God's righteousness
 (Rom. 1: 16, 17), not in a series of theological definitions
and propositions, but in the person of "a righteous Branch,"
who is.our righteousness (Jer. 23: 5, 6). Only the Son of God
could make this revelation. John 1: 18. He is manifested
as "the mystery of godliness." 1 Tim. 3: 16. His life is our
ransom (Matt. 20: 28), and therefore in Him "we have our
redemption" (Eph. 1: 7, A. R. V.).
    4. Salvation is assured by looking to a person. Isa. 45: 22.•
Faith for salvation centers in a person. Acts 16: 30, 31. •
Salvation is found only in the Person, Christ. Acts 4: 12. •
He is an all-sufficient Saviour. Heb. 7: 25. God's voice is
speaking to us, as on the mount of transfiguration, "This is
My beloved Son: hear Him." Mark 9: 7.
4          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
   5. The gospel which Paul preached was the good news of
a crucified and risen Christ. 1 Cor. 15: 1-4. Concerning Him
he preached (1 Cor. 1: 23), and he did not feel the need of
any other theme (1 Cor. 2: 2). Any other gospel than the
one which Paul preached is simply a perversion of the gospel
of Christ. Gal. 1: 6-8. Through Christ heaven and earth
have been again united (Gen. 28: 12 with John 1: 51), and
through Him we have access to God (Eph. 2:. 18).

                           Questions
    1. What is the essential feature of the threefold message?
Rev. 14: 6.
    2. What different expressions are used in the Scriptures
in speaking of the gospel? See synopsis, paragraph 1.
    3. What one statement covers the whole ground? Rom.
1: 1, 3.
    4. What "good news" is more important than any other?
1 John 4: 14.
    5. How much is included in the gift of the Son of God?
Rom. 8:32.
    6. What blessings are bestowed in Christ? Eph. 1: 3.
    7. What do we have when we have the Son of God?
1 John 5: 11, 12.
    8. What is the gospel? Rom. 1: 16, 17.
    9. In whom is God's righteousness unveiled to us? Jer.
23: 5, 6.
  10. Who only can make this revelation? John 1: 18.
  11. What is the Son of God declared to be? Col. 2: 2,
A. R. V.
  12. Who is "the mystery of godliness"? 1 Tim. 3: 16.
  13. For what purpose did Christ give His life? Matt.
20: 28.
  14. What do we therefore have in Him? Eph. 1: 7.
  15. How is salvation assured? Isa. 45: 22.
  16. In whom does faith for salvation center? ' Acts
16: 30, 31.
  17. In whom only can salvation be found? Acts 4: 12.
  18. What is Christ able to do? Heb. 7: 25.
  19. What is the divine command to us? Mark 9: 7.

with John 1: 51. '
  25. Through whom do we have access to God? Eph. 2: 18.

                                   • Notes
            PEE REVELATION OF A PERSON IN THE OLD TESTAMENT
    1. The first verse of the Bible introduces us to a person; and through-
 out the Book, that person is revealed to us. Note how He stands out in
 the books of the Old Testament:
     The Seed: Gen. 3:15. Shiloh: Gen. 49:10. The I AM: Ex. 3:14. The
 Lamb: Lev. 4:32. The Star out of Jacob: Num. 24:17. The Prophet: Deut.
18:15. The Captain of the Lord's host: Joshua 5:14. The Angel of the
 Lord: Judges 13:18. The Lord of hosts: 1 Sam. 1:3. The Seed of David:
2 Sam. 7:12. The Priest: Ps. 110:4. Wisdom: Prov. 8:12, 22. The "Prince
 of the four names": Isa. 9:6, 7. The Servant of the Lord : Isa. 42:1. The
 Lord our righteousness: Jer. 23:5, 6. He whose right it is to reign: Ezek.
•21:27. The Son of man: Dari. 7:13. The Messiah : Dan. 9:25. My Son:
 Hosea 11:1. A Ruler in Israel: Micah 5:2. The Man : Zech. 6;12. Thy
 King: Zech. 9 :9. The Messenger of the covenant: Mal. 3:1. The word
 "Jehovah" (represented in the Authorized Version by 'Loan") occurs about
7,000 times.
                      A PERSON IN THE NEW TESTAMENT
    2. We meet with Jesus in the first verse of the New Testament, and
 we do not take our leave of Him until we come to the last verse. His
 person is the theme of every book.
    "The Christian revelation is not a mere message about God, it is h,
 unveiling of God."
    "The person of Christ is the explanation of Christianity."
                THE DISTINGUISHING FEATURE OF CHRISTIANITY.
     3. "Christianity is the only religion in the world which rests on the
 person of its founder. A man can be a faithful Mohammedan without
 in the least concerning himself with the person of Mohammed. So also a
 man can be a true and faithful Buddhist without knowing anything what-
 ever about Buddha. It is quite different with Christianity. Christianity
 is so inextricably bound up with Christ that our view of the person of
 Christ involves and determines our view of Christianity."
                              THE ESSENTIAL TRUTHS
    4. "Christ crucified, Christ risen, Christ ascended into the heavens, Christ
 coming again, should so soften, gladden, and fill the mind of the minister
 that he will present these truths to the people in love and deep earnestness."
 -"Gospel Workers," page 159.
                      CHRIST THE CENTER OF ATTRACTION
     5. "Of all professing Christians, Seventh-day Adventists should be fore-
  most in uplifting Christ before the world. The proclamation of the third
  angel's message calls for the presentation of the Sabbath truth. This truth,
  with others included in the message, is to be proclaimed ; but the great cen-
  ter of attraction, Christ Jesus, must not be left out. It is at the cross of
• Christ that mercy and truth meet together, and righteousness and peace kiss
  each other. The sinner must be led to look to Calvary; with the simple
  faith of a little child he must trust in the merits of the Saviour, accepting
  His righteousness, believing in His mercy."- Id., pages 156, 157.
                          •    THE STORY OF CHRIST
    6. "Teach the simple lessons given by Christ. Tell the story of His life
 of self-denial and sacrifice, His humiliation and death, His resurrection and
 ascension, His intercession for sinners in the courts above."- Id., page 154.
     "Present the truth as it is in Jesus."- lb.
                    NOTHING NEEDED TO SUPPLEMENT CHRIST
    7. "Lift up Jesus, you 'that teach the people, lift Him up in sermon, in
 song, in prayer. Let all your powers be directed to pointing souls, confused,
 bewildered, lost, to 'the Lamb of God.' Lift Him up, the risen Saviour, and
 say to all who hear, Come to Him who `hath loved us, and bath given Him-
6             SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
self for us.' Let the science of salvation be the burden of every sermon, the
theme of every song. Let it be poured forth in every supplication. Bring
nothing into your preaching to supplement Christ, the wisdom and power
of God."— Id., page 160.
    "The people must be instructed that Christ is unto them salvation and
righteousness."— Id., page 162.


          Lesson 2 — Christ in All the Bible
                           JANUARY 8, 1921

                    Synopsis
    SEED THOUGHT: "The whole Bible is a manifestation of
Christ."—"Gospel Workers," page 250.
    1. The Bible is not primarily a book of history, although
there is much history in it; it is not primarily a book of biog-
raphy, although it contains many biographical incidents; it
is not primarily a book of science, although it deals with many
scientific facts; it. is not primarily a treatise on systematic
theology, although it is the only authoritative source of our
knowledge of God. What then is the Bible? It is God's mes-
sage to man, telling of His purpose and .plan to restore man
and the earth through the person and work of His Son, Jesus
Christ our Lord. In our reading and study of the Scriptures,
we must have this in mind; and through the aid of the Holy
Spirit, we must seek to see throughout the Scriptures a pro-
gressive.,;development of God's "eternal purpose which He
purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord."
    2. The men who wrote the Bible were "moved by the Holy
Spirit" (2 Peter 1: 21, A. R. V.), and we shall therefore find
in the Bible the testimony of the Holy Spirit to its real con-
tents.
    3. That the purpose of the Scriptures is to testify of Christ'
and His word (John 5: 39), becomes more and more clear to
him who reads under the guidance of the Holy Spirit (John
16: 14). Christ is Himself the Word of God (Rev. 19: 13) ;
and whatever the written Word is, it is that because of its
relation to Christ. The Word is living (Heb. 4: 12), because
Christ is life (John 1: 4). The Word is a lamp and a light
 (Ps. 119: 105), because Christ is the light of the world (John
8: 12). The same God who spoke through the prophets has
spoken through His Son (Heb. 1: 1, 2) ; and the same creative
power is in the spoken Word (Ps. 33: 6), as in Christ, the in-
carnate Word (John 1: 1-3).
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     7
     4. Moses knew Christ (Heb. 11: 26) and wrote of Him
 (John 5: 46), as did also the prophets (John 1:45), all of
whom bore witness to Him (Acts 10: 43). In all three of the
great divisions of the Old Testament — the law, the prophets,
and the Psalms-- are found things written concerning Christ
and His work. Luke 24: 44. By these statements, we are
to understand not merely that there are in the Old Testament
certain passages which speak of Christ, as is evident even to
a superficial reader, but that the revelation of Christ and His
work constitutes the very warp and woof of those Scriptures.
There are individual types of Christ, as Adam, the head of the
human family. Rom. 5: 14. There are ceremonial observances
which are types of Christ, as the Passover. 1 Cor. 5: 7. There
are experiences which teach of Christ, as drinking water from
 the rock in the wilderness. 1 Cor. 10: 4. There are experi-
ences which are in the nature of warnings to us concerning
our relation to Christ, as the failures of the children of Israel.
1 Cor. 10: 6-11. When interpreted in the light of the New
Testament, it will be found that the Old Testament is full of
this kind of teaching about .Christ, from Genesis to Malachi.
     5. From the first verse of the New Testament (Matt. 1: 1)
 to the last (Rev. 22: 21), one Person dominates the whole
record. The Gospels furnish His biography in exact fulfill-
ment of the prophetic writings. In the Gospels, we behold the
 King of Zech. 9:9; the Servant of Isa. 42: 1; the Man
 of Zech. 6: 12; and we behold Him as GOd, according to
 Isa. 40: 9. In the Acts, He continues to do and to teach (Acts
1: 1) through the Holy Spirit what He began to do and to
 teach while He was here in the flesh; in the epistles, special
 emphasis is given to the interpretation, and the application in
 personal experience, of the full meaning of Christ and His
 work; and the whole revelation is brought to a climax in the
 last book of the Bible, where He comes as "King of kings, and
 Lord of lords" (Rev. 19:16).
     6. Throughout the Scriptures, we hear the gracious invi-
 tation, "Come" (Gen. 7:1; Rev. 22:17) and the Person to
 whom we are to come is both the Revealer and the Subject of
 the revelation (Matt. 11: 27, 28).
                            Questions
   1. By whom were the men who wrote the Bible moved?
2 Peter 1:21.
   2. Of whom do the Scriptures of the Old Testament testify?
John 5:39.
   3. What aid does the Spirit of truth render in perceiving
this testimony to Christ? John 16: 14.
   4. What title is given to Christ which directly connects
Him with the Scriptures? Rev. 19: 13.
    5. Why is the Word a living Word? Heb. 4: 12; John 1: 4.
8             SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
    6. Why is the Word a light? Ps. 119: 105; John 8: 12.
    7. Through what two personal agencies has God spoken?
Heb. 1: 1, 2.
    8. What is said both of the spoken Word, and of Christ,
the incarnate Word? Ps. 33: 6; John 1: 1-3.
    9. What shows that Moses knew Christ? Heb. 11: 26.
   10. Who is the theme of the writings of Moses? John 5: 46.
   11. Who is the theme of the writings of the prophets?
John 1:45.
   12. To whom did all the prophets bear witness? Acts 10: 43.
   13. Who is the theme in all three of the main divisions of
the Old Testament? Luke 24: 44.
   14. Who is definitely declared to be a type of Christ?
Rom. 5: 14.
   15. In whom did the Passover find its fulfillment? 1 Cor.
5: 7.
   16. Who was represented by the rock in the wilderness?
1 Cor. 10: 4.
   17. Why are the experiences of the children of Israel
recorded? 1 Cor. 10: 6-11.
   18. What is indicated by the first and the last verses of
the New Testament? Matt. 1: 1; Rev. 22: 21.
   19. What views of Christ are emphasized in the Gospels?
Zech. 9:9; Isa. 42:1; Zech. 6:12; Isa. 40:9.
   20. What phase of Christ's work is presented in the Acts?
See synopsis, paragraph 5.
 - 21. On what is the emphasis placed in the epistles? Same
paragraph.
   22. What final view of Christ is given in the Revelation?
Rev. 19: 16.
   23. What invitation is extended throughout the Scriptures?
Gen. 7: 1; Rev. 22: 17.
   24. To whom are we thus invited to come? Matt. 11: 27, 28.
                                  Notes
                                "JESUS ONLY"
   1. When we read the Scriptures, the experiences of many individuals and
the record of many events are presented to us; but when we have finished,
we, like the disciples on the mount of transfiguration, should see "Jesus
only." We should " 'search the Scriptures' for a vision of the Lord Jesus
Christ."
                              SEEING HIS FACE
   2. That famous document, the Emancipation Proclamation, issued by
President Lincoln, has been written in such a way that when the large sheet
on which it is inscribed is held near the eye, the words forming the docu-
ment can be easily read, but when it is held at a little distance, these same
words form so distinctly the face of the author, Mr. Lincoln, that it is at
once recognized. So it is with the'Scriptures. If our eyes are enlightened
by the Holy Spirit, we shall see on every page the face of Jesus.
                              THE ONLY NAME
  3. The name Jesus occurs nearly a thousand times in the New Testa-
ment, and the name Christ over five hundred times.
              SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                               9
                         "THAT I MAY KNOW HIM"
   4. Inasmuch as the Bible has been written to reveal Christ and His work
for us, the purpose of our study of the Bible should be to find the Christ
there - revealed, so that He may become to us a personal Saviour. Do not
be satisfied with reading the texts about Christ, but through these texts, be-
come acquainted with.Him.
                           CHANGED BY BEHOLDING
    6. "As the student of the Bible beholds.the Redeemer, there is awakened
in the soul the mysterious power of faith, adoration, and love. Upon the
vision of Christ the gaze is fixed, and the beholder grows into the likeness
of that which he adores."—"Educdion," page 192
                        REDEMPTION ,THROUGH CHRIST
    6. "The central theme of the Bible, the theme about which every other
in the whole book clusters, is the redemption plan, the restoration in the
human soul of the image of God. From the first intimation of hope in the
sentence pronounced in Eden to that last glorious promise of the Revelation,
'They shall see His face ; and His name shall be in their foreheads,' the
burden of every book and every passage of the Bible is the'UnfOlding of this
wondrous theme, — man's uplifting, — the power of God, 'which giveth us
the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ."— Id., pages 125, 126.

                           Synopsis
    SEED THOUGHT:      "From the days of eternity the Lord
Jesus Christ was one with, the Father."—"The Desire of
Ages," page 19.
   1. It is plainly revealed to us in the Scriptures that Jesus
of Nazareth was the manifestation in the flesh of one who
had existed from eternity. Through the incarnation He who
had been "in the form of God," took "the form of a servant."
Phil. 2: 5-7. When the Son of God was manifested (1 John
3: 8), the eternal life formerly with the Father was mani-
fested (1 John 1:2).
   2. In experiencing this change, He who was formerly rich
became poor (2 Cor. 8: 9), leaving the glory which was His
with the Father "before the world was" (John 17: 5). Jesus
spoke of Himself as coming "from the Father" (John 16: 28),
and of Hi§ returning "where He was before" (John 6: 62).
   3. When Jesus faced death, He did so as one who knew
that He came "from God," and that He was to go back "to
God." John 13: 3. The world to which He came "was made
by Him." John I: 10.

                        CHRIST CLAIMED PRE-EXISTENCE
    I. "Nothing is more plain than that over and over again, in all sorts of
ways, by implication and by, direct statement, to all sorts of audiences,
friends and foes, He reiterated this tremendous claim to have dwelt in the
bosom of the Father, long -before He lay on the breast of Mary."—"The
Holy of Holies," page 350.

saying, 'I AM THAT I AM.' "—"The Desire of Ages," page 24.
    "He who was the foundation of the ritual and economy of Israel, would
be looked upon as its enemy and destroyer."— Id., page M. '
    "He had dwelt in eternal light, as one with God, but His life on earth
must be spent in solitude."—Ibid.

and had daily fed them with the ,bread from heaven."—Id., page 386.
    "Since the first gospel sermon was preached, 'when in Eden it was de-
clared that the seed of the woman should bruise the serpent's head, Christ
had been uplifted as the way, the truth, and the life. He was the way
when Adam lived, when Abel presented to God the blood of the slain lamb,
representing the blood of the Redeemer. Christ was the way by which pa-
triarchs and prophets were saved. . .. Christ had not ceased to be God when
He became man. Though He had humbled Himself to humanity, the God-
head was Still His own."—Id., pages 663, 664.

    SEED THOUGHT:     "His divinity was veiled with humanity,—
the invisible glory in the visible human form."—"The Desire
of Ages," page 23.
   .1. In the first promise of the., gospel, it was revealed that
One born of a woman would break Satan's hold upon the
human family. Gen. 3: 15. The tabernacle and the temple,
12          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

 in which the glory of the Lord was visibly manifested (Ex.
40: 34; 1 Kings 8: 11), foreshadowed the coming of Him
 who would tabernacle in the flesh and in whom the same
 glory would be seen (John 1: 14, A. R. V., margin).
    2. The promise of the land (afterward interpreted to in-
clude the whole world, Rom. 4:.13) was made to the seed of
Abraham (Gen. 12: 7), and the promise of the throne which
would endure forever was made to the seed of David (2 Sam.
7: 12, 13). The fulfillment of these promises required the
incarnation of Christ (Gal. 3: 16), who was descendant of
both David and Abraham (Matt. 1: 1).
    3. The ancient typical service of the sanctuary was a
 prophecy of Christ (Col. 2: 16, 17; Heb. 10: 1), who is the
true priest (Heb. 4: 14), and the true sacrifice (Heb. 7: 27;
Eph. 5: 2).
    4. All the prophets foretold the advent of Christ (Acts
3: 24), beginning even with Moses (Luke 24: 27). Isaiah
testified to the fact of Christ's birth (Isa. 9: 6, 7) ; Daniel
foretold the time (Dan. 9: 25) ; Micah indicated the place
 (Micah 5: 2) ; Isaiah described His work (Isa. 61: 1) and His
death (Isa. 53: 7). In due time, He was "born of a woman"
 (Gal. 4: 4, A. R. V.; Matt. 2: 1), taking the same flesh and
blood that we have (Heb. 2: 14), even sinful flesh (Rom. 8: 3),
and becoming in all things like us (Heb. 2: 17). He thus
exchanged the form of God for the form of a servant. Phil.
2: 5-7.
    5. So fully was Jesus identified with our common hu-
manity, that He was hungry (Matt. 4: 2) ; He became weary
 (John 4: 5, 6) ; He required food and drink (John 4: 7, 8)
and sleep (Matt. 8: 23, 24) ; and He sympathized with the
sorrowing (John 11: 35).
    6. After His resurrection, Christ still retained His hu-
manity, eating and drinking with His disciples (Acts 10: 40,
41), and giving full proof of His material form (Luke 24: 39;
John 20: 20, 27). Although He is now at the right hand of
God (Mark 16: 19), He is man (1 Tim. 2: 5), and still an-
nounces Himself by His earthly name as a descendant of
David (Rev. 22: 16).
                           Questions
    1. What was revealed in the first gospel promise? Gen.
3: 15.
    2. What was visibly manifested in the tabernacle and the
temple? Ex. 40: 34; 1 Kings 8: 11.
    3. What was thus foreshadowed? John 1: 14.
    4. To whom was the land first promised? Gen. 12:.7.
    5. How was this promise afterward interpreted? Rom.
4: 13.
    6. To whom was the throne of the world promised? 2
Sam. 7: 12, 13.

Daniel? Dan. 9: 25.
   15. What specification was contributed by Micah? Micah
5:2.                              -
   16. How was His work foretold? Isa. 61: 1. His death?
Isa. 53:7.
   17. When the time foretold by the prophets had arrived,
what happened? Gal. 4: 4, A. R. V.; Matt. 2: 1.
   18. What kind of flesh and blood did Jesus have? Heb.
2: 14; Rom. 8: 3.

after His resurrection? Acts 10: 40, 41.
   23. What proof did He furnish to them that He was the
same Jesus who had been crucified? Luke 24: 39; John
20: 20, 27.
   24. Where is Jesus now? Mark 16: 19.
   25. What nature does He still retain? 1 Tim. 2: 5.

humanity? Rev. 22: 16.
                               Notes
   I. "Nearly two thousand years ago, a voice of mysterious import was
heard in heaven, from the throne of God, 'Lo, I come.' Sacrifice and offer-
ing Thou wouldst not, but a body hast Thou prepared. . . Lo, I come (in
the volume of the book it is written of Me,) to do Thy will, 0 God.' In these
words is announced the fulfillment of the purpose that had been hidden from
eternal ages. Christ was about to visit our world, and to become incarnate."
-"The Desire of Ages," page 23.
   2. "God commanded Moses for Israel, 'Let them make Me a sanctuary,
that I may dwell among them,' and He abode in the sanctuary, in the midst
of His people. Through all their weary wandering in the desert, the symbol
of His presence was with them. So Christ set up His tabernacle in the
midst of our human encampment. He pitched His tent by the side of the
tents of men, that He might dwell among us. and make us familiar with
His divine character and life."-"The Desire of Ages," page 23.
14     -      SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
   "In Christ the family of earth and the family of heaven ,are bound to-
gether. Christ glorified is our brother. Heaven is enshrined in humanity,
and humanity is enfolded in the bosom of infinite love."— Id., pages 25, 26.
                           A WONDERFUL UNION '
   3. "God was manifest in the flesh: in Christ we behold the union of
the Godhead with humanity — the divinity not destroying the humanity, the
humanity remaining in its integrity in order that the divinity might be
revealed by it. They that cannot see in Christ the finite as well as the in-
finite, cannot rightly see the glory. of God shining in the face of Jesus
Christ."—"Deeper Spiritual Life," page 161.
                      GOD MADE KNOWN IN CHRIST                        ;
   4. "The God who dwells in thick darkness, remote from sense and above.
thought, has come forth and made Himself known to man, even in a very
real way has come within the reach of man's senses, in the manhood of
Jesus Christ."—"The Expositor's Bible" (Colossians), page 72.          .
                           A SURE GROUND OF FAITH
    5. "Henceforth it was to be no visionary ladder, swept away by the
dawn, which was to lead up to heaven, but that in Jesus God Himself is
permanently made over to us ; that He, in His one, visible person, unites
heaven and earth, God and man ; that there is an ever living union between
the highest height of heaven and the lowest depth of earth. Profound and
wide as the humanity of Christ, to the most forgotten and remote outcast, •
to the most sunken and despairing of men, do God's love and care and help-
fulness now come; high and glorious as the divinity of Christ may the hopes
of all men now rise. He who understands the incarnation     9 of the Son of
God has a surer ground of faith, and a richer hope and a straighter access
to heaven, than if the ladder of Jacob stood at his bed-head and God's angels
were ministering to him."—"The Gospel of St. John," page 66.

                           Synopsis
     SEED THOUGHT: " 'God    with us' is the surety of our de-
liverance from sin, the assurance of our power to obey the law
of heaven."—"The Desire of Ages," page 25.
    1. To a world confused, bewildered, lost, the Son of God
came in our flesh that He might reveal the Father in His true
character, making known His name in human relations.
Ex. 34: 6, 7; John 17: 6, 26. Jesus in the flesh was both the
revealer and the revelation in His own person (John 1: 18;
Col. 1: 15), and He is the only channel for this revelation
 (Matt. 11: 27).
    2. As the representative of the human family, Jesus ac-
cepted the burden of its iniquity (Isa. 53: 6, 11), and "bare
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   45
 our sins in His own body on the tree" -(1 Peter 2: 24). For
 this purpose was He manifested (1 John 3: 5), for this pur-
 pose was He offered (Heb. 9: 28), thus being the Lamb of
 God (John 1:29).
      3. Jesus suffered in the flesh "that He might bring'us to
 God" (1 Peter 3: 18), becoming in Himself the means of union
 between heaven and earth (Gen. 28: 12; John 1:51). In
 thii way God visited our world (Matt. 1:•23), that He might
 reconcile us to Himself (2 Cor. 5: 19).
      4t By taking:our flesh and dying on the cross, Jesus, made
 provision for -the overthrow of the devil (Heb.• 2: 14) and
 the destruction of his works (1 John 3: 8)'. At the-cross, the
 prince of this world was "cast out." . John 12: 31. Christ's
 victory furnishes • us with a sound Easis for courage in our
 conflict with the world. John 16: 33. , .       ,
       5. Through sin, life was forfeited (Rom. 6: 23) ; but
 Jesus came that we might have life (John 10: 10).. With
 this life comes the assurance of deliverance from sin, and
 the power for obedience to all -God's requirements. Rom.
8: 2-4. By this means, we realize the experience of being
 "dead unto sin, but alive unto God in Christ Jesus." Rom.
  6: 11, A. R. V.
                              Questions
       1. By taking our flesh, what did Jesus reveal to the world?
  Ex. 34: 6, 7; John 17: 6, 26.
   - 2. What was Jesus in His own person? . John 1: 18;
  Col. 1:15.
       3. By what means only can God be revealed to us?

        8. Viewed from this standpoint, what was He? John 1: 29.
        9. For *what purpose did Jesus suffer in the flesh? 1
  Peter 3: 18.
     10. What union was effected in Him? Gen. 28 : 12;
  John 1: 51.
     11. Who visited our world in the person of Jesus?

                         Notes
                    THE PURPOSE OF CHRIST'S HUMILIATION
   1. "In stooping to take upon Himself humanity, Christ revealed a hhar-
acter the opposite of the character of Satan. But He stepped still lower in
the path of humiliation. 'Being found in fashion as a man, He humbled
Himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.' As
the high priest laid aside his gorgeous pontifical robes, and officiated in the
white linen dress of the common priest, so Christ took the form of a serv-
ant, and offered sacrifice, Himself the priest, Himself the victim. .. . Christ
was treated as we deserve, that we might be treated as He deserves. He
was condemned for our sins, in which He had no share, that we might be
justified by His righteousness, in which we had no share. He suffered the
death which was ours, that we might receive the life which was His."—
"The Desire of Ages," page 25. '
                     •   TO SAVE THE HUMAN RACE
   2. "His birth was the entrance of the eternal Son into human life in
order to save from destruction the human race."—"Through Christ to God,"
page 274.
               •              THE RISK INVOLVED
    3. "Christ assumed, not the original unfallpn, but our fallen humanity.
In this second experiment, He stood not precisely where Adam before Him
had, but, as has already been said, with immense odds against Him — evil,
with all the prestige of victory and its consequent enthronement in the very
constitution of our nature, armed with more terrific power against the pos-
sible realization of this divine idea of man — perfect holiness. All this con-
sidered, the disadvantages of the situation, the tremendous risks involved,
and the fierceriess of the opposition encountered, we come to some adequate
sense both of the reality and greatness of that vast Moral achievement';.
human nature tempted, tried, miscarried in Adam, lifted up in Christ to the
sphere of actualized sinlessness."—"The I Ants of Christ," pages 248, 249.
                     OUR BASIS OF CONFIDENCE AND HOPE
                                                                       •
    4. "He was God manifest in the flesh, and came to this earth 'that He
might bring us to God.' It is this that makes Christ central Old dominant
in every life that receives Him, winning trust, redeeming froM sin, eliciting
devotion, and inspiring hope. It is because He is God manifest, God enter-
ing into human life, God meeting human need."--"Christianity Is Christ,"
page 10.7.
                   THE FULL MEANING OF THE INCARNATION
    5. "'He was manifested'— and . . let us not read into the 'He' any-
thing small or narrow. If we do, we shall at once be driven into the place
of •having to deny the declaration that He can take away sins. If He was
man as I am man merely, then though He be perfect and sinless, He cannot
take away sins. If into the 'He' we will read all that John evidently meant
according to the testimony of his own writing, we shall begin to see some-
thing of the stupendous idea, and something of the possibility at least of
believing the declaration that 'He was manifested to take away sins.' Con-
sider the manifestation and sins, as to man. The terms of the final promise
of the incarnation were, 'Thou shalt call His name Jesus ; for it is He that
shall save His people from their sins.' When the songs to which the shep-
             SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                         17
herds listened were heaid, what said they? 'There is born to you this
day . . . a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord.' The promise of the incarna-
tion was that of the coming of One to lift sins."-"The Fundamentals,"
volume 1, page 89.

   1. Everywhere the New Testament sets forth Jesus of
Nazareth as the Son of God. The announcement of His birth
declared the fact. Luke 1: 35. John the Baptist, who was
sent to prepare the way before Him, bore testimony to the
same effect. John 1: 34. One of His earliest disciples was
convinced of it. John 1: 49. So were His other disciples on
a later occasion. Matt. 14: 33. Martha confessed her belief
in Him as the Son of God. John 11: 27. The wonderful works
of Jesus recorded in the Gospel of John were written to
convince us of His divine sonship. John 20: 30, 31.
    2. To the man whom He had healed of blindness, Jesus
revealed Himself as the Son of God. John 9: 35-37. To the
Jews, Jesus claimed His oneness with the Father as His
Son (John 10: 30, 36), to whom the same honor was due as
to the Father (John 5: 23). Satan acknowledged His claim
to be the Son of God. Matt. 4: 3, 6. This claim was mock-
ingly repeated by the chief priests as He hung upon the cross.
Matt. 27: 43. At the crucifixion, a Roman centurion was led
to acknowledge that He was the Son of God. Matt. 27: 54.
His resurrection proved the fact. Rom. 1: 4.
    3. When Peter confessed his faith in Christ as the Son
of God, Christ pronounced a blessing upon him as having re-
ceived a divine revelation. Matt. 16: 17. Jesus Himself
tacitly accepted the testimony of Nathanael that He was the
Son of God. John 1: 49. 50. The accusation made before
Pilate was that "He made Himself the Son of God." John 19 : 7.
    4. Paul, after his conversion, declared that Jesus was the
 Son of God (Acts 9: 20), and so he continued to preach (2
 Cor. 1: 19). By a voice from heaven, God Himself bore testi-
 18           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
 mony to the same fact. 2 Peter 1: 16, 17. Our High Priest
 in the heavenly sanctuary is still declared to be "Jesus the
 Son of God." Heb. 4: 14.
     5. God sent His Son into the world to be its Saviour
 (John 3: 17), and the future of every man depends upon his
 attitude toward this Son of God (John 3: 18).

                              Notes
   1. Adam was a son of God by creation (Luke 3:38), being made in the
image of God (Gen. 1:26). He was in fellowship with the life of the
Creator. Through sin, he became "alienated from the life of God" (Eph.
              SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                            19
4:18), and lost his place as a son of God. Only one who stood in the rela-
tion of divine Son could restore man to his place as a son (Gal. 4:4, 5),
and bestow upon him the privilege of being once more in the true sense a
child of God. Our hope of salvation from sin, and restoration to permanent
fellowship with God, finds a sure foundation in the fact that God sent His.
only-begotten Son to be our Saviour.
                       THE EXCELLENCY OF HIS NAME
    2. "Christ is Son of God, not in the sense in which angels, as a class of
beings, are designated by this name, but as He who has taken His seat on
the right hand of the Majesty on high. The greatness of His position is
proportionate to the excellency of the name of Son. This name He has not
obtained by favor nor attained by effort, but inherited by indefeasible
right. . . . He is Son. Which of the angels was ever so addressed? To
speak of the angels as sons and yet say that not one of them individually
is a son may be self-contradictory in words, but the thought is consistent
and true. . .
    "They are the Son's ministers. Like swift winds, they convey THis mes-
sages ; or they carry destruction at His bidding, like a flame of fire. But
the Son is enthroned God forever. The scepter of righteousness, by whom-
soever borne, is the scepter of His kingdom; all thrones and powers, human
and angelic, hold sway under Him."—"The Expositor's Bible" (Hebrews),
pages 25-27.
                    A COMPLETE REVELATION IN THE SON
   3. "All that man needs to know or can know of God has been re-
vealed in the life and character of His Son. 'No man hath seen God at any
time ; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He bath
declared Him.' Taking humanity upon Him, Christ came to be one with
humanity, and at the same time to reveal our heavenly Father to sinful
human beings. He was in all things made like unto His brethren. He be-
came flesh, even as we are. He was hungry and thirsty and weary. He
was sustained by food and refreshed by sleep. He shared the lot of men,
and yet He was the blameless Son of God. He was a stranger and sojourner
on the earth,— in the world, but nob of the world ; tempted and tried as
men and women to-day are tempted and tried, yet living a life free from
sin."—"Testimonies for the Church," volume 8, page 286.

                           Synopsis
    SEED THOUGHT: "When He came 'in the likeness of men,'
He declared Himself the I AM."—"The Desire of Ages,"
page 24.
    1. In order that God might be known to man as his Friend
and Saviour, He revealed Himself behind the veil of humanity
by becoming flesh. John 1: 1, 14. Thus the Father came
close to man (Matt. 1: 23), in the person of Christ, who also
is God over all ' (Rom. 9: 5), and in whom dwells "all the
fullness of the Godhead" (Col. 2: 9). The Son of God, Jesus
Christ, is declared to be "the true God" (1 John 5: 20), and
the confession of Thomas should be adopted by each one of
us (John 20:28).
    2. By His declaration to the Jews (John 8: 58), Jesus
identified Himself with the I AM of the burning bush (Ex.
3: 2, 14), and consequently with the redeeming name Jehovah
 (Ex. 6: 2, 3, 6, A. R. V.). It is therefore clear that Jehovah
of the Old Testament was manifested in the Saviour Jesus.
Matt. 1: 21. In John's Gospel, whose keynote is the deity
of the Son of God, we find Jesus interpreting the I AM of the
Old Testament as being revealed in His own person. John
6: 48; 8: 12; 10; 11; 11: 25; 14: 6; 15: 1. This revelation is
continued to the very closing chapter of the Bible. Rev.
22: 13, 16.
    3. In order to be saved from sin, we must believe the
statement of Jesus, "I am He" (John 8: 24) ; but in the light
of the Old Testament, this is equivalent to the statement, "I
am God" (Isa. 43: 11, 12, A. R. V.), and we must therefore
believe in the deity of Jesus Christ (Isa. 45: 21, 22). The
Son of God and the Son of man, who has triumphed over
death, and who lives forevermore, is the only. sufficient
Saviour. Rev. 1: 17, 18.
    4. Jesus Himself asserted His deity in claiming to have
power to raise the dead (John 5: 25), and in promising to
His disciples places upon thrones when He Himself should
sit upon the throne of glory (Matt. 19: 28). He assumes
deity in describing His own experiences and work. John
2: 19-21; 10:17, 18; 6: 40.
             SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   21
   5. The Jews were convinced that Jesus claimed to be God
(John 5: 17, 18) ; and for this reason, they sought to stone
Him as a blasphemer (John 10: 31-33). In the great com-
mission to His disciples, Jesus joined Himself with the first
and the third Persons of the Godhead in such a way as to
claim His place as one of the Trinity. Matt. 28: 19.
   6. Our Saviour is "the great God" (Titus 2: 13), who
purchased us with His own blood (Acts 20: 28). The Father
Himself addresses the Son as God. Heb. 1: 8.
                            Questions

     11. How is this interpretation continued? Rev. 22: 13, 16.
     12. What teaching of Jesus must be believed, that we may

     13. What is involved in this teaching? Isa. 43: 11, 12,
  A. R. V.
    14. In what is it necessary for us to believe? Isa. 45: 21, 22.
     15. Who is the only sufficient Saviour? Rev. 1: 17, 18.
     16. In claiming what power did Jesus assert His deity?
  John 5:25.

22             SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

                                    Notes
                             GOD IN HUMAN FLESH
    1. "Christ had not ceased to be God when He became man. Though He
had humbled Himself to humanity, the Godhead was still His own. Christ
alone could represent the Father to humanity, and this representation the
disciples had been privileged to behold for over three years.
    " 'Believe Me that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me ; or else
believe Me for the very works' sake.' Their faith might safely rest on the
evidence given in Christ's works, works that no man, of himself, ever had
done, or ever could do. Christ's works testified to His divinity. Through
Him the Father had been revealed.
    "If the disciples believed this vital connection between the Father and
the Son, their faith would not forsake them when they saw Christ's suffer-
ing and death to save a perishing world. Christ was seeking to lead them
from their low condition of faith to the experience they might receive if
they truly realized what He was,— God in human flesh."—"The Desire of
Ages," pages 663, 664.
    2. "To believe in Jesus Christ is to do something more than think about
Him and have an opinion concerning Him. It means to bow before Him-in
reverence ; to take Him at His word ; to do His will ; to begin walking in
His way ; to make the great surrender ; to accept His teaching as though it
were true, and prove by practicing it. The man who so deals with Christ
is the man who in the end finds out His secret, and is able to say, 'My
Lord and my God.' "—"Aspects of Christ," page 101.
                     THE EXPLANATION OF CHRISTIANITY
    3. "The only possible explanation of Christ and Christianity is that He
was God revealed in human form. His uniqueness in relation to God makes
the Christian doctrine of the incarnation the only adequate explanation of
His personality and work. It is utterly impossible to hold to a merely hu-
man Christ. The Christ who proclaims God, who forgives sin, who unites
men to God, who is and has ever been honored and worshiped in the church,
is the only satisfying solution of the problem of how God and man may be
brought together, and man's life find its full realization and satisfaction."---.
"Christianity Is Christ," pages 109, 110.
                           THE I AM AND JEHOVAH
    4. "Note here the present / am, not I was. This anomaly in grammar
is but the utterance of the divinest Fact. It was not possible to invent a
formula of speech to express so tersely yet so clearly Christ's own sense of
His continuous existence, independent, and back of all time-conditions."--
"The I Asns of Christ," page 28.
                         THE SUPREME PROOF OF DEITY
   5. "The supreme proof to every Christian of the deity of, his Lord is then
his own inner experience of the transforming power of his Lord upon the
heart and life."—"The Fundamentals," volume 1, page 27.
                              THE TRUE SAVIOUR
   6. "A so-called Saviour, whose only power to save lies in the excellent
moral precepts that He gave, and the pure life that He lived ; who is no
longer the God-man, but the mere man ; whose blood had no sacrificial aton-
ing or propitiatory power in the moral government of Jehovah, but was
simply a martyr's witness to a superior system of ethics — is not the Sav-
iour of the four Gospels, or of Paul, or Peter, or John.. It is not under the
banners of such a Messiah that the church of God has achieved its triumphs.
The Christ of the New Testament, of the early church, of universal Chris-
tendom ; the Christ, the power of whose name has revolutionized the world
and raised it to its present level, and under whose guidance the sacramental
host of God's redeemed are advancing and shall advance to yet greater vic-
              SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                             23
tories over superstition and sin, is Immanuel, God with us, in our nature,
whose blood 'cleanseth us from all sin,' and who is 'able to save, even to the
uttermost, all that come unto God through Him.' "—"The Fundamentals,"
volume 6, page 84.

    SEED THOUGHT:     "And if children, then heirs; heirs of
God, and joint heirs with Christ." Rom. 8: 17.
   "In taking our nature, the Saviour has bound Himself to
humanity by a tie that is never to be broken."—"The Desire
of A ges,"page 25.
   1. The contrast between the preexistent Son in glory and
the Son of man on earth is very marked (Matt. 8: 20) ; but as
Son of man, He will again have the crown of glory (Rev.
14: 14). The experience of our Lord as the Son of man
between the first and last mention of Him by this title in the
New Testament, is fully described.
    2. He was both Son of man and Son of God (Matt. 16: 13,
16), by His humanity touching humanity, and by His divinity
laying hold upon the throne of God. He came from heaven
that as Son of man He might save the lost (Luke 19.: 10),
one feature of His work being to sow the world with the seed
of truth (Matt. 13: 37; John 18: 37). The Son of man showed
such sympathy for those who needed His help that His op-
posers reproached Him with being "a friend of sinners."
Matt. 9: 10; 11: 19.
    3. He pronounced blessing upon those who should suffer
"for the Son of man's sake" (Luke 6: 22), and declared that
as Son of man,He would be a sign to His generation (Luke
11: 30). As on of man, He claimed to be the Lord of the
 Sabbath (Mark 2: 28), and to have authority to forgive sins
 (Mark 2: 10-12).
    4. The fact that He was the Son of man is especially em-
phasized in the record of the closing week of His earthly life.
 As the Son of man He was betrayed (Matt. 17: 22; Luke
22: 48) and crucified (Matt. 26: 2). As the Son of man He
 was raised from the dead (Mark 9: 9, 31) and ascended
to heaven (John 6: 62). As Son of man He is in heaven
 (Acts 7: 56) watching over His church on earth (Rev. 1: 12,
24          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

13, 20), and acting as the Mediator between God and man
(1 Tim. 2: 5).
   5. As the Son of man He will come in the clouds of
heaven (Matt. 24: 30), and He will then sit upon the throne
of His glory (Matt. 25: 31), and will execute judgment (John
5: 27). As the Son of man He will receive the kingdom,
according to the prophecy (Dan. 7: 13, 14), as the represent-
ative of the saints, and in their behalf (Dan. 7: 27).
    6. Our union with Christ in His experience as the Son of
man will permit us to share with Him in the glories of His
kingdom. 2 Tim. 2: 10-12; Rom. 8: 16, 17.•
                          Questions
    1. What picture of the humiliation of the Son of God is
presented to us in the first mention of Him as the Son of
man? Matt. 8: 20.
    2. What contrast is there between this and the last men-

                               A REAL HUMANITY
     1. "His was a real and a true humanity,_one which must pass through
  the various stages of growth like any other member of the race."—"The
, Fundamentals," volume 3, page 43.
                          THE MOST EXPRESSIVE TITLE
    2. "An essential element .here is genuine humanity. Of this essential
 element of Christ's person, this one title SON OF MAN, used about eighty-
 eight times in the Gospel, is most expressive."—"The I Ants of Christ,"
 page 163.
                                A TRUE MAN
    3. "He has needs common to all ; need of food, of rest, of human sym-
 pathy and of divine assistance. He is subject to Joseph and Mary, He is
 a worshiper in the synagogue arid the temple ; He weeps over the guilty
 and hardened city, -and at the grave of a loved one; He ex-presses His de-
 pendence on God by prayer.

                             Synopsis
    SEED THOUGHT: "There is one. God, and one mediator
between God and men, the man Christ Jesus." 1 Tim. 2: 5.
    "Jesus, the only medium of communication between God
and man."—"Steps to Christ," page 23.
    1. The idea of a mediator, one through whom God reveals
Himself by word or deed, is fundamental in the Scriptures,
although the term itself is rarely used. A prophet is a spokes-
man for another, one who ministers the words of another.
Ex. 7: 1, 2; 4: 14-16. A priest "is appointed for men in things
pertaining to God" (Heb. 5: 1, A. R. V.), and becomes a
channel for the offerings of man to God and of the blessings
of God to man. A theocratic king exercises his power as
God's vicegerent (1 Chron. 29: 23) and God's minister (Rom.
13: 4). He therefore stands between God and the people at
the executor of God's will.
    2. It is under these three aspects represented in prophet,
priest, and king, that mediation is revealed to us in the
Scriptures. In ancient times, prophets spoke for God. (Heb.
1: 1), priests ministered for God in the typical service (Joel
2: 17), and kings who recognized their real position elZecuted
the will of God (Acts 13: 22). Generally ' speaking these
offices were filled by different persons, although Melchizedek
was both priest and king (Gen. 14: 18) , and David was both
prophet and king (Acts 2: 29-31; 2 Sam. 2: 4).
    3. The whole principle of mediation between God and man
finds its full expression in the person of the Son of God. Matt.
11: 27. He speaks the words of God asp His prophet. John
12: 49; 17: 8; Deut. 18: 15; John 6: 14. As priest, He min-
isters in things pertaining to God. Heb. 2: 17; 5: 5, 6; 8: 1, 2.
In Him is fulfilled the prophecy concerning the true Priest-
king. Zech. 6: 12, 13. The prophets who were before Him
could be the medium for only a partial revelation, "by divers
portions and in divers manners." Heb. 1: 1, A. R. V. In
Christ the Godhead was fully revealed. Col. 2: 9. He is
the way to God (John 14: 6) ; and through Him, we have
access to the Father (Eph. 2: 18). The typical priests were
such by'reason of their fleshly descent, but He "after the
power of an endless life." Heb. 7: 15, 16. This eternal life
He ministers to those who believe on Him. John 10: 27, 28.
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   27
The kings of Israel and Judah were more or less imperfect
foreshadowings of the King who should "reign in righteous-
ness" (Isa. 32: 1) , whose kingdom is "not of this world"
 (John 18: 36). To all eternity, He will be King. Ex. 15: 18;
Rev. 11: 15.
    4. By virtue of the union of divinity and humanity in His
own person, Christ is the Mediator between God and man
(1 Tim. 2: 5) ; and through His work, salvation is mediated
(Heb. 5: 9).

                             Notes
                  • CHRIST THE MEDIUM OF RECONCILIATION
   1. "The broken law of God demanded the life of the sinner. In all the
universe there was but one who could, in behalf of man, satisfy its claims.
Since the divine law is as sacred as God Himself, only one equal with God
could make atonement for its transgression. None but Christ could redeem
fallen man from the curse of the law, and bring him again into harmony
with heaven. Christ would take upon Himself the guilt and shame of sin,—
sin so offensive to a holy God that it must separate the Father and His Son.
Christ would reach to the depths of misery to rescue the ruined race."—
"Patriarchs and Prophets," page 68.
                          MAN'S NEED SUPPLIED IN CHRIST
    2. "The need of man, in one word, was mediation ; the work of Christ
is that' of Mediator. The life of man, as a spiritual being, is, from first
to last, a mediated life, a life mediated through the incarnate Son of God."—
"The Incarnation," page 39.
                              THE MEDIATING WORD                •
    3. "He is called the Word of God as mediating between the Father•and
all creatures ; bringing them into being, fashioning them, giving the world
its laws, imparting reason and conscience to creatures of a higher order,
and revealing to them in due season the knowledge of 'tod's will."—"The
One Mediator," page 21.
                            MEDIATION AND THE NAME
    4. "The emphasis placed on 'the name of Jesus Christ,' and on His work
,as Saviour from sin, can be satisfactorily explained only in the light of His
 mediatorial office and work as set forth in other scriptures."—"The Media-
 tion of Jesus Christ," page 95.
               HUMANITY AND DIVINITY IN CHRIST'S MEDIATION
    5. "Effective mediation between two parties, disparate as God and man,
would seem to require the intervention of one who was at once partaker
of the nature and secrets of both parties. And this was the peculiar quali-
fication of Christ Jesus, who came into the world as the representative of
the King of the ages, the incorruptible, invisible, only God (1 Tim. 1:17),
and came to save sinners (1 Tim. 1:15). To accomplish this redemptive
mediation, He must needs be 'manifest in the flesh' (1 Tim. 3:16), in order
to reveal the invisible God to men in the flesh, and to give Himself a ran-
som for all."—"The Mediation of Jesus Christ," page 134.
                      •       ' THE ETERNAL MEDIATOR
   6. "Just as we believe that a strictly mediatorial work and function be-
longs to the Son of God in His divine nature, in respect of His general
sovereign relation to the universe, in its origination and in its continuance
and administration (and this apart from the special work of redemption),
so we believe that, in the special work of redemption, His gracious interest
in and intervention for His creature man is not to be restricted, if we
would rightly understand it in its due connection and place, to the period
since His actual incarnation. Rather is that the climax of a long course
of previous visitations and dispensations of mercy."—"The. One Mediator,"
page 40.
                             A CONTINUOUS MEDIATOR
   7. "The saving mediation of Jesus Christ is now no finished work, but
a process of salvation going on in the manifold operations of the Comforter,
the Spirit of truth."—"The Mediation of 4sus Christ," pages 159, 160.

                           THE FINAL MEDIATOR
   8. "In the Old Testanient the principle [of mediation] is given in divers
Portions and in divers manners, but in the New Testament, it converges in
the doctrine of the person and work of the one final Mediator, the Son of
God. Amid all the rich diversity of the various parts of the New Testa-
ment, there is one fundamental conception common to all, that of Christ as
at once the interpreter of God to men and the door of access for men to
God."—"The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia," page 2025.

                   •        Synopsis
    SEED THOUGHT:. "I,   even I, am the Lord; and beside Me
there is no Saviour." Isa. 43: 11.
    "They [the disciples] declared Jesus to be the Saviour of
the world."—"The Desire of Ages," page 403.
    1. Before the eternal Son (4 God "became flesh, and
dwelt among us" (John 1: 14, A. R. V.), an angel told His
mother what His name should be (Matt. 1: 21), thus desig-
nating in a dear way the mission upon which He came to
this world (1 John 4: 14). His name in Greek represents
two Hebrew words which mean "Jehovah the Saviour," and
Jehovah of the Old Testh.ment was manifested in the person
of Jesus. The real meaning of the name "Jehovah" was
made known at the time of the deliverance of the children of
Israel from bondage in Egypt (Ex. 6: 3, 5, 6), and there-
after was used of God the Father in covenant relation with
His people, as their Redeemer or Saviour, always having a
more or less direct reference to the revelation of Himself in
Christ (2 Cor. 5: 19) as the Redeemer to come in the flesh.
 This is seen by comparing Isa. 40: 3 with Mark 1: 3, noting
that "Jehovah" in the former passage is applied to Jesus in
the latter. When we remember that the word "Jehovah" is
used about seven thousand times in the Old Testament, and
the name "Jesus" nearly one thousand times in the New
Testament, we shall appneciate the fact that the idea of a
Saviour permeates the whole Bible.
    2. Jehovah (manifested in Jesus) is the only Saviour
 (Isa. 43: 11), and there is none other who is a righteous God
and a Saviour (Isa. 45: 21). Peter declared that in the name
of Jesus there is salvation, and in no other name. Acts
4: 10-12. This salvation is received by fixing the faith upon
30          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
Jesus (Acts 16: 31), thus receiving Him ("John 1: 12), who
is Himself salvation (Luke 2: 27-30).
    3. The Messiah who was the subject of the Old Testa-
ment prophecy, was the Saviour of the New Testainent (Luke
2: 11):, since "Christ" means the same as "Messiah,"both
meaning anointed (John 1: 41). The crucified   ' and risen Jesus,
is now at the right hand of God as "a Prince and a Saviour."
Acts 5: 30, 31. He is able to do all that we need to have done
 (Eph. 3: 20), even to save to the uttermost (Heb. 7: 25),
and He is both able and willing to help us (Mark 1: 40, 41;
Jude 24, 25).      . •
    4. In thus exalting Christ as the Saviour, we should not
overlook the fact that God-the Father was always revealed
in and through ,Christ; and that therefore in exalting Christ,
we exalt the Father. Through' that mysterious union which
we cannot fathom or explain, -God gave Himself in the per-
son of His Son (2 Cor. 5: 19), and suffered with Him in His
humiliation and suffering. This is suggested in-the way in
which the names "Jehovah" and "God" are often joined in
the gospel of salvation. See Isa. 50: 10 and Jonah 2: 6 as
sample texts.

 and "God"?
                           ',Notes
                   • „ LORD AND. JEHOVAH
   '1. The translators of the American Revised Version .have retained the
 word "Jehovah," instead: of using the word "Lord," as in the Authorized
 Version. Wherever in the Authorized Version• the word "Lord,- spelled
 with a capital and small capitals (thus: Loan), is found, the word "Je-
 hovah" as in the original, is found in the American Revised Version.
                       THE MEANING OF THE NAME "JESUS"
      2. "The name, so precious to the children of God — JESUS — means
 'Jehovah the Saviour.' It is the Greek form of 'Joshua,' which itself is a
 contraction of 'Jehoshua,' that is, 'the help of Jehovah,' or 'the salvation
 of Jehovah,' or 'Jehovah the Saviour.' This name was given by divine
 Command (Matt. 1:21), and it is His only name, all other names being
  titles. Another has well said, 'This first syllable in His name (,le) [which
  represents Jah, the contraction for `Jehovatel tells us of His eternal God-
  head, of His covenant relations, of His mighty power, of His thoughtful
" love ; all the glories, all the virtues, but dimly seen in the Jehovah of old,
.are ours in Jesus now. It commands our reverence, it gives us lofty and
  fitting thoughts of Christ as the High and Holy One that inhabits eternity. -
  But were the name to end here, we could not look on it without awe and
  dread ; it would not be the Jesus we know. One syllable is wanting to make
  the name peerless above all others to us; Je-sus, the help or salvation of
 the'Lord.' "—"Jehovah Titles," pages 13, 14.
                        CHRIST THE POWER FOR A NEW LIFE
     3. "Our hearts are evil, and we cannot change them. 'Who can bring
  a clean thing out of an unclean? — Not one.' • 'Tile carnal mind is enmity
  against God : for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.'
  Education, culture, the exercise of the will, human effort, all have their
  proper sphere, but here they are powerless. They may produce an out-
  ward correctness of behavior, but they cannot change the heart; they can-
  not purify the springs of life. There must be a power working from
  within, a new life from above, before men can be changed from sin to
. holiness. That power is Christ. . His grace alone can quicken the lifeless
  faculties of the soul, and attract it to God, to holiness."—"Steps to Christ,"
  page 20.
                      CHRIST THE ANSWER TO THE SOUL'S CRY
      4. "It is not enough to perceive the loving-kindness of God, to see the
  benevolence, the fatherly tenderness, of His character. It is not enough to
  discern the wisdom and justice of His law, to see that it is founded upon
  the eternal principle of love. Paul the apostle saw all this when he ex-
  claimed, 'I consent unto the law that it is good.' The law is holy, and the
  commandment holy, and just, and good.' But he added, in the bitterness of
  his soul anguish and despair,, 'I am carnal, sold under sin.' He longed for
  the purity, the righteousness, to which in himself he was powerless to at-
  tain, and he cried out, '0 wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me
32            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
from this body of death?' Such is the cry that has gone up from burdened
hearts in all lands and in all ages. To all, there is but one answer, 'Behold
the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.' "— Id., pages
21, 22.
                     THE NEED OF A PERSONAL SAVIOUR
   5. "Is not the deepest religious question, after all, for each man, this:
Whether there be in Christ a present Saviour, who can cover me now with •
the robe of His righteousn,css? No historic research, no exposition of the
doctrines of an old-world Teacher, removes the burden of the friendlessness
of my sin-stained soul in a universe ruled by a holy God. If by your schol-
arship you so make to live again the classic scenes in which the Nazarene
moved and taught that I am made painfully conscious of the long centuries
that intervening divide Him from me ; then all the more, if you would se-
cure the abiding of my faith in Him, you must let me see how He can still
reach me, and stand for me."— Q.loted in "Christianity Is Christ," page 113.

                            Synopsis
    SEED THOUGHT: "They that know Thy name will put theii
trust in Thee." Ps. 9: 10.
    1. In addition to the titles of Christ already considered,
there are many others which reveal different phases of His
character and work. Some of these will be considered in
this lesson.
    2. When John the Baptist referred to Christ as the bride-
groom, and when he spoke of himself as simply "the friend
of the bridegroom" .(John 3: 27-29), he gave a definite inter-
pretation to some statements and Oriental imagery which
set forth the relation between God and His people and really
involved the coming of the Messiah. Jesus Himself accepted
this title as applying to Himself (Mark 2: 19), and thus iden-
tified Himself with the bridegroom of prophecy (Hosea
2: 19, 20). The correct interpretation of the parable of the
ten virgins involves the fact that Christ is the bridegroom.
Matt. 25: 1, 5, 6, 10. All this teaching is based upon the
conception of the family with God as the husband. Isa. 54: 5.
    3. Israel was a pastoral people, and the shepherd was a
familiar figure among them. The watchful and tender care
of the Lord for His people is therefore appealingly set forth
under this title. Ps. 23: 1-3. Jesus applied the prophecy
of Zech. 13: 7 to Himself (Matt. 26: 31), and further de-
clared that He was the good Shepherd who would die for the
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  33
sheep (John 10: 11). He thus made it clear that the 'term
"Shepherd" in the Old Testament had reference to the mani-
festation of God in His own person. Gen. 49: 24; Isa. 40: 11;
Heb. 13: 20; 1 Peter 2: 25; 5: 4.
    4. Closely related to the thought of Christ as the shep-
herd is that of Christ as the servant of the Lord. Isa. 42: 1;
Matt. 12: 15-18. He took the form of a servant (Phil. 2 : 6, 7),
and set the example of loving service (Luke 22: 27; John
13: 14-16). His followers are to serve Him (Col. 3:24) and
each other (Gal. 5: 13).
    5. In the days of Ruth, it was taught in an object lesson,
that he who would redeem an inheritance must be a near kins-
man (Ruth 4: 14), and must also be able to make the redemp-
tion (Ruth 4: 6). In the same chapters of Isaiah in which
the servant is spoken of, the revelation of the Redeemer is
emphasized. Isa. 43: 1; 44: 6; 49: 5, 6, 26. All the prophecies
concerning the Redeemer and redemption are fulfilled in
Christ (Luke 1: 68; Gal. 3: 13), who became a near kinsman
to us (Heb. 2: 14), whose blood was the price of our redemp-
tion (1 Peter 1: 18, 19), and in whom we have our redemption
 (Eph. 1: 7). Precious truths concerning Christ are thus
revealed to us under the titles of "Bridegroom," "Shepherd,"
"Servant," and "Redeemer."

                            Notes
                            JESUS THE BRIDEGROOM
   1. "John represented himself as the friend who acted as a messenger be-
tween the betrothed parties, preparing the way for the marriage. When
the bridegroom had received his bride, the mission of the friend was fulfilled.
He rejoiced in the happiness of those whose union he had promoted. So
John had been called to direct the people to Jesus, and it was his joy to
witness the success of the Saviour's work."—"The Desire of Ages," pages
179, 180.
                         CHRIST THE TRUE SHEPHERD
   2. "Now in a beautiful pastoral picture He represents His relation to
those that believe on Him. No picture was more familiar to His hearers
than this, and Christ's words linked it forever with Himself. Never could
the disciples look on the shepherds tending their flocks without recalling the
Saviour's lesson. They would see Christ in each faithful shepherd. They
would see themselves in each helpless and dependent flock.
   "This figure the prophet Isaiah had applied to the Messiah's mission, in
the comforting words, '0 Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee up into
the high mountain ; 0 Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy
voice with strength ; lift it up, be not afraid ; say unto the cities of Judah.
Behold your God. . . . He shall feed His flock like a shepherd; He shall
gather the lambs with His arm, and carry them in His bosom.' David had
sung, 'The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.' And the Holy Spirit
through Ezekiel had declared: 'I will set up one Shepherd over them, and
He shall feed them ;"I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that
which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will
strengthen that which was sick.' And I will make with them a covenant
of peace.' And they shall no more be a prey to the heathen ; . .. but they
shall dwell safely, and none shall make them afraid.'
   "Christ applied these prophecies to Himself, and He showed the contrast
between His own character and that of the leaders in Israel. The Pharisees
had just driven one from the fold [John 9 :34, 35], because he dared to bear
witness to the power of Christ. They had cut off a soul whom the true
Shepherd was drawing to Himself. In this they had shown themselves ig-
norant of the work committed to them, and unworthy of their trust as shep-
herds of the flock. Jesus now set before them the contrast between them
and the good Shepherd, and He pointed to Himself as the real keeper of
the Lord's flock."—"The Desire of Ages," pages 470, 477.

                             JESUS THE SERVANT
    3. "With the four Gospels in existence, no one doubts or can doubt that
Jesus of Nazareth fulfilled the cry, 'Behold My servant' [Isa. 42:1]. With
Him it ceased to be a mere ideal, and took its place as the greatest achieve-
ment in history."—"The Expositor's Bible" (Isaiah, volume 2), page 286.
    "All this parallel between Jesus of Nazareth and the Servant of the Lord
is unmistakable enough, . . . but the details of the Gospel narrative and
the language of the evangelists still more emphasize it. Christ's herald
hailed Him with words which gather, up the essence of Isaiah 53: 'Behold
the Lamb of God' [John 1:29]. He read His own commission from chapter
61: 'The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me.' [Luke 4:18.] To describe His
first labors among the people, His disciples again used words from chapter
53: 'Himself bare our sickness.' [Matt. 8:17.] To paint His manner of
working in face of opposition they quoted the whole passage from chapter
42: 'Behold My servant. . . . He shall not strive.' [Matt. 12:18, 19.] The
name 'servant' was often upon- His own lips in presenting Himself 'Behold,
 I am among you as one that serveth.' [Luke 22:27.] . . . He predicted for
Himself the treatment which is detailed in chapter 50,— the smiting, pluck-
ing and spitting: and in time, by Jew and gentile, this treatment was in-
flicted on Him to the very letter."— Id., pages 284, 285.

   •       •             THE CHURCH THE SERVANT
    4. "With this witness, then, of history to the prophecies of the servant,
our way in expounding and applying them is clear. Jesus Christ is their
perfect fulfillment and illustration. But we who are His church are to find
in them our ideal and duty,— our duty to God and to the world. In this,
as in so many other matters, the unfulfilled prophecy of Israel is the con-
science of Christianity."— Id., page 289.
     •                  JESUS THE KINSMAN-REDEEMER
    5. "There is a scripture here [in the book of Ruth] within a scripture
gospel truth under a veil of charming narrative. A greater than Boaz is
here — Christ the Lord of the harvest, the Supplier of wants, the Redeemer
of the inheritance, the Man who gives rest, the near Kinsman, the Bride-
groom of the church."—"Synoptical Lectures," .page 81.

   • SEED THOUGHT:   "Christ . . . the Lord of life and glory."
 —"The Desire of Ages," page 707.
    1. In his address before the council, Stephen spoke of
 God as "the God of glory" (Acts 7: 2) ; and the Son of God,
 even in the hour of His greatest humiliation, was "the Lord
 of glory" (1 Cor. 2: 8). When Christ returned to heaven,
 He was hailed as "the King of glory" (Ps. 24: 7-10) ; and on
 the Day of Pentecost, in the first public address after the
36          SABBATH SCHOOL 'LESSON QUARTERLY •

crucifixion, the apostle Peter testified to the exalted position
to which Jesus the crucified had been raised (Acts 2: 36).
    2. In his first address to the gentiles, the same apostle
 recognized Jesus Christ as "Lord of all" (Acts 10: 36) ;
and the same expression is applied to Him in His relation to
both Jew and Greek (Rom. 10: 12). So also He is declared to
be "over all" (Rom. 9: 5), and His place is the first among
all (Col. 1: 18). In Paul's preaching, Jesus was proclaimed
as Lord. 2 Cor. 4: 5, A. R. V.
    3. In His farewell conversation with His disciples, Jesus
affirmed that He was both "Teacher and Lord" (John 13: 13,
A. R. V.), as He had already referred to Himself as "the
Lord" (Luke 19: 30, 31), and salvation is assured by recog-
nizing Him "as Lord (Rom. 10: 9), but such confession can
only be made "in the Holy Spirit" (1 Cor. 12: 3, A. R. V.).
    4. Through His death and resurrection, Christ' acquired
His lordship (Rom. 14: 9) ; and He who as a lamb was "led
to the slaughter," was later declared to be "Lord-of lords"
 (Rev. 17: 14).
    5. It is "the Lord Himself" who will return for His people
(1 Thess. 4: 16) ; and it will be the eternal joy of the right-
eous to "ever be with the Lord" (1 Thess. 4: 17), according
to the expressed wish of Jesus Himself (John 17: 24), and to
join with every living being in the universe in confessing Jesus
Christ as Lord (Phil. 2: 8-11).
    6. The scriptures used in this lesson exalt in the highest
degree the person of Jesus our Saviour, and furnish a sure
ground for confidence that'He is able to do "exceeding abun-
dantly" for us. Eph.' 3: 20.
                          Questions
    1. What descriptive title did Stephen apply to God in his
address before the council? Acts 7: 2.
    2. What title is used of the Son of God when referring
to His crucifixion? 1 Cor. 2: 8.

                   •              Notes
    1. "After Jesus had blessed His disciples, He was parted from them, and
taken up. And as He led the way upward, the multitude of captives who
were raised at His resurrection followed. A multitude of the heavenly host
were in attendance, while in heaven an innumerable company of angels
awaited His coming. As they ascended to the holy city, the angels who
escorted Jesus cried out, 'Lift up your heads, 0 ye gates, and be ye lifted
up, ye everlasting doors, and the King of glory shall come in.' The angels
in the city cried out with rapture, 'Who is this King of glory?' The escort-
ing angels answered in triumph, 'The Lord strong and mighty ! The Lord
mighty in battle! Lift up your heads, 0 ye gates, even lift them up, ye
everlasting doors, and the King of glory shall come in !' Again the waiting
angels asked, 'Who is this King of glory?' and the escorting angels answered
in melodious strains, 'The Lord of hosts I He is the King of glory 1' And
the heavenly train passed into the city of God."—"Early Writings," pages
190, 191.
                          SON OF GOD, SON OF MAN

    2. "'Wherefore God also hath highly exalted Him, and given Him a
name which is above every name.' For still we must think of Him as One
that has come down into the region of the creatures, the region in which
we are distinguished by names, and are capable of higher and lower in end-
less degrees. God, dealing with Him so situated, acts in a manner rightly
corresponding to this great self-dedication, so as to utter God's mind upon
it. He has set Him on high, and given Him the name that is above every
name ; so that divine honor shall be• rendered to Him by all creation, and
knees bowed in worship to Him everywhere, and all shall own Him Lord —
that is, partaker of divine sovereignty. All this is 'to the glory of God the
Father,' seeing that in all this the worthiness and beauty of God's being
and ways come to the light with a splendor heretofore unexampled.
    "So then, we may say, perhaps, that as in the humiliation He who is
God experienced what it is to be man, now in the exaltation He who is
man experiences what it is to be God."—"The Expositor's Bible" (Philip-
 pians), page 122.

                            Synopsis
    SEED THOUGHT: "Other foundation can no man lay than
that is laid, which is Jesus Christ." 1 Cor. 3: 11.
   1. From the reading of the four Gospels, it is plain that
Jesus, in His teaching, made the attitude of men toward Him
the crucial test of their Christianity. Those who confessed
Him would be confessed by Him, while those who denied Him
would be denied by *Him. Luke. 12: 8, 9. Those who were
ashamed of Him, of them He would be ashamed. Luke 9: 26.
One who loved those nearest of kin more than Jesus, was
not worthy of Him (Matt. 10: 37) ; but those who received
Him received the Father who sent Him (Matt. 10: 40).
    2. From the cloud on the mount of transfiguration, there
came a voice directing us to hear the Son (Mark 9: 7) ; and
the Son commands, "Come unto Me" (Matt. 11: 28) ; "Learn
of Me" (Matt. 11: 29) ; "Believe also in Me" (John 14: 1) ;
"Follow Me" (John 1: 43) ; "Abide in Me" (John 15: 4). We
can thus see that "Christianity is nothing less and can be
nothing more than relationship to Christ.'
    3. If we are "separate from Christ," we are utterly un-
done (Eph. 2: 11, 12, A. R. V.) ; but if we possess Christ, we
have all (Rom. 8: 32). Those who receive Him are privileged
to become children of God (John 1: 12), and they live by
feeding upon Him (John 6: 57). Those who have Him have
eternal life (1 John 5: 11, 12), and every spiritual blessing
 (Eph. 1: 3).
    4. Faith in Christ is the essential condition of salvation
 (Acts 16: 30, 31) — the faith which sees in Jesus the I AM of
the Old Testament (John 8: 24), and accepts Him as the Lord
of the life (John 20: 28). Then He dwells in us (Eph. 3: 17),
and becomes in us our "hope of glory" (Col. 1: 27).
             SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                          39
    5. In Christ we walk (Col. 2: 6), by abiding in Him we
bear fruit (John 15: 5), in Him we find our fullness (Col.
2: 9, 10), and we can well afford to sacrifice everything else
if we can be found in Him at last (Phil. 3: 8, 9).
                           Questions
    1. What did Jesus make the crucial test of Christianity?
See synopsis, paragraph 1.
    2. What will Jesus do for those who confess Him, and
what for those who deny Him? Luke 12: 8, 9.

else.? Phil. 3: 8, 9.
                    •        Notes
                    CHRIST THE SCIENCE OF SALVATION
   1. "Christ crucified for our sins, Christ risen from the dead, Christ
ascended on high, is the science of salvation that we are to learn and to
teach."-"Testimonies for the Church," volume 8, page 287.
                    CHRIST IN THE THREEFOLD MESSAGE
   2. "The truths of the third angel's message have been presented by some
as a dry theory ; but in this message is to be presented Christ the Living
40             SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
One. He is to be revealed as the first and the last, as the I AM, the Root
and the Offspring of David, and the bright and morning Star. Through
this message, the character of God in Christ is to be manifested to the
world. . . .
   "There is a great work to be done, and every effort possible must be
made to reveal Christ as the sin-pardoning Saviour, Christ as the sin-bearer,
Christ as the bright and morning Star."— Id., volume 6, pages 20, 21.
                      THE TRUTHS PRESENTED BY CHRIST
   3. "In the golden censer of truth, as presented in Christ's teachings, we
have that which will convict and convert souls. Present, in the simplicity
of Christ, the truths that He came to this world to proclaim, and the power
of your message will make itself felt. Do not present theories or tests that
Christ has never mentioned, and that have no foundation in the Bible. We
have grand, solemn truths to present. 'It is written' is the test that must
be brought home to every soul."— Id., volume 8, page 800.
                 ' CHRIST THE SUM OF CHRISTIAN TEACHING
   4. "Christ is the sum of all Christian teaching ; and, where the message
of His love is welcomed, He Himself comes in spiritual and real presence,
and dwells in the spirit."—"The Expositor's Bible" (Colossians), page 178.
                         THE PURPOSE OF THE RECORD
   5. "Let it be remembered that the study of the testimony is one thing,
and the enjoyment of the salvation is another, and that the record of the
things which Jesus did and said has attained its end with those only, who,
believing, have life through His name."—"The Progress of Doctrine,"
page 81.
                       A PECULIARITY OP CHRISTIANITY
    6. "One peculiarity of Christianity is that you cannot take its message,
and put aside Christ, the speaker of the message, as you may do with all
men's teachings. . . His person is inextricably intertwined with His teach-
ing, for a very large part of His teaching is exclusively concerned with, and
all of it centers in, Himself. He is not only true, but He is the truth. His
message is, not only what He said with His lips about God and man, but
also what He said about Himself, and what He did in His life, death, and
resurrection."—"The Expositor's Bible" (Colossians), page 184.'
                             RECEIVING A PERSON
    7. "What we receive, when, from human lips, we hear the gospel and
accept it, is not merely the word about the Saviour, but the Saviour Him-
self."— Id., page 177.
                           THE GIFTS ARE IN HIM
     8. "We cannot get His gifts without Himself."— Id., page 67.
                       THE CHRISTIANITY OF THE BIBLE
    9. "Christianity, as revealed in the Sacred Writings, is salvation by
Christ. . . . It teaches that by Him God's justice was magnified, and His
mercy made manifest; that, for all who trust in Him, He fulfilled the law,
and brought in a complete righteousness; and that by this alone they can be
justified before God. It teaches that His death was a perfect sacrifice, and
made full satisfaction and atonement for their sins, so that God lays no
sin to their charge, but gives them a free and full pardon ; that He has
ascended to the right hand of God, and has sent down the Holy Spirit to
be His only Vicar and Representative on earth ; . . . that it is by the Holy
Spirit alone that we are convinced of sin, and led to trust in Jesus ; that
all who trust in Him, and obey Him with the obedience of faith and love,
are saved, and, being saved, are made 'kings and priests unto God,' and
have 'eternal life' in Him. This is Christianity, the Christianity which the
apostles preached."—"The Fundamentals," volume 11, pages 100, 101.
