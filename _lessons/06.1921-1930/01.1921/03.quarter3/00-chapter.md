                            Synopsis
    SEED THOUGHT: "In our humanity, Christ was to redeem
Adam's failure."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 117.
    1. The purpose of the gospel is to unite all things under
one head, in union with Christ. Eph. 1: 10. The original
head of the human family, the first Adam, was created in the
image of God, and was thus able to exercise dominion over the
earth. Gen. 1: 26. Through sin, he lost the glory, the char-
acter, of God (Rom. 3: 23), and so lost, his dominion. As he
was the representative head of the human family, the whole
race was involved in the consequences of his sin. Rom. 5: 12.
What he did, we all did in him, just as Levi paid tithes in
Abraham. Heb. 7:.9, 10. The same principle of representa-
tion which brought'death through the first Adam, brings life
through the last Adam. 1 Cor. 15: 45, 21, 22. Without any
action of the will.of each individual, the whole human family
was brought into a state of sin by the disobedience of the first
Adam; and in the same way, without the action of the will of
each individual, the whole human family, so far as Adam's sin
was concerned, was brought into a state of righteousness by
the obedience of the last Adam. Rom. 5: 19. We participate
in the state of sin through the natural birth, and we partici-
pate in the state of righteousness through the new birth.
John 3: 3, 5, 6.
    2. In order that He might become the head of a new
humanity, Christ was born of a woman (Gal. 4: 4), and be-
came the Son of man, while He continued to be the Son of God
 (Matt. 16: 13-16). As the Son of man, He accepted the limi-
tations and conditions of our common humanity (Heb. 2: 9,
10, 17) ; but at the same time, He gave abundant proof that
 He was the Son of God (John 20: 30, 31). As the Son of man,
 the representative of the human family, He was betrayed
 (Matt. 17: 22), He was crucified (Matt. 26: 2), He was buried
4           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

(Matt. 12: 40), He was raised from the dead (Matt. 17: 9),
He ascended to heaven (John 6: 62) ; and as the Son of man, '
He is at the right hand of God (Acts 7: 56).
    3. What was done for us by Christ as the Son of man, the
representative of the human family, is regarded as having
been done by us in Him. Since He died for all, all died in
Him (2 Cor. 5: 14, A. R. V.), and thus the penalty incurred
through the sin of the first Adam was fully met (Isa. 53: 6),
so that the great sin for which we shall be condemned in the
final Judgment will be our failure to believe on Christ and
thus to find salvation from the actual sins which we have
ourselves committed (John 16: 9).
    4. After Adam lost the image of God through sin, he begot
a son in his own image (Gen. 5: 3) ; and we share in that like-
ness by our natural birth (1 Cor. 15: 48, first clause). Christ
is the image of God (Col. 1: 15), and we share in that likeness
by the spiritual birth (1 Cor. 15: 48, last clause). Thus do
we become new creatures "in Christ" (2 Cor. 5: 17), and
become "accepted in the Beloved" (Eph. 1: 6).

    2. Why was the first Adam able to exercise dominion over

    4. Why was the whole race involved in the consequences
 of his sin? Rom. 5: 12.
    5. How has the working of this principle been illustrated
 to us? Heb. 7: 9, 10.
    6. What is accomplished for us through Christ by the
 application of this same representative principle? 1 Cor. 15:
45, 21, 22.
    7. In what statement of the Scriptures is this representa-
 tive character of the two Adams set forth? Rom. 5: 19.
    8. How do we participate in the state of sin? Of right-
 eousness? .John 3: 3, 5, 6.
    9. Through what experience did Christ become the head
 of a new humanity? Gal. 4: 4.
   10. What nature did He at the same time retain? Matt.
16: 13-16.
   11. What limitations did He accept as the Son of man?
 Heb. 2: 9, 10, 17.
   12. Of what did He at the same time give abundant proof?
 John 20: 30, 31.
   13. In what representative character was He betrayed
 (Matt. 17: 22), crucified (Matt. 26: 2), buried (Matt. 12: 40),
 raised from the dead (Matt. 17: 9), and taken to heaven
•(John 6: 62)?

  14. In what representative capacity is He now at the right -
hand of God? Acts 7: 56.

   22. In whom do we thus become accepted? Eph. 1: 6.
                              Notes
                     THE MEANING OF CHRIST'S DEATH
   1. "Paul delivers to men first of all that'Christ died for our sins, accord-
ing to the Scriptures ; this is the divinely laid foundation of the gospel.
1 Cor. 15: 3. He died for all, so then all died - their death was somehow
involved and comprehended in His."-"Jesus and the Gospel," p. 37.
                      CHRIST BORE THE GUILT OF ALL
    2. "Upon Christ as our substitute and surety was laid the iniquity of us
all. He was counted a transgressor, that He might redeem us from the con-
demnation of the lavi. The guilt of every descendant of Adam was pressing
upon His heart."-"The Desire of Ages," p. 752.




           Lesson       2-   The Essential Gospel

                          Synopsis
    SEED THOUGHT:   "The spring of life is love to God and
man. Christ is Christianity."-"Gospel Workers," p. 282.
   1. In order that He might destroy the devil and deliver
us from the bondage of sin, Christ took the same flesh that we
have (Heb. 2: 14), and thus became the last Adam, the head
and representative of a new humanity (1 Cor. 15: 45). What
He did as the head of this new humanity, the representative
 6           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

  man, is regarded as having been done by the human family
  in Him. Rom. 5: 19. Our standing with God therefore de-
  pends wholly upon our personal relation to our Head and
  Representative through our faith in Him as our Saviour. The
  essential gospel is therefore the good news concerning Christ,
  the Son of God (Rom. 1: 1-3), and what He has done for us
  and in our stead; our personal acceptance of Christ, both in
  what, He has done for us and in what He will do in us, brings
  to us the assurance of our salvation through His infinite
  merit (John 1: 12).
     2. The foundation of the gospel is in what Christ is to us,
  and what He has done for us. 1 Cor. 3: 11. The death and
  the resurrection of Christ are the p'rimary facts of.the gospel.
  1 Cor. 15: 3, 4. Through our union with Christ and our ac-
  ceptance of these experiences as our own, we personally share
  in all the benefits which spring from them. This union com-
  mences when we accept His death as our death. Gal. 6: 14.
  This is taking up the cross (Matt. 16: 24; Gal. 5: 24), and is
• to be a daily experience (1 Cor. 15: 31). In this way, we put
  off the old man. Rom. 6: 6, A. R. V.; Col. 3: 9.
      3. In baptism, we make a public profession of our union
  with Christ in His death (Rom. 6: 3), thus declaring that we
 "died with Christ" (Col. 2: 20, A. R. V.). But Christ died
  "unto sin" (Rom. 6: 10) ; and when we accept His experi-
  ence as our own, we have "died to sin" (verses 1, 2, A. R. V.),
  and must so regard ourselves (verse 11). By constant union
  with Him in His death, we put to death our sinful members.
  Col. 3: 3, 5, A. R. V. By such a death, we are released from
  sin. Rom. 6: 7, A. R. V.
     4. The wages of sin is death (Rom. 6: 23), and we must
  meet this penalty either in Christ or in ourselves. If we be-
  come sharers in Christ's crucifixion, we may thus satisfy all
  the claims of the law. Gal. 2: 19, 20, A. R. V.; Rom. 7: 6,
  A. R. V.
                             Questions
     1. For what purposes did Christ take our flesh? Heb. 2: 14.
     2. Who did He thus become? 1 Cor. 15: 45.
     3. How does God regard what He did as the representative
  man? Rom. 5: 19.
      4. Upon what therefore does our standing with God de-
  pend? See synopsis, paragraph 1.
     5. What is the essential gospel? Rom. 1: 1-3.
     6. What will bring to us the assurance of our salvation?
 John 1: 12.
     7. In what is the foundation of the gospel? 1 Cor. 3: 11.
     8. What are the primary facts of the gospel? 1 Cor.
15:3, 4.
              SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                                7

    9. How may we share in the benefits'which spring from
these facts? See synopsis, paragraph 2, first part.
  10. Where does this union commence? Gal. 6: 14.
  11. What does this mean to us? Matt. 16: 24; Gal. 5: 24.
  12. How often is this experience to be entered upon? 1 Cor.
15: 31.
  13. Who is thus crucified? Rom. 6: 6, A. R. V.; Col. 3: 9.
  14. Of what do we make a profession in baptism? Rom. 6:3.
  15. What do we thus -declare? Col. 2: 20, A. R. V.
  16. Unto what did Christ die? Rom. 6: 10.
  17. When we accept His death as our death, what experi-
ence should this bring to us? Verses 1, 2, A. R. V.
  18. How must we then regard ourselves? Verse 11.
  19. By such a union; what may we put to death? Col. 3:
3, 5, A. R. V.
   20. From what are we thus released? Rom. 6: 7, A. R. V.
   21. What are the wages of sin? Verse 23.
   22. How may we satisfy all the claims of the law upon us?
Gal. 2: 19, 20, A. R. V.; Rom. 7 : 6, A. R. V.
                                   Notes
                   CHRIST'S EXPERIENCES WROUGHT IN US
   I. "There is an acting over again in us of Christ's crucifixion, resurrec-
tion, and ascension, when we realize through faith that which was done for
mankind in Him."—"The Expositor's Bible" (Ephesians), P. 96.

                     THE ACCEPTANCE OF CHRIST'S WORK
    2. "What Christ has done for you is yours, so far as you accept it. He
has died your death beforehand, trusting that you would not repudiate His
act, that you would not let His blood be spilt in vain. But He will never
force His mediation upon you. . . . Do you now endorse what Jesus Christ
did on your behalf? Do you renounce the sin, and accept the sacrifice?
Then it is yours, from this moment, before the tribunal of God and of con-
science. By the witness of His Spirit you are proclaimed a . forgiven and
reconciled man. Christ crucified is yours — if you will have Him, if you
will identify your sinful self with the sinless Mediator, if as you see Him
lifted up on the cross you will let your heart cry out, 'Oh my God, He dies
for me.' "— Id:, p. 142.
                        AN EXCHANGE OF CHARACTER
    3. "He, [Christ] died for us, and - now He offers to take our sins and give
us His righteousness. If you give•yourself to Him, and accept Him as your
Saviour, then, sinful as your life may have been, for His sake you are ac-
counted righteous. Christ's character stands in place of your character,
and you are accepted before God just as if you had not sinned."—"Steps to
Christ," p. 67, old edition; 1). 78, new edition.

                              Synopsis
    SEED THOUGHT:       "The spring of life is love to God and
 man. Christ is Christianity."—"Gospel Workers," p. 282.
      1. The significance of the death of Christ lies in the fact
 that it was Christ the Son of God who was crucified, whom it'
•was not possible that death should hold. Acts 2: 24. Our
 union with Christ is not confined to His death, but includes
 His resurrection (Rom. 6: 5, A. R. V.), and a new life (verse
4), in which we live with Him (verse 8, A. R. V.).
      2. The resurrection of Christ is absolutely necessary for
 our salvation (1 Cor. 15: 17) ; for He was raised "for our
 justification" (Rom. 4: 25), and we are "saved by His life"
 (Rom. 5: 10). His life of righteousness is imputed'to us for
 our justification when we accept Him by believing on Him
  (Rom. 3: 25, 26), but this is Only the beginning of our Chris-
 tian experience. For the purpose of study, we may separate
 between justification and sanctification; but Christ is not
 divided, and we accept not simply a Christ who has lived and
 died, but a Christ who lives after dying (Rev. 1: 17, 18), and
 whose life, triumphant over death, is manifested in us here
 and now (2 Cor. 4: 10, 11). Christ lives, the risen Saviour
  (Luke 24: 5, 6) ; and He lives in each one who has been cruci-
 fied with Him and lives the life of faith (Gal. 2: 20). This is
 the very essence of the gospel. Col. 1: 27.
      3. In our controversy with sin, it is our privilege to realize
 the working of the same power which raised Christ from the
 dead (Eph. 1: 18-20), if we are willing to become conformed
 to His death (Phil. 3: 10). It was by this "power of an end-
 less life" that Christ became our high priest (Heb. 7: 16), and
 it is this life-power ministered to us which enables us to over-
 come sin and•death (Rom. 8: 2). When we are alienated from
 this life, we live the worldly life. Eph. 4: 17, 18.
      4. Christ brought heaven down to earth (Matt. 12: 28) ;
 and consequently, through our union with Him, we are not •
 only raised "with Him," but we are made "to sit with Him in
 the heavenly places" (Eph. 2: 4-6, A. R. V.). In view of such
 a resurrection, we should stay our minds upon heavenly
 things. Col. 3: 1, 2.
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     9
     5. It is thus evident that our whole success in the Christian
life depends upon our unbroken union with Christ. John 15:
4, 5. Our part is to maintain this union by accepting daily
His death as our death, and His resurrection life as our life;
and this will open the way for God to work in us (Phil. 2:
12, 13), making us "perfect in every good thing to do His will"
through the power which brought Christ from the dead (Heb.
13: 20, 21, A. R. V.).
                              Questions

from the death of any other person? Acts 2: 24.

                           Notes
                  RESURRECTION POWER IN THE NEW LIFE
   1. "This same resurrection power is that which gives life to the soul
'dead in trespasses and sins.' That spirit of life in Christ Jesus, 'the power
of His resurrection,' sets men 'free from the law of sin and death.' The
dominion of evil is broken, and through faith the soul is kept from sin. He
who opens his heart to the Spirit of Christ becomes a partaker of that
mighty power which shall bring forth his body from the grave."—"The
Desire of Ages," pp. 209, 210.
      •           THE MEANING OF UNION WITH CHRIST
   2. "Believers are in Christ, so as to be partakers in all that He does,
and has, and is. They died with Him, and rose with Him, and live with
Him, and in Him are seated in heavenly places. When the eye of God
looks on them they are found in Christ, and there is no condemnation to
those that are in Him, and they are righteous in His righteousness, and
loved with the love which rests on Him, and are sons of God in His son-
ship, and heirs with Him of His inheritance, and are soon to be glorified
with Him in His glory."—"The Progress of Doctrine," p. 166.
                            HEAVEN BEGINS HERE
   3. "As through Jesus we enter into rest, heaven begins here. We re-
spond to His invitation, Come, learn of Me, and in thus coming we begin
the life eternal. Heaven is a ceaseless approaching to God through Christ.
The longer we are in the heaven of bliss, the more and still more of glory
will be opened to us ; and the more we know of Godo.the more intense will
be our happiness. As we walk with Jesus in this life, we may be filled with
His love, satisfied with His presence. All that human nature can bear, we
may receive here. But what is this compared with the hereafter?"—"The
Desire of Ages," p. 391.

   SEED THOUGHT: "The impartation of the Spirit is the
impartation of the life of Christ."—"Gospel Workers," p. 285.
  1. When the Sun of God was born of a woman (Gal. 4: 4),
and partook of our sinful flesh (Rom. 8: 3), the eternal life
was manifested in a human body (1 John 1: 2). In Him,
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  11

divinity ana humanity were united (John 1: 1, 14), and the
presence of God was with men (Matt. 1: 23).
    2. When Jesus was about to leave His disciples, He prom-
ised that His continued presence should be with them (Matt.
28: 20), and He explained to them how this promise would be
fulfilled. When His bodily presence was withdrawn from
them, the Father would send "another Comforter" (John 14:
16), the Holy Spirit (verse 26), the Spirit of truth, who would
be in them (verse 17). The coming of the Comforter would
mean His own presence with them (verse 18), so that they
would behold Him, and His life would be their life (verse 19).
Thus a living union would be established between the Father,
the Son, and the believer (verse 20), and Jesus would be per-
sonally manifested to him (verse 21). This manifestation
would not be in a bodily presence visible to the natural eye.
 (verse 22), but would be an indwelling presence of both the
Father and the Son (verse 23).
    8. This was the intimate personal fellowship for which
Christ prayed (John 17: 20, 21, A. R. V.), and which we may
all have as an experience (1 John 1: 3). The Christ who
lived in Judea set us an example (1 Peter 2: 21) ; but a
present Christ who lives in us (Gal. 2: 20) through the com-
ing of the Comforter, must be our power (1 Cor. 1: 23, 24),
enabling us to walk as He walked (1 John 2: 6) , because He
walks in us (2 Cor. 6: 16), and we walk in Him (Col. 2: 6).
                          Questions
    1. How. was the Son of God brought into the world?.
Gal. 4: 4..
    2. Of what kind of flesh did He partake? Rom. 8: 3.

    4. What new combination was then revealed to the world?
John 1: 1, 14.
    5. Whose presence was made manifest among men? Matt.
1: 23.
    6. What promise did Jesus make to His disciples just
before leaving them? Matt. 28: 20.
    7. Whom did He say the Father would send as His suc-
cessor? John 14:16.
    8. Whom did He declare the Comforter to be? Verses
26, 17.
    9. What would the coming of the Comforter mean to them?
Verse 18.
   10. How intimate would their union with Christ thus be-
come? Verse 19.
   11. What threefold union would in this way be established?
Verse 20.
12            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

   12. Who would be personally manifested to the believer?
. Verse 21.
   13. What would mark the difference between this and the
 previous manifestation of Christ? Verse 22.
   14. Whose indwelling presence would abide with those who
 love Christ? Verse 23.
   15. What experience did Christ desire for all believers?
 John 17: 20, 21, A. R. V.
   16. What assurance have we that this experience may be
 ours? 1 John 1: 3.
   17. What do we have in the recorded life of Christ?
1 Peter 2: 21.
   18. How does Christ become our power to follow this ex-
 ample? Gal. 2: 20; 1 Cor. 1:23, 24.
   19. What shall we thus be enabled to do? 1 John L: 6.
   20. Who walks in us? 2 Cor. 6: 16.
   21. In whom do we walk? Col. 2: 6.
                            Note
                         CHRIST AND THE COMFORTER
   1. In studying the statements of Christ concerning the ComfOrter, in
the fourteenth chapter of John, it is important to observe carefully His
use of the pronouns "I" and "Me." Thus His assurance, "I come unto
you," in verse 18, is His own explanation of the coming of the Comforter
promised in verse 16 ; and His "I in you," in verse 20, is His explanation
of the Comforter "in you," of verse 17. His statement, "Ye behold Me,"
in verse 19, is fulfilled_ when He manifests Himself through the Spirit.
Verse 21.
                          A CONDITIONAL PROMISE.
   2. "Christ promised the gift of the Holy Spirit to His church, and the
promise belongs as much to us as to the first disciples. But like every other
promise, it is given on conditions. There are many who profess to believe
and claim the Lord's promises ; they talk about Christ and the Holy Spirit ;
yet they receive no benefit, because they do not surrender their souls to the
guidance and control of divine agencies. . . . Only to those who wait humbly
upon God, who watch for His guidance and grace, is the Spirit given. This
promised blessing, claimed by faith, brings all other blessings in its train."
"Gospel Workers," pp. 284, 285.
                      A VOICESILENCING OTHER VOICES
   3. "Those who are under the influence of the Spirit of God will not be
fanatical, but calm and steadfast, free from extravagance in thought, word,
or deed. Amid the confusion of delusive doctrines, the Spirit of God will
be a guide and a shield to those who have not resisted the evidences of
truth, silencing every other voice but that which comes from Him who is
the truth."— Id., p. 289.
                      A MOST INTIMATE FELLOWSHIP
    4. "The Holy Spirit is Christ's representative, but divested of the per-
sonality of humanity, and independent thereof. Cumbered with humanity,
Christ could not be in every place personally. Therefore it was for their
interest that He should go to the Father, and send the Spirit to be His suc-
cessor on earth. No one could then have any advantage because of his
location or his personal contact with Christ. By the Spirit the Saviour
would be accessible to all. In this sense He would be nearer to them than
if He had not ascended on high."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 669.

                THE ASSURED PRESENCE OF. THE COMFORTER
   5. "At all times and in all places, in all sorrows and in all afflictions,
when the outlook seems dark and the future perplexing, and we feel help-
less and alone, the Comforter will be sent in answer to the prayer of faith.
Circumstances may separate us from every earthly friend ; but no circum-
stances, no distance, can separate us from the heavenly Comforter. Wher-
ever we are, wherever we may go, He is always at our right hand to
support, sustain, uphold, and cheer."— Id., pp. 669, 670.




   Lesson      5 —• The       Presence of the Comforter

                            Synopsis
    Sim) THOUGHT: "On the Day of Pentecost the Infinite One
revealed Himself in power to the church."—"Testimonies for
the Church," volume 7, p. 31.
   1. .Every one who conquers sin needs to be strengthened
with all power (Col. 1: 11) ; and in view of this, Jesus in-
structed His disciples to wait for this power (Luke' 24: 49;
Acts 1: 4). This power was for witnessing, and was to be
received through the coming of the Holy Spirit, the Com-
forter. Acts 1: 8. After an. experience of preparation for
receiving the promised blessing (Acts 1: 14), the risen and
ascended Lord, from the throne upon which He sat as priest
 (Heb. 8: 1, 2), poured out upon His disciples the riches of the
Spirit's power (Acts 2: 1-4, 33), thus fulfilling the Pentecostal
type (Lev. 23: 15, 16). From that time, and as the result of
the coming of the Comforter, the disciples became the channels •
of a new life (John 7: 38), and were made "sufficient as minis-
ters of a new covenant" (2 Cor. 3: 5, 6, A. R. V.). The evi-
dence of this was seen in the results of their work (Acts
2: 41; 4: 4), as they gave their witness "with great power"
 (Acts 4: 33).
    2. The Spirit of God has been active from the beginning
 (Gen. 1: 2), as the revelation of God's power (Micah 3: 8),
and the interpreter of His revealed will (Ex. 35: 30, 31) ; but
the Spirit of Jesus (Acts 16: 7, A. R. V.), the Spirit of Jesus
Christ (Phil. 1: 19), is the Spirit of Him who is both God
and man (Rom. 9: 5; 1 Tim. 2: 5), who as man has conquered
the world (John 16: 33), and has triumphed over death (Rom.
14         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

6: 9). In order that the Spirit might come in such a capacity
as the Comforter, it was necessary that Jesus should be glori-
fied (John 7: 38, 39), through His death and resurrection
 (John 12: 23, 24). The Son of God was with the Father
before He came to this world (John 17: 5) ; but when He
became the Son of man, a new manifestation appeared, "God
with us" (Matt. 1: 23). The man, Jesus of Nazareth, was
anointed with the Holy Spirit (Acts 10: 38) ; it was "through
the eternal Spirit" that Christ offered Himself to God (Heb.
9: 14) ; the risen Lord is identified with the Spirit (2 Cor.
3: 17) ; and thus the Holy Spirit is the representative of the
new order, and in this sense "was not given" until after the
death and resurrection of Christ.

                           Notes
                     THE TOKEN OF CHRIST'S AUTHORITY
   1. "Christ's ascension to heaven was the signal that His followers were
to receive the promised blessing. For this they were to wait before they
entered upon their work. When Christ., passed within the heavenly gates,
He was enthroned amidst the adoration of the angels. As soon as this
ceremony was completed, the Holy Spirit descended upon the disciples in
rich currents, and Christ was indeed glorified, even with the glory which
He had with the Father from all eternity."—"The Acts of the Apostles,"
pp. 38, 39.
                         "BE FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT"
   2. "As the disciples, filled with the power of the Spirit, went forth to
proclaim the gospel, so God's servants are to go forth to-day. Filled with
an unselfish desire to give the message of mercy to those who are in the
darkness of error and unbelief, we are to take up the Lord's work. He
gives us our part to do in cooperation with Him, and He will also move on
the hearts of unbelievers to carry forward His work in the regions beyond.
Already many are receiving the Holy Spirit, and no longer will the way be
blocked by listless indifference."—"Testimonies for the Church," volume 7,
pp. 32,83.

    SEED   THOUGHT:     "The work of the Spirit        is   immeasurably
great."—"Gospel Workers," p. 289.
   1. The return of Christ to heaven did not deprive believers
of any blessing, but rather opened the way for a greater
blessing. John 16: 7. His presence through the Spirit made
possible a more intimate fellowship with Him than was pos-
sible when He was here in the flesh. John 14: 20. The Spirit
bears witness (1 John 5: 7) ; and as the Comfrrter,. He bears
16           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

 witness of Christ (John 15:26), by communicating the pres-
  ence of Christ (1 John 3:24).
     2. In the Scriptures, "the Spirit of God" and "the Spirit
  of Christ" and "Christ" are so joined as to show that the
  presence of either one involves the presence of the others
  (Rom. 8: 9-11), just as the Father, the Son, and •the Holy
- Spirit are joined in an absolute unity in the baptismal formula
  (Matt. 28: 19). One who does not possess this Spirit does
  not belong to Christ. Rom. 8: 9, last clause. The indwelling
  Spirit brings the assurance that we are children of God (Rom.
8: 16), and is the testimony to our sonship (Gal. 4: 6).
  Through His agency, the love of God is imparted to us (Rom.
5: 5), and a new life is begotten in us (John 3: 5).
     3. The Comforter is imparted to believers ("unto you,"
 John 16: 7, last clause), in order that through them He may
 convict the world of three things (verse 8). He glorifies
  Christ (verse 14), and in this way convicts of sin (verse 9;
 John 15: 22). The Spirit of Christ with the Father, present
 in many believers, convicts of righteousness. John 16: 10.
  The Spirit of the risen, Christ testifies to the judgment upon
 the prince of evil through the cross (John 12: 31, 32), and
 so convicts the world of judgment upon all who are "in the
 evil one" (John 16: 11; 1 John 5: 19, A. R. V.).
     4. The Comforter, the Spirit of truth, guides into "all the
 truth" `(John 16: 13, A. R. V.), revealing the truth as it is in
 Jesus (Eph. 4: 20, 21), and is the efficient teacher who brings
 to remembrance the words of Christ (John 14: 26). Thus the
 Holy Spirit, -the Comforter, represents Christ in the earth,
 and carries to completion the work which He commenced when
 He was here in the flesh.
                          Questions
   1. Why was it better for the disciples, and` for us, that
Christ should return to heaven? John 16: 7.

the Spirit of Christ represent Christ? Rom. 8: 9, 10.

    SEED THOUGHT:          "We cannot use the Holy Spirit. The
Spirit is to use us."-"The Desire of Ages," p. 672.
   1. In the book of Acts, we see the Comforter taking His
place in the church, and, as the personal representative of
18          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

Christ, carrying forward His work through human instru-
mentalities. First the promise concerning the Comforter,
He "shall be in you" (John 14: 17), was fulfilled (Acts 2: 4) ;
and then His work in convicting of sin was apparent (verse
37), and was continuous (verse 47). When Peter spoke to
the rulers of the people "filled with the Holy Spirit" (Acts
4: 8), they recognized his fellowship with Jesus (verse 13)
When this experience was reported to the believers, and they
had prayed for boldness to continue their work (verse 29),
they received a fresh infilling of the Spirit and the answer to
their prayer (verse gi.).
    2. So vivid was the recognition of the presence of a divine
Person in the church, that when Ananias misrepresented the
price of his property, he was charged with lying to the Holy
Spirit (Acts 5: 3), and this was declared to be lying to God
 (verse 4). Peter, after bearing his testimony concerning the
death and resurrection of Jesus, affirmed that the Holy Spirit
testified to the same things (verse 32). Stephen, one of the
seven deacons, was, like the others (Acts 6: 3), endowed with
the Holy Spirit (verse 5), and spoke with such power as to
overwhelm all opposition (verse 10). He regarded a rejection
of his message as resistance of the Holy Spirit (Acts 7: 51),
and was strengthened for martyrdom by the fullness of the
Spirit and a view of Jesus Himself (verse 55).
    3. The believers in Samaria received the Holy Spirit (Acts
8: 14-17) ; and the same Spirit instructed Philip in a definite
way (verse 29), and caught him away when his work was
finished (verse 39). Saul, at his conversion, was filled with
the Holy Spirit (Acts 9: 17) ; the Holy Spirit directed Peter
to respond to the invitation of Cornelius (Acts 10: 19) ; and
the same Spirit was given to those who heard his preaching
(verse 44).
    4. The Holy Spirit directed in the choice of missionaries
 (Acts 13:2), sent them forth to their work (verse 4), and
their converts were filled with the same Spirit (verse 52).
When the brethren met at Jerusalem to decide an important
question affecting the future of the church, they recognized
that the Holy Spirit had already decided the question by His
treatment of the gentiles (Acts 15: 8) ; and in their letter to
the churches, they announced thbir agreement with His de-
cision (verse 28). The same Spirit personally directed the
movements of the missionaries (Acts 16: 6, 7), and testified
to them concerning their work (Acts 20: 22, 23). The Holy
Spirit selected the officers of the church (verse 28), and fore-
told the persecution which awaited the apostle Paul at Jeru-
salem (Acts 21: 11).

                             A MESSAGE OF POWER
  1. "The arguments of the apostles alone, though clear and convincing,
would not have removed the prejudice that had withstood so much evidence.
But the Holy Spirit sent the arguments home to hearts with divine power.
The words of the apostles were as sharp arrows of the Almighty, convicting
men of their terrible guilt in rejecting and crucifying the Lord of glory."—
"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 45.
                            HOLDING THE BLESSING
    2. "Those who at Pentecost were endued with power from on high, were
not thereby freed from further temptation and trial. As they witnessed
for truth and righteousness, they Were repeatedly assailed by the enemy of
all truth, who sought to rob them of their Christian experience. They were
compelled to strive with all their God-given powers to reach the measure of
the stature of men and women in Christ Jesus. Daily they prayed for fresh
supplies of grace. . . . Under the Holy Spirit's working, even the weakest,
by exercising faith in God, learned to improve their entrusted powers, and
to become sanctified, refined, and ennobled."— Id., pp. 49, 50.

                                Synopsis
     SEED THOUGHT: "The Holy Spirit was the highest of all
gifts that He [Jesus] could solicit from His Father for the
exaltation of His people."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 671.
    1. Jesus accepted the title of Teacher as one which be-
longed rightfully to Him (John 13: 13, A. R. V.), and this
title is applied to Him more than forty times, in the four
Gospels. When He was about to return to His Father, He
promised that the Comforter, His successor, would act as a •
Teacher who would also remind His disciples of what He
Himself had taught them. John 14: 26. The disciples were
not then prepared for a full revelation of the truth (John
16: 12) ; but the Comforter, who is the Spirit of truth (John
           SABBATH SCHOOL •LESSON QUARTERLY                21
14: 16, 17), was to guide into that full knowledge (John 16:
13, A. R. V., first clause), not speaking "from Himself" (sec-
ond clause), but only what He heard from Him whom He
represented (third clause), and declaring things yet to come
(last clause). Thus would the Comforter glorify Jesus by
acting as His spokesman. John 16: 14.
    2. When on trial before Pilate, Jesus declared that He
came into the world to bear witness to the truth (John 18:
37) ; and before leaving the world, He made provision that
the Comforter, His successor, should bear witness of Him
who is the truth (John 15: 26, A. R. V.; 14: 6). The disciples
recognized the Holy Spirit, the Comforter, as a witness with
them. Acts 5: 32. The assurance that we are children of God
comes through the testimony of the Holy Spirit, the Com-
forter. Rom. 8: 16.
    3. We have an Advocate, or Comforter, in heaven (1 John
2: 1), who intercedes for us (Heb. 7:25) ; and we have also
a Comforter upon earth, who makes intercession for us (Rom.
8: 27). Our salvation is thus doubly assured.
    4. God has placed the seal of His ownership upon us
 (2 Cor. 1: 21, 22), having sealed us "with that Holy Spirit of
promise" (Eph. 1: 13), in whom we are "sealed unto the day
of redemption" (Eph. 4: 30). This is the sign that we are
not our own. 1 Cor. 6: 19, 20.
    5. It is God's will that His children should be sanctified
 (1 Thess. 4: 3) ; and the Holy Spirit, the Comforter, is His
agent for accomplishing this work (2 Thess. 2: 13).
                             Questions
    1: What title did Jesus claim as belonging to Him? John
13 : 13, A. R. V.
    2. After Jesus returned to heaven, who took His place as
teacher? John 14: 26.
     3. Why did not Jesus make a full revelation to His dis-
 ciples? John 16: 12.
     4. Who did He say would guide them in all truth? Verse
13, A. R. V., first clause.
     5. What things would the Comforter speak? Verse 13,
 second and third clauses.
     6. What things would the Comforter declare? Verse 13,
 last clause.
     7. How would the Comforter glorify Jesus? Verse 14.
     8. For what purpose did Jesus come into the world?
 John 18: 37.
     9. How would this same testimony to the truth be main-
 tained after He left the world? John 15: 26, A. R. V.; 14: 6.
   10. In what statement did the disciples recognize. the Com-
 forter as a witness? Acts 5: 32.
22             SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

  11. What assurance comes to us through the witness of the
Comforter? Rom. 8: 16.
  12. Who is our Advocate or Comforter in heaven? 1 John 2 :1.
  13. What does He do in our behalf? Heb. 7: 25.
  14. What does the Comforter on the earth do in our be-
half? Rom. 8: 27.

2 Cor. 1: 21, 22.
  16. How have we been sealed? Eph. 1: 13.
  17. Unto what have we been sealed? Eph. 4: 30.
  18. Of what is this sealing work the sign? 1 Cor. 6: 19, 20.
  19. What is God's will concerning His children? 1 Thess.
4: 3.
  20. Who is the agent for accomplishing this work?

                            Notes
                          THE EFFECTUAL TEACHER
   1. "The preaching of the Word will be of no avail without the continual
presence and aid of the Holy Spirit. This is the only effectual teacher
of divine truth. Only when the truth is accompanied to the heart by the
Spirit, will it quicken the conscience or transform the life."—"The Desire
of Ages," p. 671.
                            SPEAKS IN THE WORD
   2. "God's holy, educating Spirit is in His Word. A light, a new and
precious light, shines forth from every page. Truth is there revealed, and
words and sentences are made bright and appropriate for the occasion, as
the voice of God speaking to them."—"Counsels to Teachers," p.
                          WAY TO BE PREPARED
   3. "For the outpouring of the Spirit every lover of the cause of truth
should pray. And as far as lies in our power, we are to remove every hin-
drance to His worliing. The Spirit can never be poured out while variance
and bitterness toward one another are cherished by the members of the
church."—"Testimonies for the Church," volume 6, p. 42.
                           PROYIDKNCES AND POWER
    4. "From all countries the Macedonian cry is sounding, 'Come over and
help us.' . . . When the reproach of indolence and slothfulness shall have
been wiped away from the church, the Spirit of the Lord will be graciously
manifested. Divine power will be revealed. The church will see the provi-
dential working of the Lord of hosts. The light of truth will shine forth in
clear, strong rays, and as in the time of the apostles, many souls will turn
from error to truth. The earth will be lighted with the glory of the Lord."—
Id., volume 9, p. 46.
                            IN THE CLOSING WORK
    5. "The great work of the gospel is not to close with less manifestation
of the power of God than marked its opening. The prophecies which were
fulfilled in the outpouring of the former rain at the opening of the gospel,
are again to be fulfilled in the latter rain at its close. . . . Servants of God,
with their faces lighted up and shining with holy consecration, will hasten
from place to place to proclaim the message from heaven. By thousands of
voices, all over the earth, the warning will be given."—"The Great Con-
troversy," pp. 611, 612.

    SEED THOUGHT : "The need, the peril, the greatness of the
time will be the measure of the gift of Christ."—"The Ex-
positor's Bible" (Ephesians), p. 242.
   1. The return of Christ to heaven was the signal for be-
stowing special gifts upon His followers who were left on the
earth. Eph. 4: 7, 8. These gifts are of various kinds (verse
11), and are designed for the accomplishment of a specific
work (verse 12). That this is not a complete enumeration of
the gifts, and that the order is not especially significant, is
shown by another enumeration. 1 Cor. 12: 28.
    2. Under ordinary conditions, these gifts were bestowed
upon different persons (verses 29, 30) ; but they were all
exercised by Jesus while He was here in the flesh. These
gifts all proceed from the same Spirit (verse 4), and are
profitable to the church (verse 7). "The word of wisdom"
and "the word of knowledge" are first mentioned (verse 8),
then faith and healings (verse 9), followed by miracles,
prophecy, discerning of spirits, tongues, and their interpreta-
tion (verse 10). These gifts are not granted according to the
choice of the receivers, but according to the will of the Spirit.
Verse 11. The exercise of these gifts is revealed in the per-
sonal experience of the individual. Rom. 12: 6-8.
    3. The love of God is bestowed through the Holy Spirit
 (Rom. 5: 5), and this is of primary importance (1 Cor. 13:
1, 2). All spiritual gifts are desirable; but special emphasis
is placed upon prophesying (1 Cor. 14: 1), which must not
be despised (1 Thess. 5: 20). Prophesying is for a sign to
believers (1, Cor. 14: 22, last clause), and for building up the
church (verse 3). Tongues are for a sign to unbelievers
 (verse 22, first clause), and require interpretation in order
that the church may be benefited (verses 13, 28). In the
 exercise of the gifts, care should be taken to avoid confusion.
 Verses 33, 40.
    4. As the Comforter is to abide with the church (John 14:
16), so just in the measure that the Comforter is in the mem-
 bers ought the gifts of the Comforter to be manifested.

                            Notes
                           THE NEED OF THE GIFTS
    1. "The gifts of the Spirit should all have their proper places. The
Bible is an everlasting rock. It is our rule of faith and practice. In it the
man of God is 'thoroughly furnished unto all good works.' If every member
of the church of Christ were holy, harmless, and separate from sinners, and
searched the Holy Scriptures diligently and with much prayer for duty, with
the aid of the Holy Spirit, we think, they would be able to learn their whole
duty in 'all good works.' Thus 'the man of God may be perfect.' But as
the reverse exists, and ever has existed, God in much mercy has pitied the
weakness of His people, and has set the gifts in the gospel church to correct
our errors, and to lead us to His living Word. Paul says that they are for
the 'perfecting of the saints,' till we all come in the unity of the faith.'
The extreme necessity of the church in its imperfect state is God's oppor-
tunity to manifest the Spirit."-James White, in the "Review and Herald,"
October 3, 1834.
                       THE CONTINUANCE OF THE GIFTS
    2. "When the design of the gifts is clearly seen, then the importance of
this subject will be understood. They were given for the perfectihig of the
              SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                              25

church of Christ. When the apostolic church was pure and holy, having
just learned the gospel from the great Head of the church, and having been
baptized with the Holy Ghost on the Day of Pentecost, the gifts of the Spirit
were given t,T them, for their edification and profit. And we have no Scrip-
ture evidence that they were designed for a limited portion of the gospel age,
to be taken away from the church in a few years; but the proof is abun-
dant that they were designed to- exist in the church as long as the saints
in their mortal state needed the teaching of the Bible and the Holy Spirit.
    "It is universally admitted that a portion of the gifts exist in the church
at this day, such as 'the word of wisdom,' and 'the word of knowledge,' and
no one denies that 'pastors' and 'teachers' were to be in the church until its
Perfection. Then if a portion of the gifts were to remain in the church,
why not all of them remain? Why should the professed church of Christ
pick out from that catalogue of gifts, so freely bestowed by.the great Head
of the church, those that suit them best, and trample the others in the dust?
It is sometimes asserted, by those who oppose the operations of the Spirit
of God, that the gifts were designed for the apostles alone.: but if this is
true, then the church of Christ has been destitute of 'the word of wisdom,'
'the word of knowledge,' and the gift of 'faith,' for about 1,800 years, and
those who have professed to be 'teachers' and 'pastors' have assumed a
calling which ceased to exist at the death of the apostles. It is therefore
very evident that all the gifts run parallel with each other, none of them
ending before the rest, and that they were to extend quite through the
gospel age.
    "The gifts were given for 'the perfecting of the saints,' and as the
church is in an imperfect state, they are all needed. They were to be em-
 ployed for this purpose 'till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of
 the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a .perfect man, unto the measure of
 the stature of the fullness of Christ.' The church has never yet reached
 this state of unity, knowledge, fullness and perfection: therefore the gifts
 should not be dismissed, until' the object for which they were given is
gained."— Ibid.

                           Synopsis
    SEED THOUGHT : "The church, whiCh is His body." Eph.
1: 22, 23.
    1. In the tabernacle in the wilderness, God manifested
His presence among His people. (Ex. 25: 8), and there His
glory was seen (Ex. 40: 34). When the permanent temple
took the place of the tabernacle, the same glory was then seen
in it. 1 Kings 8: 10, 11. In this way was foreshadowed the
manifestation of the glory of God in the person of His Son
 (John 1: 14), who spoke of His body as a temple ('John 2: 21).
2r6        SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

A body was prepared for the Son of God (Heb. 10: 5), in order
that He might minister to the needs of humanity (Heb. 2: 17).
    2. The body of Christ was composed of the same flesh and
blood as ours (verse 14), and He was subjected to the same
temptations as we are (Heb. 4: 15) ; yet He did not commit
sin (1 Peter 2: 22), but did the will of His Father (John 6:
38; Heb. 10: 7). This result was accomplished through the
indwellin4 of another, the Father. John 14: 10.
    3. This union of divinity and humanity in the -person of
Jesus is the rock foundation upon which, He declared, He
would build His church. Matt. 16: 16-18. When He was
about to withdraw His individual body from the world, He
promised His disciples that He would be with them always
 (Matt. 28: 20) ; and this promise was fulfilled through the
coming of the Comforter, His own indwelling presence (John
14: 18-20). Thus did the church become His collective body,
of which He is the head. Eph. 1: 22, 23. Although there are
many members, there is but one body (Rom. 12: 4, 5), and that
body is Christ's body (1 Cor. 12: 27). So intimate is the
union between Christ and His collective body, the church, that
it bears His name (verse 12), and is designed to be the light
of the world (Matt. 5: 14), even as He was the light of the
world (John 8: 12). Because of this intimate union, those
who were added to the church were said to be added to the
Lord (Acts 5: 14) ; and when Saul persecuted the saints,
Jesus declared that he was persecuting Him (Acts 9: 4, 5).
For the same reason, those who minister to the saints are said
to minister to Jesus Himself. Matt. 25: 37-40.

                                  Notes
                   CHRIST MANIFESTED THROUGH HIS BODY
    1. "The glorified Christ manifested Himself to man through His body.
If there is a perfect correspondence between Himself and His members,
then there will be a true manifestation of Himself to the world."—"The
Ministry of the Spirit" (El.. J. Gordon), p. 68.
                       THE SPIRIT THE LIFE OF THE BODY
   2. "The Spirit is the breath of God in the body of His church. While
that divine body survives and must, multitudes of churches have so shut out
the Spirit from rule and authority and supremacy in the midst of them that
the ascended Lord can only say to them: 'Thou hast a name to live and art
dead.' ''— Id., p. 146.
                    THE CHURCH AN AGENCY FOR SALVATION
   3. "The church of Christ is God's appointed agency for the salvation of
men. Its mission is to carry the gospel to the world. And the obligation
rests upon all Christians. Every one, to the extent of his talent and oppor-
tunity, is to fulfill the Saviour's commission. The love of Christ, revealed
to us, makes us debtors to all who know Him not. God has given us light,
not for ourselves alone, but to shed upon them."—"Steps to Christ," p. 85.
old edition; p. 102, new edition.
                    THE CHURCH A LIGHT IN THE WORLD
   4. "God has called His church in this day, as He called ancient Israel, to
stand as a light in the earth. By the mighty cleaver of truth, the messages
of the first, second, and third angels, He has separated them from the
churches and from the world to bring them into a sacred nearness to Him-
self. He has made them the depositaries of His law, and has committed
to them the great truths of prophecy for this time. Like the holy oracles
committed to ancient Israel, these are a sacred trust to be communicated to
the world.... Nothing is to be permitted to hinder this work. It is the all-
important work - for time; it is to be far-reaching as eternity. The love
that Jesus manifested for the souls of men in the sacrifice which He made
for their redemption, will actuate all His followers."—"Testimonies for the
Church," volume 5, pp. 455, 456.

                            Synopsis
    SEED THOUGHT: "Christ has made provision that His
church shall be a transformed body, illumined with the light
of heaven, possessing the glory of Immanuel."—"Testimonies
 for the Church," volume 8, p. 19.
    1. The union of husband and wife in which they "become
one flesh," answers to the union between Christ and the
church (Eph. 5: 28, 29) ; and therein is revealed the mystery
of godliness (verse 32; 1 Tim. 3: 16). As a common life
forms the living union between the head and the body of a
human being, so there is a living union between Christ's body,
the church, and Himself as the head, and the growth of the
body depends upon this connection. Eph. 4: 15, 16.
    2. As the character of God was revealed through Christ
when He was here in His individual body (John 1: 18), so
the wisdom of God is to be revealed through the church, the
collective body of Christ (Eph. 3: 10). As Christ was ap-
pointed to be for salvation to the people (Isa. 49: 6), so are
His followers to be the same (Acts 13: 47), and they are to
beseech men in Christ's stead (2 Cor. 5: 20).
    3. Christ indicated the kind of union which exists between
Him and true *believers, by His discourse concerning the vine
and the branches. The branch bears fruit because it abides
in the vine and receives a constant supply of life from it.
John 15: 4. So those who abide in Christ and are constantly
receiving the life-giving Spirit from Him, will bring forth
fruit; but without this connection, there is no fruit-bearing.
Verse 5. Fruit-bearing is the condition of life (verse 2) ;
and through Christ, life is supplied abundantly (John 10: 10),
so that God may be glorified by abundant fruit-bearing (John
15: 8).
    4. When this vital union between Christ and His body, the
church, is maintained, the decisions of the church, being made
in harmony with the counsel of the Holy Spirit, the Comforter
 (Acts 15: 28), are recognized in heaven (Matt. 18: 15-18),
even when they deal with the forgiveness of sins (John
20: 22, 23).
             SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                           29
    5. Christ gave Himself for the church (Eph. 5: 25), that
He might sanctify and cleanse it (verse 26); that He might
have a glorious church, holy and without blemish (verse 27).
                          Questions
    1. What answers to the union between Christ and the
church? Eph. 5: 28, 29.
    2. What is revealed in this union? Verse 32; 1 Tim. 3: 16.
    3. Upon what does the growth of Christ's body, the church,
depend? Eph. 4: 15, 16.
    4. What was revealed through the individual body of
Christ? John 1: 18.
    5. What is revealed through the collective body of Christ,
the church? Eph. 3: 10.
    6. What was Christ appointed to be to all peoples?
Isa. 49: 6.
    7. How are believers identified with Christ in respect to
this appointment? Acts 13: 47.
    8. In whose place do believers stand when they beseech
men? 2 Cor. 5:.20.
    9: In what discourse did Christ indicate the kind of union
which exists between Him and true believers? See synopsis,
 paragraph 3.
   10. What enables the branch to bear fruit? John 15: 4.
   11. What will be the experience of those who abide in
Christ? Verse 5.
   12. What is the condition of life? Verse 2.
   13. What does Christ abundantly supply? John 10: 10.
   14. By what use of this life is God to be glorified? John
15:8.
   15. When this union exists between Christ and His body,
 who is the counselor in the church? Acts 15: 28.
   16. Where are the decisions of the church then recognized?
 Matt. 18: 15-18.
   17. To what extent does this apply? John 20: 22, 23.
   18. For what did Christ give Himself? Eph. 5: 25.
   19. For what purpose did He do this? Verse 26.
   20. What kind of church would He thus have? Verse 27.
                              Notes
                        THE OFFICE OF THE CHURCH
   1. "The church of Christ is God's agency for the proclamation of truth :
she is empowered by Him to do a special work ; and if she is loyal to God,
obedient to His commandments, there will dwell within her the excellence of
divine power. If she will honor the Lord God of Israel, there is no power
that can stand against her."-"Testimonies for the Church," volume 8, p. 11.
                      THE AUTHORITY OF THE CHURCH
   2. "No church officer should advise, no committee should recommend, nor
should any church vote, that the name of a wrongdoer shall be removed
from the church books, until the instruction given by Christ has been faith-
30             SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

 fully followed. When this instruction has been followed, the church has
 cleared herself before God. The evil must then be made to appear as it is,
 and must be removed, that it may not become more and more widespread.
 The health and purity of the church must be preserved, that she may stand
 before God unsullied, clad in the robes of Christ's righteousness.
    "If the erring one repents and submits to Christ's discipline, he is to be
given another trial. And even if he does not repent, even if he stands out-
side the church, God's servants still have a work to do for him. They are
 to seek earnestly to win him to repentance. And, however aggravated may
have been his offense, if he yields to the striving of the Holy Spirit, and, by
confessing and forsaking his sin, gives evidence of repentance, he.is to be
forgiven and welcomed to the fold again. His brethren are to encourage
him in the right way, treating him as they would wish to be treated were
they in his place, considering themselves, lest they also be tempted.
    "'Verily I say unto you,' Christ continued, 'whatsoever ye shall bind on
earth shall be bound in heaven ; and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall
be loosed in heaven.' Matt. 18:18.
    "This statement holds its force in all ages. On the church has been con-
ferred the power to act in Christ's stead. It is God's instrumentality for
the preservation of order and discipline among His people. To it the Lord
has delegated the power to settle all questions respecting its prosperity,
purity, and order. Upon it rests the responsibility of excluding from its
fellowship those who are unworthy, who by their unchristlike conduct would
bring dishonor on the truth. Whatever the church does that is in accordance
with the directions given in God's Word will be ratified in heaven!— Id.,
volume 7, pp. 262, 263.
    "Let the repentance of the sinner be accepted by the church with grate-
ful hearts. Let the repenting one be led out from the darkness of unbelief.
into the light of faith and righteousness. Let his trembling hand be placed
in the loving hand of Jesus. Such a remission is ratified in heaven.
    "Only in this sense has the church power to absolve the sinner. Remis-
sion of sins can be obtained only through the merits of Christ. To no man,
to no body of men, is given power to free the soul from guilt. Christ
charged His disciples to preach the remission of sins in His name among
all nations ; but they themselves were not empowered to remove one stain
of sin. The name of Jesus is the only 'name under heaven given among
men, whereby we must be saved.' "—"The Desire of Ages," p. 806.

     SEED THOUGHT:   "As faith contemplates our Lord's great
sacrifice, the soul assimilates the spiritual life of Christ."—
"The Desire of Ages," p. 661.
   1. In the typical service, the priest ate the sin offering in
the holy place (Lev. 6: 24-26), thus foreshadowing a most
             SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   31

  important gospel truth. In His interpretation of the feeding
  of the multitude, Jesus declared that He was the bread of life
   (John 6: 48), and He identified this living bread with. His
  flesh given "for the life of the world" (verse 51). That in-
- tirnate fellowship with Christ which is represented by eating
  His flesh and drinking His blood is necessary in order to have
  life (verse 53), and this means mutual communion (verse 56).
       2. With a boldness of speech which repelled those who
  failed to catch His real meaning, Jesus spoke of those who
  would live by eating Him (verse 57), and set forth the dif-
  ference between the manna in the wilderness and the true
  bread from heaven (verse 58). By a comparison of verse 58
  with verse '47, it becomes evident that the bread from heaven
  is appropriated for spiritual life by believing, and this is done
   by receiving the words . of life. Verses 63, 68.
       3. When Jesus instituted the Lord's Supper (Matt. 26:
  26), He put into permanent form the instruction which He
   had given concerning Himself as the bread of life. What
   bread is for physical life, that Christ is for spiritual life.
   Breaking and eating the bread of the supper set forth such
   an identification of the believer with Christ and the sacrifice
   of Himself for sin as makes the life of Christ the life of the
   believer. 1 Cor. 10: 16, last clause. It is through His death
   that the life of Christ becomes available for us; and therefore
   in partaking of the Lord's Supper, we show forth His death.
  1 Cor. 11: 26.        •
       4. The great purpose of the gospel is to secure fellowship
   with God through Christ (1 John 1: 3), and into this fellow-
   ship we have been called (1 Cor 1: 6). The ordinances of the
   Lord's house are the outward expression of this spiritual
   fellowship.
                               Questions
       1. What did the priest do with the sin offering in the
   typical service? Lev. 6: 24-26.
       2. What did Jesus declare Himself to be? John 6: 48.
       3. What connection did He make between the living bread
   and His flesh? Verse 51.
       4. What is necessary in order to have life? Verse 53.
        5. What experience is thus set forth? Verse 56.
        6. How does the Christian maintain life? Verse 57.
        7. What notable difference is there between eating the
    manna and eating the true bread? Verse 58.
       8. How is the bread from heaven appropriated for spirit-
    ual life? Verses 58, 47.
        9. What is thus received? Verses 63, 68.
      10. In what statement did Jesus institute the Lord's Sup-
    per? Matt. 26:26.
32            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

  11. What instruction did He thus put into permanent form?,,
See synopsis, paragraph 3, first part.
  12. What comparison is there between ordinary bread and
the bread of life? See synopsis, paragraph 3.
  13. What does breaking and eating the bread of the Lord's
Supper set forth? 1 Cor. 10: 16; last clause.
  14. What do we show forth in the supper? 1 Cor. 11: 26.
Why?
  15. What is the great purpose of the gospel? 1 John 1: 3.
  16. Into what have we been called? 1 Cor. 1: 9.
  17. What constitutes the outward expression of this fellow-
ship? See synopsis, paragraph 4, last part.
                                  Notes
                    A LIVING CONNECTION WITH CHRIST
   1. "As faith contemplates our Lord's great sacrifice, the soul assimilates
the spiritual life of Christ. That soul will receive spiritual strength from
every communion. The service forms a living connection by which the be-
liever is bound up with Christ, and thus bound up with the Father. In a spe-
cial sense it forms a connection between dependent human beings and God.
   "As we receive the bread and wine symbolizing Christ's broken body and
spilled blood, we in imagination join in the scene of communion in the
upper chamber. We seem to be passing through the garden consecrated by
the agony of Him who bore the sins of the world. We witness the struggle
by which our reconciliation with God was obtained. Christ is set forth
crucified among us.
   "Looking upon the crucified Redeemer, we more fully comprehend the
magnitude and meaning of the sacrifice made by the Majesty of heaven.
The plan of salvation is glorified before us, and the thought of Calvary
awakens living and sacred emotions in our hearts. Praise to God and the
Lamb will be in our hearts and on our lips; for pride and self-worship can-
not flourish in the soul that keeps fresh in memory the scenes of Calvary."—
"The Desire of Ages," p. 661.
                      UNION WITH GOD THROUGH CHRIST
     2. "The communion service points to Christ's second coming. It was
designed to keep this hope vivid in the minds of the disciples. Whenever
they met together to commemorate His death, they recounted how 'He took
the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;
for this is My blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the
remission of sins. But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this
fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in My
Father's kingdom.' In their tribulation they found comfort in the hope of
their Lord's return. Unspeakably precious to them was the thought, 'As
often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do show the Lord's death
till He come.'
     "These are the things we are never to forget. The love of Jesus, with
its constraining power, is to be kept fresh in our memory. Christ has in-
stituted this service that it may speak to our senses of the love of God that
has been expressed in our behalf. There can be no union between our souls
and God except through Christ. The union and love between brother and
brother must be cemented and rendered eternal by the love of Jesus. And
nothing less than the death of Christ could make His love efficacious for
us. It is only because of His death that we can look with joy to His second
coming. His sacrifice is the center of our hope. Upon this we must fix our
faith."— Id., pp. 659, 660.

                           Synopsis
    SEED THOUGHT: "Our growth in grace, our joy, our use-
fulness,— all depend upon our union with Christ."--"Steps
to Christ," p.. 73.
    1. The gospel of our salvation is consummated in and
through Christ. When He became the Son of man, the last
Adam (1 Cor. 15: 45), He was not simply an individual man,
but a universal Person, the -head of a new humanity, in whom
the whole human family was again included, as it was in the
first Adam. What He *did was done by Him as the repre-
sentative of humanity, and we share in it through our union
with Him. Therefore in the epistles, the members of the
churches are called "the saints in Christ Jesus" (Phil. 1:1,
and similarly elsewhere), and they are "sanctified in Christ"
 (1 Cor. 1: 2), and are. "rooted and built up" in Christ
 (Col. 2 : 7).
    2. The believer's manner of life is "in Christ" (1 Peter
3: 16, A. R. V.), and he walks in Christ (Col. 2: 6), and his
greatest desire is to be found in Christ (Phil. 3: 9), since he
is "perfect in Christ" (Col. 1: 28).
    3. Althbugh there are many saints, yet they are one body
"in Christ" (Rom. 12: 5), they triumph in Christ (2 Cor. 2:
14), they fall asleep in Christ (1 Cor. 15: 18), and they are
 made alive in Christ (verse 22).
     4. There is no condemnation to those who are "in Christ"
 (Rom. 8: 1), for they are new creatures in Christ (2 Cor.
5: 17), created in Christ (Eph. 2: 10) Believers are chosen
34            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

in Christ (Eph. 1: 4), and all spiritual blessings are bestowed
in Christ (verse 3). In Christ we have forgiveness (verse 7),
and in Him we are sealed (verse 13).
    5. Apart from Christ, we can do nothing (John 15: 5) ;
but in Him, we can do all things (Phil. 4: 13, A. R. V.). Sin
has made a separation between us and God (Isa. 59: 2), but
we are made nigh in Christ (Eph. 2 : 13).
    6. These and other scriptures emphasize the great truth
that "Christ is all" (Col. 3: 11), and that union with Him is-
the essential thing in Christian experience.
                           Questions
    1. What name indicates the relation of Christ as the Son
of man to the human family? 1 Cor. 15: 45.

                             Notes
                                  IN CHRIST
   1. "In Christ dying, risen, reigning, God the Father has raised believing
men to a new heavenly life. From the first inception of the work of grace
to its consummation, God thinks of men, speaks to them and deals with
them in ehrist."--."The Expositor's Bible" (Ephesians), p. 25.
              SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                              35
                          IN HIM No CONDEMNATION
    2. "Do not wait to feel that you are made whole, but say, 'I believe it;
it is so, not because I feel it, but because God has promised.' . . . It is the
will of God to cleanse us from sin, to make us His children, and to enable
us to live a holy life. So we may ask for these blessings, and believe that
we receive them, and thank God that we have received them. It is our
privilege to go to Jesus and be cleansed, and to stand before the law with-
out shame or remorse. 'There is therefore now no condemnation to them
which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the
Spirit.' "—"Steps to Christ," pp. 55, 56, old edition; pp. 68, 64. new edition.
                              ABIDING IN HIM
   3. "Many have an idea that they must do someopart of the work alone.
They hava trusted in Christ for the forgiveness of sin, but now they seek
by their own efforts to live aright. But every such effort must fail. Jesus
says, 'Without Me ye can do nothing.' Our growth in grace, our joy, our
usefulness,— all depend upon our union with. Christ. It is by communion

    4. "In Christ's name His followers are to stand before God. Through
the value of the sacrifice made for them, they are of value in the Lord's
sight. Because of the imputed righteousness of Christ they are accounted
precious. For Christ's sake the Lord pardons those that fear Him. He
does not see in them the vileness of the sinner. He recognizes in them the
likeness of His Son in whom they believe."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 667.
