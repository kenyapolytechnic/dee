this quarter, you should read "Prophets and Kings,"
by Mrs. E. G. White. The "Seed Thoughts" at the be-
ginning of the lessons will mean more to you if you
read the entire chapters from which they are taken.
   The book abounds in great character studies—
Solomon the wise; Jeroboam, the man of policy; the,
mighty Elijah; Elisha the prophet; Ahaz, Hezekiah,
Nebuchadnezzar, Daniel, Jeremiah, and others. Be-
yond them all rises Christ, the only-begotten of God,
in whom all types of sacrifice, righteousness, and
peace find eternal fulfillment.
  The object of this volume is to point out the moral
lessons to be learned from Israel's experiences.

                            Synopsis
    SEED THOUGHT: "The very title 'Christ' or 'Messiah' sug-
gests kingship. . . . Admission into the kingdom or exclusion
from it depends upon men's attitude toward Him."—"The
International Standard Biblical Encyclopedia," page 1802.
    1. By being created in the image of God, Adam, the rep-
resentative of the human family, was invested with the royal
dignity to such an extent that he was able to exercise dominion
over the earth. Gen. 1: 26. His crown was not a material
one composed of precious metals and gems, but the glory of
the divine nature. Ps. 8: 4, 5. When by deliberate choice he
allied himself with the will of Satan, the great rebel, and thus
placed himself in opposition to the will of God, he separated
himself from God (Isa. 59: 2), and lost the divine nature
which enabled him to be a king (Rom. 3: 23). The gospel is
the good tidings of the restoration of the lost glory (1 Tim.
1: 11, A. R. V., margin), and of the divine nature (2 Peter
1: 4), and the consequent restoration of the crown (1 Peter
5: 4), and of the dominion (Dan. 7:27).
    2. Separation from God means to be "alienated from the
life of God" (Eph. 4: 17, 18), and to be accounted as dead
 (Eph. 2: 1). The restoration of the dominion therefore in-
volves the restoration to fellowship with God (1 John 1: 3),
the fountain of life (Ps. 36: 9), and the giver of life (Acts
17: 25), through His Son (1 John 5: 11, 12), and so the new
birth is the primary condition of entrance into the kingdom
 (John 3: 3, 5).
    3. The Son of God partook of our human nature (Rom.
8: 3), and became the second man (1 Cor. 15: 47), the last
Adam (verse 45), the head and representative of a new
humanity, through whom the life lost in the first Adam is
restored to us' (John 10: 10), and to this second man is given
the headship which was originally possessed by the first Adam
 (Eph. 1: 10, A. R. V.). As the Son of man, He will receive
4          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

the kingdom, as foretold by the prophet Daniel (Dan. /: 13,
14), when He comes in His glory (Matt. 25: 31).
     4. Those who abandon all hope of receiving the dominion
through their natural birth and their descent from the first
Adam (John 3: 6; Rom. 7: 18; 1 Cor. 15: 50), and are willing
to sacrifice everything else in order that they may be found in
Christ (Phil. 3: 8, 9), will overcome the world through Christ
 (Phil. 4: 13; 1 John 5: 4), and will share the dominion with
Him (Rev. 3: 21), because they are one with Him (John 17:
20, 21, A. R. V.), and confess Him as their Lord (John 13:13).
Thus the dominion is restored to Christ as the Son of man,
and through Him to all who are in vital union with Him.
                             Questions
    1. What dignity and what high privilege were bestowed •
upon Adam, the representative man, in his creation? Gen.
1: 26.

    7. What does separation from God mean? Eph. 4: 17, 18.

                                   Notes
                  THE KEY AND THE DOOR TO THE KINGDOM
    1. "Jesus is Himself the Key and the Door to the kingdom. Men enter
it by entering into relations with Himself. It is by repentance, forgiveness,
and faith, and in regard to all these His action is crucial, and His authority
supreme."—"Aspects of Christ," page 156.
                         THE KINGDOM RESTORED
    2. "At his creation, Adam was placed in dominion over the earth. But
by yielding to temptation, he was brought under the power of Satan. 'Of
whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.' When
man became Satan's captive, the dominion which he held, passed to his
conqueror. Thus Satan became 'the god of this world.' He had usurped that
dominion over the earth which had been originally given to Adam. But
Christ, by His sacrifice paying the penalty of sin, would not only redeem
man, but recover the dominion which he had forfeited. All that was lost by
the first Adam will be restored by the second. Says the prophet, '0 Tower
of the flock, the stronghold of the daughter of Zion, unto Thee, shall it come,
even the first dominion.' And the apostle Paul pointS forward to the 're-
demption of the purchased possession.' "—"Patriarchs and Prophets," page 67.

                            Synopsis
    SEED THOUGHT:    "The Bible plainly teaches that the prom-
ises made to Abraham are to be fulfilled through Christ.
All that are Christ's are 'Abraham's seed, and heirs accord-
ing to the promise.' "—"Patriarchs and Prophets," page 170.
   1. The gospel is the good news concerning the Son of
God (Rom. 1: 1, 3), and has been made known in the promises
announced through the prophets (verse 2). These promises
find their fulfillment in and through Christ (2 Cor. 1: 19, 20,
A. R. V.), who is Himself the Amen (Rey. 3:14). This
gospel was preached' to Abraham (Gal. 3: 8), when he was
called to leave all and to go out into an unknown land (Gen.
6          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

12: 1-3). The blessing of Abraham is realized only through
Christ. Gal. 3: 14.
    2. The first promise of the land, the territory of the re-
stored kingdom, was made, not to Abraham the individual,
but to the seed of Abraham (Gen. 12: 7), and this promise
became later the subject of an everlasting covenant (Gen.
15: 18). In the mind of God, "this land" included the world
 (Rom. 4: 13), • that is, the new earth, or the inheritance
 (Gal. 3: 18).
    3. According to the interpretation given by the Holy
Spirit, the seed of Abraham is Christ (Gal. 3: 16) ; and
therefore to Christ the 'new earth, or the inheritance, was
given. But the term "Christ" includes not simply the indi-
vidual seed of Abraham who was born in Bethlehem, but all
who are members of His body (1 Cor. 12: 27, 12), or the
collective seed, as they are "in Christ" (Rom. 12: 5). All
therefore who are finally found "in Christ" are Abraham's
seed, and will share in the inheritance promised to Christ.
Gal. 3 : 29.
    4. All our right to the possession of this world as origi-
nally given to the first Adam was forfeited through sin, and
passed over to Satan, whom Christ Himself recognized as
"the prince of the world" (John 14: 30, A. R. V.), and who
claimed proprietorship over it (Luke 4: 5, 6). Christ, to
whom the lost world was given by promise, came to seek
after it (Luke 19: 10), by casting out the usurper (John
12: 31, 32). We have reason to be of good cheer, because He
has conquered the world (John 16: 33), as our representative,
and we therefore may share in His victory.
    5. Even though the land of Canaan had been given to the
children of Israel by promise, it had to be taken from the
enemy who then possessed it (Joshua 1: 2-6) ; but it was the
Lord's host who entered upon this conquest (Joshua 5: 13, 14),
and their experience in taking Jericho showed the Lord's plan
that they should conquer by relying upon Him (Heb. 11: 30).
By the same faith and dependence upon God, we may conquer
the world (1 John 5: 4), and enter upon the possession of
the everlasting inheritance promised to Christ in the flesh,
the seed, and so to all who are found "in Christ."
                          Questions
   1. Who is the subject of the gospel? Rom. 1: 1, 3.
   2. How has the gospel been made known? Verse 2.
    3. In and through whom do those promises find their
fulfillment? 2 Cor. 1: 19, 20, A. R. V.
    4. What title by which Christ is known, indicates this?
Rev. 3: 14.

the seed of Abraham? Gal. 3: 29.
  15. How was our right to the possession of the world for-
feited? See synopsis, paragraph 4.
  16. To whom did this right pass over? and how was he rec-
ognized? John 14: 30, A. R. V.

  18. For what purpose did Christ come? Luke 19: 10.
  19. Whom did He cast out? John 12: 31, 32.
  20. For what reason did Christ urge His followers to be of
good cheer? John 16: 33.
  21. After the land was given to the children of Israel by
promise, what had they to do? Joshua 1: 2-6.
  22. Whose host went forth to conquer the promised land?
Joshua 5: 13, 14.
   23. By what means were they to conquer? Heb. 11: 30.
   24. By what means are we to conquer the world, and thus
gain the inheritance promised to us who are "in Christ"?
1 John 5: 4.
                            Notes
             ALL GOD'S PROMISES FULFILLED THROUGH CHRIST
    1. "The second truth covered and guarded by the conception of Jesus
as the Christ is this: that He is the person through whom God's kingdom
comes, and through whom all God's promises are fulfilled. . . . To borrow
the language of Paul, 'How many soever are the promises of God, in Him
is the Yea.' 2 Cor. 1: 20. They must be fulfilled in Him, or not at all:
or rather we should say, They have been fulfilled in Him, and in no other."
-"Jesus and the Gospel." pages 15, 16.
    2. "No promise of God has ever been given to man except through
Christ. Personal faith in Christ is the one thing necessary in order to
receive whatever God has promised."
               THE' SEED INCLUDES THOSE WHO ARE IN CHRIST
    3. "The seed of Abraham, to whom the promise was made, is Christ.
He is the heir. . . . Those who have been baptized into Christ have put
8             SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
on Christ, and are therefore one in Him. So when it is said that Christ is
the seed of Abraham, to whom the promises' were made, all who are in
Christ are included. But nothing outside of Christ is included in the promise.
To say that the inheritance promised to the seed of Abraham could be
possessed by any except those who were Christ's through faith in Him, is
to ignore the gospel, and to deny the word of God."

                             Synopsis
    SEED THOUGHT: "On the human side He [Christ] had the
title to the kingship as son of David, while on the divine side
as Son of God He had also the right to the throne."—"The
International Standard Bible Encyclopedia," page 1803.
    1. The first Adam was appointed as God's vicegerent to
have dominion over the earth, by virtue of being created
in the image of God. Gen. 1: 26. When he lost that image,
he lost the power to exercise the dominion. Yet the purpose
of God that man should rule the earth, was not to be thus
set aside; and the gospel provides for the restoration of the
image of God, and therefore the restoration of the dominion.
1 Cor. 15: 49; Rom. 8: 29. This involved the sending of the
Son of God, who is His image (Col. 1: 15), to become the
second man (1 Cor. 15: 47), the last Adam (verse 45).
    2. The purpose of God to restore man to his place as ruler
of the world was involved in the first gospel promise of one
to come who should bruise the head of the usurper. Gen. 3: 15.
The seed through whom this blessing would be realized was
later limited to the seed of Abraham (Gen. 12: 3), and to the
line of Isaac (Gen. 21: 12). After the people had demanded
a visible king (1 Sam. 8: 4, 5), and their demand had been
granted (verse 22), and David, who was definitely selected by
the Lord (1 Sam. 16: 11-13), was found to be a man after
God's own heart (Acts 13: 22), the Lord definitely promised
him that the throne and the kingdom of his seed should be
established forever (2 Sam. 7: 12, 13). This promise is
designated as a covenant based upon the oath of God (Ps.
89: 3, 4), to be fulfilled in a flesh and blood descendant of
David (Ps. 132: 11). The succession of day and night is the
pledge of its fulfillment. Jer. 33: 20, 21.
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  9

     3. The seed of David to whom the everlasting throne was
given by promise, was Jesu§ of Nazareth (Luke 1: 31-33),
who was of the seed of David (Rom. 1: 3). Those who were
familiar with the Scriptures knew that the promised Messiah
was the son of David (Matt. 22: 41, 42), and He was thus
acclaimed by the people (Matt. 21 :
     4. But the son of David was the Son of man, the last
Adam; and the throne and the kingdom were given to Him as
the representative of humanity. Dan. 7: 13, 14, 27. Those
who overcome will share the throne with Him (Rev. 3: 21),
and will reign "upon the earth" (Rev. 5:9, 10, A. R. V.) ,
through Christ (Rom. 5: 17, A. R. V.), "forever and ever"
 (Rev. 22: 5).

                             Notes
               THE PROMISES TO DAVID FULFILLED IN CHRIST
   1. "Glorious are the promises made to David and his house, promises
that look forward to the eternal ages, and find their complete fulfillment in
Christ."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," page 754.
                        THE SURE MERCIES OF DAVID'
   2. "The promise to David . .was not of any earthly and temporal,
                                   m—not of a changing and corruptible
but of a heavenly and eternal kingdo
throne, but of one that was unchanging and incorruptible. The sure mercies
of David, therefore, were mercies that could never perish or pass away ; not
such as could be handed on from sire to son, but such as would abide for-
ever in the person of that son who he believed had been promised to him,
and for whom so many generations and ages waited."—"Old Testament
Prophecy," pages 114, 115.
                             THE SON OF DAVID
   3. "After the analogy of earthly kingships it might be said that Jesus
Christ is a king by birth. He was born a king. His mother, like His
reputed father, 'was of the house and family of David.' Luke 2: 4. The
angel in announcing His birth declares that He will occupy the throne of
His father David. The Pharisees have no hesitation in affirming that the
Christ would be the Son of David. Matt. 22: 45 ; Mark 12: 35 ; Luke 20: 41.
Frequently in His life He was hailed as 'Son of David' ; and after His
ascension, Peter declares that the promise God had made to David that 'of
the fruit of his loins He would set one upon his throne' (Acts 2:30) was
fulfilled in Jesus of Nazareth."—"The International Standard Bible Ency-
clopedia," page 1805.

                         Synopsis
     SEED THOUGHT: "God's covenant with Abraham, being in
effect His covenant with mankind in Christ, stands both first
and last."—"The Expositor's Bible" (Galatians), page 205.
    1. The promise of the land (the world) to the seed of
Abraham (Christ), and the promise of an everlasting throne
to the seed of David (Christ), are the great promises of the
gospel. Their fulfillment involves the gift of Christ to take
our flesh, and His redemptive work in our behalf. A brief
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                11
study of the development and fulfillment of these promises
will therefore be of interest and profit.
   - 2. The covenant which was made with Abraham was estab-
lished with Isaac (Gen. 17: 21; 26: 3) ; and for Abraham's
sake, his seed was to be multiplied (Gen. 26: 24). The bless-
ing of Abraham, which included the promise of the land,
was bestowed by Isaac upon Jacob (Gen. 28: 3, 4), and re-
newed by Jehovah Himself (verses 13, 14) ; and just before
his death, Joseph assured his brethren in Egypt that God
would bring them into the land promised "to Abraham, to
Isaac, and to Jacob" (Gen. 50: 24).
    3. The covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob was re-
ferred to when God made Himself known as Jehovah, the
Redeemer (Ex. 6: 2-4) ; and His sevenfold promise of de-
liverance culminated in the promise to bring the children of
Israel into the land which He had sworn to give "to Abraham,
to Isaac, and to Jacob" (verses 6-8). The time of the so-
journ of the children of Israel was definitely stated to
Abraham (Gen. 15: 13, 14), and the fulfillment of this time
promise was mentioned by Stephen when he made his de-
fense before the council (Acts 7: 17).
     4. The promise to "Abraham, Isaac, and Israel [Jacob]"
was made the basis of Moses' plea in behalf of the people
after they had lapsed into idolatry in the wilderness. Ex.
32: 13. The psalmist began his review of the wonderful works
of the Lord in behalf of Israel by referring to .the covenant
with Abraham concerning the -land (Ps. 105: 8-11), and he
closed his review by another reference to the same promise
 (verse 42). Moses declared that it was because of the
oath of the Lord to their fathers that He brought them out
of Egypt. Deut. 7: 8. In the face of threatened trouble
on account of the apostasy of Judah, the prophet Micah gave
assurance that the Lord would perform the oath which He
swore to the fathers. Micah 7: 18-20.
     5. The prophet Isaiah used the then partial fulfillment
of the promised blessing upon Abraham as the basis of the
confidence that the Lord would comfort Zion. Isa. 51: 2, 3.
In view of the certainty of the fulfillment of the promise to
Abraham, John the Baptist warned the Jews of his day
against building their hope upon their being the literal seed
of Abraham, since God could fulfill the promise apart from
them (Matt. 3: 9) ; and Jesus Himself gave substantially the
same warning (Matt. 8: 10-12; Luke 13: 28). They that are
of faith are the children of Abraham (Gal. 3: 7), and will be
blessed with Abraham (verse 9).
     6. Zacharias recognized the advent of Christ, through
whom the promise was to be fulfilled, as due to the fact that
12         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

God remembered His covenant with Abraham. Luke 1: 72, 73.
Abraham was exalted to be the father of many nations
(Gen. 17: 5), with the promise of special divine favor to be
shown to him and his seed (verse 7), which would be in
number like the stars, and as the sand by the seashore (Gen.
15: 5; Heb. 11: 14. These promises are fulfilled through
Christ, the Son of Abraham. Matt. 1: 1.

                         Notes
                         THE PROMISE TO ABRAHAM
   1. "The covenant of grace was first made with man in Eden, when
after the fall, there was given a divine promise that the seed of the woman
should bruise the serpent's head. . . . This same covenant was renewed to
Abraham in the promise, 'In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be
blessed.' "—Patriarchs and Prophets," page 870.

                        ABRAHAM THROUGHOUT THE BIBLE
   ,2. "Abraham is a significant figure throughout the Bible. . . . 'The God
of Abraham' serves as a designation of Jehovah from the time of Isaac to
the latest period. . . .
    "When we pass to the New Testament we are astonished at-the wealth
and variety of allusion to Abraham. As in the Old Testament, his position
of ancestor lends him much of his significance, not only as ancestor of Israel
(Acts 13: 26), but specifically as ancestor, now of the Levitical priesthood
(Heb. 7: 5), now of the Messiah (Matt. 1: 1), now, by the peculiarly Chris-
tian doctrine of the unity of believers in Christ, of Christian believers (Gal.
3:16, 29). All that Abraham the ancestor received through divine election,
by the covenant made with him, is inherited by his seed, and passes under
the collective names of the promise (Rom. 4: 13), the blessing (Gal. 3: 14),
mercy (Luke 1:54), the oath (Luke 1:73), the covenant (Acts 3:25).
. . . It is his faith in the divine promise, which, just because it was for
him peculiarly unsupported by any evidence of the senses, becomes the type
of the faith which leads to justification (Rom. 4: 3), and there in this sense
again he is the 'father' of Christians, as believers (Rom. 4 : 11)."—"The
International Standard Bible Encyclopedia," page 21.

                             Synopsis
    SEED THOUGHT: "David reigned in the Lord's name, and
the.Lord, in the fullness of time, was born to occupy David's
throne."—"The Typology of Scripture," pages 121, 122.
    1. In the last lesson, we considered the development and
fulfillment of the promise to Abraham. In this lesson, we
shall study concerning the promise to David.          •
    2. The house of Saul, the first king of Israel, had passed
 (1 Chron. 10: 6), and the kingdom was turned to David
(verse 14); and the Lord promised to make him a house
(2 Sam. 7: 11, last clause), which would continue "for a
great while to come" (verse 19), even "forever" (verse 29).
    3. In his reign, David represented the character of ,God
(2 Sam. 8: 15; Ps. 103: 6); and he became a manifest type of
Christ and His eternal reign (Ezek. 34: 23, 24; 37: 24, 25;
Jer. 30: 8, 9). The throne of David was called "the throne
of the Lord" (1 Chron. 29: 23), and this throne was to be
established "forever" (2 Sam. 7: 16; Ps. 89: 34-36).
    4. When a conspiracy was made to overthrow the king who
sat on David's throne, and to put another in his place (Isa.
7: 5, 6), the prophet of the Lord foretold the birth of a son
who should sit on David's throne to establish it forever
(Isa. 9: 6, 7).
    5. In his prayer at the dedication of the temple, Solomon
referred to the covenant-promise to David (2 Chron. 6: 16) ;
and through the prophet Jeremiah, the Lord testified to the
absolute certainty of the fulfillment of this promise (Jer.
33: 19-21). The same prophet foretold the coming of "a
righteous Branch" who should "reign as king" (Jer. 23: 5,
A. R. V.), and his name, points plainly to Christ (verse 6).
    6. The angel Gabriel, in announcing the birth of Jesus,
declared that the throne of His father David would be given
to Him (Luke 1: 32, 33) ; and the people recognized Him as
the Son of David (Matt. 12: 23). Under the inspiration of
the Holy Spirit, Zacharias spoke of Christ as "a horn of
salvation" raised up in the house of David. Luke 1: 68, 69,
A. R. V. When Jesus made His entry into Jerusalem, He
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  15

was greeted with the cry, "Blessed is the kingdom that
cometh, the kingdom of our father David" (Mark 11: 9, 10,
A. R. V.) ; and after His ascension, Jesus spoke of Himself
as "the root and the offspring of David" (Rev. 22: 16).
    7. The psalmist recorded the promise that a direct de-
scendant of David should sit on his throne (Ps. 132: 11) ; and
on the Day of Pentecost, the apostle Peter used this promise
as the basis of belief in the resurrection of Christ, through
whom the promise was to be fulfilled (Acts 2: 29-31, 34-36).
The climax in the development and .fulfillment of these prom-
ises and prophecies will come in the days of the seventh angel.
Rev. 11: 15.
    8. From these scriptures, it is clear that the promise of
the everlasting throne to the seed of David (2 Sam. 7: 12, 13)
was to be fulfilled in Jesus Christ, the Son of David (Matt.
1: 1) ; and those who are- "in Christ" and endure, will reign
with Him (2 Tim. 2: 12).
                           Questions
    1. What happened to the house of Saul? 1 Chron. 10: 6.
    2. To whom was the kingdom of Israel turned? Verse 14.
' 3. What did the Lord promise to do for David? 2 Sam.
7: 11, last clause.
    4. How long would this house continue? Verses 19, 29.
    5. Whose character was represented in David's reign?
2 Sam. 8: 15; Ps. 103: 6.
   .6. What prophecies spoke of David in such a way as to
show that he was a type of Christ? Ezek. 34: 23, 24;
37: 24, 25; Jer. 30:8, 9.

29: 23.
    8. What is said' of the duration of this throne? 2 Sam.
7: 16; Ps. 89: 34-36.

in the days of Ahaz? Isa. 7: 5, 6.
   10. In connection with this event, what prophecy was
uttered? Isa. 9: 6, 7.                          •
   11. To what did Solomon refer in his prayer at the dedi-
cation of the temple? 2 Chron. 6: 16.

           SHEPHERDS WATCHED FOR THE KING TO DAVID'S THRONE
    1. "In the fields where the boy David had led his flock, shepherds were
still keeping watch by night. Through the silent hours they talked together
of the promised Saviour, and prayed for the coming of the King to David's
throne. . . . At these words [Luke 2: 8-14], visions of glory fill the minds
of the listening shepherds. The Deliverer has come to Israel ! Power, exal-
tation, triumph, are associated with His coming."—"The Desire of Ages,"
page 4l.
                          CHRIST ON DAVID'S THRONE.
    2. "The Pharisees had gathe1ed close about Jesus as He answered the
question of the scribe. Now turning He put a question to them: 'What
think ye of Christ? whose son is He?' This question was designed to test
their belief concerning the Messiah,—to show whether they regarded Him
simply as a man or as the Son of God. A chorus of voices answered, 'The
Son of David.' This was the title which prophecy had given to the Messiah.
When Jesus revealed His divinity by His mighty miracles, when He healed
the sick and raised the dead, the people had inquired among themselves, 'Is
not this the Son of David?' The Syro-Phenician woman, blind Bartimeus,
and many others had cried to Him for help, 'Have mercy on me, 0 Lord,
Thou Son of David.' While riding into Jerusalem He had been hailed with
the joyful shout, 'Hosanna to the Son of David ; blessed is He that cometh in
the name of the Lord.' And the little children in the temple had that day
echoed the glad ascription. But many who called Jesus the Son of David
did not recognize His divinity. They did not understand that the Son of
David was also the Son of God."—Id., pages 608, 609.

                             Synopsis
    SEED THOUGHT: "All prophecy ultimately relates to this
new King, the divine head of the Adamic race, and to His
kingdom; to His first coming and its militant period, to His
second coming and its triumphant period."—"The Scriptures
God's Living Oracles," page 28.
    1. The Lord Most High is infinite in greatness and power
and understanding (Ps. 147: 5), "possessor of heaven and
earth" (Gen. 14: 19), whose is the kingdom (1 Chron. 29: 11) ,
and He is "King of all the earth" (Ps. 47: 6, 7). It was His
plan that man should be His vicegerent in ruling this world.
Gen. 1: 26. Although sin .has for a time interfered with this
plan, yet the plan will be carried out.
    2. Inasmuch as the gospel' is the good news of the res-
toration of the kingdom of God, naturally prophecies concern-
ing the kingdom should occupy a large place in the Scriptures.
Some of these prophecies will now be studied. In a certain
sense, the Old Testament as a whole is one great prophecy,
in both its history of the chosen people, and its typical forms
of government and of worship, as well as in its direct predic-
tions; but we shall necessarily confine ourselves to an outline
of the more important predictions concerning the kingdom and
its restoration.
     3. Isaiah prophesied at a time when Assyria from the
north and Egypt from the south were threatening the king-
dom of Judah; and interspersed with his warnings against
an alliance with any foreign power, and his exhortations, to
 rely upon Jehovah (Isa. 50: 10), were prophecies of a 'glori-
ous time when the ideal kingdom should be established. This
would be accomplished through the agency of "a shoot out
of the stock of Jesse" (Isa. 11: 1, A. R. V.), who would judge
"with righteousness" (verse 4), and with faithfulness (verse
5). The knowledge of the Lord would fill the earth (verse 9),
 and the nations would seek to "the Root of Jesse" (verse
10). The nature of the kingdom is clearly indicated (Isa.
32: 1), and it corresponds with the description through the
18          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

 apostle Paul (Rom. 14: 17) . There is the promise of beholding
 a king of an unusual character (Isa. 33: 17) , who is plainly
 named as being Jehovah (verse 22, A. R. V.), the Holy One
 of Israel, and their Creator (Isa. 43: 15). An essential part
 of the new order of things will be "new heavens and a new
 earth" (Isa. 65: 17), for which we are still looking (2 Peter
3: 13).
     4. The action of the people in the days of Samuel, in re-
 jecting the Lord, that He should not be king over them, and in
 demanding an earthly king (1 Sam. 8: 1-7), was prophetic
 of the total rejection of their true King in favor of an earthly
 ruler (John 19: 15).
                             Questions
    1. What is revealed concerning the greatness and power
of the Lord? Ps. 147:5.
    2. Of what is He the possessor? Gen. 14: 19.
     3. What belongs to Him? 1 Chron. 29: 11.

     5. What was His plan for man? Gen. 1:26.
     6. What effect has sin had upon this plan? See synopsis,
paragraph 1.
     7. Why should we expect that prophecies concerning the
kingdom would occupy a large place in the Scriptures? See
synopsis, paragraph 2.
    8. What kingdoms were threatening Judah when Isaiah
prophesied? See synopsis, paragraph 3.
    9. Upon whom did he urge the people to rely? Isa. 50: 10.
   10. What were interspersed among his warnings and exhor-
tations? See synopsis, paragraph 3.

   12. What would be characteristic of His rule? Verses 4, 5.
   13. What would, fill the earth? Verse 9.

acter? Isa. 33: 17.

                         • THE CHRIST OF PROPHECY
    1. "Reports have reached the rulers in Jerusalem that Jesus is approach-
ing the city with a great concourse of people. But they have no welcome
for the Son of God. In fear they go out to meet Him, hoping to disperse
the throng. As the procession is about to descend the Mount of Olives, it is
intercepted by the rulers. They inquire the cause of the tumultuous re-
joicing. As they question, 'Who is this?' the disciples, filled with the spirit
of inspiration, answer this question. In eloquent strains they repeat the
prophecies concerning Christ :—
    "Adam will tell you, It is the seed of the woman that shall bruise the
serpent's head.
    "Ask Abraham, he will tell you, It is 'Melchizedek, King of Salem,' King
of peace.
    "Jacob will tell you, He is Shiloh of the tribe of Judah.
    "Isaiah will tell you, 'Immanuel,"Wonderful, Counselor, the mighty God,
the everlasting Father, the Prince of peace.'
    "Jeremiah will tell you, The Branch of David, 'the Lord our Righteous-
ness.'
    "Daniel will tell you, He is the Messiah.
    "Hosea will tell you, He is 'the Lord God of hosts ; the Lord is His
memorial.'
    "John the Baptist will tell you, He is 'the Lamb of God, which taketh
away the sin of the world.'
    "The great Jehovah has proclaimed from His throne, 'This is My be-
loved Son.'
    "We, His disciples, declare, This is Jesus, the Messiah, the Prince of
life, the Redeemer of the world.
    "And the prince of the poivers of darkness acknowledges Him, saying,
'I know Thee who Thou art, the Holy One of God.'"—"The Desire of Ages,"
 pages 578, 579.
                        THE DIVINE PROGRAM OF HISTORY
    2. "To trace the hand of God in history, to note how all the ages of His
providential government have moved according to a foreseen and foretold
order, to watch the last stages of the divine program of universal history
fulfilling themselves in our sight in these last days, to discern 'the signs of
the times,' and to observe the budding of the fig tree, is to find hope merg-
ing in definite expectation, and in patient waiting for Christ—a waiting
for Him as for one whose footfall may be already heard, one who even now
standeth at the door ; it is to lift up our heads, convinced that our redemp-
tion, our full redemption, the redemption of ,the body, and of the world
itself, draweth nigh."—"Light for the Last Days," page 18.           •
                         THE EVIDENCE OF PROPHECY
   •3. "After His resurrection, Jesus appeared to His disciples on the way
to Emmaus, and 'beginning at Moses and all the prophets, He expounded
unto them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself.' The hearts
of the disciples were stirred. Faith was kindled. They were 'begotten again
unto a lively hope,' even before Jesus revealed Himself to them. It was His
purpose to enlighten their understanding, and to fasten their faith upon
'the sure word of prophecy.' He wished the truth to take firm root in
their minds, not merely because it was supported by -His personal testimony,
but because of the unquestionable evidence presented by the symbols and
shadows of the typical law, and by the prophecies of the Old Testament."—

    SEED THOUGHT: "The waning power of Israel testified that
the Messiah's coming was at hand. The prophecy of Daniel
pictured the glory of His reign over an empire which should
succeed all earthly kingdoms; and, said the prophet, 'It shall
stand forever.' "—"The Desire of Ages," page 34-
    1. Although the Lord warned His people against making
any alliances with a worldly power (Isa. 30: 1, 2), yet Ahaz
 sought the help of Assyria (2 Chron. 28: 16), and Hoshea
turned to Egypt for assistance (2 Kings 17:4): As the
result of their evil course in this and other matters, Israel
was carried captive by Assyria (verses 6-18), and later
Judah was carried to Babylon (1 Chron. 9: 1, A. R. V.).
    2. After Jerusalem had been utterly destroyed (2 Chron.
36: 17-19), and there seemed to be no hope, from a human
standpoint, that the predictions of the prophets concerning
the future glory of the kingdom would ever be realized, the
Lord gave most definite assurances through the prophet Daniel
concerning the establishment of the everlasting kingdom.
God made known to Nebuchadnezzar, in his dream of the
great image, what would come to pass "in the latter days"
 (Dan. 2: 28) ; and in declaring the interpretation of this
dream, Daniel told him that the head of gold represented
the kingdom of Babylon (verses 37, 38), that a second and a
third kingdom would succeed his (verse 39), that a fourth
kingdom would follow (verse 40), and that this last kingdom
would be divided (verse 41). This brief outline of the history
of the world, covering many centuries of time, 'has found its
fulfillment in the four great universal kingdoms, Babylon,
Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome, including the division of
Rome into ten kingdoms. These were so many historical steps
leading up to the consummation of all human history—the
setting up of the everlasting kingdom of God. Verse 44.
    3. By His providential control of circumstances, the' God
of heaven so ordered the matter that the dream of Nebuchad-
nezzar and its interpretation not only announced that His
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  21

everlasting kingdom would follow the overthrow of all the
worldly kingdoms, but also indicated the reason for its in-
definite duration. The religion of Babylon did not contem-
plate that personal union between Deity and humanity (Dan.
2: 11) which was the glory of the true religion (Isa. 57: 15) ,.
and the wise men of Babylon consequently failed to establish
their claims when put to the test (Dan. 2: 10). Daniel and'
his companions depended upon that God who communes with.
men (verses 17, 18), and He did not fail them (verse 19)..
Daniel did not claim that the education which he had received
in Babylon enabled him to meet the king's demands (verse 30),
but acknowledged his dependence upon the God of heaven.
 (verse 28). And after Daniel had interpreted the dream,.
Nebuchadnezzar recognized the superiority of the God of
heaven, just because He could commune with men as He had
communed with Daniel in revealing to him the dream and its.
interpretation. Verse 47.                                        •

                                   Notes
                   THE CHRONOLOGY OF THE FOUR KINGDOMS
   1. The sovereignty of the world passed from Babylon to Medo-Persia in
538 B. C. ; from Medo-Persia to Greece in 331 s. c.; from Greece to Rome in
168 B. C. ; and the division of the Roman empire into ten kingdoms was
fully accomplished in 476 A. D. Some of these kingdoms can be readily
recognized among the kingdoms of modern Europe ; and they will continue
until the God of heaven sets up His everlasting kingdom, according to the
prediction , made through the prophet Daniel.
                         A PREPARATORY EXPERIENCE
    2. The loyalty of Daniel and his companions to the God of heaven, as re-
vealed in the experience recorded in the first chapter of Daniel, prepared
them for being the recipients of the revelation of the secret or mystery of
the kingdom of God.
                        THE GOSPEL OF THE KINGDOM
    3. The purpose of the book of Daniel is to proclaim the gospel of the
kingdom of God, and its final triumph over all opposing powers. The
organized opposition of the god of this world has been directed toward
making Babylon the mistress of the world,—first ancient Babylon, and
then modern Babylon,—enforcing
                         by         a false religion. In the interpretation
of Nebuchadnezzar's dream, only one verse is allotted to both Medo-Persia
and Greece, while much more attention is paid to the first and fourth king-
doms. The second and third kingdoms are mentioned simply in order to
make the historical and chronological connection between the two Babylons.
The real objective is the announcement of the fifth kingdom, the ever-
lasting kingdom of the God of heaven, as the outcome of the long continued
struggle for the control of the world.

                              ARE WE READY?
    4. "The coming kingdom.! This ought to be the all-absorbing topic with
the present generation. Reader, are you ready for the issue? He who enters
this kingdom enters it not merely for such a lifetime as men live in this
Present state, not to see it degenerate, not to see it overthrown by a suc-
ceeding and more powerful kingdom ; but he enters it to participate in all
its privileges and blessings, and to share its glories forever; for this king-
dom is not to 'be left to other people.' Again we ask you, Are you ready?
The terms of heirship are most liberal: 'If ye be Christ's, then are ye
Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.' Are you on terms of
friendship with Christ, the coming King? Do you love His character? Are
you trying to walk humbly in His footsteps, and obey His teachings?"—

   The great image of Nebuchadnezzar's dream, representing
as a whole the kingdom of man, and by the materials of which
it was composed, the course of empire. The kingdom of man
passes through five noted phases: Babylonian, the head of
gold ; Medo-Persian, breast and arms of silver ; Grecian, the
belly and thighs of brass ; imperial Rome, legs of iron ; and
growing democracy, causing the now broken condition of the
world, the feet of iron and clay, till the everlasting kingdom
of Christ, symbolized by the stone, is established upon their
ruins by the creative power of God.           •

                             Synopsis
• SEED THOUGHT: "And without controversy great is the
mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh."
1 Tim. 3: 16.                            •
    "The story. of Bethlehem is an exhaustless theme. In it
is hidden 'the( depth of the riches both of the wisdom and
knowledge of God. ""The Desire of Ages," page 48.
    "Our little world is the lesson book of the universe. God's
wonderful purpose of grace, the mystery of redeeming love,
is the theme into which 'angels desire to look.' "—Id., pages
19, 20.
    1. That which was revealed to Daniel is called a mystery,
or secret. Dan. 2: 19. In revealing this sdcret, or mystery,
to Nebuchadnezzar, Daniel foretold not only the rise -and fall
of earthly kingdoms as the result of the long struggle for the
supremacy of the world, but also the outcome in the setting
up of the kingdom of God, and the characteristic difference
between that kingdom and the kingdoms wlfich preceded it.
Verse 44. They would go down before it in utter 'destruction,
but it would have no end.
    2. The kingdom foretold by the prophet Daniel is the
everlasting kingdom spoken of by the apostle Peter (2 Peter,
1: 10, 11), and the heavenly kingdom looked forward to by
the apostle Paul (2 Tim. 4: 18). It was this kingdom con-
cerning which our Lord taught so often in parables, the
mystery of which He declared was revealed to His disciples-
Mark 4: 11. It is also called the mystery of the gospel
 (Eph. 6: 19), the mystery of God (Col. 2: 2), the mystery
of Christ (Eph. 3: 4), and the mystery of godliness (1 Tim.
3: 16, first clause). In experience, this mystery means that
union of divinity and humanity which is ministered to us
through an indwelling Christ. .Col. 1: 26, 27. This is the
kingdom of God "within you." Luke 17: 21..
    3. Christ is in His own person the eternal life manifested
in visible form (1 John 1: 2; 5: 20, last clause) ; and in His
twofold nature, He is Himself the mystery of godliness
 (1 Tim. 3: 16, first two clauses). To know Him as the Sent
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   25

of God is eternal life. John 17: 3. Those who are joined
to Him by a living faith, begin eternal life here. 1 John 5: 13.
    4. Christ is not only the manifested life, but He is also
the manifested righteousness (1 Cor. 1: 30), as is clearly
shown by one of His titles (Jer. 23: 5, 6) ; and because of
the eternity of His being, His righteousness is everlasting
(Ps. 119: 142). But the very nature of the kingdom is right-
eousness (Rom. 14: 17) ; and righteousness is the basis of
its authority (Heb. 1:.8), and the foundation of its rule
 (Ps. 89: 14, A. R. V.).
    5. By comparing Mark 9: 47 with Matt. 5: 8, it will be
seen that Jesus regarded "the kingdom of God" as equivalent
to "life"; and as the kingdom of God is fully identified
with the Son of God, an eternal kingdom is only one form of
the manifestation of the eternal life of the King, Jesus Christ.
The subjects of the kingdom who are in union with Him,
and who reveal their loyalty by doing His will as expressed
in His law (Ps. 40: 8), will share in His nature (2 Teter
1: 4), and abide forever (1 John 2:17).
    6. In his ability to make known to Nebuchadnezzar his
dream and its.interpretation, Daniel demonstrated the reality
of that personal fellowship with God which is the expression
of the mystery of godliness, and proclaimed in Babylon that
eternal life and righteousness which distinguished the kinx-
dom of God from any earthly kingdom, and which constitute
the explanation of its eternal duration.
                            Questions

    2. In revealing this secret, on mystery, to Nebuchadnez-

                             Note
                 CHRIST THE SECRET OF THE OLD TESTAMENT
    "In Christ the Eternal lodged His purpose and laid His plans for the
world. It is His fullness that the fullness of the times dispenses. The Old
Testament, the reservoir of previous revelation, had Him for its close-kept
secret, 'held in silence through eternal times.' Rom. 16: 25-27. The drift
of its prophecies, the focus of its converging lights, the veiled magnet to-
wards which its spiritual indications pointed, was 'Christ.' He 'was the
spiritual rock that followed' Israel in its wanderings, from whose springs
the people drank, as it answered to the touch of one and now another of the
holy men of old. The revelation of Jesus Christ gives unity, substance, and
meaning to the history of Israel, which is otherwise a pathway without
goal, a problem without solution. Priest and prophet, law and sacrifice;
the kingly Son of David, and the suffering Servant of Jehovah ; the Seed
of the woman, with bruised foot bruising the serpent's head ; the Lord whom
His people seek, suddenly coming to His temple the Stone hewn from the
mountains without hands, that grows till it fills the earth—the manifold
representations of Israel's ideal, center in the Lord Jesus Christ. The lines
of the great figure drawn on the canvas of prophecy—disconnected as they
seemed, and without a plan, .       . are filled out and drawn into shape and
take life and substance in Him."—"The Expositor's Bible" (Epheeians),

                            Synopsis
    SEED THOUGHT : "Under the rebuke of Him who is King of
kings and Lord of lords, Nebuchadnezzar had learned at last
the lesson which all rulers need to learn,—that true greatness
consists in true goodness."—"Prophets and Kings," page 521.
    1. In his interpretation of the dream of Nebuchadnezzar,
the prophet Daniel declared that Babylon would be succeeded
by three other universal kingdoms, but that the God of heaven
would then set up His everlasting kingdom. Dan. 2: 36-44.
This fifth kingdom would fill "the whole earth." Verse 35.
At first, Nebuchadnezzar seemed to accept this outline of the
future as authoritative (verse 47), and to concede the cor-
rectness of Isaiah's prophecy (Isa. 13: 19) ; but during the
next twenty years, the greatness of Babylon increased to
such an extent that he evidently concluded that his own king-
dom would be everlasting; and he expressed his view of world
history by setting up an image all of gold (Dan. 3: 1), in
contrast with the image of his dream, whose head only was of
gold (Dan. 2: 32).
     2. The representatives of a world dominion were sum-
moned to the dedication of this image (Dan. 3: 2), and were
commanded to acknowledge the supremacy of Babylon by
falling down before the image (verses 4, 5). To refuse to do
 so was to invite death. Verse 6. Three Jewish young men
 declined to do homage to this image. Verse 12. When a
second opportunity to obey the decree was given them, they
 remained loyal to the God of heaven (verses 16-18), and the
 threatened punishment was inflicted upon them (verse 21).
 But God miraculously delivered them (verses 24-27), and
 Nebuchadnezzar recognized their faithfulness to their God
  (verse 28) as the great deliverer (verse 29). This experience
 taught that although the God of heaven had made Nebuchad-
 nezzar a universal king (Dan. 2: 37, 38), God was still above
 him as ruler of the world (Ps. 103: 19), to whom alone
 worship was due (Deut. 6: 13).
28          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

    3. But a further experience was necessary in order to
enforce this lesson; for about twenty years later, we find
Nebuchadnezzar boasting of "great Babylon" and glorifying
himself. Dan. 4: 29, 30. Daniel's interpretation of the dream
of the lofty tree •was then fulfilled upon him (verses 31-33),
which led him personally to acknowledge the true God (verse
34), and to worship Him who had conquered his pride
(verse 37).
    4. Thus the gospel of the kingdom of God was preached in
Babylon in three messages, which resulted in the conversion
of the king of Babylon, and in a world-wide proclamation
concerning the everlasting kingdom of God. Verses 1-3.
                            Questions
     1. In his interpretation of the dream of the great image,
 what facts did Daniel set forth? Dan. 2: 36-44.

                            Notes
            NEBUCHADNEZZAR'S MISINTERPRETATION OF HIS DREAM
   1. "The symbolic representation by which God had revealed to king and
people His purpose for the nations of earth, was now to be made to serve
for the glorification of human power. Daniel's interpretation was to be
rejected and forgotten ; truth was to be misinterpreted and misapplied. The
symbol designed of Heaven to unfold to the minds of men important events
of the future, was to be used to hinder the spread of the knowledge that
God desired the world to receive,. Thus through the devisings of ambitious
men, Satan was seeking to thwitit the divine purpose for the human race."
—"Prophets and Kings," page 505.
                     THE LESSONS OF THE DELIVERANCE
   2. "By the deliverance of His faithful servants, the Lord declared that He
takes His stand with the oppressed, and rebukes all earthly powers that
rebel against the authority of Heaven. . .         .
    "Important are the lessons to be learned from the experience of the He-
brew youth on the plain of Dura. In this our day, many of God's servants,
though innocent of wrongdoing, will be given over to suffer humiliation and
abuse at the hands of those who, inspired by Satan, are filled with envy and
religious bigotry. Especially will the wrath of man be aroused against those
who hallow the Sabbath of the fourth commandment; and at last a uni-
versal decree will denounce these as deserving of death. The season of distress
before God's people will call for a faith that will not falter. His children
must make it manifest that He is the only object of their worship, and that
no consideration, not even that of life itself, can induce them to make the
least concession to false worship."—Id., pages 511, 512.
                       NEBUCHADNEZZAR'S CONVERSION
    3. "The once proud monarch [Nebuchadnezzar] had become a humble
child of God ; the tyrannical, overbearing ruler, a wise and compassionate
king. He who had defied and blasphemed the od of heaven, now acknowl-
edged the power of the Most High, and earnestly sought to promote the fear
of Jehovah and the happiness of His subjects. . . . God's purpose that the
greatest kingdom in the world 'should show forth His praise, was now ful-
filled. This public proclamation, in which Nebuchadnezzar acknowledged
the mercy and goodness and authority of God, was the last act of his life
recorded in sacred history."—Id., page 521.

                            Synopsis
     SEED THOUGHT:    "In that last night of mad folly, Bel-
shazzar and his lords had filled up the measure of their guilt
and the guilt of the Chaldean kingdom. No longer could God's
restraining 'hand ward off the irspending evil."—"Prophets
and Kings," page 530.
    1. The successors of Nebuchadnezzar in the kingdom of
Babylon disregarded the lessons which he had learned, and
oppressed the people of God who were in captivity, according
to the prophecy of Isaiah. Isa. 47: 6. Their defiance of the
God of heaven came to a climax in the time of Belshazzar
when he openly insulted Him by using the sacred vessels
from the temple in 'Jerusalem at an idolatrous feast. Dan.
5: 1-4. But while the feast was at its height, the hand of
an unseen being traced some words upon the wall of the
palace (verse 5), which greatly terrified the king of Babylon
 (verse 6), and led him to call upon the wise men of Babylon
to read the writing to him (verse 7). Their failure' and the
king's distress of mind attracted the attention of the queen,
who told him of Daniel, and his ability to deal with such mat-
ters, as shown in the reign of Nebuchadnezzar. Verses 10-12.
    2. Although nearly seventy years had passed since Daniel
had demonstrated his fellowship with God by the revelation
made to him, yet the memory of that remarkable experience
still lived (verses 13, 14), and he was asked to read the
writing on the wall and to make known its interpretation
 (verse 16). Daniel first reminded Belshazzar that the great-
ness of Babylon, achieved by Nebuchadnezzar, was wholly
due to the Most High God (verses 18, 19), and that on ac-
count of his pride of heart, Nebuchadnezzar lost for a time
his throne and his glory (verse 20), in order that he might
learn to recognize the Most High God as over all earthly
kingdoms (verse 21).
    3. Belshazzar, as Daniel affirmed, refused to be governed
by the principles accepted by Nebuchadnezzar (verse 22), but
exalted himself against the Lord of heaven, and gave to idols
the glory due to God (verse 23). Then three disconnected
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                 31

words were inscribed on the wall (verse 25), which Daniel
interpreted into three complete sentences. The first announced
the overthrow of the kingdom of Babylon (verse 26), the
second was a personal estimate of the character of Belshazzar
(verse 27), and the third designated his successors in the
world supremacy (verse 28). On that very night, the king-
dom of Babylon and her king both ceased to be. Verses 30, 31.
    4. The three messages to Babylon proclaimed God as the
supreme ruler and the only object of worship. This is the
everlasting gospel which is being preached to Babylon to-day
 (Rev. 14: 6, 7), the gospel of God's righteousness, accepted
by believing (Rom. 1: 16, 17). The distinguishing character-
istic of Babylon was pride (Jer. 50: 29-32), which is the
evidence of the lack of that righteousness which is recered
as a gift from God by faith (Hab. 2: 4). It was the re-
jection of the gospel of the kingdom of God, the threefold
message of righteousness by faith, which caused the fall of
Babylon. Dan. 5: 22-24.
                           Questions
    1. How did the successors of Nebuchadnezzar in the
kingdom of Babylon show that they disregarded the lessons
taught to Nebuchadnezzar? Isa. 47: 6.

                         THE PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY
    "Every nation that has come upon the stage of action has been permitted
to occupy its place on the earth, that the fact might be determined whether
it would fulfill the purposes of the Watcher and the Holy One. Prophecy
has traced the rise and progress of the world's great empires,—Babylon,
Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome. With each of these, as with the nations of
less power, history has repeated itself. Each has had its period of test ;
each has failed, its glory faded, its power departed.. While nations have re-
jected God's principles, and in this rejection have wrought their own ruin,
yet a divine, overruling purpose has manifestly been at work throughout
the ages. .    .
    "The history of nations speaks to us to-day. To every nation and to
every individual God has assigned a place in His great plan: To-day men
and nations are being tested by the plummet in the hand of Him who makes
no mistake. All are by their own choice deciding_their destiny, and God is
overruling all for the accomplishment of His purposes."—"Prophets and
Kings," pages 535, 536.

                              Synopsis
    SEED THOUGHT: ."She is called 'Babylon the Great.' What
symbolical title could better describe papal Rome; for has she
not been the worldly, idolatrous, proud, persecuting power in
the history of the Christian church which the literal Baby-
lon was in the history of apostate Israel?"—"Key to the
Apocalypse," page 75.
    "I now know and am sure that the papacy is the king-
dom •of Babylon."—Martin Luther, quoted in "Luther's Pri-
mary Works," page 295.
    1. The first five chapters of Daniel contain sketches of
history which are also of the nature of prophecy. Although
Babylon of the East perished long ago, yet the Babylonish
principles have survived, and they are now reproduced in
Babylon of the West. It is the purpose of the prophecies in
the latter part of the book of Daniel to show this, and to
foretell the rise, the work, and the fall of modern Babylon.
    2. In the Kophecy of the seventh chapter of Daniel, an
outline of world history is given, corresponding to the Outline
presented to Nebuchadnezzar in the second chapter, in which
the fortunes of Rome constitute the leading feature. As
the fourth beast represents the fourth kingdom (Dan. 7: 23),
it follows that the third beast represents the third kingdom,
 the second the second, and the first the first, reckoning from
the time of the prophet. We therefore have in this chapter
 a foreview of Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome; but
the fourth kingdom commands the chief attention.
    3. As the fourth beast is different from all known animals
 (verse 7, first part), so the fourth kingdom is different from
all other kingdoms (verse 23). The fourth beast had ten
 horns (verse 7, last clause), which represented the ten king-
doms into which Rome was divided (verse 24, first clause).
 While the prophet was looking at these ten horns, another
horn arose among them, of a peculiar kind (verse 8), which
was" interpreted to represent a king of an entirely different
 character (verse 24).
     4. It is evident that the dragon with ten horns (Rev.
12: 3), and the first beast of the thirteenth chapter of
34          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

Revelation (Rev. 13: 1), and the scarlet-colored beast (Rev.
17: 3), symbolize different phases of the fourth kingdom of
the seventh chapter of Daniel; but in the last phase, we
find a woman guiding and controlling this power, who bears
the telltale label, "Babylon the Great" (Rev. 17: 5). We
are therefore warranted in concluding that in the little horn
of the seventh chapter of Daniel we have a prophetic picture
of the rise, work, and fall of modern Babylon,—a power in
which the essential features of ancient Babylon will be re-
produced. This power is more commonly known as the
papacy.
    5. Ancient Babylon persecuted those who refused to wor-
ship according to her decree (Dan. 3: 4-6) ; so did the little
horn (Dan. 7: 21) ; so has modern Babylon, the papacy. An-
cient Babylon exalted itself against God (Dan. 3: 15; 4: 30) ;
so did the little horn (Dan. 7: 25, first clause) ; so has modern
Babylon, the papacy (2 Thess. 2: 4). The Lord gave His
people into the hands of ancient Babylon (Dan. 1: 1," 2) ;
so did He give His people into the hands of the little horn
 (Dan. 7: 25, last clause) ; so has He •given. His people into
the hands of modern Babylon, the papacy. The captivity
in ancient Babylon, was for a definite time (Jer. 25: 11),
and so the captivity in modern Babylon is for a definite time
 (Dan. 7: 25, last clause). In place of the Sabbath of God's
holy law, ancient Babylon set up a festival of its own (see
note 5) ; so did the little horn, the papacy (Dan. 7: 25).
 (See note 6.) In ancient Babylon, Lucifer, 46 god of this
world, attempted to establish a universal kingdom in opposi-
tion to the kingdom of God (Isa. 14: 4, 12-14), with the king
of Babylon as his vicegerent; and after this attempt had
failed, he tried the same thing in modern Babylon, under a
different guise (Rev. 13: 2, last clause; 12: 9, first clause).
Ancient Babylon fell because it rejected the threefold gospel
message which God sent to Nebuchadnezzar (Dan. 5: 22-24),
and modern Babylon will be destroyed because of the rejec-
tion of the threefold gospel message sent in the last days
 (Rev. 14: 6-11). The fall of ancient Babylon as described
by Jeremiah (Jer. 51: 63, 64), finds its exact counterpart in
the description of the fall of modern Babylon (Rev. 18: 21).
    6. Through His death on the cross, Christ won the king-
dom of this world, and cast out the usurper (John 12: 31-33;
Heb. 2: 14) ; and through the preaching of a crucified Christ
(1 Cor. 1: 23, first clause), the results of His victory will be
fully realized, and the great petition of our Lord's prayer will
be answered (Matt. 6: 10).

                                   Notes
                             ATHEIST AND ANTICHRIST
    1. "Throughout the extent of Bible history, from Genesis to Revelation,
one city remains, which in fact and symbol is execrated as the enemy of
God and the stronghold of evil. In Genesis we are called to see its founda-
tion, as of _the first city that wandering men established, and the quick ruin,
which fell upon, its impious builders. By the prophets we hear it cursed
as the oppressor of God's people, the temptress of the nations, full of cruelty
and wantonness. And in the book of Revelation its character and curse
are transferred to Rome, and the New Babylon stands over against the New
Jerusalem.
    "The tradition and infection, which have made thy name of Babylon as
abhorred in Scripture as Satan's own, are represented as the tradition and
infection of pride,—the pride, which, in the audacity of youth, proposes to
attempt to be equal with God : Go to, let us build us a city and a tower,
whose top may touch heaven, and let us make us a name; the pride, which,
amid the success and wealth of later years, forgets that there is a God at
all: Thou sayest in thine heart, I am, and there is none beside me. Babylon
is the atheist of the Old Testament, as she is the antichrist of the New."—
"The Expositor's Bible" (Isaiah, volume 2), page 189.

                    THE PAPACY A GREAT FACT
  2. "The papacy, next to Christianity, is the great fact of the modern
world."—"The Papacy" (Wylie), page 1.

                           THE PAGANISM OF BABYLON
    3. "It has been known all along that popery was baptized paganism; but
God is now making it manifest that the paganism which Rome has baptized
is, in all its essential elements, the very paganism which prevailed in the
ancient literal Babylon."—"The Two Babylons," page 2.

              •      TYPICAL AND ANTITYPICAL BABYLON
   4. "The language applied to the New Testament Babylon, as the reader
cannot fail to see, naturally leads us back to the Babylon of the ancient
world. As the Apocalyptic woman has in her hand, a cup, wherewith she
intoxicates the nations, so was it with the Babylon of old. Of that Babylon,
while in all its glory, the Lord thus spake, in denouncing its doom by the
prophet Jeremiah: 'Babylon bath been a golden cup in the Lord's hand, that
made all the earth drunken : the nations have drunken of her wine ; there-
fore the nations are mad.' Jer. 51: 7. Why this exact similarity of lan-
guage in regard to the two systemd? The natural inference surely is, that
the one stands to the other in the relation of type and antitype."—Id., page 4.
              SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                            37
                         THE BABYLONIAN SABBATH
    6. "A calendar of saints' days for the month of the intercalary Elul
makes the seventh, fourteenth, twenty-first and twenty-eighth days of the
lunar month Sabbaths, on which certain works were forbidden to be done.
On those days, it is stated, 'flesh cooked on the fire may not be eaten, the
clothing of the body may not be changed, 'white garments may not be put
on, a sacrifice may not be offered, the king may not ride in his chariot, or
speak in public, the augur may not mutter in a secret place, medicine of the
body may not be applied, nor may any curse be uttered.' . . . Where the [time
of the] Babylonian Sabbath differed from the Jewish one was in its es-
sentially lunar character. 'ate first Sabbath was the first day of the month,
whatever might be the length of the month that preceded it."—"Fresh Light
 from the Ancient Monuments." pages 24, 25.

   6. "Ques. Which is the Sabbath day?
      "Ans. Saturday is the Sabbath day.
      "Ques. Why do we observe Sunday instead of Saturday?
      "Ans. We observe Sunday instead of Saturday because the ,Catholic
Church, in the Council of Laodicea (A. D. 336), transferred the solemnity
from Saturday to Sunday."—"The Convert's Catechism of Catholic Doctrine,"

                            Synopsis
    SEED THOUGHT: "When those that 'believed not the truth,
but had pleasure in unrighteousness,' shall be left to receive
strong delusion and to believe a lie, then the light of truth
will shine upon all whose hearts are open to receive it, and
all the children of the Lord that remain in Babylon will
heed the call, 'Come out of her, My people.' "—"The Great
Controversy," page 390.
    1. Babylon in history is the concrete expression of selfish-
ness, pride, atheism, the idolatry of self. In all these respects,
it is in absolute contrast with the kingdom of God, in which
the law of self-sacrificing love controls. In ancient Babylon,
this opposition to the kingdom of God found expression in the
gross idolatry of paganism, and the deification of the state,
with a religion of a distinct character in which the names
of the deities and the ritual of worship were entirely differ-
ent from the names and the ritual employed in Jerusalem.
This was ti:le outworking of Satan's determined plan to shut
38          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

out from the world the kingdom of God, the kingdom of right-
 eousness, and to bring all peoples under his own arbitrary
 power. In his scheme, however, there was no provision for
personal fellowship with his subjects (Dan. 2: 11), but the
 false worship was enforced by state power (Dan. 3: 4-6).
     2. When the real meaning of Christianity was revealed
through the union of divinity and humanity in the gift of the
Son of God to become the Son of man, and thus the mystery
of godliness was manifested (1 Tim. ;: 16), and so became a
fact of experience (Col. 1: 27), a power was conferred upon
believers (Acts 1: 8), which enabled'the early church to con-
quer paganism (Rev. 6: 2). In order to meet this new devel-
opment which threatened the overthrow of his kingdom, the
god of this world devised that counterfeit of the mystery of
godliness which the Scripture designates as the mystery
of inicluity (2 Thess. 2: 7), which is in reality a reproduction
of the paganism of ancient Babylon under the guise of
Christianity. Thus arose the papacy, or modern Babylon.
A visible head of the church, and human priests and media-
tors, shut away Christ, the true head of the church (Eph.
1: 22) and the only priest and mediator (Heb. 8: 1, 2) ; and,
as in ancient Babylon, this false religion was enforced by
the power of the state.
     3. The Reformation of the sixteenth century was an at-
tempt to restore true Christianity to the people by giving to
Christ His rightful place as the only head of the church, the
only priest and mediator. Those who protested against the
claims and the worldly power of the Roman Church were
called Protestants, and the reformed religion was desig-
nated as Protestantism. In the counter reformation which fol-
lowed, much which had been lost was restored to Rome; and
in later times, and especially during the last century, there
has been such a departure from the fundamental principles of
the gospel of Christ as revealed in the Scriptures, and em-
phasized in original Protestantism, that there is now but
little effectual protest against the efforts of modern Babylon
to become once more the mistress of the world. Thus the
effort of the god of this world to establish his kingdom by
controlling the consciences of men, has given rise to pagan-
ism, Romanism, and false Protestantism, three phases of the
Babylonish principles, selfishness, pride, atheism, and the
idolatry of self.
     4. The call to Abraham to leave his country and his kin-
dred (Gen. 12: 1), was the first call out of Babylon (Gen.
15: 7). Because of their apostasy from God and their accept-
ance of the idolatries which had originally come from
Babylon (Jer. 50: 38), the people of God were driven out of
Jerusalem (Jer. 9: 13-16), and taken to Babylon, to whose
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   39

ways their hearts had already turned (Jr.  e 25: 4-11). Under
the reign of Cyrus, king of Persia, there was a call out of
Babylon (Ezra 1: 2, 3), to which only a portion of the people
responded. The Reformation of the sixteenth century was
another distinct call to come out of Babylon, but the move-
ment was checked before it had accomplished its complete
work.
    5. In these last days, Babylon includes not simply modern
Babylon in its organized form, the Roman Church, but also
those religious systems which once protested against Baby-
lon, but have now in reality accepted her worldly principles
in place of the true principles of the gospel of Christ. The
final warning concerning Babylon is being given in the three-
fold message of Rev. 14: 6-12, represented in this second
advent movement. This proclamation of the everlasting
gospel gives to Christ His place as the head of the church,
the only priest and mediator in the heavenly sanctuary, and
the only Saviour. This message will swell to a loud cry in
the last call to come out of Babylon (Rev. 18: 1-4) ; and
when it shall have finished its world-wide work, Babylon and
all included with her will fall to rise no more (Rev. 18: 21-23).
Thus the kingdom of Satan will be utterly overthrown.

                                   Notes
                            THE Two MYSTERIES
   1. "We read but once of the 'mystery of godliness,', and but once of the
'mystery of iniquity.' They are the two preeminently grand mysteries of
revelation. They stand over against each other: the 'mystery of iniquity,'
fashioning its outward character and semblance upon the 'mystery of godli-
ness,' making it its pattern, till at last the 'mystery of iniquity' presents
itself to the world a perfect imitation and counterfeit of the 'mystery of
godliness.' "-"The Papacy Is the Antichrist," page 24.

                                A MORAL FALIL
    2. "The fall of Babylon here spoken of [Rev. 18: 2] cannot be literal
destruction ; for there are events to take place in Babylon after her fall
which utterly forbid this idea ; as, for instance, the people of God are there
after her fall, and are called out in order that they may not receive of her
plagues; and in these plagues is embraced her literal destruction. The fall
is therefore a moral one; for the result of it is that Babylon becomes the
habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every
unclean and hateful bird. These are terrible descriptions of apostasy, show-
ing that, as a consequence of her fall, she piles up an accumulation of sins
even to the heavens, and becomes subject to the judgments of God, which
42            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

can no longer be delayed."—"Daniel and the Revelation," pages 709, 710,
latest edition.
                            THE FINAL WARNING
    3. "Of Babylon, at the time brought to view in this prophecy, it is de-
clared, 'Her sins have reached unto heaven, and God bath remembered her
iniquities.' She has filled up the measure of her guilt, and destruction is
about to fall upon her. But God still has a people in Babylon ; and before
the visitation of His judgments, these faithful ones must be called out, that
they 'partake not of her sins, and receive not of her plagues.' Hence the
movement symbolized by the angel coming down from heaven, lightening
the earth with his glory, and crying mightily with a strong voice, announc-
ing the sins of Babylon. In connection with his message the call is heard,
'Come out of her, My people.' These announcements, uniting with the third
angel's message, constitute the final warning to be given to,the inhabitants
of the earth."—"The Great Controversy," page 604.

                            Synopsis
    SEED THOUGHT: "In His parable teaching Christ linked
divine truth with common things and incidents."—"Christ's
Object Lessons," Preface, page 7.
    1. Much of the instruction which Christ imparted con-
cerning the kingdom is found in His parables. Some of these
will be considered in this lesson.
    2. A notable group of parables concerning the kingdom
is found in the thirteenth chapter of Matthew, which opens
with the parable of the sower. The special features here'
emphasized are these: the kingdom is to be established by
the preaching of the word of God (Matt. 13: 19, first clause;
Luke 8: 11), and this preaching will be attended by varying
results. The Lord Himself sows the seed, but some permit
the enemy to prevent it from taking root. Matt. 13: 19, latter
part. Some appear to receive the word joyfully, but are
easily overcome by the trials which beset the Christian path-
way. Verses 20, 21. In the case of others, their minds are
too much absorbed with the things of this world, so that no
fruit is borne. Verse 22. Those who fully accept the gospel
message and really understand it, give proof of this by fruit-
bearing, although in different degrees. Verse 23. Whatever
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    43
degree of failure there may be, is due to the hearer, and not
to the word preached.
    3. In the next parable, that of the wheat and the tares,
the same principle of seed-sowing is presented, but the new
feature is the work of the enemy and how to deal with it.
 The good seed was sown (verse 24), the word of the kingdom
was proclaimed; but the enemy adopted the same method
in propagating doubt and falsehood (verse 25). The law
of reproduction was not suspended in the case of the tares.
Verse 26. Drastic measures in dealing with the evil might
work disastrously for the good. Verses 28, 29. During this
time of probation, the perversion of right principles must
be permitted as a necessary consequence of freedom of the
will; but the rewards and the punishments of the Judgment
are determined in this life. Verse 30. Satan's work is to
apply to wrong uses the principles and the power of the
kingdom of God. Compare verses 36-42.
    4. The vitality of the truths of the kingdom which enables
it to develop from the smallest beginning is emphasized in
the parable of the mustard seed. Verses 31, 32.
     5. The pervasive power of the principles of the kingdom
of God, when a field of opportunity is given them, is set
forth in the parable of the leaven hidden in the meal.
Verse 33.
    6. The priceless value of the kingdom, and the absolute
necessity of surrendering all worldly aims and ambitions
in order to gain it, are the lessons taught in the parables
of the treasure hidden in the field and the pearl of great
 price. Verses 44-46. We cannot hold the world in one hand
 and the kingdom of heaven in the other. Christ must be
all to us, or He is nothing.
     7. That the end of the gospel age will bring the irrevocable
separation between the righteous and the wicked, and that
 the triumph of righteousness in the kingdom of. God will mean
 the absolute destruction of evil by extinction of those who
have cherished sin and refused the gift of righteousness, is
 the teaching of the last parable in this chapter. Verses 47-50.
    8. In another parable, Christ compared the kingdom of
 God to the growth of the seed cast upon the earth, and set
 forth the inherent power of the word of the kingdom as
 revealed in growth and fruitage. Mark 4: 26-28.
     9. "With many such parables" Jesus spoke to the people;
 but these are sufficient to teach the leading characteristics
 of the kingdom of God in its working among men.
                         Questions
   1. In what form did Christ impart much of His instruction
concerning the kingdom of God? See synopsis, paragraph 1.

                                 Notes
             THE HEAVENLY REVEALED THROUGH THE EARTHLY
  1. "In Christ's parable-teaching the same principle is seen as in His own
mission to the world. That we might become acquainted with His divine
character and life, Christ took our nature, and dwelt among us. Divinity
was revealed in humanity ; the invisible glory in the visible human form.
Men could learn`of the unknown through the known; heavenly things were
              SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                              45

revealed through the _earthly; God was made manifest in the likeness of
men. So it was in Christ's teaching ; the unknown was illustrated by the
known; divine truths by earthly things with which the people were most
familiar."--"Christ's Object Lessons," page 17.

                           THE INWARD CHANGE
   2. "As the leaven, when mingled with the meal, works from within out-
ward, so it is by the renewing of the heart that the grace of God works to
transform the life. No mere external change is sufficient to bring us into
harmony with God. There are many who try to reform by correcting this or
that bad habit, and they hope in this way to become Christians, but they are
beginning in the wrong place. Our first work is with the heart."—Id., page 97.

                           A DOUBLE SIGNIFICANCE
   3. "The parable of the merchantman seeking goodly pearls has a double
significance: it applies not only to men as seeking the kingdom of heaven,
but to Christ as seeking His lost inheritance."—Id., page 118.
                        No PROBATION AFTER DEATH
   4. "These parables [of the tares and the net] teach that there is to be
no probation after the Judgment. When the work of the gospel is completed,
there immediately follows the separation between the good and the evil, and
the destiny of each class is forever fixed."—Id., page 123.

   SEED THOUGHT: "The hour has come when Christ occupies
His rightful position, and is glorified above principalities and
46          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
powers and every name that is named."—"The Great Con-
 troversy," page 671.
    1. All the prophets bore witness to Christ (Acts 10: 43),
testifying concerning His sufferings and the glories that
should follow them (1 Peter 1: 10, 11). The prophecies con-
 cerning His sufferings were fulfilled at the time of the first
advent (1 Peter 3: 18), and the prophecies concerning the
glories that should follow them will be fulfilled at the second
advent (Matt. 25: 31; Luke 24: 26).
    2. It is the work of Christ to restore (Isa. 49: 6) ; and the
disciples rightly understood that this restoration extended
to the kingdom, although they were uncertain as to the time
 (Acts 1: 6). The good news concerning the restoration of
the kingdom must be announced throughout the world (Matt.
24: 14), and this glorious consummation will be fully realized
when Christ shall return from heaven to earth (Acts 3: 20,
21; Matt. 25: 31).
    3. Christ's desire was that "His own" should be with Him
in glory (John 17: 24) ; and just before His departure from
earth to heaven, He promised His disciples that He would
return for them (John 14: 3). This promise that He would
come again was repeated to them at the time of the ascension
 (Acts 1: 11), and that coming is definitely mentioned as His
second appearance (Heb. 9: 28).
    4. Those who have received Christ as the Lord of their
lives (John 20: 28), and have become subjects of His kingdom
 (Col. 1: 12, 13), even though they have fallen asleep, will be
remembered in the day of triumph when Jesus returns to
earth (1 Thess. 4: 13, 14). The righteous living will have
no advantage over them in that day (verse 15), for the living
and "the dead in Christ" will meet their Lord at the same
time (verses 16, 17). Thus will the subjects of the kingdom
enter upon the joy of their Lord. Matt. 25: 21.
    5. Christ taught His disciples and us to pray for the
coming of the kingdom (Matt. 6: 10) ; He Himself preached
the gospel of the kingdom (Matt. 9: 35) ; the thief on the
cross recognized the relation between the kingdom and His
coming (Luke 23: 42), as did also the apostle Paul (2 Tim.
4: 1) ; and for this appearing we are to be looking (Titus
2: 13).
    6. The definite time of the great consummation has not
been revealed (Matt. 24: 36) ; but the fulfillment of the
signs foretold by Christ Himself will declare its nearness
(verses 33, 34), and the mocking of those who believe in the
unchanging order of nature will itself , be an indication of
"the last days" (2 Peter 3: 3, 4).
    7. We are living in the time of the sounding of the seventh
angel, when the mystery of God (the gospel) is to be finished
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                 47
(Rev. 10: 7), and the kingdom is given to Christ (Rev. 11: 15)
and to those who are "in Christ." Then God will be glorified
in the exaltation of His Son as Lord of all. Phil. 2: 9-11.
                           Questions
    1. To whom did all the prophets bear witness? Acts
10: 43.
    2. Concerning what did they testify? 1 Peter 1: 10, 11.

                                    Note
                             THE KINGDOM COME
   " 'I saw a new heaven and a new earth ; for the first heaven and the first
earth were passed away.' The fire that consumes the wicked purifies the
earth. Every trace of the curse is swept away. No eternally burning hell
will keep before the ransomed the fearful consequences of sin.
   "One reminder alone remains: our Redeemer will ever bear the marks of
His crucifixion. Upon His wounded head, upon His side, His hands and
feet, are the only traces of the cruel work that sin has wrought. Says the
prophet, beholding Christ in His glory, 'He had bright beams coming out
of His side; and there was the hiding of His power.' That pierced side
whence flowed the crimson stream that reconciled man to God,—there is the
Saviour's glory, there 'the hiding of His power.' Mighty to save,' through
the sacrifice of redemption, He was therefore strong to execute justice upon
them that despised God's mercy. And the tokens of His humiliation are
His highest honor; through the eternal ages the wounds of Calvary will
show forth His praise, and declare His power.
   "'O Tower of the flock, the stronghold of the daughter of Zion, unto Thee
shall it come, even the first dominion.' The time has come, to which holy
men have looked with longing since the flaming sword barred the first pair
from Eden,—the time for 'the redemption of the purchased possession.'
The earth originally given to man as his kingdom, betrayed by him into the
hands of Satan, and so long held by the mighty foe, has been brought back
by the great plan of redemption. All that was lost by sin has been restored.
'Thus saith the Lord . . . that formed the earth and made it; He hath
established it, He created it not in vain, He formed it to be inhabited.' God's
original purpose in the creation of the earth is fulfilled as it is made the
eternal abode of the redeemed. 'The righteous shall inherit the land, and
dwell therein forever.' "—"The Great Controversy," pages 673, 674.
