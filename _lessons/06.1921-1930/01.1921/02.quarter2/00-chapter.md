                           Synopsis
    SEED THOUGHT: "`By coming to dwell with us, Jesus was
to reveal God both to men and to angels."—"The Desire of
Ages," page 19.
    1. God the Father is known to us only in so far as the Son
reveals Him to us (Matt. 11: 27), but the Son has declared
God to us (John 1: 18). The Son revealed God to us by being
"God with us." Matt. 1: 23. Christ, the Son of God, was
and is the visible image of God (Col. 1: 15), the' emanation
of His glory (Heb. 1: 3). In Him is found the fullness of
the Godhead (Col. 2: 9), so that God was in Christ (2 Cor.
5: 19). So perfect a revelation of the Father was made in
and through Christ, that to see Him was to see the Father
John 14: 9; 12: 45.
    2. As there are seven different colors that enter into the
composition of white light, so we may study Christ's complete
revelation of God under seven different aspects:
    God is light (1 John 1: 5), and Christ is the manifesta-
tion of that light to the world (John 8: 12; 9: 5).
    God is the fountain of life (Ps. 36: 9), and in Christ this
life was revealed to the world (John 14: 6). Compare
John 5: 26.
    God is love (1 John 4: 8), and this love was manifested
through His gift of His Son (John 3: 16), and in the volun-
taiy sacrifice which Christ made for us (1 John 3: 16).
    God is righteous (Ps. 7: 9), and righteousness is the "foun-
dation of His throne" (Ps. 97: 2, A. R. V.). Christ in the
flesh is "the Lord our righteousness" (Jer. 23: 5, 6), and He
is made unto us righteousness (1 Cor. 1: 30).
    God is wise (Rom. 16: 27), and He established the heavens
by His wisdom (Jer. 10: 12), and in wisdom made all His
works (Ps. 104: 24). All the treasures of wisdom are in
Christ (Col. 2: 3), and Christ is the manifested wisdom of
4            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

 God (1 Cor. 1: 24), being Himself made wisdom unto us
 (verse 30).
     Power belongs to God (Ps.' 62 : 11), who made the earth
 by His power (Jer. 51: 15), and to Him power is to be as-
 cribed (1 Chron. 29: 11). Christ is the manifested power of
 God (1 Cor. 1:24), and He upholds all things by the word
 of His power (Heb. 1: 3).
     God is the God of glory (Acts 7: 2), and the Father of
 glory (Eph. 1: 17). He has condescended to be the glory
of His people. Isa. 60: 19; Zech. 2: 5. In Christ, the glory of
 God was manifested (John 1: 14), and He is the Lord of
 glory (1 Cor. 2: 8).
     This sevenfold revelation of God was not in the abstract,
 but was made concrete in the life and work of Christ. In His
life before the world, and in the works that He wrought, He
was constantly revealing the light, the life, the love, the right-
 eousness, the wisdom, the power, and the glory, of God the
Father.

                                   Notes
                              "GOD WITH US"
   1. " 'The light of the knowledge of the glory of God' is seen 'in the face
of Jesus Christ.' From the days of eternity the Lord Jesus Christ was one
with the Father ; He was tthe image of God,' the image of His greatness and
majesty, 'the outshining of His glory.' It was to manifest this glory that
He came to our world. To this sin-darkened earth He came to reveal the
light of God's love,— to be `God with us.' Therefore it was prophesied of
Him, 'His name shall be called Immanuel."' —"The Desire of Ages," page 19.
                       CHRIST THE HIGHEST REVELATION
    2. "How is this revelation conferred? Not, as in the case of the ancient
prophets, by dreams and visions of the night; not even as with Moses, when
God talked to His servant face to face ; but by the fact that the Father is in
Christ, as the Son is in the Father, so that not only His Word, but His whole
person, may be spoken of as a visible and palpable revelation of the Father.
God presents Himself to our contemplation in this form, in which He can
best be understood and comprehended by men, in the form of a truly human,
but divine-human life. In His incarnate Son, He Himself walks among the
children of Adam, and does not merely tell them, but shows them, who He
is and what He wills for their salvation."—"The Person and Work of the
Redeemer," pages 284, 235.

                           Synopsis
    SEED THOUGHT:    "Of Him are ye in Christ Jesus, who was
made unto us . . . redemption." 1 Cor. 1: 30, A. R. V.
   1. If the inquiry should be made of each one of us, "How
much owest thou unto My Lord?" (Luke 16: 5), we should be
obliged to answer that the debt is infinite, that we have noth-
ing "wherewith to pay" (Matt. 18: 25, A. R. V.), and that our
6          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

only hope is that the debt will be forgiven (Matt. 6: 12),
"through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus" (Rom. 3: 24).
    2. The thought of redemption is a prominent one in the
Scriptures. It is not the usual payment of a stipulated sum
of money (1 Peter 1: 18), but involves the life of Christ
 (Matt. 20: 28), as represented by the shedding of His blood
(1 Peter 1: 19; Matt. 26: 28).
    3. The lesson of redemption was taught in the deliverance
of the children of Israel (Ex. 6: 6), "whom God went to re-
deem unto Himself for a people" (2 Sam. 7:23, A. R. V.).
The same lesson was suggested in the redemption of land and
houses (Lev. 25: 23-28), and more distinctly in the case of a
person who had sold himself (verses 47, 48). The fact that
the one who redeemed him must be "nigh of kin" (verse 49),
was the prophecy of the Redeemer who would take part of the
same flesh and blood with those whom He redeemed (Heb.
2: 14). This same requirement is emphasized in the story of
redemption told in the book of Ruth. 'Ruth 4: 1-6.
    4. The redeeming name of God in the Old Testament is
"Jehovah," as is shown in Ex. 6: 2, 3, 6-8, A. R. V.' But Je-
hovah is manifested in the person of Jesus, whose name means
"Jehovah for salvation," a name given to Him because He
should save from sin. Matt. 1: 21. Redemption is not a gift
apart from Christ, but is found in Him. Eph. 1: 7. He has
redeemed us from the curse of the law (Gal. 3: 13) by giving
Himself as the price for our sins (Gal. 1: 4). When His com-
ing is near, our redemption "draweth nigh." Luke 21: 28.
    5. Having redeemed the children of Israel out of Egypt,
the Lord regarded them as a purchaSed people (Ex. 15: 16),
a people whom He had bought (Deut. 32: 6). So also we read
of those who deny "the Lord that bought them" (2 Peter 2: 1),
and Christians are said to be "bought with a price" (1 Cor.
6: 20).
    6. Christ, through His life of obedience and His sacrifice
on the cross, has "obtained eternal redemption for us" (Heb.
9: 12), and the song of praise in heaven is directed to the
Lamb who has redeemed men by His blood (Rev. 5: 9, 10).
                          Questions
   1. How great is our debt to the Lord? Luke 16: 5; Matt.
18: 25.
    2. On what ground only can we hope concerning this debt?
Matt. 6: 12.
    3. In whom alone is redemption found? Rom. 3: 24.
    4. What statement of the Scriptures distinguishes our re-
demption from the usual commercial transaction with money?
1 Peter 1: 18.
              SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

    5. What has been given as the ransom? Matt. 20: 28.
    6. How is this ransom otherwise represented? 1 Peter
1: 19; Matt. 26: 28.
    7. In what experience is the lesson of redemption taught?
Ex. 6: 6; 2 Sam. 7: 23, A. R. V.
    8. How was this same lesson connected with the handling
of land and houses? Lev. 25: 23-28.
    9. What provision was made concerning a person who had
sold himself? and what does this suggest? Verses 47, 48.
  10. What condition of relationship was imposed upon one
who wished to qualify as a redeemer of another? Verse 49.
  11. What does this foreshadow? Heb. 2: 14.
  12. What is one of the lessons emphasized in the book of
Ruth? Ruth 4: 1-6.
  13. What is the redeeming name of God in the Old Testa-
ment? Ex. 6:.2, 3, 6-8, A. R. V.
  14. In whom has Jehovah been manifested? and what is the
significance of His name? Matt. 1: 21.
  15. In whom do we have redemption? Eph. 1: 7. •
  16. Who has redeemed us from the curse of the law? Gal.
3: 13.
  17. What price did He give for our sins? Gal. 1: 4.
  18. What again identifies our redemption with the person
of Christ? Luke 21: 28.
  19. How did the Lord regard the people whom He had re-
deemed? Ex. 15: 16; Deut. 32: 6.
   20. Whom do some false teachers deny? 2 Peter 2: 1.
   21. Viewed from the same standpoint, how are Christians
described? 1 Cor. 6: 20.
   22. What has Christ obtained for us? Heb. 9: 12.
   23. To whom is the song of praise in heaven directed?
Rev. 5: 9, 10.
                                   Notes
                       WHAT MORE, COULD BE DONE?
   1. "The Saviour's life and death and intercession, the ministry of angels,
the pleading of the Spirit, the Father working above and through all, 'the
unceasing interest of heavenly beings,- all are enlisted in behalf of man's
redemption."-"Steps to Christ," page 24.

                            CHRIST THE RANSOM
   2. "He 'gave Himself a ransom - the good Shepherd giveth His life for
the sheep.' He suffers in our room and stead ; He bears inflictions incurred
by our sins, and due to ourselves ; He does this at the divine will, and under
the divine law: what is this but to 'buy us out,' to pay the price which
frees us from the prison house of death?"-"The Epistle to the Galatians"
(Findlay). vanes 194, 195.

                           Synopsis
    SEED THOUGHT: "As we behold the Lamb of God upon the
cross of Calvary, the mystery of redemption begins to unfold
to our minds."—"Steps to Christ," page 30.
    1. Not any one of the Gospels, nor all four taken together,
give us a biography of Christ in the ordinary meaning of
that word. They were not written to record simply an ordered
history of the earthly experience of the man of Nazareth, but
they present us the gospel as revealed in the words and works
of Jesus, using such incidents in His life and such a summary
of His teaching as will best serve this purpose. Each of the
four records emphasizes a different phase of the gospel, and
there are therefore characteristic differences between them;
but in one respect they are alike—they all lay special stress
upon the death of Christ. "Out of thirty pages devoted to the
first Gospel, no less than ten are given to the record of the
last week.. . . Out of twenty-four pages in the fourth Gospel,
ten are actually concerned with the same period."
    2. John the Baptist called attention to Christ as the Lamb
of God. John 1: 29. Christ definitely fulfilled the prophecy
of Isaiah concerning the lamb led to the slaughter. Isa. 53: 7.
Compare Acts 8: 32-35. Every sacrifice offered in the typical
service was a prophecy of Christ our sacrifice. Eph. 5: 2.
Our sins were laid on Him (Isa. 53: 6), and He "carried up
our sins in His body to the tree" (1 Peter 2: 24, A. R. V., mar-
gin). Thus He died for our sins (1 Cor. 15: 3), bearing the
sins of many (Heb. 9: 28).
    3. The Father gave His Son (John 3: 16), sending Him to
be "the propitiation for our sins" (1 John 2: 2) ; and His own
people to whom He came "killed the Prince of life" (Acts
3:15), crucifying Him (Acts 4: 10) • yet He voluntarily laid
down Hiso life for our salvation (John 10: 17, 18). Thus He
"gave Himself for our sins." Gal. 1: 4.
    4. Christ "was delivered up for our trespasses" (Rom.
4: 25, A. R. V.), dying for the ungodly (Rom. 5: 6), or for
sinners (verse 8). For God did not spare even His own Son,
"but delivered Him up for us all." Rom. 8: 32.
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  9
     5. By His death, Christ conquered Satan, and delivered us
 from the bondage of sin. Heb. 2: 14, 15. Compare John
12: 31. By His death, we were reconciled to God (Rom.
5: 10), since He tasted death for all (Heb. 2: 9). Through
. His death, there came redemption (Heb. 9: 15, A. R. V.), and
 "without shedding of blood is no remission" (verse 22).
     6. Again and again is reference made in the Scriptures to
 the fact that Christ died in place of the sinner. See Rom.
14: 15; 1 Cor. 8: 11; 2 Cor. 5:15.
     7. As the good Shepherd, He gave His life for the sheep.
 John 19: 11. He declared that it was the corn of wheat that
 died which brought forth much fruit (John 12: 24), and spoke
 of giving up life as the greatest proof of love (John 15: 13).
 In instituting the supper, He referred to His blood as poured
 out for many. Matt. 26: 28. It is thus evident that from the
 beginning of His ministry (John 2: 19), during His ministry
  (Matt. 16: 21), and at the close of His ministry (Matt. 20:
17, 18), Jesus looked forward to the cross as the climax of
 His work in behalf of man.

of His life on earth? John 2: 19; Matt. 16: 21; 20: 17, 18.
                                   Notes
                       GOD SUFFERED WITH     His SON
   1. "The Father loves us, not because of the great propitiation, but He
provided the propitiation because He loves us. Christ ,was the medium
through which He could pour out His infinite love upon a fallen world.
'God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto Himself.' God suffered with
His Son. In the agony of Gethsemane, the death of Calvary, the heart of
Infinite Love paid the price of our redemption."—"Steps to Christ," pages
14, 15.
                             CHRIST OUR SACRIFICE
   2. "And all that He endured,—the' blood drops that flowed from His
head, His hands, His feet, the agony that racked His frame, and the unut-
terable anguish that filled His soul at the hiding of His Father's face,—
speaks to each child of humanity, declaring, It is for thee that the Son.of
God consents to bear this burden of guilt; for thee He spoils the domain of
death, and opens the gates of Paradise. He . . . offers Himself upon the
cross /as a sacrifice, and this from love to thee. He, the Sin-bearer, endures
the wrath of divine justice, and for thy sake becomes sin itself."—"The
Desire of Ages," page 755.

                           Synopsis
    SEED THOUGHT: "The only proper explanation of Cli.ris-
tianity to-day is the resurrection of Christ."—"The Interna-
tional Standard Bible Encyclopedia," page 2569.
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   11

   "By His word and His works He [Christ] declared Him-
self the Author of the resurrection."—"The Desire of Ages,"
page 530.
    1. The heart of Christianity is found in the statement of
the risen Jesus to the apostle John: "I am the first and the
last: I am He that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am
alive forevermore." Rev. 1: 17, 18. For Christianity is not
a mere system of doctrine, but is the manifested life of a Pei-
son in whom all the doctrines appear.
    2. It is clear, from the record in the four Gospels, that
Christ Himself anticipated His resurrection. Matt. 16: 21;
Mark 9: 31; Luke 18: 31-33; John 2: 19-22. In the gospel as
taught by the disciples of Jesus, the central fact was the res-
urrection. Acts 1: 21, 22; 4: 2, 33. In what is thought to be
the first of the documents composing the New Testament,
written about 51 A. D., the fact of the death and resurrection
of Christ is definitely mentioned. 1 Thess. 4: 14. Other ref-
erences to the resurrection in the New Testament are too
numerous even to list here, and the fundamental importance
of this fact to the believer is plainly set forth. 1 Cor. 15: 17.
    3. The resurrection is in itself proof of the deity of Christ
 (Rom. 1:4), and is the ground of our justification (Rom.
4: 25). In the death, burial, and resurrection of Christ, as
He had received these facts and their meaning, the apostle
Paul found the gospel which he preached. 1 Cor. 15: 1-4. In
the resurrection of Christ,-is involved the resurrection of all
men. Verses 12, 20-22.
    4. Our salvation is based upon faith in the resurrection
of Christ (Rom. 10: 9), and the power for deliverance from
sin is found in the risen Jesus (Acts 3 : 26). This resurrec-
tion power is to be known by every believer. Eph. 1: 19, 20;
Phil. 3: 10.
    5. It is the living Christ in heaven who makes intercession
for us (Heb. 7: 25), and it is the life of an indwelling Christ
 (Eph. 3: 17) which is to be manifested in us during this pres-
ent earthly experience (2 Cor. 4: 10, 11). It is therefore
evident that "Christianity is emphatically the gospel of the
resurrection."
                             Questions
    1. In what statement is the heart of Christianity found?
Rev. 1 : 17, 18.
    2. In what does real Christianity consist? See synopsis,
paragraph 1, last part.
    3. What statements made by Jesus show that He antici-
pated His resurrection? Matt. 16: 21; Mark 9:31; Luke
18: 31-33 ; John 2: 19-22.                                        •

                                   Notes
                        THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST
    1. Read the description of the resurrection scene and the testimony of
His enemies concerning the resurrection of Jesus, as given in "The Desire
of Ages," pages 779-782.
                THE IMPREGNABLE FOUNDATION OF CHRISTIANITY
    2. "While the literal bodily resurrection of Jesus Christ is the corner
stone of Christian 'doctrine, it is also the Gibraltar of Christian evidence,
and the Waterloo of infidelity and rationalism. If the Scriptural assertions
of Christ's resurrection can be established as historic certainties, the claims
and doctrines of Christianity rest upon an impregnable foundation."-"The
Fundamentals," volume 5, page 82.
                     THE CHURCH AND THE RESURRECTION
     3. "The most convincing argument for the resurrection is to be found
in the history of the church. 'The real historical evidence for the resurrec-
tion is the fact that it was believed, preached, propagated, and produced its
fruit and effect in the new phenomenon of the Christian church long before
any of our Gospels were written.' "-"The Incarnation," page 60.
                    THE PROMINENCE OF THE RESURRECTION
  ' 4. "The resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead is the corner stone of
Christian doctrine. It is mentioned directly one hundred and four or more
times in the New Testament. It was the most prominent and cardinal point
in the apostolic testimony."-"The Fundamentals," volume 5, page 81.

                            Synopsis
    SEED THOUGHT: "By His humanity, Christ touched hu-
manity; by His divinity, He lays hold upon the throne of
God."—"The Desire of Ages," page 24.
    1. In the epistle to the Hebrews; there is presented to, us
the reality of all that,was set forth in type and shadow in the
ancient tabernacle service. The central and most important
feature of this interpretation is the fact that "Jesus the Son
of God" is now our high priest, the minister of the heavenly
sanctuary. Heb. 4: 14; 8: 1, 2. We shall therefore study con-
cerning Christ our priest as He is interpreted to us in the
epistle to the Hebrews.
    2. It was because of what Jesus was in His own person
that He could act as the mediator and priest for sinful men.
Therefore we first learn in the epistle to the Hebrews who
and what He was, as the necessary introduction to the reve-
lation concerning His priesthood. .
    3. There is much significance in the name first used of
Him who is afterwards declared to be "a merciful and faith-
ful high priest." He is no ordinary son, but Son of God (Heb.
1: 2), who is "heir of all things," and the agent in creation,
a proof of both His preexistence and His deity. He is in Him-
self a revelation of the glory of God, and "the impress of His
substance." Verse 3, A. R. V., margin. By His word, He sus-
tains all things; and on account of His deity as thus shown;
He is able to deal successfully with sin. He is now seated in
the place of honor in heaven. He bears "a more excellent
name" than the angels (verse 4) , since God is His Father,
and He is the Son of God (verse 5). Furthermore, the angels
do Him homage. Verse 6.
    4. The angels are God's administrative agents (Heb. 1: 7),
but the Son is Himself God and King (verse 8). He is the
Lord of creation (verse 10), whose works may perish, but He
is eternal (verse 11).
    5. He who is introduced to us in the first chapter as Son,
 God, and Lord, whose deity and eternity are emphasized,
14         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

meets us in the second chapter as the Son of man, with all the
limitations of our common humanity. He is known now by
His earthly, personal name, and as one who can taste of death
 (Pleb. 2: 9), and can be made "perfect through sufferings"
 (verse 10). He partook of the same flesh and blood which we
have (verse 14), becoming just as truly man (verse 17) as He
is truly God. It was this union of humanity with divinity
which enabled Him to become "a merciful and faithful high
priest." Verse 17. His experience of temptation as a man
has prepared Him to minister sympathy and help to the
tempted. Verse 18.
    6. Because oil/. High Priest is the eternal Son of God, He
is "able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or
think" (Eph. 3: 20) ; and because He is the Son of man, He
is "touched with the feeling of our infirmities" (Heb. 4: 15)..
He is in Himself "the appointed place of meeting between God
and humanity." No one is prepared to act as priest who does
not combine in his own person divinity and humanity, as set
forth in the first two chapters of Hebrews; and this fact ex-
cludes all merely human priests, such as are found in the
Roman Catholic system.

    "Christ's mediatorial office in the physical creation was the starting-point
of the apostle's teaching, His mediatorial office in the spiritual creation is
its principal theme. . . . If the function of Christ is unique in the universe,
so it is also in the church. He is the sole and absolute link between God
and humanity. Nothing short of His personality would suffice as a medium
of reconciliation between the two. Nothing short of His life and work in
the flesh, as consummated in His presence, would serve as an assurance of
God's love and pardon."-"The One Mediator," page 24.

    SEED THOUGHT: "In. the Scriptures the figure of the erec-
tion of a temple is frequently used to illustrate the building
of the church."-"The Acts of the Apostles," page 595.
16          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

     "By His sacrifice and mediation, Christ is both the foun-
dation and the builder of the church of God."—"The Great
Controversy," page 416.
     1. After Peter had made the great confession which con-
stitutes the very foundation of Christianity (Matt. 16: 16),
recognizing that there was in Jesus the union of divinity and
humanity, Christ declared that upon that rock foundation He
would build His church (verse 18). The church of God is the
house of God. 1 Tim. 3: 15. This is a spiritual house built
up with living stones, that is, members of the church. 1 Peter
2: 5. According to the prophecy of Zechariah, this structure
was to be built by "the man whose name is THE BRANCH,"
officiating as a priest. Zech. 6: 12, 13.
     2. In harmony with this view of the work of Christ as
priest, He is first presented to us in the epistle to the Hebrews
as both the Son of God and the Son of man (chapters 1 and
2), uniting in Himself divinity and humanity; and then the
first phase of His official ministry to which our attention is
directed is His building that spiritual house of God which in-
cluded Moses. Heb. 3: 3. We may therefore profitably con-
sider how our High Priest builds the temple of the Lord.
     3. When David suggested that he would like to build a
house for the ark of God, he was told by the prophet Nathan
that the Lord would make him a house (2 Sam. 7: 11), and
this was accompanied by the assurance that his house should
be "established forever" (verse 16). In his prayer of re-
sponse 'to this promise of God to him, David asked that the
Lord bless his house, that it might "continue forever." Verse
29. It is death which prevents a house or family from con-
tinuing (Heb. 7: 23) , and death is in consequence of sin
 (Rom. 6: 23). In order that a house may continue forever,
it is therefore necessal7 to put away sin. This is the blessing
which the Son was sent to confer (Acts 3: 26), and it is ac-
complished in His ministry as a priest through the sacrifice
of Himself (Heb. 9: 25, 26).
     4. A house or family is built up by having children born
into the family. Ruth 4: 11. In order that the house of David
might be built up and continue forever, the eternal Son of God
"was born of the seed of David" (Rom. 1: 3, A. R. V.), and
so became the Son of David (Matt. 1: 1). A divine-human
order of being was in this way established. In order that sin-
ful men may share in this new order of being, and their life
measure with the life of God, they must be born again (John
3: 3), of the Spirit (verse 5), "created in Christ Jesus" (Eph.
2: 10), thus putting on Christ (Rom. 13: 14).
     5. As priest upon the throne, "the man whose name is
THE BRANCH" pours out the Holy Spirit (Acts 2: 33), ac-
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                17

cording to His promise (John 15: 26), and thus imparts His
own life (John 14: 19). This is possible because He has been
made priest "after the power of an endless life." Heb. 7: 16.
Through the ministry of this creative Spirit, the image of God
is renewed in the souls of those who believe on Christ; they
become members of the household of God (Eph. 2: 19), indi-
vidually the "temple of the Holy Spirit" (1 Cor. 6: 19, A.
R. V.), and collectively "an habitation of God" (Eph. 2: 22).
    6. In this way, our High Priest builds the house of God,-
"whose house are we." Heb. 3: 6.
                           Questions
    1. What was Peter's •confession concerning Christ? and
what did he thus recognize? Matt. 16: 16.
    2. What statement did Christ make, based upon this con-
fession? Verse 18.
    3. What is the church of God declared to be? 1 Tim. 3: 15.

   12. What is the cause of death? Rom. 6: 23.
   13. If a house is to continue, what must be done?

   15. How has He put away sin? Heb. 9: 25, 26.
   16. How is a house or family built up? Ruth 4: 11.

                        THE DIVINE-HUMAN BUILDER
    1. Ad a prophet, Moses was a type of Christ (Deut. 18:15) ; but the im-
measurable superiority of Christ over Moses ,s shown in His work as a
builder of the house of which Moses was a part. Only He who unites di-
vinity and humanity in His own person could be the builder of such a house.
                         "WHOSE HOUSE ARE WE"
    2. "The true house, the true dwelling of God, is His people. In Christ
we are builded together for a habitation of God in the Spirit. Of the
church, as His body, of the individual soul, Christ says: 'We will come and
make our abode.' It is the characteristic of spiritual things that each part
is also a living whole. Collectively and individually we are Christ's house:
he that would know the faithfulness of Christ in His house, must yield him-
self to be His house, must allow Christ as Son over His house to be master,
to have the keys alone, to hold undisturbed possession and rule."—"The
Holiest of All," page 109.

     SEED THOUGHT: "Now consider how great this man was,
unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the
spoils. . . . And without all contradiction the less is blessed
of the better." Heb. 7: 4, 7.
    1. Melchizedek is mentioned in three different ways in the
Bible: in history, as both priest and king (Gen. 14: 18), this
being the first mention of a priest in the Scriptures; in
prophecy (Ps. 110: 4), as determining the order of Christ's
priesthood; in fulfillment (H,ebrews 7), where both the his-
torical and the prophetical mention are expounded and ap-
plied in their relation to Christ.
             SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   19
     2. Christ did not assume the office of priest, but became
  priest by the appointment of God, according to a statement
 which suggests both the incarnation and the resurrection.
  Heb. 5: 5. ,Compare Luke 1: 32; Heb. 2: 16, 17; Acts 13: 33.
  Here the fact is again emphasized that the priesthood of
  Christ is based upon, and grows out of, His unique relation to
  God as the only begotten Son, arising from His inherent na-
  ture rather than from a merely arbitrary choice. In view of
 such a preparation for this intercessory work, He is definitely
 commissioned as a priest, and the order of His priesthood is
  announced. Heb. 5: 6.
     3. The priests of the Levitical system, taken as a whole,
  were a type of the prieSthood of Christ (Heb. 8: 4, 5), but
  His order as priest is that of Melchizedek (Heb. 5: 10). A
  distinguishing feature of the priesthood of Melchizedek is
  that he is set forth as having neither "beginning of days, nor
  end of life" (Gen. 14: 18-20), thus being a typical representa-
.tive of the eternal Son of God (Heb. 7: 3), whose priesthood
  did not depend upon His genealogy, but upon the eternity of
  His being (verses 15, 16).
     4. It is further to be noted that Melchizedek was both king
  and priest (Heb. 7: 1), in which respect he differed from the
  Levites, and that his name signifies "king of righteousness."
  Christ, our priest "after the order of Melchizedek," is "a priest
  upon His throne" (Zech. 6: 13; Heb. 8: 1), which is "the
  throne of grace" (Heb. 4: 16). So also is Christ's kingdom a
  kingdom of righteousness and peace. Rom. 14: 17. Compare
  Heb. 1: 8, 9.
      5. Three times in the epistle to the Hebrews it is affirmed
  of Christ that He is "a priest forever." Heb. 5: 6; 7: 17, 21.
  Upon the eternity of His being and the continuance of His
  priesthood rests our hope of a complete salvation through His
  constant intercession. Heb. 7: 24, 25.

                    DIVINITY AND HUMANITY COMBINED
    "In Christ, divinity and humanity were combined. Divinity was not
degraded to humanity ; divinity held its place, but humanity, by being
united to divinity, withstood the fiercest test of temptation in the wilder-
ness. . . . Man may become a partaker of the divine nature ; not a soul
lives who may not summon the aid of Heaven in temptation and trial.
Christ came to reveal the Source of His power, that man might never rely
on his unaided human capabilities.
    "Those who would overcome must put to the tax every power of their
being. They must agonize on their knees before God for divine power.
Christ came to be our example, and to make known to us that we may be
partakers of the divine nature. . . . Men may have a power to resist evil —
a power that neither earth, nor death, nor hell can master ; a power that
will place them where they may overcome as Christ overcame. Divinity
and humanity may be combined in them. . .
    "It was Christ that spoke through Melchizedek, the priest of the most
high God. Melchizedek was not Christ, but he was the voice of God in the
world, the representative of the Father. And all through the generations
of the past, Christ has spoken; Christ has led His people, and has been the
light of the world."— Mrs. E. G. White. in "Review and Herald," February
18, 1890.

                   •        Synopsis
    SEED THOUGHT: "The need of man, in one word, was me-
  diation; the work of Christ is that of mediator."—"The In-
  carnation," page 39.
      1. One of the key words of the epistle to the Hebrews is
  "better." Seven better things are mentioned. Heb. 7: 19;
  8: 6; 9:23; 10: 34; 11: 16, 35. Fundamental among these
  better things is the better covenant, since it has such a direct
  bearing upon personal Christian experience.
'     2. A new covenant implies an old covenant (Heb. 8: 13),
  and better promises (verse 6) imply that the old covenant was
  established upon promises which failed of being fulfilled.
  The old covenant was a mutual agreement based upon the
  promises of God and His people, but the promise of God was
  conditioned upon the promise of the people. Ex. 19: 5, 6, 8.
  The failure of the people to keep their promise (Ex. 32: 1-6)
  released God from His obligation under, that particular
  covenant.
     3. The new covenant is not a mutual agreement, but con-
  sists of unconditional promises on the part of God, and it is
  therefore entirely different from the old covenant. Jer..31:
  31, 32. That a covenant of grace is a promise is shown by
  the fact that the covenant with Abraham is also called a
  promise. Gal. 3: 17. So the apostle Paul refers to "the cove-
  nants of promise." Eph. 2: 12.
      4. Three definite promises are found in the new covenant.
  Heb. 8: 10-12. Since Christ is the mediator of the new cove-
  nant, He is the mediator of these "better promises." Verse 6.
  These "better promises" are really a summary of the promise
  of salvation made from the beginning. Thus the covenant of
  grace was first set forth in Eden (Gen. 3: 15) , renewed to
  Abraham (Gen. 15: 18) in the promise of the land, and con-
  firmed to Isaac and Jacob (Ps. 105: 8-11). This covenant was
  further developed in the promise of the throne to the seed of
  David. 2 Sam. 7: 12, 13; Isa. 55: 3. But these promises are
  all made, not to separate individuals, but to one described as
  the seed, first of the woman, then of ,Abraham, and then of
22          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

David. But this seed is Christ, born of a woman (Gal. 4: 4),
the Son of David and Abraham (Matt. 1: 1). In and through
Christ the Seed, the Son of man, will therefore be fulfilled all
the promises which constitute God's covenant of grace. 2 Cor.
1: 19, 20. Those who believe on Him and are found "in Him"
 (Phil. 3: 9), and are members of His body (1 Cor. 12: 27),
will share in all the benefits of these promises which are thus
mediated to them by Christ.
    5. The law was within the heart of Christ (Ps. 40: 7, 8),
who always did the will of God (John 6: 38) and kept His
Father's commandments (John 15: 10). When we are "created
in Christ Jesus" (Eph. 2: 10), and He dwells in our heart
(Eph.      17), the law will be written there, and fulfilled in
the life (Rom. 8: 3, 4).
                           Questions
    1. What is one of the key words of the epistle to the He-
brews? See synopsis, paragraph 1, first part.
    2. What better things are spoken of in this epistle? Heb.
7: 19; 8: 6; 9:23; 10: 34; 11: 16, 35.
    3. What is implied by the expression "a new covenant"?
Heb. 8: 13.
    4. What is implied by "better promises" of the new cove-
nant? Verse 6.
    5. In the old covenant, upon what was the promise of God
conditioned? Ex. 19: 5, 6, 8.                      •
    6. What released God from His obligation under this par-
ticular covenant? Ex. 32: 1-6.
    7.- In what way does the new covenant differ from the old?
Jer. 31: 31, 32.
    8. What shows that a covenant of grace is a promise of
God? Gal. 3: 17.
    9. What other inspired expression teaches the same thing?
Eph. 2: 12.
   10. What promises are found in the new covenant? Heb.
8: 10-12.
   11. Since these promises constitute the covenant, of what is
Christ the mediator? Verse 6.
   12. Of what are these three promises the summary? See
synopsis, paragraph 4.
   13. In what promise was the covenant of grace first made?
Gen. 3: 15.
   14. To whom was this covenant renewed? Gen. 15: 18.
   15. To whom was it confirmed? Ps. 105: 8-11.
   16. In what promise was this covenant further developed?
2 Sam. 7: 12, 13; Isa. 55: 3.

                                  Notes
                            THE BETTER PROMISES
   1. "'The new covenant' was established upon 'better promises,'— the
promise of forgiveness of sins, and of the grace of God to renew the heart,
and bring it into harmony with the principles of' God's law."—"Patriarchs
and Prophets," page 372.
                        THE SAME LAW IN THE HEART
   2. "The same law that was engraved upon the tables of stone, is written
by the Holy Spirit upon the tables of the heart. Instead of going about to
establish our own righteousness,. we accept the righteousness of Christ. His
blood atones for our sins. His obedience is accepted for us. Then the heart
renewed by the Holy Spirit will bring forth 'the fruits of the Spirit.'
Through the grace of Christ we shall live in obedience to the law of God
written upon our hearts."—Ibid.
                        THE NEW COVENANT DEFINED
   3. "Though this [new] covenant was made with Adam and renewed to
Abraham, it could not be ratified until the death of Christ. It had existed
by the promise of God since the first intimation of redemption had been
given ; it had been accepted by faith ; yet when ratified by Christ, it is
called a new covenant. The law of God was the basis of this covenant,
which was simply an arrangement for bringing men again into harmony
with the divine will, placing them where they could obey God's law."—Id.,
pages 370, 371,
                           THE COVENANT OF GRACE
   4. "From the beginning, God, and Christ knew of the apostasy of Satan,
and of the fall of man through the deceptive power of the apostate. God
did not ordain that sin should exist, but He foresaw its existence, and made
provision to meet the terrible emergency. So great was His love for the
world, that He covenanted to give His only begotten Son 'that whosoever
believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.' "—"The De-,
sire of Ages," page 22.
   5. "Israel began well, and accepted the covenant, and promised obedience.
But they continued not. There was no power to continue ; no power to
conquer temptation, or the evil heart ; to remain faithful. Against this the
new covenant would provide, because it was better, enacted in better
promises. It would, by the blood of Christ, provide such an actual putting
away and cleansing of sin that God would actually remember them no more
forever. With this He would, by His Holy Spirit, so put His laws ihto their
heart that they should delight in doing them. God would Himself work both
to will and to do. And then, in this power of Christ's blood and the re-
newal of the Holy Spirit, they would no longer be dependent on men for
their knowledge of God, but have direct access and direct intercourse with
Him."—"The Holiest of All," pages 268, 269.

                            Synopsis
    SEED THOUGHT: "We must present the law and the gospel
together, for they go hand in hand."—"Gospel Workers,"
 page 161.
    1. Through the law comes the knowledge of sin (Rom.
3: 20) ; and where there is no law, there is no sin (Rom.
5: 13). The gospel is the good tidings concerning the Son of
God (Rom. 1: 1, 3), who came into the world as its Saviour
 (Luke 2: 10, 11), to save from sin (Matt. 1: 21), which is the
transgression of the law (1 John 3: 4).
    2. By making known sin to us, the law, by which We can-
not be justified (Rom. 3: 20), conducts us to Christ (Gal.
3: 24), that we may be justified through faith in Him (Gal.
2: 16). Thus Christ becomes the aim of the law. Rom. 10: 4.
    3. In the law is the form of the truth (Rom. 2: 20) ; but
in Christ, who is Himself the truth (John 14: 6), we have the
reality (John 1: 17), and the, power (1 Cor. 1: 24) by which
to bring into our experience the truth in Jesus (Eph. 4: 21).
    4. The law reveals sin (Rom. 7: 7), and demands a right-
eousness (Rom. 2: 26) which it is not able to provide (Gal.
2: 21; 3: 21), but to which it witnesses when it is manifested
(Rom. 3: 21). In the gospel, God's righteousness is unvei
(Rom. 1: 16, 17), a free gift (Rom. 5: 17), conferred through
faith in Christ (Rom. 3: 22), who is Himself made to us
righteousness (1 Cor. 1: 30).
    5. The principle underlying the law is love (Matt. 22:
36-40; Gal. 5: 14), and to love is therefore to fulfill the law
(Rom. 13: 8-10). This love extends even to our enemies
(Matt. 5:44), and is godlike in its nature (1 Cor. 13: 4-7,
A. R. V.). This love has been manifested in the gospel (John
3: 16; 1 John 4: 9), revealing the character of God (1 John
4: 8), and is conveyed to us through the gift of the Holy
Spirit (Rom. 5: 5)', which is ministered to us by Christ, our
priest in the heavenly sanctuary (Heb. 8: 1; Acts 2: 33).
This love is manifested by us in obedience to the law of God.
1 John 5: 3. Thus the requirement of the law is fulfilled in
              SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                 25.
    us (Rom. 8: 3, 4), and we "become the righteousness of God"
    in Christ (2 Cor. 5: 21, A. R. V.).
        6. All the demands of a holy law (Rom. 7: 12) are thus
    met in and through the gospel of Christ, and "we have been
    discharged from the law" through our fellowship with Christ
, in His death (Rom. 7: 6, A. R. V.).
                             Questions
      1. What is made known to us through the law? Rom.
  3: 20, A. R. V.

  1: 1, 3.

  makes it known? 1 John 3: 4.

                                  Notes
                   THE LAW AS • A CONDUCTOR TO CHRIST
    1. "'The law bath been our paidagogos for Christ' [Gal. 3:24]. This
Greek word (boy-leader) has no English equivalent; we have not the thing
it represents. The 'pedagogue' was a sort of nursery governor,— a confi-
dential servant in the Greek household, commonly a slave, who had charge
of the boy from his infancy, and was responsible for his oversight. In his
food, his clothes, his home lessons, his play, his walks — at every point the
pedagogue was required to wait upon his young charge, and to control his
movements. Amongst other offices, his tutor might have to conduct the boy
to school."—"The Epistle to the Galatians" (Findlay), pages 224, 225.
                   THE IMPUTED RIGHTEOUSNESS OF CHRIST
    2. This subject is beautifully set forth in "Steps to Christ," under the
chapter heading, "The Test cf Discipleship."
            THE COMMANDMENTS OF GOD AND THE FAITH OF JESUS
    3. "As a power from beneath is stirring up the children of disobedience
to make void the law of God, and to trample upon the truth that Christ is
our righteousness, a power from above is moving upon the hearts of those
who are loyal, to exalt the law, and to lift up Jesus as a complete Saviour.
Unless divine power is brought into the experience of the people of God,
false theories and ideas will take minds captive, Christ and His righteous-
ness will be dropped out of the experience of many, and their faith will be
without power or life. . . .
    "The offering of Cain was an offense to God, because it was a Christless
offering. The burden of our message is not only the commandments of God,
but the faith of Jesus. A bright light shines upon our pathway to-day, and
it leads to increased faith in Jesus. We must receive every ray of light, and
walk in it, that it may not be our condemnation in the Judgment."—"Gos-
pel Workers," pages 161, 162.

                          Synopsis
    SEED THOUGHT: "Remission, or putting away of sin, is
the work to be accomplished."—"The Great Controversy,"
page 418.
   1. On the typical day of atonement, the people and the
sanctuary were cleansed from sin (Lev. 16: 30, 33, 34), by
sprinkling blood before the mercy seat in the most holy place
 (verses 14-16). The life of all flesh is the blood (Lev. 17:
14) ; and for this reason, the blood was used in the typical
service of atonement (verse 11). The shedding of blood was
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   27

necessary for cleansing or remission (Heb. 9: 22), as is shown
by its use in the typical service; but the heavenly sanctuary
itself requires better %sacrifices for its cleansing (verse 23),
even the sacrifice of Christ (verses 25, 26), whose blood
cleanses from sin (verse 14; 1 John 1: 7).
     2. The work of Christ as our high priest in the heavenly
sanctuary is one of the doctrinal pillars of this advent move-
ment. The light upon this subject explained the disappoint-
ment of those who looked for the coming of Christ in 1844,
and furnished the solid basis for the threefold message which
should develop a people keeping the commandments of God
and the faith of Jesus.
    3. The statement was made in the hearing of the prophet
Daniel, that at the end of the 2300 days, or years, the sanc-
tuary would be cleansed. Dan. 8: 13, 14. Then would com-
mence the antitypical day of atonement, when Christ our
priest would enter upon His work in the second apartment
of the heavenly sanctuary, according to the type (Heb. 9: 7),
making atonement, by His own blood, for those who had ac-
cepted Him as their Saviour, and receiving the kingdom in
their behalf (Dan. 7: 13, 14). The removal of sins from the
tabernacle in the typical service, by confessing them upon the
head of the scapegoat and sending him away into the wilder-
ness (Lev. 16: 20-22), finds its fulfillment in the cleansing of
the heavenly sanctuary in the antitypical day of atonement,
and the blotting out of sin. This is the closing phase of the
ministry of Christ in behalf of sinners; and while it is being
accomplished, a people are made ready by a message given in
 the spirit and power of Elias (Luke 1: 17),— prepared for the
 Lord, who has promised to return for them (John 14: 2, 3).
     4. The typical day of atonement was a time of great so-
 lemnity, when the people were to afflict their souls. Lev.
23: 26-28. Those who did not so regard it were to be cut off.
 Verse 29. This necessarily involved a work of discriminating
 and judging. So the judgment hour message marks the close
 of the 2300 days, or years, and the commencement of the
 antitypical day of atonement. Rev. 14: 6, 7.
     5. As the typical service had special reference to the law
 of God written upon the tables of stone and deposited in the
 ark in the most holy place,•so in the antitypical day of atone-
 ment, the attention of the people is directed to the law of God,
 and the people prepared to meet the Lord are those who keep
 the commandments (Rev. 14: 12) , as Jesus did (John 15: 10).
 Two things must therefore be especially emphasized in this
 advent movement: the cleansing of the sanctuary and of the
  people from sin, and a Christlike life which can meet all the
  requirements of the law of God. James 2: 8-12.

                                    Notes
                     THE GOSPEL OF THE TYPICAL SERVICE
      1. "Important truths concerning the atonement are taught by the typical
   service. A substitute was accepted in the sinner's stead ; but the sin was
   not canceled by the blood of the victim. A means was thus provided by
   which it was transferred to the sanctuary. By the offering of blood, the
   sinner acknowledged• the authority of the law, confessed his guilt in trans-
   gression, and expressed his desire for pardon through faith in a Redeemer
   to come; but he was not yet entirely released from the condemnation of the
   law. On the day of atonement the high priest, having taken an offering
   from the congregation, went into the most holy place with the blood of this
   offering, and sprinkled it upon the mercy seat, directly over the law, to
   make satisfaction ,for its claims. Then, in his character of mediator, he
   took the sins upon himself and bore them from the sanctuary. Placing his
   hands upon the head of the scapegoat, he confessed over him all these sins,
   thus in figure transferring them from himself to the goat. The goat then
   bore them away and they were regarded as forever separated from the
   people. Such was the service performed 'unto the example and shadow of
   heavenly things.' And what was done in type in the ministration of the
   earthly sanctuary, is done in reality in the ministration of the heavenly
   sanctuary."—"The Great Controversy," page 420.
                        THE ATONEMENT NOT COMPLETED
s'    2. "One of the most complete types of the history 'of redemption is to be
 • found in the ceremonies of the day of atonement. It was an essential part
   of the work of the high priest on that day that he should come forth from
   within the veil, and laying aside his linen garments, reappear to bless the
   waiting congregation. Our great High Priest is now within the veil. He
. has offered the atoning sacrifice on the altar of Calvary, and with the merit
 .of that sacrifice He has gone in to appear in the presence of God for ,us.
   But the great day of atonement is not yet closed. When His work within
   the veil is ended, He shall come forth, arrayed again in His garments of
   glory and beauty, for the final blessing of His waiting people. 'Having
   been once offered to bear the sins of many, He shall appear a second time,
   apart from sin, to them that wait for Him, unto salvation.' "—"The Funda-
   mentals," volume 6, page 122.
                       INTERPRETATION OF THE 2300 DAYS
     3. "The 2300 days had been found to begin when the commandment of
 Artaxerxes for the restoration and building of Jerusalem, went into effect,
 in the autumn of B. c. 457. Taking this as the starting point, there was
 perfect harmony in the application of all the events foretold in the expla-
 nation of that period in Dan. 9: 25-27. Sixty-nine weeks, the first 483 of
 the 2300 years, were to reach to the Messiah, the Anointed One; and Christ's
 baptism and anointing by the Holy Spirit, A. D. 27, exactly fulfilled the
 specification. In the midst of the seventieth week, Messiah was to be cut
 off. Three and a half years after His baptism, Christ was crucified, in the
 spring of A. D. 31. The seventy weeks, or 490 years, were to pertain espe-
 cially to the Jews. At the expiration of this period, the nation sealed its
 rejection of Christ by the persecution of His disciples, and the apostles
 turned to the gentiles, A. D. 34. The first 490 years of the 2300 having then
 ended, 1810 years would remain.• From A. D. 34, 1810 years extend to 1844.
 'Then,' said the angel, 'shall the sanctuary be cleansed.' All the preceding
 specifications of the prophecy had been unquestionably fulfilled at the' time
 appointed."—"The Great Controversy," page 410.
                        THE SANCTUARY OF DANIEL 8 :14
     4. "The term 'sanctuary,' as used in the Bible, refers, first, to the taber-
 nacle built by Moses, as a pattern of heavenly things ; and, secondly, to the
 'true tabernacle' in heaven, to which the earthly sanctuary pointed. At the
 death of Christ the typical service ended. The 'true tabernacle' in heaven
30             SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

is the sanctuary of the new covenant. And as the prophecy of Dan. 8:14
is fulfilled in this dispensation, the sanctuary to which it refers must be the
sanctuary of the new covenant. At the termination of the 2300 days, in
1844, there had been no sanctuary on earth for many centuries. Thus the
prophecy, 'Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanc-
tuary be cleansed,' unquestionably points to the sanctuary in heaven."—Id.,
page 417.

                             Synopsis
    SEED THOUGHT: "While Romanism is based upon decep-
tion, it is not a coarse and clumsy imposture."—"The Great
Controversy," page 566.
    1. The central feature of the gospel is the mediatorial
work of Christ for sin, and the most vital fact of this media-
torial work is that we have such a high priest as is fore-
shadowed in the typical system, who is.now at the right hand
of God, a minister of the heavenly sanctuary. Heb. 8: 1, 2.
    2. The mystery of godliness .was made manifest in Christ,
in whom divinity and humanity were united. 1 Tim. 3: 16.
Before He ascended to heaven, He promised that His presence
should continue with His disciples' (Matt. 28:20), and He
made provision for this in the coming of the Holy Spirit, the
Comforter. (John 14: 16-18), who is His representative.
    3. Gross idolatry was' characteristic of ancient Babylon
(Jer. 50: 38)'; and from the time of leaving Egypt (Ex. 32:
1-6), during their conquest of the promised land (Ps. 106:
34-38), and especially during the reign of Solomon (1 Kings
11: 5-7), the children of Israel were led into idolatry. Pagan-
ism flourished during the time of the four great world em-
pires; but the paganism of the Roman empire was overthrown
toward the end of the fourth century, so far as its official
recognition was concerned. Then the mystery of iniquity,
which was already working in the time of the apostle Paul
(2 Thess. 2: 7), rapidly developed into the full papal system
under the headship of the man of sin (verses 3, 4).
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   31

    4. The pope of Rome is declared to be the visible repre-
sentative of Christ upon earth, thus usurping the place of the
Holy Spirit, the Comforter; and he also bears the title "Ponti-
fex Maximus," or chief priest, a purely pagan title. He is
thus the head of the Roman priesthood, all the authority of
every rank below him being derived from him.
    5. In the Roman system of mediation, an earthly sanctu-
ary is substituted for the heavenly; a visible priest for the
invisible Priest in heaven (Heb. 8: 1, 2) ; a visible wafer, pur-
porting to be the real body and blood of Christ through the
process known as transubstantiation, is submitted for
Christ, the true sacrifice (Heb. 7: 27) ; and the law of the
church is substituted for the law of the Ten Commandments
in the ark in the most holy place of the heavenly sanctuary.
This is a system of idolatry; paganism under the forms of
Christianity. The claim is made that the Roman Catholic
Church alone supplies the means for fellowship with Christ,
whereas, as a matter of fact, it interposes a human barrier
between Christ and the sinner. While professing to be a ful-
fillment of the ancient typical system of mediation, it is in
reality a counterfeit of the true system of which Christ is
the head.
    6. The New Testament prophecy declares that the system
of lawlessness, the "man of sin," would so set forth man in
the place of God, the human in place of the divine. 2 Thess.
2: 4. The prophecy of Daniel shows this power casting the
truth to the ground, and prospering in its course of opposition
to God. Dan. 8: 12. But at the end of the 2300 days, this
second advent movement arose, which gives to Christ His
rightful place as our great high priest, and directs attention
to His work in the cleansing of the sanctuary, thus exposing
the counterfeit introduced by the papacy, and restoring to
the people the blessings bestowed through the mediation of
Christ. Dan. 8: 13, 14.

                                   Notes
                        THE MANIFESTATION OF A PERSON
   1. "Just as the 'mystery of godliness' is not merely the manifestation of
the system of godliness, but the manifestation of God Himself, so the 'mys-
tery of iniquity' is not merely the manifestation of the system of iniquity,
but the manifestation of the person or author of iniquity. The prophecy
brings before us two mysteries, the one the counterfeit in all points of the
other. We have an invisible agent, even God, beneath the one ; we have an
invisible agent, even Satan, beneath the other."-"The Papacy Is the Anti-
christ," page 26.
                         THE REPRESENTATIVES OF SATAN
   2. "Christianity became corrupted. Popes and priests presumed to take
an exalted position, and taught the people to look to them for the pardon of
their sins, instead of looking to Christ for themselves. The people were wholly
deceived. They were taught that the popes and priests were Christ's repre-
sentatives, when in fact they were the representatives of Satan, and those
who bowed to them, worshiped Satan."-"Early Writings," pages 213, 214.
              SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                            33
                  THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MAN OF SIN
    3. The gradual development of the "man of sin" is described in "The
Great Controversy," pages 49, 50. None should fail to read it.
            THE PAPACY A COMPLETE FALSE SYSTEM OF ITS OWN
    4. "Popery has a god of its own. . . . It has a savior of its own — the
church, to wit. It has n sacrifice of its own — the mass. .It has a mediator
of its own — the priesthood. It has a sanctifier of its own — the sacrament.
It has a justification of its own — that even of infused righteousness. It
has a pardon of its own — the pardon of the confessional ; and it has in the
heavens an infallible, all-prevailing advocate unknown' to the gospel — the
`mother of God.' It thus presents to the world a spiritual and saving ap-
paratus for the salvation of men, and yet it neither sanctifies nor saves any
one. It looks like a church ; it professes to have all that a church ought
to have ; and yet, it is not a church. It is a grand deception —'the all-
deceivableness of unrighteousness.' "—"The Papacy Is the Antichrist,"
pages 88, 89.
   THE TRUE AND THE COUNTERFEIT CHURCH BOTH REST UPON A PERSON
   5. "That 'Christ is the Son of God' is the corner stone of the gospel
church. Out of that root the whole gospel springs. It is the 'rock' on which
Christ, addressing Peter, said that He would build His church.
   "That the 'pope is the vicar of Christ' is the corner stone of the papal
church. Out of that root does the whole of popery spring. On that 'rock,'
said Boniface III in the seventh century, and Gregory VII, with yet greater
emphasis, in the eleventh, will I build my church."— Id., page 89.

                             Synopsis
    SEED THOUGHT: "If      Christ is dwelling in our hearts, He
will work in us 'both to will and to do of His good pleas-
ure.' "—"Steps to Christ," page 80.
    1. It is the aim of the threefold message of Rev. 14: 6-12
to bring out a people who shall do the will of God as expressed
in His law. It is therefore important that we should clearly
understand how this result is to be attained.
    2. In this experience, Christ is both our example and our
power. Let us consider Him first as our example. Before
He came to this world, His attitude toward the will of God
was the subject of prophecy. Ps. 40: 7, 8. While here upon
the earth, Christ expressed Himself very emphatically con-
cerning this matter to His disciples (John 4: 34), and to the
Jews (John 5: 30). To the people, He declared it to be the
purpose for which He came down from heaven. John 6: 38.
34          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

To this purpose He adhered even when it involved His death.
Luke 22: 41, 42.
    3. In realizing His aim to do the will of God, Christ did
not depend upon any power inherent in Him as the Son of
God, but as an example to us, He trusted in another (Heb.
2: 13, first clause), and through His union with the Father,
the works were wrought in Him by the indwelling Father
 (John 14: 10). ' lie thus left us an example (1 Peter 2: 21),
teaching us how we ought to walk (1 John 2: 6).
    4. When man was created in the image of God (Gen.
1: 27), the law of God was written in his very being, and he
was endowed with such mental and moral power as enabled
him to reveal the will of God in his life. This was his crown
of glory and honor. Ps. 8: 5. Through sin, this power was
lost. Rom. 3: 23. God sent His own Son to become a man,
in order that through His experience, the righteous demand
of the law might be met in us. Rom. 8: 3, 4. The life that
He lived in His individual body here upon the earth, He now
imparts to those who believe in Him, ministering it to them
in the gift of the Holy Spirit (verse 2) ; and by thus dwelling
in their hearts (Eph. 3: 17), He writes the law of God here
according to the new covenant promise (Heb. 8: 10). This is
the new creation in the image of God. 2 Cor. 5: 17. Thus
through our personal union with Christ, God works in us
 (Phil. 2: 12, 13), making us perfect to do His will (Heb. 13:
20, 21) through Jesus Christ.
    5. The ritual service was unable to accomplish this work
 (Heb. 10: 1), since its sacrifices were the mere shadows of the
good things to come. But through the sacrifice which Christ
offered, both in His life of devotion to the will of God as a
man upon the earth, and in His death on the cross, He took
away the shadowy service, and established the reality of doing
God's will. Verses .8, 9.
    6. The secret of success in seeking to work the works of
God is to believe on Christ (John 6: 29), accepting Him as the
power of God (1 Cor. 1: 24), who will work in us mightily
 (Col. 1: 29).
                             Questions
    1. What is the aim of the threefold message of Rev.
14: 6-11?
    2. What will be said of such a people? Verse 12.
    3. What prophecy indicated what the attitude of Christ
toward the law of God would be? Ps. 40: 7, 8.
    4. How did He express Himself to His disciples concern-
ing this? John 4: 34.
    5. How did He express Himself to the Jews? John 5: 30.
    6. For what did He tell the people He came down from
heaven? John 6:38.

                            Synopsis
    SEED THOUGHT: "By His life and death, Christ has
achieved even more than recovery from the ruin wrought
through sin."—"The Desire of Ages," page 25.
    1. The entrance of sin interrupted the fellowship which
at first existed between God and man (Gen. 3: 8), and thus
brought a separation (Isa. 59: 2). Through the work of
Christ, this fellowship is renewed. 1 John 1: 3. In accom-
plishing this, the priestly ministry of Christ takes the first
place. By offering Himself as the sacrifice, He has put away
sin. Heb. 9: 26. By takine, our flesh, He has made a way
for us into the presence of God (Heb. 10: 19, 20) ; and through
His work as priest, we are urged to draw near to God (verses
21, 22).
    2. In His prayer just before His crucifixion, Jesus ex-
pressed the desire that His disciples might be with Him (John
17: 24), which was in harmony with His statement to them
that He would come again to receive them to Himself (John
14: 3). This desire will be realized when He comes again for
His people. 1 Thess. 4: 16, 17.
    3. Man was created in the image of God, and by virtue of
what he was, he could exercise dominion over the earth. Gen.
1: 26. When he lost that fellowship with God through sin, his
dominion passed to the god of this world. Luke 4: 6. It is
the work of Christ to make man a partaker of the divine na-
ture (2 Peter 1: 4), and in this way to restore the dominion
to him. This gospel of restoration was preached by Christ
when He healed a man with a withered hand (Matt. 12: 13),
and when He gave sight to a blind man" .(Mark 8: 25).
    4. The prophecy concerning Christ as the servant of the
Lord, spoke of Him as a restorer (Isa. 49: 6), as does also
the shepherd psalm (Ps. 23: 3). The prophecy concerning
the restoration of literal Jerusalem (Dan. 9: 25) was a
prophecy of the restoration of spiritual Jerusalem, the church.
After the resurrection, the disciples thought that possibly the
time had come for the restoration of the kingdom (Acts 1: 6) ;
but afterwards Peter taught that "the times of restoration of
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  37

all things" would be at the second advent (Acts 3: 20, 21,
A. R. V.) .
    5. It was Christ's work to bring men to God (1 Peter
3: 18), and this He did by bringing God to man in His own
person (Matt. 1:21-23; 2 Cor. 5: 19). As a result of His
work in behalf of men, "God Himself shall be with them."
Rev. 21:3.
    6. Sin means separation from God, and eternal death.
James 1: 15. By introducing sin and death into the world,
Satan hoped to defeat the purpose of God concerning man,
created in His own image, to be His representative in the
government of this world. Ps. 8: 3-8. By giving His only
begotten Son, not simply for us, but to us (Isa. 9: 6; Luke
2: 11), God brought divinity and humanity into direct union
 (1 Tim. 2: 5), and made us joint heirs with Christ (Rom.
8: 17) and joint rulers, not simply over this world, but over
all the domain of Christ (2 Tim. 2: 12; Luke 22: 29; Rev.
3: 21; Rom. 8: 32). Thus through the work of the last Adam,
we are lifted to a higher plane and to a closer relation with
God than was lost through the failure of the first Adam.

                                     Notes
                               PUTTING AWAY SIN
    1. "By the sacrifice of Himself He puts away sin. And now He offers
 us Himself to take the place of sin. He gives Himself, the Sacrificed One,
 who has finished redemption, to us to put away sin within us, too. It is
 as the Son, the Living One, that He is high priest : it is in eternal life
 power, by a life working in us, that He brings us to God. And so, by His
 Spirit, He, in His self-sacrifice, lives in us, and makes it true in the experi-
 ence of each true disciple — sin ,put away by the sacrifice of self. The law
 for the Head is the law for every member."—"The Holiest of All," pages
325, 826.
                        THE REDEMPTION OF THE EARTH
    2. "The earth originally given to man as his kingdoi1, betrayed by him
 into the hands of Satan, and so long held by the mighty foe, has been brought
 back by the great plan of redemption."—"The Great Controversy," page 64.
                        THE PRIVILEGES OF THE REDEEMED
     3. "All the treasures of the universe will be open to the study of God's
 redeemed. Unfettered by mortality, they wing their tireless flight to worlds
 afar,— worlds that thrilled with sorrow at the spectacle of human woe, and
 rang with songs of gladness at the tidings of a ransomed soul. With unut-
 terable delight the children of earth enter into the joy and the wisdom of
 unfallen beings. They share the treasures of knowledge and understanding
 gained through ages upon ages in contemplation of God's handiwork. With
 undimmed vision they gaze upon the glory of creation,— suns and stars and
 systems, all in their appointed order circling the throne of Deity. Upon all
 things, from the least to the greatest, the Creator's name is written, and in
 all are the riches of His power displayed."— Id., pages 677, 678.
