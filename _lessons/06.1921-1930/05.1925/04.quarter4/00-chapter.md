                    SETTING OF THE LESSON
    "On the journey through Galilee, Christ had again tried to
prepare the minds of His disciples for the scenes before Him.
. . . The disciples did not even now comprehend His words.
Although the shadow of a great sorrow fell upon them, a spirit
of rivalry found a place in their hearts. They disputed among
themselves which should be accounted greatest in the kingdom.
This strife they thought to conceal from Jesus, and they did not,
as usual, press close to His ,side, but loitered behind, so that He
was in advance of them as they entered Capernaum."—"The De-
sire of Ages," p. 432.

     is said concerning their angels? Verse 10. Note 7.
                                NOTES
    I. It was because the disciples were at strife among themselves
as to which of them should be greatest, that the real truth con-
cerning the events to occur at Jerusalem was hidden from them.
They might have known, but they still held to the cherished idea
of the Jewish people that the Messiah must establish a temporal
kingdom at Jerusalem. They were so occupied anticipating what
their place of authority might be in the new administration of
affairs, that they could not receive the unwelcome truth which
Jesus began to unfold to them regarding His sufferings and death.
    2. "This tribute was not a civil tax, but .a religious contribu-
tion, which every Jew was required to pay annually for the support
of the temple. A refusal to pay the tribute would be regarded
as-:disloyalty to•the femple,-r—in the estimation of: the irabbis.-a :most
grievous sin."—"The Desire of Ages;' PP:432; 433...
    3. "While the people of a country are- taxed for the main-
tenance of their king, the monarch's own children are exempt.
                                 [4I
So Israel, the professed people of God, were required to maintain
His service ; but Jesus, the Son of God, was under no such obli-
gation. If priests and Levites were exempt because of their con-
nection with the temple, how much more He to whom the temple
was His Father's house."—Id., P. 433.
    4. "If Jesus had paid the tribute without a protest, He would
virtually have acknowledged the justice of the claim, and would
thus have denied His divinity. But while He saw good to meet
the demand, He denied the claim upon which it was based. In
providing for the payment of the tribute He gave evidence of His
divine character. It was made manifest that He was one with
God, and therefore was not under tribute as a mere subject of
the kingdom."—id., P. 434.
    5. The word "offend" used here and elsewhere means cause to
stumble, and is so rendered in the Revised Version. It means
literally the placing of an impediment or trap before the feet so
as to cause one to stumble and fall.
    6. "One sin cherished is sufficient to work the degradation of
the character, and to mislead others. If the foot or the hand
would be cut off, or even the eye would be plucked out, to save
the body from death, how much more earnest should we be to
put away sin, that brings death to the soul."—"The Desire of
Ages," P. 439.
    "The surrender of the will is represented as plucking out the
eye or cutting off the hand. Often it seems to us that to surren-
der the will to God is to consent to go through life maimed or
crippled. But it is better, says Christ, for self to be maimed,
wounded, crippled, if thus you.may enter into life."—"Thoughts
 from the Mount of Blessing," pp. 95, 96, new edition.
    "Men of ten part with some members of the body, at the dis-
cretion of a surgeon, that they may preserve the trunk, and die
a little later; and yet they will not deprive themselves of a look,
a touch, a small pleasure, which endanger the eternal death of
the soul." "We must shut our senses against dangerous objects,
to avoid the occasions of sin, and deprive ourselves of all that is
most dear and profitable to us, in order to save our souls, when
we find that these dear and profitable things, however innocent in
themselves, cause us to sin against God."—Dr. Adam Clarke.
    7. "A guardian angel is appointed to every follower of Christ.
These heavenly watchers shield the righteous from the power of
the wicked one. . . . The angels appointed to minister to the
children of God have at all times access to His presence."—"The
Great Controversy," pp. 512, 513.

   The last time a Thirteenth Sabbath Offering was given to
India there was no overflow. This quarter we have an oppor-
tunity to help give the gospel to the countless multitudes
                                                         ' in South
India and Burma. Make your offering a liberal one, so there will
be a generous overflow.

                             LESSON 2
      GAINING THE BROTHER; RECKONING
               WITH SERVANTS
                         October 10, 1925.
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Matt. 18: 15-35.
MEMORY VERSE : Matt. 6; 15.

PERSONS: Jesus; Peter; probably all the disciples.

                    SETTING OF THE LESSON
   While Jesus was•with His disciples in a house in Capernaum,
He gave them some very practical teaching concerning their rela-
tion to others. "The rabbis limited the exercise of forgiveness to
three offenses. Peter,.carrying out, as he supposed, the teaching
of Christ, thought to extend it to seven, the number signifying
perfection."—"Christ's Object Lessons," P. 243.
                   Suggestions for Daily Family Study.

    7. Review the lesson by asking questions from the senior, youth's,
junior, or primary lesson. Discuss topics under the heading, "Some Things
to Think About," in the junior lesson.                               ,

                             QUESTIONS
 I.How are we to deal with a brother who sins against us?
   What do we gain if he hears us? Matt. 18: 15.
2. If our first effort toward reconciliation fails, what should
   we then do? Verse 16. Note 1.
3. Under what circumstances should the matter be brought
   to the church? If the judgment of the church is not heeded,
   how should the person be regarded? Verse 17. Note 2.
4. If this instruction be followed, how will God look upon the
   result? Verse 18.

14. How was this experience repeated? In what respect did
    the second experience differ from the first? Verses 28-30.
15. How was the king made acquainted with all that had occurred?
    Verse 31.
16. After calling the forgiven servant, what did his lord say to
    him? Verses 32, 33.
17. How are his lord's feelings described? How was the un-
    forgiying servant punished? Verse 34. Note 6.
18. What lesson did our Lord design we should learn from
    this parable? Verse 35. Note 7.
                               NOTES
       t. "GO and tell him his fault between thee and him alone."
  "If he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more."
  The Lord desires that alienation between brethren and all
           in the church should be kept within as small a circle as
  possible. "An earnest effort should be made in every church to
  put away evil-speaking and a censorious spirit as among the sins
  productive of the greatest evils in-the church. Severity and fault-
  finding must be rebuked as the workings of Satan. Mutual love
  and confidence must be encouraged and strengthened in the mem-
  bers of the church. Let all, in the fear of God and with love
  to their brethren, close their ears to gossip and censure."-"Testi-
  monies," vol. 5, p. 6o9.
       "If a brother is supposed to have erred, his brethren and
  sisters should not whisper it among themselves and comment upon
   it, magnifying these supposed errors and faults. Much of this
   work is Lane, and the result is, the displeasure of God rests upon
  jthose who do it, and Satan exults that he can weaken and annoy
   those who might be strong in the Lord."-Id., p. 615.
       2. The Lord here clearly teaches the neeessitj, of maintaining
   the purity and order of the church. When members have been
   separated frorri the church, our duty then, as Christians, is to
   continue to labor for their conversion, that they may again be
 . brought into the church - from which they have been separated.
.      3. Jesus' answer to Peter was broad enough to cover every
   case; for forgiveness, like other Christian virtues, has no limits.
                                 [7]
Jesus doubtless meant His answer to be interpreted, "As many
times as he sinneth against thee." Read Luke 17: 3, 4.
    4. "This talent was probably worth £200, or $1,000."—American
Revised Version. The total amount of indebtedness would thus
be ten million dollars.
    5. Note that the king granted much more than his servant
asked. The servant pleaded for time only, and promised to pay
all; but the king, in his compassion, forgave him the entire debt.
    6. "Every one who has been free to condemn or discourage,
will in his own experience be brought over the ground where he
has caused others to pass; he will feel what they have suffered
because of his want of sympathy and tenderness."—"Thoughts
from the Mount of Blessing," p. 194, new edition.
   7. The offense of those who may have done us wrong is but
a hundred pence ($17) as compared with our debt to God, a debt
of which we can not pay a farthing.
   "The great lesson of the parable lies in the contrast between
God's compassion and man's hard-heartedness ; in the fact that
God's forgiving mercy is to be the measure of our own.
`Shouldst not thou also have had compassion on thy fellow serv-
ant, even as I had pity on thee?'
   "We are not forgiven because we forgive, but as we forgive.
The ground of all forgiveness is found in the unmerited love of
God; but by our attitude toward others we show whether we have
made that love our own."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 251.
   "He who is unforgiving, cuts off the very channel through
which alone he can receive mercy from God. We should not
think that unless those whO have injured us confess the wrong,
we are justified in withholding from them our forgiveness. It is
their part, no doubt, to humble their hearts by repentance and
confession; but we are to have a spirit of compassion toward
those who have trespassed against us, whether or not they con-
fess their faults. However sorely they may have wounded us,
we are not to cherish our grievances, and sympathize with our-
selves over our injuries; but as` we hope to be pardoned for our
offenses against God, we are to pardon all who have done evil
to us."—"Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing," p. 166, new
edition.

                                QUESTIONS
 I.   On Jesus' way to the feast with His disciples, what did a
      certain man say to Him? Luke 9: 57.
2.   What reply did Jesus make to him? Verse 58. (Compare
      2 Cor. 8 : 9.) Note I.
3.   What call to service did He give to another? What excuse
      was given for refusing the invitation? Luke 9: 59•
4.   How did Jesus further urge him to follow Him? Verse 6o.
      Note 2.
5.   When the invitation was extended to another, what excuse
      did he offer? Verse 61.
6.   What unfits one for a place in the kingdom of God? Verse 62.
7.   Whom besides the twelve disciples did Jesus choose for His
      work? How were they sent forth? To what places were
      they to go? Luke 1o: 1.
8.   What did Jesus tell them concerning the harvest? For what
      were they asked to pray? Verse 2.
                                     I9]
 9. With what danger did He compare their going forth? What
    were they not to provide for their journey? How were they
    to avoid delays? Verses 3, 4. Note 3.
10. What were they to do upon entering a house? Verses 5, 6.
xi. What were they to do in a house that received them? What
    further instruction did Jesus give them? Verses 7, 8.
12. What work were they to do in the cities? What was to be
    the keynote of their message? Verse 9.
53. What did Jesus tell them to do in places where they were
    not welcome? Verses to, IL
14. What comparison did Jesus make between some of the wicked
    cities of old, and the cities which had witnessed His mighty
    works? Verses 12-15.
15. How fully did Jesus identify Himself with His disciples?
    Verse 16.
16. Concerning what did the seventy rejoice when they returned
    to Christ? Verse 57.
17. What event did this experience of the seventy bring to the
    mind of Jesus? Verse 18. Note 4.
18. What power did Christ give to His disciples? What should
    be a greater cause of joy than the possession of power?
    Verses 59, 20. Note 5.
                                 NOTES
    1. Jesus no doubt saw, that this offer to follow Him was
prompted by a desire for personal gain. By referring to His
own poverty, and His sacrifice to save man, Jesus revealed the
life of toil and privation of all who truly follow Him.
    2. This does not seem to be a request simply to attend the
funeral of a father then dead. The father might live for years.
The lesson is clearly this : Not the most urgent or important
affairs of this life must stand in the way of obeying the call of
God. He must come first; temporal things, even the most im-
portant, must take second place.
    3. He who sent forth these workers would provide and care
for them. To have carried money would have invited violence and
robbery. To have provided food in their scrip and extra cloth-
ing would have encumbered them in their labors.
    It may seem strange that Jesus instructed the seventy to "salute
no man by the way." The explanation is this: In Eastern coun-
tries, the forms of greeting passed between travelers meeting on
a journey involve so many questions, repeated expressions of
welcome, and tedious forms, 'as to cause much delay. The sev-
enty were sent forth with an important message requiring haste,
and no time was to be lost in getting from city to city.
    4. Study 2 Peter 2 : 4 ; Rev. ,I2 : 7-9; John, 12 : 31 ; Rev. 20 : 10 ;
5: 13. "The scenes of the past and the future were presented to
                                  [ 10]
the mind of Jesus. He beheld Lucifer as he was first cast out
from the heavenly places. He looked forward to the scenes of
His own agony, when before all the worlds the character of the
deceiver should be unveiled. He heard the cry, 'It is finished,'
announcing that the redemption of the lost race was forever made
certain, that heaven was made eternally secure against. the ac-
cusations, the deceptions, the pretensions, that Satan would in-
stigate.
    "Beyond the cross of Calvary, with its agony and shame,
Jesus looked forward to the great final day, when the prince of
the power of the air will meet his destruction in the earth so long
marred by his rebellion. Jesus beheld the work of evil forever
ended, and the peace of God filling heaven and earth."—"The
Desire of Ages," p. 490.
    5. "There is a book of remembrance in the heavens, the
Lamb's Book of Life, in which the names of all His true and
faithful followers are written. It may be a great thing to have
one's name inscribed in large, enduring letters in the roll of those
who have done great things for Christ and for Christ's cause upon
this earth; but that earthly register does not correspond with
the one that is kept above. There are names to be found- in the
one that will not be met with in the other. There are names which
shine bright in the one that appear but faintly luminous in the
other. There are names that have never been entered in the
one that beam forth with a heavenly brilliance in the other. The
time comes when over the one the waters of oblivion shall pass,
and its records be all wiped away. The time shall never come
when the names that shall at last be found written in the other
shall be blotted out."—"The Life of Christ," Hanna, p. 410.

                                   NOTES
  1. Self-satisfied, and occupied with their own ambitions and
pursuits, the worldly class is a difficult one to reach with the
gospel. God does not refuse spiritual things to the so-called
"wise and prudent," but they think themselves too wise to listen
to Him, and they close their ears and eyes to His Word. It is
only to the humble and to those who consider themselves babes
in understanding that the Lord can impart His light and
knowledge.
                                   1 12]
    2. " 'Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden,
and I will give you rest:
    "These words of comfort were spoken to the multitude that
followed Jesus. The Saviour had said that only through Him-
self could men receive a knowledge of God. He had spoken of
His disciples as the ones to whom a knowledge of heavenly things
had been given. But He left none to feel themselves shut out
from His care and love. All who labor and are heavy laden may
come unto Him. . . .
    "In these words, Christ is speaking to every human being.
Whether they know it or not, all are weary and heavy laden. All
are weighed down with burdens that only Christ can remove.
The heaviest burden that we bear is the burden of sin. If we
were left to bear this burden, it would crush us. But the Sinless
One has taken our place. The Lord hath laid on Him the
iniquity of us all.' He has borne the burden of our guilt. He
will take the load from our weary shoulders. He will give us
rest. The burden of care and sorrow also He will bear. He
invites us to cast all our care upon Him; for He carries us upon
His heart."—"The Desire of Ages," pp. 328, 329.
    3. "There are many whose hearts are aching under a load of
care because they seek to reach' the world's standard. They
have chosen its service, accepted its perplexities, adopted its
customs. Thus their character is marred, and their life made a
weariness. In order to gratify ambition and worldly desires, they
wound the conscience, and bring upon themselves an additional
burden of remorse. The continual worry is wearing out the life •
 forces. Our Lord desires them to lay aside this yoke of bondage.
He invites them to accept His yoke; He says, 'My yoke is easy,
and My burden is light.' He bids them seek first the kingdom of
 God and His righteousness, and His promise is, that all things
needful to them for this life shall be added. Worry is blind, and
 can not discern the future; but Jesus sees the end from the be-
ginning. In every difficulty He has His way prepared to bring
 relief. Our heavenly Father has a thousand ways to provide for
 us, of which we know nothing. Those who accept the one prin-
 ciple of making the service and honor of God supreme, will find
 perplexities vanish, and a plain path before their feet."—Id., p. 330.
     4. Contrast the two yokes. It is easy to wear the yoke of
 Jesus, because He bears the heavy end of it. When we walk in
 the way of His commandments, we are walking with Him, and in
 His love the heart finds rest. A share in His service here leads
 to a crown of rest and peace in the earth made new. Satan's
 yoke is a yoke of bondage. He would make it appear-that his
 way is the easiest, and that serving self brings happiness; yet
 there is no true happiness and joy in his service.
     5. Commenting upon the experience of the ten lepers; F. B.
 Meyer says :
                                [ 131
   "Their common misery drew these poor outcasts together and
made them forget the fierce national antipathies of Jew and
Samaritan. When bidden to go to the priest, before there were
any outward signs of healing, they started, and thus gave evidence
of their faith that they were healed. It'was this faith that saved
them, because faith like this lets in the whole tide of God's sav-
ing health. In the case of the poor alien, it was clear that he was
not only healed, but saved, as his gratitude and worship indicated.
Do we thank God, not only for His miracles, but for His daily
providence?"—"Through the Bible Day by.Day," vol. 5, p. 145.

                              LESSON 5
       HEALING THE BLIND MAN ON THE
                  SABBATH
                October 31, 1925
LESSON SCRIPTURE: John 9.
MEMORY VERSE: John 9: 4.
LESSON HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pp. 463-465, 470-415.
PLACE: Jerusalem.
PERSONS: Jesus and His disciples; a blind man; parents of the blind
  man; Pharisees and people.

                     SETTING OF THE LESSON
    Jesus in the temple at Jerusalem had drawn a sharp contrast
between the unbelief of the Jews and the faith of their father
Abraham. The priests and rabbis cried out against Him as a
blasphemer, and "then took they up stones to cast at Him: but
Jesus hid Himself, and went out of the temple, going through the
midst of them, and so passed by." Then follows the incident of
the healing of the blind man, a miracle of much importance, as
is indicated by the fact that an entire chapter is given to it.

                             NOTES
   1. "It was generally believed by the Jews that sin is punished
in this life. Every affliction was regarded as the penalty of some
                                I 15 I
  Wrongdoing, either of the sufferer himself or of his parents. It
  is true that all suffering results from the transgression of God's
  law, but this truth had become perverted. Satan, the author of
 sin and all its results, had led men to look upon disease and death
 as proceeding from God,—as punishment arbitrarily inflicted on
 account of sin. Hence one upon whom some great affliction or
 calamity had fallen, had the additional burden of being regarded
 as a great sinner."—"The Desire of Ages," pp. 470, 471.
      2. "While Jesus corrected their error, He did not explain the
  cause of the man's affliction, but told them what would be the
  result."—Id., p. 471.        •
      "Thus He transferred the question from intellectual ground
 to that of the moral purpose which suffering might serve."—
 Edersheim.
      3. The Pharisees were zealous for what they conceived to be
 the proper observance of the Sabbath, yet they were planning mur-
 der on that very day. They had abundant ground fora charge
 against Jesus, according to their man-made laws. The making
 of clay, or the application of a remedy where life or an organ
 was not in danger, was considered as Sabbath breaking. "It was
 not lawful to wash the eyes with spittle medicinally on the Sabbath
 day, much less to go to a pool of water to wash them."—"Com-
 mentary," Henry and Scott, p. 421.
      4. Edersheim states that among the Jews there were three
 kinds of "excommunication." The first and lightest was a rebuke.
 Ordinarily the period of disapproval lasted for seven days, but if
 pronounced by the head of the Sanhedrin, it continued for thirty
 days. The second degree of excommunication lasted for thirty
 days ; and at the end of that term, "a second admonition" was
given, which extended the time thirty days longer. This could be
pronounced only in an assembly of ten, and was accompanied by
curses, and sometimes proclaimed with a blast of the horn. The
 final excommunication placed a ban of indefinite duration on a
man. "Henceforth he was like one dead. He was not allowed to
study with others, no intercourse was to be held with him, he was
not even to be shown the road. He might, indeed, buy the
necessaries of life, but it was forbidden to eat or drink with such
an one."
     5. "The man was made of sturdier stuff than his parents. He
was not to be overawed by their authority, or knocked down by
their assertions. . . . 'We know,' the Pharisees had said, 'that
this man is a sinner.' 'Whether He is a sinner,' the man replied,
`I do not know ; one thing I do know, that, being blind, now I see.'
Then they began again their weary and futile. cross-examination.
`What did He do to thee? How did He open thine eyes?' But
the man had had enough of this. 'I told yOu once, and ye did
not attend. Why do ye wish to hear again? Is it possible that ye
too wish to be His disciples?' Bold irony .this—to ask these
stately, ruffled, scrupulous Sanhedrists, whether he was really to
                              [ 161
regard them as anxious and sincere inquirers about the claims
of the Nazarene Prophet! Clearly here was a man whose pre-
sumptuous honesty would neither be bullied into suppression
nor corrupted into a lie. He was quite impracticable. So, since
authority, threats, blandishments had all failed, they broke into
abuse. . . . Unable to control any longer , their transport of in-
dignation, they flung him out of the hall, and out of the
synagogue."—"Life of Christ," Farrar, p. 398.
    6. "If sifting the evidence for a miracle, stating every possible
objection to it, discussing publicly, not centuries afterwards, but
at the time and on the spot, the whole details, turning the occur-
rence out and in, back and forth, exhausting every effort to shake
its validity, and then finding that it 'has been a veritable work
above the ordinary processes of nature and beyond the powers of
men—if such cross-examination should seem to anyone essential to
his believing in the historicity of the miracles, in this instance it
actually took place, and we have the circumstantial record of it in
this chapter.
    "This treatment is entirely exceptional in the miracle narra-
tives; but on that account this single specimen has all the greater
apologetic value. It can no more be said that the difficulties of
the modern mind are wholly disregarded in the Gospels. Here is
precisely that argumentative handling of the various difficulties
about a miracle with which we are so familiar. The occurrence
is related. Then arise the questions upon it: Was there really
anything unusual done? How was it done? Who was the doer
of it? Was the doing of it a mark of divine commission and
authority? Who and what shall we conclude the worker of it to
be? These and such as these are the questions which every age—'
our own preeminently—has asked about the miracles of Jesus.
They are asked and answered, in this instance, in presence of the
facts themselves."—"Miracles of Our Lord," Laidlaw.

                  SETTING OF THE LESSON
   The parable of the good shepherd is apparently a continuation
of the conversation which arose out of the healing of the blind
man as recorded in the previous chapter. One writer says, "Per-
                              I17 ]
 haps the parable was suggested by the sight of the shepherds and
 their flocks on the hills about Jerusalem."

   r.•"The Pharisees had not entered by the door. They had
climbed into the fold by another way than Christ, and they were
not fulfilling the work of the true shepherd. The priests and
rulers, the scribes and Pharisees, destroyed the living pastures,
and defiled the wellsprings of the water of life."—"The Desire of
Ages," P. 478.
     Not only is Jesus a door or entrance to life and safety, but the
 only one. All those who at any time teach any other way than
 the merits of Christ for salvation, whether they be Jewish leaders,
 heathen philosophers, or professed Christian teachers, are thieves
 and robbers; "for there is none other name under heaven given
 among men, whereby we must be saved."
     2. "I am the good shepherd; and I know Mine own, and/Mine
 own know Me." John Io: 14, A. R. V. What a precious lesson is
 taught by this parable, setting forth so clearly the mission of
 Christ, and the intimate relation existing between Him and His
-people. To get the force of the illustration, we should understand
 shepherd life in the East. Note the following description of an
 Oriental scene:
     "As we sat and looked, almost spellbound, the silent hillsides
 around us were in a moment filled with life and sound. The
 shepherds led their flocks forth from the gates of the city. They
 were in full view, and we watched them and listened to them
 with no little interest. Thousands of sheep and goats were there,
 grouped in dense, confused masses. The shepherds stood to:
 gether until all came out. Then they separated, each shepherd
  taking a different path, and uttering, as he advanced, a shrill,
 peculiar call. The sheep heard them. At first the masses swayed
 and moved, as if shaken by some internal convulsion; then points
  struck out in the direction taken by the shepherds; these became
  longer and longer, until the confused masses were resolved into
  long, living streams, flowing after their leaders. Such a sight was
  not new to me, still it had lost none of its interest. It was, per-
  haps, one of the most vivid illustrations which human eyes could
  witness of that beautiful discourse of our Lord recorded by John."
 —Porter, in "Bible Student's Manual."
    3. "Jesus thought upon the souls all over the earth who were
 misled by false shepherds. Those whom He longed to gather as
 the sheep of His pasture were scattered among wolves, and He
 said, 'Other sheep I have, which are not of this fold.' "—"The
 Desire of Ages," p. 483.
                                [19]
    4. ",`Therefore doth My Father love Me, because I lay down
My life, that I might take it again.' That is, My Father has so
loved you, that He even loves Me more for giving My life to
redeem you. In becoming your substitute and surety, by surren-
dering My life, by taking your liabilities, your transgressions, I
am endeared to My Father. . . . While as a member of the
human family He was mortal, as God He was the fountain of
life for the world. He could have withstood the advances of
death, and refused to come under its dominion ; but voluntarily
He laid down His life, that He might bring life and immortality
to light. He bore the sin of the world, endured its curse, yielded
up His life as a sacrifice, that men might not eternally die."—Id.,
pp. 483, 484.
    5. It is repeatedly stated that the Father raised Jesus from the
dead. (See Acts 2:24; 3 : 15; 4: 10 ; 5:3o; to: 4o; 13 : 30-37;
  Thess. I : to; Rom. 4 : 24, 25; 6 : 4; 8: I.) On the other hand,
Jesus speaks of it as His own act. John 2: 19; JO: 17, 18. There
is no contradiction in these texts. Both statements are true, and
the unity of both is clearly seen by reading John 5: 19-30.
    For a description of the resurrection, see "The Desire of
Ages," pp. 779, 780.
    6. "Though now He has ascended to the presence of God, and
shares the throne of the universe, Jesus has lost none of His
compassionate nature. To-day the same tender, sympathizing
heart is open to all the woes of humanity. To-day the hand that
was pierced is reached forth to bless more abundantly His people
that are in the world. 'And they shall never perish ; neither shall
any man pluck them out of My hand.' The soul that has given
himself to Christ is more precious in His sight than the whole
world. The Saviour would have passed through the agony of
Calvary, that one might be saved in His kingdom. He will never
abandon one for whom He has died. Unless His followers choose
to leave Him, He will hold them fast.
    "Through all our trials we have a never-failing Helper. He
does not leave us alone to struggle with temptation, to battle with
evil, and be finally crushed with burdens and sorrow. Though
now He is hidden from mortal sight, the ear of faith can hear
His voice saying, Fear not; I am with you. 'I am He that liveth,
and was dead; and, behold, I am alive forevermore.' I have en-
dured your sorrows, experienced your struggles, encountered your
temptations. I know your tears; I also have wept. The griefs
that lie too deep to be breathed into any human ear, I know.
Think not that you are desolate and forsaken. Though your pain
touch no responsive chord in any heart on earth, look unto Me,
and live."—"The Desire of Ages," pp. 480, 483.

of their children, that they may have a more thorough knowledge
of the Scriptures."—"Testimonies," vol. 3, p. 189.

                            LESSON 7
    PARABLE OF THE GOOD SAMARITAN
                       November 14, 1925
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Luke 10: 25-37.
MEMORY VERSE: Luke 10: 27.
LESSON HELPS: "The Desire of Ages," pp. 497-505; "Christ's Object'
  Lessons," pp.• 376-389.
PLACE: Not certainly known.
PERSONS: Jesus and His disciples; a lawyer; the multitude.

                    SETTING OF THE LESSON
  - The topic, "Who is my neighbor?" was an old one. "Among
the Jews this question caused endless dispute. They had no doubt
as to the heathen and the Samaritans; these were strangers and
enemies. But where should the distinction be made among the
people of their own nation, and among the different classes of
society? Whom should the priest, the rabbi, the elder, regard as
neighbor? They spent their lives' in a round of ceremonies to
make themselves pure. Contact with the ignorant and careless
multitude, they taught, would cause defilement that would require
wearisome effort to remove. Were they to regard the 'unclean' as
neighbors?"—"The Desire of Ages," p. 498.
    The story told by Jesus "was no imaginary scene, but an actual
occurrence, which was known to be exactly as represented. The
priest and the Levite who had passed by on the other side were
in the company that listened to Christ's words."—Id., P. 499.

    Samaritan? Note 6.
13. What lesson is needed to-day? Note 7.
                              NOTES
    T. The men called "lawyers" were those who "devoted them-
selves to the study and •explanation of the Jewish law, particu-
larly of the traditionary or oral law." This lawyer "was not
satisfied with the position and works of the Pharisees. He had
been studying the Scriptures with a desire to learn their real
meaning. He had a vital interest in the matter, and had asked
in sincerity, 'What shall I do?' "—"The Desire of Ages," p. 497.
    2. "The Pharisees had suggested this question to the lawyer,
in the hope that they might entrap Christ in His words, and they
listened eagerly for His answer. But the Saviour entered into
no controversy. He required the answer from the questioner
himself. . . . The Saviour's commendation of 'this answer placed
Him on vantage ground with the rabbis. They could not condemn
Him for sanctioning that which had been advanced by an ex-
positor of the law."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 377.
    3. A priest "passed by." Those who belonged to the priest-
hood were regarded as the most holy among the Jews. Many
priests lived at Jericho. Peloubet suggests of this one: "Possibly
he thought that the robbers were still in the neighborhood and he
would be in danger from them. He had excuses enough, we may
be sure,—such as they were."
    4. "The care of the temple, the oversight of the poor, the doing
of works of charity and mercy," were the specially named duties
                              [ 22
of the Levites. Like the priest, the Levite no doubt had excuses
which he thought sufficient to relieve him from any responsibility
in the matter.
    5. "Two pence," two denarii, about thirty-three cents, two days'
wages, or enough for several days' care.
    6. "In the story of the good Samaritan; Jesus gave a picture of
Himself and His Mission. Man had been deceived, bruised,
robbed, and ruined by Satan, and left ,to perish; but the Saviour
had compassion on our helpless condition. He left His glory, to
come to our rescue. He found us ready to die, and He undertook
our case. He healed our wounds. He covered us with His robe
of righteousness. 'He opened to us a refuge of safety, and made
complete provision for us at His own charges. He died to re-
deem us. Pointing to His own example, He says to His followers,
`These things I command you, that ye love one another:' 'As I
have loved you, that ye also love one another.' "—"The Desire of
Ages," pp. 503, 504.
    7. "The lesson is no less needed in the world to-day than when
it fell from the lips of Jesus. Selfishness and cold formality have
well-nigh extinguished the fire of love, and dispelled the graces
that should make fragrant the character. Many who profess His
name have lost sight of the fact that Christians are to represent
Christ. Unless there is practical self-sacrifice for the good of
others, in the family circle, in the neighborhood, in the church,
and wherever' we may be, then whatever our profession, we are
not Christians."—Id., p. 504.

                 SETTING OF THE LESSON.
    In this world which He came to save, Jesus. had no home of
  His own. He was dependent upon the hospitality of His friends.
  "Our' Saviour appreciated a quiet home and interested listeners.
  He longed for human tenderness, courtesy, and affection.:"--"The
, Desire of Ages," h. 524.
                                 [ 23 1
   The "certain village" was Bethany, the home of Mary and
Martha and Lazarus. This little town was on the east slope of
Mount Olivet, about two miles southeast of Jerusalem, on the
road to Jericho.
                   Suggestions for Daily Family Study

15. What effect did the teaching of these expounders of the law
    really have? Verse 52.
16. What did the words of Jesus lead the scribes and Pharisees
    to do? Verses 53, 54.
                               NOTES
     T. Wrong conclusions should not be drawn from the words of
 Jesus to Martha. Hospitality is highly commended in the Bible,
 and Martha was giving the highest proof of liberality and benevo-
 lence in thus entertaining the Lord. But in trying to exercise her
 office as a true hostess, she did what many are doing,—she was
 "careful and troubled about many things,"—unnecessary care and
 trouble! How much of this is seen in home life to-day! Where
 a few simple things suffice for the present need, many things are
 added, and in consequence, the heart is filled with care, the spirit
 chafes, and the mind is thrown into tumult. This was Martha's
 trouble, and the basis of her appeal to Jesus for help. He would
 have been well pleased had she spent less time in serving, and
 given more time for the "better part" for which the Lord com-
 mended Mary.
     2. This does not refer to the washing of hands to cleanse
 them, but to the ceremonial washing which was a religious 'form.
 Jesus "exposed the mere externalism of the Pharisaic law of
 purification, to the utter ignoring of the higher need of inward
 purity, which lay at the foundation of all."—"Life and Times of
 Jesus the Messiah," Edersheim, p. 211>
     3. Referring to Luke II :42, we have this comment: "In these
 words Christ again condemns the abuse of sacred obligation. The
 obligation itself He does not set aside. The tithing system was
 ordained by God, and it had been observed from the earliest
 times. Abraham, the father of the faithful, paid tithes of all that
 he possessed. The Jewish rulers recognized the obligation of
 tithing, and this was right ; but they did not leave the people to
  carry out their own convictions of duty."—"The Desire of Ages,"
  pp. 616, 617.
     4. "The three distinctions of a Pharisee were: not to make
  use nor to partake of anything that had not been tithed; to ob-
  serve the laws of purification; and, as a consequence of these
  two, to abstain from familiar intercourse with all non-Pharisees.
  This separation formal the ground of their claim to distinction.
  It will be noticed that it is exactly to these three things our Lord
. adverts; so that these sayings of His are not, as might seem, un-
  connected, but in the strictest internal relationship. Our Lord
  shows how Pharisaism, as regarded the outer, was connected with
  the opposite tendency, as regarded the inner man: outward puri-
  fication, with ignorance of the need of that inward purity which
  consisted in God-consecration, and with the neglect of it;,strict-
  ness of outward tithing, with ignorance and neglect of the
                                [25 7
principle which underlay it, viz., the acknowledgment of God's
right over mind and heart (judgment and love of God) ; while,
lastly, the Pharisaic pretense of separation, and consequent' claim
to distinction, issued only in pride and self-assertion. Thus,, tried
by its own tests, Pharisaism terribly failed."—"Life and Times of
Jesus the Messiah," Edersheim, p. 212.
    5. By building these tombs, they pretended to honor the
martyred prophets, thus gaining popularity; but their actions
showed them to possess the same spirit as that which led their
fathers to kill the prophets.

57. What application did Jesus make of the parable? Verse 21,
                               NOTES
    I. Hypocrisy is one of the worst forms of evil. All shams are
hateful, but a religious sham is worst of all. Admitted into the
life, it will corrupt the whole nature, just as it had corrupted the
Pharisees.
    "The religion of Christ is sincerity itself. Zeal for God's
glory is the motive implanted by the Holy Spirit; and only the
effectual working of the Spirit can implant this motive. Only the
power of God can banish self-seeking and hypocrisy. This change
is the sign of His working. When the faith we accept destroys
selfishness and pretense, when it leads us to seek God's glory and.
not our own, we may know that it is of the right order."-"The
Desire of Ages," p. 409.
    2. "He who would confess Christ, must have Christ abiding
 in him. He can not communicate that which he has not received.
 The disciples might speak fluently on doctrines, they might repeat
 the words of Christ Himself; but unless they possessed Christ-
 like meekness and love, they were not confessing Him. A spirit
 contrary to the spirit of Christ would deny Him, whatever the
 profession. Men may deny Christ by evil-speaking, by foolish
 talking, by words that are untruthful or unkind. They may deny
 Him by shunning life's burdens, by the pursuit of sinful pleasure.
                               E27 7
They may deny Him by conforming to the world, by uncourteous
behavior, by the love of their own opinions, by justifying self, by
cherishing doubt, borrowing trouble, and dwelling in darkness.
In all these ways they declare that Christ is not in them. And
`whosoever shall deny Me before men,' He says, 'him will I also
deny before My Father which is in heaven.'"—Id., p. 357.
   3. It is possible to drive the Spirit from us so that its pleading
voice can not be heard. "To-day if ye will hear His voice, harden
not your hearts," for "the sin against the Holy Ghost is the sin of
persistent refusal to respond to the invitation to repent."—Mrs.
E. G. White, in "Review and Herald," June 29, 1897.
   4. "The Saviour's mission on earth was fast drawing to a
close. Only a few months remained for Him to complete what
He had come to do, in establishing the kingdom of His grace.
Yet human greed would have turned Him from His work, to
take up the dispute over a piece of land. But Jesus was not to be
diverted from His mission. His answer was, 'Man, who made
Me a judge or a divider over you?'
   "Jesus could have told this man just what was right. He knew
the right in the case ; but the brothers were in a quarrel because
both were covetous. Christ virtually said, It is not My work to
settle controversies of this kind. He came for another purpose,
to preach the gospel, and thus to arouse men to a sense of eternal
realities.
   "In Christ's treatment of this case is a lesson for all who
minister in His, name. When He sent forth the twelve, He said,
`As ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.
Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils :
freely ye have received, freely give.' They were not to settle the
temporal affairs of the people. Their work was to persuade men
to be reconciled to God. In this work lay their power to bless
humanity. The only remedy for the sins and sorrows of men is
Christ. The gospel of His grace alone can cure the evils that
curse society. The injustice of the rich toward the poor, the
hatred of the poor toward the rich, alike have their root in self-
ishness, and this can be eradicated only through submission to
Christ. He alone, for the selfish heart of sin, gives the new heart
of love. Let the servants of Christ preach the gospel with the
Spirit sent down from heaven, and work as He did for the benefit
of men. Then such results will be manifest, in the blessing and
uplifting of mankind, as are wholly impossible of accomplishment
by human power."—"Christ's Object Lessons," pp. 253, 254-
   5. "The rich man was in perplexity as to what he should do
with his produce. His barns were full to overflowing, and he
had no place to put the surplus of his harvest. He did not think
of God, from whom all his mercies had come. He did not realize
that God had made him a steward of His goods, that he might
help the needy. He had a blessed opportunity of being God's
almoner, but he thought only of ministering to his own comfort.
                               L231
   "The situation of the poor, the orphan, the widow, the suffer-
ing, the afflicted, was brought to this rich man's attention; there
were many places in which to bestow his goods. He could easily
have relieved himself of a portion of his abundance, and many
homes would have been freed from want, many who were hungry
would have been fed, many naked clothed, many hearts made glad,
many prayers for bread and clothing answered, and a melody of
praise would have ascended to heaven. The Lord had heard the
prayers of the needy, and of His goodness He had prepared for
the poor. Abundant provision for the wants of many had been
made in the blessings bestowed upon the rich man. But he closed
his heart to the cry of the needy."—Id., p. 256.
   6. How prone man is to trust in uncertain riches (t Tim. 6:
17), and selfishly to hoard God's gifts which were meant to be
used to bless humanity and for the glory of God. But "to live
for self is to perish. Covetousness, the desire of benefit for self's
sake, cuts the soul. off from life. It is the spirit of Satan to get.
to draw to self. It is the spirit of Christ to give, to sacrifice self
for the good of others."—Id., p. 259.
 , It is not a sin to have worldly possessions. The Lord expects
us to be diligent and economical in our business affairs (Rom.
12: t t ; Prov. to: 4; 27: 23), that we may have resources with
which to help the needy and support the gospel. Eph. 4: 28. The
use we make of our means in this selfish, grasping age, is a good
index to our Christian experience.

                                   NOTES
    1. "Because we know not the exact time of His coming, we
 are commanded to watch. 'Blessed are those servants, whom the
 Lord when He cometh shall find watching.' Those who watch
 for the Lord's coming are not waiting in idle expectancy. The
 expectation of Christ's coming is to make men fear the Lord,
 and fear His -judgments upon transgression. It is to awaken
 them to the great sin of rejecting His offers of mercy. Those'
 who are watching for the Lord, are purifying their souls by
                                   1 30 1
obedience to the truth. With vigilant watching they combine
earnest working."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 634.
   2. "If such [those who have neglected preparation] had only
known that the work of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary would
close so soon, how differently would they have conducted them-
selves ! how earnestly would they have watched! The Master
anticipating all this, gives them timely warning in the command
to watch. He distinctly states the suddenness of His coming. He
does not measure the time, lest we shall neglect a momentary
preparation, and in our indolence lopk ahead to the time when we
think He will come, and defer the preparation. 'Watch ye there-
fore ;.for ye know not.' "—"Testimonies," vol. a, p. 191.
   3::As many prophets and kings had desired to witness the
events connected with Jesus' first coming (Luke 1o:24), so the
prophets have spoken of, and looked forward to, the consumma-
tion of the Christian's hope (Acts 3 : 21) at His second coming. ,
We are living in the last generation, with the light of all genera-
tions focused upon our pathway. To us much has been given, and
of us- much will be required.
    "The Lord measures with exactness every possibility for serv-
ice. The unused capabilities are as much brought into account as
are those that are improved. For all that we might become
through the right use of our talents God holds us responsible..
We shall be judged according to what we ought to have done,
but did not accomplish because we did not use our powers to
glorify God."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 363.
    4. The gospel is a gospel of peace (Eph. 6: 15), peace in the
individual heart, and peace in society as far as its principles are
received. But sin and 'righteousness are in deadly conflict, and
those who accept the gospel are often opposed by those who do'
not, just as Cain was opposed to Abel "because his own works
were evil, and his brother's righteous." I John 3: 12.
    5. "The world, full of rioting, full of godless pleasure, is
asleep, asleep in carnal security. Men are putting afar off the
coming of the Lord. They laugh at warnings. . . . Everything
in the world is in agitation. The signs of the times are ominous.
Coming events cast their shadows before. The Spirit of God is
withdrawing from the earth, and calamity follows calamity by
sea and by land. There are tempests, earthquakes, fires, floods,
murders of every grade. Who can read the future? Where is
security? There is assurance in nothing that is human or earthly.
Rapidly are men ranging themselves under the banner they have
chosen. Restlessly are they waiting and watching the movements
of their leaders. There are those who are waiting and watching
and working for our Lord's appearing. Another class are falling
into line under the generalship of the first, great apostate. Few
believe with heart and soul that we have a hell to shun and a
heaven to win."—"The Desire of Ages," pp. 635, 636.

THE BARREN FIG TREE; WOMAN HEALED
         ON THE SABBATH
                         December 12, 1925
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Luke 13: 1:17.

PLACE: Somewhere in Perea, beyond Jordan.
PERSONS: Jesus and His disciples; Jewish rulers and people; the infirm
  woman.
                 SETTING OF THE LESSON
    "Christ had been warning the people of the coming of the
kingdom of God, and He had sharply rebuked their ignorance and
indifference. . . . The hearers told Jesus of an event which had
just caused great excitement. Some of the measures of Pontius
Pilate, the governor of Judea, had given offense to the people.
There had been a popular tumult in Jerusalem, and Pilate had
attempted to quell this by violence. On one occasion his soldiers
has even invaded the precincts of the temple, and had cut down
some Galilean pilgrims in the very act of slaying their sacrifices.
The Jews regarded calamity as a judgment on account of the
sufferer's sin, and those who told of this act of violence did so
with secret satisfaction. In their view their own good fortune
proved them to be much better, and therefore more favored by
God, than were these Galileans. They expected to hear from
Jesus words of condemnation for these men, who, they doubted
not, richly deserved their punishment."—"Christ's Object Lessons,"

  16. Recall former experiences of healing on the Sabbath. Note 5.

                               NOTES
     1. Recall the question of the disciples concerning the blind
 man by the wayside : "Master, who did sin, this man, or his
 parents, that he was born blind?" John 9: 2. Now again Jesus
 tried to impress upon them that physical injuries or great mis-
 fortunes were not always the direct results of personal sins.
     2. "As Jesus talked with the disciples and the multitude, He
 looked forward with prophetic glance, and saw Jerusalem be-
 sieged with armies. He heard the tramp of the aliens marching
 against the chosen city, and saw the thousands upon thousands
 perishing in the siege. Many of the Jews were, like those Gali-
 leans, slain in the temple courts, in the very act of offering
 sacrifice. The calamities that had fallen upon individuals were
 warnings from God to a nation equally guilty. 'Except ye repent,'
 said Jesus, 'ye shall all 'likewise perish.' For a little time the
 day of probation lingered for them. There was still time for
  them to know the things that belonged to their peace."—"Chrises-
  Object Lessons," pp. 213, 214.
     3. We may learn from the parable of the barren fig tree that
  those who bear no fruit will be cut off. (Compare John 15: 1-6.)
                               [33 7
But we may also learn the long-suffering of Christ, and be en-
couraged. We know that one who had taken great-pains with
a tree, cultivating and dressing it carefully, without seeing any
fruit for three years, would not cut it'down the fourth year, if-it
bore only a little fruit. "Every branch that beareth fruit; He
purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit." "He who began
a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Jesus Christ."
Phil. 1 : 6, A. R. V.
    4. "Christ's hearers could not misunderstand the application of
His words. David had sung of Israel as the vine brought out of
Egypt. Isaiah had written, 'The vineyard of the Lord of hosts
is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah His pleasant plant.'
The generation to whom the Saviour had come were represented
by the fig tree in the Lord's vineyard,—within the circle of His
special care and blessing."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 214.
    5. There are several interesting accounts -of healing which
Jesus performed on the Sabbath. In Jerusalem, the impotent
man (John 5) and the blind man (John 9) were healed; and in
both instances, a spirited controversy, with the Jews followed.
In Galilee, the man with the unclean spirit and Peter's wife's
mother were healed on the Sabbath (Mark 1:21-32). In Perea,
beyond Jordan, the healing of the afflicted woman on the Sabbath
(Luke 13:11-17) aroused the ruler of the synagogue to express
his indignation.

                                   NOTES
   1. "In the road to death the- whole race may go, with all
their worldliness, all their selfishness, -all their pride, dishonesty,
and moral debasement. There is room for every man's opinions
and doctrines, space to follow his- inclinations, to do whatever his
self-love may dictate. In order to go in the path that leads to
destruction, there is no need of searching for the way; for the
                                    [ 35 3
gate is wide, and the way is broad, and the feet naturally turn
into the path that ends in death.
    "But the way to life is narrow and the entrance strait. If you
cling to any besetting sin, you will find the way too narrow for
you to enter. Your own ways, your own will, your evil habits
and practices, must be given up if you would keep the way of the
Lord. He who would serve Christ can not follow the world's
opinions, or meet the world's standard."—"Thoughts from the
Mount of Blessing," pp. 197, 598.
    2. "The test of sincerity is not in words, but in deeds."—
"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 272.
    "Saddest of all words that ever fell on mortal ear are those
words of doom, 'I know you not.' "—Id., p. 413.
   'The class of persons described *in Luke 13: 25-27 are those
who profess to love God, and show great activity -in good works,
as many of the Jews did, yet do not repent of their sins and obey
the word of the Lord.
    3. "Jesuskhad now been for some time in Perea, in the terri-
tory of Antipas, the murderer of John. The intense unpopularity
of the crime had, doubtless, been a protection to Him; but, be-
sides the fact that Antipas personally feared the great Miracle-
worker, thinking He was perhaps the murdered Baptist, risen
from the dead, there were many other reasons why he should
wish Him fairly out of his dominions. Unwilling to appear in
the matter, he used the Pharisees, counting on their readiness to
further his end. Some of their number, therefore, came to Christ,
with the air of friends anxious for His safety, and warned Him
that it would be well for Him to leave Perea as quickly as pos-
sible, as Herod desired to kill Him.
    "Jesus at once saw through the whole design, as a crafty plan
of Herod for His expulsion. But He was on His way to Jerusa-
lem, and contented Himself with showing that He gave no ground
for political suspicion, and that He quite well understood how
little friendship there was in the advice the Pharisees had given
Him."—"Life and Words of Christ," Geikie, vol. 2, p. 343.
    4. "Your house." Jesus does not now speak of it as "My
house." It was once the Lord's temple, God's own house. He
dwelt over the mercy seat between the cherubims; His glory, the
holy Shekinah, lighted all its rooms. There He spoke to His
priests in guiding and giving the nation counsel. To it the nation
looked when they remembered the God of all the earth.
     But now Jesus says "your temple," your house, to intimate that
God had abandoned it and would dwell in it no more forever.
So in 2 Chron. 36: 17, when He delivered the temple into the
hands of the Chaldean's,—the house of your sanctuary. A similar
form of speech is found in Ex. 32: 7, where the Lord said to
Moses, "thy people," to intimate that He acknowledged them no
longer for His followers.      *

      About "OUR LITTLE FRIEND
           What your Sabbath School Quarterly is to
      you, the Sabbath school section of Our Little
      Friend is to your boy or girl, and to all the
      other boys and girls in the Sabbath school who
      have it. Thousands of children have formed
      the daily study habit. Even many tiny tots are
      listening eagerly every day, or every night be-
       fore good-night is said, to the reading of the
      lesson story. A beautiful plan, isn't it?
           By encouraging the circulation of Our
      Little Friend, you are increasing its opportu-
      nities for bringing blessings to still other boys
      and girls. Will you nor help to get it into the
      hands of the neighbors' children? Nothing so
      influences children's lives as the literature that
      is their own, that they learn to love in childhood.
           Our Little Friend is endeavoring to give the
      very best in a variety of stories, articles, lessons,
      pictures, and poems, that build for the best in
      morals, manners, play, work, health, speech,
      and Christian living.

"This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached
in all the world for a witness unto all nations."
    We believe that statement. That is why
our entire Sabbath school donations and Thir-
teenth Sabbath Offerings are given to foreign
missions.
    A better knowledge of these mission fields
and the conditions under which they are oper-
ated can be had from the book

    OUR STORY OF MISSIONS
                By WILLIAM A. SPICER
             President of our General Conferenqe
    A story of mission work throughout the ages and
the development of modern missions, which will awaken
ambition, deepen conviction, increase confidence, and
roll a burden for souls upon those who read it. For
young and old.
    Preliminary to the introduction of our own world-
wide work, the author takes the reader back to ancient
Israel, and makes clear God's plan of revealing Himself
to others through His people. Coming down to New
Testament times and through the centuries that follow,
we find this plan continued through the faithful wit-
nessing of Jesus' disciples, the apostles, the early church
members, and Protestants in the great Reformation
movement.
    Then follow chapters entitled, "Preparation for the
Era of Missions ;" 'Beginning of the Era of Modern
 Missions ;" "Preparation of the Way for the Advent
 Movement and Message;" and "Beginning of Seventh-
 Day Adventist Missions."
     It is tragic at times—for many have paid the price
 with their lives, and their graves continue as witnesses ;
 soul-inspiring—for God's interposing providences have
 been seen again and again in every part of the great
 field. Recent experiences' and marvelous escapes of our
 workers in Russia, Germany, Austria, Turkey, and other
 of the more difficult countries, are thrillingly told.
    Thirteen especially prepared maps add greatly to the
 interest. Bound in cloth, 372 pages, postpaid, $1.75.
