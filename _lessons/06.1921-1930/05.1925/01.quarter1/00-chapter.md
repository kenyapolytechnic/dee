    ENROLL IN THE SABBATH SCHOOL
  You are not a member of the Sabbath school unless your
name is enrolled. There are persons who attend frequently,
but who, because their names are not recorded, can not be
counted, and so are among the "missing members."


                                 Printed in U. S. A.
  SUGGESTIVE OUTLINE
            for FAMILY STUDY of the
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSONS
N   OTE: Reference is made, in the following outline, to the lessons
     for the youth and children. Disregard these in cases where The
Youth's Instructor or Our Little Friend is not used in the home. The
design is to include in the daily study plan the lessons used by each
member of the family. As the suggested plan of study is general, make
such change%, eliminations, or additions each week as may •be necessary
to fit the outline to the particular lesson to be studied. Remember
always that the study outline can be varied to suit circumstances; but
we do urge upon all, the necessity of daily, systematic study of the
scriptures covered by the Sabbath school lessons.
Sabbath: Read the Lesson Scripture in the Bible, and the
lesson story as told in Our Little Friend. Note the setting of
the lesson as given in the junior lesson in The Youth's In-
structor. Begin drilling the children on the memory verse,
continuing this each day.
Sunday: Let the lesson story be told, each member of the
family contributing a part. Read again the difficult parts of
the lesson, and note omitted details in the story-telling.
Monday: Study the senior notes, and some of the notes in
The Youth's Instructor lessons. Study the ancient manners
and customs to which reference may be made.
Tuesday: Name the persons mentioned in the lesson, telling
what each one said or did. Study the remainder of the lesson
notes. Read selected portions of the LesSon Help.
Wednesday: Study the geography of the lesson, using a map.
Define any difficult words. Compare Gospels and parallel
scriptures. Ask questions from the junior or primary lesson.
Study special points suggested by the lesson but not included
in this outline.
Thursday: Review the lesson by using the youth's lesson in
The Youth's Instructor, and study the notes. Discuss the
special questions introduced in the junior lessons. These are
under various headings, such as, "Topics for Discussion,"
"Find Out," etc. Read selected portions of the Lesson Help.
Friday: Review the principal points in the lesson narrative.
Ask the children the questions in their lesson. Repeat the
most important texts connected with the lesson. Emphasi.ze
the practical points in the lesson, adapting these to the ages
of the youth and children in the home. •

                    SETTING OF THE LESSON
   About four hundred years passed. between the close of Old
Testament history as recorded in .the Bible and the events of the
New Testament. Ezra and. Nehemiah had rebuilt Jerusalem and
the temple, and the temple service had been restored. Synagogues
as places of worship were built in towns and villages, although,
as of old, sacrifices were offered only in the temple at Jerusalem.
All through these years, the Jews remembered the promise that
God would send His Son as their Saviour. But m.any.confused the
prophecies of His first coming and the work He would then do,•
with those of His second coming in power and glory, to redeem
His people. As a nation, they were expecting a king and ruler
who would again make of them a mighty people. 'Few of the Jews
understood that special heart preparation was needed to receive
the Messiah for whom they were looking.

                              NOTES
    r. Through prophecy, type, and symbol in the Scriptures,
Israel for generations had been taught to look for the Messiah.
At the time of Christ's first advent, the world socially and reli-
giously was in a state of degeneracy bordering on dissolution. A
deliverer greater than the world had produced up to that time
was looked for earnestly. The minds of the people were in a
state of expectancy. Many impostors were putting themselves
forward as leaders and saviors of the people and gathering dis-
ciples to themselves.
   At this juncture, John the Baptist appeared, clothed in strange
garments, living the life of a Nazarite, preaching with fearless
earnestness and zeal under unusual surroundings, and claiming
for his credentials the teachings of two venerated prophets. He
proclaimed the doctrine of repentance and remission of sins. His
was a preparatory message—the work of a forerunner—to turn
the attention of all to the coming of the Messiah.
                                 [5]
    2. Zacharias and his wife, Elisabeth, were both of the priestly
 family. (See i Chron. 24: to; Luke I : 5. Abijah is called Abia
in the latter text.) Elisabeth and Mary were of blood relation-
ship. The family to which Elisabeth belonged is reckoned in the
chronology of Christ as given in Matt. I: 7; and Luke 1:36
 (A. R. V.) calls Elisabeth Mary's "kinswoman," usually under-
stood to be a cousin, whether by marriage or by birth.
    In I Chron. 24: 7-19, we read of the division of the sons of
Aaron into twenty-four courses. As, there were thousands of the
descendants of Aaron who were entitled to render priestly serv-
ice, this division was necessary so that all the priests might be
represented in the service of the sanctuary during the year. When
a course came up to relieve those who had served the preceding
week, the particular service of each priest was determined by
lot. Certain services were accounted more honorable than others;
and by the casting of lots, all contention was avoided. The most
honorable of all was that of going into the holy place to offer
incense upon the golden altar. And on this occasion, this distin-
guished office devolved upon the aged Zacharias.
    3. "While he [Zacharias] prays, there stands a mysterious
presence before him, on the right side of the altar, the side of
good omen, as the angels, afterwards, appeared at the right side,
in the holy sepulcher, and as Christ was seen, by the martyr
Stephen, standing on the right hand of God. No wonder he was
alarmed at such a sight, in such a place. Fear of the supernatural
is instinctive. In the history of his own nation, which Zacharias,
like every Jew, knew so well, Jacob had held it a wonder that he
had, as he believed, seen God face to face, and that his life was
preserved; Jehovah Himself had hidden Moses in a cleft of the
rock, that he might see the divine glory only after it had passed
by, 'For no man,' He had said, 'shall see Me and live-' The stout-
hearted Gideon had trembled at the sight of an angel; Manoah
had expected to die after a similar vision; and when Daniel saw
the very angel now before Zacharias, 'there remained no strength
in him.' "—"The Life and Words of Christ," Geikie, vol. I, p. 94.
   4. "I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God." After
appearing to Zacharias, Gabriel was later sent to announce the
birth of Christ. (Luke : 26, 27.) Doubtless he is the one who
was sent to Daniel to communicate the information found in Dan.
JO : I I. (Compare Dan. 9: 21.),
    5. "The life of John was not spent in idleness, in ascetic gloom,
or in selfish isolation. From time to time he went forth to mingle
with men; and he was ever an interested observer of what was
passing in the world. . . . The burden of his mission was upon
him. In solitude, by meditation and prayer, he sought to gird up
his soul for the life-work before him."—"The Desire of Ages,"
p. 102.
                                 [63
    6. "In preparing the way for Christ's first advent, he [John]
was a representative of those who are to prepare a people for
our Lord's second coming. The world is given to self-indulgence.
Errors and fables abound. Satan's snares for destroying souls
are multiplied. All who would perfect holiness in the fear of'God,
must learn the lessons of temperance and self-control. The appe-
tites and passions must be held in subjection to the higher powers
of the mind. This self-discipline is essential to that mental
strength and spiritual insight which will enable us to understand
and to practice the sacred truths of God's Word. For this reason
temperance finds its place in the work of preparation for Christ's
second coming."—Id., p. wr.

revealed God. The symbol chosen for the representation of the
Deity was a lowly shrub, that seemingly had no attractions. This
enshrined the Infinite. The all-merciful God shrouded His glory
in a most humble type, that Moses could look upon it and live.
So in the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night,
God communicated with Israel, revealing to men His will, and
imparting to them His grace. God's glory was subdued, and His
majesty veiled, that the weak vision of finite men might behold
it. So Christ was to come in 'the body of our humiliation,' in the
likeness of men.' In the eyes of the world He possessed no beauty
that they should desire Him; yet He was the incarnate God, the
light of heaven and earth. His glory was veiled, His greatness
and majesty were hidden, that He might draw near to sorrowful,
tempted men."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 23.
    2. Inasmuch as Christ was to be manifested to the world as
the "promised Seed" of Abraham (Gal. 3: 16), the evangelists
traced His ancestry on the human side, back to Abraham, and
so established His identity as the Messiah. Matthew, therefore,
                               [8]
begins with Abraham, and follows the genealogy down through
David to Joseph, the reputed father of Christ. Matt. I : 1-16. By
this he proves that Jesus is the heir of the everlasting covenant
made with Abraham and renewed to David. Gen. 17: 7; 2 Sam.
7: 12-17; Isa. 9: 6, 7.
    3. The word "taxed" in the text comes from a word meaning
to register or enroll. In such registrations, it was necessary for
each person to report for enrollment in the ancestral town. Jos-
eph and Mary being both lineal descendants of David, they must
repair to the "city of David" to be enrolled, according to the de-
cree of the Roman emperor, whose subjects they were.
    4. Note the poverty in which Jesus was born. Why was this?
"For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though
He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that ye through
His poverty might be rich." 2 Cor. 8: 9. He had everything in
the universe; for "all things were created by Him, and for Him."
Col. I : 16. He could have retained these riches, and His equality
with the Father, if He had wished. But He did not count that "a
thing to be grasped," but "emptied Himself," and took upon Him
the form of a servant. Phil. 2: 6-8, R. V. So we through His
poverty are made rich. The "unspeakable riches of Christ" are
ours, if we accept Him. We are "joint heirs with Jesus Christ."
 In Him we have a "right to the tree of life." "Behold, what
manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should
be called the sons of God." 1 John 3: I.

     Dan. 12: so. Note 6.
                               NOTES
    s. The Bible clearly teaches the ministry of angels. Heb. 1 :
13, 14. How often we read of these heavenly messengers' appear-
ing to men engaged at their appointed tasks!
                               [10]
    "A guardian angel is appointed to every follower of Christ.
These heavenly watchers shield the righteous from the power of
the wicked one. . . . The angels appointed to minister to the
children of God have at all times access to His presence."—"The
Great Controversy," pp. 512, 513.
    2. "Behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall
be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David
a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord." This is the gospel; for
"gospel" means good news; or good tidings. "Jesus" means "Sav-
iour," and He was so called because He saves His people from
their sins. Matt. 1:21. "Sin is the transgression of the law."
   John 3: 4. Therefore the gospel is the good news that men can
be saved from sin, and brought into perfect harmony with God.
It does not simply save men from the consequences of sins com-
mitted,, but from sin itself—from the transgression of the law.
The gospel "is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that
believeth." Rom. 1: 16. Peter addresses those "who are kept by
the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be re-
vealed in the last time." i Peter 1: 5. Kept from what by the
power of God?—Kept from falling. Jude 24. Kept from falling
into sin and condemnation, for the Saviour will present us fault-
less 'before the presence of His glory.
    3. The offering might be a lamb and a •turtledove if the par-
ents were rich, and two doves or two pigeons if they were poor.
The mention of the "pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons"
indicates the worldly condition of Mary and Joseph; they came
with the offering of the poor. Thus the poverty of our Lord was
declared in the most striking manner during His infancy.
    4. "Our mother Eve waited for the coming of Christ; when
her first son was born, she said, 'I have gotten a man from the
Lord.' True she was mistaken id what she said; it was Cain,
and not Jesus. But by her mistake we see that she cherished the
blessed hope. That Hebrew patriarch who took his son, his only
son, to offer him for a burnt offering, expected the Messiah; and
well did he express his faith when he said, 'My son, God will
provide Himself a lamb.' He who once had a stone for his
pillow, the trees for his curtain, the heaven for his canopy, and
the cold ground for his bed, expected the coming of Jesus; for
he said on his deathbed—'Until Shiloh come.' The lawgiver of
Israel, who was 'king in Jerusalem,' spake of Him; for Moses said,
'A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your
brethren, like unto me; Him shall ye hear.' David celebrated
Him in many a prophetic song—the Anointed of God, the King
of Israel; Him to whom all kings shall bow. and all nations call
Him blessed. How frequently does he in his psalms sing about
'my Lord' ! 'The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou at My right
hand, until 'I make Thine enemies Thy footstool.' But need we
stop to tell you of Isaiah, who spake of His passion, and 'saw His
glory'? of Jeremiah, of Ezekiel, of Daniel, of Micah, of Malachi,
and of all the rest of the prophets, who stood with, their eyes
strained, looking through the dim mists of futurity, until the
weeks of prophecy should 'be fulfilled—until the sacred day should
arrive, when Jesus Christ should come, in the flesh? They were
all waiting for the consolation of Israel. And, now, good old
Simeon, standing on the verge of the period when Christ would
come, with expectant eyes looked out for Him."—"The Biblical
Illustrator," vol. 1, pp. 207, 208.
     5. "The priest went through the ceremony of his official work.
He took the child in his arms, and held it up before the altar.
After handing it back to its mother, he inscribed the name 'Jesus'
on the roll of the first-born. Little did he think, as the babe lay
in his arms, that it was the Majesty of Heaven, the King of Glory.
. . . In the temple the Son of God was dedicated to the work He
had come to do. The priest looked upon Him as he would upon
any 'other child. But though he neither saw nor felt anything
unusual, Gods act in giving His Son to the world was acknowl-
edged."—"The Desire of Ages," pp. 52, 55.
    6. Might not all God's children have known of the coming of
Jesus as well as Simeon and Anna? The prophecies concerning
His corning might have been understood by all, but sin and tul-
belief had blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts. It will
be the same at the second coming of Christ. A few will be wait-
ing for Him, but many will be unmindful of the approaching
event. (See Dan. 12:

                          LESSON 4

   The Visit of the, Wise Men; Flight
               into Egypt
                       January 24, 1925
LESSON SCRIPTURES: Matt. 2: 1-23; Luke 2: 40-52.
LESSON HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pp. 59-83.
MEMORY TEXTS: Ps. 34: 7; Matt. 2: 6.
PLACES: Bethlehem; a country in "the East"; Jerusalem; Egypt; Nara-
   reth.
PERSONS: The infant Jesus; Herod; the Magi; Joseph and Mary; an
   angel of the Lord.
                   SETTING OF THE LESSON
   "The wise men had seen a mysterious light in the heavens upon
that night when the glory of God flooded the hills of Bethlehem.
As the light faded, a luminous star appeared, and lingered in the
                               [12]
sky. It was not a fixed star nor a planet, and the phenomenon
excited the keenest interest. That star was a distant company of
shining angels, but of this the wise men were ignorant. Yet they
were impressed that the star was of special import to them.. . .
Through dreams they were instructed to go in search of the new-
born Prince. . . . The report of the angels' visit to the shepherds
had been brought to Jerusalem, but the rabbis had treated it as
unworthy of their notice. They themselves might have found
Jesus, and might have been ready to lead the Magi to His birth-
place."-"The Desire of Ages," pp. 6o, 62.
                           QUESTIONS

    his anxiety, what did the king do? Verses 3, 4. Note 2.
3. What information did the priests and scribes give the king?
    Upon what authority could they make such a reply? Verses
    5, 6. Note 3.
4. What further specific information did Herod seek from the
    wise men? What instruction did the king give to the wise
    men, and with what pretended motive? Verses 7, 8. Note 4-
5. What supernatural guidance assisted the wise men to locate
    the place where Jesus was? When they had found the Sav-
    iour, what did these men do? Verses 9-11.
6. What caused the wise men to disregard the instruction of the
    king? Verse 12.
7. Following the departure of the wise men, wkat instruction did
    God give to Joseph? What protection did Joseph seek in
    making this journey? Verses 13, 14. Note 5.
8. Until what time did they remain in Egypt? What prophecy
    refers to this experience? Verse 15. Note 6.
.9. When Herod saw that he had been deceived by the wise men,

 • age of twelve, to what special privilege was Jesus entitled?
    Verses 41, 42.
17. Returning from the feast, through what experience did Joseph
    and Mary pass? Where did they find Jesus? Verses 43-47.
18. How did Mary gently reprove Jesus? What was His answer?
    Why must Joseph and Mary have thought this a strange reply?
    Verses 48-50.
19. What example of dutiful obedience did Jesus set? What is
    said of His further development? Verses 51, 52.
                             NOTES
    T. "That star was a distant company of shining angels, but of
this the wise men were ignorant. Yet they were impressed that
the star was of special import to them. They consulted priests
and philosophers, and searched the scrolls of the ancient records.
The prophecy of Balaam had declared, 'There shall come a star
out of Jacob, and a scepter shall rise out of Israel.' Could this
strange star have been sent as a harbinger of the Promised One?
The Magi had welcomed the light of heaven-sent truth ; now it
was shed upon them in bright rays. Through dreams they were
instructed to go in search of the new-born Prince. . . .
   "The eastern country abounded in precious things, and the
Magi did not set out empty-handed. It was the custom to offer
presents as an act of homage to princes or other personages of
rank, and the richest gifts the land afforded were bofne as an
offering to Him in whom all the families of the earth were to be
blessed. It was necessary to journey by night in order to keep
the star in view; but the travelers beguiled the hours by repeat-
ing traditional sayings and prophetic utterances concerning the
One they sought. At every pause for rest they searched the
prophecies • and the conviction deePened that they were divinely
guided. While they had the star before them as an outward sign,
they had also the inward evidence of the Holy Spirit, which was
impressing their hearts, and inspiring them with hope. The jour-
ney, though long, was a happy one to them."—"The Desire of
Ages," pp. 6o, 6.r.
   2. "The arrival of the Magi was quickly noised throughout
Jerusalem. Their strange errand created an excitement among
the people, which penetrated to the palace of King Herod. The
wily Edomite was aroused at the intimation of a possible rival.
Countless murders had stained his pathway to the throne. Being
of alien blood, he was hated by the people over whom he ruled.
His only security was the favor of Rome. But this new prince
had a higher claim. He was born to the kingdom."—Id., pp. 61, 62.
   3. It seems strange that the first intimation of the Messiah's
advent received by many of the Jews who professed to look for
Him as their King, should be given through strangers from a far
                               [14]
country. It is not so strange that they were troubled when the
thought was forced upon them that they had so neglected the
Word concerning the time and the place of the Saviour's advent,
that God would not give them additional means of such knowl-
edge, but sought repositories of that truth among the gentiles.
Thus God has ever done, and will still do, by those who become
careless in the truth already committed to them.
    Although the priests had become so absorbed in worldly mat-
ters as to lose sight of the time of the Messiah's advent, they
quickly turned to their neglected prophecies, and established' the
birthplace of their long-heralded King.
    4. Herod sought from the wise men information as to how
long since the star was first seen by them, evidently with the pur-
pose in view which he soon carried out. His edict to slay the
children of Bethlehem covered all under two years of age, "ac-
cording to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise
men." Matt. 2: 16.
    5. God could, by a miracle, have preserved the young child
from Herod's malice without His having been removed from
Judea. But in all His dealings in behalf of men, their cooperation
is sought, that they may have responsibility, and consequent in-
terest in what is being done for them. Joseph was therefore
commissioned to have a care for the infant Saviour.
    6. Of the flight, and its duration, Scripture gives us no full
particulars; telling us only that the family fled by night from
Bethlehem, and returned when Joseph had been assured by a
dream that it would be safe to take the Saviour back to the
land of His nativity. We are not told where the family abode in
Egypt, nor how long their exile continued. The evangelist alludes
only to the cause of their flight and of their return, and finds
in the latter a new and deeper significance for the words of the
prophet Hosea, "Out of Egypt have I called My Son."
    That the prophecy "might be fulfilled." The prophecy had
said, "When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and-called My
Son out of Egypt." Hosea II : 1. "Israel" means a prince of God.
As the Son of God, Christ was, and is, the "Prince of God" in the
fullest sense. As the "Seed" of Abraham, He was a child; and as
the great Antitype of Israel, He must go into Egypt, and be again
called forth to live temporarily in the promised land, as did Abra-
ham and his children in the flesh. Nothing was omitted from the
life of Christ which would tend to associate Him with the house
of Abraham, and prove Him to be the promised "Seed" through
whom the promises were to come to Israel.

    Reports from both home and foreign fields show that during
a recent quarter, nearly 21,000 persons studied the Sabbath school
lesson daily. Were you one of them? There were also over
31,009 persons who were present and on time every Sabbath.

    John, son of Zacharias and Elisabeth, was six months older
than Jesus. He "was in the deserts" (Luke I : 8o), not barren
sands, but the wild, rocky, thinly inhabited region along the west-
ern shores of the Dead Sea and the river Jordan. "The wilder-
ness experience was John's college and professional course for his
life-work. He was not a self-made man, but a God-made man."
    "Tidings of the wilderness prophet, and his wonderful an-
nouncement, spread throughout Galilee. . . . In Nazareth it was
told in the carpenter shop that had been Joseph's, and One recog-
nized the call. His time had come."—"The Desire of Ages," p. log.

    the people to receive Him? Mal. 4: 5, 6; Rev. 14: 6-1o.

                              NOTES
    T. "Pharisee and Sadducee, scribe and soldier, priest and pub-
lican, all thronged to listen to his [John's] words. The place
where he preached was that wild range of uncultivated and un-
tenanted wilderness which stretches southward from Jericho and
the fords of Jordan to the shores of the Dead Sea. The cliffs that
overhung the narrow defile which led from Jerusalem to Jericho
were the haunt of dangerous robbers; the wild beasts and the
crocodiles were not yet extinct in the reed beds that marked the
swellings of Jordan; yet from every quarter of the country—from
priestly Hebron, from holy Jerusalem, from smiling Galilee—they
came streaming forth, to catch the accents of this strange voice."
—"The Life of Christ," Farrar, pp. 79, 80.
   2. "John proclaimed the coming of the Messiah, and called
the people to repentance. As a symbol of cleansing from sin, he
baptized them in the waters of the Jordan. Thus by a significant
object lesson he declared that those who claimed to be the chosen
people of God were defiled by sin, and that without purification
of heart and life they could have no part in the Messiah's king-
dom."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 104.
   "Repentance and the kingdom of heaven were the two cardi-
nal points of his [John's] preaching, and though he did not claim
the credentials of a single miracle, yet while he threatened detec-
tion to the hypocrite and destruction to the hardened, he prom-
ised also pardon to the penitent and admission into the kingdom
of heaven to the pure and clean. 'The two great utterances,' it
has been said, 'which he brings from the desert, contain the two
capital revelations to which all the preparation of the gospel
                               [17]
 has been tending. Law and prophecy; dentinciation of sin and
 promise of pardon; the flame which consumes and the light which
 consoles—is not this the whole of the covenant?' "—"The Life of
 Christ," Farrar, p. 87.
    3. "John the Baptist in his desert life was taught of God. He
 studied the revelations of God in nature. Under the guiding of
 the divine Spirit, he studied the scrolls of the prophets. By day
 and by night, Christ was his study, his meditation, until mind and
 heart and soul were filled with the glorious vision.
    "He looked upon the King in His beauty, and self was lost
sight of. He beheld the majesty of holiness, and knew himself to
be inefficient and unworthy. It was God's message that he was to
declare. It was in God's power and His righteousness that he
was to stand. He was ready to go forth as Heaven's messenger,
unawed by the human, because he had looked upon the Divine.
He could stand fearless in the presence of earthly monarchs, be-.
cause with trembling he had bowed before the King of kings.
    "With no elaborate arguments or finespun theories did John
declare his message. Startling and stern, yet full of hope, his
voice was heard from the wilderness, 'Repent ye; for the kingdom
of heaven is at hand.' With a new, strange power it moved the
people. The whole nation was stirred. Multitudes flocked to the
wilderness."—"Testimonies," vol. 8, pp. 331, 332.
    4. "And the words of that voice were like a hammer to dash
in pieces the flintiest heart, like a flame to pierce into the most
hidden thoughts.         . The whole people he warned that their
cherished privileges were worse than valueless if, without repent-
ance, they regarded them as a protection against the wrath to
come. They prided themselves upon their high patriarchal de-
scent ; but God, as He had created Adam out of the earth, so
even out of those flints upon the strand of Jordan was able to
raise up children unto Abraham. They listened with accusing con-
sciences and stricken hearts ; and since he had chosen baptism as
his symbol of their penitence and purification, 'they were bap-
tized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins.' "—"The Life of
Christ," Farrar, p. 80.
    5. "John was acquainted with the events that had marked the
birth of Jesus. He had heard of the visit to Jerusalem in His
boyhood, and of what had passed in the school of the rabbis. He
knew of His sinless life, and believed Him to be the Messiah ;
but of this he had no positive assurance. The fact that Jesus had
for so many years remained in obscurity, giving no special evi-
dence of His mission, gave occasion for doubt as to whether He
could be the Promised One. The Baptist, however, waited in
faith, believing that in God's own time all would be made plain.
It had been revealed to him that the Messiah would seek baptism
at his hands, and that a sign of His divine character should then
be given. Thus he would be enabled to present Him to the people."

           The Temptation of yesus
                       February 7, 1925
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Matt. 4: 1-11; Mark 1: 12, 13; Luke 4: 1-13.
LESSON HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pp. 114-131.
MEMORY TEXTS: Matt. 4: 4, 7, 10.

                   SETTING OF THE LESSON
   "At the Saviour's baptism, Satan was among the witnesses."—
"The Desire of Ages," p. 116.
   "Mighty issues for the world were at stake in the conflict be-
tween the Prince of Light and the leader of the kingdom of dark-
ness. After tempting man to sin, Satan claimed the earth as his,
and styled himself the prince of this world. . . . Christ had come
to disprove Satan's claim. As the Son of man, Christ would stand
loyal to God. Thus it would be shown that Satan had not gained
complete control of the human race, and that his claim to the
world was false."—Id., pp. 114, 115.

14. What promie may we claim when tempted? t Cor. to: 13.
    Note 6.
                              NOTES
     I. "When Jesus was led into the wilderness to be tempted, He
 was led by the Spirit of God. He did not invite temptation. He
 went to the wilderness to be alone, to contemplate His mission
 and work. By fasting and prayer He was to brace Himself for
 the blood-stained path He must travel. But Satan knew that the
 Saviour had gone into the wilderness, and he thought this the best
 time to approach Him."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 114.
     2. Forty days before, at His baptism, a voice from heaven had
 said, "Thou art My beloved Son." Now, in the solitude of the
 wilderness, with only wild beasts for companions, pale and emaci-
 ated from a long fast, and suffering the pangs of hunger, will His
 faith rest on that word spoken to Him a few days before? Satan
 seized the opportunity to insinuate a doubt of the truthfulness of
 that statement, hoping thereby to cause 'a failure of the plan of
 salvation. To doubt would be to disprove His sonship. If this
 plan does not carry, Christ may attempt to prove His sonship by
 obeying the dictates of Satan, and so take Himself out of the
 keeping power of God. He feels quite sure that on one or the
other of these lines Christ will fail.
    3. Three reasons may be given: (t) Jesus was hungry, and
needed nourishment. (2) He was able to turn the stones into
bread. (3) His sonship was challenged.
    "Satan was seeking a dispute with Jesus concerning His being
 the Son of God. He referred to His weak, suffering condition,
and boastingly affirmed ,that he was stronger than Jesus. But
the word spoken from heaven, 'Thou art My beloved Son; in
Thee I am well pleased,' was sufficient to sustain Jesus through
all His sufferings. I saw that Christ had nothing to do in. con-
vincing Satan of His power, or of His being the Saviour of the
world. Satan had sufficient evidence of the exalted station and
authority of the Son of God. His unwillingness to yield to
 Christ's authority had shut him out of heaven."—"Early Writ-
ings," pp. 155, 156, latest edition,.
    4. Christ does not in this case attempt to argue the matter.
That would be to descend to a level with His tormentor. He
quietly said, "Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God." It is one
thing to trust Him while doing His will, and another to try Him
while presumptuously taking a course He has not prescribed.
Jesus said in effect, God can rescue Me from this position, and I
still trust Him.
                               [20]
   5. These words, .spoken by way of command to Satan when he
openly revealed himself, gave him the evidence which he pre-
tended to be seeking. In them was manifested the pOwer which
he feigned to doubt was with Christ. The effect of :their power
was quickly felt by Satan, and he left without another attack
upon the Son of God. •
   6. "We may resist temptation, and force Satan to depart from
us. Jesus gained the victory through submission and faith in God,
and by the apostle He says to us, 'Submit yourselves therefore to
God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Draw nigh to
God, and He will draw nigh to you.' We can not save ourselves
from the tempter's power; he has conquered humanity, and when
we try to stand in our own strength, we shall becorne a prey to
his devices ; but 'the name of the Lord is a Strong tower ; the
righteous runneth into it, and is safe.' Satan trembles and flees
before the weakest soul who finds refuge in that mighty name."—

                             LESSON 7
The First Disciples; the First Miracle;
Cleansing the Temple; the Passover Feast
                         February 14, 1925
LESSON SCRIPTURE: John 1: 35-49; 2.
LESSON HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pp: 138-165.
MEMORY TEXTS: John 2: 5, 19-21.
PLACES: Near the Jordan; Cana and Capernaum; cities of Galilee; Je-
   rusalem.
PERSONS: John the Baptist; Jesus; Andrew; Simon; Philip; Nathanael;
   Mary, mother of Jesus; the 'wedding guests; ruler of the feast; servants;
   sellers of sheep and oxen; money changers.

                     SETTING OF THE LESSON
   The First Disciples: The preaching of John the Baptist at-
tracted the attention of the Jewish rulers. A delegation of rabbis
was sent to question him. John's words indicated plainly that the
long-looked-for Messiah had come. John the second time di-
rectly pointed out Jesus as the One of whom he had preached.
    The First Miracle: "From the Jordan, Jesus had returned to
Galilee. There was to be a marriage at Cana, a little town not
far from Nazareth; the parties were relatives of Joseph and
Mary; and Jesus, knowing of this family gathering, went to
Cana, and with His disciples was invited to the feast."—"The De-
sire of Ages," P. 144.
                                    [21]
    Cleansing . the Temple: "'The Jews' Passover was' at hand,
and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.' In this journey, Jesus joined
one of the large companies that were making their way to the
capital. He had not yet publicly announced His mission, and He
mingled unnoticed with the throng. Upon these occasions, the
coming of the Messiah, to which such prominence had been given
by the ministry of John, was often the theme of conversation."-
Id., p. 154.
                            QUESTIONS
 i. How .was the attention of two of John's disciples directed to
    Jesus? John I : 35-37.

    sionary work did Andrew then undertake? Verses 40-42.
4. How were two more disciples chosen? Verses 43-46.
5. What convinced Nathanael that Jesus was the Son of God?
    Verses 47-49. Note I.
6. What followed the choosing of the first five disciples? Who
    are mentioned as being invited to the marriage? John 2: I, 2.
7. What circumstance caused the mother of Jesus to appeal to
    Him? What was His reply? Verses 3, 4. Note 2.
8. What direction did His mother give to the servants? What
    instructions did Jesus then give? Verses 5-8.
9. What did the ruler of the feast say to the bridegroom con-
    cerning the new wine? Verses 9, 1o.
Io. What is said of this miracle? How did it affect the disciples
    of Jesus? Verse IL Note 3.
is. At the time Jesus performed this miracle, what great feast
    was at hand? Where did Jesus go? What condition did He
    find in the temple? Verses 13, 14. Note 4.
12. What did He immediately do? With what, words did He
    accompany this demonstration? Verses 15, 16.
13. What scripture did His manner and words bring to the minds
    of the disciples? Verse 17.
14. What question did the Jews ask? Verse 18.

    the Jews? Of what temple did Jesus speak? Verses 19-21.
    Note 5.
16. What reassuring effect was produced in the hearts of the dis-
    ciples after the resurrection, when this incident was recalled?
    Verse 22.
17. What was the result of this visit to Jerusalem? Verse 23.

    knowledge had He of man? Verses 24, 25. Note 6.
                               [22]
                              NOTES
    1. "With the calling of John and Andrew and Simon; of
Philip and Nathanael, began the foundation of the Christian
church. John directed two of his disciples to Christ. Then one,
of these, Andrew, found his brother, and called him to the Sav-
iour. Philip was then called, and he went in search of Nathanael.
These examples should teach us the importance of personal effort,
of making direct appeals to our kindred, friends, and neighbors.
There are those who for a lifetime have professed to be ac-
quainted with Christ, yet who have never made a personal effort
to bring even one soul to the Saviour. They leave all the work
for the minister. He may be well qualified for his calling, but he
can not do that which God has left for the members of the
church. There are many who need the ministration of loving
Christian hearts. Many have gone down to ruin who might have
been saved, if their neighbors, common men and women, had put
forth personal effort for them. Many are waiting to be personally
addressed. In the very family, the neighborhood, the town where
we live, there is work for us to do as missionaries for Christ.
If we are Christians, this work will be our delight."—"The Desire
of Ages," p. 141.
    2. "'Woman, what have I to do with thee?' The words at
first sound harsh, and almost repellant in their roughness and
brevity; but that is the fault partly of our version, partly of our
associations. He does not call her 'mother,' because in circum-
stances 'such as these, she was His mother no longer; but the
address 'woman' was so respectful that it might be, and was,
addressed to the queenliest, and so gentle that it might be, and
was, addressed at the tenderest moments to the most fondly
loved."—"The Life of Christ," Farrar,. p. 119. For similar in-
stances of the use of the word "woman," see John 19 : 26; 20:
13, 15.
    "'What have I to do with thee?' is a literal version of a
common Aramaic phrase, which, while it sets aside a suggestion
and waives all further discussion of it, is yet perfectly consistent
with the most delicate courtesy and the most feeling considera-
tion."—Il'id.
    "There was danger that Mary would regard her relationship
 to Jesus as giving her a special claim upon Him, and the right,
in some degree, to direct Him in His mission. For thirty years
 He had been to her a loving and obedient son, and His love was
unchanged; but He' must now go about His Father's work. As
 Son of the Most High, and Saviour of the world, no earthly ties
must hold Him from His mission, or influence His conduct"—
"The Desire of Ages," p.
    3. Jesus when on earth was both the Son of God and the•Son
 of man. This miracle manifested forth the glory, the goodness,
 the power, with which God clothed His Son, who "emptied Him-
                                [23]
self" to save humanity. In this, Jesus was declaring His Father.
John I.: 18. His miracles when on earth were to help others, not
Himself. Not a single thread of selfishness was seen in His life.
    4. "It was early in the morning, yet large crowds were already
repairing to the temple. As Jesus entered, He was indignant to
find the court of the temple arranged as a cattle market and a
place of general traffic. There were not only stalls for beasts, but
there were tables where the priests themselves acted as money
brokers and exchangers. It was customary for each person who
attended the Passover to bring a piece of money, which was paid
to the priests upon entering the temple. . . . Many came from a
great distance and could not bring their sacrificial offerings. Un-
der the plea of accommodating such persons, in the outer court
were cattle, sheep, doves, and sparrows for sale at exorbitant
prices."—"Spirit of Prophecy," vol. 2, pp. 115, 116.
    5. By comparing this scripture with Matt. 26: 6r, 62, we see
that false witnesses, in order to secure Jesus' condemnation, per-
verted the statement, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I
will raise it up." They quoted Him in a way that made Him
appear to say that He would destroy the temple building. Instead
of this, He told them to destroy His body, and in three days He
would rise from the dead.
    6. The meaning of this text seems to be that Jesus received
none of these into the circle of His personal followers. No one
from about Jerusalem, in fact, was to be thus privileged. He
chose no scribes, no rabbis, no men of high standing from that
region. On the other hand, His disciples, to whom He committed
Himself to the end of His life, with the single exception of Judas,
were Galileans. Knowing what is in all men, He knew whom to
choose for the'successful issue of His earthly work. Working
through these humble men, the glory would be given to God. (See
   Cor. 1 : 26-31.)

                   SETTING OF THE LESSON
    After cleansing the temple, Jesus spent the rest of the day
healing the sick and ministering to the people. Nicodemus had
watched Jesus all that day. He had also studied the prophecies
relating to the Messiah. Nicodemus was a member of the San-
hedrin, the highest Jewish council. (See "The Desire of Ages,"
pp. 167, 168.)
                            QUESTIONS

    What did he say? John 3: I, 2. Note I.
2. What reply did Jesus make? Verse 3.
3. What further question revealed the perplexity of Nicodemus?
    Verse 4.
4. With what words did Jesus explain His first statement?
    Verses 5, 6.-
5. What illustration did Jesug use to teach the new birth?
    Verges 7, 8. Note 2.
6. How did Nicodemus show his astonishment? What did
    Jesus say in kindly reproof? Verses 9, so. Note 3.
7. How did Jesus try still further to make Nicodemus know that
    if he could not understand the work of Christ upon the hearts
    of the people, he could not understand the nature of the king-
    dom of heaven? Verses 11-13.
8. To what memorable incident in the history of ancient Israel
    did Jesus refer as a type of His own great sacrifice? Verses
    14, 15. Note 4.
9. With what measure does Jesus estimate the love of His Fa-
    ther? For what purpose did the Son of God come into the
    world? Verses 16, 17.
10. How does faith or unbelief affect those whom He came to
    save? Verse 18.
 r. What brings condemnation to the world? How are light and
    darkness manifest? Verses 19-21.
12. What effect did this interview have upon Nicodemus? Note 5.
13. Where did Jesus and His disciples then go? What did He
    do? Where was John the Baptist at this time, and what was
    he doing? Verses 22-24.
54. What question arose between John's disciples and the Jews?
    Verse 25. Note 6.
15. What report was brought to John concerning Jesus? Verse 26.
16. How did John reveal his true greatness     his reply? Verses

    teachers? Verses 31-33.
19. In His testimony to the world, whose words was Christ to
    speak? What was given to Him without measure? Verse 34.
20. How much has the Father given into the hands of Christ,
    and for what reason? Verse 35.
21. What is the final result of belief or unbelief? Verse 36.
                              NOTES
    1. "Nicodemus held a high position of trust in the Jewish
nation. He was highly educated, and possessed talents of no
ordinary character, and he was an honored member of the na-
tional council. With others, he had been stirred by the teach-
ing of Jesus. Though rich, learned, and honored, he had been
strangely attracted by the humble Nazarene. The,Iessons that had
fallen from the Saviour's lips had greatly impressed him, and he
desired to learn more of these wonderful truths."—"The Desire
of Ages," p. 167.
    2. "The wind is heard among the branches of the trees, rus-
tling the leaves and flowers; yet it is invisible, and no man knows
whence it comes, or whither it goes. So with the work of the
Holy Spirit upon the heart. It can no more be explained than can
the movements of the wind. A person may not be able to tell the
exact time or place, or to trace all the circumstances in the process
of conversion; but this does not prove him to be unconverted. By
an agency as unseen as the wind, Christ is constantly working
upon the heart. Little by little, perhaps unconsciously to the re-
ceiver, impressions are made that tend to draw the soul to Christ.
These may be received through meditating upon Him, through
reading the Scriptures, or through hearing the word from the
living preacher. Suddenly, as the Spirit comes with more direct
appeal, the soul gladly surrenders itself to Jesus. By many this
is called sudden conversion ; but it is the result of long wooing
by the Spirit of God,—a patient, protracted process."—Id., p. 172.
    3. " 'Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these
things?' Jesus asked. Surely one entrusted with the religious in-
struction of the people should not be ignorant of truths so im-
portant. His words conveyed the lesson that instead of feeling
irritated over the plain words of truth, Nicodemus should have
had a very humble opinion of himself, because of Iris spiritual
ignorance. Yet Christ spoke with such solemn dignity, and both
look and tone expressed such earnest love, that Nicodemus was
not offended as he realized his humiliating condition."—Id., p. 173.
    4. "Nicodemus had read these scriptures with a clouded mind ;
but he now began to comprehend their meaning. He saw that the
most rigid obedience to the mere letter of the law as applied to
the outward life, could entitle no man to enter the kingdom of
heaven. In the estimation of men, his life had been just and
                                [26]
honorable; but in the presence of Christ he felt that his heart
was unclean, and his life unholy. . . . Nicodemus received the
lesson, and carried it with him. He searched the Scriptures in
a new way, not for the discussion of a theory, but in order to
receive life for the soul. He began to see the kingdom of heaven
as he submitted himself to the leading of the Holy Spirit."—
Id., pp. 174, 17.5.
    5. "The words spoken at night to one listener in the lonely
mountain were not lost. For a time Nicodemus did not publicly
acknowledge Christ, but he watched His life, and pondered His
teachings. In the Sanhedrin council he repeatedly thwarted the
schemes of the priests to destroy I-Iim."—Id., p. 176.
    6. "A question arose between them and the Jews as to whether
baptism availed to cleanse the soul from sin; they maintained that
the baptism of Jesus differed essentially from that of John. Soon
they were in dispute with Christ's disciples in regard to the form
of words proper to use at baptism, and finally as to the right of
the latter to baptize at all."—Id., p. 178.
    7. "Though John's mission seemed about to close, it was still "
possible for him to hinder the work of Christ. If he had sympa-
thized with himself, and expressed grief or disappointment at
being superseded, he would have sown the seeds of dissension,
would have encouraged envy and jealousy, and would seriously
have impeded the progress of the gospel.
    "John had by nature the faults and weaknesses common to
humanity, but the touch of divine love had transformed him. He
dwelt in an atmosphere uncontaminated with selfishness and am-
bition, and far above the miasma of jealousy. He manifested no
sympathy with the dissatisfaction of his disciples, but showed how
clearly he understood his relation to the Messiah, and how gladly
he welcomed the One for whom he had prepared the way."—
Id. p. 179.
   '8. "He must increase, but I must decrease." Jesus pro-
nounced John the greatest of all prophets. John's confession
reveals the secret of that greatness. John knew his work, he
knew his message, and he knew his time and place. With this
he was satisfied. Human like all other men, however, there was
much in his mission that Might appeal to the natural heart. He
could have been a rival of . Christ, for many took him to be the
Messiah or a great prophet. Ambition might have made him a
pretender, and helped him snatch a crown, found a rabbinical
school, or start some other movement of his own. He pleased
not himself, however, but lived only to fulfill his divine mission.
He shunned popularity, hated the flattery and praise of men, was
humble, unselfish, free from envy or jealousy, ready at all times
to submerge himself that his Lord might be magnified.' He was
faithful and true unto prison and unto death ; and the light of
his mission has shone undimmed through all the dark intervening
centuries to the present day.

            The Woman of Samaria

LESSON SCRIPTURE: John 4: 1-42.
LESSON HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pp. 183-195.
MEMORY TEXTS: John 4: 13, 14, 24, 36.
PLACES: Judea; Samaria; Galilee; Sychar, thought to be the ancient
   Shechem between Mount Ebal and Mount Gerizim.
PERSONS: Jesus and His disciples; Pharisees; the woman of Samaria; the
   Samaritans.
                  SETTING OF THE LESSON
    The land of Palestine was divided into three parts. Judea was
the southern portion, Samaria the central, and Galilee the north-
ern. To go from Judea to Galilee, Jesus must pass through Sa-
maria. The Samaritans were a mixed race, having descended
from the remnant of Israel which had intermarried with the
heathen sent from the East to settle in Palestine after the ten
tribes were carried away into captivity. The Samaritans offered
to help rebuild the temple, but the Jews refused their help. The
Samaritans then tried to hinder the work. Afterwards they built
a rival temple on Mount Gerizim, where they offered sacrifices
after the manner commanded by Moses, though they did not en-
tirely give up idolatry. The Jews and the Samaritans were bitter.
enemies, and avoided all dealing with each other.
                            QUESTIONS
1. Because of the strife over His own work and that of John,
   what did Jesus do? Through what country did He pass?
   John 4: 1-4.
2. Near what city in Samaria did Jesus halt? For what purpose?
   What historical object was there? Verses 5, 6. Note r.
3. While Jesus was resting, who came to the well? What did
   Jesus ask of the woman? Verse 7.

                              NOTES
   1. Jacob's well was made famous by the meeting of Jesus
with the woman of Samaria at that place. "This is one of the
very few spots in Palestine which have been closely identified
with our Saviour's presence. It is about half a mile north from
Joseph's tomb, at the base of Mount Gerizim. Maundress, in 1697,
found the depth of the well to be 105 feet, with fifteen feet of
water. Captain Anderson, who visited it in 1866, found it to be
only seventy-five feet. It may have been twice that depth origi-
nally. When visited by Farrar in 187o, it was only about twenty
feet deep, and was in a state of hopeless ruin."—"Popular and
Critical Bible Encyclopedia."
   2. As water is necessary to temporal life, so the "living water"
which Jesus alone can supply is necessary to everlasting life. "He
who seeks to quench his thirst at the fountains of this world,
will drink only to thirst again. Everywhere men are unsatisfied.
They long for something to supply the need of the soul. Only
One can meet that want. The need of the world, 'the desire of
                               [29]
all nations,' is Christ. The divine grace which He alone can im-
part; is as living water, purifying, refreshing, and invigorating
the soul."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 187.
    3. Like the Jews, this woman was resting contented and se-
cure in a formal religion. She had been taught by her traditions
that the Messiah was to come, and it was the hope of the Samari-
tans that He would do for their nation in the way of worldly
greatness and honor what the Jews were expecting for theirs.
    4. Such is the effect of simple witness borne for Christ. We
would scarcely have selected this woman as the one to bring a
revival of godliness to the wicked village of Sychar. The secret
of her success lies in the fact that she had a face-to-face talk with
the Saviour. This changed her life from one of sin to one of
righteousness. Before we can bring souls to the Lord, we, too,
must have a personal interview with Jesus, and experience a trans-
formation of life.

LESSON SCRIPTURES: John 4: 43-54; Luke 4: 16-30; Mark 1: 14, 15;
   Matt. 4: 12-17.
LESSON HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pp. 196-200, 236-240.
MEMORY TEXTS: Ps. 50: 15; Luke 4: 18, 19.
PLACES: Three cities in Galilee; Cana, a village up in the hills; Caper-

PERSONS: Jesus; the nobleman and his child; the Jews at Nazareth.

                    SETTING OF THE LESSON
    Jesus and His disciples were on their way from Judea to Gali-
lee. The journey was interrupted by a two days' visit with the
Samaritans to whom Jesus had been introduced by the woman
at Jacob's well.
    At Nazareth, Jesus again met His mother, His brothers, and
the neighbors and friends whom He had known from childhood.
    "All eyes were turned upon Him as He entered the synagogue
upon the Sabbath day, and took His place among the worshipers.
. . . When a rabbi was present at the synagogue, he was ex-,
                                  [30]
pected to deliver the sermon, and any Israelite might give the
reading from the prophets. Upon this Sabbath Jesus was re-
quested to take part in the service."-"The Desire of Ages," p. 236.

18. What lesson may we learn from the experience of the Jewish

                              NOTES
  i. While Nazareth was the scene of our Lord's childhood,
Capernaum was long the home of His manhood. Matt. 4: 13-; 9:
                                [31]
The Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke present chiefly our
Lord's ministry in Galilee; while the Gospel of Joshn records His
ministry in Judea. The parables recorded in John, and in the
other three Gospels, correspond to the features of Judea and
Galilee respectively. The vineyard, the fig tree, the shepherd, and
the desert where the man fell among thieves, were appropriate in
Judea; the cornfields (Mark 4:28), the merchants and fisheries
 (Matt. 13: 45, 47), and the flowers (Matt. 6:28), suited Galilee.
    2. The word rendered "nobleman" in John 4: 46 is somewhat
varied in signification in the original. "It may mean: (I) De-
scended from a king. (2) One belonging to the court. (3) A
soldier of the king, in which latter sense it often occurs in Jose-
phus. (4) Well born, used in the parable of the talents (Luke
Igo : 12) as a title of the person who placed his servants in charge
of certain amounts, for which they were to be held accountable."
—"Popular and Critical Bible Encyclopedia."
    3. "Is not this Joseph's son?" The wisdom and power with
which He spoke, and the gracious utterances which fell from His
lips, greatly impressed the people, and unbelief began to give way.
But they hardened their hearts. They remembered that He was
"Joseph's son," and that He was a "carpenter," and therefore
reasoned that He could not be the Son of God.
    4. What was the actual cause of the sudden outburst of wrath
on the part of these auditors? It was that their self-esteem was
wounded. Jesus declared that only the humble and meek would
be able to receive Him. Elijah was persecuted, and was received
only by one poor widow. Naaman was unworthy to be healed
until he humbled himself to dip in the despised Jordan. The men
of Nazareth understood the inference.. It was not flattering to
their pride; they could not be fed and healed unless they became
humble, and accepted the Son of God as their Saviour. This they
would not do—and they cast Him out of their city.
    5. "The assembly broke up, and laying hands upon Jesus, they
thrust Him from the synagogue, and out of the city. All seemed
eager for His destruction. They hurried Him to the brow of a
precipice, intending to cast Him down headlong. Shouts and
maledictions filled the air. Some were casting stones at Him,
when suddenly He disappeared from among them. The heavenly
messengers who had been by His side in the synagogue were with
Him in the midst of that maddened throng. They shut Him in
from His enemies, and conducted Him to a place of safety. . .
From what dangers, seen and unseen, we have been preserved
through the interposition of the angels, we shall never know, until
in the light of eternity we see the providences of God."—"The
Desire of Ages," p. 240.
    6. "The Jewish leaders were filled with spiritual pride. . . .
Because their understanding was darkened by selfish prejudice,
they could not harmonize the power of Christ's convicting words
                                [32]
with the humility of His life. They did not appreciate the fact
that real greatness can dispense with outward show. .      . It was
not simply the absence of outward glory in His life that led the
Jews to reject Jesus. He was the embodiment of purity, and they
were impure. He dwelt among men an example of spotless in-
tegrity. His blameless life flashed light upon their hearts. His
sincerity revealed their insincerity. It made manifest the hollow-
ness of their pretentious piety, and discovered iniquity to them
in its odious character. Such a light was unwelcome."—Id., pp.
242, 243.

MEMORY TEXTS: Acts 10: 38; Luke 4: 36; Isa. 53: 4, 5.
PLACES: The synagogue in Capernaum; Simon Peter's house.,
PERSONS: Jesus; the demoniac; Peter's wife's mother; the people.

                    SETTING OF THE LESSON
    Capernaum, on the shores of the Sea of Galilee, was well
adapted to be the center of Jesus' work in that country. "Being
on the highway from Damascus to Jerusalem, and Egypt, and
to the Mediterranean Sea, it was a great thoroughfare of travel."
While at Cana, Jesus had spoken the word that reached to Ca-
pernaum and healed the sick son of the nobleman. Now Jesus
visits Capernaum, and "when it was known that the Teacher
Himself was among them, the whole city was aroused. Multi-
tudes flocked to His presence. On the Sabbath the people crowded
the synagogue until great numbers had to turn away, unable to
find entrance."—"The Desire of Ages," pp. 252, 253.
                             QUESTIONS
 I. To what city of Galilee did Jesus again come? What caused
    the people to wonder? Luke 4 : 31, 32.
2. What unfortunate person was in the synagogue and heard
    Jesus preaching? How was he affected by His words?
    Verses 33> 34. Note I.
3. Who, in reality, spoke by this man's voice? Note 2.
                                  [33]
  4. How did Jesus address the unclean spirit? With what result?
     Verse 35.
  5. How did this miracle affect those who knew of it? What
     question did they ask? Verse 36. Note 3.
  6. How far was the news of this miracle spread? Verse 37.

     result? Verse 39.
  9. At the close of the Sabbath, who came to Jesus? What did
     He do for them? Verse 4o. Note 4.
 10. From what affliction were many delivered? What did the
     evil spirits cry out on leaving their victims? How did Jesus
     deal with these demon spirits? For what reason? Verse 41.
11. What did Jesus do early the next morning? Who followed
     Him? What did they say to Him? Mark I : 35-37. Note 5.
12. What did Jesus say He should then do? How did He con-
     tinue His work? Verses 38, 39.
13. What was the burden of Jesus' teaching in Galilee? Verses
     14, 15. (Compare Dan. 9:24-26.)
14. Where was John the Baptist at this time? Matt. 4: 12.
15. Where 4c1 Jesus make His home after leaving Nazareth?
     Verse
16. What prophecy was Jesus fulfilling in His preaching? Verses
     14-16.
17. From that time, what message did Jesus emphatically pro-
     claim? Verse 17.
                               NOTES
    I. "The secret cause of the affliction that had made this man a
fearful spectacle to his friends and a burden to himself, was in
his own life. He had been fascinated by the pleasures of sin,
and had thought to make life a grand carnival. He did not dream
of becoming a terror to the world and the reproach of his family.
He thought his time could be spent in innocent folly. But once
in the downward path, his feet rapidly descended. Intemperance
and frivolity perverted the noble attributes of his nature, and
Satan took absolute control of him."-"The Desire of Ages," p.
256.
    2. "The mind of this wretched sufferer had been darkened by
Satan, but in the Saviour's presence a ray of light had pierced
the gloom. He was roused to long for freedom from Satan's
control; but the demon resisted the power of Christ. When the
man tried to appeal to Jesus for help, the evil spirit put words
into his mouth, and he cried out in an agony of fear. The
demoniac partially comprehended that he was in the presence of
                               [34]
One who could set him free; but when he tried to come within
reach of that mighty hand, another's will held him; another's
words found utterance through him. The conflict between the
power of Satan and his own desire for freedom was terrible."—
Id., pp. 255, 256.                                            •
    3. In this incident, the people beheld another manifestatioff of
the power of Jesus. Other evidences of His power over evil
spirits may be listed as follows : "He gives the apostles and dis-
ciples power to 'cast out devils' (Luke 9: 1), and to •tread on 'all
the power of the enemy' (Luke Jo: 19). In Mark 9 : 29 He dis-
tinguishes a certain class of demons that can only be driven out
by prayer and fasting. In Luke II : 18-20 He explains the facility
with which He casts out demons by the personal victory which
He had achieved over Satan at the beginning. He therefore ad-
mitted the intervention of this being in these mysterious condi-
tions."—"The Biblical Illustrator," vol. 1, p. 454•
    4. From this verse, some have understood that it was the cus-
tom of Jesus not to heal on the Sabbath, which accounted for the
people's bringing their sick to Him after the Sabbath had closed.
But this was because of their own incorrect understanding of
proper Sabbath observance, and through fear of their teachers,
whose oppressive traditions prohibited any work of this nature.
    To the contrary, Jesus (lid heal on the Sabbath, as in the case
of the cripple at the pool of Bethesda (John 5: 1-18). He taught
that it was right to do works of mercy on the Sabbath. On an-
other occasion, He healed a man with a withered hand in the
synagogue (Matt. 12: 10-12), and used that occasion to show
*hat real Sabbath keeping meant, and to rebuke their hypocrisy.
     5. "In a life wholly devoted to the good of others, the Saviour
 found it necessary to withdraw from the thoroughfares of travel
and from the throng that followed Him day after day. He must
turn aside from a life of ceaseless activity and contact with human
needs, to seek retirement and unbroken communion with His
 Father. As one with us, a sharer in our needs and weaknesses,
 He was wholly dependent upon God, and in the secret place of
 prayer He sought divine strength, that He might go forth braced
 for duty and trial. In a world of sin, Jesus endured struggles and
 torture of soul. In communion with God He could unburden the
 sorrows that were crushing Him. Here He found comfort and
  joy."—"The Desire of Ages," pp. 362, 363.

MEMORY TEXTS: Luke 5: 11; Mark 1: 40-42.
PLACES: By the Sea of Galilee, sometimes called Tiberias, or the Lake of
   Gennesaret; Galilee.
PERSONS: Jesus; Simon Peter and his brother Andrew; James and John
   and their father Zebedee; the multitude; the leper.
                    SETTING OF THE LESSON
   "Day was breaking over the Sea of Galilee. The disciples,
weary with a night of fruitless toil, were still in their fishing boats
on the lake. Jesus had come to spend a quiet hour by the water
side. In the early morning He hoped for a little season of rest
from the multitude that followed Him day after day."—"The
Desire of Ages," p. 244.
   There were many lepers in Palestine. News that Jesus was
healing the sick reached the lepers, but most of them "dared not
expect Jesus to do for them what He had never done for any
man." One leper began to hope, and at last determined to find
his way to the Healer of whom it was said that He turned none
away.

15. What was the result of not heeding this counsel? Mark I : 45.
i6, As leprosy is a type of sin, how does this lesson encourage
      the greatest sinner? Note 4.
                                 NOTES
     i. ".Until this time none of the disciples had fully united as
colaborers with Jesus. They had witnessed many of His miracles,
and had listened to His teaching; but they had not entirely for-
saken their former employment!—"The Desire of Ages," p. 246.
     2. "They were humble and unlearned men, those fishers of
Galilee; but Christ, the light of the world, was abundantly able to
qualify them for the position for which He had chosen them.
The Saviour did not-despise education; for when controlled by
the love of God, and devoted to His service, intellectual -culture
is a blessing. But He passed by the wise men of His time, because
they were so self-confident that they could not sympathize with
suffering humanity, and become colaborers with the Man of
Nazareth. In their bigotry they scorned to be taught by Christ.
The Lord Jesus seeks the cooperation of those who will become
unobstructed channels for the communication of His grace. The
first thing to be learned by all who would become workers to-
gether with God, is the lesson of self-distrust; then they are pre-
pared to have imparted to them the character of Christ. This is
riot to be gained through education in the most scientific schools.
 It is the fruit of wisdom that is obtained from the divine Teacher
alone.
       `.Jesus chose unlearned fishermen because they had not been
schooled in the traditions and erroneous customs of their time.
 They were men of native ability, and they were humble and teach-
able,—men whom- He could educate for His work. In the common
 walkS of life there is many a man patiently treading the round of
 daily toil, unconscious that he possesses powers which, if called
 into action, would raise him to an equality with the world's most
 honored men: The touch of a skillful hand is needed to arouse
 those dormant faculties. It ,was such men that Jesus called to be
 His. colaborers ;. and He -gave them the advantage of association
 With •Hilliselfir Never- had'tlie World's 'great 'Men such a- teacher.
 Wheri.the disciples-came forth* from -the Saviour's trahliifg;they
 were no longer ignorant and - uncultured. .They had' become like
 Him in mind and character, and men took knowledge of them
 that they had been with Jesus."—Id., pp. 249, 250.
                                  [37]
    3. "Of all diseases known in the East the leprosy was most
dreaded. Its incurable and contagious character, and its horrible
effect upon its victims, filled the bravest with fear. Among the
Jews it was regarded as a judgment on account of sin, and hence
was called, 'the stroke,' the finger of God.' Deep-rooted, in-
eradicable, deadly, it was looked upon as a symbol of sin."—"- The.
Desire of Ages," p. 262.
    "it must, indeed, have required on the part of the poor wretch
a stupendous faith to believe that the young Prophet of Nazareth
was One who could heal a disease of which the worst misery was
the belief that, when once thoroughly seated in the blood, it was
ineradicable and progressive."—"The Life of Christ," Farrar,
   195.
    4. "The work of Christ in cleansing the leper from his terrible
diseaSe is an illustration of His work in cleansing the soul from
sin. . . . But in laying His hand upon the leper, Jesus received
no defilement. His touch imparted life-giving power. The leprosy
was cleansed. Thus it is with the leprosy of sin,—deep-rooted,
deadly, and impossible to he cleansed by human power. . .        In
the case of leprosy, no sooner was the appeal made than it was
granted. When we pray for earthly blessings, the answer to our
prayer may be delayed, or God may give us something other than
we ask, but not so when we ask for 'deliverance from sin."—"The
Desire of Ages," p. 266.

 I  N the hearts of all men there are inexpressible
     longings for something they do not have. The
     purpose of this book is to set forth Jesus Christ as
  the One in whom every longing may be satisfied.
     There are many books written on the life of
  Christ, setting forth large stores of information,
  elaborate chronologies, customs, and events, as well
  as much of the teaching of the Saviour. It is not the.
  purpose of this work to present a harmony of the
  Gospels or to recount in strictly chronological order
  the important events in'the life of Christ. The book
  is not written to satisfy the desire of the merely
  curious or to answer the questionings of critics ; its
  purpose is to present, the love of the Father as re-
  vealed in His Son, and the divine beauty of the life
. of Christ, of which we may all partake. As a lesson
  help, "Desire of Ages" is indispensable.
                Order of your tract society.
