                    SETTING OF THE LESSON
   Jesus again visits Capernaum, and we are told by the spirit
of prophecy that He was teaching in the house of Peter, His
disciples sitting by Him. The condition of the palsied man is
thus portraYed: "This paralytic had lost all hope of recovery.
His disease was the result of a life of sin, and his sufferings were
embittered by remorse."—"The Desire of Ages," p. z67.
                    Suggestions for Daily Family Study
    1. Read the "Setting of the Lesson." Read Mark 2: 1.12. Read seven
paragraphs of the primary lesson story in "Our Little Friend." Drill on
the children's memory verse.
    2. Let the story of the healing of the palsied man be told, by each member
of the family contributing a part. Note omitted details in the story-telling.
Study Notes 1-4, as sidelights on the story. Memorize Mark 2:17.
    3. Read selected portions of the Lesson Help, pp. 267-271. Name the
persons mentioned in the story of healing, telling what each one said or
did. Review the memory text.
    4. Read Mark 2: 13-17; Luke 5: 27-32. Ask questions on that portion
of the lesson, from youth's, junior, or' primary lesson. Study Note 5.
    5. Review the story of Levi-Matthew. Read selected portions of the
Lesson Help, pp. 272-276.
    6. Study Questions 16, 17, and Notes 6, 7. Read paragraphs 8-10 of
the primary lesson in "Our Little Friend." Read selected portions of the
Lesson Help, pp. 276-280. Review the memory text.
    7. Review the entire•lesson. Use questions in the senior lesson, or in
the youth's lesson in "The Youth's Instructor." Discuss the special questions
under "Sonic Things to Think About" in the junior lesson. Make sure
that the children can tell the lesson story in a connected way.
   NOTE: "Suggestions. for Daily Family Study" have been prepared
for a family with children and youth, where all divisions of the Sabbath
school are represented. Less complete family groups will naturally make
adjustments in the outline to meet their needs.

                             NOTES
   1. The "Pharisees and doctors of the law" mentioned in
Luke 5: 17 were of the rabbis or "masters" in Israel. They were
called "scribes" from the Hebrew saphar (to write). They were
also called "lawyers," and "doctors of the law," because they
taught the law to the people. The large majority of them were
Pharisees, though not all rabbis were Pharisees, nor all Pharisees
                              [4]
rabbis. On this occasion,. they came as spies,—emissaries from
those who hated Jesus.
    2. Eastern' houses are, in many ways, very different from ours.
but in no way more strikingly so than in the lightness of the
roof. It is easy to break/ up an Oriental roof when necessary,
and it is often done. The bed in common use' in Oriental coun-
tries was but a straw mat or rug.
     3. According to Oriental usage, the name "son" used by
Jesus could very fittingly be applied to a person as much as
thirty years of age,
     4. "It required nothing less than creative power to restore
health to that decaying body. The same voice that spoke life
to man created from the dust of the earth, had spoken life to
the dying paralytic. And the same power that gave life to the
body, had renewed the heart. He- who at the creation 'spake,
and it was,' who 'commanded, and it stood fast,' had spoken life
to the soul dead in trespasses and sins. The healing of the body
was an evidence of the power that had renewed the heart."—"The
Desire of Ages," p. 270.
     5. The publicans were Roman tax collectors, usually Jews.
They were despised and hated above all men, being regarded as
 traitors against their country and robbers of their own country-
 men. (See "The Desire of Ages," page 272.)
     6. "The disciples of John were at this time in great sorrow.
It was before their visit to Jesus with John's message. Their
 beloved teacher was in prison, and they passed their days in
 mourning. . . . The Pharisees and John's disciples were fasting
 when the latter came to Jesus with the inquiry, 'Why do we and
 the Pharisees fast oft, but Thy disciples fast not?' Very
 tenderly Jesus answered them. He did not try to correct their
 erroneous conception of fasting, but only to set them right in
 regard to His own mission. And He did this by employing the
 same- figure that the Baptist himself had used in his testimony to
 Jesus. John had said, 'He that hath the bride is the bridegroom;
 but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth
  him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this
 my joy therefore is fulfilled.' The disciples of John could not
  fail to recall these words of their teacher, as, taking up the illus-
 tration, Jesus said, 'Can ye make the children of the bridechamber
  fast, while the bridegroom is with them?' "—"The Desire of
  Ages," pp. 276, 277.
      7. "The faitlf that works by love and purifies the soul, could
  find no place for union with the religion of the Pharisees, made
  up of ceremonies and the injunctions of men. The effort to unite
  the teachings of Jesus with the established religion would be vain.
  The vital truth of God, like fermenting wine, would burst the
  old, decaying bottles of the Pharisaical tradition."—Id., p. 279.

                             LESSON 2
HEALING THE INFIRM MAN AT BETHESDA
             April 11, 1925
LESSON SCRIPTURE: John 5:1-24.
MEMORY TEXT: John 5:24.
LESSON HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pp. 201-213.
PLACE: The pool of Bethesda in Jerusalem.
PERSONS: Jesus; the sick lying at the pool of Bethesda; the infirm man;
  the Jews.
                   SETTING OF THE LESSON
    "Jesus was again at Jerusalem. Walking alone, in apparent
meditation and prayei, He came to the pool. He saw the wretched
sufferers-watching for that which they supposed to be their only
chance of cure. He longed to exercise His healing power, and
make every sufferer whole. But it was the Sabbath day. Multi-
tudes were going to the temple for worship, and He knew that
such an act of healing would so excite the prejudice of the Jews
as to cut short His work. But the Saviour saw one case of
supreme wretchedness. It was that of a man who had been a
helpless cripple for thirty-eight years."—"The Desire of Ages,"
p. 201.

                             NOTES
   I. "At certain seasons the waters of this pool were agitated,
and it was commonly believed that this was the result of super-
natural power, and that whoever first after the troubling of the
pool stepped into the waters, would be healed of whatever disease
he had. Hundreds of sufferers visited the place; but so great was
the crowd when the water was troubled that they rushed forward,
trampling underfoot men, women, and children, weaker than
themselves. Many could not get near the pool. Many who
succeeded in reaching it, died upon its brink."—"The Desire of
Ages," p. ao.r.
   2. "From the simple Bible account of how Jesus healed the
sick, we may learn something about how to believe in Him for
the forgiveness of sins. Let us turn to the story of the paralytic
at Bethesda. The poor sufferer was helpless; he had not used
his limbs for thirty-eight years. Yet Jesus bade him, 'Rise, take
up thy bed, and walk.' The sick man might have said, 'Lord, if
Thou wilt make me whole, I will obey Thy word.' But no, he
believed Christ's word, believed that he was made whole, and
                                71
he made the effort at once ; he willed to walk, and he did walk.
He acted on the word of Christ, and God gave the power. He
was made whole.
   "In like manner you are a sinner. You can not atone for your
past sins, you can not change your heart, and make yourself
holy. But God promises to do all this for you through Christ.
You believe .that promise. You confess your sins, and give
yourself to God. You will to serve Him. Just as surely as you
do this, God will fulfill. His word to you. If you believe the
promise,—believe that you are forgiven and cleansed,—God
supplies the fact; you are made whole, just as Christ gave the
paralytic power to walk when the man believed that he was healed.
It is so if you believe it."—"Steps to Christ," chapter "Faith
and Acceptance."
   3. "Jesus had purposely chosen the Sabbath day upon which
to perform the miracle at the pool. .. . A wise purpose underlay
every act of Christ's life on earth; everything He did was
important in itself and its teaching. . . . The Sabbath, instead of
being the blessing it was designed to be, had become a curse
through the added requirements of the Jews. Jesus wished to
rid it of these incumbrances and leave it standing upon its own
holy dignity. Therefore He chose the Sabbath for this special
work."—"Spirit of Prophecy," vol. 2, pp. 161, 162.
   4. Christ was persecuted by the Jews, who would have put
Him to death at once if they could have had their way. The
contest always has been, and still is, between God's way and man's
way. Now a controversy about the Sabbath question has been
entered upon, which will end only in the effort to put to death
those who will not yield to the demand that they keep the
Sabbath according to man's command (Rev. 13: 15) ; but God will
work deliverance for His people. Read the book of Esther upon
this subject, especially chapters 3, 8, and 9.

   I. It was not counted wrong, ordinarily, to pluck and eat all
 the grain one's hunger demanded; nor was the journey on that
 day accounted wrong, since the Pharisees themselves were in the
 company. It was, however, considered wrong by these fault-
 finders to satisfy hunger in that way on the Sabbath, but only
 by a law of their own, making.
    2. "Jesus did not let the matter pass with administering a
 rebuke to His enemies.... Their many heartless rites could not
supply the lack of that truthful integrity and tender love which
 will ever characterize the true worshiper of God."—"The Desire
of Ages," pp. 285, 286.
    3. The Sabbath was made for man. It was designed of God
to be a blessing, not a hardship nor a curse. It is neither a
burden nor a yoke, but a helpful friend. All this is pledged in
the fact that the Son of man is Lord of the Sabbath.
    4. According to Matthew, the Pharisees first asked, "Is it
lawful to heal on the Sabbath days?" Their emphasis was on
the fact of the mere work. Jesus puts the question on the true
basis, "Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath days, or to do evil?
to save life, or to kill?" Then, by an illustration drawn from their
own practice, He shows the emptiness of their zeal. They would
help a sheep or an ox in distress, but would suffer a man to die.
No wonder that the heart of Jesus was indignant at such
inhumanity and disregard of the true nature of God's service.
He did not break the Sabbath. It is lawful always to do well: on
the Sabbath day. It was not a vindictive anger which came to
the Master. His soul was grieved at the hardness of their
impenitent hearts.
    5. The inconsistency in the profession of the Pharisees is
shown in the following statement: "They were hunting His life
with bitter hatred, while He was saving life, and bringing
happiness to multitudes. Was it better to slay upon the Sabbath,
as they were planning to do, than to heal the afflicted, as He had
done? Was it more righteous to have murder in the heart upon
God's holy .day, than love to all men, which finds expression in
deeds of mercy?"—"The Desire of Ages," p. 287.

   6. Simon was surnamed Peter, sometimes called Simeon, and
Cephas. John and James He surnamed Boanerges, meaning
"sons of thunder." Matthew is also called Levi. Simon the
Canaanite is also called Zelotes, or the Zealot. Thaddeus is
also called Judas. James "the less" was the son of Alpheus. If
the names of the apostles are placed in groups of threes, they
will be more easily memorized :

                     SETTING OF THE LESSON
    "After the ordination of the apostles, Jesus went with them
to the seaside. Here in the early morning the people had begun
to assemble. . . . Jesus led the way back to the mountain side.
Reaching. a level space that .offered a pleasant gathering place
for the vast assembly, He seated Himself, on .the grass, and the
disciples and the- multitude followed His example.
    "The disciples' place, was always next to Jesus. The people,
constantly pressed upon Him, Vet the disciples' understood that
they were not to       crowded away from 'His pregente."7-"Thi.
Desire of Ages," pp. 298, 299.
    The Beatitudes are usually undeistood to be eight in number.

                                NOTES
   1. "In the Sermon on the Mount, He [Christ] sought to undo
the work that had been wrought by false education, and to give
His hearers a right conception of His kingdom and of His own
character. . . . Without combating their ideas of the kingdom
of God, He told them the conditions of entrance therein, leaving
them to draw their own conclusions as to its nature. The truths
He taught are no less important to us than to the multitude that
                                 [ 1.2 ]
.followed Him. We no less than they need to learn the 'foundation
 principles of the kingdom of God."—"The Desire of Ages,"
 P. 299.
     2. Gfeat blessing and happiness are promised to those who
 walk in the way of righteousness. The path of holiness is the
 way of joy even in this life, and it leads to eternal joys at the end
 of life's journey. The opening words of the first psalm emphasize
 this glorious truth. "Blessed is the man," or, more freely
 rendered, "0 the blessedness of the man that walketh not in the
 counsel of the ungodly, nor- standeth in the way of sinners."
     The "poor in spirit" are those who recognize that they are
 nothing and have nothing outside of Christ. They feel their entire
 dependence upon One who is mighty to save. To them are
 promised the greatest and best of all riches—the kingdom of
 heaven "within you," and "in the world to come, eternal life."
     3. "They that mourn": (t) For their sins. Sorrow for sin
 is the first condition of forgiveness. It is the best assurance that
  the sin will not be willingly repeated. The mourning state is
 blessed because it is a necessary step to the more blessed state
 of forgiveness. (2) For temporal losses. Mourning for a dear
 one that death has taken, or in sympathy with the afflicted, or
 even for property loss, mellows the spirit, and tends to lead the
 mourner to sorrow for sin. And there is comfort for the
 sorrowing from the "God of all comfort."
     4. True meekness comes from Christ. "It is the love of self
 that destroys our peace. While self is all alive, we stand ready
 continually to guard it from mortification and insult; but when
 we are dead, and our life is hid with Christ in God, we shall not
 take neglects or slights to heart. We shall be deaf to reproach,
 and blind to scorn and insult. . . . The meekness of Christ,
 manifested in the home, will make the inmates happy; it provokes
 no quarrel, gives back no angry answer, but soothes the irritated
 temper, and diffuses a gentleness that is felt by all within its
 charmed circle."—"Thoughts. from the Mount of Blessing," pp.
31, 32, new edition.
     5. Hunger is one of the strongest cravings of human nature.
 Men have become so overpowered by it that they have taken
 human life to relieve it; but thirst is even more, intense. Men
 go insane from thirst. Men sometimes live without food for
 many days, but they can live only a short time without water.
 These characteristics of our physical needs should teach us the
 importance of supplying our spiritual sustenance. Does our
 body need bread?—More than this our souls need the bread of
 life. Does the physical man call for water?—Infinitely more
 do we need the water of life. But if we hunger and thirst, the
  Great Provider will abundantly supply our need.
     6. "The merciful are 'partakers of the divine nature,' and in
 them the compassionate love of God finds expression. All whose
                                [13 1
hearts are in sympathy with the heart of Infinite Love will seek ,
to reclaim, and not to condemn."—"Thoughts from the Mount
of Blessing," p. 39.
    7. "The peacemakers." Where contention and strife and
irritability make life miserable, the one who possesses the gift
of composing differences, who has the happy faculty of "pouring
oil on the troubled waters," has indeed a blessed ministry. The
world is so full of unrest and conflict that peacemakers are
needed everywhere, in the home, in the church, in the community.
Every person who has found peace ought to be a peacemaker.
    8. "While slander may blacken the reputation, it can not stain
the character. That is in God's keeping. So long as we do not
consent to sin, there is no power, whether human or satanic, that
can bring a stain upon the soul. A man whose heart is stayed
upon God is just the same in the hour of his most afflicting trials
and most discouraging surroundings as when he was in prosperity,
when the light and favor of God seemed to be upon him."—
"Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing," p. 52.
    g. Salt is a preservative, and is therefore used as a symbol
here. God's church, instead of bringing calamity upon the world,
preserves the world. Ten good persons in Sodom would have
kept it from destruction.

17. What high standard of character is placed before us?
   Verse 48.
                               NOTES
     1. Taken in its broadest sense, the expression, "the law and the
 prophets," would include all the Old Testament, and must,
 therefore, include the Ten Commandments, which are the sum of
 all moral requirements, and because of the transgression of which
all ceremonial precepts and ordinances came into existence. "The
 prophets" include all the Heaven-sent instructions reproving God's
 people for the transgression of the law, and expounding its great
 truths, and explaining its exceeding breadth and depth and
 height. That Jesus referred to the great moral law is shown in
 His reference to two of its commandments. (See Matt. 5: 21, 27.)
 William W. McLane, Ph. D., D. D., well says in the Homiletic
 Review of October, tgo8 : "Christ did not come to destroy the
law or the prophets, but to fulfill by obedience both in His own
person and in the person of all who believe and obey. . . . God
in Christ and in His cross fulfills His own law of love and most
graciously compels forgiven men to fulfill the same law."
     2. In the Hebrew, the jots and tittles are employed to add the
vowel sounds ; but to some extent, these are left out in the printing
of Hebrew and Yiddish literature. Headlines in the Yiddish
papers are always unpointed, and students of the Hebrew or the
Yiddish readily read either of these languages unpointed. Some
shorthand systems leave out the vowels to a great extent. The
educated Jew reads his words without the little vowels (tittles)
quite as easily as with them. They are Therefore the most
unimportant thing in the language. The yod is next, being
partly a vowel also. But the teaching of the Saviour is that
not even the least important part of the law—"the jots and the
tittles, so commonly omitted—would pass away until all things
were fulfilled.
     3. "When one who professes to serve God wrongs or injures
a brother, he misrepresents the character of God to that brother,
and the wrong must be confessed, he must acknowledge it to be
sin, in order to be in harmony with God. Our brother may have
done us a greater wrong than we have done him, but this does
not lessen our responsibility. If when we come before God we
remember that another has aught against us, we are to leave our
gift of prayer, of thanksgiving, of freewill offering, and go to
the brother with whom we are at variance, and in humility confess
our own sin, and ask to be forgiven."—"Thoughts from the Mount
of Blessing," pp. 91, 92.
     4. "Verses 25, 26 contain another argument by an example
for putting an end as soon as possible to all angry feelings, and
settling everything that may lead to crime. 'Agree with,' come
to an agreement, settle your difficulty. 'Thine adversary.' The one
                                [16 ]
who has a grievance against you, that he is carrying to the law
courts. Do not let anger, which has been shown to be so danger- ,
ous, prevent or delay you. Do it quickly, for a time will come
when it will he too late, and you must suffer the full conse-
quences. The uttermost farthing, that is, 'fourth thing,'—here
the fourth part of a Roman as, a small brass coin worth about a
quarter of a cent. It is right and wise to apply this truth to your
own personal relations with God."—Peloubet.
    5. Adultery includes cherishing lustful thoughts. If our
thoughts are pure, our words and acts will be pure. Unchaste
language, words, and expressions that suggest evil thoughts,
should be scrupulously avoided. They are corrupting in their
influence upon others, and give evidence of a' corrupt heart;
"for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh."
Matt. t2: 34.
    6. The Revised Version, "causeth thee to stumble," is plainer
than "offend thee." We should be willing to sacrifice what is as
dear as the right hand or the right eye, rather than sin against
God. He wants the whole man clean. What is true of the individ-
ual is true of the church. Matt. 18: 8, 9; i Cor. 5: 6, 7.
    7. "I saw that some of God's children have made a mistake
in regard to oath-taking, and Satan has taken advantage of this
to oppress them, and take from them their Lord's money. I
saw that the words of our Lord, 'Swear not at all,' do not touch
the judicial oath. . . . I saw that if there is anyone on earth who
can consistently testify under oath, it is the Christian."—"Testi-
monies," vol. I, pp. tor, 202.
    8. The author of "Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing,"
on pages tog-111, makes the following comment on Matt. 5: 38-42:
    "The whole earthly life of Jesus was a manifestation of this
 principle. It was to bring the bread of life to His enemies that
 our Saviour left His home in heaven. Though calumny and
 persecution were heaped upon Him from the cradle to the grave,
 they called forth from Him only the expression of forgiving
 love.... Jesus bade His disciples, instead of resisting the demands
 of those in authority, to do even more than was required of
 them."

   "In the days of Christ the Pharisees were continually trying
to earn the favor of Heaven, in order to secure the worldly honor
and prosperity which they regarded as the reward of virtue.
At the same time they paraded their acts of charity before the
people in order to attract their attention, and gain a reputation
for sanctity. Jesus rebuked their ostentation."—"Thoughts front

                             NOTES
   1. Matthew 6: I lays down a general principle which is en-
larged upon and applied in the instruction on giving alms,
praying, and fasting. When such deeds are pronipted by wrong
motives, they "have no reward" of our heavenly Father.
                              [ 19 ]
    2. "In the secret place of prayer, where no eye but God's can
see, no ear but His can hear, we may pour out our most hidden
desires and longings to the Father of infinite pity; and in the
hush and silence of the soul, that voice which never fails to
answer the cry of human need, will speak to our hearts."—
"Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing," p. 126.
    3. "The Lord's prayer was twice given by our Saviour, first
to the multitude in the Sermon on the Mount, and again, some
months later, to the disciples alone." This is a model prayer
which Jesus taught His people, suitable for all ages. Note how
much it includes : (I) the address; (2) our relationship to Him ;
 (3) our needs; (4) °Ur character and relation to our. fellows;
 (5) our future safety. "Father" is the home name, an affectionate
and an endearing relation ; "our Father" implies brothers and
sisters ,united in one family of all God's children. "Hallowed."
Holy should the name and character of God be regarded. This
could not be done without becoming like Him.
    4. "Thy kingdom come." Where?—Here, and, first of all,
in our own hearts. No man ever truly prays the prayer if he does
not submit to God's law and does not desire that God shall rule
supreme in his life. It must be personal. "Thy will be done"
in me in the earth.
    5. "Our daily bread." Spiritual as well as physical is here
meant. Man must eat daily of physical food to maintain strength
and vigor. Is not daily feeding upon the Word as necessary for
moral strength and vigor? "Manna from heaven falls fresh every
eve" for God's people now as well as anciently.
    6. "He who is unforgiving, cuts off the very channel through
which alone he can receive mercy from God. We should not
think that unless those who have injured us confess the wrong,
we are justified in withholding from them our forgiveness. It
is their part, no doubt, to humble their hearts by repentance and
confession ; but we are to have a spirit of compassion toward those
who have trespassed against us, whether or not they confess
their faults. However sorely they may have wounded us, we
are not to cherish our grievances, and sympathize with ourselves
over our injuries; but as we hope to be pardoned for our offenses
against God, we are to pardon all who have done evil to us."—
"Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing," p. 166.
    7. "While we are not to be dismayed by trial, bitter though
it be, we should pray that God will not permit us to be brought
where we shall be drawn away by the desires of our own evil
hearts. In offering the prayer that Christ has given, we surrender
ourselves to the guidance of God, asking Him to lead us in safe
paths."—Id., p. 171,
    8. " 'Anoint thine head, and wash thy face.' These were
forbidden in the Jewish canon on 'clays of fasting and humiliation;
                              [ 20 ]
and hypocrites• availed:themselves.: of this ordinance, that they
might,appear to fast."—Clarke.
    g. "Here Christ represents the petitioner as asking that he
may give again. He must obtain the bread, else he can not supply
the necessities of a weary, belated wayfarer. Though his neighbor
is unwilling to be troubled, he will not desist his pleading; his
friend must be relieved; and at last his importunity is rewarded;
his wants are supplied.:. . .
    "But the selfish neighbor in the parable does not represent
the character of God. The lesson is drawn, not by comparison,
but by contrast. A selfish man will grant an urgent request, in
order to rid himself of one who disturbs his rest. But God
delights to give."—"Christ's Object Lessons," pp. 140, 141.

     THE SERMON ON. THE MOUNT—
  THE FATHER'S CARE FOR HIS CHILDREN
                           May 16, 1925
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Matt. 6:19-34.
PARALLEL SCRIPTURES: Luke 11:34-36;- 12:22-34'.
MEMORY TEXT: Matt. 6:33, 34.
LESSON HELPS: "Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing," chapter
  "The True Motive in Service," pp. 133-150; "The Desire of Ages,"
  pp. 312, 313.
PLACE: The mountain side near the Sea of Galilee.
PERSONS: Jesus; the twelve; the multitude.

                     SETTING OF THE LESSON
    The rich and the poor, the high and the tow among men,
were in the company that listened to Jesus as He sat upon the
mount. It is said that "the love of money was the ruling passion
in the Jewish age." So it is now.
    The songsters of the air, the flowers brightening the hillside,
objects visible and familiar to all, were chosen by the Saviour to
illustrate the precious lesson of love and trust which He wished
to teach.
                    Suggestions for Daily Family Study

of Blessing," pp. 141-146, commenting on Matt. 6 : 25-30. Drill on the
memory text.
    4. Study Questions 11-14, and Notes 6-8. Review the lesson by using
questions and notes in the junior lesson. Read "Mount of Blessing," pp.
147-150, commenting on Matt. 6: 33, 34.
    5. Read Matt. 6: 19-34. Call upon each member of the family to give
from memory leading points in the lesson. Refer to Solomon's wealth
as set forth in 1 Kings 10, as a sidelight on verse 29.
   6. Review the study by using the senior lesson, or the youth's ',lesson in
"The Youth's Instructor.       Discuss topics in the junior lesson under the
heading "Something to Think About." Review the memory text.
    7. Review the questions and the notes, seeing that each member of the
family is well drilled in his own lesson.
                               QUESTIONS
 I. Where does Jesus warn us not to place our treasures?
    Matt. 6 : 19.
2. Where should we lay up treasures? Verse 20.
3. What is the result of laying up our treasures in any place?
    Verse 21. Note I.
4. How does Jesus further show the importance of seeking God
    with singleness of purpose and heart? Verses 22, 23. Note 2.
5. How is this principle further illustrated in what is said of
    two different masters? Verse 24. Note 3.
6.. What practical conclusion does Jesus draw from this?
    What is most important? Verse 25. Note 4.
7. What illustration of trust and confidence does Jesus give to
    teach us of the Father's care for us? Verse 26.
8. How much can our thoughts add to our stature? Verse 27.
9. For what else are we not to be anxious? What example of
    trust and beauty is given here? Verses 28, 29. Note 5.
10. What may we conclude from these lessons of God's care?
    Verse 3o.
11. For what should there not be anxious questions in our lives?
    Verse 31.
12. Of whom are such questions characteristic? What great
    Provider knows all our temporal needs? Verse 32. Note 6.
13. What are we commanded to seek first?• What results follow
    such a course? Verse 33. Note 7.
14. How should we relate ourselves to the future? Verse 34.
    Note 8.
                                  NOTES
   1. "In every effort to benefit others, we benefit ourselves. He
who gives money or time for spreading the gospel enlists his own
interest and prayers for the work, and for the souls to be reached
through it; his affections go out to others, and he is stimulated
to greater devotion to God, that he may be enabled to do them
the greatest good."-"Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing,"
P. 135.
                                   [ 22 ]
    2. The direction of the eye shows the purpose of the man, and
the laying up of treasures shows the affections of the heart. He
who has' a single purpose to do God's will and steadfastly looks
to God, will be guided and filled with the light of God. He
whose purpose is turned upon the low, dark ambition of selfish-
ness, worldliness, and sin will become a body of darkness.
    3. "Christ does not say that man will not or shall not serve
two masters, but that he can not.... No one can occupy a neutral
position; there is no middle class, who neither love God nor
serve the enemy of righteousness. .. . The strongest bulwark of
vice in our world is not the iniquitous life of the abandoned sinner
or the degraded outcast; it is that life which otherwise appears
virtuous, honorable, and noble, but in which one sin is fostered,
one vice indulged."—"Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing,"
pp. 130, 140.
    4. Jesus anticipated that some would be tempted to believe
that they can not get clothing or food unless they serve the
world or themselves. His effort in all this instruction is to lead
men to the higher service alone, that of God. Whatever we do,
do it as unto God, and leave results with Him. "Take no thought"
is better expressed in the Revised Version, "Be not anxious."
The word means anxious, troubled, worried thought. So also in.
verses 27, 28, 35, and 34.
    5. "Consider, says Jesus, how the lilies grow ; how, springing
from the cold, dark earth, or from the mud of the river bed, the
plants unfold in loveliness and fragrance. Who would dream of
the possibilities of beauty in the rough brown bulb of the lily?
But when the life of God, hidden therein, unfolds at His call
in the rain and the sunshine, men marvel at the vision of grace
and loveliness. Even so will the life of God unfold in every
human soul that will yield itself to the ministry of His grace,
which, free as the rain and the sunshine, comes with its benedic-
tion to all."—"Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing," P.,144.
    6. It is the gentiles, nations of the world, who seek such things,
whose hopes are only temporal, earthly. The children of God
should have higher objectives. "'Seek ye first the kingdom of
God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added
unto you.' I'have come to open to you the kingdom of love and
righteousness and peace. Open your hearts to receive this
kingdom, and make its service your highest interest. Though it
is a spiritual kingdom, fear not that your needs for this life
will be uncared for. . . .
    "Jesus does not release us from the necessity of effort, but
He teaches that we are to make Him .first and last and best in
everything. We are to engage in no business, follow no pursuit,
seek no pleasure, that would hinder the outworking of His
righteousness in our character and life. Whatever we do, is to
be done heartily, as unto the Lord."—/d., pp. 147,148.
                                [ 23 1
 - 7. This lesson does not in any way indorse laziness. The
Christian will be diligent and industrious. Rom. 12: II ; I Thess.
4: II ; 2 Thess. 3: to-12.
   8. Borrow no trouble for the future. God gives us to-day
strength for to-day's duties, trials, sorrows, evils. We can borrow
no grace for future troubles. How foolish it is, then, to borrow
trouble which we may not meet! The day brings sufficient
anxiety and care. There is always grace for the day. God is a
present help in trouble.

                          QUESTIONS

Ts. How is the wisdom of that man illustrated? Verses 25-27.
     Note 8.
16. How did the teaching of Jesus affect the people.? Verses
    28, 29.
                              NOTES
   I. A "mote" is a speck of dust such as one sees floating in
the sunlight. This little particle is placed in contrast with a
great beam or timber used in building the framework of a house.
How can one with a great beam of wood in his eye see to take
a mere speck from another's eye? Sitting in judgment on others
is one of the greatest of sins. This judging does not refer to
proper church discipline, where the Spirit guides. I Corinthians 5.
   2. "Not until you feel that you could sacrifice your own self-
dignity, and even lay down your life, in order to save an erring
brother, have you cast the beam out of your own eye, so that you
are prepared to help your brother. Then you can approach him,
                              [25 ]
and touch his heart. No one has ever been reclaimed from a
wrong position by censure and reproach; but many have thus
been disiven from Christ, and led to seal their hearts against
conviction. A tender spirit, a gentle, winning deportment, may
save the erring, and hide a multitude of sins."—"Thoughts from
the Mount of Blessing," pp. 184, 185.
   3. The figures are those of casting the flesh of the sacrifice
to dogs, and precious seed pearls, resembling grain, to hogs,
which trample them underfoot and rend the giver. "Jesus here
refers to a class who have no desire to escape from the slavery
of sin. By indulgence in the corrupt and vile, their natures have
become so degraded that they cling to the evil, and will not be
separated from it. The servants of Christ should not allow them-
selves to be hindered by those who would make the gospel only
a matter of contention and ridicule."—Id., p. 186.
   4. It is characteristic of Jesus' teaching to draw upon the
things of common experience to illustrate spiritual truth. Here
He chooses the tenderest of human relations, that of parent and
child, and selects a touching' incident in this relation—a hungry
child asking for something to eat. Parents will and must refuse
some things asked by children, but they do not refuse food to
children when they need it. So our heavenly Father responds to
the cry of him who hungers and thirsts after righteousness.
   5. "In your association with others, put yourself in their place.
Enter into their feelings, their difficulties, their disappointments,
their joys, and their sorrows. Identify yourself with them, and
then do to them as, were you to exchange places with them, you
would wish them to deal with you."—"Thoughts from the Mount
of Blessing," p. 192.
    6. "The way to life is narrow, and the entrance strait. If
you cling to any besetting sin, you will find the way too narrow
for you to enter. Your own ways, your own will, your evil habits
and practices, must be given up if you would keep the way of the
Lord. He. who would serve Christ can not follow the world's
opinions, or meet the world's standard."—Id., p. 198.
    7. "Sheep's clothing" has always been characteristic of false
prophets. Their mission is either to lull the church to sleep
in sin or to lead it away into error. For the former purpose, they
cry, "Peace, peace" (Jer. 6: 13, 14) ; and for the latter, "Lo, here
is Christ, or there" (Matt. 23: 23-26). We may know them by
their fruits, those fruits measured by the law and the testimony.
Isa. 8:20.
   8. "He who, like the Jews in Christ's day, builds on the foun-
dation of human ideas and opinions, of forms and ceremonies
of man's invention, or on any works that he can do independently
of the grace of Christ, is erecting his structure 'of character upon
the shifting , sand."—"Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing,"
p. 216.

                             NOTES
    s. The Jews thought that because the centurion' had built
them a synagogue; Jesus would be more ready to grant the request
made in his behalf. The centurion himself did not consider
that his liberality' gave"him any special claim on the attention
of the Lord. But he was not like many in these days who confess
their unworthiness, and who, therefore,' will not claim anything
from the Lord. ' He said, "Say the word, and` my: servant shall
be healed." A. R. V. He expected blessings in spite of his
unworthiness, and such are the ones who, receive mercies from
God. Jesus was, not influenced by the representations of the Jews.
   2. Jesus regarded the words of the centurion as the most
marvelous manifestation of faith that He had ever seen. Wherein
lay the greatness of the faith?—In the simple fact of grasping the
power of Christ's word. It is such faith as the centurion mani-
fested, and only such,—faith that lays-hold of and rests upon the
power of the living word,—that will give us the kingdom. (See
Matt. 8: 10-12.)
   3. "The centurion said of himself, 'I am not worthy.' His
heart had been touched by the grace of Christ. He saw his own
unworthiness ; yet, he feared not to ask help. He trusted not to
his own goodness; his argument was his great need. His faith
took hold upon Christ in His true character. He did not believe
in Him merely as a worker of miracles, but as the friend and
Saviour of mankind.
   "It is thus that every sinner may come to Christ. 'Not by
works of ,righteousness which we have done, but according to
His mercy He saved us.' When Satan tells you that you are
a sinner, and can not hope to receive blessing from God,
                              [ 28 ]
tell him that Christ came into the world to save sinners. We
have nothing to recommend us to God; but the plea that we may
urge now and ever is our utterly helpless condition, that makes
His redeeming power a necessity. Renouncing all self-dependence,
we may look to the cross of Calvary and say,—
                'In my hand no price I bring;
                Simply to Thy cross I cling.'
—"The Desire of Ages," p. 317.
    4. Read Ps. 103: 13; Isa. 63 : 9; and Heb. 4: 15. In the com-
passion of Jesus for the bereaved and sorrowing mother, we
see the tender pity of God for suffering and sinful men; for
"God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto Himself." 2 Cor.
5: 19. Satan has led men to think that God is stern, exacting, and
tyrannical. Christ "emptied Himself" (Phil. 2: 7, R. V.), that
He might represent only the Father, and so disprove Satan's
slander. "God is love." Who can hesitate to come to Him, when
we know that it was His love and compassion that was manifested
in the gentle .Saviour?
    5. "And He said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise. And
he that was dead sat up, and began to speak," What was it that
put life into the young man? Just the word of Christ, which is
spirit and life. John 6: 63. ' It was the same word that will raise
the dead at the last day. It was the same word that gives life
to the sinner.

                               NOTES
    1. "Like the Saviour's disciples, John the Baptist did not under-
stand the nature of Christ's kingdom. He expected Jesus to take
the throne of David; and as time passed, and the Saviour made
no .claim to kingly authority, John became perplexed and
troubled. . . . He determined to send a message of inquiry to
Jesus."—"The Desire of Ages," pp. 215, 216.
    2. "The Saviour's words, 'Blessed is he, whosoever shall find
none occasion of stumbling in Me,' were a gentle reproof to
John. It was not lost upon him. Understanding more clearly now
the nature of Christ's mission, he yielded himself to God for
life or for death, as should best serve the interests of the cause
he loved."—Id. p. 218.
    3. "The tall reeds that grew beside the Jordan, bending
before every breeze, were fitting representatives of the rabbis
who had stood as critics and judges of the Baptist's mission.
They were swayed this way and that, by the winds of popular
opinion..
    "Jesus wished to direct attention to the contrast between the
clothing of John, and that worn by the priests and rulers. These
officials arrayed themselves in rich robes and costly ornaments.
They loved display, and hoped to dazzle the people, and thus
command greater consideration. They were more anxious to
gain the admiration of men than to obtain the purity of heart
which would win the approval of God. Thus they revealed that
 their allegiance was not given to God, but to the kingdom of this
world."—/d., pp. 218, 219.
     4. John had prophesied of Christ. < "One mightier than I
 cotneth.     . He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost." But
John was more than a prophet. Like Jesus, -he was the fulfill-
 ment of prophecy. Of himself he said, "I am the voice of .one
 crying in the wilderness, . . . as said the prophet Esaias." He
 it was, too, who first publicly proclaimed and pointed out Jesus
 as the Messiah. He also baptized Jesus, when the voice from
 heaven declared His .sonshio.
     5. "In the announcement to Zacharias before the birth of
 John, the angel had declared, 'He shall be great in the sight of
 the Lord.' In the estimation of Heaven, what is it that constitutes
 greatnesse—Not that which the world accounts greatness ; not
 wealth, or rank, or noble descent, .or intellectual gifts, in them-
 selves considered. If intellectual greatness, apart from any higher
 consideration, is worthy of honor, then our homage is due to
 Satan, whose intellectual power 'no man has ever equaled. But
                                 31
when perverted to self-serving, the greater the gift, the greater
curse it becomes. It is moral worth that God values. Love and
purity are the attributes He prizes most."—"The Desire of Ages,"
p. 219.
     6. The meaning of this passage is made clearer in Luke 16: 16:
"The kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into
 it." John's preaching of repentance and of the nearness of the
kingdom of heaven, had stirred the people, and many were pressing
 into the kingdom as if compelled by some unseen force. He had
begun a movement that was continuing and increasing through
the ministry of Jesus. Thus Jesus gave John credit for his
share in the work that Jesus Himself was following up.
     7. The Herod who killed John the Baptist was Herod Antipas,
son of Herod the Great by Malthace, his Samaritan wife. After
the death of his father, he was confirmed by AugustuS as tetrarch
of Galilee and Perea, that is, the southern part of the country
east of the Jordan.
     8. "Herod was astonished and confounded. The riotous
mirth Ceased, and an ominous silence settled down upon the
scene of revelry. The king was horror-stricken at the thought
of taking the life of John. Yet his wort was pledged, and he was
unwilling to appear fickle or rash. The oath had been made in
honor of his guests, and if one of them had offered a word against
the fulfillment of his promise, he would gladly have spared the
prophet. He gave them opportunity to speak in the prisoner's
behalf. They had traveled long distances in order to hear the
preaching of John, and they knew him to be a man without crime,
and a servant of God. But though shocked at the girl's demand,
they were too besotted to interpose a remonstrance. No voice
was raised to save the life of Heaven's messenger. These men.
occupied high positions of trust in the nation, and upon them
rested grave responsibilities ; yet they had given themselves up to
feasting and drunkenness until the senses were benumbed. Their
heads were turned with the giddy scene of music and dancing,
and conscience lay dormant. By their silence they pronounced the
sentence of death upon the prophet of God to satisfy the revenge
of an abandoned woman."—"The Desire of Ages," pp. 221, 222.
     9. ;Tor the sake of thousands who in after years must pass
from prison to death, John was to drink the cup of martyrdom.
As the followers of Jesus should languish in lonely cells, or perish
by the sword, the rack, or the fagot, apparently forsaken, by God
and man, what a stay to their hearts would be the thought that
John the Baptist, to whose faithfulness Christ Himself had borne
witness, had passed through a similar experience. . . . Not
Enoch, who was translated to heaven, not Elijah, who ascended
in a chariot of fire, was greater or more honored than John the
Baptist, who perished alone in, the dungeon,"—Id., pp. 224, 225.

                     SETTING OF THE LESSON •
   "By the Sea of Galilee a company had gathered to see and hear
Jesus,—an eager, expectant throng. The sick were there, lying
on their mats, waiting to present their cases before Him. It
was Christ's God-given right to heal the woes of a sinful race,
and He now rebuked disease, and diffused around Him life and
health and peace."—"Christ's Object Lessons," pp. 33, 34.
   Looking upon this scene, Jesus spoke the parable of the sower.
                 "Sower divine!
                    Sow the good seed in me;
                    Seed for eternity.
                    'Tis a rough, barren soil,
                    Yet, by Thy care and toil,
                    Make it a fruitful field,
                    An htindredfold to yield.
                 Sower divine,

17. What is characteristic of the one who bears fruit? Luke 8: 15.
18. What experience is necessary if one bears "much fruit"?
    John 15): 2, 5.
                              NOTES
   I.   "By this parable Christ was virtually saying to His hearers,
It is not safe for you to stand as critics of My work, or to indulge
disappointment because it does not meet your ideas. The question
of greatest importance to you is, How do you treat My message?
Upon your reception or rejection of it your eternal destiny de-
pends2-"Christ's Object Lessons," Ph. 43, 44•
    2.. Bear in mind, throughout this interpretation, that the seed
represents the "Word of the kingdom," and the soil the heart of
the hearer. The various conditions of the soil indicate conditions
                              [ 34]
of the heart. The fruitage itself represents elements of character,
and deeds of love in the life. This is true not only of the
individual who receives the Word, but also of everyone to whom
he may minister that Word.
    3. "As the birds are ready to catch up the seed from the
wayside, so Satan is ready to catch away the seeds of divine
truth from the soul. He fears that the Word of God may awaken
the careless, and take effect upon the hardened heart. Satan
and his angels are in the assemblies where the gospel is preached.
While angels of heaven endeavor to impress hearts with the Word
of God, the enemy is on the alert to make the Word of no effect.
With an earnestness equaled only by his malice, he tries to thwart
the work of the Spirit of God."—"Christ's Object Lessons,"
P. 44.
    4. "Satan has many helpers. Many who profess to be
Christians are aiding the tempter to catch away the seeds of truth
from other hearts. Many who listen to the preaching of the Word
of God make it the subject of criticism at home. . . . The
message that should be regarded as the Word of the Lord to
them is dwelt upon with trifling or sarcastic comment. The
minister's character, motives, and actions. and the conduct of
fellow members of the church, are freely discussed. . . . Often
these things are spoken by parents in the hearing of their own
children. Thus are destroyed respect for God's messengers,
and reverence for their message."—Id., PP. 45, 46.
    5. The words "forthwith" (verse 5), "anon" (verse 2o),
and "by and by" (verse 21), are variations of the same word in
the original, and mean immediately. It is sometimes translated
elsewhere "straightway."
    6. The word "offended" here, as usually elsewhere in the
Gospels, means caused to stumble, or, more literally still, en-
trapped, ensnared.                                          ti
    7. "It is not because men receive the Word immediately,
nor because they rejoice in it, that they fall away. . . . But those
who in the parable are said to receive the Word immediately, do
not count the cost. They do not consider what the Word of God
requires of them. They do not bring it face to face with all
their habits of life, and yield themselves fully to its control."—
"Christ's Object Lessons," pp. 46, 47.
    8. "`The cares of this world.' No class is free from the
temptation to worldly care. To the poor, toil and deprivation
and the fear of want bring perplexities and burdens. To the
rich come fear of loss and a multitude of anxious cares. Many
of Christ's followers forget the lesson He has bidden us learn
from the flowers of the field. They do not trust to His constant
care. Christ can not carry their burden, because they do not
cast it upon Him. Therefore the cares of life, which should
drive them to the Saviour for help and comfort, separate them
 from Him."—Id., p. jr.
                               [ 35 ]
    9. "The wayside, the stony-ground, the thorny-ground hearers
need not remain such. The Spirit of God, is ever seeking to
break the spell of infatuation that holds men absorbed in worldly
things, and to awaken a desire for the imperishable treasure.
It is by resisting the Spirit that men become inattentive to or
neglectful of God's Word. They are themselves responsible
for the hardness of heart that prevents the good seed from
taking root, and for the evil growths that check its develop-
ment."—Id., p. 56.

                     SETTING OF THE LESSON
    Sitting in the boat on the Sea of Galilee, Jesus continued
to teach the people by parables. "In the East, men sometimes
took revenge upon an enemy by strewing his newly sown -fields
with the seeds of some noxious weed that, while growing, closely
resembled wheat. Springing up with the wheat, it injured the
crop, and brought trouble and loss to the owner of the field."—

to wheat; but when they head out, the grains are black, and easy
to distinguish from wheat.
    2. Of the darnel, it is said that the roots often grow so closely
intertwined with those of the wheat, that the one can not be
pulled up without rooting out the -Other. Not in this life is the
line drawn. The Lord sends rain on the just and the unjust.
But the harvest time is sure to come, and then will come the
separation.
    "Christ has plainly taught that those who persist in open. sin
must be separated from the church; but He has not committed
to .its the work o-f judging character and motive_ He knows our
nature too well to entrust this work to us. Should we try to
                               (   371
uproot from the church thoSe whom we suppose to be spurious
Christians, we should be sure to make mistakes. Often we
regard as hopeless subjects the very ones whom Christ is drawing
to Himself. Were we to deal with these souls according to our
imperfect judgment, it would perhaps extinguish their last hope.
Many who think themselves Christians will at last be found
wanting. Many will be in heaven who their neighbors supposed
would never enter there. Man judges from appearance, but God
judges the heart. The tares and the wheat are to grow together
until the harvest ; and the harvest is the end of probationary
time."—"Christ's Object Lessons," pp. 71, 72.
    3. "The good seed represents those who are born of the Word
of God, the truth. The tares represent a class who are the fruit
or embodiment of error, of false principles."—Id., pp. 70, 71.
    4. "It is from enmity to Christ that Satan scatters his evil
seed among the good grain of the kingdom. The fruit of his
sowing he attributes to the Son of God. By bringing into the
church those who bear Christ's name while they deny His
character, the wicked one causes that God shall be dishonored,
the work of salvation misrepresepted, .and souls imperiled."—
Id., p. 71.
    5. "The wicked are to be utterly destroyed—consumed away
into smoke, brought to ashes. Having inseparably allied them:-
selves with sin, they have forfeited the right to life and an im-
Mortal existence, and chosen:the way of death and destruction.
By their choice they have proved themselves worthless: For this
reason they are 7 coinparpd.:tO::chaff, briers;. thorns,     'Their
destruction will consequently be no real loss. They will themselves
have lost their opportunity to obtain eternal life; but by the way
in which they used their probationary time' they proved themselves
unworthy of it. Their destruction will, in fact, be an act of love
and mercy on the part of God."—"Bible Readings for the Home
Ciycle," p. 522.
    6. "But amid the tempest of divine judgment, the children
of God will have no cause for fear. `The Lord will be the hope
of His people, and the strength of the children of Israel.' The
clay that brings terror and destruction to the transgressors of
God's law, will bring to the obedient, 'joy unspeakable, and full
of glory.' Gather My saints together unto Me,' saith the Lord,
`those that have made a covenant with. Me by sacrifice. And the
heavens shall declare His righteousness; for God is judge
Himself.' "—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 341.
