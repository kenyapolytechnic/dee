                 THE LIFE OF CHRIST
                               LESSON 1
FIVE PARABLES: THE MUSTARD SEED, THE
  LEAVEN, THE TREASURE, THE PEARL,
            THE FISH NET
                              July 4, 1925
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Matt. 13: 31-35, 44-53.
PARALLEL SCRIPTURE: Mark 4: 30-34.
MEMORY VERSE: "So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall
  come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just." Matt. 13: 49.
LESSON HELP: "Christ's Object Lessons," pp. 76-79, 95-134.

                      SETTING OF THE LESSON
   Apparently the parables of this lesson were spoken by Jesus
immediately after the parables of the sower and of the wheat
and the tares. The parable of the mustard seed and that of the
leaven seem to have been given to the multitude who had gath-
ered by the shore of Galilee. Later the multitude was sent away,
and Jesus entered into a house. He there explained the parable
of the tares, and spoke the three other parables of the hidden
treasure, the pearl of great price, and the fisherman's net.
                    Suggestions for Daily Family Study

                                    (3 ]
 3. What lessons may we learn from this parable? Note 2.
4. In still another parable, to what did Jesus liken the kingdom
    of heaven? Verse 33.
5. What lesson is illustrated by this parable? Note 3.
6. What effective means of instruction did Jesus freely use as
    He taught the people? What scripture was He fulfilling by
    this method of instruction? Verses 34, 35. Note 4.
7. By what parable does Jesus show how some appreciate the
    value of salvation? How much was the finder willing to give
    to own the treasure he had found? Verse 44.
8. By what other parable does Jesus show the exceeding value
    of God's grace and salvation, and the importance of seeking
    for it? Verses 45, 46.
 g. What familiar object did Jesus use to teach the relationship
    of the good and the evil to the kingdom of heaven? How

10. When the net was drawn to the shore, what disposition was
    made of its contents? Verse 48.
11. To what particular event does the sorting of the fish refer?
    Verses 49, 50.
12. What question did Jesus ask His disciples after speaking these
    parables? What was their reply? Verse 51.
13. By what comparison did Jesus illustrate the work of the
    Christian disciple? Verse 52. Note 5.
                             NOTES
    I. It was proverbial among the Jews to employ the mustard
seed to denote anything very small, as Jesus did in this parable,
and in Matt. 17: zo and Luke i7: 6. The common mustard of
Palestine grows wild, attaining the height of a horse and rider,
as travelers have noticed.
   2. From the parable of the mustard seed, we may learn several
lessons : that no matter how small a part of the Word may be
received (by word of mouth, a tract, or otherwise), it has in itself
power to work a great transformation in the life; that the working
of the Spirit on a man's heart may not be disconcernible to
others at first, even when he is sensible of it himself. We must
sow in faith, and God will give the increase.
    We may learn also that the mighty works of God often
begin by the smallest means, that the glory may all be His.
Creation was accomplished by a word. The world's Redeemer
was cradled in a manger. The mighty preacher of Pentecost
was the humble fisherman of Galilee. The Reformation of the
sixteenth century began in the heart of a poor monk prostrated
upon the floor of his stone cell, seeking deliverance from his
sins. The work of the third angel's message began in the
home of a humble farmer in New England. What a lesson
                               [4]
for us all ! We need not make beginnings in God's work, it
seems, by large and expensive plans to make an impression upon
the world.` The small beginning and the mighty growth develop
the most sturdy. tree. And what encouragement also this parable
affords to the many faithful children of God who can do only
little things for the Master!
    "Not only is the growth of Christ's kingdom illustrated by
the parable of the mustard seed, but in every stage of its growth
the experience represented in the parable is repeated. For His
churcb:in every generation God'has a special truth and a special
work. . . . And in this last generation the parable of the .mus-
tard seed is to reach a signal and triumphant fulfillment. The
little seed will become a tree. The last message of warning and
mercy is to go to `every nation and kindred and tongue,' 'to take
out of them a people for His name.'. And the earth shall be
lightened with His glory."—'-"Christ's Object Lessons," pp. 78; 79.
    3. The lesson of the mustard seed is here repeated in a dif-
ferent form. The farmer may think upon the power of God's
word, as he sows the little seed, to come forth later as a tender
plant which, under his care and God's blessing, bears a hundred-
fold. The housekeeper may meditate upon the silent working
of the Spirit upon the indifferent heart, as she mixes the leaven
in her flour, and waits patiently for the rising of the dough till
she .can bake her bread and distribute it to the needy.
    4. "Parable-teaching was popular, and commanded the respect
and attention, not only of the Jews, but of the people of other
nations. No more effective method of instruction could He
[Jesus] have employed. If His hearers had desired a knowledge
of divine things, they might have understood His words; for
He was always willing to explain them to the honest inquirer.
    "Again, Christ had truths to present which the people were
unprepared to accept, or even to understand. For this reason
also He taught them in parables. By connecting His teaching
with the scenes of life, experience, or nature, He secured their
attehtion and impressed their hearts. Afterward, as they looked
upon the objects that illustrated His lessons, they recalled the
words of the divine Teacher."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 2T.
    5. "The treasure gained by the householder he does not hoard.
He brings it forth to communicate to others. And by use the
treasure increases. The householder has precious things both
new and old. So Christ teaches that the truth committed to
His disciples is to be communicated to the world. And as the
knowledge of truth is imparted, it will increase."—Id.; P. l2.


    "Let the Sabbath school lesson be learned, not by a hasty glance
at the lesson scripture on, Sabbath morning, but by careful study
for the next Week On 'Sabbath afternoon, with daily review or
illustration during the week."—"Education," pp. 251, 252. •

    "All day He [Jesus] had been teaching and healing; and as
evening came on, the crowds still pressed upon Him. Day after
day He had ministered to them, scarcely pausing for food or rest.
The malicious criticism and misrepresentation with which the
Pharisees constantly pursued Him, made His labors much More
severe and harassing ; and now the close of the day found Him so
utterly wearied that He determined to seek retirement in some
solitary place across the lake.'!—"The Desire of Ages," p. 333.

perfect peace. There was no trace of fear in word or look, for
no fear was in His heart. But He rested not in the possession of
almighty power. It was not as the 'Master of earth and sea
and sky' that He reposed in quiet. That power He had laid down,
and He says, 'I can of Mine. own self do nothing.' He trusted
in the Father's might. It was in faith-faith in God's love
and care-that Jesus rested, and the power of that word which
stilled the storm was the power of God. . .
    "Sin has destroyed our peace. While self is unsubdued, we
can find no rest. The masterful passions of .the heart no human
power can control. We are as helpless here as were the disciples
to quiet, the raging storm. But He who spoke peace to the billoWs
of Galilee, has spoken the word of peace for every soul. However
                              I7]
fierce the tempest, those who turn , to Jesus with the cry, 'Lord,
save: us,'.•will • find deliverance. His grace, that reconciles the
soul to God, quiets the strife of human passion, and in His
love the heart is at rest."—"The Desire of Ages,",pp. 335-337.
    2. The account in Mark, like the ..one in Luke, mentions only
one man possessed with devils; but in Matthew, it is stated that
there were two men. One of them was doubtless more con-
spicuous than the other, and special attention is directed to him
by Mark and Luke, who give more of the details than does
Matthew.
    3. In this lesson, we have' an example of Christ's mastery
over. the powers of darkness. Satan, the chief of devils, is
Apollyon, the destroyer. Rev. 9: it. Christ is "the Prince of
Peace." Isa. 9: 6. The devils, true to their nature, were tor-
menting the poor man—driving him to and fro like the waves
of the sea driven by the winds. Christ, true to His nature, spoke
peace, 'and the 'troubled soul had rest. What a perfect parallel
this miracle was to the stilling of the tempest! Let this word ever
be the joy of the tempted one: Christ is more 'powerful than
Satan, for He has "spoiled principalities and poWers.", "These
things I have spoken unto you, that in Me ye might have peace.
In..the. world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer;
I have overcome the world." John 16: 33.
    4. "With authority He bade the unclean spirits come out of
them. His words penetrated the darkened minds of the unfor-
tunate men. They realized dimly that One was near who could
save them from the tormenting demons. They fell at the Sav-
iour's feet to worship Him ; but when their lips were opened to
entreat His mercy, the demons spoke through them, crying
vehemently, 'What have I to do with Thee, Jesus. Thou Son of
God most high? I beseech Thee, torment me not.' Jesus asked.
'What is thy name?' And the answer was, 'My name is Legion ;
for we are many.' Using the afflicted men as mediums of com-
munication, they besought Jesus not to send them out of the
country."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 338.
    5. "The demons were permitted to sweep a herd of swine into
the sea • and to the dwellers of Gadara the loss. of these out-
weighed the blessings which Christ had bestowed, and the divine
Healer was entreated to depart. This was the result which
Satan designed to secure. By casting the blame of their loss
upon Jesus, he aroused the selfish fears of the people, and
prevented them from listening to His words. .             . But the
purPoses.of Christ were not thwarted. He allowed :the evil spirits
to,destroy the herd of swine as a rebuke to those Jews who were
raising these unclean beasts for the sake of gain. '=•--"The Great
Controversy," p. 515.
t:..6.:The man out of whom the devils were cast wanted to be
with-Jesus. That was a most natural desire; but Jesus said to
him,'MReturti to thine own house, and show 'how great things
Gody.hdth done unto thee." • God saves men for *service. "Ye
                              [8
are an elect race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for
God's own possession, that ye may show forth the excellencies of
Him who called you outs of darkness into His marvelotts light."
I Peter 2 : 9, Revised Version. But, although the Lord sends: us
out to service, instead of allowing us now to dwell in His personal
presence, beholding His face, yet He does not leave us alone, for
He says, "Lo, I am with you alway." Matt. 28: 20.

publicans at the feast. Here Jairus, the ruler of the synageigue,
found Him."—"The Desire of Ages," P. 342.                    •
   The afflicted woman had been pronounced incurable. "Her-
hopes revived when she heard of the cures that. Christ performed.
She felt assured that if she could only go 10. Him, she would be
healed. In weakness and suffering she came to the seaside where
He was teaching, and tried to press through the croWd, but in
vain. Again she- followed Him from the house of Levi-MattheW,
but was still unable to reach Him. She had begun to despair,
when, in making His way through the multitude,'He came'near
where she was."—Id., P. 343.

chief of the priests. In provincial synagogues the `ruler'. was
supreme. No one was eligible to this office until he had a
certificate from the great Sanhedrin that he possessed the requisite
qualifications. His election, however,. was by the members of the
synagogue. It was his duty to supervise all matters connected
with worship."—"Bible Manners, and. Customs."
    2. The Touch of Faith. The disciples could not understand
the difference. between the selfish and. curious crowding of the
multitude and the tduch of faith; but' Jesus could underStand.
It was not the mere touch that healed;-neither was it the garments
of Christ; it was the power of Christ in response to the faith of
the woman. Faith has been defined as "the soul's grasp of Christ's
power to save," and here was its manifestation. The woman
saw by faith the healing already accomplished; she approPriated
the 'boon desired by manifesting her faith. There is as great
difference between the prayer of faith and the fOrmal prayer
as. between the touch of faith and the casual touch. The prayer
of true faith lays hold of the power of God even as the touch of
faith brought virtue from Christ.
    3. What was it that went from Christ to the afflicted woman?
It was just the thing that she stood in need of, and that was life.
As soon as she touched Jesus; she was made whole. 'Life 'from
Jesus-had follOWed that touch of faith, and filled her, ThiS also
was written "that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the
Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through His
name." John 2o: 31. Christ "is our life." Col. 3: 4. He came
to give life—not simply physical life, but spiritual life.
    4. "When the suffering woman put forth her hand to touch
 Him, believing that she would be made.whole, she felt the healing
 virtue. So in spiritual things. To talk. of religion in a casual
 way, to pray without soul-hunger and living faith, avails nothing.
 A nominal faith in Christ, which accepts Him merely as the
 Saviour of the world, can never bring healing to the soul.. The
 faith that is unto salvation is not a mere intelleetual assent to
 the truth: He who waits for entire knowledge before he will
 exercise. faith,. can not receive blessing from God. It is not
 enough to believe about Christ.; we must believe in. Him. The
 only faith that will benefit us is that which embrace Him as a
 personal Saviour; which appropriates His merits to ourselves.
 Many hold faith as an opinion. Saving faith is a transaction, by
 which those who receive Christ, join themselves in covenant
 relation with God. Genuine faith is life. A living faith means
 an increase of vigor, a confiding trust, by which the soul becomes
 a conquering power."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 347. •

     5. Noisy demonstrations of grief at the death of a friend
are common in. Eastern countries. As soon as a person dies,
all the women "in the family set up a loud and doleful cry.
They continue it as long as they can without taking breath, and
the shriek of wailing dies away in a low sob. Nor do the relatives
satisfy themselves with these expressions of violent grief. They
hire persons of both sexes, whose employment it is to mourn
for the dead in like frantic manner. (See Amos 5: 16; Jer.
9 : 20. )"—Barnes.
    "Even the poorest were obliged to provide for a funeral two
flute players and one wailing woman."—Cambridge Bible.

              SPIRIT CAST OUT
                 July 25, 1925

PLACE: Probably in Galilee.
PERSONS: Jesus and the twelve; two blind men; a dumb man; the
  Pharisees and the multitude.

                      SETTING OF THE LESSON
    Blind men and other unfortunates in those days frequented
the highways in Palestine, begging of the passer-by. The afflicted
men in the lesson were probably of this class. A modern writer
says, "Blindness is common in Palestine to a degree which we
in Western lands can scarcely realize."

13. For what did He jell them to pray? Verse 38. Mote
                             NOTES
    t. There are several instances in the four Gospels where the,
phrase "son of David" is used in referring to Jesus. The JeWS
commonly believed, according to the Scriptures, that the MeSsiah
would- be the son of David (John 7: 42) ; but they were greatly
offended at having such language applied to Jesus, and for this
reason tried'      stop it. (See Matt. 20 : 30, 31.) Those who
made use of the term were convinced that He was the son of
David and therefore the Messiah. Their very cry for help
acknowledged Him as the Christ.
   2. Had Jesus at this early period fully manifested Himself
as the Messiah, the people might have tried to make Him : king,
as they, thought to do near the close of His ministry. Such
an attempt would have increased the hatred of the Jewish rulers
and aroused the suspicions of the Roman government ; and
thereby serious obstacles would have been raised, which, humanly
speaking, would have greatly hindered the work Christ came to do:
    "Had: the: priests known the facts concerning the, healing
of the leper,• their hatred of Christ might have led them to remit
a dishonest:sentence. Jesus desired the man to present himself
at the temple before any rumors concerning the miracle had
reached them: Thus an impartial decision could be secured,; and
the restored .leper would be permitted to unite once more with
his family and friends:
                                133
   • There' were other objects which Christ had • in view in
enjoining silence on the man: The Saviour knew. that His enemies
were ever seeking to limit His work, and to turn the people from
Him. He knew that if the healing of the leper were noised
abroad, other sufferers from 'this terrible .disease would crowd
about Him, and the cry would be raised that the 'people would
be contaminated by contact :with them. Many of the. lepers would
not so use the gift of health as,to make it a. blessing to themselves
or <to others. And by drawing the lepers about. Him; He would
give occasion for the charge that He Was breaking down . the
restrictions of the ritual law. Thus His' work in .preaching the
gOsikel would be hindered."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 264.
    3. In commenting on Matt. 12: 22-30, which records an instance
similar to the one in this lesson, the author of "The Desire of
Ages" says, on pages 321 and 322:
    "It was just before this that Jesus had a second time per-
formed the miracle of healing a man possessed, blind and. dumb,
and the Pharisees had reiterated the charge, 'He .casteth out
devils • through the prince of the devils.' . Christ...told them.
plainly that in 'attributing the work of the Holy, Spirit to Satan,
they. were cutting themselves off from the fOuntain of blessing.
Those who had spoken against Jesus Himself„ not discerning
His divine character, might receive forgiveness; for through the
Holy Spirit they might be brought to see their error and 'repent.
Whatever the sin, if the soul repents and believes,.the guilt is
washed away in the blood of Christ; but he who rejects the work
of the Holy Spirit is placing himself where repentance and faith
can not come to him. It is by the Spirit that God works upon the
heart; when men willfully reject the Spirit, and declare it to be
from Satan, they cut off the channel by which God can communi-
cate with them. When the Spirit is finally rejected, there is no
more that God can do for the soul."
  . 4. "During His ministry, Jesus devoted more time to healing
the sick than to preaching. His miracles testified to the truth
of His words, that He came not to destroy but to save. His
righteousness went before Him, and the glory of the Lord
was'His rearward. Wherever He went, the tidings- of His mercy
preceded Him. Where He had passed, the objects of His com-
passion were rejoicing in health, and making trial sof , their new-
found powers. Crowds were collecting around them to hear
from their' lips the works that the Lord had wrought. His voice
was the first sound that many had ever heard, His name the
first word they had ever spoken, His face the first they had ever
looked' upon. Why should they not love Jesus,' and sound His
praise? As He passed through the towns and cities,- He was
like a vital current, diffusing life and joy wherever He went."—
"The Desire of Ages," p. 35o.
    5. "Jesus had now been among the people long enough to see
their wretched condition spiritually, to detect their misdirected
yearnings, and their dissatisfaction with the religious instruction
                               [ 14 ]
  they 'Were te:ceiving, and also :to discover the entire un'titncss
  of their teachers for the work of instructing and saving them.
  They were like sheep, incapable• of caring for themselves, but
  capable of being turned and led into right ways. But who' should
  do all this? An extensive harvest waited to be garnered, but
  who shall do the work? Very few were able and ready to engage
  in it. The. LPrd of the harvest alone could raise up and Send
  forth the needed laborerS."—Dr. Adam Clarke.
     6. Now, as then, many of the people are without a shepherd.
  and the. close of probation is drawing near. The harvest of the
  earth is nearly ripe, and is soon to be gathered. In a special sense
  should .the people of the Lord earnestly pray at this time, that
  the Lord 'of the harvest will raise up laborers, and send them
  forth intp the field to give the last call of salvation.

 weeks of Daniel 9: 24 had not expired; almost seven years still
 remained, allotted to a special work for Daniel's. people "according

 the gentiles orthe Samaritans, they would have lost their influence
 with the Jews. By exciting the prejudice of the Pharisees
 they would have involved themselves in controversy which would
 have discouraged them at the outset of their labors. Even the
 apostles' were 'slow to understand that the gospel was to be
 carried to all nations. Until they themselves could grasp. this
  truth, they were not prepared to labor for the gentiles. If the
 Jews would receive the gospel, God purposed to make them His
 messengers to the gentiles. Therefore they were first to hear the

       "Peace, among the Hebrews, had a very extensive meaning—

                               NOTES
          Eastern countries, the housetops are usually flat. When
a death occurs in a dwelling, the mourners, mostly hired for that
purpose, go to the housetops, where they attract attention by
their loud wailing and lamentation. From the 'housetops, decrees
and proclamations of civil authorities are .made. These procla-
mations are generally made in the evening, when the streets are
full after the people have returned from their lab-ors in the field.
The.publie crier ascends to the highest roof, and lifts up his voice
in a long-drawn call upon all faithful subjects to give ear and
obey. He then proceeds to announce the will of their master
and demands obedience. The call to divine worship is often made
from the housetop in the absence of a tower or bell. Jesus taught
His disciples that they were to go to the multitudes, and there
proclaim the truth with courage and power.
    2. "The servant is not above his master. The Prince of heaven
was called Beelzebub, and His disciples will be misrepresented
in like manner. But whatever the danger, Christ's followers
must avow their principles. They should scorn Concealment.
They can not remain uncommitted until assured of safety in con-
fessing the truth. They are set as watchmen,. to warn men of
their peril. The truth received from Christ must be imparted to
all, freely and openly. Jesus said, 'What I tell you in dAkness,
that speak ye in light; and what ye hear in the ear, that preach
ye upon the housetops.' Jesus Himself never purchased peace by
compromise."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 355.
    3. "The confession of Christ by the apostles was before the
heads of their religion, the chief priests who had crucified Him.
It was before rulers and kings, before the philosophers of Athens.
the libertines of Corinth. It was the bold, unflinching avowal
that the world was saved by the cruel and disgraceful death of
ajew, one of a nation regarded with pretty much the same con-
tempt as they are now. They who Made this conf       ession always
made it at the risk of their lives. . . A ChriStian has now to
profess the creative power of God among evolutionists, and the all-
ruling providence of God in the company of unbelieving scientists.
In some companies, he has to brave the ridicule, attaching to the
belief in miracles. In the society of filthy-minded men, he has
to: uphold the purity of Christ; and in the society of worldlings.
he may be called upon to uphold the rooted antagonism between
the world and Christ. These may seem very poor:and mild ways
of confessing Christ, compared with what our forefathers in
the faith had to endure; but they all try the mettle of the Christian.
If.he.is..faithful in confessing Christ in, these comparatively little
matters, he may have good hope that GOd would, if, called upon,
give,,him.grace to make a bolder and more public' and dangerous
confession if it was laid upon him-so to do. 'Snell is the confession
of Christ; and the reward answers to it."—M. F. Sadler.
                               [ 20 )
    4. There- are different v‘aj;;;- of denying ChriSt "Men may
deny Christ hy evil-speaking, by foolish talking; by words that
are untruthful or unkind. They may deny Him by shunning
life's burdens; by the pursuit. of sinful pleasure.: They may deny
Him by conforming to the World, by uncourteous behavior, by
the love of their own opinions, by justifying self, by cherishing
doubt, borrowing trouble, and dwelling in darkness. In all these
ways they declare that Christ is not in them."—"The Desire of
Ages," p. 357.
    5. The prophet names Jesus "the Prince of Peace." Isa. g: 6.
At His birth, an angelic- host sang, "Glory to God in the highest,
and on earth peace, good will toward men." Luke 2: 13, 14. How,
then, are we to account for these words in verse? 34, 35? The
spirit of - Christ is not at war with men, but with principles. Light
and darkness will not blend. Oil and water will not mix. Jesus
came to deliver man from the bondage of sin. To those who
receive Him, He brings peace. In the hearts of those who reject
Him there is war. While ,Christ came to give peace 'to all, His
coming challenges the powers -of darkness in the hearts of men.
Thus it is saidthat the gospel divides families, -and rends asunder
the strongest ties of nature; but in reality, it is sin that brings
division when some members .of a ,family refuse to yield to
righteousness.

                   SETTING OF THE LESSON
   The twelve had returned from their first. missionary trip.
They "came to Jesus and told Him all things. Their intimate
relationship with Him encouraged them to lay before Him their
favorable and unfavorable experiences, their joy at seeing results
from their labors, and their sorrow at their failures, their faults,
and their weaknesses. They had committed errors in their first
Work as evangelists, and as they frankly told Christ of their expe-
                               L 21 ]
riences, He saw that they needed much instruction. He saw, too,
that they had become weary in their labors, and that they needed
to rest."---':`The..Desire of Ages,". p. 359,•
            • "Vield thy poor best, and ask not how or why, '
                   Lest one day, seeing all about thee spread
                   A mighty: crowd and marvelously fed,
                 Thy heart break out into a bitter cry :

     do as1 soon as they recognized Jesus? What blessing did
     Jesus bring to the people of this whole region? Matt. 14:
     34-36; Mark 6 : 36.
                             NOTES
    7. "In a life wholly devoted to the good of others, the Saviour
 found it necessary to withdraw from the thoroughfares of travel
and from the throng that followed Him day after day. -He must
turn aside from a life of ceaseless activity and contact with human
needs, to seek retirement and unbroken communion with His
Father. As one with us, a sharer in our needs and weaknesses,
 He was wholly dependent upon God, and in the secret place of
 prayer He sought divine strength, that He might go forth braced
 for duty and trial. In a world of sin, Jesus endured struggles
and torture of soul. In communion with God He could unburden
 the sorrows that were crushing Him. Here He found comfort
 and joy."—"The Desire of Ages," pp. 362, 363.
    2. The "desert place" to which Jesus and His disciples retired
 seeking rest was not a barren, desolate region. John says there
 was much grass there (John 6: To), and Mark says that the
 grass was green (Mark 6: 39). It was no doubt a quiet, sparsely
 populated region.
    3. Jesus was able to feed the multitude with the little food at
 hand. We may learn a lesson from this. Our talents may be
 few, but if:we bring them to Jesus, He can use them to feed
 hungry souls who are perishing for the bread of life.         •
    4. "He who had all the resources of infinite power at His
 command said, `Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing
 be lost.' These words meant more than putting the bread into
 the baskets. The lesson was twofold. Nothing is to be wasted.
 We are to let slip no temporal advantage. - We should neglect
 nothing that will tend to benefit a human being. Let everything
 be gathered up that will relieve the necessity of earth's' hungry
                              [231
  ones. And'iliere Sh'mild be the same carefulness in spiritual
                    the baskets of fragments were collected, the people
  tliOught of 'their friends at home. They wanted them to share in
  the bread ;that "Christ had blessed. The contents of the baskets
  Were 'diAributed among the eager throng, and -were, carried
  away into all the region round about. So those who were at the
   feast were to give to others the bread that comes down from
  heaven, to satisfy the hunger of theisoul. They were to repeat
  what they had learned of the wonderful things•of God. Nothing
  was,to be lost. Not one word that concerned their eternal salvia:
  tion was to fall useless to the ground."—"The Desire of Ages;"
   p. 368.
         "The:Jews had often suffered by famine in those times in
  Which their enemies were permitted to prevail over them; but,
  finding that Jesus had such power as to multiply a few loaves
  to feed thousands; they took it for granted that while He was
      their.,heacl,, no. evil could possibly happen to them, and there-
   fore were determined immediately to proclaim Him king."—Dr.
  Adam Clarke.
      6. "Calling His disciples, Jesus bids them take the boat, and
  return at once to Capernaum, leaving Him to dismiss the people.
      '"Never before had a command from Christ seemed so im-
  possible' of fulfillment. The disciples had long hoped for a
  popuiai Anovdment 'to place Jesus on the throne; they could not
  endure ''iffe—ihought that all this enthusiasm .should come to
  itothing The multitudes that were assembling to keep the Pass-
 .OVer Were anxious to see the new prophet. To His followers
:;'this seemed the golden opportunity to establish ,their beloved
 'Master On-the throne of Israel. In the glow of this new ambition
 'it was hard for them to go away by themselves, and leave Jesus
 'alone upon that' desolate shore. They protested against the
 •arratigenient; but Jesus now spoke with an authority He had never
  before assumed toward thein. They knew that further opposition
 'on their i:i'art Would be useless, and in silence they turned toward
  the sea,
     •"Jesns now commands the multitude to disperse; and His
  manner is sd'decisive that they dare not disobey. The words of
  praise and, exaltation die on their lips. In the very act of ad-
 'vancing to Seize Him, their steps are stayed, and the glad, eager
  look 'fades from their countenances."—"The Desire .;of Ages,"
  I,- 378. "'
      7. P6rriter1y'the Jews had but three watches of the night,
  enumerated as the first, or "beginning of the watches" (Lam.
:2 : i9);                  watch" (Judges 7: 19), and "the morning
'watch" •(:Pt. - 14: 24; ' I Sam. it : it). These were respectively
  froin'§tifOetto         m., from to p. m. to 2 a. m., and from 2 a. in.
"to ;Stunait&"'At this -time, however, they had mostly given up
  theif OWt1,thinplitatiOn of the night watches, and adopted that of

known as even, midnight, cockcrowing, and morning. Mark 13.:
35. The "fourth" watch must, therefore, -have been between
 three and six .o'clock in the morning.
    We may learn lessons from this experience in .the 'last w!atch
of the night. It was in the last watch of the night, the morning
watch, that God delivered Israel of old from :their ..Egyptian
foes. Ex. 14: 24-31. Out of that came their glorious triumph,
and the song of the triumph, the song of Moses. This, parable
deals with the last watch of the night, the morning watch ...:and-v>e

                              NOTES •
   1. "They had already seen the miracle of the five loaves, and
did not believe; and it was'impossible for them to see anything
mote descriptive of unlimited power and goodness. Even mira-,
cles themselves are lost on persons whose hearts.are,fi*ed on the
perishing things of the •world, and whose minds are filled with
prejudice against the truth. Their argument seemed to run
thus .: Thou Bast, we grant, fed five thousand men with five
loaves and two small fishes; but what is this in comparison with
what Moses did in the desert, who for forty years fed more
than a million persons .with bread from heaven? Do something
like this, and then we will believe on Thee, as we have believed
on Moses."—Dr. Adam Clarke.
    2. "To eat the flesh- and drink the blood of Christ is to receive
Him as a personal Saviour, believing that He forgives our sins,
and that we are complete in Him. It is by beholding His love,
by dwelling upon it, by drinking it in, that we are to become
                               t 27I
partakers of His nature. What food is to the body, Christ must
be to the soul. Food can not benefit us unless we eat it ; finless
it becomes a part of our being. So Christ is of no value to us
if we do not know Him as a personal Saviour, A theoretical
knowledge wilt do us. no good. We must feed upon Him, receive
Him into the heart, so that His life becomes our life. His love,
His grace, must be assimilated."---- Thi, Desire of, Ages," p. 389.
    3: Among those .who followed Jesus were many who had only
selfish ends to gratify. They were willing to share in all the
blessings and privileges about which He taught, but were not
willing to comply with the provisions and conditions upon which
these blessings were to be obtained. Jesus taught of spiritual,
eternal things. They thought only of carnal, material things.
When they began to understand that a change of heart and life
in themselves was necessary in order to be true disciples of the
Master, they questioned His teachings, and many of them followed
Him no more.
    4. "By the public rebuke of their unbelief these disciples
were still further alienated from Jesus. They were greatly dis-
pleased, and wishing to wound the Saviour, and gratify the malice
of the Pharisees, they turned their backs upon Him, and left
Him with disdain.. They had made their choice,—had taken
the form without the spirit, the husk without the kernel.. Their
decision was never afterward reversed ; for they walked no more
with. Jesus."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 392.
    5. "Are you a follower of Christ? Then all that is written
concerning the spiritual life is written for you, and may be attained
through uniting yourself to Jesus. Is your zeal languishing?
has your first love grown cold? Accept again of the proffered
love of Christ. Eat of His fleih,- drink of His blood, and you
will become one with the Father and with the Son. . . .
    "As our physical life is sustained by food, so our spiritual
life is sustained by the Word of God. And every soul is to
receive life from God's Word for himself. As we must eat for
ourselves in order to receive nourishment, so we must receive the
Word for ourselves. We are not to obtain it merely through the
medium of anther's, mind.. We should carefully study.. the Bible,
asking God for the aid of the Holy Spirit, that we may understand
His Word."-74d.,       389, 390.

                   SETTING OF THE LESSON
   "Jesus withdrew from Capernaum, and crossing Galilee, re-
paired to the hill country on the borders of Phoenicia.. . . In
coming to this region He hoped to find the retirement He - had
failed to secure at Bethsaida. Yet this was not His only' purPose
in taking this journey. . . . The people of this district were of
the old Canaanite race. They were idolaters, and were despised
and hated by the Jews. To this class belonged the woman 'who
now came to Jesus. She was a heathen, and was therefore ex-
cluded from the advantages which the Jews daily enjoyed... .
This woman had heard of the prophet, who, it was reported,
healed all manner of diseases. As she heard of His power, hope
sprung up in her heart. Inspired by a mother's love, she de-
termined to present her daughter's case to Him. It was her
resolute purpose to bring her affliction to Jesus. He must heal
her child. She had sought help from the heathen gods,- but had
obtained no relief."—"The Desire of Ages," pp. 399,.400.-
                                "Her eyes
           Flashed with quick wit of anguish ; and she cried:
          'Truth, Lord ! but crumbs fall, and the dogs may -eat •
           The children's leavings !' Then beamed forth anew
           That high look on His face, which comforted." '.

      In the time of our Saviour, the Jews had erected a high
      I.
dividing wall between themselves and all people of other nations,
or gentiles, regardless of the country from which they came.
To be outside of the Jewish nation was to be regarded by them
as 'separated from salvation and from God, and all such were
held in contempt. In i Corinthians 4: 10-13, Paul gives a picture
of how 'those outside of the Jewish nation were regarded by
the Jews.

not be - at a loss how to act in similar cases 'after Jesus' should
leave them and they. could no ,longer go to Him for personal
counsel. Jesus designed that they should be impressed with
the contrast between the cold and heartless manner in which the
Jews would treat such a case, as evinced by His reception.of the
woman, and the compassionate manner in which He would have
them deal with such distress, as manifested by ,His subsequent'

PLACE: A mountain desert place in the region of Decapolis, near Gergesa,
  where the demoniacs were healed; thence across the lake to Dalmanutha,
  near Magdala, in Galilee.
PERSONS: Jesus and the disciples; a multitude of four thousand men,
  besides women and children; a blind man; Pharisees.

                     SETTING OF THE LESSON
   Jesus and His disciples were now in that part of the country
where the demoAacs of Gergesa had been healed. Once these
people had begged Him to depart from their coasts. Now a desire
was aroused to see Him, and a crowd gathered to : greet Him.
The change of sentiment was no doubt due in large measure to
the testimony of the two men who had been restored to their
right minds. Jesus had said to them, "Go home to thy friends.
and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee."
The gathering of the four thousand to listen to the words of the
great Healer was evidence of the faithfulness of these two men.

the five thousand. But they did not. "Again the disciples revealed
their unbelief. At Bethsaida they had seen how, with Christ's
blessing, their little store availed for the feeding of the multitude;
yet they did not now bring forward their all, trusting His power
to multiply it for the hungry crowds. Moreover, those whom He
fed at'Bethsaida ,were Jews; these were gentiles and heathen.
Jewish ptejudice was still strong in the hearts of the disciples.
and they answered Jesus, 'Whence can a man satisfy these men
with bread here in the wilderness?' "—"The Desire of Ages,"

again meets the cold unbelief of the scribes and Pharisee., in
marked contrast to His welcome among the heathen people.about
Gadara and in the coasts of Tyre and Sidon. He remained, only
a short time in this place.
    3. Jesus no doubt was grieved at this time that He did not
see in the hearts of His disciples greater. evidence That they truly
grasped His divine mission. The shadows of the cross- were
beginning to fall upon His pathway. His disciples had witnessed
many of His mighty works, and their interpretation of what He
had said about the leaven of the Pharisees was evidence that they
but faintly comprehended Him who was daily in their presence.
They failed to grasp and hold the truth that they had with them
the Creator of all things—Him who had only to "speak" and it
"stood fast." Jesus apparently from this time on sought es-
pecially to impress the disciples with His divine Mission, thus
preparing them for the dark scenes of His trial and crucifixion
which were just before Him at Jerusalem.
    4. Jesus approached the question of His divine Sonship with
great caution. He knew that upon this question hung the destiny
of the world; that around this truth the storm of the ages
was already gathering, and would soon burst in relentless -fury.
Satan had assailed the truth of the incarnation, in the wilderness
of temptation, with, "-If Thou be, the Son of God." Jesus knew
His foe, and the strength of the temptation awaiting the disciples
upon this point. He desired to prepare them for it while He
was still with them.
   "From the first, Peter had believed Jesus to be the Messiah.
Many others . . . now doubted that Jesus was the Messiah,
for whom they had looked so long. Many of the disciples who
had ardently expected Jesus to take His place on David's throne,
left Him when they perceived that He had no such intention...
On this day, before they were brought face to face with the
great trial of their faith, the Holy Spirit rested upon them in
power. For a little time their eyes were turned away from 'the
things which are seen,' to behold 'the things which are not seen.'
Beneath the guise of humanity they discerned the .glory of the
Son of God."—"The Desire of Ages," pp -4n; 412. •
    5. "Satan was trying to discourage JesuS;.and turn Him from
His mission; and Peter, in his blind love, was giving voice to the
temptation. The prince of evil was -the -author o.f the thought.
His instigation was behind that impulsiVe appeal. . . . The words
of Christ were spoken, not to Peter, but to the one who was
trying to separate him from his Redeemer."-4d., p. 416.

useless and pernicious indulgences, while souls are perishing for
the word of life."—"The Great Controversy,". p. 475.

                     SETTING OF THE LESSON

   "Evening is drawing on as Jesus calls to His side three of His
disciples, Peter, James, and John, and leads them across the
fields, and far up a rugged path, to a lonely mountain side. The
Saviour and His disciples have spent the day in traveling and
teaching, and the mountain climb adds to their weariness. .
The light of the setting sun still lingers on the mountain top,
and gilds with its fading glory the path they are traveling. But
soon the light dies out from hill as well as valley, the sun dis-
appears behind the western horizon, and the solitary .travelers
are wrapped in the darkness of night."—"The Desire of Ages,"

                             NOTES
 ,  1. The statement of Jesus recorded in Matthew 16:28, that
some of those present should not taste of death until they saw
the kingdom of. God come, no doubt referred to the transfigura-
tion. Here was given a representation in miniature of the future
kingdom and home of God's people. Jesus, the -King, was seen
in.His glory; Moses stood as a representative of the resurrected
satins (Jude 9), and Elijah of those who will be translated at the
coming of Christ. t Thess. 4: 16, 17.
    What did Jesus, Elijah, and Moses talk about? "Not the
inauguration of Christ as king, but the decease to be accomplished
at Jerusalem, is the subject of their conference with Jesus.
Bearing the weakness of humanity, and burdened with its sorrow
and, sin, Jesus walked alone in the midst of men. As the darkness
of the coming trial pressed upon Him, He was in loneliness of
spirit, in a world that knew Him not. Even His loved disciples,
Absorbed in their own doubt and sorrow and ambitious hopes, had
not comprehended the mystery of His mission. He had dwelt
amid the love and fellowship of heaven; but in the world that He
had created, He was in solitude. Now heaven had sent its messen-
gers to Jesus; not angels, but men who had endured suffering
and sorrow, and who could sympathize with the Saviour in the'
trial of His earthly life. Moses and Elijah had been colaborers
with Christ. They had shared His longing for the salvation of
men. Moses had pleaded for Israel: 'Yet now, if Thou wilt
forgive their sin ;—and if not, blot me, I pray Thee, out of Thy
hook which Thou hast written.' Elijah had known loneliness
of spirit, as for three years and a half of famine he had borne
the burden of the nation's hatred and its woe. Alone he had
stood for God upon Mount Carmel. Alone he had fled to the
desert in anguish and despair. These men, chosen above every
angel around the throne, had come to commune with Jesus con-
                             [ 36]
cerning the scenes of His suffering, and to comfort Him with the
assurance of the sympathy of heaven. The hope of the world,
the salvation of every human being, was the burden of their
interview."—"The Desire of Ages," pp. 422-425.
    2. Peter, James, and John heard with their own ears the
voice of God when He spoke from the glory of the transfigura-
tion. With their own eyes they saw Jesus, Moses, and Elijah,
and they heard them conversing together. Nothing.could have been
clearer to human senses ; but Peter says, "We have a more sure
word of prophecy." That is to say, while we may place a reason-
able degree of confidence in what our natural senses, like sight,
hearing, and feeling, tell us, still we have something "more sure"
for our senses can be deceived, but the word of prophecy—the
Bible—never fails.

                    SETTING OF THE LESSON
    The entire night has been passed in the mountain of trans-
figuration. "As the sun arose, Jesus and His disciples descended
to the plain. Absorbed in thought, the disciples were awed and
silent. Even Peter had not a word to say. Gladly would they
have lingered in that holy place which had been touched with
the light of heaven, and where the Son of God had manifested
His glory ; but there was work to be done for the people, who
were already searching far and near for Jesus. At the foot of
the mountain a large company had gathered, led hither by the
disciples who had remained behind, but who knew whither Jesus
had resorted."—"The Desire of Ages;' p. 426.

  14. When alone with Jesus, what question did His disciples ask
       Him? Verse 28.
  15. What explanation of their failure to cast out the evil spirit
,      did Jesus make?, Verse 29. Note 3.
                                 NOTES
   1. "Authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, had been
conferred on the disciples when Jesus sent out the twelve to preach
through Galilee. As they went forth strong in faith, the evil
spirits had obeyed their word. Now in the name of Christ they
commanded the torturing spirit to leave his victim; but the demon
only mocked them by a fresh display of his power. The disciples,
unable to account for their defeat, felt that they were bringing
dishonor upon themselves and their Master. And in the crowd
                                 [ 38 ]
there were scribes who made the most of this opportunity to
humiliate them."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 427.
    2. "Again the Prince of Life and the prince of the powers
of darkness had met on the field of battle,—Christ in fulfillment
of His mission to 'preach deliverance to the captives, . . . to set
at liberty them that are bruised,' Satan seeking to hold his victim
under his control. Angels of light and the hosts of evil angels,
unseen, were pressing near to behold the conflict. For a moment,
Jesus permitted the evil spirit to display his power, that the
beholders might comprehend the deliverance about to be wrought.
The multitude looked on with bated breath, the father in an agony
of hope and fear."—Id., p. 428.
    3. "Their unbelief, that shut them out from deeper sympathy
with Christ, and the carelessness with which they regarded the
sacred work committed to them, had caused their failure in the
conflict with the powers of darkness.
    "The words of Christ pointing to His death, had brought
sadness and doubt. And the selection of the three disciples to
accompany Jesus to the mountain had excited the jealousy of the
nine. Instead of strengthening their faith by prayer and medita-
tion on the words of Christ, they had been dwelling on their
discouragements and personal grievances. In this state of, dark-
ness they had undertaken the conflict with Satan.
    "In order to succeed in such a conflict they must come to the
work in a different spirit. Their faith must be strengthened by
fervent prayer and fasting, and humiliation of heart. They must
be emptied of self, and be filled with the Spirit and power of
God. Earnest, persevering supplication to God in faith,—faith
that leads to entire dependence upon God, and unreserved conse-
cration to His work,—can alone avail to bring men the Holy
Spirit's aid in the battle against principalities and powers, the
rulers of the darkness' of this world, and wicked spirits in high
places."—Id., P. 430.
