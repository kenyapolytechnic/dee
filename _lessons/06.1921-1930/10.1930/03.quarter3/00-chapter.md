     SABBATH SCHOOL IN THE CAMEROONS
                          M. RASPAL
        [SUPERINTENDENT OF THE CAMEROON MISSION, AFRICA]
   HE beginning of .the Sabbath school work in the Cameroons was
T  very difficult. It was not easy to gather the natives together, and
especially was it difficult to have a regular attendance. One did not
 dare record the names of those attending a Sabbath school session,
 for they would not return again, thinking that their names had been
 taken to be given to the administrative authorities of the government.
     We are truly thankful to God that conditions have now changed.
 To-day we may enroll the names of the natives as well as mark their
 attendance. Several persons have given their names of their own
 accord, and have made request to be enrolled in the baptismal class.
 We now have more than one hundred natives in this class.
     Since our arrival in the spring of 1929, we have seen the number
 of Sabbath school members increase each quarter. At present we
 have three Sabbath schools,—one here at Nanga-Eboko ; another a
 three days' march from here; and the third a day and half's march
 from here. In these three schools there are two hundred thirty
 members.
     These natives are extremely interested in the Sabbath school
lessons. Several of them can recite all the memory verses for one
quarter by heart. The children are especially interested, and they are
the ones usually who can give the best answers to questions asked
by teachers.
    The work goes slowly, yet there is progress that encourages us
greatly. For example, formerly it was difficult to arrest the attention
of the natives, accustomed as they are to move about at will or to
turn from right to left; but now, almost all fix their gaze upon the
one who is conducting the lesson. The Picture Rolls also aid greatly
in holding their attention.
• When one realizes how uncivilized are the natives of the Cam-
eroons, one can but praise the Lord for His power, which acts upon
their minds to awaken them from their sleep that they may be saved.
    Much has not yet been gathered in the way of gifts, but we believe
that soon our members will experience the blessing of God, and will
understand that it is more blessed to give than to receive. These
people are poor, often not having sufficient to eat or enough for
clothes. Many have only a little girdle of grass to cover their naked-
ness. Some are beginning to work a few hours, however, in order to
earn money. Then they buy a girdle made of cloth, which they wrap
around their loins, and sometimes over the entire body.
    We have great hopes for our Sabbath schools in the Cameroons.
They will be the means of converting hearts to God ; and through
them is the best way in which to instruct the natives in the knowledge
of God. Pray for our schools in the Cameroons, that God will give
full success to this phase of the work. Pray also for the schools the
world over.

                     Lesson 1 July 5, 1930
               The Repentance of Nineveh
LESSON SCRIPTURE: The Book of Jonah.
MEMORY VERSE: Ps. 139:9, 10.
LESSON HELP: "Prophets and Kings," pp. 265-278.
                            INTRODUCTION
   Nineveh was one of the greatest of ancient cities. It was founded
by Nimrod (Gen. 10:9-11, margin), on the eastern bank of the Tigris.
Later kings enlarged and adorned it until it became a great and magnifi-
cent city. Authorities state that it was eighteen miles in length and
eleven in breadth, and that the walls were one hundred feet high, and so
broad that three chariots might be driven abreast upon them.
                               THE LESSON
    1. What commission did the Lord give to Jonah, son of Amittai?
What was the reason for the call? Jonah 1:1, 2.
    NOTE.—"In the time of its temporal prosperity Nineveh was a cen-
ter of crime and wickedness. Inspiration has characterized it as 'the
bloody city, . . . full of lies and robbery.' . . . Yet Nineveh, wicked
though it had become, was not wholly given over to evil. He who 'be-
holdeth all the sons of men,' and ‘seeth every precious thing,' perceived
in that city many who were reaching out after something better and
higher, and who, if granted opportunity to learn of the living God, would
put away their evil deeds, and worship Him. And so in His wisdom God
revealed Himself to them in an unmistakable manner, to lead them, if
possible, to repentance. The instrument chosen for this work was the
prophet Jonah, the son of Amittai."—"Prophets and Kings,"pp. 265,266.
    2. What did God's call to Jonah cause him to do? Where did he go?
Verse 3.
    NOTE.—"In the charge given him, Jonah had been intrusted with a
heavy responsibility; yet He who hab idden him go was able to sustain
His servant and grant Him success. Had the prophet obeyed unques-
tioningly, he would have been spared many bitter experiences, and would
have been blessed abundantly. Yet in the hour of Jonah's despair the
Lord did not desert him. Through a series of trials and strange provi-
dences, the prophet's confidence in God and in His infinite power to save
was to be revived."—Id., pp. 266, 267.
    3. How did the Lord intervene in Jonah's attempted flight from
duty? What lesson can we learn from the attempts of the mariners to
save their lives? Where was Jonah at this time? Verses 4, 5.
   4. What demand did the shipmaster make of Jonah? For what pur-
pose did they cast lots? As the lot fell on Jonah, for what explanation
did they call? Verses 6-8.
   5. Whom did Jonah confess before them? What effect did it have on
the sailors? What did they recognize? Verses 9, 10.
                                  [3I
    NOTE.—Confronted with the consequences of his refusal to obey
God's command, Jonah confessed whose servant he was. He had fled the
responsibility placed upon him by the Creator of "the sea and the dry
land." The sailors, though heathen, recognized Jonah's God as the su-
preme deity. While they did not worship the Creator, they knew of Him.
Among many of the heathen a supreme deity, unkno     wn to them as we
know Him, is recognized as existing and controlling all things. Him they
fear, and often in ignorance and superstition worship afar off.
    6. Seeking for relief, what question was put to Jonah? What was
his suggestion? Verses 11, 12.
    7. What efforts did the sailors put forth to save their lives, at the
same time rejecting the sacrifice of Jonah? What prayer did they offer?
What did they filially recognize was the only way for them to be saved?
Verses 13-16; Acts 4:12.
    8. What preparation had the Lord made to save Jonah? How long
did he remain in the bowels of the fish? Jonah 1:17.
    NoTE.—"The appeal made to the main facts of this history by our
Lord, proves that we are to admit of no allegorical exposition of these
facts. 1. There was such a person as Jonah. 2. He was swallowed by a
sea monster, in whose belly he was miraculously preserved three days and
three nights. 3. This same prophet preached to the Ninevites ; and they
repented, and turned from their sins, under his ministry. This testimony
puts an end to all mythological, allegorical, and hypothetical interpre-
tations of those great facts."—Dr. Adam Clarke.
    9. What acknowledgment of God's justice did Jonah make? For
what did he pray? With what result? Jonah 2.
    NOTE.—"At last Jonah had learned that 'salvation belongeth unto
the Lord.' With penitence and a recognition of the saving grace of God,
came deliverance."—"Prophets and Kings," p. 269.
    10. What command came again to Jonah? What attitude did he now
take? Jonah 3:1-3.
    NOTE.—"Once more the servant of God was commissioned to warn
Nineveh. . . . This time he did not stop to question or doubt, but obeyed
unhesitatingly."—Id., pp. 269, 270.
    11. Having gone a day's journey into Nineveh, what message did
Jonah bear? What was the effect of his words? Verses 4, 5.
    12. To whom did the word of Jonah's preaching come? What did
 the king do? What commands did he give? What was his hope?
Verses 6-9.
    13. Because of Nineveh's repentance,what did the Lord do? Verse 10.
    NoTE.—"As king and nobles, with the common people, the high and
the low, 'repented at the preaching of Jonas,' and united in crying to the
God of heaven, His mercy was granted them. . . . Their doom was
averted; the God of Israel was exalted and honored throughout the
heathen world, and His law was revered. Not until many years later was
                                   1 4]
Nineveh to fall a prey to the surrounding nations through forgetfulness
of God and through boastful pride."—Id.,•pp. 270, 271.
     14. Fearing that he would be regarded as a false prophet, what re-
quest did Jonah make? Jonah 4:1-3.
     NOTE.—"When Jonah learned of God's purpose to spare the city
that, notwithstanding its wickedness, had been led to repent in sack-
cloth and ashes, he should have been the first to rejoice because of God's
amazing grace; but instead he allowed his mind to dwell upon the pos-
sibility of his being regarded as a false prophet. Jealous of his reputa-
tion, he lost sight of the infinitely greater value of the souls in that
wretched city."—Id., p. 271.
     15. What rebuke did the Lord give to Jonah? What did Jonah do?
What did the Lord cause to grow to shelter him? What became of it
next morning? Verses 4-7.
     16. When the sun rose next day, and the east wind blew, how did
Jonah feel? What question did God ask? What was Jonah's hasty
reply? Verses 8, 9.
     17. What lesson did the Lord draw from the incident of the gourd?
Verses 10, 11.
     NOTE.—"Our God is a God of mercy. With long-sufferance and ten-
der compassion He deals with the transgressors of His law. And yet, in
this our day, when men and women have so many opportunities for be-
coming familiar with the divine law as revealed in Holy Writ, the great
Ruler of the universe cannot behold with any satisfaction the wicked
 cities, where reign violence and crime. The end of God's forbearance
with those who persist in disobedience, is approaching rapidly."—Id.,
pp. 275, 276.
     18. What is God's message to the inhabitants of earth to-day? Matt.
24:44.
     NOTE.—"God's message for the inhabitants of earth to-day is, 'Be
 ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.'
 The conditions prevailing in society, and especially in the great cities of
 the nations, proclaim in thunder tones that the hour of God's judgment
 is come, and that the end of all things earthly is at hand. We are stand-
 ing on the threshold of the crisis of the ages. In quick succession the
 judgments of God will follow one another,—fire, and flood, and earth-
 quake, with war and bloodshed. We are not to be surprised at this time
 by events both great and decisive; for the angel of mercy cannot remain
 much longer to shelter the impenitent."—Id., p. 278.
                         MEDITATION TOPICS
    I. Am I happy at the repentance and restoration of sinners to God's
grace and favor?
    2. Is the soul of one individual of more value to me than my repu-
tation'?
    3. How does Psalm 139:1-12 illumine the story of Jonah's experi-
ence'
    4. How was Jonah an antitype of Christ'? Matt. 12:39, 40 ; Luke
11:30.
                     Lesson 2 — July 12, 193 0

Israel Taken Captive Into Assyria; The Impiety
                  of Uzziah
MEMORY VERSE: Prov. 29:1.
LESSON HELP: "Prophets and Kings," pp. 279-305.
                            INTRODUCTION
    "In the terrible judgments brought upon the ten tribes, the Lord
had a wise and merciful purpose. That which He could no longer do
through them in the land of their fathers, He would seek to accomplish
by scattering them among the heathen. His plan for the salvation of all
who should choose to avail themselves of pardon through the Saviour
of the human race, must yet be fulfilled; and in the afflictions brought
upon Israel, He was preparing the way for His glory to be revealed to
the nations of earth. Not all who were carried captive were impenitent.
Among them were some who had remained true to God, and others who
had humbled themselves before Him. Through these, 'the sons of the
living God,' He would bring multitudes in the Assyrian realm to a
knowledge of the attributes of His character and the beneficence of His
law."—"Prophets and Kings," p. 292.
                              THE LESSON
    1. What is said of Hoshea's course in comparison with that of the
 kings who preceded him? To whom did he render tribute? 2 Kings
17:1-3.
    2. As a result of Hoshea's conspiring with the king of Egypt against
Assyria, what was done to him? Verse 4.
    3. What further action did the king of Assyria take? Verses 5, 6.
    4. For what reasons had the Lord allowed the captivity of Israel?
Verses 7-12.
    5. What had the Lord done to turn Israel from these wicked ways?
With what results? Verses 13-15.
    6. How far did Israel carry their rebellion against God? Who only
were left at this time in Canaan? Verses 16-18; Deut. 18:10. -
    NOTE.—"The iniquity in Israel during the last half century before
the Assyrian captivity, was like that of the days of Noah, and of every
other age when men have rejected God and have given themselves wholly
to evildoing. The exaltation of nature above the God of nature, the wor-
ship of the creature instead of the Creator, has always resulted in the
grossest of evils. Thus when the people of Israel, in their worship of
Baal and Ashtoreth, paid supreme homage to the forces of nature, they
severed their connection with all that is uplifting and ennobling, and
fell an easy prey to temptation. With the defenses of the soul broken
down, the misguided worshipers had no barrier against sin, and yielded
themselves to the evil passions of the human heart."—"Prophets and
Kings," pp. 281, 282.
                                    61
    7. Who were sent to take their inheritance in Samaria? What was
the attitude of these heathen worshipers toward Jehovah? When a priest
was sent among them, what mingled worship was developed? 2 Kings
17:24-29, 41.
    NoTE.—"Sargon, after deporting most of the population of Israel
(722 B. C.), sent a colony of non-Israelites to live in the town of Sa-
maria. These intermarried with the few Israelites left, and were joined
by another group in the reign of Esarhaddon (675, Ezra 4:2), or As-
shurbanipal (Asnapper, Osnappar, R. V., Ezra 4:10) in 650 B. C. The
Israelitic element, however, proved the strongest in influence and was
possibly the strongest in number. At all events, the religion of the
mixed race was a modified form of Jehovah worship, though many from
among the non-Israelites reverted to their idolatry (2 Kings 17:29)."—
"New Standard Bible Dictionary," p. 805.
    8. At what age was Uzziah made king over Judah? How did he re-
late himself to God? 2 Chron. 26:1-4.
   9. As a result of his faithfulness, how did the Lord prosper him?
Verses 5-8.
    10. To what extent did Uzziah build up and equip his army? What
was the effect of prosperity upon his character? What act of presump-
tion did he attempt? Verses 13-16.
    11. What did Azariah and the other priests do and say to Uzziah
the king? Verses 17, 18.
   12. While angrily facing the priests with a censer in his hand, what
punishment came to Uzziah? Verse 19.
    NOTE,—"Uzziah was filled with wrath, that he, the king, should be
thus rebuked. But he was not permitted to profane the sanctuary against
the united protest of those in authority. While standing there, in wrath-
ful rebellion, he was suddenly smitten with a divine judgment. Leprosy
appeared on his forehead. In dismay he fled, never again to enter the
temple courts. Unto the day of his death, some years later, Uzziah re-
mained a leper—a living example of the folly of departing from a
plain 'Thus saith the Lord.' "—"Prophets and Kings," p. 304.
   13. As the priests saw him stricken, what did they do? What did
he himself realize? Verse 20.
   NoTE.—"Neither his [Uzziah's] exalted position nor his long life of
service could be pleaded as an excuse for the presumptuous sin by which
he marred the closing years of his reign, and brought upon himself the
judgment of Heaven."—Ibid.
   14. For how long did Uzziah bear the results of his punishment?
Where was he compelled to remain? Who took his place over the king's
house? Verse 21.
   15. In the days of Uzziah, what prophet began his work? Verse 22;
Isa. 1:1.
   NOTE,—"The reign of Uzziah was drawing to a close, and Jotham
was already bearing many of the burdens of state, when Isaiah, of the
                                [7 ]
royal line, was called, while yet a young man, to the prophetic mission.
The times in which Isaiah was to labor were fraught with peculiar peril
to the people of God. . . . The dangers from without, overwhelming
though they seemed, were not so serious as the dangers from within. It
was the perversity of his people that brought to the Lord's servant the
greatest perplexity and the deepest depression. By their• apostasy and
rebellion, those who should have been standing as light bearers among
the nations were inviting the judgments of God."—Id., pp. 305, 306.
                        MEDITATION TOPICS
    I. God reproves, rebukes, and extends His offers of mercy condi-
tional on our repentance.
    2. Are we like Israel continually rejecting His counsels, and even-
tually inviting His wrath?
    3. Which is harder to bear properly, prosperity or adversity? What
are some of the temptations of the prosperous? How may a long and
successful record be spoiled in a few moments of time?


                     Lesson 3 — July 19, 1930

 The Prayer of Hezekiah; The Sundial of Ahaz
MEMORY VERSE: Ps. 46:1.
LESSON HELP: "Prophets and Kings," pp. 329-366.
                            INTRODUCTION
    Hezekiah was the son of Ahaz, king of Judah. Ahaz had followed
an idolatrous course in the latter years of his life, and when Syria and
Ephraim conspired against him, had sought the aid of Assyria, contrary
to the counsel of the prophet of God. "The tribute offered aroused the
cupidity of Assyria, and that treacherous nation soon threatened to
overflow and spoil Judah."
    "As the apostate king [Ahaz] neared the end of his reign, he caused
the doors of the temple to be closed. The sacred services were inter-
rupted. No longer were the candlesticks kept burning before the altar_
No longer were offerings made for the sins of the people. No longer did
sweet incense ascend on high at the time of the morning and the evening
sacrifice. Deserting the courts of the house of God, and locking fast
its doors, the inhabitants of the godless city boldly set up altars for the
worship of heathen deities on the street corners throughout Jerusalem.
Heathenism had seemingly triumphed; the powers of darkness had well-
nigh prevailed."—"Prophets and Kings," p. 330.
                           THE LESSON
   1. Who succeeded Ahaz as king of Judah? What was the relation-
ship of Hezeldah to God during his reign? 2 Kings 18:1-3.
    2. How did he demonstrate his loyalty to God? How did the Lord
reward him? Verses 4-8.
   NomE.—"The reign of Hezekiah was characterized by a series of
remarkable providences, which revealed to the surrounding nations that,
                                f8
the God of Israel was with His people. The success of the Assyrians in
capturing Samaria and in scattering the shattered remnant of the ten
tribes among the nations, during the earlier portion of his reign, was
leading many to question the power of the God of the Hebrews. . . .
Not until some years later, toward the close of Hezekiah's reign, was
it to be demonstrated before the nations of the world whether the gods
of the heathen were finally to prevail."—"Prophets and Kings," p. 339.
     3. In the fourteenth year of Hezekiah's reign, who came up to at-
tempt the conquest of Judah? What demand did the king of Assyria
make upon Hezekiah? How was Hezekiah enabled to pay so large a
sum? Verses 13-16.
     NOTE.—"To raise this sum, he was forced to empty not only the public
treasuries, but to take the golden plate off from the doors of the temple,
and from the pillars."—Matthew Henry.
     4. In spite of Hezekiah's payment of this large sum of money, where
did the Assyrian king place his army? Verse 17.
     5. How did Rabshakeh seek to shake the faith and the loyalty of the
people of Judah? Verses 19, 20, 25, 28-32.
     6. How did Rabshakeh exalt his king and compare the idols with the
true God? What had the people been instructed to do? How did they
respond? To whom did Hezekiah's messengers bring word of the inter-
view? Verses 33-37.
     7. When Hezekiah received the message, what did he do? Where
did he go? To whom did he send for counsel? 2 Kings 19:1-5.
     8. What word came to Hezekiah through the prophet Isaiah? Verses
6, 7.
     9. When again Hezekiah received letters from the king of Assyria,
what did he do? What appeal did he make? To whom? Verses 14-19.
    10. Who brought God's response? What did the Lord say concern-
ing the king of Assyria? For whose sake did the Lord defend Jerusa-
lem? Verses 20, 32-34.
    11. How were the words of the Lord fulfilled that very night? What
became of Sennacherib? Verses 35-37.
    NOTE.—"Tidings of this terrible judgment upon the army that had
been sent to take Jerusalem, soon reached Sennacherib, who was still
guarding the approach to Judea from Egypt. Stricken with fear, the
Assyrian king hasted to depart, and 'returned with shame of face to his
own land.' . . . The God of the Hebrews had prevailed over the proud
Assyrian. The honor of Jehovah was vindicated in the eyes of the sur-
rounding nations. In Jerusalem the hearts of the people were filled with
holy joy. Their earnest entreaties for deliverance had been mingled with
confession of sin and with many tears. In their great need they had
trusted wholly in the power of God to save, and He had not failed them.
Now the temple courts resounded with songs of solemn praise."—
"Prophets and Kings," pp. 361, 362.
                                    L9]
    12. After these days, what befell Hezekiah? Unto whom did he turn
in this trouble? For what did he pray? 2 Kings 20:1-3.
    NOTE.—"In the midst of his prosperous reign, King Hezekiah was
suddenly stricken with a fatal malady. 'Sick unto death,' his case was
beyond the power of man to help. . . . The outlook seemed utterly dark;
yet the king could still pray to the One who had hitherto been his 'refuge
and strength, a very present help in trouble.' . . . He whose 'compas-
sions fail not,' heard the prayer of His servant."—Id., pp. 340, 341.
    13. What message did God send him? How long was he permitted
to live? What simple remedy was used of God to heal the king?
Verses 4-7.
    14. How did God definitely indicate that He would fulfill His prom-
ise? Verses 8-11.
    NomE.—"Only by the direct interposition of God could the shadow
on the sundial be made to turn back ten degrees; and this was to be the
sign to Hezekiah that the Lord had heard his prayer."—Id., p. 342.
    15. Who sent friendly messengers to Hezekiah following his illness?
What did Hezekiah show them? Verses 12, 13.
    Nova.—"In the fertile valleys of the Tigris and the Euphrates there
dwelt an ancient race which, though at that time subject to Assyria,
was destined to rule the world. Among its people were wise men who
gave much attention to the study of astronomy; and when they noticed
that the shadow on the sundial had been turned back ten degrees, they
marveled greatly. Their king, Merodach-baladan, upon learning that
this miracle had been wrought as a sign to the king of Judah that the
God of heaven had granted him a new lease of life, sent ambassadors to
Hezekiah to congratulate him on his recovery, and to learn, if possible,
more of the God who was able to perform so great a wonder. The visit
of these messengers from the ruler of a far-away land gave Hezekiah
an opportunity to extol the living God."—Id., p. 344.
   16. When asked by Isaiah what he had shown the messengers, what
was Hezekiah's reply? Verses 14, 15.
    17. In consequence of Hezekiah's failure to bear witness to the good-
ness of God, what would come to pass? What was Hezekiah's response?
Verses 16-19.
    NomE.—"Pride and vanity took possession of Hezekiah's heart, and
in self-exaltation he laid open to covetous eyes the treasures with which
God had enriched His people. . . . Had Hezekiah improved the oppor-
tunity given him to bear witness to the power, the goodness, the com-
passion, of the God of Israel, the report of the ambassadors would have
been as light piercing darkness. But he magnified himself above the
Lord of hosts. He 'rendered not again according to the benefit done
unto him; for his heart was lifted up.' . . . The story of Hezekiah's
failure to prove true to his trust at the time of the visit of the ambassa-
dors, is fraught with an important lesson for all. Far more than we do,
we need to speak of the precious chapters in our experience, of the mercy
and loving-kindness of God, of the matchless depths of the Saviour's
                                    [ 10 ]
love. When mind and heart are filled with the love of God, it will not be
difficult to impart that which enters into the spiritual life."—Id., pp.
344-348.
   18. For what building work is Hezekiah mentioned? At his death,
who reigned in Judah? Verses 20, 21.
                         MEDITATION TOPICS
    1. A life of consecration to God may be fatally marred by one rash
act inspired by pride or selfishness.
    2. Our influence touches others around us in an ever-widening circle
throughout the passing years.
    3. God answered Hezekidh's prayer because Hezekiah was loyal. He
will do as much for you.
    4. Does there seem to be a thread of selfishness in Hezekiah's response
to the sentence pronounced upon the kingdom of Judah?


                     Lesson 4—July 26, 1930
          Judah Carried Captive to Babylon
MEMORY VERSE: Jer. 38:20.
LESSON HELP: "Prophets and Kings," pp. 381-463.
                            INTRODUCTION
   "God had pleaded with Judah not to provoke Him to anger, but
they had hearkened not. Finally sentence was pronounced against them.
They were to be led away captive to Babylon. The Chaldeans were to
be used as the instrument by which God would chastise His disobedient
people. The sufferings of the men of Judah were to be in proportion to
the light they had had, and to the warnings they had despised and re-
jected. Long had God delayed His judgments; but now He would visit
His displeasure upon them, as a last effort to check them in their evil
course."—"Prophets and Kings," p. 425.
                              THE LESSON
    1. Following the good king Hezekiah, who ascended the throne of
Judah? What course did he follow in his relation to God? 2 Kings 21:1,2.
    NOTE.—"The kingdom of Judah, prosperous throughout the times of
Hezekiah, was once more brought low during the long years of Manas-
seh's wicked reign, when paganism was revived, and many of the people
were led into idolatry."—"Prophets and Kings," p. 381.
    2. What good king followed Manasseh's son Amon? How is his
reign described? 2 Kings 22:1, 2.
    NOTE.—"Born of a wicked king, beset with temptations to follow in
his father's steps, and with few counselors to encourage him in the right
way, Josiah nevertheless was true to the God of Israel. Warned by the
errors of past generations, he chose to do right, instead of descending
to the low level of sin and degradation to which his father and his grand-
                                   [ 111
father had fallen. He 'turned not aside to the right hand or to the left.'
As one who was to occupy a position of trust, he resolved to obey the in-
struction that had been given for the guidance of Israel's rulers; and his
obedience made it possible for God to use him as a vessel unto honor."
—Id., p. 384.
    3. During the days of these kings, what prophets were warning Israel
concerning the sure punishment of their sins?
    Answer: Isaiah (Isa. 1 :1 ; "Prophets and Kings," p. 382), Zepha-
niah (Zeph. 1 :1), Habakkuk (Hab. 1 :1, margin; "Prophets and Kings,"
pp. 382-391 ) , Jeremiah (Jer. 1 :1-3 ; "Prophets and Kings,"pp. 407-421 ).
    4. When Josiah was slain at Megiddo, whom did the people anoint
in his stead? How long did he reign? hat brought about his down-
fall? 2 Kings 23:30-33.
   5. Whom did Pharaoh-nechoh then place upon the throne of Judah?
Verse 34.
     6. When Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, drove the Egyptian
kings beyond the river of Egypt, who became his servant? When Je-
hoiakim rebelled, who were sent against him? With what result? 2 Kings
24 : 1-4, 7.
    NoTE.—"The first years of Jehoiakim's reign were filled with warn-
ings of approaching doom. . . . Within a few short years the king of
Babylon was to be used as the instrument of God's wrath upon impeni-
tent Judah. Again and again Jerusalem was to be invested and entered
by the besieging armies of Nebuchadnezzar. Company after company
—at first a few only, but later on thousands and tens of thousands—
were to be taken captive to the land of Shinar, there to dwell in enforced
exile. Jehoiakim, Jehoiachin, Zedekiah,—all these Jewish kings were
in turn to become vassals of the Babylonian ruler, and all in turn were
to rebel. Severer and yet more severe chastisements were to be inflicted
upon the rebellious nation, until at last the entire land was to become a
desolation, Jerusalem was to be laid waste and burned with fire, the
temple that Solomon had built was to be destroyed, and the kingdom of
Judah was to fall, never again to occupy its former position among the
nations of earth."—Id., pp. 422, 423.
    7. During the reign of Jehoiakim, what prophet brought constant
and solemn warning to the king? How did he show disregard for the
messages sent to him? Jer. 36:1-4, 20-26.
    NOTE.—"The burning of the roll was not the end of the matter. The
written words were more easily disposed of than the reproof and warn-
ing they contained and the swift-coming punishment God had pronounced
against rebellious Israel. . . . It was God's purpose that Jehoiakim
should heed the counsels of Jeremiah, and thus win favor in the eyes of
Nebuchadnezzar, and save himself much sorrow. The youthful king had
sworn allegiance to the Babylonian ruler; and had he remained true to
his promise, he would have commanded the respect of the heathen, and
this would have led to precious opportunities for the conversion of souls."
—Id., pp. 436-438.
                                   [12]
   8. Among those taken captive to Babylon at the time of Jehoiakim's
capture, what young men were included? Dan. 1:1-3, 6.
  9. Who followed Jehoiakim as king of Judah? How old was he?
How did he relate himself to God? 2 Kings 24:6, 8, 9.
    10. At the beginning of Jehoiachin's reign, who besieged Jerusalem?
Who went out to him? What did Nebuchadnezzar do with the treasures
of the Lord's house and the king's house? Verses 10-13.
   11. Whom did the king of Babylon carry with him? Who were al-
lowed to remain? Verses 14-16.
   12. What individual was set up in Jehoiachin's stead? What course
did he take before the Lord? What was he led to do? Verses 17-20.
    13. In the ninth year of Zedekiah's reign, who again besieged Jeru-
salem? For how long? To what condition was the city brought? 2 Kings
25:1-3.
    NOTE.—"Through Daniel and others of the Hebrew captives, the
Babylonian monarch had been made acquainted with the power and su-
preme authority of the true God; and when Zedekiah once more solemnly
promised to remain loyal, Nebuchadnezzar required him to swear to this
promise in the name of the Lord God of Israel. Had Zedekiah respected
this renewal of his covenant oath, his loyalty would have had a profound
influence on the minds of many who were watching the conduct of those
who claimed to reverence the name and to cherish the honor of the God
of the Hebrews."—Id., p. 447.
    14. In the midst of the siege, what did the men of war and the king
do? Where was he overtaken by the Chaldees? What was done to him
and to his sons? Verses 4-7.
    15. Following the taking of Jerusalem, what fate befell the city?
Verses 8-10.
    NomE.—"The weakness of Zedekiah was a sin for which he paid a
fearful penalty. The enemy swept down like a resistless avalanche, and
devastated the city. The Hebrew armies were beaten back in confusion.
 The nation was conquered. Zedekiah was taken prisoner, and his sons
 were slain before his eyes. The king was led away from Jerusalem a
 captive, his eyes were put out, and after arriving in Babylon he perished
 miserably. The beautiful temple that for more than four centuries had
 crowned the summit of Mount Zion, was not spared by the Chaldeans."
 —Id., pp. 458, 459.
    16. What was done with those loyal to King Zedekiah? Who alone
 were permitted to remain? What was done with the brass work of the
 temple? Verses 11-17.
    17. How did the Chaldean captain dispose of the priests? Verses
18-21.
    18. After thirty-seven years of imprisonment, what changed condi-
tion came to Jehoiachin in Babylon? Verses 27-30.
                                    [ 13 ]
                        MEDITATION TOPICS
    1. An alliance with apparently powerful interests in this world is
often a source of weakness rather than strength. On whom do I depend?
    2. Rebellion against God inevitably brings its own punishment. Do
I realize that the laws of His kingdom are the laws of life?
    3. Often the innocent must suffer with the guilty. When this is my
experience, do I meet the situation with resignation or with a rebellious
spirit?
    4. Contrast two scenes: First scene: A large company of Israelites
marching out of Egypt, away from captivity, through the desert, toward
the Land of Promise. They are guided, protected, and provided for, and
victoriously enter the land given them by the Lord.
    Second scene: A sad procession of men, women, and children go out
of the Land of Promise, broken in spirit, and journey toward Babylon,
captives of the king of a heathen country.


                   Lesson 5 — August 2, 19 3 0

      Trained to Loyalty; The King's Dream
MEMORY VERSE: Isa. 43:10.
LESSON HELPS: "Prophets and Kings," pp. 479-502.
                           INTRODUCTION
    "Among the children of Israel who were carried captive to Babylon
at the beginning of the seventy years' captivity were Christian patriots,
men who were as true as steel to principle, who would not be corrupted
by selfishness, but who would honor God at the loss of all things. In the
land of their captivity these men were to carry out God's purpose by
giving to heathen nations the blessings that come through a knowledge
of Jehovah. They were to be His representatives. Never were they to
compromise with idolaters; their faith and their name as worshipers
of the living God they were to bear as a high honor. And this they did.
In prosperity and adversity they honored God; and God honored them."
—"Prophets and Kings," p. 479.
                            THE LESSON
    1. When Nebuchadnezzar besieged Jerusalem, whom did the Lord
give into his hands? What did the king of Babylon do with the vessels
of the Lord? Dan. 1:1, 2.
    2. What command did Nebuchadnezzar give concerning certain of
the children of Israel? What were the qualifications required in these
young men? Verses 3, 4.
    3. What was the king's purpose for them? What provision did he
make for their sustenance? Verse 5.
    NOTE.—"The king did not compel the Hebrew youth to renounce
their faith in favor of idolatry, but he hoped to bring this about grad-
”ally. By giving them names significant of idolatry, by bringing them
                                   [14 1
daily into close association with idolatrous customs, and under the in-
fluences of the seductive rites of heathen worship, he hoped to induce
them to renounce the religion of their nation, and to unite with the
worship of the Babylonians."—"Prophets and Kings," p. 481.
    4. Who among those selected are mentioned by name? Who early
appeared as a leader among them? What loyalty to principle did Daniel
and his companions show? Verses 6-8.
    NOTE.—"At the very outset of their career there came to them a de-
cisive test of character. It was provided that they should eat of the
food and drink of the wine that came from the king's table. In this the
king thought to give them an expression of his favor and of his solici-
tude for their welfare. But a portion having been offered to idols, the
food from the king's table was consecrated to idolatry.; and one par-
taking of it would be regarded as offering homage to the gods of Baby-
lon. In such homage, loyalty to Jehovah forbade Daniel and his com-
panions to join. Even a mere pretense of eating the food or drinking
the wine would be a denial of their faith. To do this would be to array
themselves with heathenism, and to dishonor the principles of the law
of God. Nor dared they risk the enervating effect of luxury and dissi-
pation on physical, mental, and spiritual development. . . . But Daniel
did not hesitate. The approval of God was dearer to him than the favor
of the most powerful earthly potentate—dearer than life itself. He de-
termined to stand firm in his integrity, let the result be what it might."
—Id., pp. 481-483.
    5. What was Daniel's relation to the chief eunuch? What request did
Daniel make for himself and his companions? What was the result of
this test? Verses 9-16.
    NOTE.—"At the end of the ten days' trial, the result was found to be
the opposite of the prince's fears. . . . In personal appearance the He-
brew youth showed a marked superiority over their companions. As a
result, Daniel and his associates were permitted to continue their simple
diet during their entire course of training."—Id., p. 484.
    6. What did God give to these faithful young men? What special
gift was bestowed upon Daniel? At the end of the days, in what con-
dition did Nebuchadnezzar find them? How long did Daniel remain con-
nected with the ruling power in Babylon? Verses 17-21.
    NOTE.—"In acquiring the wisdom of the Babylonians, Daniel and
his companions were far more successful than their fellow students; but
their learning did not come by chance. They obtained their knowledge
by the faithful use of their powers, under the guidance of the Holy
Spirit. They placed themselves in connection with the Source of all
 wisdom, making the knowledge of God the foundation of their educa-
 tion. In faith they prayed for wisdom, and they lived their prayers.
 They placed themselves where God could bless them. They avoided that
 which would weaken their powers, and improved every opportunity to
 become intelligent in all lines of learning. . . God Himself was their
 teacher. Constantly praying, conscientiously studying, keeping in touch
 with the Unseen, they walked with God as did Enoch. True success in
 any line of work is not the result of chance or accident or destiny. It
                                     151
 is the outworking of God's providences, the reward of faith and dis-
 cretion, of virtue and perseverance. Fine mental qualities and a high
 moral tone are not the result of accident. God gives opportunities; suc-
 cess depends upon the use made of them."—Id., p. 486.
     7. In the second year of Nebuchadnezzar's reign, what experience
 came to him? Upon whom did he call for an interpretation? With what
 result? Daniel 2:1-9.
     8. What admission did the Chaldeans make? Who did they say could
 tell the dream? What effect did their admission have on the king?
 Verses 10-12.
     9. What command was given by Nebuchadnezzar? Who were sought
 out? What did Daniel say to Arioch? What did he say to the king?
Verses 13-16.
     10. Granted additional time, to whom did Daniel at once go? What
did he and his companions unitedly do? Verses 17, 18.
     NomE.—"To this request the monarch acceded. 'Then Daniel went
to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Aza-
riah, his companions.' Together they sought for wisdom from the Source
of light and knowledge. Their faith was strong in the consciousness that
God had placed them where they were, that they were doing His work
and meeting the demands of duty. In times of perplexity and danger
they had always turned to Him for guidance and protection, and He had
proved an ever-present help. Now with contrition of heart they sub-
mitted themselves anew to the Judge of the earth, pleading that He
would grant them deliverance in this their time of special need. And
they did not plead in vain. The God whom they had honored, now hon-
ored them."—Id., pp. 493, 494.
     11. How was the king's dream revealed to Daniel? How did he ex-
press his gratitude? Verses 19-23.
     12. To whom did Daniel then go? What was said when Arioch
brought Daniel before the king? To whom did Daniel give the credit
for the revelation received? 'Verses 24-28.
     13. What was the appearance of the image which the king had seen
in his dream? Verses 31-35.
     14 What was the meaning of the dream as interpreted by Daniel?
Verses 36-45.
     NOTE.—"In the annals of human history, the growth of nations, the
rise and fall of empires, appear as if dependent on the will and prowess
of man; the shaping of events seems, to a great degree, to be determined
by his power, ambition, or caprice. But in the word of God the curtain
is drawn aside, and we behold, above, behind, and through all the play
and counterplay of human interest and power and passions, the agen-
cies of the, All-merciful One, silently, patiently working out the counsels
of His own will."—Id., pp. 499, 500.
     15. How did Nebuchadnezzar show his appreciation of the interpre-
tatiOn of hiE dream? What did he acknowledge? Verses 46, 47.
                                   [ 16]
    16. What honors came to Daniel and his fellows consequent upon
their faithfulness and loyalty to God? Verses 48, 49.
    17. How does this lesson apply to us to-day?
    NOTE.—"As God called Daniel to witness for Him in Babylon, so He
calls us to be His witnesses in the world to-day. In the smallest as well
as the largest affairs of life, He desires us to reveal to men the princi-
ples of His kingdom. Many are waiting for some great work to be
brought to them, while daily they lose opportunities for revealing faith-
fulness to God. Daily they fail of discharging with whole-heartedness
the little duties of life. While they wait for some large work in which
they may exercise supposedly great talents, and thus satisfy their am-
bitious longings, their days pass away."—Id., pp. 487, 488.
                         MEDITATION TOPICS
    1. God recognizes and rewards loyalty to principle.
    2. To whom do I go in the hour of need for wisdom and revelation"
    3. God desires us to witness for Him in the smallest as well as the
largest affairs of life.

  A King's Pride Humbled; The Handwriting
                 on the Wall
MEMORY VERSE: Dan. 4:27.
LESSON HELP: "Prophets and Kings," pp. 514-538.
                            INTRODUCTION
    "The dream of the great image, opening before Nebuchadnezzar
events reaching to the close of time, had been given that he might under-
stand the part he was to act in the world's history, and the relation that
his kingdom should sustain to the kingdom of heaven. In the interpre-
tation of the dream, he had been plainly instructed regarding the es-
tablishment of God's everlasting kingdom."—"Prophets and Kings,"
p. 503.
    "The thought of establishing the empire and a dynasty that should
endure forever, appealed very strongly to the mighty ruler before whose
arms the nations of earth had been unable to stand. With an enthusiasm
born of boundless ambition and selfish pride, he entered into counsel
with his wise men as to how to bring this about. Forgetting the re-
markable providences connected with the dream of the great image;
forgetting also that the God of Israel through His servant Daniel had
made plain the significance of the image, and that in connection with
this interpretation the great men of the realm had been saved an igno-
minious death; forgetting all except their desire to establish their own
power and supremacy, the king and his counselors of state determined
that by every means possible they would endeavor to exalt Babylon as
supreme, and worthy of universal allegiance."—Id., pp. 504, 505.
                                   [ 17 ]
                              THE LESSON •
     1. With what acknowledgment of God's wisdom and power does
 Nebuchadnezzar introduce the experience of his being humbled by the
 Lord? Dan. 4:1-3. .                                     •
     2. By what experience had Nebuchadnezzar previously been taught
 the power of God in the affairs of men? Daniel 3.
    Answer : The protection of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the
 fiery furnace.
     3. What was Nebuchadnezzar's state when God spoke to him in a
 dream? What effect had the dream on him? For whom did he call?
 Dan. 4:4-7.
     NOTE.—"In mercy God gave the king another dream, to warn him
of his peril, and of the snare that had been laid for his ruin."---"Proph-
ets and Kings," p. 515.
     4. Who finally came to him? What did the king acknowledge con-
cerning Daniel? What had the king first seen in the dream? Verses 8-12.
     5. When a holy watcher came down from heaven, what did he com-
mand? What in these commands indicated that the experience of a hu-
man being was the objective of the dream? Verses 13-16.
     6. What was the purpose of the° holy ones in bringing this revela-
tion to Nebuchadnezzar? Why did the king call upon Daniel for help?
Verses 17, 18.
     7. What effect did this dream have upon Daniel? When urged by
the king, how did he interpret the dream? Verses 19-26.
     8. What good counsel did Daniel give the king? How long after-
wards was the king found boasting in his pride? While exalting himself,
what did a voice say to him? What great change came immediately to
Nebuchadnezzar? Verses 27-33.
     NOTE.—"For a time the impression of the warning and the counsel
of the prophet was strong upon Nebuchadnezzar;, but the heart that is
not transformed by the grace of God soon loses the impressions of the
Holy Spirit. Self-indulgence and ambition had not yet been eradicated
from the king's heart, and later on these traits reappeared. . . . In a
moment the reason that God had given him was taken away; the judg-
ment that the king thought perfect, the wisdom on which he prided him-
self, was removed, and the once mighty ruler was a maniac. His hand
could no longer sway the scepter."—Id., pp. 519, 520.
     9. In what words does King Nebuchadnezzar, on his restoration to
sanity, acknowledge the majesty and mercy of God? Verses 34-37.
     NOTE.—"God's purpose that the greatest kingdom in the world should
show forth His praise, was now fulfilled. This public proclamation, in
which Nebuchadnezzar acknowledged the mercy and goodness and au-
thority of God, was the last act of his, life recorded in sacred history."
—Id.,. p. 521.
     10. In the days of Belshazzar, the.last king of Babylon, what great
feast did he make? Who were invited? How did he desecrate the vessels
                                   [18]
of the temple? While the revelers drank, whom did they praise? Dan.
5:1-4.
    11. What suddenly appeared to the alarmed vision of the king? How
deeply did it affect him? For whom did he call? What promise did he
make? But what could his wise men not do? Verses 5-8.
    NOTE.—"Little did Belshazzar think that there was a heavenly Wit-
ness to his idolatrous revelry; that a divine Watchei, unrecognized,
looked upon the scene of profanation, heard the sacrilegious mirth, be-
held the idolatry. But soon the uninvited Guest oade His presence felt.
When the revelry was at its height, a bloodless hand came forth, and
traced upon the walls of the palace characters that gleamed like fire,—
words which, though unknown to the vast throng, were a portent of doom
to the now conscience-stricken king and his guests."—Id., p. 524.
    12. What effect did the failure of the wise men have on the king and
his lords? Who came to the king's assistance? What counsel did the
queen give to the king? Verses 9-12.
    13. When Daniel was brought in, what acknowledgments did Bel-
shazzar make? What promises? On what basis was Daniel willing to
tell the interpretation? Verses 13-17.
    14. Of what experiences did Daniel then remind Belshazzar? Of
what did he accuse him? What final act of rebellion had he performed?
From whom had the hand come? Verses 18-24.
    NOTE.—"Belshazzar had not read aright the experience of his grand-
father, nor heeded the warning of events so significant to himself. The
opportunity of knowing and obeying the true God had been given him,
but had not been taken to heart, and he was about to reap the conse-
quence of his rebellion."—Id., p. 529.
    15. What words had been written? How was each interpreted?
Verses 25-28.
    NOTE.—"In that last night of mad folly, Belshazzar and his lords
had filled up the measure of their guilt and the guilt of the Chaldean
kingdom. No longer could God's restraining hand ward off the impend-
ing evil. . . . Because of the strange perversity of the human heart,
God had at last found it necessary to pass the irrevocable sentence. Bel-
shazzar was to fall, and his kingdom was to pass into other hands."—
Id., p. 530.
    16. Hew fully was the king's promise of preferment carried out?
Verse 29.
    17. How swiftly did retribution come to Belshazzar? Who took the
kingdom? Verses 30, 31.
     NomE.—“Even while he [Belshazzar] and his nobles were drinking
from the sacred vessels of Jehovah, and praising their gods of silver
and of gold, the Medes and the Persians, having turned the Euphrates
out of its channel, were marching into the heart of the unguarded city.
The army of Cyrus now stood under the walls of the palace; the city
was filled with the soldiers of the enemy, 'as with caterpillars;' and their
                                   [ 19
triumphant shouts could be heard above the despairing cries of the
astonished revelers."—Id., p. 531.
                          MEDITATION TOPICS
    1. Human pride frustrates the plans of the Infinite for man. Often
God brings home a lesson in humility in the hour of our most intense
self-exaltation.
    2. It is as necessary for us to recognize that God rules in the affairs
of men as it was for Nebuchadnezzar. Do I do so in life's daily affairs?
    3. To violate knoWingly the laws of life is as truly desecration of the
temple of God as Belshazzar's use of the golden vessels. Do I offend in
this way?
    4. While we revel in false security, the enemy enters the citadel and
takes possession of our souls.


                   Lesson 7—August 16, 1930
                 The Days of Queen Esther
MEMORY VERSE: Luke 14:11.
LESSON HELP: "Prophets and Kings," pp. 598-606.
                             INTRODUCTION
    "Under the favor shown them by Cyrus, nearly fifty thousand of the
children of the captivity had taken advantage of the decree permitting
their return [to their Judean home]. These, however, in comparison with•
the hundreds of thousands scattered throughout the provinces of Medo-
Persia, were but a mere remnant. The great majority of the Israelites
had chosen to remain in the land of their exile, rather than undergo the
hardships of the return journey and the reestablishment of their deso-
lated cities and homes."
    "Meanwhile conditions in the Medo-Persian realm were rapidly
changing. Darius Hystaspes, under whose reign the Jews had been
shown marked favor•, was succeeded by Xerxes the Great. It was during
his reign that those of the Jews who had failed of heeding the message
to flee, were called upon to face a terrible crisis. Having refused to take
advantage of the way of escape God had provided, now they were
brought face to face with death."—"Prophets and Kings," pp. 598, 600.
                            THE LESSON
   1. In the third year of Ahasuerus (Xerxes), king of Persia, what
great celebration took place? How many of the princes were present?
Following the feast of the princes, what feast was given? At the same
time, what did Queen Vashti do? Esther 1:1-9.
   2. What command was given to the king's chamberlains on the
seventh day of the feast? How did Queen Vashti respond? Verses 10-12.
   3. Because of the queen's refusal to obey the king's command, what
punishment was determined upon? What universal order was issued to
husbands and wives? Verses 13, 15, 19-22.
                                  20]
    4. Later when the king's anger was appeased, what plan was pro-
posed by the king's servants? What Jew is mentioned as living in Shu-
shan? Whom had he brought up as his daughter? Esther 2:1-7.
    5. When Esther was brought to the custody of the keeper of the
king's women, how was she received? What interest did Mordecai con-
tinue to take in her? Verses 8-11.
    6. When Esther's turn came to go before the king, what was the
result? Verses 15, 17.
    7. What did she not reveal concerning herself? What plot was over-
heard by Mordecai and revealed to the king? Where was this account
written? Verses 20-23.
    8. Who was at this time advanced by the king? Who alone refused
Haman homage? Against whom did Haman plot? Esther 3:1-6.
    NOTE.—"Through Haman the Agagite, an unscrupulous man high
in authority in Medo-Persia, Satan worked at this time to counterwork
the purposes of God. Haman cherished bitter malice against Mordecai,
a Jew. Mordecai had done Haman no harm, .but had simply refused to
show him worshipful reverence. Scorning to 'lay hands on Mordecai
alone,' Haman plotted 'to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the
whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai.' "—"Proph-
ets and Kings," p. 600.
    9. What clever plan did Haman lay before the king? Having re-
ceived the king's permission and his signet ring, what order did he send
to all the provinces? Verses 8-14.
    NOTE.—"Misled by the false statements of Haman, Xerxes was in-
duced to issue a decree providing for the massacre of all the Jews
`scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces'
of the Medo-Persian kingdom. A certain day was appointed on which
the Jews were to be destroyed and their property confiscated. Little
 did the king realize the far-reaching results that would have accom-
 panied the complete carrying out of this decree. Satan himself, the
 hidden instigator of the scheme, was trying to rid the earth of those
 who preserved the knowledge of the true God."—Id., pp. 600, 601.
    10. What effect did the decree have upon Mordecai and the Jews?
Esther 4:1-3.
    11. To whom did news of Mordecai's fasting come? On the queen's
 request, what information was sent by Mordecai? What charge did he
 give her? Verses 4-9.

                                 [ 211
    12. In her reply, of what did Esther remind Mordecai? What warn-
ing did Mordecai send to her? Verses 10-14.
    13. What request did Esther make of Mordecai and all the Jews in
Shushan? Verses 15-17.
    NomE.—"The plots of the enemy were defeated by a Power that
reigns among the children of men. In the providence of God, Esther,
a Jewess who feared the Most High, had been made queen of the Medo-
Persian kingdom. . . . The crisis that Esther faced demanded quick,
earnest action ; but both she and Mordecai realized that unless God
should work mightily in their behalf, their own efforts would be un-
availing. So Esther took time for communion with God, the source of
her strength."—Id., p. 601.
    14. How was Esther received by the king? What desire did Esther
express? When Haman reported the invitation to the banquet to his
family, for what did they plan because of Mordecai? Esther 5:2, 4,
5, 8, 14.
    15. What broke the sleep of King Ahasuerus the following night?
As a result, what sudden honor came to Mordecai? Esther 6:1-3, 7-11.
    16. At the second banquet, what plot was revealed to the king? What
was the result of this revelation? Esther 7:3-6, 10.
    17. On Esther's appeal; what authority was intrusted to Esther and
Mordecai? Although the decree against the Jews could not be changed,
what message of relief was sent throughout the provinces? How fully
was Mordecai honored? Esther 8:8-15.
    NOTE.—"The events that followed in rapid succession,—the appear-
ance of Esther before the king, the marked favor shown her, the ban-
quets of the king and queen with Haman as the only guest, the troubled
sleep of the king, the public honor shown Mordecai, and the humilia-
tion and fall of Haman upon the discovery of his wicked plot,—all these
are parts of a familiar story. God wrought marvelously for His peni-
tent people; and a counter decree issued by the king, allowing them to
fight for their lives, was rapidly communicated to every part of the
realm by mounted couriers, who were 'hastened and pressed on by the
king's commandment.' "—Id., p. 602.
    18. What is said of the exalted place held by Mordecai in his later
years? Esther 10:1-3.
    19. When will a similar decree to that of Ahasuerus be issued against
God's people?
    NOTE.—"The decree that will finally go forth against the remnant
people of God will be very similar to that issued by Ahasuerus against
the Jews. To-day the enemies of the true church see in the little com-
pany keeping the Sabbath commandment, a Mordecai at the gate. The
reverence of God's people for His law, is a constant rebuke to thoSe
who have cast off the fear of the Lord, and are trampling on His Sabbath.
    "Satan will arouse indignation against the minority who refuse to
accept popular customs and traditions. Men of position and reputation
will join with the lawless and the vile to take counsel against the people
                                   [ 22 ]
of God. Wealth, genius, education, will combine to cover them with
contempt. Persecuting rulers, ministers, and church members will con-
spire against them. With voice and pen, by boasts, threats, and ridicule,
they will seek to overthrow their faith. By false representations and
angry appeals, men will stir up the passions of the people. Not having
a 'Thus saith the Scriptures' to bring against the advocates of the Bible
Sabbath, they will resort to oppressive enactments to supply the lack.
To secure popularity and patronage, legislators will yield to the demand
for Sunday laws. But those who fear God, cannot accept an institution
that violates a precept of the Decalogue. On this battlefield will be
fought the last great conflict in the controversy between truth and
error. And we are not left in doubt as to the issue. To-day, as in the
days of Esther and Mordecai, the Lord will vindicate His truth and
His people."—Id., pp. 605, 606.
                        MEDITATION TOPICS
    1. God has a special purpose in our lives, as He had with Queen
Esther. Do you recognize that life's duties to-day are a call to you to
risk all for His service and for His people?
    2. God honored Mordecai's fidelity and loyalty. He will no less honor
those qualities in His servants to-day.
    3. Retribution eventually follows any attempt to harm others.
"Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap."


                   Lesson 8—August 23, 1930

                  The Return From Exile
MEMORY VERSE: _Ter. 29 : 14.
LESSON HELP: "Prophets and Kings," pp. 551-581, 607-617.
                            INTRODUCTION
   Only a comparatively small number of those who had been carried
captive into Babylon were prepared to accept the call to return to Judea.
Those who did return were men and women who had kept in touch with
the divine will and purpose, and were prepared to meet the opposition
and endure the hardships incident to the restoration of the Holy City,
and the replanting of the wasted fields and vineyards of their homeland.
The struggles incident to the rebuilding of the temple were but a prel-
ude to more intense conflict in the rebuilding of the city walls, and the
work of restoration covered many years of conflict, with discouragement
and apathy on the part of the returned exiles themselves, and opposi-
tion, misrepresentation, and treachery from their neighbors. But even-
tually under Ezra and Nehemiah the work was completed and the land
restored.
                             THE LESSON
    1. What prophecy was fulfilled when Israel and Judah were taken
into captivity? Deut. 28:47-49, 64-68.
    NOTE.—In Deuteronomy 28:47-68 God reveals the overpowering
curse that would come to Israel as the result of disobedience. He pic-
                                 [ 23 ]
tures the attacks of the nations, the siege, the captivity, and the scatter-
ing of the majority of the tribes among earth's peoples.
   2. How long was Judah to remain in captivity? Jer. 29:10.
   3. Who is mentioned by name in Isaiah's prophecy as one who should
help Israel out of captivity? Isa. 44:28; 45:1-3.
   4. At the end of the period, whom did God stir up to carry out His
purpose for His children? What was this king instructed of God to do?
2 Chron. 36:22, 23; Ezra 1:1, 2.
    NOTE.—"Just at the time God had said He would cause His temple
at Jerusalem to be rebuilt, He moved upon Cyrus as His agent to dis-
cern the prophecies concerning himself, with which Daniel was so famil-
iar, and to grant the Jewish people their liberty. . . . His [Cyrus/
heart was profoundly moved, and he determined to fulfill his divinely
appointed mission. He would let the Judean captives go free; he would
help them restore the temple of Jehovah."—"Prophets and Kings," pp.
557, 558.
    5. What were the men of Judah called upon to do? What instruc-
tion was given to others regarding giving assistance? Ezra 1:3, 4.
    NOTE.—"Tidings of this decree reached the farthermost provinces of
the king's realm, and everywhere among the children of the dispersion
there was great rejoicing. Many, like Daniel, had been studying the
prophecies, and had been seeking God for His promised intervention in
behalf of Zion. And now their prayers were being answered."—Id., pp.
558, 559.
    6. Who were the first to respond? What was given them? What
articles did Cyrus add from the royal custody? Verses 5-11.
    7. What was the number of the whole congregation that returned
from captivity with the first company? Ezra 2:64-67.
  8. What was one of the first objectives to which they gave time and
means? Verses 68-70.
    NoTE.—"As speedily as possible, an altar was erected on the site
of the ancient altar in the temple court. . . 1. The setting up of the altar
of daily burnt offerings greatly cheered the faithful remnant. Heartily
they entered into the preparations necessary for the rebuilding of the
temple, gathering courage as these preparations advanced from month
to month. . . . With joyous anticipation they looked forward to the
time when, with temple rebuilt, they might behold the shining forth
of His glory from within."—Id., pp. 560, 563.
   9. What celebration was held when the foundations of the temple
were laid? Ezra 3:10-13.
   10. Who offered to help Judah in rebuilding the temple? What
reply did they receive? Ezra 4:1-3.
   11. What plotting continuously went forward against Judah?
Verses 4-6.
                                   [24)
    12. What complaint did their enemies make to Artaxerxes the king?
What occurred as a result of these conspiracies? Verses 11-24.
    NoTE.—"For over a year the temple was neglected, and well-nigh
forsaken. The people dwelt in their homes, and strove to attain tem-
poral prosperity; but their situation was deplorable. Work as they
might, they did not prosper. The very elements of nature seemed to
conspire against them. Because they had let the temple lie waste, the
Lord seat upon their substance a wasting drought. God had bestowed
upon them the fruits of field and garden, the corn and the wine and the
oil, as a token of His favor; but because they had used these bountiful
gifts so selfishly, the blessings were removed."—Id., p. 573.
     13. When Zerubbabel and Joshua began to go forward with the

     17. How many decrees for the restoration of Jerusalem and the
temple were made? By whom were they given? Verses 13-15.
     18. When did Ezra go up to Jerusalem? Who went with him? When
did he leave Babylon? In what month did he reach Jerusalem? Ezra
7:1-9.
     19. What commission did he carry from King Artaxerxes? Verses
11-13, 21-26.
     NoTE.—The decree of Artaxerxes permitted all Jews in his realm
 who were so minded to go to Jerusalem. It allowed taking with them
 silver and gold, the freewill offerings of the people. It also permitted
 their taking vessels for the service of the temple. Artaxerxes allotted a
 hundred talents of silver and a hundred measures each of wheat, wine,
 and oil, and salt unlimited, from the royal treasury, and gave permission
 for setting up magistrates and judges, with power of life and death.
     20. How does Ezra express his gratitude to God for these favors?
 Ezra 7:27, 28.
                            MEDITATION TOPICS
     1. God never punishes without holding before the offender hope of
 forgiveness and restoration if he repents and turns to Him.
     2. As God remembered His promise and brought His people from
 captivity to the Promised Land, so He will, according to His promise,
 bring His flock into the heavenly Canaan.
     3. No outside force or power can retard the work of God so long
 as He works for His people.

                   Lesson 9 — August 3 0, 193 0
          Rebuilding the Walls of Jerusalem
MEMORY VERSE: Neh. 4:9.
LESSON HELP: "Prophets and Kings," pp. 618-627, 635-645, 653-660.

                            INTRODUCTION
    "The opposition and discouragement that the builders in Nehemiah's
day met from open enemies and pretended friends, is typical of the ex-
perience that those to-day will have who work for God. Christians are
tried, not only by the anger, contempt, and cruelty of enemies, but by the
indolence, inconsistency, lukewarmness, and treachery of avowed friends
and helpers. Derision and reproach are hurled at them. And the same
enemy that leads to contempt, at a favorable opportunity uses more
cruel and violent measures. . . -. Like Nehemiah, God's people are
neither to fear nor to despise their enemies. Putting their trust in God,
they are to go steadily forward, doing His work with unselfishness, and
committing to His providence the cause for which they stand."—"Proph-
ets and Kings," pp. 644, 645.
                             THE LESSON
   1. When was the rebuilding of the temple at Jerusalem completed?
Who took a leading part in its dedication? For how long a period was
the feast of unleavened bread observed at the time of the dedication?
Ezra 6:15-22.
    2. During the reign of Artaxerxes, who from the priesthood went up
to Jerusalem? What did the king do for him? Who accompanied him?
Ezra 7:1-7.
    3. What did Ezra discover had taken place among those returned
from captivity? How did it affect him? Ezra 9:1-3.
    NOTE.—"In his study of the causes leading to the Babylonish cap-
tivity, Ezra had learned that Israel's apostasy was largely traceable to
their mingling with heathen nations. He had seen that if they had obeyed
God's command to keep separate from the nations surrounding them,
they would have been spared many sad and humiliating experiences.
Now when he learned that notwithstanding the lessons of the past, men
of prominence had dared transgress the laws given as a safeguard
against apostasy, his heart was stirred within him. He thought of God's
goodness in again giving His people a foothold in their native land,
and he was overwhelmed with righteous indignation and with grief at
their ingratitude."—Id., p. 620.
    4. Who assembled unto him? At the hour of evening sacrifice, for
what did Ezra pray? Verses 4-15.
   NOTE.—Those with Ezra were men who feared to disobey God. They
loved Him and mourned for the transgressions of Israel. At the time of
the evening sacrifice Ezra, in his prayer, first confessed the sins of the
people and their continued transgressions; and then asked if God would
                                  [26]
not consume them, till there should be neither remnant nor escaping if
they should continue to make affinity with surrounding nations.
   5. Where were the people gathered? Of what were they accused?
Ezra 10:9, 10. .
  6. What were they admonished to do? What promise did they make?
What did they request? Verses 11-14.
    7. When word 'of the distressing conditions existing in Jerusalem
came to Nehemiah, how did it affect him? For what did he pray?
Neh. 1:1-4, 11.
    NOTE.—"By messengers from Judea, the Hebrew patriot learned
that days of trial had come to Jerusalem, the chosen city. The returned
exiles were suffering affliction and reproach. The temple and portions
of the city had been rebuilt; but the work of restoration was hindered,
the temple services were disturbed, and the people kept in constant
alarm, by the fact that the walls of the city were still largely in ruins.
Overwhelmed with sorrow, Nehemiah could neither eat nor drink; he
`wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted.'"—Id., pp. 628, 629.
    8. When King Artaxerxes saw the sad countenance of Nehemiah,
his cup bearer, what inquiry did he make? What was he told? What
request did Nehemiah make? Neh. 2:1-5, 7, 8.
    9. When Nehemiah reached Jerusalem, what did he secretly do?
Verses 12-16.
    NOTE.—"On the third night after his arrival, Nehemiah rose at mid-
night, and with a few trusted companions, went out to view for himself
the desolation of Jerusalem. Mounted on his mule, he passed from one
part of the city to another, surveying the broken-down walls and gates
of the city of his fathers. . . . The remainder of the night he spent in
prayer; for he knew that the morning would call for earnest effort to
arouse and unite his dispirited and divided countrymen."—Id., pp.
636, 637.
    10. What did Nehemiah immediately urge upon the people? What
was their response? Who opposed them? What was Nehemiah's attitude
toward opposers? Verses 17-20.
    NOTE.—"Nehemiah bore a royal commission requiring the inhabit-
ants to cooperate with him in rebuilding the walls of the city, but he
did not depend upon the exercise of authority. He sought rather to gain
the confidence and sympathy of the people, knowing that a union of
hearts as well as of hands was essential in the great work before him.
When on the morrow he called the people together, he presented such
arguments as were calculated to arouse their dormant energies and
unite their scattered numbers. . .     Having shown that he was sus-
tained by the combined authority of the God of Israel and the Persian
king, Nehemiah asked the people directly whether they would take ad-
vantage of this opportunity, and arise and build the wall. The appeal
went straight to their hearts. The thought of how Heaven's favor had
been manifested toward them, put their fears to shame, and with new
                                   27
courage they said with one voice, 'Let us rise up and build.' So they
strengthened their hands for this good work.' "—Id., pp. 637, 638.
    11. When Sanballat, chief of one of the near-by heathen tribes,
reviled and mocked the Jews, to whom did Nehemiah go? Although he
prayed, what work was unhesitatingly continued? Neh. 4:1-6.
    12: When Sanballat was about to oppose by force of arms, what
provision against attack did Nehemiah make? Verses 9, 13-18.
    NOTE.—"As the enemies of Israel saw -how unavailing were their
efforts, they were filled with rage. . . . Now in their anger, they them-
selves became guilty of the crime of which they had accused Nehemiah."
—Id., p. 642.
    13. What new plan did Sanballat and Geshem make when the work
was almost completed? What was Nehemiah's response? Of what did
they accuse Nehemiah? Neh. 6:1-7.
    NOTE.—"Taunts and ridicule, opposition and threats, seemed only to
inspire Nehemiah with firmer determination, and to arouse him to greater
watchfulness."—Id.. p. 643.
    14. What new danger now threatened Nehemiah? What did Nehe-
miah discover concerning this advice from false friends? Verses 10-14.
    NOTE.—"Had Nehemiah followed this treacherous counsel, he would
have sacrificed his faith in God, and in the eyes of the people he would
have appeared cowardly and contemptible. In view of the important
work that he had undertaken, and the confidence that he professed to
have in the power of God, it would have been altogether inconsistent for
him to hide as if in fear. The alarm would have spread among the people,
each would have sought his own safety, and the city would have been
left unprotected. to fall a prey to its enemies. That one unwise move
on the part of Nehemiah would have been a virtual surrender of all that
had been gained."—Id.. p. 655.
    15. When the wall and gates were completed, who officiated at the
dedication? Who joined in the celebration? Neh. 12:27, 43.
                           MEDITATION TOPICS
    1. Any failure of the people of God to measure up to His expecta-
tion of them should bring sadness to His servants. How does it affect
you?      /
    2. When sin in our lives is made clear to us, there is but one remedy,
ridding our lives of it, and replacing it with righteousness,—the right-
eousness of Christ.
    3. When others falsely accuse or seek to mislead. safety lies in seek-
ing God and watching against the wrong while we continue our labor.
    4. What are the people of God commanded to build in this day?
Isa. 61:4. What will those who are called "repairers of the breach" be
doing in the last days? Isa. 58:12, 13.
   "Those who humbly and prayerfully search the Scriptures, to know
and to do God's will, will not be in doubt of their obligations to God."—

           Teaching the Law of God Anew
MEMORY VERSE: Neh. 8:8.
LESSON HELP: "Prophets and Kings," pp. 661-668.
                             INTRODUCTION
    "Among those who had returned to Jerusalem in former years, there
were many who had remained true to God as long as they lived; but a
considerable number of the children and the children's children lost
sight of the sacredness of God's law. Even some• of the men intrusted
with responsibilities were living in open sin. Their course was largely
neutralizing the efforts made by others to advance the cause of God;
for so long as flagrant violations of the law were allowed to go unre-
buked, the blessing of Heaven could not rest upon the people.
    "It was in the providence of God that those who returned with Ezra
bad had special seasons of seeking the Lord. The experiences through
which they had just passed, on their journey from Babylon, unprotected
as they had been by any human power, had taught them rich spiritual
lessons. Many had grown strong in faith; and as these mingled with the
discouraged and the indifferent in Jerusalem, their influence was a
powerful factor in the reform soon afterward instituted."—"Prophets
and Kings," pp. 618, 619.
    "The work of restoration and reform carried on by the returned
exiles, under the leadership, of Zerubbabel, Ezra, and Nehemiah, pre-
sents a picture of a work of spiritual restoration that is to be wrought
in the closing days of this earth's history."—Id., p. 677.
                             THE LESSON
    1. At the celebration of the Feast of Trumpets in Jerusalem, from
whom did a request come to Ezra for the reading of the law? Neh. 8:1.
    NorrE.—The request for the reading of the law came from the people
themselves. The stirring events that were occurring about them as they
sought to restore Jerusalem and the temple, the godly life and earnest-
ness of Nehemiah and Ezra, their leaders, coupled with the moving of
God's Holy Spirit upon their hearts, led to a sincere desire to know the
will of God. Their request was immediately granted, and the reading of
the law preceded a definite reformation in the hearts of the people.
   2. Who were included in the assembled congregation? For how long
did Ezra read? What was the people's attitude? Verses 2, 3.
   3. While reading, where did Ezra stand? Before reading, what did
Ezra do? How did the people respond? Verses 4-7.
  4. What is said of the reading of those appointed to this work?
What was added to the reading? Verse 8.
    5. What was the effect of the reading upon the people? What coun-
sel was given them? Verses 9-12.
    NOTE.—"This day was a festival, a day of rejoicing, a holy convo-
cation, a day which the Lord had commanded the people to keep with
                                 [ 29 ]
joy and gladness; and in view of this they were bidden to restrain their
grief, and to rejoice because of God's great mercy toward them."—
Id., p. 662.
    6. On the second day, who came together? Concerning what feast
were instructions found? What was done day by day in celebrating the
Feast of Tabernacles? Verses 13-18.
    7. What special service was held on the twenty-fourth day of the
first month? Neh. 9:1-3.
    NOTE.—"As they had listened from day to day to the words of the
law, the people had been convicted of their transgressions, and of the
sins of their nation in past generations. They saw that it was because
of a departure from God that His protecting care had been withdrawn,
and that the children of Abraham had been scattered in foreign lands;
and they determined to seek His mercy, and to pledge themselves to
walk in His commandments. Before entering upon this solemn service,
held on the second day after the close of the Feast of Tabernacles, they
separated themselves from the heathen among them.
    "As the people prostrated themselves before the Lord, confessing
their sins and pleading for pardon, their leaders encouraged them to
believe that God. according to His promise, beard their prayers. They
must not only mourn and weep, and repent, but they must believe that
God pardoned them. They must show their faith by recounting His
mercies and praising Him for His goodness."—Id., pp. 665, 666.
    8. In establishing the services of the temple, who had been forgotten
and neglected? What did Nehemiah do to change the situation? Neh.
13:10, 11.
    9. What did all Judah then do? Who were set over the treasuries?
Why were they chosen? Verses 12, 13.
    NoTE.—"Provision was also made to support the public worship of
God. In addition to the tithe, the congregation pledged themselves to
contribute yearly a stated sum for the service of the sanctuary."—Id.,
p. 667.
    10. What did Nehemiah see being done on the Sabbath? How did
he seek to stop this evil? Verse 15.
    11. What were the men of Tyre doing? With whom did Nehemiah
Contend concerning this profanation of the Sabbath? Verses 16-18.
    NOTE.—"Another result of intercourse with idolaters was a disre-
gard of the Sabbath, the sign distinguishing the Israelites from all other
nations as worshipers of the true God. Nehemiah found that heathen
merchants and traders from the surrounding country, coming to Jeru-
salem, had induced many among the Israelites to engage in traffic on
the Sabbath. There were some who could not be persuaded to sacrifice
principle; but others transgressed, and joined with the heathen in their
efforts to overcome the scruples of the more conscientious. Many dared
openly to violate the Sabbath."—Id., p. 671.
    12. At evening before the Sabbath, what was done at Nehemiah's
command? Where did these merchants lodge? What threat did Nehe-
miah make? With what result? Verses 19-21.
                                   L30 ]
   13. In the priesthood and among the people also, what other evil
custom had crept in? Verses 23-29.
    14. What did Nehemiah say he had accomplished in remedying the
situation? Verse 30.
    NOTE.—"There were some in sacred office who pleaded for their
heathen wives, declaring that they could not bring themselves to separate
from them. But no distinction was made; no respect was shown for
rank or position. . . . How much anguish of soul this needed severity
cost the faithful worker for God, the judgment alone will reveal. There
was a constant struggle with opposing elements; and only by fasting,
humiliation, and prayer, was advancement made. Many who had mar-
ried idolaters chose to go with them into exile; and these, with those
who had been expelled from the congregation, joined the Samaritans."
—Id., p. 674.
                         MEDITATION TOPICS
    1. God's Spirit prepares the heart, and creates a longing for a deeper
experience in God and a fuller knowledge of Him. Is that longing mine?
    2. Affiliation and companionship with worldlings creates a tendency
to look with complaisance, if not with favor, upon their careless ways.
    3. An alliance with the world ultimately results in complete separa-
tion from God. One can be restored only by repentance and reformation.


                Lesson 11—September 13, 1930
                 Looking for the Deliverer
MEMORY VERSE: Gen. 3:15.
LESSON HELP: "Prophets and Kings," pp. 681-702.
                            INTRODUCTION
    "Through the long centuries of 'trouble and darkness' and 'dimness
of anguish' marking the history of mankind from the day our first
parents lost their Eden home, to the time the Son of God appeared as the
Saviour of sinners, the hope of the fallen race was centered in the com-
ing of a Deliverer to free men and women from the bondage of sin and
the grave. . . . This hope of redemption through the advent of the Son
of God as Saviour and King, has never become extinct in the hearts of
men. From the beginning, there have been some whose faith has reached
out beyond the shadows of the present to the realities of the future."—
"Prophets and Kings," pp. 681, 682.
    "The many prophecies concerning the Saviour's advent, led the He-
brews to live in an attitude of constant expectancy. Many died in the
faith, not having received the promises. But having seen them afar off,
they believed and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on
the earth. From the days of Enoch the promises repeated through pa-
triarchs and prophets had kept alive the hope of His appearing."—Id.,
pp. 699, 700.
                                   [ 31 ]
                              THE LESSON
    1. To whom was the first promise made concerning the coming De-
liverer? Gen. 3:15.
    NOTE.—The apostle Paul, speaking of the seed of Abraham, says,
"He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy
seed, which is Christ." Gal. 3 :16. The seed referred to in Genesis 3:15 is
also Christ, the Redeemer, the Messiah, whose ancestry is traced directly
back to Adam and Eve. Luke 3 :38.
    2. Who was to receive a blessing through the seed of Abraham?
Gen. 12:3.
    NOTE.—"The hope of Israel was embodied in the promise made at
the time of the call of Abraham, and afterwards repeated again and
again to his posterity. . . . When, at last, the Saviour Himself walked
and talked among the sons of men, He bore witness to the Jews of the
patriarch's bright hope of deliverance through the coming of a Re-
deemer. 'Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day,' Christ declared;
'and he saw it, and was glad.' "—"Prophets and Kings," p. 683.
    3. When on his deathbed Jacob blessed hii sons, how did he express
his hope in a Deliverer? Gen. 49:10.
    NOTE.—As the patriarch Jacob lay dying, he called his sons to him
and gave them his parting blessing, prophesying the future of each. He
prophesied that Judah should be the royal line, and from the house of
Judah should Shiloh come who would gather Israel. The coming of the
Deliverer was the bright hope of patriarch and prophet from earliest
time.
    4. How is the Redeemer referred to in Deuteronomy 32:18? What
interpretation does the apostle Paul give to the Rock that guided Israel?
1 Cor. 10:4.
  5. What prophecy did Moses make concerning the coming of Jesus?
How was it fulfilled? Deut. 18:18, 19; Acts 3:22-24.
    6. What services of the children of Israel constantly foreshadowed
the coming of the Deliverer? Answer: The sacrificial services in the
sanctuary.
    NOTE.—"In patriarchal times the sacrificial offerings connected with
divine worship constituted a perpetual reminder of the coming of a
Saviour ; and thus it was with the entire ritual of the sanctuary services
throughout Israel's history. In the ministration of the tabernacle, and
of the temple that afterwards took its place, the people were taught
each day, by means of types and shadows, the great truths relative to
the advent of Christ as Redeemer, Priest, and King; and once each year
their minds were carried forward to the closing events of the great con-
troversy between Christ and Satan, the final purification of the universe
from sin and.sinners."—Id., pp. 684, 685.
 ' 7. What does the prophet Balaam say should appear out of Judah?
Num. 24 : 17.
    NOTE.—See Matthew 2:1, 2, 9, 10 for the fulfillment.
                               [32 ]
    8. How does the psalmist refer to the reception of the Redeemer
when He should appear? Ps. 118:22, 23.
   9. How does the psalmist speak of the work of the Redeemer while
among men? Ps. 40:6-10.
   10. How definitely is His birth predicted in the Old Testament scrip-
tures?
   Answer Birth—Isa. 9:6,7.
           Born of Virgin—Isa. 7:14.        Fulfillment—Matt. 1:21-23.
           Place of Birth—Micah 5:2.        Fulfillment—Matt. 2:1.
           Time of Birth—Dan. 9:24, 25.
     11. What prophecy was made concerning the forerunner of the Mes-
siah? In whom was this prophecy fulfilled? Isa. 40:3; John 1:19-23.
     NOTE.—John himself interpreted the prophecy made by Isaiah con-
cerning his work. Questioned by the agents of the priests concerning
his identity, he said, "I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness
. . . as said the prophet Esaias." John's specific work was to prepare
the way for the Messiah, the Deliverer. His appearance and message
could and should have made Israel ready to welcome the long-looked-for
Redeemer, had not their hearts been blinded by national and religious
pride and hedged about by their own traditions and superstitions.
     12. How clearly is the humble, lowly position of the expected Mes-
siah presented? Zech. 9:9.
      NOTE.—See the fulfillment—Matt 21 :1-5.
     13. By what other name is the Redeemer called by Isaiah? Isa. 42:1-4.
     14. What prophecy was made of His public ministry? Under what
conditions was it fulfilled? Isa. 61:1.
      NOTE.—See the fulfillment—Luke 4:16-18, 21.
      15.,By what names does the prophet Jeremiah call the expected De-
liverer? Jer. 23:5, 6.
      NoTE.—Christ is variously referred to in Old Testament scriptures,
 familiar to the Jewish people, as the Anointed, the Angel of His Pres-
 ence, the Branch, the Captain of the Lord's host, Counselor, the Desire
 of all nations, Emmanuel, Mine Elect, the Everlasting Father, the Holy
 One, King over all the earth, Light of the Gentiles, the Lord of hosts,
 and other titles too numerous to record here. Constant reference is made
 to His life and work, the record of which, had Israel been willing to
 learn, should have prepared them fully for the Saviour's appearing.
      16. What prophecy comprehensively relates the circumstances of His
 rejection, sufferings, and death? Isa. 53:1-9.
      NoTE.—"The steadfast among the Jewish nation, descendants of
 that holy line through whom a knowledge of God had been preserved,
 strengthened their faith by dwelling on these and similar passages. With
 exceeding joy they read how the Lord would anoint One `to preach good
 tidings unto the meek,' to bind up the broken-hearted. to proclaim liberty
 to the captives,' and to declare 'the acceptable year of the Lord.' Yet
                                    1331
their hearts were filled with sadness as they thought of the sufferings
He must entlure in order to fulfill the divine purpose. With deep hu-
miliation of soul they traced the words in the prophetic roll (Isa. 53:
1-9) ."—Id., pp. 689, 690
    17. In what manner does the psalmist describe the events clustering
about His resurrection? Ps. 68:18.
    IS. How does the apostle Paul interpret this prophecy? Eph. 4:
8.1(1
                       MEDITATION TOPICS
   1 God may clearly reveal His plans and purposes for man, and still
the selfish desires of men may foil the divine purpose for them. Am I
blinded by my own plans, from seeing God's plan for me?
    2 Suffering, sacrifice, and infinite toil were part of the Saviour's
expected lot. Can we expect ours to be free from these things?
    3. The Deliverer came to save Israel. Few among them acknowledged
or accepted Him. Have you personally made Him your Saviour?



                Lesson 12—September 20, 1930

            The Messiah That Was to Come
MEMORY VERSE: Acts 10:38.
                            INTRODUCTION
   "'Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of Me,) to do
Thy will, 0 God.' In these words is announced the fulfillment of the
purpose that had been hidden from eternal ages. Christ was about to
visit our world, and to become incarnate. He says, 'A body hast Thou
prepared Me.' Had He appeared with the glory that was His with the
Father before the world was, we could not have endured the light of His
presence. That we might behold it and not be destroyed, the manifes-
tation of His glory was shrouded. His divinity was veiled with human-
ity,—the invisible glory in the visible human form."
    "It was Satan's purpose to bring about an eternal separation be-
tween God and man; but in Christ we become more closely united to God
than if we had never fallen. In taking our nature, the Saviour has bound
Himself to humanity by a tie that is never to be broken. Through the
eternal ages He is linked with us."—"The Desire of Ages," pp. 23, 25.
                          THE LESSON
  1. Who announced to Joseph the expected birth of the Redeemer?
What prophecy was thus fulfilled? Matt. 1:20-23; Isa. 7:14.
  2. What was to be the special work of Jesus at His first appearing?
Matt. 1:21.
   3. To whom was His imminent birth revealed?
                             [34]
   Answer: Mary, Luke 1 :35 ; Joseph, Matt. 1:20, 21; Elisabeth, Luke
1:41-43.
   4. At His birth to how large a circle was His coming made known?
Luke 2:8-18; Matt. 2:1, 2.
    5. To whom was His,identity made known soon after His birth?
    Answer: Simeon, Luke 2:25-32; Anna, Luke 2:36-38.
    NOTE.—Not only was opportunity given to the persons mentioned in
the foregoing questions to know that Jesus was to come, but there was
ample opportunity for the priests and rulers both to know He was about
to appear and to recognize and receive Him when He came, had they been
ready to receive Him.
    (a) They had the same prophetic books as did Simeon and Anna:
These gave details of the time, place, and circumstances of His birth.
    (b) Angels revealed His birth to the shepherds, who heralded it
everywhere.
    (c) The wise men, from a study of,Scripture, knew and recognized
His star. They came to Jerusalem, consulted with the king, chief priests,
and scribes, and having worshiped Him, carried the story back to the
East. All these Jewish leaders knew of His birth, and should have re-
ceived Him.
    6. What is said of Christ's childhood and youth on earth? Luke 2:
40, 51, 52.
    NOTE.—"As He grew in wisdom and stature, Jesus increased in fa-
vor with God and man. He drew the sympathy of all hearts by showing
Himself capable of sympathizing with all. The atmosphere of hope and
courage that surrounded Him made Him a blessing in every home. . . .
His quiet and simple life, and even the silence of the Scriptures con-
cerning His early years, teach an important lesson. The more quiet and
simple the life of the hild,—the more free from artificial excitement,
and the more in harmony with nature,—the more favorable is it to
physical and mental vigor and to spiritual strength."—"The Desire of
Ages," p. 74.
   7. How old was Jesus at His baptism? When did He begin His
ministry? Matt. 3:13-17; Mark 1:14; Luke 3:23.
    8. What was the burden of Christ's message for the people? Matt.
4:17.
    NOTE.—Prom the very beginning of His ministry Christ began to
preach repentance and reformation of life in preparation for the com-
ing of His kingdom. By precept and example He sought to prepare men
for a place in the eternal kingdom of glory. His own appearance among
men, His life and ministry in their behalf, were an earnest of the com-
plete fulfillment of God's promises concerning the establishment of the
kingdom. The same message that our Saviour preached He has com-
mitted to men to-day. It is to be a message of repentance, of reforma-
tion, of Christian living, of preparation in body and spirit for the king-
dom of heaven, which is, in the words of the Master, "even at the doors."
                                   [ 35]
      9. In His ministry, what work are we specifically told that He con-
 stantly did? Matt. 4:23; Acts 10:38.
     NOTE.—"Our Lord Jesus Christ came to this world as the unwearied
 servant of man's necessity. He 'took our infirmities, and bare our sick-
 nesses' that He might minister to every need of humanity. The burden
 of disease and wretchedness and sin He came to remove. It was His
 mission to brine to men complete restoration; He came to give them
 health and peace and perfection of character. Varied were the circum-
 stances and needs of those who besought His aid, and none who came
 to Him went away unhelped. From Him flowed a stream of healing
 power, and in bods and mind and soul men were made whole."—"Min-
 istry of Healing," p. 17.
     10. What did Jesus instruct His disciples to teach? What were they
 to do? Matt. 10!7, 8.
     11. What was Christ's attitude toward those who followed Him?
John 13:1; 14:21; 17:26.
     12. Although Christ was deserted even by His disciples at the time
of His betrayal, how was His love demonstrated? Matt. 26:56, 75;
John 19:25-27.
     NOTE.—Although Peter's denial was foreseen by the Saviour, He
did not upbraid His disciple. The warning given to the self-assertive
Peter in love came home to his heart at the second crowing of the cock,
and Peter went forth to weep in bitterness of soul, but to love his Lord
the more. To John was committed the care of the Saviour's mother.
Christ knew the human weaknesses of each of His disciples, but His
love for them never faltered even in those dark hours when they all for-
sook Him and fled. He could trust His mother to His disciple.
     13. What promise concerning His continued presence did He make to
His disciples while still with them? John 16:7, 13.
     14. What conditions are essential to the presence of Christ in our
hearts and lives? John 14:21.
     NOTE.—The outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost
was a definite fulfillment of Christ's promise. It was the early rain
promised to the church by the prophet Joel. Joel 2:23. The latter rain,
to fall just before the gathering of the harvest, was to precede the com-
ing of the Saviour in glory. The operation of the Spirit during the
centuries since the Lord's ascension is a definite and direct fulfillment
of the Saviour's promise to send the Spirit to guide, to comfort, to
establish, and to lead into all truth. John 14:15-17; 16:7-13.
     15. What is the purpose of this continued infilling with spiritual
power? Matt. 28:18-20.
     NOTE.—Not alone does the Saviour promise to send the Comforter.
The Holy Spirit, operating on the hearts of men, is to prepare them
for His second appearing. Sin is to be eradicated, lives are to be trans-
formed. But this is to be preparatory to the fulfilling of that greater
hope, the personal return of our Lord, and the establishment of His
everlasting kingdom.

                        MEDITATION TOPICS
    1. Christ's life on earth was one of humble service, from His manger
birth to Calvary. Do I have the same spirit of humility?
    2. Signs of Christ's Messiahship were in every event of His life—
yet He was rejected for the lack of a sign. He has given to the world
signs of His appearing in this generation, but the world scoffs. Do I
believe or do I doubt?
    3. Would I in the hour of trial forsake Him and flee/ My life day
by day answers this question.


                Lesson 13—September 27, 193 0

             The Hope of His People Israel
MEMORY VERSE: Titus 2:13.
LESSON HELP: "Prophets and Kings," pp. 722-733.

                           INTRODUCTION
    All the experiences of ancient Israel, as recorded in the Sacred
Scriptures, were written for a definite purpose. They are living lessons,
written for all time and full of meaning to all people. God's promises,
given to His ancient people, told not only of the coming of a Redeemer,
His life, His sufferings, His death, and His ascension, but also of His
second appearing for the establishment of the kingdom of glory, in
which the true and tried would dwell eternally. Jesus the Saviour, so
long expected, came, but His own received Him not. Some, a few among
them, accepted Him, and through them He drew many to acknowledge
Him, and receive Him into their hearts. While still on earth, He defi-
nitely outlined the plans laid for His second appearing, lodging in the
hearts of men the hope of His glorious appearing a second time for the
eternal redemption of His people, and of the sin-cursed earth. These
promises and this blessed hope are the background of this final study
on "The Hope of His People Israel."
                             THE LESSON
    1. In the days of Bing David, what promise did God make to him
concerning the establishment of his house? 2 Sam. 7:12, 13.
    NomE.—"The prophet certainly speaks of the coming of a Personage,
David's Son, who will be established on David's throne, or His kingdom,
'forever.' This has never been fulfilled, and will not be until Jesus
comes into His everlasting kingdom, when He, as the true Master builder,
shall complete the Lord's house."—"The Return of Jesus," p. 84.
   2. How does the psalmist describe the coming of Christ in glory?
At that time who does he say will be gathered? Ps. 50:3-6.
   3. How does the prophet Isaiah say the Lord will deal with the earth
and transgressors at His coming? Isa. 13:6, 9.
                                1371
    4. What will be the lot of the ransomed in that hour? How will they
express the feelings of their hearts? Isa. 35:4, 10.
    Noma.—While the coming of the day of God and the appearing of
Jesus in the clouds will be a day of bitter anguish, and sinners will be
destroyedby_the brightness of. His coming, the righteous will rejoice
at His appearing. Isa. 25:9. To the righteous He will come with recom-
pense, to save. They will find in His appearing the fulfillment of a
long-held hope. To them will be joy and gladness, and sorrow and sigh-
ing will flee away.
    5. In what prophetic words does Ezekiel tell of the overturning of
the throne of David, "whose right it is"? Eze. 21:25-27.
    6. How definitely does Daniel tell us the time of the setting up of
of Christ's kingdom? Dan. 2:44.
    7. What events does the prophet state will cluster about the second
Christ's kingdom? Dan. 2:44.
    8. While on earth, what was the outstanding hope implanted in the
hearts of His followers by the Saviour? John 14:1-3.
    NOTE.—The blessed hope of His return was often emphasized by the
Saviour. About nothing was He more positive than concerning His
coming again to gather His people, more certain than of the reality of
the home He was preparing, more definite than of His desire to have the
disciples where He was.
    9. How did Christ seek to impress upon His disciples the certainty of
His second appearing? Matthew 24.
    NOTE.—That none should be deceived, none tempted to be doubtful
and unbelieving, our Saviour carefully outlined to the disciples in an-
swer to their questions (verse 3) events which would precede the fall of
Jerusalem and also be signs of Christ's second appearing. Wars, famine,
pestilence, earthquake, the long years of papal persecution, signs in
sun and moon and stars, false Christs' and false prophets, social con-
ditions paralleling the days of Noah, the shaking of the powers of
heaven, and then the sign of the Son of man in heaven, these were the
signposts that would mark the way. "When ye shall see all these things,
know that it ["He," margin] is near, even at the doors." Not only did
Christ promise, but gave with certainty the evidences of its eminent
fulfillment.
    10. What evidence have we of the Father's interest in making known
Christ's certain return to His children? Acts 1:10, 11.
    11. In writing to the church at Thessalonica, what definite picture
of the events compassing Christ's return does the apostle Paul make?
1 Thess. 4:13-17.
    12. In his letter to Titus, how does Paul speak of Christ's second
coming? Titus 2:13.
    13. To how many will the coming of the Saviour be a source of hap-
piness? Heb. 9:28.
                                   E38 ]
    14. How does Peter describe the day of Christ's second appearing?
2 Peter 3:9, 10.
    15. Following the message of the third angel in Revelation fourteen,
how is the coming of the Saviour portrayed? Rev. 14:14-16.
    16. After viewing the descent of the holy city and the glorious con-
dition of the new earth, how does John voice the heart longings of those
who "love His appearing"? Rev. 22:20.
    NOTE.-With the beloved apostle every soul that truly loves the Lord
Jesus will with all his heart respond to each evidence of the nearness of
our Lord's return, "Even so, come, Lord Jesus." It should be the inspira-
tion of every act of life, the comfort of every hour of depression, the
glorious consummation of all life's plans and purposes. To the Christian
it should be the one thing most of all desired. "It cloth not yet appear
what we shall be: but we know that, when He shall appear, we shall
be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is." 1 John 3:2.
                          MEDITATION TOPICS
    1. Two classes look forward to Christ's return; one with foreboding,
one with joy. What is my heart's response to the thought of His return?
    2. Are the evidences of His coming growing more definite, or do I
put off the day of His appearing, blinding my eyes to the signs displayed?
    3. Am I so ordering my life that I may be found of Him "in peace,
without spot, and blameless"?
