   1. Paul's statement in Rom. 3: 28, that we are "justi-
fied by faith without the deeds of the law," does not exclude
"work of faith, and labor of love" as a part of Christian expe-
rience and duty. 1 Thess. 1: 3. Any work done to gain the
favor of .God is in vain; but love always constrains to ac-
ceptable service.
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    3

    2. We are saved by grace through faith, This saving
grace is entirely a gift of God. Every one may ask God for
this gift and receive it.
    "You have confessed your sins, and in heart put them
away. You have resolved to give yourself to God. Now go to
Him, and ask that He will wash away your sins, and give
you a new heal t. Then believe that He does this because He
has promised. This is the lesson which Jesus taught while
He was on earth, that the gift which God promises us, we must
believe we do receive, and it is ours."—"Steps to Christ," pp.
53, 54, latest edition.
    3. "From the simple Bible account of how Jesus healed
the sick, we may learn something about how to believe in Him
for the forgiveness of sins. Let us turn to the story of the
paralytic at Bethesda. The poor sufferer was helpless; he had
not used his limbs for thirty-eight years. Yet Jesus bade him,
`Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.' The sick .man might have
said, 'Lord, if Thou wilt make me whole, I will obey Thy
word.' But no, he believed Christ's word, believed that he was
made whole, and he made the effort at once; he willed to walk,
and he did walk. He acted on the word of Christ, and. God
gave the power. He was made whole.”— Id., p. 54.
     4. "In like manner you are a sinner. You can not atone
for your past sins, you can not change your heart, and make
yourself holy. But God promises to do all this for you through
Christ. You believe that promise. You confess your sins, and
give yourself to God. You will to serve Him. Just as surely
as you do this, God will fulfill His word to you. If you be-
lieve the promise,— believe that you are forgiven and
cleansed,— God supplies the fact; you are made whole, just as
Christ gave the paralytic power to walk when the man be-
lieved that he was healed. It is so if you believe it.
     "Do not wait to feel that you are made whole, but say, 'I
believe it; it is so, not because I feel it, but because God has
promised.' "— Id., p. 55.
     5. "Jesus says, 'What things soever ye desire, when ye
pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.'
There is a condition to this promise,— that we pray according
to the will of God. But it is the will of God to cleanse us from
sin, to make us His children, and to enable us to live 'a holy
life. So we may ask for these blessings, and believe that we
 receive them, and thank God that we have received them. It
 is our privilege to go to Jesus and be cleansed, and to stand
 before the law without shame or remorse. 'There is there-
 fore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus,
 who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.' . . .
     "Some seem to feel that they must be on probation, and
 must prove to the Lord that they are reformed, before they
4             SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

can claim His blessing. But they may claim the blessing of
God even now. They must have His grace, the Spirit of
Christ, to help their infirmities, or they can not resist evil.
Jesus loves to have us come to Him just as we are, sinful,
helpless, dependent. We may come with all our weakness,
our folly, our sinfulness, and fall at His feet in penitence. It
is His glory to encircle us in the arms of His love, and to bind
up our wounds, to cleanse us from all impurity.
    "Here is where thousands fail: they do not believe that
Jesus pardons them personally, individually. They do not
take God at His word. It is the privilege of all who comply
with the conditions to know for themselves that pardon is
freely extended for every sin. Put away the suspicion that
God's promises are not meant for you. They are for every
repentant transgressor. Strength and grace have been pro-
vided through Christ to be brought by ministering angels to
every believing soul. None are so sinful that they can not
find strength, purity, and righteousness in Jesus, ,who died
for them. He is waiting to strip them of their garments
stained and polluted with sin, and to put upon them the white
robes of righteousness; He bids them live, and not die."—
Id., pp. 55-57.

                               Notes
    1. All have sinned; and apart from the gospel, there is no
hope for any sinner to escape the penalty of sin, which is
death. But Christ has abolished, not the law (Matt. 5: 17-19),
but death (2 Tim. 1: 10), and has brought life and immor-
tality to light through the gospel.
    2. "The law requires righteousness,- a righteous life, a
perfect character; and this man has not to give. He can not
meet the claims of God's holy law. But Christ, coming 10. thia
earth as man, lived a holy life, and developed a perfect char-
acter. These He offers as a free gift to all who will receive
them. His life stands for the life of men. Thus they have
remission of sins that are past, 'through the forbearance of
God. More than this, Christ imbues men with the attributes
of God. He builds up the human character after the simili-
tude of the divine character, a goodly fabric of spiritual
strength and beauty. Thus the very righteousness of the, law
is fulfilled in the believer in Christ. God can 'be just, and. the
justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.' ""The Desire of
Ages," p. 762.
    3. "By the obedience of one shall Many be made righteous."
Rom. 5: 19. Christ kept the law, and thereby demonstrated
6               SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

 that it was possible for man to obey God. But His life was
 more than merely a demonstration of the possibility of keep-
 ing the law. After having lived a life of obedience, He offers
 the righteousness of that life to anyone who will receive it
  (Rom. 4: 24) ; "that the life also of Jesus might be made
 manifest in our body" (2 Cor. 4: 10), and that thus "we might
 be made the righteousness of God in Him" (2 Cor. 5: 21).
     4. Christ was made sin for us, and we have been made
 righteousness in Him. As verily as Christ was made sin, so
 verily have we been made not only righteousness, but the
 righteousness of God in Him. What an exchange!
     "Christ was treated as we deserve, that we might be
 treated as He deserves. He was condemned for our sins, in
'which He had no share, that we might be justified by His
 righteousness, in which we had no share. He suffered the
 death which was ours, that we might receive the life which
 was His. 'With His stripes we are healed.!"—"The Desire
 of Ages," p. 25.
    "More than ',this, Christ changes the heart, He abides in
 your heart by faith. You are to maintain this connection with
 Christ by faith and the continual surrender of your will to
 Him; and so long as you do this, He will work in you to will
 and to do according to His good pleasure."--"Steps to Christ,"
 pp. 67, 68.
    5. The promise that they "shall reign in life" does not
 refer to the future life only. The one who accepts God's
 righteousness by faith will now have victory over sin and evil,
 and the future life will be merely a fuller revelation of this.

      Eph. 6: 1, 2.
18. What promise is given to the willing and obedient? Isa.
      1: 19.
                            Notes
   1. "The tempter thought to take advantage of Christ's
humanity, and urge Him to presumption. But while Satan
can solicit, he can not compel to sin. He said to Jesus, 'Cast
Thyself down,' knowing that he could not cast Him down; for
God would interpose to deliver Him. Nor could Satan force
Jesus to cast Himself down. Unless Christ should consent to
temptation, He could not be overcome. Not all the power of
earth or hell could force Him in the slightest degree to de-
part' from the will of His Father."-"The Desire of Ages,"
p. 125.
    "The foe who in the wilderness had confronted Christ,
assailed Him now with fierce and subtle temptations. Had
Jesus yielded for a moment, had He changed His course in
the least particular to save Himself, Satan's agencies would
8              SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

have triumphed, and the world would have been lost."—
Id., p. 486.
     2. The only obedience worth while is that which comes
 from the heart. Obedience prompted by .fear is slavery.
 Obedience prompted by love is liberty. "The exercise of force
 is contrary to the principles of God's government; He desires
 only the service of love;.and love can not be commanded; it
'can not be won by force or authority. Only by love is love
 awakened. To know God is to love Him; His character must
 be manifested in contrast to the character of Satan. This
 work only one Being in all the universe could do. Only He
 who knew the height and depth of the love of God, could make
 it known. Upon the world's dark night the Sun of Righteous-
 ness must rise, 'with healing in His wings.' "—Id., p. 22.
     "All true obedience comes from the heart. It was heart-
 work. with Christ. And if we consent, He will so identify
 Himself with our thoughts and aims, so blend our hearts and
 minds into conformity to His will, that when obeying Him we
 shall be but carrying out our own impulses. The will, refined
 and sanctified, will find its highest delight in doing His service.
 When we know God as it is our privilege to know Him, our
 life will be a life of continual obedience. Through an appre-
 ciation of the character of Christ, through communion with
 God, sin will become hateful to us."— Id., p. 668.
     3. "The Lord has said, 'Verily My Sabbaths ye shall keep:
 for it is a sign between Me and you throughout your genera-
 tions.' Ex. 31: 13. None should disobey His command in
 order to escape persecution. But let all consider the words of
 Christ, 'When they persecute you in this city, flee ye into
 another.' Matt. 10: 23. If it can be avoided, do not put
 yourselves into the power of men who are worked by the
 spirit of Antichrist. Everything that we can do should be
 done that those who are willing to suffer for the truth's sake
 may be saved from oppression and cruelty.
     "Christ is our example. The determination of Antichrist
 to carry out the rebellion he began in heaven will continue to
 work in the children of disobedience. Their envy and hatred
 against those who obey the fourth commandment, will wax
 more and more bitter. But the people of God are not to hide
 their banner. They are not to ignore the commandments of
 God, and, in order to have an easy time, go with the multi-
 tude to do evil.
     "The Lord encourages all who seek Him with the whole
 heart. He gives them His Holy Spirit, the manifestation of
  His presence and favor. But those who forsake God in order
 to save their lives, will be forsaken by Him. In seeking to
 save their lives by yielding the truth, they will lose eternal
 life."—"Testimonies," vol. 9, p. 230.
              SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                              9

    "The Sabbath is the Lord's test, and no man, be he king,
priest, or ruler, is authorized to come between God and man.
ThoSe who seek to be conscience for their fellow men, place
themselves above God. Those who are under the influence of
a false religion, who obserVe a spurious rest day, will set aside
the most positive evidence in regard to the true Sabbath.
They will try to compel men to obey the laws of their own
creation, laws that are directly opposed to the 'law of God.
Upon those who continue in this course, the wrath of God will
fall. Unless they change, they can not escape the penalty."-
Id., pp. 234, 235.

  16. How is this principle further enunciated? Rom. 10: 10.
  17. Repeat God's promise to them that are of a broken heart.
        Ps. 34: 18.
                             Notes
    1. "Confession will not be acceptable to God without sin-
cere repentance and reformation. There must be decided
changes in the life; everything offensive to God must be put
away. This will be the result of genuine sorrow for sin. The
work that we have to do on our part is plainly set before us:
`Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings
from beforle Mine eyes; cease to do evil; learn tb do well; seek
judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead
for the widow.' Isa. 1 : 16, 17. 'If the wicked restore the
pledge, give again that he had robbed, walk in the statutes
of .life, without committing iniquity; he shall surely live, he
shall not die.' Eze. 33: 15. Paul says, speaking of the work
of repentance: 'Ye sorrowed after a godly sort; what care-
fulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves,
yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement de-
sire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge! In all things ye have
approved yourselves to be clear in this matter.' 2 Cor. 7: 11."
—"Steps to Christ," p. 41b.
    2. "In the days of Samuel, the Israelites wandered from
God. They were suffering the consequences of sin; for they
had lost their faith in God, lost their discernment of His
power and wisdom to rule the nation, lost their confidence in
His ability to defend and vindicate His cause. They turned
from the great Ruler of the universe, and desired to be gov-
erned as were the nations around them. Before they found
peace, they made this definite confession: 'We have added
unto all our sins this evil, to ask us a king.' The very sin of
which they were convicted had to be confessed. Their in-
gratitude oppressed their souls, and severed them from
God."—Ibid.
             SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                           11
     3. "True confession is always of a specific character, and
 acknowledges particular sins. They may be of such a nature
 as to be brought before God only, they may be wrongs that
 should be confessed to individuals who have suffered injury
 through them; or they may be of a public character, and
 should then be as publicly confessed. But all confession
 should be definite and to the point, acknowledging the very
 sins of which, you are guilty."- Id., p. 43.
     4. "When sin has deadened the moral perceptions, the
 wrongdoer does not discern. the defects of his character, nor
 realize the enormity of the evil he has committed; and unless
 he yields to the convicting power of the Holy Spirit, he re-
 mains in partial blindness to his sin. His confessions are not
 sincere and in earnest. To every acknowledgment of ,his
 guilt he adds an apology in excuse of his course, declaring
 that if it had not been for certain circumstances, he would
•not have done this or that, for which he is reproved."-
 Id., pp. 44, 45.

                             Notes
    1. God will "abundantly pardon." He will remove our sins
from us as far as the east is from the west, and His mercy is
as high as the heaven is above the earth. These expressions
denote the exceeding willingness of God to forgive and cleanse.
     2. God "delighteth in mercy." This may seem strange to
some who have been taught that God delights in punishing.
But of this the Bible knows nothing. It is a "strange act" for
God to punish (Isa. 28: 21), but in mercy He delights.
     3. "If when our brethren surmise evil, we would go to
them, saying, 'Forgive me if I have done anything to harm
you,' we might break the spell of Satan, and set our brethren
free from their temptations. Do not let anything interpose
between you and your brethren. If there is anything that you
can do by sacrifice to clear away the rubbish of suspicion, do
it. God wants us to love one another as brethren. He wants
us to be pitiful and courteous. He wants us to educate our-
selves to believe that our brethren love us, and to believe that
 Christ loves us. Love begets love.
    "Do we expect to meet our brethren in heaven? If we can
 live with them here in peace and harmony, we could live with
them there. But how could we live with them in heaven if
 we can not live with them here without continual contention
 and strife? Those who are following a course of action that
separates them from their brethren, and brings in discord and
dissension, need a thorough conversion. Our hearts must be
melted and subdued by the love of Christ. We must cherish
-the love that He showed in dying for us on the cross of
                                         •
              SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                              13

 Calvary. We need to draw closer and closer to the Saviour.
 We should be much in prayer, and we must learn to exercise
 faith. We must be more tender-hearted, more pitiful and
courteous. We shall pass through this world but once. Shall
 we not strive to leave on those with whom we associate, the
 impress of the character of Christ?"—"Testimonies," vol. 9,
 pp. 192, 193.
     4. "Christ told them plainly that in attributing the work
 of the Holy Spirit to Satan, they were cutting themselves off
 from the fountain of blessing. Those who had spoken against
 Jesus Himself, not discerning His divine character, might
 receive forgiveness; for through the Holy Spirit they might
 be brought to see their error and repent. Whatever the sin,
 if the soul repents and believes, the guilt is washed away in
 the blood of Christ; but he who rejects the work of the Holy
 Spirit is placing himself where repentance and faith can not
come to him. It is by the Spirit that God works upon the
 heart; when men willfully reject the Spirit, and declare it to
'be from Satan, they cut off the channel by which God can
communicate with them. When the Spirit is finally rejected,
 there is no more that God can do for the soul."—"The Desire
 of Ages," pp. 321, 322.
     "The most common manifestation of the sin against the
 Holy Spirit, is in persistently slighting Heaven's invitation to
 repent. Every step in the rejection of Christ is a step toward
 the rejection of salvation, and toward the sin against the Holy
 Spirit. In rejecting Christ the Jewish people committed the
 unpardonable sin; and by refusing the invitation of mercy,
 we may commit the same error."— Id., p. 324.

18. In making a complete consecration of all to God, how much

       Note 5.
19. What do we need to understand in order to make a com-
       plete surrender to God? Note 6.
                             Notes
   1. To consecrate means to separate, to devote, to set apart,
to dedicate. To present the body a living sacrifice is to con-
secrate it, to dedicate it to the Lord for service. In Old
Testament times, offerings were presented to the Lord to be
put to death, that the blood might be used for atonement. We
are to consecrate our lives to God, to be a living sacrifice, to
be consumed in His service.
    2. We are to glorify God in our body as well as in our
spirit. Chapters 7-10 of 1 Corinthians go into detail by men-
tioning sins committed in the body. 1 Cor. 10:31 is the key-
note to this section. God wants a clean people, a pure people,
a holy people.
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                 15

    3. "Christ shall be magnified . in my body." What a de-
termination! Weak as Paul was bodily, he decided that Christ
should be magnified in his body. Read 2 Cor. 11: 23-30 to see
how God was magnified in Paul's body. He was able to bear
and to suffer as he did, because of his whole-hearted con-
secration.
    4. "To every one who becomes a partaker of His grace, the
Lord appoints a work for others. Individually we are to
stand in our lot and place, saying, 'Here am I; send me.'
Upon the minister of the word, the missionary nurse, the
Christian physician, the individual Christian, whether he be
merchant or farmer, professional man or mechanic,— the
responsibility rests upon all. It is our work to reveal to men
the gospel of their salvation. Every enterprise in which we
engage should be a means to this end. -
    "Those who take up their appointed work will not only be a
blessing to others, but they will themselves be blessed. The
consciousness of duty well done will have a reflex influence
upon their own souls. The despondent will forget their de-
spondency, the weak will become strong, the ignorant intelli-
gent, and all will find an unfailing helper in Him who has
called them."—"The Ministry of Healing," p. 148.
    5. "But what do we give up, when we give all? — A sin-
polluted heart, for Jesus to purify, to cleanse by His own
blood, and to save by His matchless love. And yet men think
it hard to give up all! I am ashamed to hear it spoken of,
ashamed to write it.                               •
    "God does not require us to give up anything that it is
for our best interest to retain. In all that He does, He has
the well-being of His children -in view. Would that all who
have not chosen Christ might realize that He has something
vastly better to offer them than they are seeking for them-
selves. Man is doing the greatest injury and injustice to his
own soul when he thinks and acts contrary to the will of God.
No real joy can be found in the path forbidden by Him who
knows what is best, and who plans for the good of His
creatures. The path of transgression is the path of misery
and destruction."—"Steps to Christ," pp. 50, 51.
    6. "Many are inquiring, 'How am I to make the surrender
of myself to God?' You desire to give yourself to Him, but
 you are weak in moral power, in slavery to doubt, and con-
trolled by the habits of your life of sin. Your promises and
resolutions are like ropes of sand. You can not control your
thoughts, your impulses, your affections. The knowledge of
 your broken promises and forfeited pledges weakens your con-
fidence in your own sincerity, and causes you to feel that God
can not accept you; but you need not despair. What you
need to understand is the true force of the will. This is the
16             SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

governing power in the nature of man, the power of decision,
or of choice. Everything depends on the right action of the
will. The power of choice God has given to men; it is theirs
to exercise. You can not change your heart, you can not of
yourself give to God its affections; but you can choose to
serve Him. You can give Him your will; He will then work
in you to will and to do according to His good pleasure. Thus
your whole nature will be brought under the control of the
Spirit of Christ; your affections will be centered upon Him,
your thoughts will be in harmony with Him."- Id., pp. 51, 52.

19. What promise is given the liberal soul? Prov. 11: 25.
                             Notes
   1. Of all the signs given by Christ, this is perhaps the
most important. There are but very few countries now where
the gospel has not been preached. We are nearing the end,
of all things.
    2. Not all have the same work to do, but all have some
work for which they are responsible. The work is distributed
"to every man according to his several ability." Not all can
preach, but all can do something. "To His servants Christ
commits 'His goods,'— something to be put to use•for Him.
He gives 'to every man his work.' Each has his place in the
eternal plan of heaven. Each is to work in cooperation with
Christ for the salvation of souls. Not more surely is the place
prepared for us in the heavenly mansions than is the special
place designated on earth where we are to work for God."—
"Christ's Object Lessons," pp. 326, 327.
   3. "The special gifts of the Spirit are not the only talents
represented in the parable. It includes all gifts and endow-
ments, whether original or acquired, natural or spiritual. All
are to be employed in Christ's service. In becoming His
disciples, we surrender ourselves to Him with all that we are
and have. These gifts He returns to us purified and ennobled,
to be used for His glory in blessing our fellow men."
— Id., p. 328.
    Among the gifts may be mentioned the mental faculties,
speech, influence, time, health, strength, money, kindly in-
fluences, and affections. "The man who received the one talent
!went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money.' It
wab the one with the smallest gift who left his talent unim-
proved. In this is given a warning to all who feel that the
18           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

smallness of their endowments excuses them from service for
Christ."— Id., p. 355.
   4. We may help to answer this prayer by going into the
vineyard ourselves, encouraging others to go, helping to sup-
port them, and praying for them.
   5. "During His ministry, Jesus devoted more time to heal-
ing the sick than to preaching. *. . . The Saviour made each
work of healing an occasion for implanting divine principles in
the mind and soul. This was the purpose of His work. He
imparted earthly blessings, that He might incline the hearts
of men to receive the gospel of His grace."—"The Ministry
of Healing," pp. 19, 20.

16. What was one cause for division in the early church?
      Acts 20: 29, 30.
17. What are all enjoined to do? 1 Cor. 1 :10.
                              Notes
    1. "That they may be one" was the burden of Christ's
prayer for His disciples. "In order successfully to carry for-
ward the work to which they had been called, these disciples,
differing so widely in natural characteristics, in training; and
in habits of life, needed to come into unity of feeling, thought,
and action. This unity it was Christ's object to secure. To
this end He sought to bring them into unity with Himself.
The burden of His labor for them is expressed in His prayer
to the Father, 'that they all may be one; as Thou, Father, art
in Me, and I in Thee, that they also may be one in Us; . . .
that the world may know that Thou hast sent Me, and hast
loved them, as Thou hast loved Me.' "-"Education," p. 86.
    It is fundamental that in striving for unity with each
other, we should first seek unity with God. Any unity so
called, without God, is not real unity. There would always
come unity between brethren if, when they are separated, each
sought unity with God. In the prayer of Jesus for us, we
have the thought expressed, "That they all may be one; as
Thou, Father, art in Me, and I in Thee, that they also may be
one in Us." Leave out unity with God, and unity with our
brethren can not follow.
    2. "Wonderful statement! The unity that exists between
Christ and His disciples does not destroy the personality of
either. They are one in purpose, in mind, in character, but
20          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

not in person. It is thus that God and Christ are one."—
"Testimonies," vol. 8, p. 269.
    3. "It is not the opposition of the world that endangers us
the most; it is the evil cherished in the hearts of professed
believers that works our most grievous disaster, and most
retards the progress of God's cause. There is no surer way
of weakening our spirituality than by being envious, suspi-
cious of one another, full of faultfinding and evil-surmising.
`This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sen-
sual, devilish. For where envying and strife is, there is
confusion and every evil work. But the wisdom that is from
above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be en-
treated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and
without hypocrisy. And the fruit of righteousness is sown
in peace of them that make peace.' James 3: 15-18."—
Id., pp. 242, 243.
    "Harmony and union existing among men of varied dis-
positions is the strongest witness that can be borne that God
has sent His Son into the world to save sinners.. It is our
privilege to bear this witness. But in order to do this,
we must place ourselves under Christ's command. Our char-
acters must be molded in harmony with His character, our
wills must be surrendered to His will. Then we shall work to-
gether without a thought of collision."— Id., p. 243.
    "Strive earnestly for unity. Pray for it, work for it. It
will bring spiritual health, elevation of thought, nobility of
character; heavenly-mindedness, enabling you to overcome
selfishness arid- evil-surmisings, and to be more than con-
querors through Him that loved you, and gave Himself for
you. Crucify self; esteem others better than yourselves.
Thus you will be brought into oneness with Christ. Before the
heavenly universe, and before the church and the world, you
will bear unmistakable evidence that you are God's sons and
daughters. God will be glorified in the example that you
set. The world needs to see worked out before it the miracle
that biiids the hearts of God's people together in Christian
love."— Id., vol. 9, p. 188.
    4. "In the church of God to-day brotherly love is greatly
lacking. Many of those who profess to love the Saviour neg-
lect to love those who are united with them in Christian
fellowship. We are of the same faith, members of one
family, all children of the same heavenly Father, with the
same blessed hope of immortality. How close and tender
should be the tie that binds us together. The people of the
world are watching us to see if our faith is exerting a sanc-
tifying influence upon our hearts. They are quick to discern
every defect in our lives, every inconsistency in our actions.
              SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                              21

Let us give them no occasion to reproach our faith."- Id.,
vol. 8, p. 242.
    5. To see eye to eye means to have the same opinion, to
look at matters in the same light. This is possible only when
all are guided by the Holy Spirit. When we reach that point,
we have reached the acme in Christian experience.

                               Notes
     1. Some in the Smyrna church were cast into prison that
 they might be tried. It is not stated that they had done some-
 thing wrong, yet Satan would cast some of them into prison.
 God knew of this beforehand, and could have hindered it if
 He had seen fit to do so; but they needed the experience, and
 God permitted it to come to them. This should give us courage.
 Satan will cast some into prison, but it is all a part of God's
 plan. He knows of it beforehand, and as a result of the ex-
 perience, some will receive a crown of life.
     2. Peter gives -as a reason for rejoicing, that we are made
 partakers of Christ's sufferings, and that thus we will also
 have a share in the "exceeding joy" "when His glory shall be
 revealed."
     3. It is only when we ourselves have passed through a
 great sorrow and have been comforted and sustained by God,
 that we are able to be of any great comfort to them that are
 passing through a similar experience. Hence it is necessary
 for us to pass through affliction, that we may have an under-
 standing sympathy for those who sorrow and are distressed,
 and be able to comfort and console them. It is in proportion as
 we ourselves have suffered, that we are able to give comfort.
•Christ became the prince of sufferers, that He might become
 the prince of comforters. Heb. 2: 18. Paul desired to suffer,
 and he rejoiced in his suffering, because he knew that it would
 better fit him to minister to the church. Col. 1: 24.
     4. "Those who accept Christ as their personal Saviour are
 not left as orphans, to bear the trials of life alone. He re-
 ceives them as members of the heavenly family; He bids them
 call His Father their Father. They are His 'little ones,' dear
 to the heart of God, bound to Him by the most tender and
 abiding ties. He has toward them an exceeding tenderness,
 as far surpassing what our father or mother has felt toward
 us in our helples5ness, as the divine is above the human.
     "Of Christ's relation to His people, there is a beautiful
 illustration in the laws given to Israel. When- through poverty
 a Hebrew had been forced to part with his patrimony, and to
 sell himself as a bondservant, the duty of redeeming him and
 his inheritance fell to the one who was nearest of kin. So
              SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                             23

 the work of redeeming us and our inheritance, lost through
 sin, fell- upon Him who is 'near of kin' unto us. It was to
 redeem us that He became our kinsman. Closer than father,
 mother, brother, friend, or lover, is the Lord our Saviour.
 `Fear not,' He says, 'for I have redeemed thee. I have called
 thee by thy name; thou art Mine.' Since thou wast precious
 in My sight, thou hast been honorable, and I have loved thee;
 therefore will I give men for thee, and people for thy life.'"
-"The Desire of Ages," p. 327.

18. How are Christians to possess their souls? Luke 21: 19.
                              Notes
    1. Patience means more than merely accepting without
complaint whatever comes to us. Patience is a positive vir-
 tue, not a negative one. Its real meaning is to endure, to con-
tinue to the end, to keep on. Many give up before the race
is finished. It is "he that endureth to the end" who "shall be
saved." Matt. 10: 22.
    This meaning. of endurance does not exclude the other
meaning,— of keeping sweet under provocation, of not losing
the temper under insult. Christians should always be able
to control both their tongue and their spirit under the great-
est trials. Christ supplies the .strength needed for all
emergencies.
    2. We are told to take the prophets for an example of
suffering and patience. Almost all the prophets' furnish ex-
amples of this. Moses had many afflictions and hardships.
But he did not become discouraged or faint-hearted. He en-
dured to the end. Jeremiah had trials innumerable. He felt
keenly every insult and mockery. But he did not give up.
He persevered. So did Isaiah, and Ezekiel, and Hosea, and
Amos, and all the rest. Against great odds and sometimes
under fierce persecution, they continued steadfast.
    3. Those who endure are counted happy. It is not enough
to begin — we must also finish. Christ is not only the author,
but also the finisher, of our faith. Heb. 12: 2. He is the.
Omega as well as the Alpha. Rev. 1: 8. Christ finished His
work, and He wants us to finish ours: John 17: 4. Paul had
the same wish. Acts 20: 24; 2 Cor. 8: 6.
    James 5: 11 gives a good example of the meaning of the
word "patience." It means more' than merely being sweet
under provocation. It means to endure. Job was not always
sweet. He was sorely tried, and sometimes gave vent to his
feeling in rather sharp words. In the narrow meaning of the •
word, Job may perhaps have failed; but in the larger meaning,
that of enduring, of steadfastness, of courage, he was emi-
nently successful. In the darkest hour, he could say, "I know
that my Redeemer liveth." Job 19: 25.
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  25

    Some of God's dear saints, worn and weary, may at times
give way to words of impatience. Let such know that "the
Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy." While God can
not excuse sin in any way, He knows our frame, that we are
dust. Ps. 103: 14. He looks in tenderness upon all, and
longs to give the power and help needed. And if we continue
steadfast, if we endure, if we possess that, patience included
in the larger meaning of the word, we will be counted happy.
    4. "Life is disciplinary. While in the world, the Christian
will meet with adverse influences. There will be provocations
to test the temper; and it is by meeting these in a right spirit
that the Christian graces are developed. If injuries and in-
sults are meekly borne, if insulting words are responded to by
gentle answers, and oppressive acts by kindness, this is evi-
dence that the Spirit of Christ dwells in the heart, that sap
from the Living Vine is flowing to the branches. We are in
the school of Christ in this life, where we are to learn to be
meek and lowly of heart; and in the day of final accounts we
shall see that all the obstacles we meet, all the hardships and
annoyances that we are called to bear, are practical lessons
in the application of principles of Christian life. If well
endured, they develop the Christlike in the character, and
distinguish the Christian from the worldling."—"Testimo-
nies," vol. 5, p...444.
    Patience naturally follows temperance. Hence the impor-
tance of gaining control over the appetites and passions.
    5. As tribulation works patience, and as the remnant
church is noted for its patience, it follows naturally that the
remnant church will have special trials and tribulations.
    6. Paul says that "the signs of an apostle were wrought
among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty
deeds." Read 2 Cor. 11: 23-27 to see how Paul endured and
bore with patience the ill treatment accorded him.

    "If all who profess to be followers of Christ were truly
sanctified, their means, instead of being spent for needless
and even hurtful indulgences, would be turned into the Lord's
treasury, and Christians would set an example of temperance,
self-denial, and self-sacrifice."—"The Great Controversy,"
P. 475.
    "Professed Christians yearly expend an immense sum
upon useless and pernicious indulgences, while souls are per-
ishing for the word of life."— Id., p. 475.

   "The Sabbath school work is important, and all who are
interested in the truth should endeavor to make it prosper-
ous."—"Testimonies," vol. 5, p. 127.

                              Notes
   1. "While we review, not the dark chapters in our expe-
rience, but the manifestations of God's great mercy and un-
failing love, we shall praise far more than complain. We
shall talk of the loving faithfulness of God, as the true, tender,
compassionate shepherd of His flock, which He has declared
that none shall pluck out of His hand. The language of the
heart will not be selfish murmuring and repining. Praise, like
clear-flowing streams, will come from God's truly believing
ones. 'Goodness and mercy shall follow me all •the days of
my life; and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.'
`Thou shalt guide me with Thy counsel, and afterward receive
me to glory. Whom have I in heaven but Thee? and there is
none upon earth that I desire beside Thee.' Ps. 23: 6; 73: 24,
25."—"Testimonies," vol. 6, pp. 367, 368.
    2. "Those professed Christians who are constantly whin-
ing and complaining, and who seem to think happiness and a
cheerful countenance a sin, have not the genuine article of
religion. Those who look upon nature's beautiful scenery as
they would upon a dead picture, who choose to look upon dead
leaves rather than to gather the beautiful living flowers, who
take a mournful pleasure in all that is melancholy in the
language spoken to them by the natural world, who see no
beauty in valleys clothed with living green and grand moun-
tain heights clothed with verdure, who close their senses to the
joyful voice which speaks to them in nature, and which is
sweet and musical to the listening ear,— these are not in
Christ. They are not walking in the light, but are gathering
to themselves darkness and gloom, when they could just as
well have brightness, and the blessing of the Sun of Right-
eousness arising in their hearts with healing in His beams."
— Id., vol. 3, pp. 334, 335.
    3. "You have imagined that cheerfulness was not in ac-
cordance with the religion of Christ. This is a mistake. We
may have true Christian dignity, and at the same time be
cheerful and pleasant in our deportment. Cheerfulness with-
out levity is one of the Christian graces. You should guard
against taking narrow views of religion, or you will limit your
influence and become an unfaithful steward of God."— Id.,
vol. 4, p. 62.
    "There are those who take to gloom as a bat to darkness
or as a vulture to carrion. They would rather nurse a misery
than cherish a joy. They always find the dark side of every-
thing, if there is a dark side to be found. They appear to be
conscientious grumblers, as if it were their duty to extract
some essence of misery from every circumstance. . . . On
the other hand, there are rare spirits who always take cheer-
28            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

ful views of life. They look at the bright side. They find
some joy and beauty everywhere. . . . In the most faulty
picture, they see some bit of beauty which charms them. In
the most disagreeable person, they discover some kindly trait
or some bud of promise. In the most disheartening circum-
stances, they find something for which to be thankful, some
gleam of cheer breaking through the thick gloom. .
When a ray of sunlight streamed through a crack in the
shutter and made a bright patch on the floor in the darkened
 room, the little dog rose from his dark corner and went and
 lay down in the one sunny spot; and these people live in the
same philosophical way. If there is one beam of cheer or
hope anywhere in their lot, they will find it. . . . We have no
right to project the gloom of our discontent over any other•
life. Our ministry is to be ever toward joy. There is nothing
so depressing in its effects upon others as morbidness. . . .
 Discontent helps nothing. . . . One never feels better•
for complaining."—"Week-Day Religion," by J. R. Miller,
pp. 236-241.
    "How many people," says Jeremy Taylor, "are busy in the
world gathering together a handful of thorns to sit upon."

                             Notes
    1. "The foundation of the plan of salvation was laid in
sacrifice. Jesus left the royal courts, and became poor, that
we through His poverty might be made rich. All who share
thii' salvation, purchased for them at such an infinite sacrifice
by the Son of God, will follow the example of the True Pat-
tern. Christ was the chief corner stone, and we must build
upon this foundation. Each must have a spirit of self-denial
and self-sacrifice."-"Testimonies," vol. 3, p. 387.
    2. "If the plan of systematic benevolence were adopted by
every individual, and fully carried out, there would be a con-
stant supply in the treasury. The income would flow in like
a steady stream constantly supplied by overflowing springs of
benevolence. Almsgiving is a part of gospel religion. Does
not the consideration of the infinite price paid for our re-
demption leave upon us solemn obligations pecuniarily, as well
as lay claim upon all our powers to be devoted to the work
of the Master?"- Id., pp. 389, 390.
    3. "Christians are required by the Scriptures to enter upon
a plan of fictive benevolence which will keep in constant ex-
 30             SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

 ercise an interest in the salvation of their fellow men. The
 moral law enjoined the observance of the Sabbath, which was
 not a burden, except when that law was transgressed and they
 were bound by the penalties involved in breaking it. The
 tithing system was no burde'n to those who did not depart
 from the plan. The system enjoined upon the Hebrews has
 not been repealed or relaxed by the One who originated it.
 Instead of being of no force now, it was to be more fully
 carried out and more extended, as salvation through Christ
 alone should be more fully brought to light in the Christian
 age."—Id., pp. 391, 392.
     "As to the amount required, God has specified one tenth
 of the increase. This is left to the conscience and benevolence
 of men, whose judgment in this tithing system should have
 free play. And while it is left free to the conscience, a plan
 has been laid out definite enough for all. No compulsion is
 required."— Id., p. 394.
     4. "Systematic benevolence should not be made systematic
 compulsion. It is freewill offerings that are acceptable to God.
 True Christian benevolence springs from the principle of
 grateful love. Love to Christ can not exist without corre-
 sponding love to those whom He came into the world to re-
 deem. Love to Christ must be the ruling principle of the
 being, controlling all the emotions and directing all- the
 energies."— Id., p. 396.
     5. "In the balances of the sanctuary, the gifts of the poor,
 made from love to Christ, are not estimated according to the
 amount given, but according to the love which prompts the
 sacrifice. The promises of Jesus will as surely be realized by
 the liberal poor man, who has but little to offer, but who gives
 that little freely, as by the wealthy man who gives of his
 abundance."— Id., pp. 398, 399.
     "The offerings of little children may be acceptable and
 pleasing to God. In accordance with the spirit that prompts
 the gifts will be the value of the offering."— Id., p. 412.

                             Notes
   1. "We should in no case allow burdens and business trans-
actions to divert our minds upon the Sabbath of the Lord,
which He has sanctified. We should not allow our minds to
dwell upon things of a worldly character even."-"Testimo-
vies," vol. 2, p. 583.
   "Some have made a serious mistake in neglecting to attend
the public worship of God. • The privileges of divine service
will be as beneficial to them as to others, and are fully as
essential. They may be unable to avail themselves of these
privileges as often as do many others. Physicians will fre-
quently be called, upon the Sabbath, to visit the sick, and may
be obliged to make it a day of exhausting labor. Such labor
to relieve the suffering, was pronounced by our Saviour a
work of mercy, and no violation of the Sabbath."- Id., vol.
4, P. 539.

    2. "During a portion of the day, all should have an op-
portunity to be out of doors. How can children receive a more
correct knowledge of God, and their minds be better impressed,
than in spending a portion of their time out of doors, not in
play, but in company with their parents? Let their young
minds be associated with God in the beautiful scenery of na-
ture, let their attention be called to the tokens of His love to
man in His created works, and they will be attracted and in-
terested. . . . You can direct their minds to the lovely birds
making the air musical with their happy songs, to the spires of
grass, and the gloriously tinted flowers in their perfection
perfuming the air. All these proclaim the love and skill of
the heavenly Artist, and show forth the glory of God."— Id.,
vol. 2, pp. 583, 584.
    3. "In establishing new churches, ministers should give
careful instruction as to the proper observance of the Sabbath.
We must be guarded, lest the lax practices that prevail among
Sunday keepers shall be followed by those who profess to ob-
serve God's holy rest day. The line of demarcation is to be
made clear and distinct between those who bear the mark of
God's kingdom and those who bear the sign of the kingdom of
rebellion.
    "Far more sacredness is attached to the Sabbath than is
given it by many professed Sabbath keepers. The Lord has
been greatly dishonored by those who have not kept the Sab-
bath according to the commandment, either in the letter or in
the spirit. He calls for a reform in the observance of the
Sabbath."— /d., vol. 6, p. 353.
    "In all that pertains to the success of God's work, the very
first victories are to be won in the home life. Here the prep-
aration for the Sabbath must begin. Throughout the week
let parents remember that their home is to be a school in which
their children shall be prepared for the courts above. Let
their words be right words. No words which their children
should not hear are to escape their lips. Let the spirit be
kept free from irritation. Parents, during the week live as in
the sight of a holy God, who has given you children to train
for Him. Train for Him the little church in your home, that
on the Sabbath all may be prepared to worship in the Lord's
sanctuary. Each morning and evening present your children
to God as His blood-bought heritage. Teach them that it is
their highest duty and privilege to love and serve God."—
Id., p. 354..
