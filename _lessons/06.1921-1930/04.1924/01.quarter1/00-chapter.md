   The Jubilee Year of Our Missions
    As we take up the study of these lessons, we enter
 upon a notable year in our history. Ere the year
closes, we shall have passed the fiftieth year of mis-
sionary history in connection with our denomina-
tional endeavor. It was on September 14, 1874, that
 Elder J. N. Andrews sailed out of Boston harbor
with his face turned toward Europe. He thus be-
came our first foreign missionary, and this event
marked the beginning of all that has followed in
connection with our efforts to carry this message to
all the world.
    These have been years of wonderful events as
they relate to the opening providences of God. Be-
ginning with that single representative, our efforts
in behalf of the world, including the millions of be-
nighted heathen, have grown until there is never a
day passes but that we have outgoing missionaries
traveling on the high seas to take their places in the
front line of battle. We have crossed all the navi-
gable oceans, and thrown our lines of advance across
continents, leaping over geographical boundaries and
obliterating national distinctions, until our work is
being conducted in one hundred and seventy differ-
ent languages.
    Fifty years ago it was a, matter of faith as the
brethren laid hold of the prophecies relating to a
finished work, but now it is a matter of fact.
Achievement upon achievement under the leadership
of God has brought us within reach of a quickly
finished task. Fifty years ago the cause was un-
known, but now its flag is unfurled in almost every
port into which ships sail.
    These fifty years have been years of great bless-
ing, and it is hoped that the lessons which deal in
such a practical way, with the individual relation-
ship to the great mission problem confronting us as
a people will evoke from every heart the kind of
gratitude that will lead us all to participate in a
deeper consecration to the unfinished work. It-will
take all there is of every loyal Seventh-day Ad-
ventist to bring to a successful conclusion the task
so nobly begun. Personal service, means, and every
other heavenly gift must be laid on the altar for
service.

                              Notes
    1. By their transgression, our first parents lost for them-
selves and their posterity the divine image, forfeited their
right to eternal life, and surrendered their charter to the
rulership of this world. The great Missionary came to re-
store everything that had been lost through apostasy; and
His victorious life, death, and resurrection insured the com-
plete success of the glorious enterprise.
    2. Those exceedingly rare instances in which an indi-
vidual dies for his friend, constitute the highest expression of
human love and devotion. To surrender one's life for an
enemy, is divine. "Such love is without a parallel. Children
of the heavenly King! Precious promise! Theme for the
most profound meditation ! The matchless love of God for a
world that did not love Him! The thought has a subduing
power upon the soul, and brings the mind into captivity to
the will of God. The more we study the divine character in
the light of the cross, the more we see mercy, tenderness,
and forgiveness blended with equity and justice, and the more
clearly we discern innumerable evidences of a love that is
infinite, and a tender pity surpassing a mother's yearning sym-
pathy for her wayward child."—"Steps to Christ," pp. 17, 18.
    3. While in this world, He took not upon Him "holy flesh,"
but "sinful flesh." Among the ancestors of Christ as given
in the genealogies of Matthew and Luke were men and women
notorious for their wickedness and dissolute lives. "Jesus
accepted humanity when the race had been weakened by four
thousand years of sin. Like every child of Adam He accepted
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    5

the results of the working of the great law of heredity. What
these results were is shown in the history of His earthly an-
cestors. He came with such a heredity to share our sorrows
and temptations, and to give us the example of a sinless life."
—"The Desire of Ages," p. 48. He thus became one with the
people, and on this level worked out human salvation.
    Note also Paul's manner of labor for the various classes.
1 Cor. 9: 19-22.
    4. "By beholding we become changed;" by viewing the
portrait of Jesus as revealed in the Word, we become "like
Him" in thinking, in working, in doing; by meditation upon
His incomparable sacrifice, we too are impelled to give our
lives in unselfish ministry. But the complete unfolding of
that love will be reserved as the theme and delight of the
saved throughout eternity.
   5. "Christ feels the woes of every sufferer. When evil
spirits rend a human frame, Christ feels the curse. When
fever is burning up the life current, He feels the agony. And
He is just as willing to heal the sick now, as when He was
personally on earth."— Id., p. 823.
   "While as a member of the human family He was mortal,
as God He was the fountain of life for the world. He could
have withstood the advances of death, and refused to come
under its dominion ; but voluntarily He laid down His life,
that He might bring life and immortality to light. He bore the
sin of the world, endured its curse, yielded up His life as a
sacrifice, that men might not eternally die."— Id., pp. 483, 484.
    6. "The Saviour's commission to the disciples included all
the believers. It includes all believers in Christ to the end of
time. It is a fatal mistake to suppose that the work of sav-
ing souls depends alone on the ordained minister. All to
whom the heavenly inspiration has come, are put in trust
with the gospel. All who receive the life of Christ are or-
dained to work for the salvation of their fellow men."
— Id., p. 822.
    7. "The Saviour does not bid the disciples labor to bear
fruit. He tells them to abide in Him. . . . The life of Christ
in you produces the same fruits as in Him. Living in Christ,
adhering to Christ, supported by Christ, drawing nourishment
from Christ, you bear fruit after the similitude of Christ."
— Id., p. 677.

    The Thirteenth Sabbath overflow will go to India in ad-
dition to the appropriation voted to that field. Shall we not.
have a large overflow? India needs it.

                              Notes
    1. "The plan for our redemption was not an afterthought,
a plan formulated after the fall of Adam. It was a revela-
tion of 'the mystery which hath been kept in silence through
times eternal.' It was an unfolding of the principles that
from eternal ages have been the foundation of God's throne.
From the beginning, God and Christ knew of the apostasy of
Satan, and of the fall of man throygh the deceptive power of
the apostate. God did not ordain that sin should exist, but
He foresaw its existence, and made provision to meet the
terrible emergency."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 22.
    2. What a contrast to this is presented by the teachings
of popular theology! In numerous theological seminaries, it
is taught that man is his own savior; that within each of us
there is a spark of divinity, which, if discovered and fanned
into a living flame, will bring to the individual everything that
is desirable. Through this new pantheism, Satan is still say-
ing, "Ye shall be as God." Gen. 3: 5, Revised Version. Note
how this destroys the grand missionary incentive; for with a
conception that man is inherently divine, why should we
hazard our lives and sacrifice our means to save the heathen?
    3. "Since the announcement to the serpent in Eden, 'I will
put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy
seed and her seed,' Satan had known that he did not hold
absolute sway over the world. There was seen in men the
working of a power that withstood his dominion."— Id., p. 115.
This promise to Adam and Eve contained the entire plan for
man's restoration.
    4. Noah, being a "preacher of righteousness." certainly
presented to his hearers the only standard recognized by the
8           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

Scriptures; namely, righteousness through faith in Christ.
Since the record also states that Christ, through the Spirit,
preached, or testified, "in the days of Noah, while the ark
was a preparing," it is evident that this was none other than
the preaching of the gospel, and that the "spirits in prison"
were men and women groaning under the bondage of sin, and
needing a Saviour to set them free. Compare Rom. 11: 32,
margin.
    5. "The Lord condescended to enter into a covenant with
His servant, employing such forms as were customary among
men for the ratification of a solemn engagement. By divine
direction, Abraham sacrificed a heifer, a she-goat, and a ram,
each three years old, dividing the bodies, and laying the pieces
a little distance apart. . . . The plan of redemption was here
opened to him, in the death of Christ, the great sacrifice, and
His coming in glory. Abraham saw also the earth restored
to its Eden beauty, to be given him for an everlasting posses-
sion, as the final and complete fulfillment of the promise.
    "As a pledge of this covenant of God with men, a smoking
furnace and a burning lamp, symbols of the divine presence,
passed between the severed victims, totally consuming them."
—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 137.
    6. "Abraham, 'the friend of God,' set us worthy example.
His was a life of prayer. Wherever he pitched his tent, close
beside it was set up his altar, calling all within his encamp-
ment to the morning and the evening sacrifice. When his
tent was removed, the altar remained. In following years,
there were those among the roving Canaanites who received
instruction from Abraham; and whenever one of these came
to that altar, he knew who had been there before him; and
when he had pitched his tent, he repaired the altar, and there
worshiped the living God."— Id., p. 128.
    7. "The ram offered in the place of Isaac represented the
Son of God, who was to be sacrificed in our stead. . . . When
the command was given to Abraham to offer up his son, the
interest of all heavenly beings was enlisted. With intense
earnestness they watched each step in the fulfillment of this
command. When to Isaac's question, 'Where is the lamb for,
a burnt offering?' Abraham made answer,'God will provide
Himself a lamb;' and when the father's hand was stayed as
he was about to slay his son, and the ram which God had pro-
vided was offered in the place of Isaac,-- then light was shed
upon the mystery of redemption, and even the angels under-
stood more clearly the wonderful provision that God had made
for man's salvation."— Id., pp. 154, 155.

                            Notes
    1. "Through the Jewish nation it was God's purpose to im-
part rich blessings to all peoples. Through Israel the way
was to be prepared for the diffusion of His light to the whole
world. The nations of the world, through following corrupt
practices, had lost the knowledge of God. Yet in His mercy
God did not blot them out of existence. He purposed to give
them opportunity for becoming acquainted with Him through
His church. . . . It was for the accomplishment of this pur-
pose that God called Abraham out from his idolatrous kin-
dred, and bade him dwell in the land of Canaan."—"Christ's
Object Lessons," p. 286.
    2. To give te invitation, "Come," has ever been the great
business of Christ and His followers. We are still "journey-
ing"; soon the heavenly Canaan will be reached; "the Lord
hath spoken good concerning Israel;" and by every available
means, the "good tidings" are to be proclaimed in every land.
"Christ will perform wonderful miracles if men will but do
their God-given part. In human hearts to-day as great a
transformation may be wrought as has ever been wrought in
generations past. John Bunyan was redeemed from pro-
fanity and reveling, John Newton from slave-dealing, to
proclaim an uplifted Saviour. A Bunyan and a Newton may
be redeemed from among men to-day."— Id., p. 236.
    3. The two principal centers of ancient civilization were
the valleys of the Euphrates and Tigris on the one hand, the
home of the Chaldean, Assyrian, and Babylonian monarchies;
on the other hand, the Nile valley, the seat of Egyptian great-
ness. A glance at the map shows the land of Palestine to be
situated between these two centers, along the greatest inter-
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                 11

national highway of antiquity. Here God placed Israel to be
the world's light-bearer.
     4. Had Israel lived up to their high privileges, many be-
lievers would have been raised up to the praise of Jehovah in
Egypt, Assyria, and other lands.
     5. "These prophecies of a great spiritual awakening in a
time of gross darkness, are to-day meeting .fulfillment in the
advancing lines of mission stations that are reaching out into
the benighted regions of earth. The groups of missionaries
in heathen lands have been likened by the prophet to ensigns
set up for the guidance of those who are looking for the light
of truth."—"Prophets and Kings," pp. 375, 376.
     6. Ruth was in the direct line of descent from Abraham to
David and Christ. Matt. 1: 5. The fact' that the house of
David was chosen from a line in which were at least two
streams of alien blood, should have been a great object lesson
to the Israelites, leading them away from their national and
religious exclusiveness, and teaching them that "in every
nation he that feareth Him, and worketh righteousness, is ac-
cepted with Him." Acts' 10: 35. What an incentive, too, it
should have been for the Jews to seek other jewels from among
the heathen!
     7. As Israel failed to send abroad the gosper that saves,
heathenism itself turned upon the chosen people and threat-
ened to engulf them. For all this, " 'the Lord brought Judah
low' because of continued transgression. In this time of chas-
tisement, Ahaz, instead of repenting, trespassed 'yet more
against the Lord: . . . for he sacrificed unto the gods of
 Damascus.' Because the gods of the kings of Syria help
them,' he said, 'therefore will I sacrifice to them, that they
may help me.'
     "As the apostate king neared the end of his reign, he
 caused the doors of the temple to be closed. The sacred
services were interrupted. No longer were the candlesticks
 kept burning before the altar. No longer were offerings made
 for the sins of the people. No longer did sweet incense
 ascend on high at the time of the morning and the evening
 sacrifice. Deserting the courts of the house of God, and lock-
 ing fast its doors, the inhabitants of the godless city boldly
 set up altars for the worship of heathen deities on the street
 corners throughout Jerusalem. Heathenism had seemingly
 triumphed; the powers of darkness had well-nigh prevailed."
 — Id., p. 330.

   "It is impossible to estimate the good results of one hour
or even half an hour each day devoted in a cheerful, social
manner to the word of God."— Mrs. E. G. White, in "Testi-
monies on Sabbath School Work."

                              Notes
    1. "The visit of these messengers from the ruler of a far-
away land gave Hezekiah an opportunity to extol the living
God. How easy it would have been for him to tell them of
God, the upholder of all created things, through whose favor
his own life had been spared when all other hope had fled!
What momentous transformations might have taken place
had these seekers after truth from the plains of Chaldea been
led to acknowledge the supreme sovereignty of the living
God!"—"Prophets and Kings," p. 344.
    2. The king did what any other worldly monarch might
have done under like circumstances; but "had Hezekiah im-
proved the opportunity given him to bear witness to the power,
the goodness, the compassion, of the God of Israel, the report
of the ambassadors would have been as light piercing dark-
ness. But he magnified himself above the Lord of hosts. He
`rendered not again according to the benefit done unto him;
for his heart was lifted up.'       Id., p. 346.
    "The story of Hezekiah's failure to prove true to his trust
at the time of the visit of the ambassadors, is fraught with an
important lesson for all. Far more than we do, we need to
speak of the precious chapters in our experience, of the mercy
and loving-kindness of God, of the matchless depths of the
Saviour's love. When mind and heart are filled with the love
of God, it will not be difficult to impart that which enters into
the spiritual life. Great thoughts, noble aspirations, clear
perceptions of truth, unselfish purposes, yearnings for piety
and holiness, will find expression in words that reveal the
 character of the heart treasure.
14          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

    "Those with whom we associate day by day need our help,
our guidance. They may be in such a condition of mind that
a word spoken in season will be as a nail in a sure place. To-
morrow some of these souls may be where we can never reach
them again. What is our influence over these fellow travel-
ers?"— Id., pp. 347, 348.
    3. God's ideal for Israel is clearly set forth in Isa. 19: 24,
last part. Failure to labor for the lost ever brings spiritual
poverty and ruin. Compare Matt. 25: 26-29.
    "Every day of life is freighted with responsibilities which
we must bear. Every day, our words and acts are making
impressions upon those with whom we associate. How great
the need that we set a watch upon our lips and guard care-
fully our steps! One reckless movement, one imprudent step,
and the surging waves of some strong temptation may sweep
a soul into the downward path. We can not gather up the
thoughts we have planted in human minds. If they have been
evil, we may have set in motion a train of circumsitances, a
tide of evil, which we are powerless to stay.
    "On the other hand, if by our example we aid others in
the development of good principles, we give them power to
do good. In their turn they exert the same beneficial influ-
ence over others. Thus hundreds and thousands are helped
by our unconscious influence. The true follower of Christ
strengthens the good purposes of all with whom he comes in
contact. Before an unbelieving, sin-loving world, he reveals
the power of God's grace and the perfection of His character."
— Id., p. 348.
    4. Kings and priests for God had alike neglected the op-
portunities of enlightening the peoples of the Euphrates
valley. Now He sends His missionaries to Babylon in the
guise of captives. "In the land of their captivity these men
were to carry out God's purpose by giving to heathen nations
the blessings that come through a knowledge of Jehovah.
They were to be His representatives."— Id., p. 479.
    5. "The once proud monarch had become a humble child of
God; the tyrannical, overbearing ruler, a wise and compas-
sionate king. He who had defied and blasphemed the God of
heaven, now acknowledged the power of the Most High, and
earnestly sought to promote the fear of Jehovah and the
happiness of his subjects. Under the rebuke of Him who is
King of kings and Lord of lords, Nebuchadnezzar had learned
at last the lesson which all rulers need to learn,— that true
greatness consists in true goodness."— Id., p. 591.
     6. "Just at the time God had said He would cause His
temple at Jerusalem to be rebuilt, He moved upon Cyrus as
His agent to discern the prophecies concerning himself, with
which Daniel was so familiar, and to grant the Jewish people
their liberty.
             SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                            15

    "As the king saw the words foretelling, more than a
hundred years before his birth, the manner in which Babylon
should be taken; as he read the message addressed to him by
the Ruler of the universe,       girded thee, though thou hast
not known Me: that they may know from the rising of the
sun, and from the west, that there is none beside Me;' as he
saw before his eyes the declaration of the eternal God, Tor
Jacob My servant's sake, and Israel Mine elect, I have even
called thee by thy name: I have surnamed thee, though thou
hast not known Me;' as he traced the inspired record, 'I have
raised him up in righteousness, and I will direct all his ways:
he shall build My city, and he shall let go My captives, not
for price nor reward,' his heart was profoundly moved, and he
determined to fulfill his divinely appointed mission."— Id.,
p. 557.
    7. So long had Jewish zeal been centered upon hoarding
for itself the blessings of heaven, so long had Hebrew piety
devoted itself to the ceremony and letter of a lifeless creed,
that even the thought of true missionary labor for the Gen-
tiles filled their hearts with nameless rage.
    8. This prophecy was fulfilled in A. D. 70, at which time
Jerusalem was destroyed by the Romans. More than.a mil-
lion Jews perished in the siege of the devoted city, and multi-
tudes of others were sold into slavery. Thus terminated
Jewish national life, the history of which furnishes the great-
est object lesson of the ages in the outworking of the spiritual
— as also the natural — axiom, "Use and improve, or lose."

                           Notes
   1. "The Jewish people had been made the depositaries of
sacred truth; but Pharisaism had made them the most ex-
clusive, the most bigoted of all the human race. Everything
about the priests and rulers,- their dress, customs, cere-
monies, traditions,- made them unfit to be the light of the
world. They looked upon themselves, the Jewish nation, 'as
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    17

the world. But Christ commissioned His disciples to proclaim
a faith and worship that would have in it nothing of caste or
country, a faith that would be adapted to all peoples, all na-
tions, all classes of men."—"The Desire of Ages," pp. 819, 820.
     2. "The Holy Spirit was the highest of all gifts that He
could solicit from His Father for the exaltation of His peo-
ple. . . . Sin could be resisted and overcome only through
the mighty agency of the third person of the Godhead, who
would come with no modified energy, but in the fullness of
divine power. It is the Spirit that makes effectual what has
been wrought out by the world's Redeemer. It is by the
Spirit that the heart is made pure. Through the Spirit the
believer becomes a partaker of the divine nature. Christ has
given His Spirit as a divine power to overcome all hereditary
and cultivated tendencies to evil, and to impress His own
character upon His church."— Id., p. 671.
      3. "The disciples prayed with intense earnestness for a
fitness to meet men, and in their daily intercourse to speak
words that would lead sinners to Christ. Putting away all
differences, all desire for the supremacy, they came close to-
gether in Christian fellowship. . . .
      "These days of preparation were days of deep heart-
searching. The disciples felt their spiritual need, and cried
to the Lord for the holy unction that was to fit them for the
work of soul-saving. They did not ask for a blessing for them-
selves merely. They were weighted with the burden of the
salvation of souls. They realized that the gospel was to be
carried to the world, and they claimed the power that Christ
had promised."—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 37.
      4. "The lapse of time has wrought no change in Christ's
parting promise to send the Holy Spirit as His representative.
 It is not because of any restriction on the part of God that the
 riches of His grace do not flow earthward to men. If the ful-
 fillment of the promise is not seen as it might be, it is because,
 the promise is not appreciated as it should be. If all were
 willing, all would be filled with the Spirit. Wherever the
 need of the Holy Spirit is a matter little thought of, there
 is seen spiritual drought, spiritual darkness, spiritual de-
 clension and death."— Id., p. 50.
      5.' "Pentecost brought them the heavenly illumination.
 . . . With what burning language they clothed their ideas as
 they bore witness for. Him! Their hearts were surcharged
 with a benevolence so full, so deep, so far-reaching, that it
 impelled them to go to the ends of the earth, testifying to
 the power of Christ. They were filled with an intense long-
 ing to carry forward the work He had begun. They realized
 the greatness of their debt to heaven, and the responsibility
 of their work. Strengthened by the endowment of the Holy
 Spirit, they went forth filled with zeal to extend the triumphs
18            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

of the cross. The Spirit animated them and spoke through
them. The peace of Christ shone from their faces. They had
consecrated their lives to Him for service, and their very
features bore evidence to the surrender they had made."—
Id., pp. .45, 46.
    6. "Learning, talents, eloquence, every natural or ac-
quired endowment, may be possessed; but without the pres-
ence of the Spirit of God, no heart will be touched, no sinner
be won to Christ. On the other hand, if they are connected
with Christ, if the gifts of the Spirit are theirs, the poorest
and most ignorant of His disciples will have a power that will
tell upon hearts."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 328.
    7. "The order that was maintained in the early Christian
church, made it possible for them to move 'forward solidly, as a
well-disciplined army, clad with the armor of God. The com-
panies of believers, though scattered over a large territory,
were all members of one body; all moved in concert, and in
harmony with one another."—"The Acts of the Apostles,"
pp. 95, 96.
                                                                   •

                             Notes
    1. "In the cruel faces about him, the prisoner [Stephen]
read his fate; but he did not waver. For him the fear of
death was gone. For him the enraged priests and the ex-
cited mob had no terror. The scene before him faded from
his vision. To him, the gates of heaven were ajar, and look-
ing in, he saw the glory of the courts of God, and Christ, as
if just risen from His throne, standing ready to sustain His
servant."-"The Acts of the Apostles," pp. 100, 101.
    2. "Not to the early church only, but to all future genera-
tions, this example of God's hatred of covetousness, fraud,
and hypocrisy, was given as a danger-signal. . . . God has
20         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

made the proclamation of the gospel dependent upon the
labors and the gifts of His people. Voluntary offerings and
the tithe constitute the revenue of the Lord's work. Of the
means entrusted to man, God claims a certain portion,— the
tenth. He leaves all free to say whether or not they will give
more than this. But when the heart is stirred by the influence
of the Holy Spirit, and a vow is made to give a certain amdunt,
the one who vows has no longer any right to the consecrated
portion."— Id., p. 74.
    3. "The Spirit is to use us. Through the Spirit God works
in His people 'to will and to do of His good pleasure.' But
many will not submit to this. They want to manage them-
selves. This is why they do not receive the heavenly gift.
Only to those who wait humbly upon God, who watch for His
guidance and grace, is the Spirit given. The power of God
awaits their demand and reception. This promised blessing,
claimed by faith, brings all other blessings in its train."
"The Desire of Ages," p. 672.
    4. "When properly conducted, the health work is an en-
tering wedge, making a way for other truths to reach the
heart. When the third angel's message is received in its full-
ness, health reform will be given its place in the councils of
the conference, in the work of the church, in the home, at the
table, and in all the household arrangements. Then the right
arm will serve and protect the body."—"Testimonies," vol.
6, p. 327.
    5. "In causing the destruction of the swine, it was Satan's
purpose to turn the people away from the Saviour, and pre-
vent the preaching of the gospel in that region. But this
very occurrence roused the whole country as nothing else
could have done, and directed attention to Christ. Though
the Saviour Himself departed, the men whom He had healed,
remained as witnesses to His power. Those who had been
mediums of the prince of darkness, became channels of light,
messengers of the Son of God. Men marveled as they
listened to the wondrous news. A door was opened to the gos-
 pel throughout that region. When Jesus returned to De-
capolis, the people flocked about Him, and for three days, not
merely the inhabitants of one town, but thousands from all the
 surrounding region, heard the message of salvation."—"The
 Desire of Ages," p. 340.
    In the days of Christ and the apostles, miracles of healing
were ofttimes the means of allaying prejudice and establish-
 ing faith. While heaven. and earth are no farther apart
to-day than when Christ walked with men, miraculous restora-
 tions to health in so-called Christian lands are apparently of
more rare occurrence. Laborers 'in darkened mission fields,
however, where prejudice and incredulity are great, are fre-

    1.HE plans and work of men are not keeping pace
 with the providence of God; for while some in these
 countries who claim to believe the truth declare by
 their attitude, 'We want not Thy way, 0 Lord, but
 our own way,' there are many that are pleading with
 God that they may understand what, is truth. In
 secret places they are weeping and praying that they
 may see light in the Scriptures, and the Lord of

 with human agencies in carrying forward His vast de-

quently made to realize that God in a special way witnesses to
His name and signally rewards the simple faith of converts
from heathenism.
    6. "We should pray as earnestly for the descent of the
Holy Spirit as the disciples prayed on the day of Pentecost.
If they needed it at that time, we need it more to-day."—
"Testimonies," vol. 5, p. 158.
    "There is no limit to the usefulness of the one who, putting
self aside, makes room for the working of the Holy Spirit
upon his heart, and lives a life wholly consecrated to God."
— Id., vol. 8, p. 19.
    "With the consecrated worker for God, in whatever place
he may be, the Holy Spirit abides. The words spoken to the
disciples are spoken also to us. The Comforter is ours as well
as theirs. The Spirit furnishes the strength that sustains
striving, wrestling souls in every emergency, amidst the
hatred of the world, and the realization of their own failures
and mistakes. In sorrow and affliction, when the outlook
seems dark and the future perplexing, and we feel helpless
and alone,— these are the times when, in answer to the prayer
of faith, the Holy Spirit brings comfort to the heart."—"The
Acts of the Apostles," p. 51.

                             Notes
    1. "He [Paul] was regarded by the rabbis as a young man
of great promise, and high hopes were cherished concerning
him as an able and zealous defender of the ancient faith. His
elevation to membership in the Sanhedrim council placed him
in a position of power."-"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 112.
    2. "Thus Jesus gave sanction to the authority of His or-
ganized church, and placed Saul in connection with His
appointed agencies on earth. Christ had now a church as His
representative on earth, and to it belonged the work of direct-
ing the repentant sinner in the way of life. . . . In Christ's
stead, Ananias touches the eyes of Saul, that they may re-
ceive sight. In Christ's stead, he places his hands upon him,
and as he prays in Christ's name, Saul receives the Holy
Ghost. All is done in the name and by the authority of Christ.
24          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

Christ is the fountain; the church is the channel of communi-
cation."— Id., p. 122.
    3.. "Both Paul anCBarnabas had already received their
commission from God Himself, and the ceremony of the laying
on of hands added no new grace or virtual qualification. It
was an acknowledged form of designation to an appointed
office, and a recognition of one's authority in that office. By it
the seal of the church was set upon the work of God."— Id.,
pp. 161, 162.
    4. "The consecrated messengers who in the early days of
 Christianity carried to a perishing world the glad tidings of
 salvation, allowed no thought of self-exaltation to mar their
 presentation of Christ and Him crucified. They coveted
 neither authority nor preeminence. Hiding self in the Sav-
 iour, they exalted the great plan of salvation, and the life of
 Christ, the author and finisher of this plan. Christ, the same •
 yesterday, to-day, and forever, was the burden of their
teaching.
    "If those who to-day are teaching the word of God, would
 uplift the cross of Christ higher and still higher, their min-
istry would be far more successful. If sinners can be led to
 give one earnest look at the cross, if they can obtain a full
view of the crucified Saviour, they will realize the depth of
 God's compassion and the sinfulnessof sin."— Id., p. 209.
    5. "He [Paul] illustrated in a practical way what might
be done by consecrated laymen in many places where the
people were unacquainted with the truths of the gospel. His
course inspired many humble toilers with a desire to do what
they could to advance the cause of God, while at the same
time they supported themselves in daily labor."— Id., p. 355.
The great apostle ever conducted his missionary efforts in
such a way that everything should be free from the taint of
commercialism or the suspicion of covetousness. It is evident,
however, that Paul felt at one time that he had done the
churches harm by relieving them of all financial responsibility
concerning himself. 2 Cor. 12: 13.
    6. "For some time Paul had been carrying a burden of
soul for the churches,— a burden so heavy that he could
scarcely endure it. False teachers had sought to destroy his
influence among the believers, and to urge their own doctrines
in the place of gospel truth. The perplexities and discourage-
ments with which Paul was surrounded are revealed in the
words, 'We were pressed out of measure, above strength, in-
somuch that we despaired even of life.' "—Id., p. 825.
    7. "Well-nigh a score of centuries have passed since Paul
the Aged poured out his blood as a witness for the word of
God and the testimony of Jesus Christ. No faithful hand re-
corded for the generations to come the last scenes in the life
of this holy man; but Inspiration has preserved for us his
             SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARIKKLY                             25

dying testimony. Like a trumpet peal his voice has rung out
through all the ages since, nerving with his own courage thou-
sands of witnesses for Christ, and wakening in thousands of
sorrow-stricken hearts the echo of his own triumphant joy:
`I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is
at hand. I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course,
I have kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up for me a
crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge,
shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all
them also that love His appearing.' "- Id., p. 513.

                             Notes
    1. "Christ showed them that salvation is like the sunshine.
It belongs to the whole world. The religion of the Bible is
not to be confined between the covers of a book, nor within
the walls of a church. It is not to be brought out occasionally-
for our own benefit, and then to be carefully laid aside again.
It is to sanctify the daily life, to manifest itself in every
business transaction and in all our social relations. True
character is not shaped from without, and put on ; it radiates
from within."—"The Desire of Ages," pp. 306, 807.
    2. In the ancient sanctuary service, the lights in the taber-
nacle were, by divine command, "to burn continually," in order
that the children of Israel should ever remember their
privilege and responsibility as the world's light-bearers. Lev.
24: 2; 1 Kings 11: 36. How eminently fitting that in the
gospel dispensation, the church should be typified by seven
lamps of fire ordained consecutively to light the pilgrims'
pathway between the first and second advents!
    3. The definition of the word "Ephesus" is "desirable,"
which may be taken as a term descriptive of the character of
the early church. Those early Christians had received the
doctrine of Christ in its purity. They enjoyed the benefits
and blessings of the gifts of the Holy Spirit. They were noted
for works, labor, and patience. In faithfulness to the pure
principles taught by Christ, they could not bear those that
were evil, and they tried false apostles, searched out their
true characters, and found them liars.
    4. In the vision of the seven churches, the spiritual history
of the church of Christ is developed in seven eras, or periods,
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   27

from apostolic days to the end of time. The seven seals sug-
gest a line of prophecy covering the same general period,
bringing out additional phases of history. The series of the
seven churches gives a view of the church of Christ in the
midst of apostasy and through the experiences of the latter
days.
    The white horse, with the rider bearing a bow and having
a crown on his head, who goes forth conquering and to con-
quer, is a fit emblem of the triumphs of the gospel in the first
century. The whiteness of the horse denotes the purity of the
faith for that age; and the crown which was given to the
rider, and his successful conquests, symbolize the zeal and
success of the gospel by its earliest ministers.
    5. Most noticeable is the transition in the appearance of
the horses from the state indicating church purity to that
which signifies a lifeless Christianity. During the latter por-
tion of this period, history records but the most meager mis-
sionary operations. However, no age was left wholly without
witnesses for the gospel.
    6. The well-nigh impregnable Piedmont valleys afforded
the Waldensian Christians a providential retreat from the
hostilities and terrors of Rome. Here in simple faith they
worshiped God, conducted their schools, and commissioned
their missionaries. The home of the Albigenses in south-
western France was another portion of the "wilderness" where
"the woman" found a shelter; while a few centuries later, the
newly discovered American continent provided an asylum for
thousands of the oppressed and persecuted. The Hussite
nobles successfully defended their faith in Bohemia; and a
century later the Protestant princes of Germany threw off
the papal yoke. Afterwards, when their cause seemed lost,
King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden came to their aid and
helped save the day for Protestantism. A little later the
Netherlands and England dissolved their allegiance with
Rome; thus "the earth helped the woman," and "opened her
mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out
of his mouth." Nearly the half of Europe was opened to
evangelical teaching and influence.
     7. Those who figured largely in the fulfillment of the latter
part of this prophecy were such men as Martin Luther, John
 Wycliffe, John Huss, John Knox, John Wesley, Roger Wil-
liams, and others. The work of these men, covering the period
 of the early and later reformation, was the means of termi-
 nating the supreme spiritual reign of the papacy over the
minds of men. During this time, many martyrs were made to
the cause of Christ. Victories could only be made by great
 personal sacrifice. By fire, by sword, by banishment, by the
 rack, and in a thousand other ways, the enemy of righteous-
 ness tried to overcome the messengers of light.

                             Notes
   1. "In this vision the two olive trees which stand before
God are represented as emptying the golden oil out of them-
selves through golden tubes into the bowl of the candlestick.
From this the lamps of the sanctuary are fed, that they may
give a bright, continuous light. So from the anointed ones
that stand in God's presence the fullness of divine light and
love and power is imparted to His people, that they may im-
part to others light and joy and refreshing."—"Prophets and
Kings," p. 594.
    "The two witnesses represent the Scriptures of the Old
and the New Testament. Both are _important testimonies to
the origin and perpetuity of the law of God. Both are wit-
nesses also to the plan of salvation. The types, sacrifices, and
prophecies of the Old Testament point forward to a Saviour
to come. The Gospels and Epistles of the New Testament tell
of a Saviour who has come in the exact manner foretold by
type and prophecy."—"The Great Controversy," p. 267.
    2. "'The grace that bringeth salvation' had appeared; but
France, after beholding its power and holiness, after thou-
sands had been drawn by its divine beauty, after cities and
hamlets had been illuminated by its radiance, had turned
away, choosing darkness rather than light. They had put
from them the heavenly gift, when it was offered them. They
had called evil good, and good evil, till they had fallen victims
to their willful self-deception. Now, though they might ac-
tually believe that they were doing God service in persecuting
 His people, yet their sincerity did not render them guiltless.
 The light that would have saved them from deception, from
30          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
 staining their souls with blood-guiltiness, they had willfully
 rejected."— Id., p. 229.
     Kings, nobles, and priests united in a solemn oath to "ex-
 tirpate heresy." The publication of the Scriptures was for-
 bidden, and thousands of innocent victims were burned at the
 stake or put to death with nameless cruelty.
     3. "When France rejected the gift of Heaven, she sowed
 the seeds of anarchy and ruin; and the inevitable outworking
 of cause and effect resulted in the Revolution and the Reign
 of Terror."— Id., p. 230.
     "Unhappy France reaped in blood the harvest she had
 sown." In the Reign of Terror, violence and lust held undis-
 puted sway. The execution of king and queen, nobles and
 priests, was incited by a maddened communism. Bibles were
 publicly burned, the weekly Sabbath abolished, death de-
 clared an eternal sleep, and a dissolute woman worshiped as
 the Goddess of Reason. Without the keeping power of God's
 word, France found herself submerged in the licentiousness
 of Sodom and the darkness of Egypt.
     4. "In 1793, a decree passed the French Assembly sup-
 pressing the Bible. Just three years after, a resolution was
 introduced into the Assembly superseding the decree, and giv-
 ing toleration to the Scriptures. That resolution lay on the
;table six months, when it was taken up, and passed without
 a dissenting vote. Thus, in just three years and a half, the
 witnesses [the Old and the New Testament] 'stood upon their
 feet, and great fear fell upon them which saw them.' Noth-
 ing but the appalling results of the rejection of the Bible
 could have induced France to take her hands off these wit-
 nesses."—"Daniel and the Revelation," pp. 535, 536.
     5. While a spiritual paralysis seemed to have stupefied the
 popular churches of Christendom, there were during the
 eighteenth century some illustrious exceptions, among whom
 were the Moravian missionaries. John Wesley "for a short
 time abode with the Moravians, and was deeply impressed
 with their Christian deportment. Of one of their religious
 services, in striking contrast to the lifeless formalism of the
 Church of England, he wrote: 'The great simplicity as well as
 solemnity of the whole almost made me forget the seventeen
 hundred years between, and imagine myself in one of those
 assemblies where form and state were not; but Paul, the tent-
 maker, or Peter, the fisherman, presided; yet with the demon-
 stration of the Spirit and of power.' "—"The Great Contro-
versy," p. 255.
    6. Following their seeming defeat in the French Revolu-
tion, the "two witnesses" have been exalted to a height never
before attained. In 1804 the British and Foreign Bible So-
ciety was organized, followed by the American Bible Society
              SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                              31

in 1816. Other societies have also been organized, and the
following is a record of the total number of copies issued by
the leading societies from the time of their organization to the
year 1920:
      American Bible Society                            141,729,340
      British and Foreign Bible Society                 310,814,428
      National Bible Society of Scotland                 65,923,772
    This makes a total of 518,467,540 copies of the Bible or
portions of the Bible in about 733 languages or dialects. The
Bible Society Record says that during the last decade some
complete book of the• Bible has appeared in a new language
at the rate of one every six weeks.
    7. Jewish apostasy brought nakedness to the church, but
the prophecy of Isa. 49 : 18 looks forward to the time when
the church will again be clothed with conquests from all
lands. In many nations hitherto closed to Christ's ambas-
sadors, the gospel is being proclaimed with freedom. We
now see in many places the fulfillment of Isa. 49: 25, "Even
the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey
of the terrible shall be delivered: for I will contend with him
that contendeth with thee, and I will save thy children."

                            Notes
   1. The prophetic period extending to the time of the end
terminated in 1798. Entering upon this last-day epoch, three
great movements began: (a) an era of Bible study which un-
folded the great symbolic prophecies of Daniel and Revela-
tion; (b) the era of modern invention which has revolutionized
industry, transportation, and communication; (c) the era of
modern missions. In the many new trade routes that have
been opened; in the ocean greyhounds that speed upon their
courses; in the construction of railways over plain and
jungles in darkened continents, the church sees a mighty
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  33

Providence opening the road to the mission fields and pre-
paring for a quick work in the earth.
     2. "Under the figure of the early and the latter rain, that.
falls in Eastern lands at seedtime and harvest, the Hebrew
prophets foretold the bestowal of spiritual grace in extraordi-
nary measure upon God's church. The outpouring of the
Spirit in the days of the apostles was the beginning of
the early, or former, rain, and glorious was the result. To
the end of time, the presence of the Spirit is to abide with the
true church.
     "But near the close of earth's harvest, a special bestowal
of spiritual grace is promised to prepare the church for the
coming of the Son of man. This outpouring of the Spirit is
likened to the falling of the latter rain; and it is for this
added power that Christians are to send their petitions to the
Lord of the harvest 'in the time of the latter rain.' "—"The
Acts of the Apostles," pp. 54, 55.
     3. "Since this is the means by which we are to receive
power, why do we not hunger and thirst for the gift of the
 Spirit? Why do we not talk of it, pray for it, and preach
concerning it? The Lord is more willing to give the Holy
 Spirit to those who serve Him than parents are to give good
gifts to their children. For the daily baptism of the Spirit,
every worker should offer his petition to God. Companies of
 Christian workers should gather to ask for special help, for
 heavenly wisdom, that they may know how to plan and exe-
 cute wisely. Especially should they pray that God will
 baptize His chosen ambassadors in mission fields with a"rich
 measure of His Spirit."— Id., pp. 50, 51.
     4. "The work of this angel comes in at the right time to
 join in the last great work of the third angel's message, as
 it swells to a loud cry. And the people of God are thus pre-
 pared to stand in the hour of temptation, which they are
 soon to meet. I saw a great light resting upon them, and they
 united to fearlessly proclaim the third angel's message."—
 "Early Writings," p. 277.
      5. "Servants of God, endowed with power from on high,
 with their faces lighted up, and shining with holy consecra-
 tion, went forth to proclaim the message from heaven. Souls
 that were scattered all through the religious bodies answered
 to the call, and the precious were hurried out of the doomed
 churches, as Lot was hurried out of Sodom before her destruc-
 tion."— Id., pp. 278, 279.
      Since Jonah could warn that great metropolis, Nineveh,
 by one day's preaching; since Ahasuerus could convey a mes-
 sage to the one hundred twenty-seven provinces of his great
 empire within a period of nine months, it is evident that an
 infinite God can warn the present world in an incredibly brief
 space.

                            Notes
    1. "It is a heaven-appointed plan that men should return
to the Lord His own; and this is so plainly stated that men
and women have no excuse for misunderstanding or evading
the duties and responsibilities God has laid upon them."—
"Testimonies," vol. 6, p. 387.
    2. "The Lord has given His people a message for this time.
It is presented in the third chapter of Malachi. How could
the Lord present His requirements in a clearer or more
forcible manner than He has done in this chapter?"—
Id., p. 384.
    "Had God's plan been followed, means would now be flow-
ing into His treasury; and funds to enable ministers to enter
new fields, and workers to unite with ministers in lifting up
the standard of truth in the dark places of the earth, would
be abundant"— Id., p. 386.
     3. In this promise do you not hear God speaking to you?
"My child, I still have windows in heaven. They are yet in
service. The bolts slide as easily as of old. The hinges have
not grown rusty. I would rather fling them open, and pour
 forth, than keep them shut, and hold back. I opened them for
 Moses, and the sea parted. I opened them for Joshua, and
 Jordan rolled back. I opened them for Gideon, and the hosts
 fled. I will open them for you — if you will only let Me. On
 this side of the windows, heaven is the same rich storehouse
 as of old. The fountains and streams still overflow. The
 treasure-rooms are still bursting with gifts. The lack is not
 on My side. It is on yours. I am waiting. I am ready. Prove
 Me now."
     4. "It was a costly sacrifice that the Lord of heaven made.
 Divine benevolence was stirred to its unfathomable depths; it
 was impossible for God to give more. He 'so loved the world,
 that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth
 in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.' John
3: 16. Why is our gratitude so limited? It is only as a ripple
36             SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

on the surface, compared with the great tide of love that
flows to us from the Father."—"Testimonies," vol. 9,.pp. 59, 60.
    "If those to whom God's money has been entrusted will be
faithful in bringing the means lent them to the Lord s treas-
ury, His work will make rapid advancement. Many souls will
be won to the cause of truth, and the day of Christ's coming
will be hastened. . . .
    "So God's work in our world is to be carried forward.
Faithful stewards are to place the Lord's money in His treas-
ury, that workers may be sent to all parts of the world. The
church here below is to serve God with self-denial and sacri-
fice. Thus the work is to be carried forward and the most
glorious triumphs won."— Id., pp. 58, 59.
    5. "Love will be revealed in sacrifice. The plan of re-
demption was laid in sacrifice,— a sacrifice so broad and deep
and high that it is immeasurable. Christ gave all for us, and
those who receive Christ will be ready to sacrifice all for the
sake of their Redeemer. The thought of His honor and glory
will come before anything else. If we love Jesus, we shall love
to live for Him, to present our thank-offerings to Him, to
labor for Him. The very labor will be light. For His sake
we shall covet pain and toil and sacrifice. We shall sympa-
thize with His longing for the salvation of men. We shall
feel the same tender craving for souls that He has felt. This
is the religion of Christ. Anything short of it is a deception."

                     •        Notes
    1. "There is nothing finer nor more pathetic to me," says
Dr. Forsyth, "than the way in which missionaries unlearn the
love of the old home, die to their native land, and wed their
hearts to the people they have served and won; so that they
can not rest in England [or other homelands], but must return
38          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

to lay their bones where they spent their hearts for Christ.
How vulgar the common patriotisms seem beside this inverted
homesickness, this passion of a kingdom which has no fron-
tiers and no favored race, the passion of a homeless Christ!"
    2. Foreign missions exact a heavy toll in financial output,
labors, separations, broken ties, privations, failing health, and
sometimes life itself. But while the missionary enterprise
costs, it also pays. The heathen who has forsaken his super-
stition and fears, to become a new creature in Jesus Christ,
will look up with glowing, thankful face, and tell you that the
undertaking pays. The humble laborer who has toiled hard
on his farm or in his shop, and has been self-denying that he
may give generously to the work of God, ever testifies that
the triumphs of the cross more than repay him. The person
who has left the comforts and associations of his native land
to turn the heathen from idolatry to the living God, will tell
you that in true joy and satisfaction, no other pursuit in this
world yields so heavy a dividend. And the angels in their
songs on high affirm in melody and praise that the priceless
Gift of heaven, and all the sacrifices of earth, are none too
precious for the redemption of the lost.
    3. "Not all who enter the army are to be generals, captains,
sergeants, or even corporals. Not all have the care and re-
sponsibility of leaders. There is hard work of other kinds to
be done. Some must dig trenches and build fortifications;
some are to stand as sentinels, some to carry messages. While
there are but few officers, it requires many soldiers to form
the rank and file of the army; yet its success depends upon the
fidelity of every soldier. . . . Every act of loyalty and faith
will be crowned with special tokens of God's favor and appro-
bation."—"Gospel Workers," pp. 84, 85.
    4. On one occasion, the young disciple Mark, being unused
 to hardships, and disheartened by the perils and privations
of the way, deserted the mission field. Later, however, he
acquired experience in the mission school of endurance, and
was recommended by Paul as "profitable" to him "for the
 ministry."
     5. In the transformation of character, the casting out of
evil passions, the development of the sweet graces of God's
 Holy Spirit, we may see the fulfillment in our personal ex-
 perience of the promise, "Instead of the thorn shall come up
 the fir tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle
tree." It is our privilege to see our life's desert "rejoice, and
 blossom as the rose."
     6. With the marginal rendering of Dan. 12: 3, we read,
 "They that be teachers shall shine as the brightness. of the
 firmament." Commenting upon the word "stars" mentioned
 in this scripture, Elder Uriah Smith wrote: "The dew of
              SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                         39
youth-still seems fresh upon them. No broken outline shows
the foothold of decay; no faltering motion reveals the decrepi-
tude of age. Of all things visible, these stand next to the
Ancient of days; and their undiminished glory is a prophecy
of eternity. And thus shall they who turn many to righteous-
ness shine in a glory that shall bring joy even to the heart of
the Redeemer; and thus shall their years roll on forever and
ever."-"Daniel and the Revelation," p. 331.

   Why not make the Thirteenth Sabbath a "squaring up"
day for the quarter? The Sabbath schools are expected to
raise one half the sixty cents a week. Why not square up?
Why not keep square?
