                               Notes
    1. The Scriptures here mentioned, and which Timothy had
known from a child (2 Tim. 3: 15), were no doubt those writ-
ings now collected under the general name of the Old Testa-
ment. Peter spoke of those who wrested not only the writing
of Paul, but "the other Scriptures," to their own destruction.
 (See 2 Peter 3: 16.)
    "The Bible points to God as its author; yet it was written
by human hands; and in the varied style of its different books
it presents the characteristics of the several writers. The
truths revealed are all 'given by inspiration of God' (2 Tim.
3: 16) ; yet they are expressed in the words of men. The In-
finite One by His Holy Spirit has shed light into the minds
and hearts of His servants. He has given dreams and visions,
symbols and figures; and those to whom the truth was thus
revealed, have themselves embodied the thought in human
language.
    "The ten commandments were spoken by God Himself, and
were written by His own hand. They are of divine, and not
of human composition. But the Bible, with its God-given
truths expressed in the language. of men, presents a union of
the divine and the human. Such a union existed in the nature
of Christ; who was the Son of God and the Son of man. Thus
it is true of the Bible, as it was of Christ, that the Word was
made flesh, and dwelt among us.' John 1: 14."—"The Great
Controversy," Introduction, pp. v, vi.
     2. The Revised Version of 2 Peter 1: 21 reads: "For no
 prophecy ever came by the will of man: but men spake from
 God, being moved by the Holy Spirit." What was called "the
 Scriptures" was known under three general divisions: (a) the
"law," (b) the "prophets," (c) the "psalms." Luke 24: 44.
 Moses was a prophet (Deut. 34: 10) ; David was a prophet
  (Acts 2: 29, 30). Men are the instruments; but when their
 speak for God, they are moved by the Holy Spirit.
4           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

     3. The words of the Holy Spirit are not only the words
of man, but %re the words of God.
     4. God's words contain a depth of meaning which only His
Spirit can fully reveal to us. 1 Cor. 2: 11, 12. As rain and
snow are sent upon the earth to accomplish definite results,
so God's Word is sent to bring salvation, and it will accom-
plish this for all who receive it.
     "Receive into the soul by faith the incorruptible seed of
the Word, and it will bring forth a character and a life after
the similitude of the character and the life of God."—"Christ's
Object Lessons," p. 38.
  . The union of the divine and the human which exists in
Christ is found also in His Word. As Christ is given to each
one personally, so His Word is to be regarded by each one as
though he were the only one to whom God had thus spoken.
"The relations between God and each soul are as distinct and
full as though there were not another soul for whom He gave
His beloved Son."—"Steps to Christ," p. 105.
     5. "God will make the most precious revelations to His
hungering, thirsting people. They will find that Christ is a
personal Saviour. As they feed upon His Word, they find
that it is spirit and life. The Word destroys the natural,
earthly nature, and imparts a new life in Christ Jesus."—t"The
Desire of Ages," p. 391.
     6. A word has been defined as the expression of an idea.
Christ is the Word because He is the full and perfect revela-
tion of the thought of God. It is through Him and Him alone
that we know anything of the divine; hence He is the divine
Word, the perfect revelation, "the image of the invisible God,"
the One by whom "were all things created," and by whom "all
things consist," or hold together, He in whom "all fullness"
dwells, and who was with the Father in the beginning.
     7. "Satan well knows that all whom he can lead to neglect
prayer and the searching of the Scriptures will be overcome
by his attacks. Therefore he invents every possible device to
engross the mind."—"The Great Controversy," p. 519.
     8. "The Word of God is the seed. Every seed has in itself
a germinating principle. In it the life'of the plant is enfolded.
So there is life in God's Word."—`!Christ's Object Les-
sons," p. 38.


   Have you formed the daily study habit? "None but those
who have fortified the mind with the truths of the Bible will
stand through the last great conflict."—"The Great Contro-
versy," p. 593.

                              Notes
    1. There was once a controversy in heaven concerning the
authority of God's word. "Michael [Christ] and His angels
fought against the dragon [Satan] ; and the dragon fought
and his angels." Rev. 12: 7. The integrity and power of God's
word were sustained, and it was forever settled in heaven
among the angelic host and unfallen worlds that God's word
is true, and must stand forever.
    2. In the salvation of sinners, we see the power of God
exercised to redeem. Redemption is re-creation, or creating
anew. Any teaching that denies Christ's creative power de-
nies equally His power to save from sin.
    3. It is only by faith that we can understand the work of
creation. The things which are made, bear testimony to "His
eternal power and Godhead" (Rom. 1: 20), and encourage us
to trust in God to supply all our needs, and to create us anew
in Christ Jesus.
    4. While scientists may speculate and guess concerning
the origin of the world, the one who believes God's Word,
knows how it came into existence. It is only because men
"willfully forget" (2 Peter 3: 5, A. R. V.), that they are
ignorant concerning creation.
    5. The difference between God's Word and man's word is
just as great as the difference between God and man, which is
infinite. God's Word contains a depth of meaning which only
His Spirit can reveal to us. When spoken faithfully, it will
have effect, and produce righteousness in the heart of those
who believe.
    6. "Temptations often appear irresistible because, through
neglect of prayer and the study of the Bible, the tempted one
can not readily remember God's promises and meet Satan with
the Scripture weapons."—"The Great Controversy," p. 600.
    "As our physical life is sustained by food, so our spiritual
life is sustained by the Word of God. And every soul is to
receive life from God's Word for himself. As we must eat for
ourselves in order to receive nourishment, so we must receive
the Word for ourselves."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 890.

                               Notes
     1. Jesus saves His people not in sin, but from sin. "From
•the beginning, God and Christ knew of the apostasy of Satan,
 and of the fall of man through the deceptive power of the
 apostate. God did not ordain that sin should exist, but He
 foresaw its existence, and made provision to meet the terrible
 emergency."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 22.
     2. "It was Satan's purpose to bring about an eternal sep-
 aration between God and man; but in Christ we become more
 closely united to God than if we had never fallen. In taking
 our nature, the Saviour has bound Himself to humanity by
 a tie that is never to be broken. Through the eternal ages
 He is linked with us. 'God so loved the world, that He gave
 His only-begotten Son.' He gave Him not only to bear our
 sins, and to die as our sacrifice; He gave Him to the fallen
 race. To assure us of His immutable counsel of peace, God
 gave His only-begotten Son to become one of the human family,
 forever to retain His human nature."— Id., p. 25.
     3. Pilate was the trial judge. After he had heard all the
 evidence which His enemies could bring against Him who,
 when reviled, reviled not, when suffering, threatened not, he
 was unable to find in Him any fault at all. And no one since
 Pilate's day has been able to find any fault in Him. We have
 a Sinless One for our Saviour.
     4. "In the parable the shepherd goes out to search for one
 sheep,— the very least that can be numbered. So if there had
 been but one lost soul, Christ would have died for that one."
 —"Christ's. Object Lessons," p. 187.
     5. "To the cross of Calvary, bearing a dying Saviour, we
 must look. Our eternal interests demand that we show faith
 in Christ."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 660.
     "The lifting up of the brazen serpent was to teach Israel
 an important lesson. They could not save themselves from
 the fatal effect of the poison in their wounds. God alone was
 able to heal them. Yet they were required to show their faith
 in the provision which He had made. They must look, in order
 to live. It was their faith that was acceptable with God, and
 by looking upon the serpent their faith was shown. . . . So
 the sinner may look to Christ, and live. He receives pardon
 through faith in the atoning sacrifice. Unlike the inert and
 lifeless symbol, Christ has power and virtue in Himself
 to heal- the repenting sinner."—"Patriarchs and Prophets,"
 pp. 430, 431.
             SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                           9
   6. "Those whose course has been most offensive to Him He
freely accepts; when they repent, He imparts to them His
divine Spirit, places them in the highest positions of trust,
and sends them forth into the camp of the disloyal to proclaim
His boundless mercy."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 826.
   "When Satan seeks to cover the people of God with black-
ness, and ruin them, Christ interposes. Although they have
sinned, Christ has taken the guilt of their sins upon His own
soul. He has snatched the race as a brand from the fire. By
His human nature He is linked with man, while through His
divine nature He is one with the infinite God. Help is brought
within the reach of perishing souls. The adversary is re-
buked."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 169.
   7. "So Christ, the great high priest, pleading His blood
before the Father in the sinner's behalf, bears upon His heart
the name of every repentant, believing soul."—"Patriarchs
and Prophets," p. 351.
   8. "The life of the vine becomes the life of the 'branch.
So the soul dead in trespasses and sins receives life through
connection with Christ. By faith in Him as a personal Saviour
the union is formed. The sinner unites his weakness to
Christ's strength, his emptiness to Christ's fullness, his frailty
to Christ's enduring might. Then he has the mind of Christ.
The humanity of Christ has touched our humanity, and our
humanity has touched divinity. Thus through the agency of
the Holy Spirit man becomes a partaker of• the divine nature.
He is accepted in the Beloved."—"The Desire of Ages,"
pp. 675, 676.

                               Notes.
    1. "If one sin is cherished in the soul, or one wrong prac-
tice retained in the life, the whole being is contaminated. The
man becomes an instrument of unrighteousness."-"The De-
sire of Ages," p. 313.
    2. This promise of victory is received through Christ. He
is the "Victory of Israel" (1 Sam. 15: 29, margin). Victory
is a gift, received by faith. We are saved, not by what we do
for God, but by what God does for us.
    "Let him who is struggling against the power of appetite,
look to the Saviour in the wilderness of temptation. See Him
in His agony upon the cross, as He exclaimed, 'I thirst.' He
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  11

has endured all that it is possible for us to bear. His victory
is ours."— Id., p. 123.
    3. We are to stand, not flee from the enemy. There is no
armor for the back. Victory has been defined as the abandon-
ment of every known sin, and obedience to every known duty.
    "We can overcome. Yes; fully, entirely. Jesus died to
make a way of escape for us, that we might overcome every
evil temper, every sin, every temptation, and sit down at last
with Him."—"Testimonies," vol. 1, p. 144.
    "I would not dishonor my Master so much as to admit that
a careless, trifling, prayerless person is a Christian. No; a
Christian has victory over his besetments, over his passions.
There is a remedy for the sin-sick soul. That remedy is in
Jesus. Precious Saviour! His grace is sufficient for the
weakest; and the strongest must also have His grace or
perish."— Id., p. 158.
    4. "The love of God does not lead Him to excuse sin. He
did not excuse it in Satan; He did not excuse it in Adam or
in Cain ; nor will He excuse it in any other of the children of
men. He will not connive at our sins or overlook our defects
of character. He expects us to overcome in His name."—
"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 316.
    5. "The tempter's agency is not to be accounted an excuse
for one wrong act. Satan is jubilant when he hears the pro-
fessed followers of Christ making excuses for their deformity
of character. It is these excuses that lead to sin. There is
no excuse for sinning. A holy temper, a Christlike life, i.s
accessible to every repenting, believing child of God."—"The
Desire of Ages," p. 311.
    6. It is the presence of Jesus through the Spirit in the
heart that makes one holy.
    "The ideal of Christian character is Christlikeness. As the
Son of man was perfect in His life, so His followers are to be
perfect in their life. Jesus was in all things made like unto
His brethren. He became flesh, even as we are. He was
hungry and thirsty and weary. He was sustained by food and
refreshed by sleep. He shared the lot of man; yet He was
the blameless Son of God. He was God in the flesh. His
character is to be ours."— /bid.
    7. "Satan carefully studies the constitutional sins• of men,
and then he begins his work of alluring and ensnaring them.
We are in the thickest of temptations, but there is victory for
us if we fight manfully the battles of the Lord."—"Testi-
monies," vol. 5, p. 97.
    8. "How many, when they are made well, forget the hand
that healed them, and instead of gratitude and obedience to
 God, use their renewed health and strength in the service of
12            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

sin. Those who make this use of God's mercies may consider
their restoration as a respite only from perdition."- Clarke.
    9. "Satan can not hold the dead in his grasp when the Son
of God bids them live. He can not hold in spiritual death one
soul who in faith receives Christ's word of power."-"The
Desire of Ages," p. 320.

                              Notes
    1. "The only faith that will benefit us is that which em-
braces Him as a personal Saviour; which appropriates His
merits to ourselves. Many hold faith as an opinion. Saving
faith is a transaction, by which those who receive Christ join
themselves in covenant relation with God. Genuine faith is.
life. A living faith means an increase of vigor, a confiding
trust, by which the soul becomes a conquering power."—"The
Desire of Ages," p. 347.
    2. "No man who makes any reserve can be the disciple of
Christ, much less can he be His colaborer."— Id., p. 273.
    "We do not belong to Christ unless we are His wholly.
It is by half-heartedness in the Christian life that men become
feeble in purpose and changeable in desire."—"Christ's Ob-.
ject Lessons," p. 50.
    "Many who profess to be His followers have an anxious,
troubled heart, because they are afraid to trust themselves
with God. They do not make a complete surrender to Him;
for they shrink from the consequences that such a surrender
may involve. Unless they do make this surrender, they can
not find peace."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 330.
     3. It is ourselves for which the Lord calls. We may ren-
der service, money; stock, farms, even our own bodies, yet
withhold ourselves. "I seek not yours, but you" (2 Cor. 12:
14), wrote the apostle. There is no substitute for an uncondi-
tional surrender of the heart.
     4. "When the Spirit of GO takes possession of the heart,
it transforms the life. Sinful thoughts are put away, evil
deeds are renounced; love, humility, and peace take the place
of anger, envy, and strife. Joy takes the place of sadness,
and the countenance reflects the light of heaven. No one sees
the hand that lifts the burden, or beholds the light descend
from the courts above. The blessing comes when by faith the
soul surrenders itself to God. Then that power which no
human eye can see, creates a new being in the image of God."
 —"The Desire of Ages," pp. 172, 173.
     5. "When the soul surrenders itself to Christ, a new
 power takes possession of the new heart. A change is wrought
 which man can never accomplish for himself. It is a super-
 natural work, bringing a supernatural element into human
14         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

nature. The soul that is yielded to Christ, becomes His own
fortress, which He holds in a revolted world, and He intends
that no authority shall be known in it but His own. A soul
thus kept in possession, by the heavenly agencies, is impreg-
nable to the assaults of Satan."— Id., pp. 323, 324.
    6. "First gave their own selves." This points the way to
the solution of all our financial difficulties, and the finishing
of the work in all the earth. When we consecrate ourselves
first to God, then we will lay all we have on the altar. There
will then be plenty of workers and funds to finish the work
in all the world.
    "The greatest sin which now exists in the church is covet-
ousness. God frowns upon His professed people for their
selfishness."—"Testimonies," vol. 1, p. 194-
    7. "The righteousness of Christ will not cover one cher-
ished sin."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 316.
    8. "Many are inquiring, 'How am I to make the surrender
of myself to God?' You desire to give yourself to Him, but
you are weak in moral power, in slavery to doubt, and con-
trolled by the habits of your life of sin. Your promises and
resolutions are like ropes of sand. You can not control your
thoughts, your impulses, your affections. The knowledge of
your broken promises and forfeited pledges weakens your con-
fidence in your own sincerity, and causes you to feel that God
can not accept you; but you need not despair. What you need
to understand is the true force of the will. This is the gov-
erning power in the nature of man, the power of decision, or
of choice. Everything depends on the right action of the will.
The power of choice God has given to men; it is theirs to
exercise. You can not change your heart, you can not of your-
self give to God its affections; but you can Choose to serve Him.
You can give Him your will; He will then work in you to will
and to do according to His good pleasure. Thus your whole
 nature will be brought under the control of the Spirit of
 Christ; your affections will be centered upon Him, your
thoughts will be in harmony with Him."—"Steps to Christ,"
 pp. 51, 52.

        condition? Col. 2 : 9, 10.
                              Notes
    1. "The only defense against evil is the indwelling of Christ
in the heart through faith in His righteousness. Unless we
become vitally connected with God, we can never resist the
unhallowed effects of self-love, self-indulgence, and temptation
to sin. We may leave off many bad habits, for the time we
may part company with Satan; but without a vital connection
with God, through the surrender of ourselves to Him moment
by moment, we shall be overcome. Without a personal ac-
quaintance with Christ, and a continual communion, we are at
the mercy of the enemy, and shall do his bidding in the end."—
"The Desire of Ayes," p. 324.
    2. It is only through an abiding Christ within the heart,
that His life can be manifest in our lives. To dwell there,
He must have all the heart. Christ will not share the throne
of the heart with an idol.
    3. It is not enough to believe that Christ has cleansed the
temple of the soul from sin. We must believe that Jesus takes
possession of the cleansed heart, so when the enemy returns,
he will find Jesus enthroned in the heart, and there is no place
for the evil one.
    4. "It is faith that connects us with heaven, and brings
us strength for coping with the powers of darkness. In
Christ, God has provided means for subduing every sinful
trait, and resisting every temptation', however strong."—"The
Desire of Ages," p. 428.
    5. "It is through the Spirit that Christ dwells in us; and
the Spirit of God, received into the heart by faith, is the be-
ginning of the life eternal."— Id., p. 388.
    6. " 'Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man
hear My voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and
will sup with him, and he with Me.' I saw that many have so
much rubbish piled up at the door of their heart that they can
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  17

not get the door open. Some have difficulties between them-
selves and their brethren to remove. Others have evil tempers,
selfish covetousness, to remove before they can open the
door. Others have rolled the world before the door of their
heart, which bars the door. All this rubbish must be taken
away, and then they can open the door and welcome the
Saviour in.
    "Oh, how precious was this promise, as it was shown to
me in vision! 'I will come in to him, and will sup with him,
and he with Me.' Oh, the love, the wondrous love of God!
After all our lukewarmness and sins He says, 'Return unto
Me, and I will return unto thee, and will heal all thy back-
slidings.' This was repeated by the angel a number of times.
`Return unto Me, and I will return unto thee, and will heal all
thy backslidings.' "—"Testimonies," vol. 1, p. 143.
    "Marvelous will be the transformation wrought in him
who by faith opens the door of the' heart to the Saviour."—
"Ministry of Healing," p. 93.
    7. "Henceforward Christ's followers were to look upon
Satan as a conquered foe. Upon the cross, Jesus was to gain
the victory for them; that victory He desired them to accept
as their own."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 490.
    It is encouraging to the struggling child of God to know
that he is contending against a foe who has been conquered,
whose kingdom has been spoiled, and triumphed over. "When
Jesus was laid in the grave, Satan triumphed. He dared to
hope that the Saviour would not take up His life again. He
claimed the Lord's body, and set his guard about the tomb,
seeking to hold Christ a prisoner. He was bitterly angry
when his angels fled at the approach of the heavenly mes-
senger. When he saw Christ come forth in triumph, he knew
that his kingdom would have an end, and that he must finally
die."—Id., p. 782.
    8. Psalm 20: 5, the Revised Version, margin, reads, "We
will triumph in Thy victory." Christ met the enemy upon
every point where we must meet him (Heb. 4: 15), and won
the victory. This victory was not for Himself, but for us.
When we open our heart and Jesus comes in, He brings to us
the victory which He Himself won over all the powers of
darkness.

love. How important, then, that it be so trained as to be most
effective for good."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 335.

speaking, no frivolous talk, no fretful repining or impure
suggestion, will escape the lips of him who is following Christ.
The apostle Paul, writing by the Holy Spirit, says, 'Let no
corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth.' A corrupt
communication does not mean only words that are vile. It
means any expression contrary to holy principles and pure
and undefiled religion. It includes impure hints and covert
insinuations of evil. Unless instantly resisted, these lead to
great sin."— Id., p. 337.
    "Closely connected with Christ's warning in regard to•the
sin against the Holy Spirit is a warning against idle and
evil words."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 323.
    3. "There was in Him [Jesus] nothing that responded to
Satan's sophistry. He did not consent to sin. Not even by a
thought did He yield to temptation. So it may be with us.' —
Id., p. 123.
    "The light shining from the cross reveals the love of God.
 His love is drawing us to Himself. If we do not resist this
 drawing, we shall be led to the foot of the cross in repentance
for the sins that have crucified the Saviour. Then the Spirit
 of God, through faith produces a new life in the. soul. The
 thoughts and desires are brought into obedience to the will of
 Christ.?The heart, the mind, are created anew in the image
 of Him who works in us to subdue all things to Himself."—
 Id., p. 176.
     4. "Dwell upon the good qualities of those with whom you
 associate, and see as little as possible of their errors and fail-
 ings. . . . Let nothing but kind, loving words fall from
20          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
your lips concerning the members of your family or of the
church."—"Testimonies," vol. 2, pp. 437, 438.
    5. "I was shown that love of the world has to a great ex-
tent shut Jesus from the church. God calls for a change —
a surrender of all to Him. Unless the mind is educated to
dwell upon religious themes, it will be weak and feeble in this
direction. But while dwelling upon worldly enterprises it will
be strong, for in this direction it has been cultivated, and has
strengthened with exercise. The reason it is so difficult for
men and women to live religious lives is because they do not
exercise the mind unto godliness. It is trained to run in an
opposite direction. Unless the mind is constantly exercised in
obtaining spiritual knowledge, and in seeking to understand
the mystery of godliness, it is incapable of appreciating
eternal things, because it has no experience in that direction.
This is the reason why nearly all consider it uphill business
to serve the Lord."— Id., p. 189.
    6. "Those who condemn or criticize others, proclaim them-
selves guilty; for they do the same things. In condemning
others, they are passing sentence upon themselves, and God
declares that this sentence is just. He accepts their own
verdict against themselves."—"Thoughts from the Mount of
Blessing," p. 179, new edition.
    7. "He who is guilty of wrong, is the first to suspect wrong.
By condemning another he is trying to conceal or excuse the
evil of his own heart. It was through sin that men gained the
knowledge of evil; no sooner had the first pair sinned than
they began to accuse each other; and this is what human
nature will inevitably do, when uncontrolled by the grace of
Christ."— Id., pp. 181, 182.
   8. "If Christ is in you 'the hope of glory,' you will have
no disposition to watch others, to expose their errors. Instead
of seeking to accuse and condemn, it will be your object to
help, to bless, and to save. In dealing with those who are in
error, you will heed the injunction, Consider 'thyself, lest thou
also be tempted.' . . .
   "He who looks often upon the cross of Calvary, remember-
ing that his sins placed the Saviour there, will never try to
estimate the degree of his guilt in comparison with that of
others. He will not climb upon the judgment seat to bring
accusation against another. There can be no spirit of criti-
cism or self-exaltation on the part of those who walk in the
shadow of Calvary's cross.
   "Not until you feel that you could sacrifice your own self-
dignity, and even lay down your life, in order to save an erring
brother, have you cast the beam out of your own eye, so that
you are prepared to help your brother. Then you can ap-
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    21
proach him, and touch his heart. No one has ever been re-
claimed from a wrong position by censure and reproach; but
many have thus been driven from Christ, and led to seal their
hearts against conviction."— Id., pp. 183-185.
     9. "The habit of backbiting, gossip, ungenerous criticism
. . . reveals a lack of culture and refinement and of true good-
ness of heart; it unfits one both for the society of the truly
cultured and refined in this world and for association with
the holy ones of heaven. We think with horror of the can-
nibal who feasts on the still warm and trembling flesh of his
victim; but are the results of even this practice more terrible
than are the agony and ruin caused by misrepresenting motive,
blackening reputation, dissecting character? Let the children,
and the youth as well, learn what God says about these
things."—"Education," p. 235.
      "Nothing else in this world is so dear to God as His church.
 Nothing is guarded by Him with such jealous care. Nothing
so offends God as an act that injures the influence of those
who are doing His service. He will call to account all who
aid Satan in his work of criticizing and discouraging."—
"Testimonies," vol. 6, p. 42.
      10. "That which we do to others, whether it be good or
 evil, will surely react upon ourselves, in blessing or in cursing.
 Whatever we give, we shall receive again. The earthly bless-
 ings which we impart to others, may be, and often are, repaid
 in kind. What we give does, in times of need, often come back
 to us in fourfold measure in the coin of the realm. But, be-
 sides this, all gifts are repaid, even in this life, in the fuller
 inflowing of His love, which is the sum of all heaven's glory
 and its treasure. And evil imparted, also returns again.
 Every one who has been free to condemn or discourage, will
 in his own experience be brought over the ground where he
 has caused others to pass; he will feel what they have suf-
 fered because of his want of sympathy and tenderness."—
 "Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing," p. 194, new edition.

                               Notes
    1. "It was from hours spent with God that He came forth,
morning by morning, to bring the light of heaven to men. The
disciples had come to connect His hours of prayer with the
power of His words and works. Now, as they listened to His
supplication, their hearts were awed and humbled. As He
ceased praying, it was with a conviction of their own deep
need that they exclaimed, 'Lord, teach us to pray.' "—
"Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing," p. 152, new edition.
    2. "The early morning often found Him [Jesus] in some
secluded place, meditating, searching the Scriptures, or in
prayer."—"Ministry of Healing," p. 52.
    3. "Upon coming up out of the water, Jesus bowed in
prayer on the river bank. . . . The Saviour's glance seems
to penetrate heaven as He pours out His soul in prayer.. Well
He knows how sin has hardened the hearts of men, and how
difficult it will be for them to discern His mission, and accept
the gift of salvation. He pleads with the Father for power
to overcome their unbelief, to break the fetters with which
Satan has enthralled them, and in their behalf to conquer the
destroyer.. He asks for the witness that God accepts humanity
in the person of His Son.
    "Never before have the angels listened to such a prayer.
They are eager to bear to their loved Commander a message
of assurance and comfort. But no; the Father Himself will
answer the-petition of His Son. Direct from the throne issue
the beams of His glory. The heavens are opened, and upon
the Saviour's head descends a dovelike,form of purest light,—
fit emblem of Him, the meek and lowly One."—"The Desire of
Ages," pp. 111, 112.
     4. Prayer and the reception of the Spirit go together. The
Lord will never pour out His Spirit in an abundant measure
upon a prayerless soul.
     5. "The Saviour's promise to the disciples was now ful-
filled. Upon the mount the future kingdom of glory was
 represented in miniature,— Christ the King, Moses a repre-
sentative of the risen saints, and Elijah of the translated ones."
 —"The Desire of Ages," p. 422.
24          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

    6. "We should pray in the family circle; and above All we
must not neglect secret prayer; for this is the life of the
soul. It is impossible for the soul to flourish while prayer is
neglected. Family or public prayer alone is not sufficient.
In solitude let the soul be laid open to the inspecting eye of
God. Secret prayer is to be heard only by the prayer-hearing
God. No curious ear is to receive the burden of such petitions.
In secret prayer the soul is free from surrounding influences,
free from excitement. Calmly, yet fervently, will it reach out
after God. Sweet and abiding will be the influence emanating
from Him who seeth in secret, whose ear is open to hear
the prayer arising from the heart."—"Steps to Christ,"
pp. 102, 103.
    7. "The disciples prayed that greater strength might be im-
parted to them in the work of the ministry; for they saw that
they would meet the same determined opposition that Christ
had encountered when upon the earth. While their united
prayers were ascending in faith to heaven, the answer came.
The place where they were assembled was shaken, and they
were endowed anew with the Holy Spirit. Their hearts filled
with courage, they again went forth to proclaim the Word of
God in Jerusalem. 'With great power gave the apostles wit-
ness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus,' and God mar-
velously blessed their efforts."—"The Acts of the Apostles,"
pp. 67, 68.
    8. "The darkness of the evil one incloses those who neglect
to pray. The whispered temptations of the enemy entice them
to sin; and it is because they do not make use of the privileges
that God has given them in the divine appointment of prayer.
Why should the sons and daughters of God be reluctant to
pray, when prayer is the key in the hand of faith to unlock
heaven's storehouse, where are treasured the boundless re-
sources of Omnipotence? Without unceasing prayer and
diligent watching, we are in danger of growing careless and
of deviating from the right path."—"Steps to Christ,"
pp. 98, 99.
    "The victory is not won without much earnest prayer,
without the humbling of self at every step."—"Thoughts from
the Mount of Blessing," p. 204, new edition.



   "It is impossible to estimate the good results of one hour
or even half an hour each day devoted in a cheerful, social
manner to the Word of GOd."— Mrs. E. G. White, in "Testi-
monies on Sabbath School Work."

                           Notes
   1. "Then press your petition to the Father in the name of
Jesus. God will honor that name. . . . When we come to
Him confessing our unworthiness and sin, He has pledged
Himself to give heed to our cry. The honor of His throne is
staked for the fulfillment of His word unto us."-"Christ's
Object Lessons," p. 148.
   "To pray in the name of Jesus is something more than a
mere mention of that name at the beginning and the ending
of a prayer. It is to pray in the mind and spirit of Jesus,
while we believe His promises, rely upon His grace, and work
His works."-"Steps to Christ," p. 105.
   2. "Both in public and in private worship, it is our privi-
lege to bow on our knees before God when we offer our peti-
tions to Him."-"Prophets and Kings," p. 48.
   3. "Moses discerned ground for hope where there appeared
only discouragement and wrath. The words of God, `Let Me
alone,' he understood not to forbid but to encourage inter-
cession, implying that nothing but the prayers of Moses could
save Israel; but that if thus entreated, God would spare His
people."-"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 318.
   4. "As Moses interceded for Israel, his timidity was lost
in his deep interest and love for those for whom he had, in
the hands of God, been the means of doing so much. The
Lord listened to his pleadings, and granted his unselfish
prayer."- Id., p. 319.
   5. We should not fail to note that when Israel was in-
volved in a terrible crisis, Hezekiah sent to the prophet of
           SABBATH SCHOOL. LESSON QUARTERLY                27

God to inquire if he had any instruction for them. And the
Lord had not forgotten His people; He sent them a message
of hope. What a worthy example is here presented before
us by Hezekiah! He took the threatening letter of the king,
and "spread it before the Lord." When in trouble and almost
overwhelmed with difficulty, we too can obtain help by bring-
ing it to the Lord, and earnestly seeking Him for help.
    6. "Faith such as this is needed in the world to-day,—
faith that will lay hold on the promises of God's Word, and '
refuse to let go until Heaven hears. Faith such as this con-
nects us closely with Heaven, and brings us strength for cop-
ing with the powers of darkness."—"Prophets and Kings,"
p. 157.
    7. Though we may fall under the dominion of death, be
poverty-stricken and comparatively unknown; though there
may be no flowers upon the bier, if there are those mourning
our death whom, while living, we helped when in need, those
who can tell of our unselfish almsgiving and deeds of kind-
ness, the obsequies will be grander than those of the potentates
of earth.
    8. "The same angel who had come from the royal courts
to rescue Peter, had been the messenger of wrath and judg-
ment to Herod. The angel smote Peter to arouse him from
slumber: it was with a different stroke that he smote the
wicked king, laying low his pride, and bringing upon him the
punishment of the Almighty. Herod died in great agony of
mind and body, under the retributive judgment of God. . . .
    "We need to understand better than we do the mission of
the angels. It would be well to remember that every true
child of God has the cooperation of heavenly beings. Invisible
armies of light and power attend the meek and lowly ones
who believe and claim the promises of God. Cherubim and
seraphim, and angels that excel in strength, stand at God's
right hand, 'all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for
them who shall be heirs of salvation.' "—"The Acts of the
Apostles," pp. 152, 154.
    9. 1 Peter 3: 7 seems to indicate that unkindness and lack
of love and affection in the home will hinder our prayers from
being answered. Kind words will lighten the cares of the
day. A Christian home where kindness and sympathy reign
is indeed a haven of rest. "It may be humble, unpretentious,
exhibiting no signs of material wealth; but there is the wealth
of mutual affection which fire can not consume, and no com-
 mercial disaster lessen or destroy, and this is home — the
 home of the heart, the home of childhood, the elysium of riper
 years, the refuge of age." God will hear the prayers which
 ascend from such a home.

                              Notes
    1. "Where anxiety begins faith ends, where faith begins
anxiety ends."—Muller..
    "It is faith that connects us with heaven, and brings us
strength for coping with the powers of darkness. In Christ,
God has provided means for subduing every sinful trait, and
resisting every temptation, however strong."—"The Desire of
Ages," p. 428.
    2. "As you come to Him, believe that He accepts you, be-
cause He has promised. You can never perish while you do
this — never."—"Ministry of Healing," p. 66.
    "Faith can endure trial, resist temptation, bear up under
disappointment."— Id., p. 488.
    3. "In the estimation of the rabbis, it was the sum of
religion to be always in a bustle of activity. They depended
upon some outward performance to show their superior piety.
Thus they separated their souls from God, and built them-
selves up in self-sufficiency. The same dangers still exist.
As activity increases, and men become successful in doing any
work for God, there is danger of trusting to human plans and
methods. There is a tendency ,to pray less, and to have less
faith."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 862.
    4. "Many hold faith as an opinion. Saving faith is a
transaction, by which those who receive Christ join themselves
in covenant relation with God. Genuine faith is life.. A
living faith means an increase of vigor, a confiding trust, by
which the soul becomes a conquering power."— Id., p. 347.
    5. "God reaches for the hand of faith in us to direct it to
lay fast hold upon the divinity of Christ, that we may attain
to perfection of character."—Id., p. 123.
    "As Jesus was in human nature, so God means His fol-
lowers to be. In His strength we are to live the life of purity
and nobility which the Saviour lived."—"Ministry of Heal-
ing," p. 426.
    6. "Jesus knows the circumstances of every soul. The
greater the sinner's guilt, the more he needs the Saviour. His
 heart of divine love and sympathy is drawn out most of all
for the one who is the most hopelessly entangled in the snares
30         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

of the enemy. With His own blood He has signed the eman-
cipation papers of the race.
    "Jesus does not desire those who have been purchased at
such a cost to become the sport of the enemy's temptations.
He does not desire us to be overcome and perish. He who
curbed the lions in their den, and walked with His faithful
witnesses amid the fiery flames, is just as ready to work in
our behalf, to subdue every evil in our nature. To-day He is
standing at the altar of mercy, presenting before God the
prayers of those who desire His help. He turns no weeping,
contrite one away. Freely will He pardon all who come to
Him for forgiveness and restoration."— Id., pp. 89, 90.
    7. "The• Lord Jesus is making experiments on human
hearts through the exhibition of His mercy and abundant
grace. He is effecting transformations so amazing that
Satan with all his triumphant boasting, with all his confeder-
acy of evil united against God and the laws of His govern-
ment, stands viewing them as a fortress impregnable to his
sophistries and delusions. They are to him an incompre-
hensible mystery. The angels of God, seraphim and cherubim,
the powers commissioned to cooperate with human agencies,
look on with astonishment and joy, that fallen men, once
children of wrath, are through the training of Christ develop-
ing characters after the divine similitude, to be sons and
daughters of God, to act an important part in the occupations
and pleasures of heaven."— Mrs. E. G. White, in "General
Conference Bulletin," 1893, p. 409.
    8. "Our Redeemer has opened the way, so that the most
sinful, the most needy, the most oppressed and despised, may
find access to the Father."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 113.
    9. Victory is, not received• "by works of righteousness
which we have done," but is wholly the gift of God, received
by faith. Till we believe that God will give us the victory
personally, we can never receive it. There can be no victory
without faith.
   "Only surrendered persons are victorious; but not all sur-
rendered persons are victorious. 'Surrender' means turning
ourselves wholly, utterly over to God, to let Him do anything
and everything that He pleases with us. To be victorious is to
have Christ supreme in our life; and of course He can not be
supreme there while we continue to hold on to anything our-
selves. Therefore it is that so much emphasis is properly
put upon the 'surrendered' life, the 'yielded' life. But some
make the mistake of thinking that this surrender, this yield-
ing, is all there is to it; and they find that they are not
victorious, and wonder why. The answer is simple: surrender
or yielding is only our part; the victory is Christ's part; and
until we believe that He is doing His part in us in perfect
              SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                             31

completeness, victory can not be ours. So, after letting go of
our own lives that Christ may be supreme in us, we must then
say that we know that He is now working the whole miracle
of our victory. And we must know it or else say, consciously
or unconsciously, that Christ is false; for He pledges to us
His word, 'My grace is sufficient for thee.' So this is the
last secret of victory: . . . that Christ is now our complete
victory. That is why the victorious life is better than merely
the yielded life; for yielding is our part, but victory is God's
part; and His part is always bigger and better than ours."
- Trumbull.

      John 7:37, 38. Note 9.

                             Notes
    1. "The effort to earn salvation by one's own works, in-
evitably leads men to pile up human exactions as a barrier
against sin. For, seeing that they fail to keep the law, they
will devise rules and regulations of their own to force them-
selves to obey. All this turns the mind away from God to
self. His love dies out of the heart, and with it perishes love
for their fellow men. A system of human invention, with its
multitudinous exactions, will lead its advocates to judge all
who come short of the prescribed human standard. The at-
mosphere of selfish and narrow criticism stifles the noble and
generous emotions, and causes men to become self-centered
judges and petty spies.
    "The Pharisees were of this class. They came forth from
their religious services, not humbled with a sense of their
own weakness, not grateful for the great privileges that God
had given them. They came forth filled with spiritual pride,
and their theme was, 'Myself, my feelings, my knowledge, my
ways.' Their own attainments became the standard by which
they judged others. Putting on the robes of self-dignity, they
mounted the judgment seat, to criticize and condemn."-
"Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing," •pp. 177, 178, new
edition.
   2. "There is no limit to the usefulness of one who, by
putting self aside, makes room for the working of the. Holy
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                 33

Spirit upon his heart, and lives a life wholly consecrated to•
God."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 250.
    3. "The omnipotent power of the Holy Spirit is the de-
fense of every contrite soul. Not one that in penitence and
faith has claimed His protection will Christ permit to pass
under the enemy's power. The Saviour is by the side of His,
tempted and tried ones."— Id., p. 490.
    "Suddenly, as the Spirit comes with more direct appeal,
the soul gladly surrenders itself to Jesus. By many this is
called sudden conversion; but it is the result of long wooing
by the Spirit of God,— a patient, protracted process."—
Id., p. 172.
    4. "There is no safety for one who has merely a legal
religion, a form of godliness. The Christian's life is not a.
modification or improvement of the old, but a transformation
of nature. There is a death to self and sin, and a new life
altogether. This change can be brought about only by the
effectual working of the Holy Spirit."— Ibid.
    5. "In the great and measureless gift of the Holy Spirit
are contained all of heaven's resources. It is not because of
any restriction on the part of God that the riches of His grace
do not flow earthward to men. If all were willing to receive,
all would become filled with His Spirit."—"Christ's Object
Lessons," p. 419.
    "In all who will submit themselves to the Holy Spirit a new
principle of life is to be implanted; the lost image of God
is to be restored in humanity."— Id., p. 96.
    6. "Wherever there is an impulse of love and sympathy,
wherever the heart reaches out to bless and uplift others,
there is revealed the working of God's Holy Spirit. In the
depths of heathenism, men who have had no knowledge of the
written law of God, who have never even heard the name of
 Christ, have been kind to His servants, protecting them at the
 risk of their own lives. Their acts show the working of a
 divine power. The Holy Spirit has implanted the grace of
 Christ in the heart of the savage, quickening his sympathies
 contrary to his nature, contrary to his education. The 'Light
 which lighteth every man that cometh into the world,' is
 shining in his soul ; and this light, if heeded, will guide his
 feet to the kingdom of God."— Id., p. 385.
     7. "Christ's act in cursing the tree which His own power
 had created, stands as a warning to all churches and to all
 Christians. No one can live the law of God without minis-
 tering to others. But there are many who do not live out
 Christ's merciful, unselfish life. Some who think themselves
 excellent Christians do not understand what constitutes serv-
 ice for God. They plan and study to please themselves. They
 act only in reference to self. Time is of value to them only
34            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

as they can gather for themselves. In all the affairs of life
this is their object. Not for others but for themselves do
they minister. God created them to live in a world where un-
selfish service must be performed. He designed them to help
their fellow men in every possible way. But self is so large
that they can not see anything else. They are not in touch
with humanity. Those who thus live for self are like the
fig tree, which made every pretension, but was fruitless.
They observe the forms of worship, but without repentance or
faith. In profession they honor the law of God, but obedience
is lacking. They say, but do not. In the sentence pronounced
on the fig tree Christ demonstrates how hateful in His eyes is
this vain pretense. He declares that the open sinner is less
guilty than is he who professes to serve God, but who bears
no fruit to His glory."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 581.
    8. "I heard those clothed with the armor speak forth the
truth in great power. It had effect. I saw those who had
been bound; some wives had been bound by their husbands,
and some children had been bound by their parents. The
honest who had been held or prevented from hearing the truth,
now eagerly laid hold of it. All fear of their relatives was
gone. The truth alone was exalted to them. It was dearer
and more precious than life. They had been hungering and
thirsting for truth. I asked what had made this great change.
An angel answered, 'It is the latter rain, the refreshing from
the presence of the Lord, the loud cry of the third angel.' "
—"Testimonies," vol. 1, pp. 182, 188.
    9. "The cry of Christ to the thirsty soul is still going
forth, and it appeals to us with even greater power than to
those who heard it in the temple on that last day of the feast.
The fountain is open for all. The weary and exhausted ones
are offered the refreshing draught of eternal life."—"The
Desire of Ages," p. 454.

      Isa. 1: 18 ; Jer. 3: 22, 23.
                           Notes
   1. "No repentance is genuine that does not work reforma-
tion. The righteousness of Christ is not a cloak to cover un-
confessed and unforsaken sin; it is a principle of life that
 36          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

  transforms the character and controls the conduct. Holiness
  is wholeness for God; it is the entire surrender of heart and
  life to the indwelling of the principles of heaven."—"The
  Desire of Ages," p. 555.
      2. Repentance is not simply:
      a. Fear. In a storm at sea, when all seems lost, passen-
  gers may be filled with fear, yet not repent of sin.
      b. Feeling. A convict may feel very sorry, not because
  of the enormity of his sin, but because he has been caught, and
  must be punished for his crimes.
      c. Bodily Affliction. We may fast, or punish our bodies,
  even give ourselves to be burned, yet not repent.
      d. Remorse. Judas had such remorse that he committed
  suicide, but he did not truly repent of his sin.
      e. Conviction of Sin. Many are under continual condem-
  nation and conviction of sin, and feel they should repent of
  sin by turning away from it; but because they love sin, they
  refuse to abandon it.
      f. Praying. We may pray, and yet cling to that which
  is evil, and refuse to repent.
      g. Stopping Some Sin. A drunkard may "brace up," and
  stop drinking or using profane language, and yet not really
  repent of his sins.
      3. True repentance is a turning away from sin, a sur-
  render of that which is wrong, a facing in an opposite direc-
  tion, a yielding wholly and unreservedly to the dictates of the
  Holy Spirit. It means a reformation of life.
      4. "Not by its name, but by its fruit, is the value of a tree
  determined. If the fruit is worthless, the name can not save
  the tree from destruction. John declared to the Jews that
  their standing before God was to be decided by their character
  and life. Profession was worthless. If their life and character
  were not in harmony with God's law, they were not His
  people. . . .
      "All who became the subjects of Christ's kingdom, he said,
  would give evidence of faith and repentance. Kindness,
  honesty, and fidelity would be seen in their lives. They would
  minister to the needy, and bring their offerings to God. They
  would shield the defenseless, and give an example of virtue
  and compassion. So the followers of Christ will give evidence
  of the transforming power of the Holy Spirit. In the daily
  life, justice, mercy, and the love of God, will be seen. Other-
  wise they are like the chaff, that is given to the fire."—"The
  Desire of Ages," p. 107.
      5. "The arguments of the apostles alone, though clear and
' convincing, would not have removed the prejudice that had
  withstood so much evidence. But the Holy Spirit sent the
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  37
arguments home to hearts with divine power. The words of
the apostles were as sharp arrows of the Almighty, convict-
ing men of their terrible guilt in rejecting and crucifying the
Lord of glory."—"The Acts of the Apostles," P. 45.
    6. "As Jonah entered the city, he began at once to 'cry
against' it the message, 'Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be
overthrown.' From street to street e went, sounding the
note of warning.
    "The message was not in vain. The cry that rang through
the streets of the godless city was passed from lip to lip, until
all the inhabitants had heard the startling announcement.
The Spirit of God pressed the message home to every heart,
and caused multitudes to tremble because of their sins, and to
repent in deep humiliation."—"Prophets and Kings," p. 270.
     7. "One of Christ's last commands to His disciples was,
`Love one another as I have loved you.' Do we obey this
command, or are we indulging sharp, unchristlike traits of
character? If we have in any way grieved or wounded others,
it is our duty to confess our fault, and seek for reconciliation.
This is an essential preparation that we may come before God
in faith, to ask His blessing."—"Christ's Object Lessons,"
p. 144.                                                   •
    8. "The gospel makes no compromise with evil. It can
not excuse sin. Secret sins are to be confessed in secret to
 God; but for open sin, open confession is required."—"The
Desire of Ages,' p. 811.
     9. "The love of God still yearns over the one who has
chosen to separate from Him, and He sets in operation in-
 fluences to bring him back to the Father's house. The prodi-
 gal son in his wretchedness 'came to himself.' The deceptive
 power that Satan had exercised over him was broken. He
 saw that his suffering was the result of his own folly, and
 he said, 'How many hired servants of my father's have bread
 enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger! I will arise
 and go to my father.' Miserable as he was, the prodigal found
 hope in the conviction of his father's love. It was that love
 which was drawing him toward home. So it is the assurance
 of God's love that constrains the sinner to return to God.
 `The goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance.' A golden
 chain, the mercy and compassion of divine love, is passed
 around every imperiled soul. The Lord declares, 'I have
 loved thee with- an everlasting love; therefore with loving-
 kindness have I drawn thee. "—"Christ's Object Lessons,"
 p. 202.
     10. "We can not even repent without the aid of the Spirit
 of God. . . . Repentance comes from Christ as truly as does
 pardon."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 175.

                                Notes
    1. "Before the foundations of the earth were laid, the
Father and the Son had united in a covenant to redeem man
if he should be overcome by Satan. They had clasped Their
hands in a solemn pledge that Christ should become the surety
for the human race. This pledge Christ has fulfilled. When
upon the cross He cried out, 'It is finished,' He addressed the
Father. The compact had been fully carried out. Now He
declares, `Father, it is finished. I have done Thy will, 0 My
God. I have completed the work of redemption. If Thy jus-
tice is satisfied, "I will that they also, whom Thou hast given
Me, be with Me where I am."' "—"The Desire of Ages," p. 834.
    2. That will indeed be a great hour in the .experience of
God's people when the dead in Christ and the living righteous
are "caught up together." "Angels 'gather together the elect
from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.'
Little children are borne by holy angels to their mothers' arms.
Friends long separated by death are united, nevermore to
part, and with songs of gladness ascend together to the city
of God."—"The Great Controversy," p. 645.
    3. "Soon I heard the voice of God which shook the heavens
and the earth. There was a mighty earthquake. Buildings
 were shaken down, and fell. on every side. I then heard a
triumphant shout of victory, loud, musical, and clear. I
 looked upon this company, who, a short time before, were in
 such distress and bondage. Their captivity was turned. A
 glorious light shone upon them. How beautiful they then
 looked! All weariness and marks of care were gone; health
 and beauty were seen in every countenance. Their enemies,
 the heathen around them, fell like dead men. They could not
 endure the light that shone upon the delivered, holy ones. This
 light and glory remained upon them until Jesus was seen in
 the clouds of heaven, and the faithful, tried company were
 changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, from glory to
glory."—"Testimonies," vol. 1, p. 184.
    4. "I saw that many were neglecting the preparation so
needful, and were looking to the time of 'refreshing' and the
`latter rain' to fit them to stand in the day of the Lord, and
to live in His sight. Oh, how many I saw in the time of
trouble without a shelter! They had neglected the needful
40           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
 preparation, therefore they could not receive the refreshing
 that all must have to fit them to live in the sight of a holy
 God. Those who refuse to be hewed by the prophets and fail
 to purify their souls in obeying the whole truth, and who are
 willing to believe that their condition is far better than it
 really is, will come up to the time of the falling of the plagues,
 and then see that they needed to be hewed• and squared for the
 building. But there will be no time then to do it and no
 Mediator to plead their cause before the Father."—"Early
 Writings," p. 71.
     5. "Pray in your closet; and as you go about your daily
 labor, let your heart be often uplifted to God. It was thus
 that Enoch walked with God."—"Steps to Christ," p. 103.
     6. "Elijah was a type of the saints who will be living on
 the earth at the time of the second advent of Christ, and who
 will be 'changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at
the last trump,' without tasting of death. It was as a repre-
 sentative of those who shall be thus translated, that Elijah,
 near the close of Christ's earthly ministry, was permitted to
stand with Moses by the side of the Saviour on the mount of
transfiguration. In these glorified ones, the disciples saw in
miniature a representation of the kingdom of the redeemed.
 They beheld Jesus clothed with the light of heaven; they
heard the 'voice out of the cloud,' acknowledging Him as the
Son of God; they saw Moses, representing those who will be
 raised from the dead at the time of the second advent; and
there also stood Elijah, representing those who at the close
of earth's history will be changed from mortal to immortal,
and be translated to heaven without seeing death."—"Proph-
ets and Kings," p. 227.
    7. "All heaven was waiting to welcome the Saviour to the
celestial courts. As He ascended, He led the way, and the
multitude of captives set free at His resurrection followed.
The heavenly host, with shouts and acclamations of praise and
celestial song, attended the joyous train. . .
    "Then the portals of the city of God are opened wide, and
the angelic throng sweep through the gates amid a burst of
rapturous music.
    "There is the throne, and around it the rainbow of promise.
There are cherubim and seraphim. The commanders of the
angel hosts, the sons of God, the representatives of the un-
fallen worlds, are assembled. The heavenly council before
which Lucifer had accused God and His Son, the representa-
tives of those sinless realms over which Satan had thought to
establish his dominion,— all are there to welcome the Re-
deemer. They are eager to celebrate His triumph and to
glorify their King."—"The Desire of Ages," pp. 833, 834.
