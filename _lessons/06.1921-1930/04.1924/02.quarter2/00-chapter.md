        Note 7.
                              Notes
    1. Isaac Leeser's Jewish translation of Jer. 29: 11 reads,
"For I alone know the thoughts that I entertain respecting
you, saith the Lord; thoughts of peace, and, not of evil, to
give you a happy future and hope."
    From all eternity God's plan and thought toward man
has been to make man infinitely happy. Every act and pur-
pose of the Creator has been with this end-in view. Prov.
5: 21.
    2. The first beautiful home of man came fresh from the
hand of the Creator, with "every tree that is pleasant to the
sight, and good for food." The beautiful flowers, fruits, and
trees were without a taint of decay. There was no note of
discord in the songs of praise that went up to God in that
happy home. It is far beyond the power of man to describe,
for not until Eden is restored, and the curse of sin removed,
will we know its glory.
    3. "God might have created man without the power to
transgress His law; He might have withheld the hand of
Adam from touching the forbidden fruit; but in that case
man would have been, not a free moral agent, but a mere
automaton. Without freedom of choice, his obedience would
not have been voluntary, but forced. There could have been
no development of character. Such a course would have been
contrary to God's plan in dealing with the inhabitants of
other worlds. It would have been unworthy of man as an
intelligent being, and would have sustained Satan's charge of
God's arbitrary ru."—"Patriarchs and. Prophets," p. 49.
    4. "Our first parents, though, created innocent and. holy,
were not placed beyond the possibility of wrong-doing. God
made them free moral agents.:. . . They were to enjoy com-
munion with God and with holy angels; but before they could
             SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                              5

be rendered eternally secure, their loyalty must be tested. . . .
God placed man under law, as an indispensable condition of his
very existence. . . . He endowed him with high intellectual
powers, and presented before him the strongest possible
inducements to be true to his allegiance. Obedience, perfect
and perpetual, was the condition of eternal happiness."—
Id., pp. 48, 49.
    5. The gospel of Christ is based upon principles as en-
during as the plan for the continuance of the universe of God.
No sooner had our first parents transgressed than Christ
made known to Adam that He would die in his stead. The
unmerited grace was provided in Christ before man existed
(2 Tim. 1:9). The penalty for disobedience was the for-
feiture of life (Gen. 2: 17), but Christ stepped into the place
of the condemned. In doing this the Substitute assumed all
that was imposed upon the transgressor by the royal mandate.
    6. "Many claim that it was impossible for Christ to be
overcome by temptation. Then He could not have been placed
in Adam's position; He could not have gained the victory that
Adam failed to gain. If we have in any sense a more trying
conflict than had Christ, then He would not be able to succor
us. But our Saviour took humanity, with all its liabilities.
He took the nature of man, with the possibility of yielding to
temptation. We have nothing to bear which He has not en-
dured."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 117.
    7. "Those who believe the truth should remember that they
are God's little children,—that they are under His training.
Let them be thankful to God for His manifold mercies, and be
kind to one another. They have one God and one Saviour;
and one Spirit — the Spirit of Christ — is to bring unity into
their ranks."—"Testimonies," vol. 9, p. 189.

            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    7

                             Notes
    1. When God created the earth, He gave man dominion
over all except one tree, which He reserved to Himself. In
reserving to Himself this tree, the Lord made it a test of
man's loyalty to God. So long as Adam and Eve heeded the
command, "Thou shalt not eat of it," God's ownership re-
mained unchallenged, and man showed his loyalty to his
Creator. Upon man's fidelity to this divine principle of own-
ership, or his disregard of the same, depended the weal or
woe of the human race; therefore God tested our first parents
in Eden upon this fundamental principle of God's government.
    2. A steward is one placed in charge of another's property,
and he is held strictly responsible to the owner as to its use in
every particular. The responsibility placed upon Christ's
stewards embraces the numerous gifts or blessings bestowed
upon His servants, to be accounted for at the final day of
judgment. The Lord blesses man in a thousand ways, that
he may be a blessing to others. See Gen. 12: 2. Often the
Lord withholds His blessings because man will not use them
in harmony with the mind of the Giver.
    3. Speaking of the last mighty struggle which Satan
makes for supremacy when the city of God descends from
heaven, the servant of the Lord says:
    "The wicked are Satan's captives. In rejecting Christ
they have accepted the rule of the rebel leader. They are
ready to receive his suggestions and to do his bidding. Yet,
true to his early cunning, he does not acknowledge himself
to be Satan. He claims to be the Prince who is the rightful
owner of the world, and whose inheritance has been unlaw-
fully wrested from him."—"The Great Controversy," p. 663.
     Our faithfulness as stewards of Christ's goods will de-
termine whether we acknowledge Christ as supreme owner of
this world, or whether we yield to Satan's claims of ownership.
     4. "Every Christian is a steward of God, entrusted with
 His goods. . . . A steward identifies himself with his master.
 He accepts the responsibilities of a steward, and he must act
in his master's stead, doing as his master would do were he
presiding. His master's interests become his. The position
 of a steward is one of dignity, because his master trusts him."
 —"Testimonies," vol. 9, p. 246.
     The faithful steward through whom God disperses abroad
 His gifts to those in darkness will cause thanksgiving to be
 rendered to God from redeemed lips throughout the ceaseless
 ages of eternity.

   The Thirteenth Sabbath overflow will go to Japan and
Korea in addition to the appropriation voted to these fields.
Shall not the overflow be a liberal one? The fields are needy.

                            Notes
    1. Isaac Leeser's Jewish translation reads (Ps. 111: 4),
"He hath made a memorial of His wonderful works." Rother-
ham's translation reads the same as Leeser's. The Lord has
established memorials to keep His greatest acts ever in mind.
This is a method common to many nations and people. Some-
times a city or state erects a monument of stone in memory
of a great man. The George Washington Monument at Wash-
ington, D. C., is an example of this kind of memorial. The
setting apart of a day of remembrance is an impressive me-
morial of some great accomplishment; for example, the annual
celebration of July 4, in the United States, commemorates
the signing of the Declaration! of Independence; and now
nearly all the leading nations celebrate November 11 as Ar-
mistice Day in memory of the signing of the armistice which
ended the greatest war known in history.
    2. "The tithing system reaches back beyond the days of
Moses. Men were required to offer to God gifts for religious
purposes before the definite system was given to Moses, even
as far back as the days of Adam. In complying with God's
requirements, they were to manifest in offerings their appre-
ciation of His mercies and blessings to them. This was con-
tinued through successive generations, and was carried out
by Abraham, who gave tithes to Melchisedec, the priest of the
most high God."—"Testimonies " vol. 3, p. 393.
    "As to the amount required,' God has specified one tenth
of the increase. This is left to the conscience and benevolence
of men, whose judgment in this tithing system should have
free play. And while it is left free to the conscience, a plan
has been laid out definite enough for all. No compulsion is
required. . . . He says, I give you nine tenths, while I require
one tenth; that is Mine. When men withhold the one tenth,
they rob God."— Id., p. 394.
    "Whenever God's people, in any period of the world, have
cheerfully and willingly carried out His plan in systematic
benevolence and in gifts and offerings, they have realized the
 standing promise that prosperity should attend all their la-
bors just in proportion as they obeyed His requirements. . . .
 But when they robbed God in tithes and in offerings, they
 were made to realize that they were not only robbing Him
 but themselves; for He limited His blessings to them, just
 in proportion as they limited their offerings to Him."— Id.;
 p. 395.
     3. "Jacob set up a memorial of God's mercy, that when-
 ever he should pass that way, he might tarry at this sacred
spot to worship the Lord. And he called the place Bethel, or
 `the house of God.' With deep gratitude he repeated the
10          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

promise that God's presence would be with him; and then he
made the solemn vow. . . .
    "Jacob was not here seeking to make terms with God. ,
The Lord had already promised him prosperity, and this vow
was the outflow of a heart filled with gratitude for the assur-
ance of God's love and mercy. . . . The Christian should of-
ten review his past life, and recall with gratitude the precious
deliverances that God has wrought for him, supporting him in
trial, opening ways before him when all seemed dark and
forbidding, refreshing him when ready to faint. He should
recognize all of them as evidences of the watchcare of
heavenly angels. In view of these innumerable blessings he
should often ask, with subdued and grateful heart, 'What shall
I render unto the Lord for all His benefits toward me?' [Ps.
116: 12.]
    "Our time, our talents, our property, should be sacredly
devoted to Him who has given us these blessings in trust. . .
As we are continually receiving the blessings of God, so we
are to be continually giving.
    " 'Of all that Thou shalt give me,' said Jacob, 'I will surely
give the tenth unto Thee.' Shall we who enjoy the full light
and privileges of the gospel, be content to give less to God
than was given by those who lived in the former, less favored
dispensation? Nay, as the blessings we enjoy are greater,
are not our obligations correspondingly increased? But how
small the estimate; how vain the endeavor to measure with
mathematical rules, time, money, and love, against a love
so immeasurable and a gift of such inconceivable worth.
Tithes for Christ! 0, meager pittance, shameful recompense
for that which cost so much!"—"Patriarchs and Prophets,"
pp. 187, 188.
    4. When we pay our tithe in grateful recognition of God's
ownership and our stewardship, we find that the very act of
paying tithe quickens our love and devotion to our blessed
Lord. See Eph. 1: 13, 14; 1 Cor. 15: 49.
    "True Christian benevolence springs from the principle of
grateful love. . . . Redeeming love should awaken all the ten-
der affection and self-sacrificing devotion that can possibly
exist in the heart of man."—"Testimonies," vol. 3, p. 396.
   •"The system of tithes and offerings was intended to im-
 press the minds of men with a great truth,— that God is
 the source of every blessing to His creatures, and that to
 Him man's gratitude is due for the good gifts of His provi-
 dence. . . .
    "Thus the people were constantly reminded that God was
 the true proprietor of their fields, their flocks and herds; that
He sent them sunshine and rain for their seedtime and harvest,
 and that everything they possessed was of His creation, and
              SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                            11

He had made them stewards of His goods."- Mrs. E. G.
White, in "Review and Herald," Sept. 10, 1889.
   5. In returning to God that portion of all their income
which the Lord has reserved for the support of His ambassa-
dors, each individual is brought into very close partnership
with Christ in the work of carrying the gospel to a perishing
world. Christ commissions men to preach the gospel. In
the tithe He has provided the means to support His chosen
messengers.

      just as he led man to disregard God's ownership by
      partaking of the forbidden tree in Eden? 2 Cor. 11: 3,
      4, 7, 8; 12: 13. Note 5.

16. What earnest charge is given them? 2 Tim. 4: 1, 2.
                             Notes
     1. Note the very forceful questions which the apostle asks
 in 1 Cor. 9: 7-11. These can be answered only in one way.
  The apostle refers to the ministers of the temple and how
 they received their support from the holy things of the temple,
 then makes the emphatic statement, "Even so hath the Lord
 ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of
 the gospel." Even so, in like manner, God has ordained, ap-
 pointed, decreed, that the gospel minister should be supported
 by the tithe. Christ has thus set apart the tithe for the sup-
 port of His ambassadors.
     2. The true shepherd will not only feed the sheep and
 lambs with the precious things of God, but he will help the
 lame and tender of the flock, putting forth extra efforts for
.any who are wandering away from the fold. He will be un-
 tiring and unselfish in his labors. He will be an example to
 the flock. He will guard the treasury of the Lord, and will be
 unwilling to draw from it the tithe for his support, unless he
 has demonstrated that he is entitled to such support by bring-
 ing many precious souls to Christ. 1 Cor. 9: 1, 2. The
 slothful, ease-loving, unfruitful shepherd will have an awful
 account to give in the day of final reckoning. The blood of
 precious souls will be required at his hand. Eze. 33: 6.
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  13
     3. The Pharisees were very particular in the matter of
tithing. They had been faithful in this, but had utterly neg-
lected to exercise the virtues of justice, mercy, and faith.
Jesus said to them in effect, You "ought" to have cherished
these precious virtues, but you ought "not to leave the other
[tithe-paying] undone." "Ought" is a strong word, carrying
the meaning of moral obligation.
     4. The position and offices given by the inspired Word to
the, ministry as a whole, carry the gravest responsibilities,
and show the confidence Christ placed in these servants who
labor under His great commission. Some of these names or
titles are: elders, bishops, ministers, ambassadors, priests,
Levites, messengers, apostles, pastors, evangelists, teachers,
shepherds, servants, overseers, watchmen, and prophets. Who
can conceive of a nation sending a messenger, or appointing
an ambassador to represent it, and not providing for the
support of this representative? Much more does Christ, by
 reserving the tithe, provide the means to sustain His own
servants. When we withhold our tithe, we not only rob
 Christ, but we rob the dying people of this world of the mes-
sage of life, for this is heaven's appointed way of sending the
gospel to a perishing world.
     5. The apostle acknowledges to the Corinthian church that
he did them a wrong in not impressing upon them the duty of
supporting the Lord's ambassadors and acknowledging God's
ownership; and he asks them to forgive him this wrong.
     "Of the tree of knowledge of good and evil they were not
to eat. This tree God reserved as a constant reminder of. His
 ownership of all. . . .
     "So it is with God's claims upon us. He places His
treasures in the hands of humanity, but requires that one
tenth shall be faithfully laid aside for His work. He teaches
 us the lesson that He requires this portion to be placed in
 His treasury. It is to be rendered to Him as His own; it is
sacred, and is to be used for sacred purposes, for the support
 of those who carry the message of salvation to all parts of the
world. He reserves this portion, that means may ever be
flowing into His treasure house, and that the light of truth
may be carried to those who are nigh and those who are afar
 off. By faithfully obeying this requirement, we prove that we
 realize that all belongs to God. . . .
     "And shall not our gratitude offerings flow into the Lord's
treasury, to be drawn therefrom to advance His kingdom in
the earth? God is the owner of all our goods, and shall not
 gratitude to Him prompt us to make freewill' offerings and
thank offerings, thus acknowledging His ownership of soul,
body, spirit, and property?"—"Special Testimonies for Min-
isters," No. 9, pp. 69, 70.

                           Notes
  1. "Sin originated with him who, next to Christ, had been
most honored of God, and who stood highest in power and
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                 15

glciry among the inhabitants of heaven. Before his fall, Luci-
fer was first of the covering cherubs, holy and undefiled. . .
Instead of seeking to make God supreme in the affections and
allegiance of His creatures, it was Lucifer's endeavor to win
their service and homage to himself. And, coveting the honor
which the infinite Father had bestowed upon His Son, this
prince of angels aspired to power which it was the prerogative
of Christ alone to wield."—"The Great Controversy," pp.
493, 494. In view of the cost of sin which originated in the
heart through coveting, it is no wonder that God abhors
this sin.
    2. "Thou shalt not covet" is a law that relates to the con-
dition of the mind, and precedes the act of outward transgres-
sion of the other nine commandments. The violation of this
commandment can not be detected by man, except as it leads
to the outward violation of some one of the other command-
ments. The tenth commandment, if kept, is a protection
against breaking the other nine commandments or the com-
mitting of sin.
    3. "I saw that Satan bade his angels lay their snares es-
pecially for those who were looking for Christ's second ap-
pearing." To his angels he said: "Go, make the possessors of
lands and money drunk with cares. If you can make them
place their affections upon these things, we shall have them
yet. They may profess what they please, only make them care
more for money than for the success of Christ's kingdom or
the spread of the truths we hate. Present the world before
them in the most attractive light, that they may love and
idolize it. We must keep in our ranks all the means of which
we can gain control. The more means the followers of Christ
devote to His service, the more will they injure our kingdom
by getting our subjects. As they appoint meetings in different
places, we are in danger. Be very vigilant then. Cause dis-
turbance and confusion if possible. Destroy love for one an-
other. Discourage and dishearten their ministers; for we
hate them. Present every plausible excuse to those who have
means, lest they hand it out. Control the money matters if
you can, and drive their ministers to want and distress. This
will weaken their courage and zeal. Battle every inch of
ground. Make covetousness and love of earthly treasures
the ruling traits of their character. As long as these traits
rule, salvation and grace stand back. Crowd every attraction
around them and they will be surely ours. And not only are
we sure of them, but their hateful influence will not be ex-
ercised to lead others to heaven. When any shall attempt to
give, put within them a grudging disposition, that it may be
sparingly."—"Early Writings,' pp. 266, 267.

                             Notes
    1. From the very nature of God's laws, happiness can exist
and endure only as God's created intelligences comply with
righteous principles which are inseparable from the great
underlying principles of God's government. Hence the curse
is in disobedience and not merely an arbitrary judgment
of God.
    2. In every transaction in which we engage, with every-
thing coming into our possession from any source, we are to
keep in mind the Giver by setting apart one tenth of all our
income in memory of the price that has been paid for us by
our Redeemer. Like the Sabbath, the tithe is holy (Isa. 58:
13; Lev. 27: 30), and it is reserved by Christ for a holy
purpose. Neither belongs to man. We may expect that as
God calls for a return of His people to keep these ordinances
in mind, there will be opposition and persecution.
    3. The tithe is reserved by Christ to support His ambassa-
dors. The Lord's arrangement for the distribution of the
tithe to His servants is in harmony with equity and justice to
all. Anciently they had "storehouses" to which the tithe was
brought, and distributed by those chosen for that purpose.
We learn from the text that they had "treasurers over the
treasuries," who were responsible for the proper distribution
of the tithe. This corresponds to the plan of the conference
treasurer receiving the tithe from the church treasurer, and
distributing it to the laborers by action of an auditing com-
mittee. This safeguards these sacred funds and provides for
a just distribution. All should pay their tithe to their church
treasurer, and he in turn should send it to the conference
treasurer each month.
     "The tithe is sacred, reserved by God for Himself. It is
 to be brought into His treasury to be used to sustain the
 gospel laborers in their work. For a long time the Lord has
 been robbed because there are those who do not realize that
the tithe is God's reserved portion.
     "Some have been dissatisfied, and have said, 'I will not
 longer pay my tithe; for I have no confidence in the way
 things are managed at the heart of the work.' But will you
 rob God because you think the management of the work is not
 right? Make your complaint, plainly and openly, in the right
 spirit, to the proper ones. Send in your petitions for things
 to be adjusted and set in order; but do not withdraw from
 the work of God, and prove unfaithful, because others are
 not doing right.
     "Read carefully the third chapter of Malachi and see what
 God says about the tithe. If our churches will take their
 stand upon the Lord's word, and be faithful in paying their
 tithe into His treasury, more laborers will be encouraged to
18            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

take up ministerial work. More men would give themselves
to the ministry were they not told of the depleted treasury.
There should be an abundant supply in the Lord's treasury,
and there would be if selfish hearts and hands had not with-
held the tithes, or made use of them to support other lines of
work. "Testimonies," vol. 9, p. 2.49.
    4. Satan has always sought to turn man away from the
observance of the divine ordinances of Sabbath-keeping and
tithe-paying. The reformation in Moses' time called especial
attention to the Sabbath and the tithe. In Nehemiah's time
we see the same departure. Neh. 13: 15-19; 5: 10-14. Again
in the last days Sabbath-keeping and tithe-paying are gener-
ally disregarded. Isa. 56: 1, 2; 58: 12, 13; Rev. 12: 17; 14:
6-12; Mal. 3: 6-12. By these great ordinances we' keep in
mind the Creator, and our blessed Redeemer; hence Satan's
opposition to them.

       sin will be theirs who will be ready to meet Christ in
       joy? Zeph. 2: 1-3; Jer. 50: 20. Note 4.
                             Notes
   1. We talk about the new earth, with its restored Edenic
glory, as an inheritance promised the saints. We picture our
homes in the beautiful renewed earth, but we say little about
the inheritance Christ is to have in the saints. The law of
just recompense gives to Christ an inheritance which He will
exhibit through all eternity to unfallen worlds, as a reward of
the travail of His soul. He says, "Israel Mine inheritance,"
"the Lord's portion is His people; Jacob is the lot of His in-
heritance." This inheritance will far exceed all other glory
and honor bestowed upon Christ by a united and grateful uni-
verse.
    2. Sinful man, pictured with no soundness in him, and as
corrupt and vile, was once in the likeness of God,— pure, in-
nocent, noble. He was made "a little lower than the angels;"
and though fallen so low, he is to be redeemed in soul, mind,
character, and person, lifted out of the mire of sin, and exalted
above the angels in glory.

   3. "The Lord is testing and proving His people. If any
have no heart in the work, and fail to bring their offerings to
God, He will visit them; and if they continue to cling to
their covetousness, He will separate them from His people."-
"Testimonies," vol. 1, p. 238.
    4. "Oh, how many I saw in the time of trouble without a
shelter! They had neglected the needful preparation, there-
fore they could not receive the refreshing that all must have to
fit them to live in the sight of a holy God. Those who refuse
to be hewed by the prophets, and fail to purify their souls in
obeying the whole truth, and who are willing to believe that
their condition is far better than it really is, will come up to
the time of the falling of the plagues, and then see that they
needed to be hewed and squared for the building. . . . I saw
that none could share the 'refreshing,' unless they obtain the
victory over every besetment, over pride, selfishness, love of
the world, and over every wrong word and action. . . . Let
all remember that God is holy, and that none but holy beings
can ever dwell in His presence."-"Early Writings," p. 71.

                             Notes
    1. The American Revised Version of Phil. 3: 20, 21 reads,
"For our citizenship is in heaven; whence also we wait for a
Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ: who shall fashion anew the
body of our humiliation, that it may be conformed to the
body of His glory, according to the working whereby He is
able even to subject all things unto Himself."
    2. When Christ shall look upon the redeemed multitudes
that have been lifted out of sin, degradation, and death, and
transformed into the likeness of God, and when it is said that
they "have washed their robes, and made them white in the
blood of the Lamb," He will then come into possession of the
riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints. He will
feel that the sacrifice on His part has not been too great, and
He will then be satisfied.
    3. In the Revised Version, Titus 2: 14 reads, "who
[Christ] gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from
all iniquity, and purify unto Himself a people for His own
possession." Christ says of those who have been faithful in
all Christian duties, "They shall be Mine, saith the Lord of
hosts, in that day when I make up My jewels." These are His
people — His glorious possession, purified and glorified, and
22          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

possessing the moral and visible image of their Redeemer.
This inheritance will far exceed all other glory and honor that
can be bestowed upon Christ.
    4. The adoration of the entire universe is drawn to Christ
as they behold Him glorified in His saints, and see that Christ
in His character and person is duplicated in all who have
believed. In other words, they see and admire Christ in
character and in person in every redeemed saint. This is
the greatest glory possible for Christ to receive. This is
Christ's inheritance in His saints.
    5. "The Lord has given me a view of other worlds. Wings
were given me, and an angel attended me from the city to a
place that was bright and glorious. The grass of the place
was living green, and the birds there warbled a sweet song.
The inhabitants of the place were of all sizes; they were noble,
majestic, and lovely. They bore the express image of Jesus,
and their countenances beamed with holy joy, expressive of
the freedom and happiness of the place. I asked one of them
why they were so much more lovely than those on the earth.
The reply was, 'We have lived in strict obedience to the com-
mandments of God, and have not fallen by disobedience, like
those on the earth.' Then I saw two trees, one looked much
like the tree of life in the city. The fruit of both looked
beautiful, but of one they could not eat. They had power to
eat of both, but were forbidden to eat of one. Then my at-
tending angel said to me, 'None in this place have tasted of
the forbidden tree; but if they should eat, they would fall.'
Then I was taken to a world which had seven moons. There I
saw good old Enoch, who had been translated. On his right
arm he bore a glorious palm, and on each leaf was written
`Victory.' . . . I asked him if this was the place he was taken
to from the earth. He said, 'It is not; the city is my home,
and I have come to visit this place.' "—"Early Writings," pp.
39, 40.
    6. If Enoch and those who have been translated or resur-
rected from the dead (Matt. 27: 52; Eph. 4: 8, margin; Rev.
4: 4; 5: 8-10), such as the four and twenty elders associated
with Christ's priesthood, are permitted to visit other worlds,
that have not fallen, certainly the saints in the ages to come
will have that privilege and behold the wonderful works of
God. Eph. 2: 6, 7.
    "All the treasures of the universe will be open to the study
of God's redeemed. Unfettered by mortality, they wing their
tireless flight to worlds afar,— worlds that thrilled with sor-
row at the spectacle of human woe, and rang with songs of
gladness at the tidings of a ransomed soul. With unutterable
delight the children of earth enter into the joy and the wisdom
of unfallen beings. They share the treasures of knowledge
and understanding gained through ages upon ages in con-
              SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                             23

templation of God's handiwork. With undimmed vision they
gaze upon the glory of creation,- suns and stars and systems,
all in their appointed order circling the throne of Deity."-
"The Great Controversy," pp. 677, 678.

                            Notes
    1. "It is a maxim from heaven, 'Honor the Lord with thy
substance.' He who has a religion that costs him nothing,
 has a religion that is worth nothing. . . . Had Araunah's
noble offer been accepted, it would have been Araunah's sac-
rifice, not David's; nor would it have answered the end of
turning away the displeasure of the Most High. It was David
that sinned, not Araunah; therefore, David must offer sacri-
fice, and at his own expense too."— Dr. Adam Clarke. God
showed His approval by answering David's prayer by fire
from heaven.
    2. Mount Moriah: Supposed to be the same place where
Abraham was about to offer his son Isaac. It is said that
"Solomon began to build the house of the sanctuary of the
Lord at Jerusalem, in the place where Abraham had prayed
and worshiped in the name of the Lord. This is the place
of the earth where all generations shall worship the Lord.
Here Abraham was about to offer his son Isaac for a burnt
offering; but he was snatched away by the word of the Lord,
and a ram placed in his stead. . . . Here the angel of the
Lord appeared to David, at which time David built an altar
unto the Lord in the threshing-floor which he bought from
Araunah, the Jebusite."— Id.
   "The destroying angel had stayed his course outside Jeru-
salem. He stood upon Mount Moriah, 'in the threshing floor
of Oxman [Araunah] the Jebusite.' . . .
   "The spot upon which the altar was erected, henceforth
ever to be regarded as holy ground, was tendered to the king
by Oman [Araunah] as a gift. But the king declined thus to
receive it. 'I will verily buy it for the full price,' he said;
`for I will not take that which is thine for the Lord, nor offer
burnt offerings without cost. So David gave to Ornan for the
place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.' This spot,
memorable as the place where Abraham had built the altar to
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                 25
offer up - his son, and now hallowed by this great deliverance,
was afterward chosen as the site of the temple erected by
Solomon."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 748, 749.
    3. "As the place of His ascension, Jesus chose the spot so
often hallowed by His presence while He dwelt among men.
Not Mount Zion, the place of David's city, not Mount Moriah,
the temple site, was to be thus honored. There Christ had
been mocked and rejected. There the waves of mercy, still
returning in a stronger tide of love, had been beaten back by
hearts as hard as rock. Thence Jesus, weary and heart-
burdened, had gone forth to find rest in the Mount of Olives.
The holy shekinah, in departing from the first temple, had
stood upon the eastern mountain, as if loth to forsake the
chosen city; so Christ stood upon Olivet, with yearning heart
overlooking Jerusalem. The groves and glens of the mountain
had been consecrated by His prayers and tears. Its steeps
had echoed the triumphant shouts of the multitude that pro-
claimed Him king. On its sloping descent He had found a
home with Lazarus at Bethany. In the garden of Gethsemane
at its foot He had prayed and agonized alone. From this
mountain He was to ascend to heaven. Upon its summit His
feet will rest when He shall come again."—"The Desire of
Ages," pp. 829, 830.
    4. "Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth,
is Mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great
King." Let us review some of the great events that have
taken place on the mountains in and near Jerusalem. It is.
clear from Mark 13: 1-3, that the place where the temple
was built, Mount Moriah, was near the wall inside of old Je-
rusalem, while Mount Olivet was outside the city, not far
away. See 2 Chron. 3: 1. On Mount Moriah Abraham offered
up Isaac. Here David made his great offering to God. Here
the temple was built. Here great numbers of animals were
offered in sacrifice, typical of the death of Christ. Near to
this place Christ suffered in the garden of Gethsemane, at the
foot of Mount Olivet, and near this place Christ died. Prom
Mount Olivet Christ ascended to heaven and gave His parting
blessing and promise of the Holy Ghost to His church. At the
end of the millennium, Christ will descend, "and His feet shall
stand in that day upon the Mount of Olives, which is before
Jerusalem on the east, and the Mount of Olives shall cleave in
the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west, and
there shall be a very great valley; and half of the mountain
shall remove toward the north, and half of it toward the
south." Zech. 14: 4. Here the throne of universal dominion
will be with men forever and ever. How appropriate is the
place and the call, "Gather My saints together unto Me; those
that have made a covenant with Me by sacrifice." Ps. 50: 5.

      saving the lost? Rom. 8: 32, 17. Note 6.
                              Notes
     1. For many years the Sabbath school offerings have been
given for mission work, and these gifts have helped materially
in establishing our work in all parts of the world. At the
present time the Sabbath schools alone support about one half
the mission work carried on by our Mission Board.
     2. Order is one of the first laws of heaven. This is seen
in all of God's works and requirements. There should be sys-
tem in giving, as well as in all our habits of life. On the
matter of regular, systematic giving, very clear instruction
has been given:
     "The spiritual health and prosperity of the church is de-
pendent in a great degree upon her systematic benevolence.
It is like the lifeblood which must flow through the whole
being, vitalizing every member of the body."—"Testimonies,"
vol. 3, p. 405.
     3. Each day of the week the continual burnt offering was
one lamb offered in the morning and one lamb in the evening.
On the Sabbath there were two lambs for a burnt offering,
besides the continual burnt offering, making four lambs, or
twice the offering on the Sabbath that was given on other
days of the week. Eze. 46: 4 shows that the prince was to
offer six lambs on the Sabbath, or three times the number of-
fered any other day. This shows that the Sabbath day was a
day for large offerings to God.
     4. "The work of God, which should be going forward with
tenfold its present strength and efficiency, is kept back, like
a spring season held by the chilling blast of winter, because
some of God's professed people are appropriating to them-
selves the means that should be dedicated to His service. Be-
cause Christ's self-sacrificing love is not interwoven in the
life practices, the church is weak where it should be strong.
 By its own course it has put out its light, and robbed millions
 [of souls] of the gospel of Christ. . .
     "To defraud God is the greatest crime of which man can
be guilty; and yet this sin is deep and widespread. Through
 the prophet Malachi, God says: Will a man rob God? Yet
 ye have robbed Me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed
 Thee? In tithes and offerings. Ye are cursed with a curse:
 for ye have robbed Me, even this whole nation. Bring ye all
 the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in Mine
 house, and prove Me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts,
 if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and-pour you
28            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive
it.' These are the words of God, who speaks, and it is. Shall
we not hear His voice? Shall we not change the order of
things, and cooperate with Christ?"- Mrs. E. G. White, in
"Review and Herald," Oct. 13, 1896.
     5. One has said, "All I give away to help some soul, I keep;
and all I keep, I lose." When we behold the ineffable glory of
God resting upon those we have had some part in leading to
Christ by the sacrifices we have made, our joy will be com-
plete and eternal.
     6. We are laborers together with God, and not only are
given the privilege of laboring with Him for the lost, but will
be sharers in the final joy and reward. Matt. 25: 21.

                             Notes
   1. "In His word, God has committed to men• the knowledge
necessary for salvation. The Holy Scriptures are to be ac-
cepted as an authoritative, infailible revelation of His will.
They are the standard of character, the revealer of doctrines,
and the test of experience. . . . The Scriptures explicitly
state that the word of God is the standard by which all teach-
ing and experience must be tested."—"The Great Contro-
versy," Introduction, p. v11.
   "The disciples were to teach what Christ had taught. That
which He had spoken, not only in person, but through all the
prophets and teachers of the Old Testament, is here included.
Human teaching is shut out. There is no place for tradition,
for man's theories and conclusions, or for church legislation.
No laws ordained by ecclesiastical authority are included in
the commission. None of these are Christ's servants to teach.
`The law and the prophets,' with the record of His own words
and deeds, are the treasure committed to the disciples to?be
given to the world. Christ's name is their watchword, their
badge of distinction, their bond of union, the authority for
their course of action, and the source of their success. Noth-
ing that does not bear His superscription is to be recognized
in His kingdom."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 826.
    2. "The angel who unites in the proclamation of the third
angel's message, is to lighten the whole earth with his glory.
30          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

A work of world-wide extent and unwonted power is here fore-
told. . . .
    "The work will be similar to that of the day of Pentecost.
As the 'former rain' was given, in the outpouring of the Holy
Spirit at the opening of the gospel, to cause the upspringing
of the precious seed, so the 'latter rain' will be given at its
close, for the ripening of the harvest. . . . The prophecies
which were fulfilled in the outpouring of the former rain at
the opening of the gospel, are again to be fulfilled in the latter
rain at its close. Here are the times of refreshing' to which
the apostle Peter looked forward when he said, 'Repent ye
therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted
out [in the investigative judgment], when the times of re-
freshing shall come from the presence of the Lord; and He
shall send Jesus.'
    "Servants of God, with their faces lighted up and shin-
ing with holy consecration, will hasten from place to place to
proclaim the message from heaven. By thousands of voices,
all over the earth, the warning will be given. Miracles will be
wrought, the sick will be healed, and signs and wonders will
follow the believers. Satan also works with lying wonders,
even bringing down fire from heaven in the sight of men.
Thus the inhabitants of the earth will be brought to take their
stand. . .
    "Now the rays of light penetrate everywhere, the truth
is seen in its clearness, and the honest children of God sever
the bands which have held them. Family connections, church
relations, are powerless to stay them now. Truth is more
precious than all besides. Notwithstanding the agencies com-
bined against the truth, a large number take their stand upon
the Lord's side—"The Great Controversy," pp. 610-612.
    3. "I have graven thee upon the palms of My hands,"
Christ says, in Isa.. 49: 16. "It cost something to engrave
them there. It cost untold agony. If•we would humble our-
selves before God, and be kind and courteous and tender-
hearted and pitiful, there would be one hundred conversions
to the truth where now there is- only one. But, though pro-
fessing to be converted, we carry around with us a bundle of
self that we regard as altogether too precious to be given up.
It is our privilege to lay this burden at the feet of Christ, and
in its place take the character and similitude of Christ. The
Saviour is waiting for us to do this."—"Testimonies," vol. 9,
pp. 189, 190.
    This must be done before God can trust us with a large out-
pouring of His Spirit. As individuals and as a people, we
should seek God to this end, and we shall receive the baptism
of the Holy Spirit for service.

                          JUNE 21, 1924
   LESSON    HELP:    "Our Story of Missions," by W. A. Spicer.


       Lessons 12 and 13 of this series are a departure from the plan of
   each lesson being purely a study of Holy Scripture. This line of
   thought logically follows the lesson of last week. Since ours is a
   missionary movement as expansive as the world, and a fulfillment of
   prophecy, the real value of these missionary lessons will be recognized
   by all. It must be remembered, however, that statistics of a grow.
   ing work are more or less out of date when they reach the reader.
   Those used in these lessons are the latest obtainable at the time the
   lessons were written.

                             Notes
    1. The second coming of Christ had been preached by
William Miller and by thousands of believers in America and
other parts of the world prior to 1844. That year brought
also the rise of a people keeping the commandments of God
and the faith of Jesus, who soon began to go to the world with
the message of the prophecy. How the Sabbath truth came
to the knowledge of believers in the approaching second ad-
vent is told in the "History of the Sabbath":
32         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

    "A faithful Seventh-day Baptist sister, Mrs. Rachel D.
Preston, moved from New York State to Washington, N. H.
Here she became interested in the doctrine of the glorious
advent of Christ near at hand. Being instructed in this sub-
ject by the Adventist people, she in turn taught them of the
claims of the law of God, so that as early as 1844 nearly the
entire church at Washington, N. H., which consisted of about
forty persons, became observers of the Sabbath of the Lord,
and then and there the first Seventh-day Adventist church in
the world was organized. This church exists to this day.
Wonderful to say, also in 1844 some Adventists in Southern
Germany, convinced from studying the Bible, began to keep
the true Sabbath."— P. 778.
     Captain Joseph Bates received the Sabbath truth from this
church in Washington, N. H., and began to proclaim the new-
found light on Rev. 14: 6-14, both by preaching and by print-
ing a tract on the true Sabbath. In 1846 a publication was
circulated on the sanctuary, showing that Christ's work as
high priest in the second apartment of the sanctuary in heaven
began in the autumn of 1844, and that the cleansing of this
sanctuary was the work of the investigative judgment (Rev.
14: 6) in heaven. James White and Miss Ellen Harmon
 (later Mrs. E. G. White), J. N. Andrews, J. N. Loughborough,
Uriah Smith, and J. H. Waggoner were among, the pioneers
to accept the Sabbath and the new light on the sanctuary.
     Elder James White led in the work of organization and
in the publishing work. Mrs. E. G. White gave valuable
counsel, especially in the establishment of publishing, educa-
tional, and medical institutions. North America has been the
source of the greatest number of our laborers, and the means
to support the advancing work all over the world.
     Number of, church members in 1921 in North America,
98,715. Amount of tithe and offerings in North America in
1921, $6,686,054.62. Per capita, $67.73.
               •            Europe
   2. After nearly twenty-five years of steady advancement of
the message in North America, the spirit to lengthen our cords
and strengthen our stakes (Isa. 54: 2, 3) in more active mis-
sionary effort in lands across the sea, took new form and
shape. On Sept. 14, 1874, Elder J. N. Andrews, our first mis-
sionary sent across the sea, sailed for Europe. In a letter
written soon after he landed, and printed in the Review and
Herald, Nov. 17, 1874, he writes:
    "I have sought the blessing of God continually in coming
hither, that I might be prepared to work for God. And since
our arrival I have cried to Him to fit me to labor here with
acceptance and success. . . . But I did not come to please
myself, and I trust, with God's help, that I shall be able to
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                 33

be faithful to the work even though it shall be, as in America,
attended with pain. I firmly believe that God has much people
in Europe who are ready to obey His holy law, and to rever-
ence His Sabbath, and to wait for His Son from heaven. I
came here to give my life to the proclamation of-these sacred
truths concerning the near advent of Christ and the observ-
ance of God's commandments. I hope to walk circumspectly,
and not to count my life dear to myself."
     This letter is a typical one, and breathes the spirit of
thousands of our beloved laborers who have gone abroad since
1874. Other pioneers in that field were J. N. Loughborough,
William Ings, A. A. John, Jennie Thayer, J. H. Durland, M. C.
Wilcox, J. G. Matteson, B. L. Whitney, L. R. Conradi, H. P.
Holser, 0. A. Olsen, J. H. Waggoner, J. T. Boettcher, and
many others have followed in later years.
     The number of members in the European Division in 1921
was 58,635.. The amount of tithe and offerings contributed in
1921 represents $653,838.65. Per capita, $11.15.
     The scourge of the World War affected the growing work
in Europe, especially in matters of finance. With the almost
prostrated condition of finances in large portions of Europe,
it is a source of great encouragement that the work is moving
forward, and that the entire division of the European field
could average $11.15 per capita. Surely the spirit of sacrifice
is among this people.
                            Australia
     3. In 1874 Sister E. G. White said that she had been
shown that a work should be done in Australia similar to that
which had been accomplished in America. But not till 1885
were steps taken to send missionaries to Australia. In that
year Elders S. N. Haskell, J. 0. Corliss, M. C. Israel, H. L.
Scott (a printer), and William Arnold (a colporteur), sailed
for Sydney, Australia.
     In 1886 Elder A. G. Daniells and wife entered New Zea-
land, and the work there was permanently established. Mrs.
E. G. White and her son, W. C. White, spent nearly ten years
in the Australian field, assisting in establishing institutions
and in general labor.
     In 1886 John I. Tay, a godly layman, worked his way as
ship carpenter to Tahiti, Society Islands, and from there he
went to Pitcairn Island. In a short time he was enabled to
see the entire population of the island accept the Sabbath and
kindred truths of the third angel's message.
     In 1888 the Sabbath schools raised the money to build a
ship or sailing boat, which was named "The Pitcairn." This
vessel sailed through the Golden Gate Oct. 20, 1890, for Pit-
cairn Island, and for use in the South Sea Islands. On board,
 besides the captain, were Elders E. H. Gates, A. J. Read, John
 I. Tay, and their wives.
34          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

    A large work has been done among the Pacific islands, the
following islands having been entered:
    Eastern Polynesia: Pitcairn Island, Society group, Cook
group, Paumotus, Marquesas.
    Central Polynesia: Fiji Islands, Samoa, Tonga, Niue.
    Melanesia: Solomon Islands, New Hebrides.
    The large island of New Guinea, Norfolk Island, Lord
Howe Island.
    Many faithful laborers have gone to that field to give their
service, and many of the native-born people of Australia and
New Zealand have shown great ability in the work.
    In 1921 the membership of the Australasian Division was
8,436. Every department of the cause has been strongly de-
veloped in the division. Their total contributions to the work,
tithes and offerings, were $553,762.83. This was $65.64 per
capita, being almost as much for each member as was given
in North America.
                             Africa
    4. In 1886 G. J. Van Druten and Peter Wessels, of the
diamond fields of South Africa, had, through the study of the
Scriptures, begun the observance of the Sabbath. Learning,
by means of a paper that had fallen into their hands, that
there were Christian Adventist Sabbath keepers in America,
they sent to the General Conference $250 to help bear the
traveling expenses of a minister to South Africa. The Gen-
eral Conference responded by sending Elders D. A. Robinson
and C. L. Boyd. Later F. L. Mead, R. C. Porter, I. J. Hankins,
W. H. Anderson, W. S. Hyatt, W. B. White, and others from
North America, have labored in South Africa.
    In 1921 the membership in Africa was 3,411. The total
tithes and offerings were $109,582.67. The amount per capita
was $32.13. A large number of native students are in our
mission schools. The work is moving forward, and a gain is
made each year.
                       South America
    5. Our work began in South America with the coming of
some Seventh-day Adventist farmers from Kansas in 1888.
George Riffel, the leader of this party of Russian-German
brethren, had lived in Argentina before receiving this mes-
sage in Kansas.
    "Happy in his new-found faith, he desired to take the glad
news to his former neighbors. The Lord had a surprise in
store for these brethren as they came to Argentina. A
Russian-German who had heard the truth in Russia, and been
convinced of it, but who had not obeyed, had recently settled
in Argentina. Apparently by accident, he met the brethren
from Kansas at the river port of Diamante, and though they
were strangers, he offered them the hospitality of his humble
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  35

home. This was on a Friday. The next day he kept the Sab-
bath with the brethren. For many years Brother Hetze
served as one of our most earnest and efficient elders."— A b-
breviated from "Review and Herald," Aug. 12, 1920, p. 6.
    In 1894 Elder F. H. Westphal went out to Argentina to
begin the proclamation of the message in that great con-
tinent. Elder J. Vuilleumier, J. A. Leland, N. Z. Town, E. W.
Snyder, J. W. Westphal, Dr. R. H. Habenicht, H. F. Graf,
W. H. Thurston, F. W. Spies, F. L. Perry, and many others
have labored in this field. In recent years a strong work has
grown up among the Inca Indians, near Lake Titicaca. This
had its origin in some magazines given to Chief Manuel
Camacho by persons in Puno, Peru, who previously received
the truth through literature distributed by Elder Edward
Thomann and another brother in 1903. Chief Camacho taught
the message to pupils of a school he conducted at that time
at his home about twenty miles from Puno. As reports
reached Lima, the headquarters of the Peru Mission, different
workers visited Puno and Chief Camacho's home in 1908 and
1909. Later Elder F. A. Stahl began visiting the chief's dis-
trict from La Paz, Bolivia, and in 1911 moved there. As
the interest grew, he established our first central mission sta-
tion at Plateria, near the chief's home.
    From that beginning we have many central stations, and
more than 3,500 baptized members, who show their love to
God by paying tithes and offerings in increasing amounts
each year. The membership of South America in 1921 was
10,169. Offerings in tithes and donations, $198,409.92. Per
capita, $19.51.

                         The Far East
    1. The Far East is the largest in population of any di-
vision of the General Conference. It embraces China, Japan,
Korea, the Philippine Islands, Manchuria, Malaysia, etc. The
entrance of the message into China, the oldest empire, now
a republic, and the largest in population of any country
in the world, was after this manner: Brother A. La Rue, a
ship missionary, had spent years in and around the harbor
of Hongkong. He had sold and distributed books and papers
that had gone to many lands. Among. the believers was Wil-
liam J. Young, who gives the following in the Review and
Herald, Sept. 14, 1905:
    "I first learned of this truth from R. J. Borrowdale, of
Plymouth, England. Later, while in African waters, during
the Boer War, I was on H. M. S. 'Terrible.' After I became
acquainted with the men, I began to talk the truth to some.
Soon we had a Bible class. Our meeting place was at the
electric switchboard, just over the boilers. It was very hot,
yet those men stopped in this place regularly nearly every
night to study the Bible. A number took their stand for the
Sabbath. Arriving at Hongkong, I looked up' Brother La Rue;
and when I found him, I turned over to him the church that
the Lord had used me to form in the big ship, as 'I was leav-
ing for a small boat."
    Our first pioneer missionaries to China were Elder J. N.
Anderson and wife, and Miss Ida Thompson, who began their
work in that large field in 1902. Nearly two years later Drs.
H. W. Miller and Maude Miller, with Drs. A. C. and Bertha
Selmon, Misses Simpson and Erickson, joined the forces in
old China. Many, from our colleges mostly, have followed
these first workers into this populous country. Elder I. H.
 Evans has had charge of our work in the Far East for sev-
eral years.
                 Japan, Kdrea, the Philippines
    2. Japan was first entered by Prof. W. C. Grainger and
wife in 1896, accompanied by T. H. Okohira, a Japanese stu-
 dent of the Healdsburg (California) College, who had become
 a Seventh-day Adventist. The year after the opening of the
 work in Tokyo, a church of thirteen members was organized.
     The work has made good progress in Korea. It was first
 introduced into that country by a Korean who received the
 light while visiting Japan, and took it back 10. Korea. In
1905 W. R. Smith settled in Soonan and Miss Mimi Scharffen-
 berg joined the work, and a school was started. In 1908 Elder
 C. L. Butterfield and Dr. Riley Russell made the following re-
 port:

     "We have in Soonan a small Korean house that cost twenty
 dollars gold, or forty yen; also a small house where women
 and children wait. This has been our dispensary. In the four
 years, we have seen over twenty thousand patients. The
 people know nothing of infection; but in the old heathen idea,
disease is wind in the bones or some other part of the anatomy,
 to be let out by puncturing with needles of all sorts and de-
 grees of uncleanliness."—"Review and Herald," Oct. 9, 1913.
      The Thirteenth Sabbath Offering to be taken this Sabbath
 is to go to Japan and Korea.
      The work in the Philippine Islands was first started, as in
 many other lands, by colporteurs. R. A. Caldwell and J. L.
 McElhany circulated books and papers. The General Confer-
 ence in 1908 sent Elder L. V. Finster into that field. In 1913
his partial report was:
     "Our first year was devoted to study of the Tagalog lan-
guage and getting out some tracts. The second year, we be-
gan cottage meetings, speaking through an interpreter. Soon
there were more calls than I could fill. Later I had a Bible
school, attended by many of the native pastors of Manila. In
1911 we organized our first church, with eighteen members.
Soon after, we pitched our first tent. The tent was crowded
every night for ten weeks at a time. We pitched in three dif-
ferent places, with the same results. One year later our mem-
bership had grown to a hundred, with many more keeping the
Sabbath."—"Bulletin," 1913, p. 180 (abridged).
     In 1921 the entire membership in the Far East is reported
to be 9,740. Amount of funds raised the same year in tithes
and offerings, $111,170.36. This shows the amount per capita
to be $11.40.
                              India
     3. India, with its population of hundreds of millions, was
entered first by the faithful colporteur distributing religious
books. William Lenker and A. T. Stroup, in 1893, sold the
Bible and religious medical books in many of the leading
cities in India. Miss Georgia Burrus, a California Bible
worker, began the study of the Bengali language, preparing
for work among the women of India. Early workers were
Elders D. A. Robinson, Ellery Robinson, Dr. 0. G. Place, and
later, W. A. Spicer, J. L. Shaw, and H. R. Salisbury. Miss
May Taylor was associated with the pioneer missionaries.
Other workers have followed into this vast field, among whom
are Elder H. H. Votaw and wife, G. F. Enoch, E. H. Guilliard,
J. M. Corner, G. W. Pettit, W. W. Quantock, and many others.
     In 1921 Southern Asia is reported to have 1,438 church
members. Funds raised in the field, $40,226.46, making $27.-
97 raised in tithes and offerings per capita.

                           Inter-America
     4. One of the latest organized divisions is called the Inter-
American Division. It comprises the mission fields of the
Bahamas,- Cuba,—Haiti, Porto Rico, Venezuela, Colombia,
Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and Salvador, and the Jamaica,
South Caribbean, and West Caribbean conferences.
     It is interesting to note how the message gained a foot-
hold in the West Indies. A worker in New York. City was
placing bundles of papers on ships, for distribution in foreign
ports. "Not long afterward a woman living near the wharf
in Georgetown, saw a copy of a paper called the Signs of the
Times in a neighbor's house. He told her that a sea captain
had stepped ashore, and scattering a bundle of papers on the
wharf, remarked, 'There, I have fulfilled my promise.' The
neighbor had picked one paper up, and gladly gave it to his
visitor. She read it with eagerness, and began at once to
keep the Sabbath. Others soon joined in Sabbath observance.
After thoroughly studying that treasured paper, it was care-
fully folded, and sent by mail to her sister living in Barbados.
Before it was worn out, several in that place were brought to
the light."— G. F. Enoch, in "Glimpses of the Caribbean"
(abridged).
     George A. King and William Arnold were pioneers in col-
porteur work in various countries in Central America.
     The membership in this field in 1921 was 7,369; tithes and
offerings, $130,501.59. This shows $17.70 per capita. This
is an excellent showing, which is seen in all lands; namely,
that Christ's treasures are trusted in the hands of believers
to supply the needs of the work in all the world.
                        Tithes and Offerings
  , 5. The total amount given in 1921 by the entire church
membership of 198,088, in tithes and offerings, embracing all
parts of the world as reported by the statistical secretary, is
 $8,508,056.19. This is reckoned on the gold basis of United
 States dollars. It represents an average gift of $42.95 for
 every member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in the
 world in 1921. Better than the money are the precious jewels
 won to 'Christ and His truth during the year.
                      Educational Institutions
     6'-We have in our primary schools 27,730 students. There
 are 1.614 teachers in these primary schools. We have 114
 colleges and academies, with 15,103 students in attendance,
 and 1,110 teachers in these higher. schools. All together we
 have 42,833 students in our schools, with 2,724 teachers. The
 aim is to develop workers and laborers in some branch of the
 cause for all these students if possible. At least we give
 them an opportunity to be fitted for service in some branch
 of this growing work.

                         Publishing Houses
     7. We have forty-six publishing houses. They have em-
 ployees numbering 1,040 persons. We publish 148 periodicals
 in the leading languages. Our book and periodical sales for
1920 and 1921 were $10,447,493.41. We are printing and
 publishing our literature in one hundred languages.
                            Sanitariums
     8. We have forty-four sanitariums and treatment rooms,
 and there are about forty private institutions which are doing
 the same kind of work. In these institutions more than
200,000 patients are treated annually. There are 175 phy-
 sicians, with a total of 2,424 employees, connected with these
 institutions. Charity work done during 1921 amounted to
 $112,497.33.
                          Total Investment
     9. The amount reported by the statistical secretary as in-
 vestments in institutions, on a conservative basis, is $30,699,-
461.49.
                 Number of Accredited Workers
     10. According to the statistical report of 1921, we have
1,329 ordained ministers and 938 licensed ministers. We have
1,836 who carry missionary license, or we have a total number,
licensed by the denomination, of 4,103 persons who are giving
all or a large part of their time in the interest of advancing
the message. Besides this, there are 2,201 colporteurs in the
field. We are preaching, printing, and publishing the mes-
sage in one hundred languages, and are adding to the list each
year. Our ministers preach in seventy-nine languages and
dialects in which as yet we are not printing literature. In
1921 we baptized 21,061 believers.
                          Value of Money
    11. "Money is the stored-up energy of the man who earns
it. The dollar that I earn is so much of my life, my mental
and physical powers, myself stored up in a coin. What I do
with that dollar is what I do with myself. As I spend it I
set free so much of the 'treasured energy .which I hold in
trust, and I set it free to go on forever in a right or wrong di-
rection.' No man does any better with himself than he does
with the money- which is the stored potentiality of himself."
—"Stewardship and Missions," p. 80.
    The scriptures referred to in Question 11' of this lesson,
are solemn admonitions. The apostle Paul expresses an en-
couraging thought; namely, that if we have spent time and
energy in the past simply to gratify ourselves in accumulating
worldly treasures which we can not take with us, we may
reclaim time and energy by investing our means in saving
lost, perishing men. We can in this way redeem the years
of stored energy and life we otherwise would lose.
