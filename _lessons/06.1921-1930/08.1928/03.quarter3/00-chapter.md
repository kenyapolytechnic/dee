                   ANNOUNCEMENT
    For a number of years the General Conference Sabbath
School Department has printed in the Lesson Quarterly, in con-
nection with each lesson, "Suggestions for Daily Family Study."
Our purpose in this was to encourage daily study of the lesson
by all members of the family.
   We feel that we have come to the time when the "Suggestions
for Daily Family Study" may be safely discontinued. The prin-
cipal reason for this is our need of the space taken by the "Sug-
gestions," for the full notes that must accompany these lessons
on the book of Isaiah. Further, we hope our Sabbath school
members are so established in the practice of daily lesson study
that they no longer need the help of "Suggestions."
    We sincerely trust that all will continue the Heaven-inspired
plan of spending some time each day with the word of God as
presented in the Sabbath school lessons. The usual recognition
to all those maintaining a perfect record for a quarter or a year
will still be given.
                LESSON 1
 THE TIMES OF.ISAIAH; SPIRITUAL CONDI-
       TIONS; THE CALL OF ISAIAH
                July 7, 1928
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Isaiah 6.
MEMORY VERSE: Isa. 6: 8.
LESSON HELP: "Prophets and Kings," pp. 303-310.
                             INTRODUCTION
     Isaiah has been called the greatest of the Old Testament prophets,
"the king of all prophets." His name signifies "Jehovah is salvation."
Nothing is known of his father beyond the mere fact of his name,
Amoz. Isaiah lived in Jerusalem, and it is concluded that he sprang
from a family of some rank, as he seems to have had easy access to the
king (Isaiah 7), and was on terms of intimacy with the priest (Isa.
8:2). He had two sons. Isa. 7:3 ; 8:3.
     Various authorities state that Isaiah began to prophecy between
the years 759-740 B. C. As his active labors continued more than sixty
years, he must have died some time after 680 B. C., during the reign
of Manasseh. (See "Prophets and Kings," pp. 310, 382.) Tradition
records that he was sawn asunder, to which there may be a reference
in Hebrews 11: 36-38.
                               THE LESSON
      1. During the reign of what four kings did Isaiah prophecy? With
whom do the visions especially deal? Isa. 1: 1.
      NOTE.—The chronology of the time of Isaiah is indicated by the
reign of these kings. Uzziah, also called Azariah (2 Kings 14:21), who
reigned fifty-two years (2 Chron. 26: 3), died about the year 740 B. C.
His son, Jotham, was associated with him on the throne after Uzziah
was stricken with leprosy (2 Chron. 26:21), and reigned sixteen years.
Jotham was followed by Aliaz, who is also said to have reigned sixteen
years. 2 Chron. 28: 1. He again was followed by Hezekiah, who reigned
twenty-nine years. 2 Chron. 29: 1. Manasseh, who followed Hezekiah,
began to reign early in the seventh century, about 699 B. C., and
 reigned fifty-five years. 2 Chron. 33: 1.
      2. What is said of Uzziah's relation to God in the beginning of his
 reign? How long was he prospered? 2 Chron. 26:3-5, 15.
      NOTE.—"The long reign of Uzziah in the land of Judah and Ben-
 jamin was characterized by a prosperity greater than that of any other
 ruler since the death of Solomon, nearly two centuries before. For
 many years the king ruled with discretion. Under the blessing of
 Heaven, his armies regained some of the territory that had been lost
 in former years. Cities were rebuilt and fortified, and the position of
 the nation among the surrounding peoples was greatly strengthened.
 . . . This outward prosperity, however, was not accompanied by a
 corresponding revival of spiritual power. The temple services were con-
 tinued as in former years, and multitudes assembled to worship the
 living God; but pride and formality gradually took the place of humil-
 ity and sincerity."—"Prophets and Kings," pp. 303, 304.
                                    [ 3]
     3. What caused Uzziah's downfall? Relate the story of his trans-
 gression, and the result. Verses 16-21.
     NOTE.—"His heart was lifted up." (Compare Eze. 28:17.)
     The sin that resulted so disastrously to Uzziah was one of presump-
 tion. Neither his exalted position nor his long life of service could be
 pleaded as an excuse for the presumptuous sin by which he marred the
 closing years of his reign, and brought upon himself the judgment of
 Heaven.
     4. What is said of the son of Uzziah? What did he fail to remove?
 What did the people continue to do? 2 Kings 15:32-35.
     NOTE.—"The judgment that befell Uzziah seemed to have a re-
 straining influence on his son. Jotham bore heavy responsibilities dur-
ing the later years of his father's reign, and succeeded to the throne
after Uzziah's death." The "high places" here mentioned in which the
people continued to worship were altars for idolatrous worship. (See
2 Kings 17-32, 33.)
     In trying to serve Jehovah and other gods at the same time, the
Israelites were not unlike many professed Christians to-day. But God
calls this doing "corruptly." 2 Chron. 27:2.
     5. When God called to repentance and weeping, how did the people
respond? Isa. 22:12-14.
     6. In the year that King Uzziah died, what vision came to Isaiah?
Where was the Lord? Isa. 6:1.
     7. What description is given of the seraphim? Where did they
stand? Verse 2.
     NOTE.—The seraphim are an exalted order of angels that stand
above or around the throne. The cherubim are another order, men-
tioned in Ezekiel, chapters 1 and 10. "Suddenly the gate and the inner
veil of the temple seemed to be uplifted or withdrawn, and he [Isaiah]
was permitted to gaze within, upon the holy of holies, where even the
prophet's feet might not enter. There rose up before him a vision of
Jehovah sitting upon a throne high and lifted up, while the train of
His glory filled the temple. On each side of the throne hovered the
seraphim, their faces veiled in adoration, as they ministered before
their Maker, and united in the solemn invocation, 'Holy, holy, holy, is
the Lord of hosts: the whole earth is full of His glory,' until post and
pillar and cedar gate seemed shaken with the sound, and the house was
filled with their tribute of praise."—"Prophets and Kings," p. 307.
     8. What was their constant refrain? Verse 3. (Compare with
Rev. 4: 8.)
    9. How did the tribute of praise affect the very building? With
what was the house filled? Isa. 6: 4. Compare with the experience on
the day of Pentecost. Acts 2:1-4.
     10. How did this view of God's holiness and glory affect the
prophet? Isa. 6:5.
    11. When the prophet realized and cried out that he was undone,
how was help provided? Verse 6.
     12. Where was the coal applied? What was said? Verse 7.
                                    [ 43
    NCTE.—What was the significance of having a live coal touch the
lips? James 3:2. It is "out of the abundance of the heart" that "the
mouth speaketh." Matt. 12:34. It might be well to ask the Lord each
day, "Lord, consecrate these, my lips, this day to Thee."
    13. To what call was Isaiah now ready to respond? Verse 8.
    14. To whom was Isaiah sent? Would the people understand his
message? Why not? Verses 9, 10.
    NOTE.—"It is not God that blinds the eyes of men or hardens their
hearts. He sends them light to correct their errors, and to lead them in
safe paths; it is by the rejection of this light that the eyes are blinded
and the heart hardened."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 322.
    15. As the prophet asks, "How long?" what answer is given?
Verses 11, 12.
    NOTE.—"The evils that had been multiplying for many genera-
tions could not be removed in his day. Throughout his lifetime he
must be a patient, courageous teacher,—a prophet of hope as well as
of doom. The divine purpose finally accomplished, the full fruitage of
his efforts, and of the labors of all God's faithful messengers, would
appear. A remnant should be saved."—"Prophets and Kings," p. 309.
    16. What hope is given the prophet? Verse 13.
    NOTE.—"The Promised Land was not to remain wholly forsaken
forever. . . . This assurance [verse 13] of the final fulfillment of God's
purpose brought courage to the heart of Isaiah."—Id., pp. 309, 310.
    The last of the ten tribes were taken captive in 721 B. C., not many
years after this vision. Jerusalem was taken more than a hundred
years later.

                LESSON 2
  THE REBELLION OF ISRAEL AND ITS RE-
   SULTS; GOD'S CALL TO REPENTANCE
               July 14, 1928
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Isaiah 1.
MEMORY VERSE: Isa. I: 18.
LESSON HELPS: "Patliarchs and Prophets," pp. 634, 635 (new ed., pp. 661,
  662); "Steps to Christ," pp. 26-33, 40, 41; "Prophets and Kings," pp. 599,
  600, 605, 606.
                            INTRODUCTION
    The first chapter of Isaiah is characteristic of the book. It is really
a summary of all Isaiah's teachings. God has a controversy with His
people. He calls heaven and earth to witness the awful fact that re-
bellion has sprung up in His family. God Himself is the plaintiff. His
people are the defendants. The charge is rebellion. The court scene
presented is most solemn. What can the people say in defense? They
have kept up the form of worship, they have brought their sacrifices,
they have made "many prayers;" but all this has been done only as
a matter of form. The Lord is provoked. He is weary of all these
empty forms, and hates them. But instead of pronouncing sentence
                                   [5 l
upon the people, He says: "Come now, and let us reason together, . . .
though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow." How
anxious God's people should be to accept the proffered pardon!
                              THE LESSON
     1. What is God's complaint against His people? Isa. 1:2.
     NOTE.—This scene has been called, "the great arraignment." Surely
 it must be a serious situation when God Himself makes the charge of
-rebellion against His people. "Rebellion originated with Satan, and all
 rebellion against God is directly due to satanic influence."—"Patri-
 archs and Prophets," p. 635. (See 1 Sam. 15:23.)
     2. What impressive illustration does God use to show how low
 Israel has fallen? Verse 3.
     3. How does God speak of His people? What is said of the Holy
 One of Israel? Verse 4.                            •
     NOTE.—What a fearful condition is here portrayed! In contrast
 with this, God is spoken of as "the Holy One of Israel." In vision,
 Isaiah had seen "the Holy One," and had heard the seraphim sing,
 "Holy, holy, holy." That impression never left him. God was to him,
 "holy, holy, holy." Twenty-five times this expression is used by Isaiah,
 and in the Old Testament elsewhere only six times.
     4. How does God express the uselessness of further punishment?
 How completely had the body been afflicted because of their trans-
 gression? Verses 5, 6.
     5. What had befallen their country? What would have taken place
 had there not been "a very small remnant"? Verses 7-9.
     NorE.—"Hearts that respond to the influence of the Holy Spirit
 are the channels through which God's blessing flows. Were those who
 serve God removed from the earth, and His Spirit withdrawn from
 among men, this world would be left to desolation and destruction,
 the fruit of Satan's dominion. Though the wicked know it not, they
 owe even the blessings of this life to the pregnce, in the world, of
 God's people whom they despise and oppress."—"The Desire of Ages,"
 p. 306.
     6. How does God now address the rulers? The people? To what
should they give ear? Verse 10.
     7. By what questions does God try to cause them to consider the
 real purpose
           ,    of sacrifices? How does He speak of their offerings?
 Verses 11, 12.
     8. What definite command does God give with reference to vain •
 oblations? How is incense mentioned? New moons and sabbaths?
Solemn meetings and appointed feasts? Verses 13, 14.
     NCTE.—No form or ceremonies can ever take the place of heart
service. Without Christ, without true repentance, no act is of any value
 in God's sight. Even prayer may become an abomination. Prov. 28:9.
     9. When the people spread forth their hands in prayer, what would
 God do? Why would not God hear their "many prayers"? Verse 15.
     10. What does God exhort them to do? What were they to cease
to do? Verse 16.
                                  [6)
    11. What should they learn? What should be their attitude toward
the oppressed? the fatherless? the widow? Verse 17. (See James 1:27.)
    12. What invitation does God extend? What happy condition fol-
lows the acceptance of this invitation? Verse 18.
    NOTE.—For comment on this verse see "Steps to Christ," pp. 48, 55.
    13. On what conditions does God promise His people the good of
the land? Verse 19.
    14. What attitude on the part of the people will lead to their de-
struction? How sure is this? Verse 20,,
    Non.—"Here are the promises, plain and definite, rich and full;
but they are all upon conditions. If you comply with the conditions,
can you not trust the Lord to fulfill His word? Let these blessed prom-
ises, set in the framework of faith, be placed in memory's halls. Not
one of them will fail. All that God hath spoken, He will do. 'He is
faithful that promised.' "—"Testimonies," Vol. 5, p. 630.
    15. What change had taken place in the city? How are the princes,
or chief men, spoken of? Verses 21-23.
    NOTE.—The city here spoken of is Jerusalem. It had been full
of judgment, and righteousness had lodged in it. But now all was
changed. The chief men had become companions of thieves, and jus-
tice was not to be had. How like conditions in the world to-day!
    16. What will God do to His adversaries? What will He do for
His own people? Verses 24-26.
    17. How shall Zion be redeemed? Verse 27.
    NOTE.—A "very little remnant" will be redeemed. "Her converts"
literally means "those in her who turn." Some will turn, and they will
be redeemed with judgment and with righteousness.
    18. What will happen to transgressors and sinners? Verses 28-31.


               LESSON 3
THE CALL OF THE PEOPLE TO THE HOUSE OF
   JACOB; A CONTROVERSY WITH ZION;
           A REFUGE IN ZION
               July 21, 1928
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Isaiah 2 to 4.
MEMORY VERSE: Isa. 4: 5, 6.
LESSON HELPS: "Prophets and Kings," pp. 323, 324; "Patriarchs and
  Prophets," pp. 101, 102 (new ed., pp. 98, 99).
                            THE LESSON
   1. For what time was this vision given? Where shall the mountain
of the Lord's house be established? Who shall be drawn to it? Isa.
2:1, 2.
  NOTE.—We make a distinction between "the Lord's house" and "the
mountain of the Lord's house." "The Lord's house" is His people. (See
Heb. 3:6.) "The mountain of the Lord's house" here mentioned is
                                [ 71
apparently a religious power of the latter days which exalts itself
to rulership over other powers and to whom the nations of the earth
will give honor. It is a power in which many, even of God's professed
people, are led to put their trust, instead of trusting the Lord.
     These verses can not refer to the time of the setting up of the true
kingdom of God; for when the true kingdom is set up, all others are
broken to pieces together. (See Dan. 2:35.) Here they are not broken
to pieces, but this religious power merely exalts itself over the other
mountains (or "hills"). Hence this power here spoken of does not refer
to God's true people, but to the counterfeit power that will usurp
God's place.
     2. What will many people say? Verse 3.
    NOTE.—"Many people shall go and say." This is not God's saying.
It is not, "Thus saith the Lord," but the people "go and say."
    Compare "all nations shall flow unto it," verse 2, and "many people,"
verse 3, with Revelation 13:3, "all the world," and verse 8, "all that
dwell upon the earth." When the power here mentioned shall be ex-
alted over the kings of the earth,—the other mountains,—we may ex-
pect the whole world to wonder after the beast.
    3. What further will the people say? What will they propose to
do with their swords and spears? What peace plans will they endeavor
to establish? Verses 4, 5.
    NOTE.—Verse 4 has found a remarkable fulfillment in the peace
talk and peace conferences of late years. Many nations, indeed, have
said that they would not lift up the sword against other nations, and
that they would not learn war any more. In contrast with what the
people say, note what God says. Joel 3:9-13. Note also Isa. 8:9, 12.
    4. How does the prophet express God's displeasure with the house
of Jacob? As the result of their idol worship, what will God refuse
to do? Verses 6-9.
    NOTE.—Verse 5 mentions the house of Jacob as the ones addressed
by the "people." Now God expresses His displeasure against those who
say, "Let us go up to the mountain of the Lord" (verse 3), and yet
have their land "full of idols" (verse 8). These people have all that
man's natural heart could desire, yet God has forsaken them (verse 6),
because of their idolatrous bowing and humbling themselves (verse 9),
and He says, "Therefore forgive them not."
    5. How does God rebuke haughtiness and self-exaltation? Verses
10-17.
    NOTE.—When the last .great deception shall - come, the climax is
shown in him who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called
God, or that is worshiped. That power having been brought to view
in Isaiah 2:1-4, God now tells how He regards it.
    6. In the day of the Lord, what will men do? Why do they seek
to hide themselves? Verses 19-21.
    7. What are we counseled to do? Verse 22. _
    NOTE.—God's children had rebelled against Him, had so completely
yielded themselves to the enemy, so debased themselves, that they were
no longer to be accounted more than the breath they breathed. Instead
of relying upon man's leadership, God would have men turn to Him.
                                   [8 )
    8. What did God say He would remove from Judah and Jerusalem?
Who should rule over them? Isa. 3:1-5.
    NOTE.—Before Israel and Judah were taken captive, they suffered
intensely for lack of bread during the straitness of the siege of both
Samaria and Jerusalem. The countryside was also denuded. When the
cities were captured, the leaders were disposed of by their conquerors.
Of the house of Judah under Zedekiah it is written in ".Prophets and
King," pp. 459, 460, "Zedekiah was taken prisoner, and his sons were
slain before his eyes. The king was led away from Jerusalem a cap-
tive, his eyes were put out, and after arriving in Babylon he perished
miserably. . . .
    "Many had escaped the horrors of the long siege, only to perish by
the sword. Of those who still remained, some, notably the chief of the
priests and officers and the princes of the realm, were taken to Baby-
lon and there executed as traitors. Others were carried captive, to live
in servitude." Without leadership, they preyed upon one another; seek-
ing for leaders, but finding none, they have continued to this day a
living testimony to the certainty of God's judgments.
    9. What was the condition of Jerusalem and Judah? What wit-
nessed against them? Verses 8, 9.
    NOTE.—This chapter deals with conditions as they were in the time
of Isaiah. "Only a few short years, and the ten tribes of the kingdom
of Israel were to be scattered among the nations of heathendom. And
in the kingdom of Judah also the outlook was dark. The forces for
good were rapidly diminishing, the forces for evil multiplying."—
"Prophets and Kings," p. 324. As conditions were then, so they are
now. Hence we may confidently apply the principles of this chapter to
this time also. Of them it was said: "The child shall behave himself
proudly against the ancient." Verse 5. Of this time it is written that
the children shall be "disobedient to parents." 2 Tim. 3:2. Their coun-
tenance at that time showed their sin; the marks of dissipation were
upon them. Isa. 3:9. The sins of Sodom are still prevalent. The poor
were oppressed then. Isa. 3 :1.4, 15. So they are now. James 5:1-6.
    10. What controversy does God have with the daughters of Zion?
Verses 16-24.
     NOTE.—"The prophecy of Isaiah 3, was presented before me, as
applying to these last days; and the reproofs are given to the daugh-
ters of Zion who have thought only of appearance and display."—
"Testimonies," Vol. 1, p. 270.
    11. What is said of the men? Verse 25.
     NOTE.—"I was shown that this scripture will be strictly fulfilled."
 —Ibid.
     12. What is said of the women of Isaiah 4:1?
     NOTE.—This text is connected immediately in thought with the
 last verses of the preceding chapter. In its broader prophetic and
spiritual application, we would note that "woman" designates a church.
 Rev. 12:1, 2; 17:3; 19:7-9; 21:9. Apparently these seven women are
 not above reproach. Isa. 4:1, last part. They are desirous of having
a name, but they will eat their own bread and wear their own apparel.
                                   i 9]
We would therefore conclude that these seven women represent the
fallen churches. They do not accept the wedding garment. They will
wear their own apparel. They will not sit down at the feast and feed
on the word of God. That they have rejected. They will eat their own
bread. They want the name, not the person, of Christ. They are Chris-
tians in name only. They want the name of being Christians, but they
will eat and dress as they please. In contrast with these, the true peo-
ple of God are spoken of in the following verses.
    13. How does the prophet speak of the Branch of the Lord? Verse
2. (See also Isa. 11:1; Jer. 23:5; Zech. 3:8; 6:12, 13.) •
    14. What shall they be called who are left in Zion and who remain
in Jerusalem? Verse 3.
    NoTE.—These verses speak of the remnant, they that are left, that
remain, that "are escaped of Israel." Verse 2. The women spoken of
in verse one are not above reproach, but these are holy. They are' writ-
ten among the living in Jerusalem. Moffatt translates it, "entered in
the book of life." In the shaking time, many will be shaken out. Those
that "remain," that are "left," will be holy, every one of them.
    15. How will God accomplish His cleansing work? Verse 4. (See
also John 16:7-11.)
    NoTE.—"The word of the Lord to Israel was, 'I will turn My hand
upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy
tin.' To sin, wherever found, 'our God is a consuming fire.' In all who
submit to His power, the Spirit of God will consume sin. But if men
cling to sin, they become identified with it. Then the glory of God,
which destroys sin, must destroy them."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 107.
    16. What precious promises has God given His people? Verses 5, 6.
    NOTE,—These verses will find their fulfillment in the last great
crisis. "In one of the most beautiful and comforting passages of
Isaiah's prophecy [Isa. 4:5, 6], reference is made to the pillar of cloud
and of fire to represent God's care for His people in the great final
struggle with the powers of evil."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 283.


               LESSON 4
THE VINEYARD; THE SIX WOES; MESSIANIC
       PROPHECIES; THE REMNANT
              July 28, 1928
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Isaiah 5; 7; 10; 11.
MEMORY VERSE: Isa. 9: 6.
LESSON HELPS: "Prophets and Kings," Introductory chapter, pp. 15-22;
  "Christ's Object Lessons," pp. 284-306 (new ed., pp. 287-311).
                          INTRODUCTION
   The first part of the lesson deals with the Lord's vineyard. The
Lord expected His people to bring forth good fruit, but, behold, they
brought forth "wild grapes." Some of these wild grapes are mentioned
                                [ 10 ]
and condemned under the six woes in the latter part of chapter five.
   The other part of the lesson deals with prophecies concerning the
Messiah. He shall be born of a virgin, His name shall be Immanuel,
and Jesse of the house of David shall be His father. The Spirit of
God shall rest upon Him in full measure, and of the increase of His
government and peace there shall be no end.
                              THE LESSON
    1. What did God do for His vineyard? For what did He look?
What was its fruitage? Isa. 5:1, 2.
    NOTE.—"As the Lord's vineyard they were to produce fruit alto-
gether different from that of the heathen nations. These idolatrous
peoples had given themselves up to work wickedness. . . . In marked
contrast was to be the fruit borne on the vine of God's planting.
    "It was the privilege of the Jewish nation to represent the charac-
ter of God as it had been revealed to Moses. In answer to the prayer
of Moses, 'Show me Thy glory,' the Lord promised,           will make all
My goodness pass before thee,' And the Lord passed by before him,
and proclaimed, The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-
suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for
thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin.' This was the
fruit that God desired from His people. In the purity of their charac-
ters, in the holiness of their lives, in their mercy and loving-kindness
and compassion, they were to show that 'the law of the Lord is per-
fect, converting the soul.' "—"Christ's Object Lessons," pp. 285, 286.
(Compare Christ's parable, Matt. 21:33-44. See also Isa. 27:2, 3.)
     2. How does God appeal to the people? Verses 3, 4.
    3. What does God say He will do? Who is the vineyard? What
was the response to God's care? Verses 5-7.
    NOTE.—"God in His Son had been seeking fruit, and had found
none. Israel was a cumberer of the ground. Its very existence was a
curse; for it filled the place in the vineyard that a fruitful tree might
fill. It robbed the world of the blessings that God designed to give.
The Israelites had misrepresented God among the nations. They were
not merely useless, but a decided hindrance. To a great degree their
religion was misleading,. and wrought ruin instead of salvation."—
Id., p. 215.
    4. What does God condemn in the first of the six woes? Verses 8-10.
    NoTE.—"The outlook was particularly discouraging as regards the
social conditions of the' people. In their desire for gain, men were
adding house to house and field to field."—"Prophets and Kings,"
p. 306.
    "Dwell alone in the midst of the land." Verse 8, A. R. V. Having
bought up all the land about them, they would have no near neighbors.
Many houses would be desolate (empty). Verse 9.
     This first woe deals with greediness. Gods punishment is to reduce
the yield. Ordinarily ten acres in those days would yield five hundred
baths, or four thousand gallons. The "ephah" was one-tenth part of
an homer.
     5. What is condemned in the second woe? Verses 11-17.
                                   [11 ]
    NOTE.—Drinking and feasting are here condemned. Men drink
until they "regard not the work of the Lord." The Lord is working,
but drink has stupefied the people. Strong drink has always been a
curse, and is condemned by God.
    6. Against what form of sin is the third woe directed? Verses
18, 19.
    NOTE.—The sin here mentioned is that of open defiance against
God. Isaiah has been warning the people that judgments will come
upon them foi their sins. They scoff at him. "Let Him make speed,"
they say, "and hasten His work, that we may see it." This defiant un-
belief seems to have been common in Isaiah's day. (See Isa. 28:14, 15.)
    7. To whom does the fourth woe apply? Verse 20.
    NOTE.—This verse brings to view a complete confusion of moral
distinctions. Good is evil and evil is good. This lack of understanding
or appreciating moral standards is a sign of deep moral corruption.
The situation to-day is no better than in Isaiah's time.
    8. On whom does the fifth woe descend? Verse 21.
    NOTE.—True wisdom and prudence are gifts from God; but to be
wise in one's own eyes is an abomination to Him.
    9. Against whom is the last woe directed? Verses 22-30.
    NOTE.—This woe is especially directed against the leaders of the
people, the judges "which justify the wicked for reward." In verses
11-17 drunkenness is spoken of as a hindrance to spiritual progress.
Here it is mentioned as a curse and a hindrance to justice. Drunken
judges will "let off guilty men for a bribe, and deprive the innocent
of his rights." Verse 23, Moffatt's translation. (See also Isa. 10:1-4.)
    Note the judgments of God in verse 24. The reason for all this is
that "they have cast away the law of the Lord," and that also they
have "despised the word of the Holy One of Israel." "The law" and
"the word" need to be emphasized at this time. Verses 25-30 deal with
the sure destruction that shall come because of sin.
    10. What sign was given to the house of David when the faithless
King Ahaz had refused to seek a sign? Isa. 7:10-16.
    11. How is the coming Messiah spoken of? Isa. 9:6, 7.
    12. What is said of Christ and His ancestry? Isa. 11:1, 2.
    NOTE.—Jesse was the name of David's father. 1 Sam. 17:12.
Christ, then, should be of the house of David. Luke 1 :32. Note the
sevenfold spirit mentioned in Isaiah 11:2.
    13. In what words does the prophet describe the Lord's dealings
with man? How is the coming kingdom described? Verses 3-9.
   14. What will the remnant do in "that day"? Isa. 10:20, 21.
    NOTE.—"In that day" "the remnant of Israel, and such as are es-
caped of the house of Jacob, . . . shall stay upon the Lord, the Holy
One of Israel, in truth." From "every nation, and kindred, and tongue,
and people" there will be some who will gladly respond to the message,
"Fear God, and give ghiry to Him; for the hour of His judgment is
                                 [ 12
i•ouie." They will turn from every idol that binds them to earth, and
will "worship Him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the
fountains of waters." They will free themselves from every entangle-
ment, and will stand before the world as monuments of God's mercy.
Obedient to the divine requirements, they will be recognized by angels
and by men as those that have kept "the commandments of God, and
the faith of Jesus."
   15. Though many shall profess to belong to Israel, how many from
among them will be saved? Verses 22, 23; Rom. 9:27, 28.
   16. What shall the root of Jesse be in "that day"? What is said of
His rest? Isa. 11:10.
   17. Whom will the Lord set His hand to recover? From where will
they be gathered? Verses 11, 12.
    NoTE.—This will be the "second time" God recovers His people,
and this prophecy has its fulfillment at the second coming of Christ.
The first gathering was into the Promised Land in the time of Moses
and Joshua.
    18. What will become of envy and jealousy? Against whom will
Israel use their united strength? Verses 13-16.
    NOTE.—This has its application.to God's' people in all ages. Only
as all envy and jealousy are banished from our hearts, can we ever
successfully do the work given us. We must be .a united people, or we
shall fail.


                            LESSON 5
A SONG OF PRAISE; THE EARTH DESTROYED;
           THE FALL OF SATAN
               August 4, 1928
LESSON SCRIPTURES: Isaiah 12; 13; 24; 14.
MEMORY VERSE: Isa. 12: 2, 3.
LESSON HELP: "The Great Controversy," pp. 653-661 (new ed., pp. 735-743).
                           INTRODUCTION ,
    The twelfth chapter of Isaiah is a song of praise which God's peo-
ple will sing• "in that day." The twenty-fourth chapter deals with the
destruction of the earth and the gathering of God'S people from its
four corners. Chapter fourteen deals with Satan, and the causes of his
fall and final destruction. These three chapters are "present truth"
for this time. Although we may not be able to understand every detail
of each verse, the main lessons are clear.
                             THE LESSON
    1. "In that day," what will God's people say? Isa. 12:1-3.
    NOTE.—"That day" evidently has reference to the time just pre-
ceding the coming of the Lord, as brought to view in the latter part
of the eleventh chapter of Isaiah.
                                  [13 ]
    The twelfth chapter is a song of the experience, of the people of
God. For a little while God has been angry with them, but now they
are. comforted.
    2. In what words will God's people further express their joy?
Verses 4-6.
    NOTE.—"Declare His doings." Tell the people that God is the
Creator. Tell what He has done for your soul. Exalt His name. God
has not left His people. He is still "the Holy One" in the midst of
His own.
    3. In the day of the Lord, who will be gathered , to battle? How
does that day come upon men? What will the effect be upon mankind?
Isa. 13:4, 6, 7.
    4. How is the day of the Lord spoken of? Verse 9.
    NOTE.—The day of the Lord will come as a day of deliverance to
the saints, but to the wicked it will be a day of wrath and fierce an-
ger. (See Zeph. 1:14-18.)                                       ••
    5. What is said of the stars, the sun, and the moon? Verse 10.
(See Matt. 24:29.)
    NOTE.—The signs in the sun, moon, and stars are here mentioned.
The sun was darkened in accord with the words of this prophecy, May
19, 1780; the moon, the following night; and the great sign of the fall-
ing stars took place November 13, 1833. One additional item of note
is here mentioned: "The sun shall be darkened in his going forth,"
that is, before noon. This was literally fulfilled, the darkening of the
sun beginning about 10 A. M.
    6. What terrible destruction will God bring upon the world? What
punishment will come to the wicked? Isa. 13:11, 13; 24:1, 3, 4.
    NOTE.—Of the condition of the earth at that time the following is
written: "The whole earth appears like a desolate wilderness. The
ruins of cities and villages destroyed by the earthquake, uprooted trees,
ragged rocks thrown out by the sea or torn out of the earth itself, are
scattered over its surface, while vast caverns mark the spot where the
mountains have been rent from their foundations."—"The Great Con-
troversy," p. 657.
     7. Why will this destruction come? Isa. 24:5, 6.
    NoTE.—God's charge against the people is that they have "trans-
gressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting cove-
nant." This is true in our day. The laws of both God and man are
lightly regarded, crime and transgression are rapidly increasing, and
the everlasting covenant is broken.
    8. What is the result of this destruction? Verses 7-12.
    NoTE.—God will speak in ways that can not be misunderstood.
When the earth shall be given over to desolation, the merry-hearted
will sigh, the harp shall cease as well as the song, all joy is darkened
and mirth is gone. Men now seem to be pleasure mad, but when the
cities are broken down and destruction reigns, there will be sorrow and
anguish. How significant is the expression, "city of confusion,"—
Babylon !
                                  [ 14
    9. What will be the experience of the remnant at this time?
Verses 13, 14.
    NoTE.—This is the shaking time. As when an olive tree is shaken,
or as when grapes are gathered, there are a few left still, so a remnant
shall remain firm. Psalm 91.
    10. Whence will come this song of praise? Verses 15, 16.
    11. How does the Lord state the hopeless condition of the wicked?
Verses 17, 18.
    NoTE.—Fear, panic, shall seize the inhabitants. As they flee, some
will be caught in the snare, some in the pit. And should they escape
from the one, they will fall into the other. "For the windows from on
high are open." This is a similar expression to the clause, "the win-
dows of heaven" in Malachi 3:10. There God pours out-a blessing,
here He pours out the vials of His wrath.
    12. How complete will be -the destruction of the earth? Verses
19, 20.
    13. Who will be punished? Where will they be gathered? For how
long a time are they shut up? What is said of the sun and moon?
Verses 21-23.
    NoTE.-7"The high ones that are on high," as contrasted with the
kings of earth, are the fallen angels, including Satan. The pit and
prison in which they will be shut up is the devastated earth. Rev.
20: 1. "Many days" has reference to the one thousand years. "At the
close of the thousand years the second resurrection will take place.
Then the wicked will be raised from the dead, and appear before God
for the execution of 'the judgment written.' . . . And Isaiah declares,
concerning the wicked, 'They shall be gathered together, as prisoners
are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and after
many days shall they be visited.' "—"The Great Controversy," p. 661.
 When the new kingdom is established, the glory will be so great that
sun and moon will be pale in comparison, or, as the text expresses it,
"be confounded" and "ashained." (See Rev. 22:5.)
    14. By what name was Satan known before his fall? Isa. 14:12.
   15. What caused the fall of Lucifer? What was the thought of his
heart? Verses 13, 14.
   NoTE.—"Lucifer had said, will be like the Most High;' and the
desire for self-exaltation had brought strife into the heavenly courts,
and had banished a multitude of the hosts of God. Had Lucifer really
desired to be like the Most High, he would never have deserted his
appointed place in heaven; for the spirit of the Most High is mani-
fested in unselfish ministry. Lucifer desired God's power, but not His
character. He sought for himself the highest place, and every being
who is actuated by his spirit will do the same. Thus alienation, dis-
cord, and strife will be inevitable. Dominion becomes the prize of the
strongest. The kingdom of Satan is a kingdom of force; every in-
dividual regards every other as an obstacle in the way of his own ad-
vancement, or a stepping-stone on which he himself may climb to a
higher place."—"The Desire of Ages," pp. 435, 436.
                                    IS
   16. How is Satan described by Ezekiel? Eze. 28:12, 13.
   NoTE.—The king of Tyrus mentioned in verse 12 is evidently here
used as a symbol of Lucifer, or Satan. The! statement in verse 13,
"Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God," coupled with the state-
ments in verses 14-17, makes it plain that no other could have been in-
tended.
   17. What high position did Lucifer hold? What is said of his
"ways"? Verses 14, 15.
   NoTE.—Moffatt translates it thus: "From the day you were cre-
ated, you lived a perfect life, till you were discovered doing wrong."
   18. What did God say He would do to this covering cherub? Why
was he "lifted up"? Verses 16, 17.


                LESSON 6
THE TRIALS AND TRIUMPHS OF GOD'S PEOPLE
              August 11, 1928
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Isaiah 25; 26.
MEMORY VERSE: Isa. 26: 3.
LESSON HELPS: "The Acts of the Apostles," pp. 593-602; "The Great Con-
  troversy," pp. 635-642 (new ed., pp. 717-724).
                           INTRODUCTION
    The twenty-fifth chapter of Isaiah is a hymn of praise to Jehovah
by the remnant church, which has just escaped the events mentioned
in chapter 24. The twenty-sixth chapter is a song of the experience
of God's people in connection with the events just preceding the com-
ing of the Lord. This makes these chapters "present truth" in a very
real sense. As this lesson is studied, these experiences will become
more real to us, especially as we know that the events portrayed are
just before us.
                             THE LESSON
    1. What reason does Isaiah give for praising God? Isa. 25:1, 2.
    2. What has God been to the poor and needy? When will protec-
tion especially be needed against the storm and the heat? Verse 4.
(See Rev. 16; Ps. 91.)
    NOTE.—"The darkest hour of the church's struggle with the powers
of evil, is that which immediately precedes the day of her final deliv-
erance. But none who trust in God need fear; for 'when the blast of
the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall,' God will be to His
church refuge from the storm.' "—"Prophets and Kings," p. 725.
    3. When will the events spoken of in verse 8 take place? 1 Cor.
15:54; Rev. 21:4.
    NOTE.—"From garrets, front hovels, from dungeons, from scaffolds,
from mountains and deserts, from the caves of the earth and the cav-
erns of the sea, Christ will gather His children to Himself. On earth
                                 [ 16
they have been destitute, afflicted, and tormented. Millions have gone
down to the grave loaded with infamy because they refused to yield
to the deceptive claims of Satan. By human tribunals the children of
God hlve been adjudged the vilest of criminals. But the day is near
when 'God is judge Himself.' Phen the decisions of earth shall be
reversed. 'The rebuke of His people shall He take away.' White robes
will be given to every one of them. And 'they shall, call them the holy
people, the redeemed of the Lord.'"—"Christ's Object Lessons," pp.
179, 180.
   4. What will the redeemed 'say in that day? Isa. 25: 9.
   NoTE.--"Those who would have destroyed Christ and His faithful
people, now witness the glory which rests upon them. In the midst of
their terror they hear the voices of the saints in joyful strains ex-
claiming, 'Lo, this is our God; we have waited for Him, and He will
save us.' "—"The Great Controversy," p. 644.
   5. What song will be sung? Isa. 26: 1.
   6. To whom will the gates be opened? Verse 2. (See Rev. 22:14.)
   NOTE.—The gates of the New Jerusalem will be opened wide for
the righteous people that keep the truth. There will not enter into it
anything that defiles.
    7. Through all the struggles and turmoil of the last days, what
may he have whose mind is stayed on God? Why? Verse 3.
    NoTE.—"Those who take Christ at His word, and surrender their
souls to His keeping, their lives to His ordering, will find peace and
quietude. Nothing of the world can make them sad when Jesus makes
them glad by His presence. In perfect acquiescence there is perfect
rest. . . . Our lives may seem a tangle; but as we commit ourselves
to the wise Master Worker, He will bring out the pattern of life and
character that will be to His own glory. And that character which ex-
presses the glory—character—of Christ, will be received into the Para-
dise of God. A renovated race shall walk with Him in white, for they
are worthy."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 331.
   8. What admonition does the Lord give? What reasons are given
why we should trust in the Lord? Verses 4-6.
   NoTE.—At this time when cities shall go down to destruction
(verse 5), God counsels His people to put their- trust in Him.
    9. How is the way of the just defined? What name is here given
to the One who will weigh men's actions? Verse 7.
    NoTE.—The way of the just may be narrow, it may be steep, even'
stony, but it will not be crooked. It will be a "straight" path. Verse
7, Lesser's translation.
    10. Where have the just waited for the Lord? What was their de-
sire? Verses 8, 9, first part.
    NOTE.—The people here spoken of have been waiting for the Lord.
When His judgments were in the earth, they waited. Their desire was
to the name of God and to His remembrance, or memorial. The Ameri-
can Revised Version of verse 8 reads: "Yea, in the way of Thy judg-
                                [ 17 ]
meats, 0 Jehovah, have we waited for Thee; to Thy name, even to Thy
memorial name is the desire of our soul." God's name and His me-
morial have a familiar sound. The name of God is His character. And
the remnant people will have the name of God in their foreheads.
Rev. 14: 1. The Sabbath is the outstanding memorial of creation. "It
is to be remembered and observed as the memorial of the Creator's
work. Pointing to God as the Maker of the heavens and the earth, it
distinguishes the true God from all false gods. All who keep the sev-
enth day, signify by this act that they are worshipers of Jehovah.
Thus the Sabbath is the sign of man's allegiance to God as long as
there are any upon the earth to serve Him. The fourth commandment
is the only one of all the ten in which are found both the name and the
title of the Lawgiver. It is the only one that shows by whose authority
the law is given. Thus it contains the seal of God, affixed to His law
as evidence of its authenticity and binding force."—"Patriarchs and
Prophets," p. 307.
    11. What is the effect of God's judgments upon mankind? Verses
9, last part, 10, 11.
    NOTE.—Thus it has ever been. When God's judgments are in the
land, men humble themselves. They promise to do right. Verse 9. Let
the judgments be taken away, let the danger pass, and many forget
all their good intentions. Verse 10.
    12. What does God ordain for His own? What has He done for
them? Verse 12; Eph. 2:10.
    NoTu.—The American Revised Version reads, "Thou hast also
wrought all our works for us." God works in us both to will and to
do. We can do "no good thing" of ourselves. But, says the apostle
Paul, "I have strength to do everything through Him who gives me
power."
    13. What confession do God's people here make? What has hap-
pened to all the wicked? Isa. 26:13, 14.
    14. How has God blessed His people? What did God's chastise-
ment lead them to do? Verses 15, 16.
    15. What joyful news is proclaimed concerning those who have
died in the Lord? Verse 19.
    16. What invitation is. given to God's people during the time of
the "indignation"? Veise 20.
    NoTE.—"If the blood of Christ's faithful witnesses were shed at
this time, it would not, like the blood of the martyrs, be as seed sown
to yield a harvest for God. Their fidelity would not be a testimony
to convince others of the truth; for the obdurate heart has beaten
back the waves of mercy until they return no more. If the righteous
were now left to fall a prey to their enemies, it would be a triumph
for the prince of darkness. Says the psalmist, 'In the time of trouble
He shall hide me in His pavilion: in the secret of His tabernacle shall
He hide me.' Christ has spoken: 'Come, My people, enter thou into
thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself as it were
for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast. For, behold,
the Lord cometh out of His place to punish the inhabitants of the
                                   1183
earth for their iniquity.' Glorious will be the deliverance of those
who have patiently waited for His coming, and whose names are writ-
ten in the book of life."—"The Great Controversy," p. 634.
   17. To what time does this refer? While God's people are safely
hidden, what will come upon the wicked? Verse 21.


                            LESSON 7
         THE VINEYARD; •FALSE SECURITY
                         August 18, 1928
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Isaiah 27; 28.
MEMORY VERSE: Isa. 28: 16.
LESSON HELPS: "Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 726 (new ed., p. 761);
  "Prophets and Kings," pp. 587-592; "The Desire of Ages," pp. 597-600.
                          INTRODUCTION
    We are considering events happening in "that day," -that is, in
close connection with the day of the Lord. - Note how many times
"that day" occurs in Isaiah 27, 28. At the beginning of this lesson,
God assures His people that He will keep His vineyard, that He will
water it every moment, and that He thinks of it tenderly. He will stay
the "rough wind in the day of the east wind." Isa. 27:8. The same
tender care is evidenced in the parable of the plowman in chapter 28.
God's people will be tried and tested, but they will not be crushed.
Not so with the wicked. God will there do His "strange act." Verse
21. And there is no escape, no hiding; the bed is too short, the cover-
ing too narrow.
                            THE LESSON
    1. Whom does God say He will punish in "that day"? Isa. 27:1.
    NoTE.—The symbols, serpent and dragon, here used, refer to Sa-
tan. Rev. 20:2.
    2. To what does the Lord compare His people? In what impres-
sive way does He express His care for them? Verses 2, 3. (See also
Isa. 5:1-7; John 15:1-8.)
    3. What will be done to the briers and thorns? Isa. 27:4; Mal. 4:1.
    4. What gracious promise is given to the repentant sinner? Isa.
27:5.
    NOTE.—"Whoever under the reproof of God will humble the soul
with confession and repentance, as did David, may be sure that there
is hope for him. Whoever will in faith accept God's promises, will
find pardon. The Lord will never cast away one truly repentant soul.
He has given this promise: 'Let him take hold of My strength, that
he may make peace with Me; and he shall make peace with Me.' "—
"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 726.
    5. Who will take root? Who will blossom? With what result?
Verse 6.
                                  19
    NOTE.—How significant are the words "Jacob," "Israel"! They
come "of Jacob," but they become "Israel." Jacob means a supplanter,
a dishonest man. Israel meant a victor, an overcomer.
    "Fill the face of the world with fruit." Of the early church it
was said that they filled Jerusalem with their doctrine. Acts 5: 28.
Of the last church it is said that they will fill the whole earth with
fruit.
    6. What else will come to pass in that day?• How will they be
gathered? Verse 12.
    NOTE.—"The Lord shall beat off," that is, gather in the harvest.
The metaphor is taken either from the beating of olive trees to obtain
the berries (see Isa. 17:6), or from the beating out of the grain on
the threshing floor (Ruth 2:17; Isa. 28:27) "one by one." It is per-
sonal work that brings people to the Lord one by one. Even where
multitudes come into the truth, personal work must be done to es-
tablish them.
    7. When will the great trumpet be blown? Whence will the re-
deemed come? What had been their condition? Verse 13.
    NoTE,--God's people will have gone through great trials before
their final 'deliverance. It will seem to them that they must perish;
but when the trumpet of the Lord shall sound, those of God's people
who have been scattered in all the earth (Assyria and Egypt being
here used as symbols of the nations of the earth), will come and wor-
ship with the redeemed of all ages in the Holy City, in 'the "holy
mount," the dwelling place of God. Read "The Great Controversy,"
page 622, last paragraph.
    8. 'What will God be in that day to the residue of His people?
Isa. 28:5, 6.
    NOTE.—The Lord in that day shall be a crown of glory to the rem-
nant, a• diadem of beauty. When men glory in this or that achieve-
ment, the remnant glories in the Lord. Jer. 9:23, 24. God will give
His people good judgment as well as strength in the battle.
    9. What has strong drink caused both prophet and priest to do?
Verse 7.
    NOTE.—Strong drink has ever been a curse. Here the results of its
use is shown on religious leaders. They have wrong visions, they stum-
ble in judgment. While God's people are promised the gift of good
judgment, these stumble in judgment and are "out of the way through
strong drink."
    10. Whom will God teach knowledge and doctrine? How will it
be done? Verses 9, 10.
    NorE.—Commenting on these verses, the servant of the Lord says:
"Thus the word of the Lord is patiently to be brought before the chil-
dren, and kept before them, by parents who believe the word of God."
—"Testimonies to Ministers," p. 418.
    11. How did the word of the Lord come? For what purpose?.
Verse 13.
    NoTE.—"The most valuable teaching of the Bible is not to be
gained by occasional or disconnected study. Its great system of truth
                                  [20 ]
 is not so presented as to be discerned by the hasty or careless reader.
 Many of its treasures lie far beneath the surface, and can be obtained
 only by diligent research and continuous effort. The truths that go
 to make up the great whole must be searched out and gathered up,
 `here a little, and there a little.'
     "When thus searched out and brought together, they will be found
 to be perfectly fitted to one another. Each Gospel is a supplement to
 the others, every prophecy an explanation of another, every truth a
 development of some other truth."—"Education," pp. 123, 124. Why
 will they "fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken1"—
 "Because they did not heed the word of the Lord that came unto
 them."—"Testimonies to Ministers," p. 419.
     12. What will scornful men say? Verses 14, 15.
      NomE.—"In the class here described are included those who in their
 stubborn impenitence comfort themselves with the assurance that there
 is to be no punishment for the sinner; that all mankind, it matters
 not how corrupt, are to he exalted to heaven, to become as the angels
 of God. But still more emphatically are those making a covenant with
 death and an agreement with hell, who renounce the truths which
  Heaven has provided as a defense for the righteous in the day of
 trouble, and accept the refuge of lies offered by Satan in its stead,—
 the delusive pretensions of Spiritualism. . . .
      "They affect great pity for minds so narrow, weak, and supersti-
 tious as to acknowledge the claims of God and obey the requirements
  of His law. They manifest as much assurance as if, indeed, they had
  made a covenant with death and an agreement with hell,—as if they
  had erected an impassible, impenetrable barrier between themselves
  and the vengeance of God."—"The Great Controversy," pp. 560, 561.
      13. What has God laid in Zion for a foundation? Verse 16; 1 Peter
  2:6, 7.
      NomE.--"In infinite wisdom, God chose the foundation stone, and
  laid it Himself. . . . Christ is a 'tried stone.' Those who trust in Him,
  He never disappoints. He has borne every test. He has endured the
  pressure of Adam's guilt, and the guilt of his posterity, and has come
  off more than conqueror of the powers of evil. He has borne the bur-
  dens cast upon Him by every repenting sinner. In Christ the guilty
  heart has found relief. He is the sure foundation. All who make Him
  their dependence, rest in perfect security."—"The Desire of Ages,"
  pp. 598, 599.
      14. What will God measure by line and by plummet? Isa. 28:17.
      NoTE.—Builders use the line and plummet in their work, the line
- for horizontal work, the plummet for adjusting walls to the vertical,—
  hence these terms are used figuratively for the standard of truth and
  righteousness. When God builds, it will be true to the line and the
  plummet, it will measure up to the standard of judgment,—the law.
   Eccl. 12:13, 14. But men's buildings will be swept away. Matt. 7:
   24-27.
       15. What will become of the covenant with death? By what will
   they be trodden down? Isa. 28:18, 19.
       NomE.—Men have thought to avoid God's judgments. But no one
                                       [ 23 ]
can do this. The scourge, culminating in the seven last plagues will
come. These plagues will take some time, for "morning by morning"
and "by day and by night" they will harass.
    16. What apt illustration does God use to show man's inability to
save himself from the scourge? Verse 20.
    17. Why is the act of punishing mentioned in verse 21 called "a
strange act"?
    NoTE.—"To our merciful God the act of punishment is a strange
act. 'As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death
of the wicked.' . . . Yet He will 'by no means clear the guilty.' The
Lord is slow to anger, and great in power, and will not at all acquit
the wicked.' By terrible things in righteousness He will vindicate the
authority of His downtrodden law. The severity of the retribution
awaiting the transgressor may be judged by the Lord's reluctance to
execute justice."—"The Great Controversy," p. 627.
    18. What illustration from the field does God now use? With what
intent? Verses 23-29.
    NOTE.—The picture here used is one all can understand. After the
plowing and sowing comes the harvest, when the different grains are
threshed, each according to its nature. Fitch, black cummin (A. R. V.,
margin), is too tender to be threshed with the ordinary "threshing
sledge," a heavy instrument that would crush it entirely. Nor "is a
cart wheel turned about upon the cummin." This is another method
of threshing that would be destructive to the seed. Another transla-
tion of verse 28 is: "Is bread grain crushed? Nay, he will not ever
be threshing it, and driving his cart wheels and his horses over it: he
doth not crush it." A. R. V., margin.
    The lesson is plain. God will judge. God will punish. God will do
His "strange act." His own people will not entirely escape. He will
purify them in the fire, but the wicked will be destroyed. So take
courage. God watches over His own. (See 1 Cor. 10: 13.)


                            LESSON 8
EVENTS CONNECTED WITH THE COMING OF
             THE LORD
            August 25, 1928
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Isaiah 29; 30.
MEMORY VERSE: Isa. 30: 21.
LESSON HELPS: "Testimonies," Vol. 1, pp. 186-188; Vol. 8, pp. 41-44;
  "Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing," pp. 213-216.
                          INTRODUCTION
   The first part of the twenty-ninth chapter of Isaiah evidently re-
fers to the judgments that were to come on Jerusalem. The enemy
would lay siege against it and also raise forts. Verse 3. God had fore-
warned of these calamities, but the people did not heed. Their eyes
were closed. To them the vision was as the words of a sealed book.
                                 [ 22 I
Even the leaders were blind. Verses 11, 12. The lesson begins with
verse 13 speaking to the people who confess God with the mouth, but
their hearts are far away.
     The lesson deals mostly with the events of "that day." Even as
Christ in the twenty-fourth chapter of Matthew mingles the descrip-
tion of the fall of Jerusalem and of the end of the world, so also does
Isaiah. But there need be no confusion. The two' accounts can easily
be distinguished.
                                THE LESSON
     1: What does the Lord say of a certain class of people? How is
their fear of God regulated? Isa. 29:13. (See Matt. 15:7-9.)
     NoTE.—"It would be more pleasing to the Lord if lukewarm pro-
fessors of religion had never named His name. They are a continual
weight to those who would be faithful followers of Jesus. They are
a stumbling-block to unbelievers, and evil angels exult over them, and
taunt the angels of God with their crooked course. Such are a curse
to the cause at home or abroad. They draw nigh to God with their
lips, while their heart is far from Him."—"Testimonies," Vol. 1, p. 188.
     2. What will God do among this people? What will become of the
wisdom of their wise and prudent men? Isa. 29:14.
  , 3. On whom does God pronounce His woe? What is said of their
works? What do they say? Verse 15. (See John 3:19.)
     4. How do they turn things? How will their work be esteemed?
What two statements are mentioned as being made by the creature to
the Creator? Verse 16.
     NOTE,—This verse throws light on the two preceding verses. The
wise men spoken of in verse 14, while they are said to "seek deep,"
verse 15, nevertheless turn "things upside down." They come to,the
conclusion that God is not the Creator,—"He made me not."- They do
not believe there is an intelligent. Being back of the universe,—"He
had no understanding." They have accepted evolutibm'or some Othet
theory of "science falsely so called" (1 Tim. 6:20); instead of crea-
tion, and have thus rejected the Creator.
      5. What will happen to the deaf and the blind in' tliat day?
 Verse 18.
     NoTE.—It is well for God's people to hold true to the words of
"the Book." It is thereby that the wise men shall be confounded. This
 is the "marvelous work" and "wonder" which God will perform. Verse
14. A small people who believe in their Creator and in. "the Book"
 shall cause the wisdom of the wise men to perish...
      6. In whom will the meek increase their joy? What is said of the
 poor? Verse 19.
      7. What will happen to the scorner and to those that watch for
 iniquity? How is a man made an offender? Verses 20, 21.
      NoTE.—There are those that "watch for iniquity," that will catch
 at a phrase or word and enlarge upon it, and thus make a man an
 "offender for a word."
      8. What was the prophet commanded to do? For what time was
 this? Isa. 30:8, margin.
                                      23
    9. What should the prophet write? What will the people not hear?
Verse 9.
    NOTE.—God's charges against His people are for serious offenses,
—rebellion, lying (Jer. 28:15-17), and disregard of law (Prov. 28:9).
    10. What do the people say to the seers and the prophets? Verses
10, 11.
    NoTE.—"The spirit of .this generation is, 'Speak unto us smooth
things.' But the spirit of prophecy speaks only the truth. Iniquity
abounds, and the love of many who profess to follow Christ waxes
 cold. They are blind to the wickedness of their own hearts, and do
not feel their weak and helpless- condition. God in mercy lifts the
veil, and shows them that there is an eye behind the scenes that dis-
cerns their hidden guilt and the motives of their actions.
    "The sins of the popular churches are whitewashed over. . . . Many
proclaim the law of God abolished, and surely their lives are in keep-
ing with their faith. If there is no law, then there is no transgression,
and therefore 110 sin; for sin is the transgression of the law."—"Tes-
timonies," Vol. 4, p. 13.
    Moffatt translates verse 11 as follows: " 'Out of our way,' they cry,
 `clear out from us, and trouble us no more with talk of Israel's Maj-
esty.'" This was the attitude of the Jewish nation toward the proph-
ets, and it found its culmination in their• rejection of the Son of God.
     'By their actions they had long been saying, 'Cause the Holy
One of Israel to cease from before us.' NOW their desire was granted.
 The fear of God no longer disturbed them. Satan was at the head
of the nation, and the highest civil and religious authorities were under
his sway."—"The Great Controversy," p. 29.
     11. What do they despise? In what do they trust? To what is
their iniquity likened? Verses 12, 13.
     NOTE.—The wicked rest in false security behind this "high wall,"
while at the same time they are despising "this word." But "sud-
denly" the break will come "at an instant!' This harmonizes with
1 Thessalonians 5:3.
    12. How complete will be the destruction? Verses 14.
    NOTE.—The wall shall be broken in pieces. There shall not be left
a piece large enough to take up a piece of burning coal on, or to dip
water with.
    13. Why does the Lord wait? What are they called who wait for
Him? Verse 18; 2 Peter 3:9.
    14. What will the people no longer do? What will God do when
He hears? Isa. 30:19. (See also Rev. 21:4; Matt. 7:7, 8.)
    15. Through what experience will God's people pass? Verse 20.
    NOTE.—"Often the church militant is called upon to suffer trial
and affliction; for not without severe conflict is the church to triumph.
'The bread of adversity.' The water of affliction,' these are the com-
mon lot of all; but none who put their trust in the One mighty to de-
liver will be utterly overwhelmed."—"Prophets and Kings," p. 723.
    "Thine eyes shall see thy teachers." Isa. 54:13; John 3:2; 14:26.
This whole experience is in contrast with Amos 8:11, where the "mul-
                                   f 241
titudes will desire the shelter of God's mercy which they have so long
despised." Instead, they will find a famine for the hearing of the
words of the Lord, and although they seek they will not find.
    16. What word will God's people hear? When will they hear it?
Verse 21.
    17. What is said of the light of the moon and-of the sun at that
time? Verse 26.
    NoTE.--"Now the church is militant. Now we are confronted with
a world in midnight darkness, almost wholly given over to idolatry.
But the day is coming in which the battle will have been fought, the
victory won. The will of God is to be done on earth, as it is done in
heaven. Then the nations will own no other law than the law of heaven.
All will be a happy united family, clothed with the garments of praise
and thanksgiving,—the robe of Christ's righteousness. All nature, in
its surpassing loveliness, will offer to God a constant tribute of praise
and adoration. The world will be bathed in the light of heaven. The
years will move on in gladness. The light of the moon will be as the
light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be sevenfold greater
than it is now. Over the scene the morning stars will sing together, ,
and the sons of God will shout for joy, while God and Christ will
unite in proclaiming, 'There shall be no more sin, neither shall there
be any more death.' "—"Testimonies," Vol. 8, p. 42.        .
     18. How is the coming of the Lord here portrayed? Verses 27, 28.
     19. In contrast with this picture, how are God's people spoken of?
Verses 29, 30.
     NOTE.—"It is now, in the hour of utmost extremity, that the God
of Israel will interpose for the deliverance of His chosen. Saith the
 Lord: 'Ye shall• have a song, as in the night when a holy solemnity
 is kept.' . . .
     "With shouts of triumph, jeering, and imprecation, throngs of
 evil men are about to rush upon their prey, when, lo, a dense black-
 ness, deeper than the darkness of the night, falls upon the earth. Then
 a rainbow, shining with the glory from the throne of God, spans the
 heavens, and seems to encircle each praying company. . . .
     "By the people of God a voice, clear and melodious; is heard, say-
 ing, 'Look up,' and, lifting their eyes to the heavens, they behold the
 bow of promise. The black, angry clouds that covered the firmament
 are parted, and like Stephen they look up steadfastly into heaven, and
 see the glory of God, and the Son of man seated upon His throne."—
 "The Great Controversy," pp. 635, 636.
     20. What is ordained of old? For whom? How is it described as
 to size and inflammability? How is it kindled? Verse 33.
     NOTE.—Tophet means a place of burning, that is, hell. The king
 is Satan.

THE JUDGMENT AND THE TIME OF TROUBLE
                         September 1, 1928
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Isaiah 32; 33.
MEMORY VERSE: Isa. 33: 22.
LESSON HELPS: "The Desire of Ages," pp. 333-337; "Christ's Object Les-
  sons," pp. 85-87 (new ed., pp. 87-89); "Thoughts from the Mount of Bless-
  ing," pp. 162-165.
                            INTRODUCTION
    Isaiah is a prophet of the future. In chapter 32 .the Man Christ
Jesus is introduced as a king ruling in righteousness, and the princes
in judgment. A special message is sent to rich women (churches),
warning them of the calamities to come, and that troublous times may
be expected until the Spirit is poured out from on high.
    The thirty-third chapter is a most interesting chapter to the rem-
nant church. Hypocrites will be in the church, but they will be "sur-
prised." God. will yet have a pure people. And they "shall see the
King in His beauty," which is His holiness, His glory. For that saints
and seers have longed. Then it will be a glorious reality.
                             THE LESSON
     1. Who shall reign in righteousness? Who shall rule in judgment?
 Isa. 32:1.
     NOTE.—The king is even the King of righteousness, Christ Jesus.
 The saints shall reign with Him in judgment. Matt. 19:28; Rev. 5:
10; 1 Cor. 6: 2, 3.
     2. Under what different symbols is Christ mentioned? How will
 God estimate mankind in that day of judgment? Isa. 32:2-8.
     NOTE.—Christ is here spoken of as a hiding place, a covert, rivers
 of water in a dry place, the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.
Verse 2. Meditate on each of these descriptions. Christ is this, and
much more.
     The following verses apparently speak of the time of the judgment.
God has given Christ "authority to execute judgment also, because He
is the Son of man." John 5:27. God will "judge the world in right-
eousness by that Man whom He hath ordained." Acts 17:31. Hence
it is as man that Christ is mentioned in connection with the judgment.
Isa. 32:2. It is at that time that "the eyes of them that see shall not
be dim." Verse 3. "Now we see through a glass, darkly." 1 Cor. 13:
12. Then we shall see face to face.
     3. What will be the effect when the Spirit is poured out? Verses
15-17. '
     NOTE.—Verses 9-14 are addressed to the rich "women [churches]
that are at ease," that are "careless," telling them that trouble is corn-
ing, that the harvest shall fail, that, as a result of this, the houses of
joy in the city shall be forsaken as well as the palaces. They have
been living in ease, a care-free existence,—now the time of trouble is
at hand. These troublous times shall continue until the Spirit be
                                   [26 1
poured out from on high. Then the wilderness shall he a fruitful field.
Then shall come the time when the latter rain shall fall, far exceeding
the former. Then all bands shall be broken. "The work will be similar
to that of the day of Pentecost. As the 'former rain' was given, in the
outpouring of the Holy Spirit at the opening of the gospel, to cause
the upspringing of the precious seed, so the 'latter rain' will be given
at its close, for the ripening of the harvest          The great work of
the gospel is not to close with less manifestation of the power of God
than marked its opening. The prophecies which were fulfilled in the
outpouring of the former rain at the opening of the gospel, are again
to be fulfilled in the latter rain at its close. . . .
    "The message will be carried not so much by argument as by the
deep conviction of the Spirit of God. The arguments have been pre-
sented. The seed has been sown, and now it will spring up and bear
fruit. . . . Notwithstanding the agencies combined against the truth,
a large number take their stand upon the Lord's side."—"The Great
Controversy," pp. 611, 612.
     4. Where will God's people be in the time of hail when the city
shall be low? Verses 18, 19.
     NOTE.—During the plagues when the hail descends and the cities
fall (Rev. 16:19-21), there will be a tabernacle to shield God's peo-
ple. Isa. 4:6.
     5. In view of what is to come, who is called blessed? Verse 20.
     NoTE.—Knowing that the judgments of God are in the earth, that
soon we must give an account of our work, how well we ought to im-
 prove the opportunity of sowing the seed. "You are to sow the seeds
of truth in every place. Wherever you can gain access, hold forth the
 word of God. Sow beside all waters. You may not at once see the re-
 sult of your labors, but be not discouraged. Speak the words that
 Christ gives you. Work in His lines. Go forth everywhere as He did
 during His ministry on the earth."—"Testimonies," Vol. 7, p. 36.
     6. What prayer ascends to God from His people in the time of
 trouble? Isa. 33:2.
     7. How are conditions described when God begins to show His
 power? Verses 3-9.
     NOTE.—These verses show the confusion at the beginning of the
 time of trouble. The people flee, the nations are scattered. Verse 3.
 There shall be complete destruction as when the caterpillar and the
 locust destroy. Verse 4. The valiant men shall cry, all travel ceases,
 cities go down. Verses 7, 8. Destruction shall even extend to nature.
 Verse 9. In the midst of this destruction, God's people will be safe.
 "The fear of the Lord" is their treasure. Verse 6.
     8. What does God say He will do? What are the people likened
 to? Verses 10-13.
     9."How will the sinners and hypocrites in Zion fare? What ques-
 tions are asked? Verse 14.
     NOTE.—"There are hypocrites now who will tremble when they ob-
 tain a view of themselves. . . . The people of God are unready for the
 fearful, trying scenes before us, unready to stand pure from evil and
 lust amid the perils and corruptions of this degenerate age. They have
                                    [ 27 1
not on the armor of righteousness, and are unprepared to war against
the prevailing iniquity. Many are not obeying the commandments of
God; yet they profess so to do. If they would be faithful to obey all
the statutes of God, they would have a power which would carry con-
 viction to the hearts of the unbelieving."—"Testimonies," Vol. 2,
p. 446.
    God is Himself a devouring fire. Heb. 12: 29. Hence the question
really is, Who can dwell with God?
    10. What six traits of character are mentioned as possessed by
those who shall dwell with God? Verse 15.
    11. What will be the reward? Verse 16.
    NOTE.—"In the last great conflict of the controversy with Satan,
those who are loyal to God will see every earthly support cut off. Be-
cause they refuse to break His law in obedience to earthly powers,
they will be forbidden to buy or sell. It will finally be decreed that
they shall be put to death. But to the obedient is given the promise,
'He shall dwell on high: his place of defense shall be the munitions
of rocks: bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure.' By this
promise the children of God will live. When the earth shall be wasted
with famine, they shall be fed."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 122.
    12. What two things will His people be permitted to see? Verse 17.
    NOTE.—To see the Lord was the deep desire of Moses. Yet the
Lord could not grant it. "There shall no man see Me, and live." Ex.
33:20. But the time shall come when there shall be no veil before our
vision. We shall see the Lord. Rev. 22:4. This is the climax of all
experience throughout eternity. There is no higher. But only those
who have experienced the power of Isaiah 33:15 will ever see the King
in His beauty.
    "The land that is very far off," rather "the land of far distances."
Not Palestine, where on a mountain on a clear day one can see almost
from one end of the land to the other. This refers to' the new earth
in all its glory.
    13. What questions will be asked? What shall they not see?
Verses 18, 19.
    NOTE.—As the people of God see this "goodly land," for a moment
the thought will conic to thein, Is all this true? Am I really saved?
Or is it a dream? Ps. 126:1. Will there be no one to oppress or destroy
any more? "Musing on the terror that has vanished, you ask, Where
are the tyrant's officers who taxed us, charged us, took our tribute?"
Isa. 33:18, Moffatt's translation. (See Isa. 60:18; 54:14.)
    14. What are God's people to look on? What shall they see? What
shall not be taken down, or removed, or broken? Verse 20.
    NOTE.—The tabernacle in the wilderness was taken down and re-
moved as Israel moved from place to place. Here the promise is given
that it shall be so no more. How blessed it will be when God's people
at last shall have "a place of their own, and move no more"! 2 Sam.
7 :10.
    15. What shall the Lord be unto His people? Verse 21.
                                  1281
    NOTE.—Here the Lord is likened to a place of broad, rivers and
streams. "A river never raided by a galley, sailed by no ships of war,"
is Moffatt's translation.
    16. What three things is the Lord said to be? What will He do?
Verse 22.
    NOTE.—It may be well to stress the word "our" in this verse. The
Lord is our judge, our lawgiver, our King.
    17. What picture is here introduced? Verse 23.
    NOTE.—The picture of the Lord as a place of broad rivers suggests
the picture in this verse of a boat with sails slack, ropes loose, and the
mast dangling so it can not bold the sails. Such a boat could neither
pursue nor escape the enemy. It would become a prey and be spoiled.
Its utter helplessness is suggested by the fact that even "the lame take
the prey." The spiritual lesson is obvious. We must always keep "in
trim," always be prepared, not slack nor unready.
    18. What shall the inhabitants not say? What is their condition?
Verse 24.

                            LESSON 10
   THE DESTRUCTION OF THE EARTH; THE
              NEW EARTH
             September 8, 1928
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Isaiah 34; 35.
MEMORY VERSE: Isa. 35: 10.
LESSON HELP: "Great Controversy," pp. 672-678 (new ed., pp. 755-762).
                            INTRODUCTION
   Two pictures are presented to us in this lesson. The thirty-fourth
chapter of Isaiah should cause us to do all we can to help others who
are now in sin to escape the terrible destruction that is coming. The
study of chapter thirty-five should cause us to examine closely our own
hearts to see if .we are really and earnestly preparing for such a home.
"The unclean shall not pass over it" (Isa. 35:8) ; only ,"the redeemed
shall walk there" (verse 9). Are we ready?
                             THE LESSON
      1. Whom does the Lord call to hear what He has to say? What
  is coming upon. the nations and their armies? What fearful picture
 of the slain is presented? Isa. 34:1-3.
      2. What will be done to the host of heaven? What to the heavens?
  Verse 4.
      3. What will come to pass in the day of the Lord's vengeance at
  the close of the millennium? Verses 5-8.
      4. Into what are the streams aewell as the land turned? Verse 9.
•
      NorE.—"Fire comes down from God out of heaven. The earth is
  broken up. The weapons concealed in its depths are drawn forth. De-
                                   [29 ]
 vouring flames burst from every yawning chasm. The very rocks are
 on fire. The day has come that shall burn as an oven. The elements
 melt with fervent heat, the earth also, and the works that are therein —
 are burned up. The earth's surface seems one molten mass,—a vast,
 seething lake of fire. It is the time of the judgment and perdition of
 ungodly men,—'the day of the Lord's vengeance, and the year of
 recompenses for the controversy of Zion.' "—"The Great Controversy,"
 pp. 672, 673.
     5. What book are we counseled to seek out and read? How sure
 are these predictions? Who commanded, and who gathered them?
 Verse 16.
     6. What is said of the wilderness and solitary place? Isa. 35:1.
     NOTE.—This text has an application to the gospel work now being
 done as well as to conditions as they will be in the new earth. "God's
 people have a mighty work before them, a work that must continually
 rise to greater prominence. Our efforts in missionary lines must be-
 come far more extensive. . . .
     "The vineyard includes the whole world, and every part of it is
 to be worked. There are places which are now a moral wilderness, and
 these are to become as the garden of the Lord. The waste places of
 the earth are to be cultivated, that they may bud and blossom as the
 rose. New territories are to be worked by men inspired by the Holy
Spirit. . . . The light is to shine to all lands and all peoples. And it
is from those who have received the light that it is to shine forth.
 The day-star has risen upon us, and we are to flash its light upon the
pathway of those in darkness."—"Testimonies," Vol. 6, pp. 23, 24.
     "In the transformation of character, the casting out of evil pas-
sions, the development of the sweet graces of God's Holy Spirit, we
see the fulfillment of the promise, 'Instead of the thorn shall come up
the fir tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree.' We
behold life's desert 'rejoice, and blossom as the rose.' "—Id., p. 308.
     7. How shall the desert rejoice? What shall be given to it? What
shall they see? Verse 2.
    NOTE.—The desert "shall blossom abundantly." "Christ delights to
take apparently hopeless material, those whom Satan has debased and
through whom he has worked, and make them the subjects of His
grace. He rejoices to deliver them from suffering, and from the wrath
that is to fall upon the disobedient. He makes His children His agents
in the accomplishment of this work, and in its success, even in this
life, they find a precious reward."—Id., pp. 308, 309.
    By "the glory of Lebanon" and "the excellency of Carmel and
Sharon" are without doubt meant their fruitfulness. In the desert
are no trees or grainfields. But this shall be changed. Those barren
lives that have produced no fruit shall blossom abundantly. This seems
to be a distinct prophecy of the times when those lands'that have been
unresponsive to the gospel shall be wide open.
    "It was concerning the future fulfillment of this prophecy that
Isaiah had heard the shining seraphim singing before the throne, 'The
whole earth is full of His glory.' The prophet, confident of the cer:
tainty of these words, himself afterwards boldly declared of those who
                                     30 ]
were bowing down to images of wood and stone, 'They shall see the
glory of the Lord, and the excellency of our• God.'
    "To-day this prophecy is meeting rapid fulfillment. The mission-
ary activities of the church of God on earth are bearing rich fruitage,
and soon the gospel message will have been proclaimed to all nations.
`To the praise of the glory of His grace,' men and women from every
kindred, tongue, and people are being made 'accepted in the Beloved,'
`that in the ages to come He might show the exceeding riches of His
grace in His kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.' "—"Prophets
and Kings," pp. 313, 314.
    8. What does God say should be done for the weak and feeble?
Verse 3.
    NOTE.—"Angels from a pure and holy heaven come to this polluted
world to sympathize with the weakest, the most helpless and needy,
while Christ Himself descended from His throne to help just such as
these. You have no right to hold yourself aloof from these faltering
ones, nor to assert your marked superiority over them. Come more in
unison with Christ, pity the erring, lift up the hands that hang down,
strengthen the feeble knees, and bid the fearful hearts be strong.
Pity and help them, even as Christ has pitied you."—"Testimonies,"
Vol. 4, p. 131.
     9. What encouraging word should be spoken to the fearful of
heart? In view of what event is this counsel to be given? Verse 4.
    NOTE.—The fearful, the faint-hearted, are not to be despised but
rather encouraged. And this in view of the fact that Christ is soon
coming. This is to be the keynote of every message, Christ is coming.
He will come with vengeance, to punish. He will come with the recom-
pense, to reward. He will come to serve, so be courageous. The Master
is at the door.
     10. What wonderful changes will take place when Christ comes?
Verse 5.
     11. What transformation will be wrought in the lame and dumb?
Verse 6.
     12. What will be done to parched ground and thirsty land? Verse 7.
     NOTE.—This is another promise that the desert shall become fruit-
ful. Nothing is much more uninviting or hopeless than a desert. Yet
 God has hope for it, and promises that it shall blossom. So let us not
be discouraged, but rather work on in hope.
     13. What name will be given to the highway of the Lord? Who
 shall not pass over the highway? For whom is the way? How clearly
 will it be marked? Verse 8.
     NOTE.—The "way of holiness." What a highway that is! It begins
 down here and ends at the throne. "We believe without a doubt that
 Christ is soon coming. This is not a fable to us; it is a reality. We
 have no doubt, neither have we had a doubt for years, that the doc-
 trines we hold to-day are present truth, and that we are nearing the
 judgment. We are preparing to meet Him, who, escorted by a retinue
 of holy angels, is to appear in the clouds of heaven to give the faith-
 ful and the just the finishing touch of immortality. When He comes,
 He is not to cleanse us of our sins, to remove from us the defects in
                                   [ 31 3
 our characters, or to cure us of the infirmities of our tempers and diS-
 positions. If wrought for us at all, this work will be accomplished
before that time. When the Lord comes, those who are holy will'be
holy still. Those who have preserved their bodies and spirits in holi-
ness, in sanctification and honor, will then receive the finishing touch
of immortality. But those who are unjust, unsanctified, and fifthy, will
remain so forever. No work will then be done for them to remove their
defects, and give them holy characters. The Refiner does not then
sit to pursue His refining process, and remove their sins and their cor-
ruption. This is all to be done in these hours of probation. It is now
that this work is to be accomplished for us."—"Testimonies," Vol.
2, p. 355.
     The American Revised Version of verse 8 reads: "It shall be for
the redeemed," rather than, "It shall be for those."
     14. What will not be found on God's highway? Who only will
travel upon it? Verse 9.
    15. What will the ransomed do? What will be their crown? What
experience will come to them? Verse 10.
    NOTE.—The picture presented in verse 10 was familiar to all Jews.
At the annual feasts, the Israelites would come in groups from all parts
of the land. They would bedeck themselves as well as their animals
in festive adornment, and sing as they journeyed along.
    It is with joy that God's redeemed people shall return to the heav-
enly Zion. No sorrow, no sighing, but everlasting joy shall be theirs.
Lord, speed that day !


                            LESSON 11
    INVASION OF JUDAH BY ASSYRIA; GOD
           DELIVERS HIS PEOPLE
                       September 15, 1928
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Isaiah 36; 37.
MEMORY VERSE: Isa. 37: 20.
LESSON HELP: "Prophets and Kings," pp. 349-366.
                           INTRODUCTION
     For a long time Israel had been paying tribute to Assyria. Heze-
kiah continued this custom when he became king, while at the, same
time he did all he could to prepare himself for a possible war with
Assyria. A few years after the beginning of his reign, Samaria was
taken, and the ten tribes were carried into captivity, 721 B. C. As
Samaria was only fifty miles from Jerusalem, Hezekiah might well
expect that it would not be long before the Assyrians would be before
the gates. Yet a few years intervened, and. then came Sennacherib.
It is at this point our lesson opens.
                        THE LESSON
   1. Who came up to war against Judah in the days of King Heze-
kiah? What cities were taken? Isa. 36: 1.
                                 [ 32 ]
   2. Whom did the king of Assyria send to Jerusalem? What was
the substance of his proposals? Verses 2, 16-20.
   NOTE.—Rabshakeh counseled the Jews to surrender and give a
present to the king of Assyria, else he would besiege. Jerusalem. He
warned them not to be persuaded by Hezekiah, who had told them
that the Lord would deliver them. The king of Assyria had already
taken several cities, and, according to the belief of the time, the gods
of Assyria were therefore stronger than the gods of the cities that
had been conquered. And could Jerusalem escape? Rabshakeh was
sure that his gods were stronger than the God of Israel.
   3. What did Hezekiah, the king, do when Rabshakeh's message
came to him? Isa. 37:1.
   4. What message did Hezekiah send to Isaiah? What request did
he make of the prophet? What did both do? Verses 2-4; 2 Chron.
32:20.
    5. What encouraging answer did Isaiah send to the king? What
did he say that God would send upon the king of Assyria? What
would he hear and do? What would happen to him in his own land?
Isa. 37:5-7.
   6. What further message did Rabshakeh send to Hezekiah? Verses
8-13.
    7. What did Hezekiah do when he received the letter? Verse 14.
    8. What was the substance of Hezekiah's prayer? Verses 15-20.
    NOTE.—Hezekiah addresses Jehovah as the One dwelling between
the cherubim, the Creator that made heaven and earth. He did not
deny the power of Assyria, but says that the gods of the cities over-
thrown were only gods of wood and stone. He asks God to show Him-
self mighty,—"that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that Thou
art the Lord, even Thou only."
    "Hezekiah's pleadings in behalf of Judah and of the honor of their
Supreme Ruler, were in harmony with the mind of God. Solomon, in
his benediction at the dedication of the temple, had prayed the Lord
to maintain 'the cause of His people Israel at all times, as the matter
shall require: that all the people of the earth may know that the Lord
is God, and that there is none else.' Especially was the Lord to show
favor when, in times of war or of oppression by an army, the chief
men of Israel should enter the house of prayer and plead for deliver-
ance."—"PropUets and Kings," p. 359.
   9. What assurance did Isaiah give to Hezekiah concerning his
prayer? Verse 21; 2 Kings 19:20.
   10. Against whom had the king of Assyria really exalted himself?
Isa. 37:23.
   11. Through whom had he reproached the Lord? What boastful
words did he speak? Verses 24, 25.
   12. How does the Lord answer this boast? Verses 26, 27.
   NOTE.—These verses contain important principles. God will use
one nation to punish another. That nation then becomes "the rod of"
His "anger" (Isa. 10:5), to "take the spoil, and to take the prey"
(verse 6), really an executor of the vengeance of God. Assyria had
                                133 ]
been so used, but had now lifted up itself and thought that all these
things had been done through its own mighty power. "Hest thou not
heard long ago," says God, "that thou shouldest be to lay waste de-
fensed cities?" God had been using Assyria according to plans formed
long ago. Now Assyria's time had come to be humbled.
    13. What would God do to Assyria? Verses 28, 29.
    14. Addressing Hezekiah, what sign did Isaiah say should be given?
Verse 30.
    NOTE.—In the third year conditions would again be normal so they
could sow and reap as usual. In the meantime they would be enabled
to live of that which "groweth of itself" or "springeth of the same."
This would border on the miraculous, and would constitute a sign.
    15. What is said of the remnant? Verses 31, 32.
    NOTE.—God's own, the remnant, should again take root, become
established, and bear fruit. This is not because of any inherent good-
ness. "The zeal of thei Lord of hosts shall do this."
    16. How would God defend Jerusalem? Verses 33, 34.
    17. For whose sake would God defend the city? Verse 35.
    NOTE.—God's honor was at stake. After the boasts made by the
king of Assyria, had not God defended His city, the nations would
draw the conclusion that after all Assyria was stronger than the God
of Israel. For "David's sake." God had made promises to David.
2 Sam. 7:16; Ps. 89:29-37. These must be kept.
    18. How did God's judgment come upon the Assyrian host?
Verse 36.
    19. What was the further history of the Assyrian king? How was
Isaiah's word in verse 7 fulfilled? Verses 37, 38.
    20. What lesson is there for the nations of to-day in the history
of Assyria?
    NOTE.—"The rise and fall of the Assyrian Empire is rich in les-
sons for the nations of earth to-day. Inspiration has likened the glory
of Assyria at the height of her prosperity to a noble tree in the gar-
den of God, towering above the surrounding trees."—"Prophets and
Kings," pp. 362, 363. This description is given in detail in Ezekiel
31:3-9.
    "But the rulers of Assyria, instead of using their unusual bless-
ings for the benefit of mankind, became the scourge o f many lands.
Merciless, with no thought of God or their fellow men, they pursued
the fixed policy of causing all nations to acknowledge the supremacy
of the gods of Nineveh, whom they exalted above the Most High. God
had sent Jonah to them with a message of warning, and for a season
they humbled themselves before the Lord of hosts, and sought for-
giveness. But soon they turned again to idol worship, and to the con-
quest of the world."—Id., p. 363.
    "With unerring accuracy the Infinite One still keeps account with
the nations. While His mercy is tendered, with calls to repentance, this
account remains open; but when the figures reach a certain amount
which God has fixed, the ministry of His wrath begins. The account
is closed. Divine patience ceases. Mercy no longer pleads in their
behalf."—Id., p. 364.
                                 [ 34 ]
    "The pride of Assyria and its fall are to serve as an object lesson
to the end of time. Of the nations of earth to-day who in arrogance
and pride array themselves against Him, God inquires: 'To whom art
thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden'l yet
shalt thou be brought down with the trees of Eden unto the nether
parts of the earth.' "—Id., p. 366.

     HEZEKIAH'S PRAYER ANSWERED; HIS
             PRIDE REBUKED
              September 22, 1928
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Isaiah 38; 39.
MEMORY VERSE: Isa. 38: 19.
LESSON HELP: "Prophets and Kings," pp. 340-348.
                          INTRODUCTION
    Hezekiah came to the throne at the time when the ten tribes were
about to be carried into captivity. He determined to do all he could
to save Judah from the fate about to overtake Israel. He cleansed
the temple, which had long been neglected and was in a state of ruin,
and reestablished the sanctuary service. "Once more the temple courts
resounded with words of praise and adoration. The songs of David
and of Asaph were sung with joy, as the worshipers realized that they
were being delivered from the bondage of sin and apostasy. 'Hezekiah
rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared the people: for
the thing was done suddenly.' "—"Prophets and Kings," p. 333.
    Hezekiah invited all Israel to the feast of the Passover. 2 Chron.
30:1, 6, 10. "But they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them."
This was the last invitation the ten tribes had. They refused it, and
were carried into captivity. But God still spared Jerusalem.
                             THE LESSON
   1. After the defeat of the Assyrian foes, what befell Hezekiah,
king of Judah? What message did Isaiah bring to him? Isa. 38:1.
   2. In what spirit did Hezekiah receive the message? What was the
substance of his pr4yer? Verses 2, 3.
   3. What message was Isaiah commissioned to bring? Verses 4-6.
   4. What did Isaiah request should be placed on the boil? Verse 21.
   NoTE.—"Those who seek healing by prayer should not neglect to
make use of the remedial agencies• within their reach. It is not a
denial of faith to use such remedies as God has provided to alleviate
pain and to aid nature in her work of restoration. . . . We have the
sanction of the word of God for the use of remedial agencies. Heze-
kiah, king of Israel, was sick, and a prophet of God brought him the
message that he should die. He cried unto the Lord, and the Lord
heard His servant, and sent him a message that fifteen years should
be added to his life. Now one word from God would have healed Heze-
kiah instantly; but special directions were given, 'Let them take a
                                 [ 35 ]
lump of figs, and lay it for a plaster upon the boil, and he shall re-
cover.'
    "On one occasion Christ anointed the eyes of a blind man with clay,
and bade him, 'Go, wash in the pool of Siloam. . . . He went his way
therefore, and washed, and came seeing.' The cure could be wrought
only by the power of the Great Healer, yet Christ made use of the
simple agencies of nature. While He did not give countenance to drug
medication, He sanctioned the use of simple and natural remedies."—
"Ministry of Healing," pp. 231-233.
    5. In agreeing to Hezekiah's request for a sign, what question did
Isaiah ask? How did Hezekiah answer? What change came in the
sundial. of Ahaz? 2 Kings 20:8-11; Isa. 38;7, 8.
    6. How does Hezekiah relate his experience? Verses 9-16.
    NOTE.—It is evident from Hezekiah's own record of his feelings
that he was not reconciled to God's message that he should die. "I am
deprived of the residue of my years," he said, as though he had a con-
tract with God for a certain number of years, and that God *as about
to cut him short. He would, of course, accept God's plan for him, but
it would be in bitterness of soul.
    7. What experience came to Hezekiah at the time of his. healing?
Verse 17; James 5:15.
    8. What observation is made by Hezekiah regarding the grave and
death? Isa. 38:18.
    9. What will the living do? What will the father teach his chil-
dren? Verses 19, 20.
    10. What embassage came to Hezekiah after his recovery? Isa. 39:1.
    NOTE.—"In the fertile valleys of the Tigris and the Euphrates
there dwelt an ancient race which, though at that time subject to As-
syria, was destined to rule the world. Among its people were wise men
who gave much attention to the study of astronomy; and when they
noticed that the shadow on the sundial had been turned back ten de-
grees, they marveled greatly. Their king, Meroda.ch-baladan, upon
learning that this miracle had been wrought as a sign to the king of
Judah that the God of heaven had granted him a new lease of life,
sent ambassadors to Hezekiah to congratulate him .on his recovery,
and to learn, if possible, more of the God who was able to perform so
great a wonder."—"Prophets and Kings," p. 344.
    11. What was God's purpose in allowing these messengers to be
sent? 2 Chron. 32:31.
    NOTE.—"The visit of the ambassadors to Hezekiah was a test of
his gratitude and devotion.. . . Had Hezekiah improved the oppor-
tunity given him to bear witness to the power, the goodness, the com-
passion, of the God of Israel, the report of the ambassadors would have
been as light piercing darkness. But he magnified himself above the
Lord of hosts. He 'rendered not again according .to the benefit done
unto him; for his heart was lifted up.' "—Id., p. 346.
    12. How did Hezekiah receive the ambassadors? What did he show
them? Isa. 39:2.
    NOTE.—"The visit of these messengers from the ruler of a far-
away land gave Hezekiah an opportunity to extol the living God. How
                                   [ 361
easy it would have been for him to tell them of God, the upholder of
all created things, through whose favor his own life had been spared
when all other hope had fled! What momentous transformations might
have taken place .had these seekers after truth from the plains of
Chaldea been led to acknowledge the supreme sovereignty of the living
God!
    "But pride and vanity took possession of Hezekiah's heart, and in
self-exaltation he laid open to covetous eyes the treasures with which
God had enriched His people. . . . Not to glorify God did he do this,
but to exalt himself in the eyes of the foreign princes. He did not
stop to consider that these men were representatives of a powerful
nation that had not the fear nor the love of God in their hearts, and
that it was imprudent to make them his confidants concerning the tem-
poral riches of the nation."—Id., pp. 344-346.
    13. What conversation between Isaiah and Hezekiah followed their
visit? Verses 3, 4.
    14. What message did Hezekiah receive from the Lord? Verses 5-7.
    NoTE.—"How disastrous the results which were to follow! To Isa-
iah it was revealed that the returning ambassadors were carrying with
them a report of the riches they had seen, and that the king of Babylon
and his counselors would plan to enrich their own country with the
treasures of Jerusalem. Hezekiah had grievously sinned; 'therefore
there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.' "—Id.,
p. 346.
    "The story of Hezekiah's failure to prove true to his trust at the
time of the visit of the ambassadors, is fraught with an important ,
lesson for all. Far more than we do, we need to speak of the precious
chapters in our experience, of the mercy and loving-kindness of God,
of the matchless depths of the Saviour's love. When mind and heart
are filled with the love of God, it will not be difficult to impart that
which enters into the spiritual life. Great thoughts, noble aspirations,
clear perceptions of truth, unselfish purposes, yearnings for, piety and
holiness, will find expression in words that reveal the character of the
 heart treasure.
     "Those with whom we associate day by day need our help, our
 guidance. They may be in such a condition of mind that a word spoken
 in season will be as a nail in a sure place. To-morrow some of these
souls many be where we can never reach them again. What is our in-
 fluence over these fellow travelers?"—Id., pp. 347, 348.
     15. How did Hezekiah receive the message? What relief was
 granted to him because he humbled himself? Verse 8; 2 Chron. 32:26.
     NoTE.—"Filled with remorse, 'Hezekiah humbled himself for the
 pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that
 the wrath of the Lord came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.'
 But the evil seed had been sown, and in time was to spring up and
 yield a harvest of desolation and woe. During his remaining years,
 the king of Judah was to have much prosperity because of his stead-
 fast purpose.o redeem the past and to bring honor to the name of the
 God whom he served; yet his faith was to be severely tried, and he was
 to learn that only by putting his trust fully in Jehovah could he hope
 to triumph over the powers of darkness that were plotting his ruin
 and the utter destruction of his people."—Id., p. 347.

             LESSON 13
WARNINGS AND REPROOFS; AN UNHEEDED
       CALL TO REPENTANCE
           September 29, 1928
MEMORY VERSE: Isa. 21: 11, 12.
LESSON HELPS: "The Great Controversy," pp. 4 ;k436, 451, 452, 631-633;
  "Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 684-687 (new ed., dp. 714-718).
                            INTRODUCTION
    In a brief survey of Isaiah such as is given in these Sabbath school
lessons, it is impossible to emphasize all the texts that really demand
notice. This lesson will take up scattered texts which either have not
been used before, or which might justly be repeated for emphasis.
While it is well that every scripture be considered in the setting in
which it is found in the Bible, some texts are of such a general nature
and application that no violence is done by considering them by them-
selves. Most of the texts in this lesson are of this character.
                             THE LESSON
    1. What beautiful promise gives hope to all? Isa. 1:18.
    2. What experience came to Isaiah when he was called to a proph-
et's work? Relate the circumstances. Isa. 6:1-10.
    3. What is the word of the Lord in regard to associations and con-
federacies? Isa. 8:9-12.
    NOTE.—Men may enter into confederacies and leagues, but they
will not accomplish that for which they are intended. They will be
broken in pieces. This phrase is thrice repeated in verse 9. (See 1
Thess. 5:3.) There is a lesson in this for the people of God.
    "No confederacy should be formed with unbelievers, neither should
you call together a certain chosen number who think as you do, and
who will say Amen to all that you propose, while others are excluded,
who you think will not be in harmony. I was shown that there was
great danger of doing this."—"Testimonies to Ministers," pp. 462, 463.
    "Those employed in any department of the work whereby the world
may be transformed, must not enter into alliance with those who know
not the truth. The world know not the Father or the Son, and they
have no spiritual discernment as to the character of our work, as to
what we shall do, or shall not do. We must obey the orders that come
from above. We are not to hear the counsel or follow the plans sug-
gested by unbelievers. Suggestions made by those who know not the
work that God is doing for this time, will be such as to weaken the
power of the instrumentalities of God. By accepting such suggestions,
the counsel of Christ is set at naught."—Id., p. 463.
    4. Whom are we to sanctify? What will He be to His people?
What will be the experience of many? Verses 13-15.
    5. What are we commanded concerning the testimony? What con-
cerning the law? For whom will we look? Verses 16, 17.
    NOTE.—"The Lord commands by the same prophet, 'Bind up the
testimony, seal the law among My disciples.' The seal of God's law
                                  (38 7
is found in the fourth commandment. This only, of all the ten, brings
to view both the name and the title of the Lawgiver. It declares Him
to be the Creator of the heavens and the earth, and thus shows His
claim to reverence and worship above all others. Aside from this pre-
cept, there is nothing in the Decalogue to show by whose authority the
law is given. When the Sabbath was changed by the papal power, the
seal was taken from the law. The disciples of Jesus are called upon
to restore it, by exalting the Sabbath of the fourth commandment to
its rightful position as the Creator's memorial and the sign of His
authority."—"The Great Controversy," pp. 451, 452.
    6. What should be our answer to them that invite us to explore
forbidden paths? Verse 19.
    NOTE.—"The belief in communion with the dead is still held, even
in professedly Christian lands. Under the name of Spiritualism, the
practice of communicating with beings claiming to be the spirits of
the departed, has become widespread. It is calculated to take hold of
the sympathies of those who have laid their loved ones in the grave.
Spiritual beings sometimes appear to persons in the form of their
deceased friends, and relate incidents connected with their lives, and
perform acts which they performed while living. In this way they lead
men to believe that their dead friends are angels, hovering over them,
and communicating with them. Those who thus assume to be the
spirits of the departed, are regarded with a certain idolatry, and with
many their word has greater weight than the word of God.
     "There are many, however, who regard Spiritualism as a mere
 imposture. The manifestations by which it supports its claims to a
 supernatural character are attributed to fraud on the part of the
 medium. But while it is true that the results of trickery have often
 been palmed off as genuine manifestations, there have also been
 marked evidences of supernatural power. And many who reject Spirit-
 ualism as the result of human skill or cunning, will, when confronted
 with manifestations which they can not account for upon this ground,
 be led to acknowledge its claims.
     "Modern Spiritualism, and the forms of ancient witchcraft and
 idol worship,—all having communion with the dead as their vital prin-
 ciple,—are founded upon that first lie by which Satan beguiled Eve in
 Eden."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 684, 685. (See Gen. 3:4, 5.)
     7. What standard are we to uphold? Verse 20.
     NoTE.—"While conflicting doctrines and theories abound, the law
 of God is the one unerring rule by which all opinions, doctrines, and
 theories are to be tested."—"The Great Controversy," p. 452.
     "But however much one may advance in spiritual life, he will never
 come to a point where he will not need diligently to search the Scrip-
 tures; for therein are found the evidences of our faith. All points
 of doctrine, even though they have been accepted as truth, should be
 brought to the law and to the testimony; if they can not stand this
 test, 'there is no light in them.' "—"Testimonies," Vol. 5, p. 575.
     8. To what is the remnant likened? Isa. 17:6; 24:13.
     NOTE.—These texts bring to view the shaking time. Not very many
 will remain after the shaking is done. But those that remain will be
                                  39
 a Gideon's band, and for them the Lord will work. Isa. 10:26; Judges
7:19-25.
    9. What statements are made with regard to Egypt? Where will
the altar of the Lord be placed? Whom will God send to the Egyp-
tians? To whom will the Lord be known? Isa. 19:18-22.
    NOTE.—While this prophecy may not be clear in all details, the
main outline is sufficiently clear to be understood. According to this
prophecy, the time shall come when some of the Egyptians shall learn
the language of Canaan, some even that are living in the city of de-
struction, or the city of the sun. God's worship shall be exalted, and
in their distress they shall call on the Lord, "and He shall send them
a Saviour, and a great one, and He shall deliver them." These Egyp-
tians shall know the Lord, and be known of Him. They shall not only
vow to the Lord, but shall keep their vow. The Lord has smitten, but
He will also heal.
    While all this found a literal fulfillment, and a real temple and
altar of the Lord was erected at Heliopolis, the city of the sun, by
Onias in the time of Ptolemy Philometer, of which the ruins have been
found, may we not believe this also to have a larger and a very definite
spiritual fulfillment? From the darkness and superstition of heathen-
ism, from the spiritual Egypts of this world, souls will be rescued,
setting up the altar of God in the very midst of the spiritual dark-
ness in all parts of the earth, in the strongholds of oppression and
evil. Egypt has always stood for spiritual darkness and superstition.
"Among all nations, kindreds, and tongues, He sees men and women
who are praying for light and knowledge. Their souls are unsatisfied:
long have they fed on ashes. The enemy of all righteousness has turned
them aside, and they grope as blind men. But they are honest in
heart, and desire to learn a better way. Although in the depths of
heathenism, with no knowledge of the written law of God nor of His
Son Jesus, they have revealed in manifold ways the working of a
divine power on mind and character. . . .
    "In various ways God will reveal Himself to them, and will place
them in touch with providences that will establish their confidence in
the One who has given Himself a ransom for all."—"Prophets and
Kings," pp. 376, 378.
    10. What cry is heard in the night? Isa. 21:11.
    11. What answer is given? Verse 12.
    NOTE.—"I saw that watch after watch was in the past. Because or
this, should there be a lack of vigilance'? Oh, no! There is the greater
necessity of unceasing watchfulness, for now the moments are fewer
than before the passing of the first watch."—"Testimonies," Vol. 2,p. 193.
    12. For what does the Lord call? Isa. 22: 12.
    13. What is the response of the people? Verse 13.
    NOTE.—God calls for repentance and weeping. Men turn from Him
and continue their feasting. "Let us eat and drink; for to-morrow we
shall die," never had more definite fulfillment than to-day.
    14. What results will follow this transgression? Verse 14.
    15. What precious promise has God given to His people in this
time of trouble and turmoil? Isa. 26:4.
