         THE. EPISTLE TO THE EPHESIANS
                        INTRODUCTORY NOTE

    This epistle was written by Paul from Rome probably in A. D. 61
or 62, during his first imprisonment, noted in Acts 28:16-31.
    Paul first visited Ephesus when returning from his second mission-
ary journey, which had taken him into Macedonia and Greece. The
people besought him to remain longer with them, but as he had made
a vow which required him to proceed immediately to Jerusalem, he
bade their farewell, saying, "I will return again unto you, if God will."
Acts 18: 21. Later he did return, and during the many months of labor
there, some of the most striking incidents of his missionary career took
place.
    Ephesus was a wicked and licentious seaport. People from every
country thronged its streets. The temple of Diana, the pride of the
city and surrounding country, was famous in all the lands bordering
the Mediterranean. Into such a heathen city, Paul and his colaborers
brought the gospel of Jesus Christ with such accompanying power that
the worship of the famous goddess was seriously. threatened. In Ephe-
sus the first recorded rebaptism took place, and this was followed by
the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. Here, too, God manifested His dis-
pleasure upon the seven sons of Sceva, the sorcerer, for the unauthor-
ized use of the name of Jesus. The books of the Ephesian sorcerers,
valued at fifty thousand pieces of silver, were publicly burned as the
converted sorcerers accepted Jesus as their Saviour. From the midst of
one of the great strongholds of heathenism, God drew out a faithful,
loyal church in Jesus Christ.
  Paul's parting words to the elders of the church at Ephesus as he
left them, expecting only bonds and imprisonment as the Holy Spirit
had revealed to him, is a classic of Christian resignation, heart long-
ing, and faithful warning to sons and daughters in Christ Jesus. Acts
20:18-35. How fitting indeed to follow such an appeal to the loyalty of
the Ephesian elders with an epistle, revealing the marvelous richness
and depth of God's purpose in all the ages concerning this church, or
called-out ones! •
    In the study of Ephesians, Dean Alford has this to say: "The
student . . . must not expect to go over his ground rapidly; must not
be disappointed if the week's end finds him still on the same paragraph,
or even on the same verse, weighing and judging,—penetrating grad-
ually, by the power of the mind of the Spirit, through one outer sur-
face after another,—gathering in his hand one and another ramifying
thread, till at last he grasps the main cord whence they all diverged,
and where they all unite, and stands rejoicing in hi@ prize,_ deeper
rooted in .thg         and_with—aafirgier _ hold •-on-thetruth--as--it is in
Christ."—"Introduction to Ephesians."

    heading, "Can You Tell?"
                                  THE LESSON
   1. Who wrote, the epistle to the Ephesians? Eph. 1:1.
   2. What is Paul called? Whose apostle was he? Verse 1.
   NOTE.—An apostle is one sent. The word "apostle is a Greek word
Anglicized. Twice in the New Testament the word is translated "mes-
senger" or "messengers." Phil. 2:25; 2 Cor. 8:23.
   3. By what authority was Paul made an apostle? Answer :—By the
will of God. Verse 1.
   NOTE.—The will of God was constantly recognized by Paul. Its
importance is featured in the six times that it is mentioned in this
epistle. , It is one of the key words of this chapter.
   4. To whom is the epistle addressed? Verse 1.
   NOTE.—"To the faithful in Christ Jesus" includes the believers
everywhere, in all generations.             ---
    5. What is the apostle's greeting? Verse 2.              _
    Noma.--Ephesians has been called "The Book of. God's Grace."
The word "grace" occurs in the epistle twelve times, and is magnified
                                    (.3
as in no other book of the Bible. "Grace" means "favor," and the
 grace of God is the favor of God. To all men it is unmerited favor.
We all need it, but no one of us deserves it. God does not owe it to us,
nor can we buy it. It expresses the love, the kindness, of God to utterly
unworthy humanity. Yet God grants it "freely." Rom. 3: 24.
    "And peace." Our carnal nature is at enmity with God, not subject
to His law, in bondage to sin. But Jesus Christ bore our sin, died in
our stead, and is therefore "our peace." Eph. 2: 14.
    6. Who is worthy 'of all blessing and praise? Verse 3, first part.
    NOTE.—It is an inviting, hopeful thought that we should think of
God as One who blesses and brings blessing to us. And the God who
blesses is worthy of all grateful adoration. Rev. 5: 13.
    7. What has God done for us? What kind of blessings are they?
Where are these blessings found? In whom? Verse 3.
    NOTE.—"All spiritual blessings." Not one left out. To our human
vision we may lack many temporal blessings possessed for a time by
our neighbors, but in God's plan, in the blessings that are eternal, not
one is lost. But the blessings are spiritual. They come to us by the
Spirit, in the Spirit; and "if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he
is none of His." Rom. 8:9.
    "In heavenly places." The evident meaning is, "In heavenly things"
 (margin). The key to this thought is found in the words of Jesus to
Nicodemus: "If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how
shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things I" The word is expres-
sive of condition and character, not merely of place. Spiritual bless-
ings come to those who are on the higher spiritual plane in Christ Jesus.
All our hopes and expectations for the future are in heaven, and our
faith and life in Christ lifts us to the heavenly plane, where Christ
dwells. Separation from the world is fundamental and vital, and in
that separation we are blessed with the life and gifts of the Spirit.
    8. What had God done for us before the foundation of the world
was laid? Verse 4, first part.
    9. What is the purpose in the choosing? Verse 4, last part.
    NOTE.—That which is of real worth in man or woman is not wealth
or beauty, fame or power, education or position, but character. That
alone is what God prizes; that alone will endure. 1 John 2:17; Jer.
9:23, 24. These characters have names expressive of the character
God purposes to develop in us. If faithful under His discipline to the
end, the new name becomes his to all eternity. Rev. 2:17. If unfaith-
ful, his name is blotted out, his case is closed. Rev. 3:5. The inspiring
thought to every one should be that we are called by. God's love to a
character worthy of eternal life.
    10. Unto what did He predestinate us? According to what are we
called? Verse 5.
    NOTE.—It is not the will of our God that any should perish. He
has predestinated no one to condemnation and death. "Shall not the
Judge of all the earth do right'?" Gen. 18:25; Isa. 45:22; Eze. 33:11.
                                  [4]
   11. To whose praise will our salvation redound? In whom are we
accepted? Verse 6.
    NOTE.—We are not accepted by "works done in righteousness,
which we did ourselves, but according to His mercy He saved us,
through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit,
which He poured out upon us richly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour."
Titus 3:5, 6, A. R. V. In God's plan we are sure of acceptance.
                       PERSONAL APPLICATION
   1. God has called and chosen you; have you chosen Him?
   2. What is the will of God concerning your salvation?
   3. If you are lost, who is to blame?

                          THE LESSON
    1. In whom and through what do we have redemption? Eph. 1:7,
first part.
    NOTE.—"In whom." In Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God,
is our redemption. He bought us by the sacrifice of His own life on
                              15 1
the cross of Calvary. 1 Peter 1:18, 19. "None but the Son of God
could accomplish our redemption; for only He who was in the bosom'
of the Father could declare Him. Only He who knew the height and
depth of the Rive of God could make it manifest. Nothing less than
the infinite sacrifice made by Christ in behalf of fallen man could ex-
press the Father's love to lost humanity."—"Steps to Christ," p. 16.
    2. What is included in this redemption? According to what meas-
ure is this forgiveness granted? Verse 7, last part.
    NOTE.—"The humble and broken heart, subdued by genuine repen-
tance, will appreciate something of the love of God and the cost of
Calvary; and as a son confesses to a loving father, so will the truly
penitent bring all his sins before God."—"Steps to Christ," p. 46.
1 John 1:9. It is the forgiveness of all our trespasses, the complete
cleansing of the sinner, and the justification of the pardoned sinner
that is taught. Isa. 1:18.
    God's love and mercy can not be measured. The sinner's plea is (1)
his utter need, which he feebly comprehends; and (2) the "loving-
kindness," and "the multitude" of God's "tender mercies." Ps. 51:1.
    3. To what extent has this grace been given to us? Verse 8.
    NOTE.—"Wherein He bath abounded." That is, in "the exceeding
riches of His grace." Eph. 2:7. He is the abounding God in all good
things. He revealed Himself to Moses as "abundant in goodness and
truth" (Ex. 34:6) ; His grace is "the abundant grace" (2 Cor. 4:15) ;
therefore His mercy is "shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our
Saviour" (Titus 3:6) ; He "will abundantly pardon" those who for-
sake their evil ways (Isa. 55:7). Does sin abound? Grace does "much
more abound" (Rom. 5: 20) ; and however desperate our condition, the
gracious God can do for us "exceeding abundantly above all that we
ask or think" (Eph. 3:20) ; and at the end of our fight of faith "an
entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting
kingdom of our Lord" (2 Peter 1: 11). But God does not give un-
wisely, but "in all wisdom and prudence."
    4. What has God made known unto us? Verse 9, first part.
    5. According to what has God made His will known unto us? Verse
9, last part.
    NOTE.—"Purposed in Himself." Our God does not do haphazard
work. He has a great and all-comprehending purpose, not alone for
this earth, but for His universe. Things now may sometimes seem
purposeless., Remember the words of Jesus, "An enemy hath done this."
The devil is using all his agencies to thwart God's purpose, but it holds.
All time is God's, all power and wisdom are His. The waiting will
demonstrate the wisdom and love of His purpose. Back of that pur-
pose, so far as this earth is concerned, is God's statement, "I am
Jehovah ; and there is none else." Isa. 45:18, A. R. V. And He, the all-
sufficient One, will fulfill His purpose according to His good pleasure.
    6. What is the fullness of God's purpose?• Verse 10.
    NOTE.—"In the dispensation of the fullnsss of times." In the years
that lie just ahead, when the "fullness of times" shall come, it is God's
                                     61
.purpose to gather "in one all things in Christ." The Redeemer will in
 that day in actuality as now in God's plan and purpose, be the One in
 whom are all things both in heaven and on earth. To the individual,
 however, the important thing is to know he is in God's purpose in
 Christ Jesus. The mystery is solved to the child of faith, "Christ in
 you, the hope of glory." You yielding all to Him, and He Redeemer,
 Saviour, Sanctifier, coming into your life, and making you "to the
 praise of the glory of His grace." Wonderful, miraculous mystery, but
 it is ours to know. All things of worth which this worldtknows can not
 be compared to its eternal value.
    7. What part have we in God's purpose? Verse 11, first part.
    NOTE.—"Have obtained an inheritance." It is ours in Christ Jesus.
When we receive Him, we receive the inheritance in Him. "By and by
the gates of heaven will be thrown open to admit God's children, and
from the lips of the King of glory the benediction will fall on their
ears like richest music, `Come, ye blessed of My Father, inherit the
kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.' . . .
    "Every sinful tendency, every imperfection, that afflicts them here,
has been removed by the blood of Christ, and the excellence and bright-
ness of His glory, far exceeding the brightness of the sun, is imparted
to them."—"Steps to Christ," pp. 131, 132.
    8. How were we brought into the purpose? Verse 11, second part.
    NoTE.—"It is impossible for us, of ourselves, to escape from the
pit of sin in which we are sunken. Our hearts are evil, and we can not
change them. .. . There must be a power working from within, a new
life from above, before men can be changed from sin to holiness. That
power is Christ. His grace alone can quicken the lifeless faculties of
the soul, and attract it to God, to holiness."—"Steps to Christ," p. 20.
    9. If we yield to the will of God, who is praised and glorified by
our character?. Verse 12.
    NOTE.—"Praise of His glory." "The revelation of His own glory
in the form of humanity, will bring heaven so near to men that the
beauty adorning the inner temple will be seen in every soul in whom
the Saviour dwells. Men will be captivated by the glory of an abiding
Christ. And in currents of praise and thanksgiving from the many
souls thus won to God, glory will flow back to the great Giver."—
"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 420.
    10. What is the basis of trusting in Christ? Verse 13, first part.
    NOTE.—"The word of truth." The importance of the word of truth
can not be overstressed. It is absolutely vital. Jesus said, "I am the
way, the truth, and the life." John 14:6. We are sanctified by His
word of truth. John 17:17. And He says, "The words that I speak
unto you, they are spirit, and they are life." John 6:63. Truth is
warm, living, mighty. And the basis of truth is the living word of
truth, the gospel.
    11. What assurance, or pledge, is given that our hope of the in-
 heritance will be fulfilled? Verse 13, last part.
                                  [71
    NOTE.— The seal signifies that the transaction is completed. "Those
who see Christ in His true character, and receive Him into the heart,
have everlasting life. It is through the Spirit that Christ dwells in us;
and the Spirit of God, received into the heart by faith, is the beginning
of the life eternal."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 388. The change, the
power, the sealing, are not the Spirit; these are wrought by the Spirit.
    12. What is this gift of the Spirit said to be? For how long does
it serve? Verse 14.
    NOTE.—"The earnest of our inheritance." An "earnest" is a part of
the price given to bind a bargain. For instance, a buyer purchases a
piece of land which he will take possession of in one month. That the
seller may know the transaction is dependable, the buyer pays down
one hundred dollars, the balance to be paid when possession is given.'
So God gives His Spirit to the believing sinner as a pledge that when
the Master comes for His own possession,—the earth and the re-
deemed,—the rest of the inheritance will begin to be enjoyed, and the
curse be removed forever. Earth and the redeemed shall shine through
all eternity to "the praise of His glory."
                        PERSONAL APPLICATION
    1. Are my sins forgiven?
    2. Am I by my own choice a part of the purpose of God, according
10.the good pleasure of His will?
    3. Have I received the "earnest"?

    1. What two things had the apostle heard concerning the people to
whom he was writing? Eph. 1: 15.
    NOTE.—"Nothing more quickly inspires faith than the exercise of
faith."—"Prophets and Kings," p. 351..
    "When men are bound together, not by force or self-interest, but
by love, they show the working of an influence that is above every hu-
man influence. Where this oneness exists, it is evidence that the image
of God is being restored in humanity, that a new principle of life has
been implanted."—"The Desire of Ages,"_p. 678.
    2. What did their faithfulness cause the apostle to do? Verse 16.
    NOTE.—No   doubt Paul prayed much for the prosperity of the gos-
pel everywhere, but because of his particular affection for the brethren
at Ephesus, he mentioned them by name in his prayers.
   3. What blessing did Paul desire the Father to give to the Ephesian
brethren?. Verse 17.
   NOTE.— Paul lays emphasis upon God, the Father. Eight times the
term "Father" is used, twice as the God of Jesus, and twice as the
Father of Jesus. Remembering our adoption as children, God is also
our Father, and Jesus is our elder Brother. What a blessed fellowship
and relationship it is!
   "In the knowledge of Him." "Of Him" refers to the Father. To
know God is to be truly wise. To know and understand God, His loving-
kindness, righteousness, and judgment is more than earthly wisdom,
more than earthly might or riches. Jer. 9:23, 24. The beginning of
wisdoin lies in the fear of Jehovah. Job 28:28. Measured by what it-
will bring, to know Him is life eternal. John 17:3.
    4. What is the next implied petition? Verse 18, first part.
    NOTE.—The American Revised Version reads: "Having the eyes
of your heart enlightened." Other authorities give a similar reading.
This expression occurs only here in the New Testament, and it is vitally
important. Naturally a man goes where his heart is set. Love is more
than reason; affection and emotion more often than knowledge and
judgment determine human course of action.
    5. What will the enlightened heart know? Verse 18, last part.
   6. Through whom does the Lord desire to reveal the greatness of
His power? Verse 19.
   NOTE.—"Exceeding." The word means "more than usual," "more
than sufficient," "measureless." Words are piled up and compounded to
                                       9
 express the great thought of God's power. "Greatness" is not enough,
 but "exceeding greatness" of His power waiting to be manifested in
 behalf of His children. We may be weak, literally "without strength,"
 having "no might," but with Him, in Him, the outlook is not discourag-
 ing; the superabundant power of our God is ours in response to faith.
    7. What example is given of the working of "His mighty power"?
 Verses 19, 20, first part.
    8. What does this same mighty power accomplish in the believer?
 Rom. 8:11.
     NomE.—"Satan can not hold the dead in his grasp when the Son
 of God bids them live. He can not hold in spiritual death one soul who
 in faith receives Christ's word of power. God is saying to all who are
 dead in sin, 'Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead.' That
 word is eternal life."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 320.
     9. What did that power do for Christ? Eph. 1:20, second part.
    NOTE.—Do not forget the picture: Jesus arrested, forsaken by His
 disciples, condemned by the" highest court of His own people, con-
 demned under Roman law; crucified, dead, buried, and the rock sepul-
 cher sealed by the empire of Rome, guarded by tried warriors. Earthly
 power, all earthly power, could do nothing. But God's mighty messen-
 ger from heaven appears in a glory which strikes down the strong
 Roman guard, an angel hand rolls back the stone from the sealed
 sepulcher, and be speaks the all-powerful message from the throne of
 the universe, "Thy Father calls Thee." All the powers of earth could
 not hold the robed figure resting in death. Likewise God's power is ex-
 ercised to usward to free us from the thralldom of sin and death.
    10. Where did that power set Jesus? Verse 20, last part.
    11. To what extent was Jesus exalted by the great power of God?
 Verse 21.
    12. In talking to His disciples, what did Jesus say had been given
 to Him? Matt. 28:18-20.
    13. Over how much is our Lord triumphant? Eph. 1:22, first part.
     NOTE.—This is God's purpose, although not as yet visible to mortal
 eyes. But it is assured by the resurrection of Jesus from the dead, and
 will in God's good time be fulfilled. 1 Cor. 15:23-28.
     14. What relation does Christ sustain to the true church? Verse 22,
 last part.
     NOTE.—"The church is built upon Christ as its foundation; it is to
  obey Christ as its head. . . . Upon no finite being can we depend for
• guidance. The Rock of faith is the living presence of Christ in the
  church. Upon this the weakest may depend, and those who think them-
  selves the strongest will prove to be the weakest, unless they make
  Christ their efficiency."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 414.
     15. How has God honored His church? Verse 23.
     NomE.—"The Lord has a people, a chosen people, His church, to be
 His own, His own fortress, which He holds in a sin-stricken, revolted
                                   110
world; and He intended that no authority should be known in it, no
laws be acknowledged by it, but His own. . . . His authority should
be kept distinct and plain before the world; and no laws are to be ac-
knowledged that come in collision with the laws of Jehovah."—"Testi-
monies to Ministers," p. 16.

                                THE LESSON
   1. What change did the apostle Paul say had been wrought in
those who believed on Jesus? Eph. 2:1.
   NOTE.—The American Revised Version reads: "And you did He
make alive, when ye were dead through your trespasses and sins."
                              [11 ]
Made "alive" is the opposite of "dead." The thought of life comes
over from chapter 1:20. Jesus lives, and you hath He made alive from
the death of sin. This is a change in life power and relationship.
   2. From what are those alienated who are "dead in trespasses and
sins"? Eph. 4:18.
    3. What had they been doing in the past? According to whose plan
had they been walking? In whom does this spirit now work? Eph. 2:2.
    NOTE.—They had been walking "according to the course of this
world." The meaning is made plain by the words "according to the
prince of the power of the air." In other words, to walk "according to
the course of this world" is to do the will of Satan instead of the will
of God.
    4. What does the apostle state the previous condition of the be-
lievers to have been? What are we by nature? Verse 3.
   5. What is God's attitude toward us? Verse 4.
   NOTE.—In chapter 1:19, 20, it was God's power that was domi-
nant; now, added to that power, is His mercy and love,—"rich in
mercy," "great" in love.
    6. What does God do for the spiritually dead? By, what are we
saved? Verse 5.
    NoTE.—"Transformation of character is the testimony to the world
of an indwelling Christ. The Spirit of God produces a new life in the
soul, bringing the thoughts and desires into obedience to the will of
Christ; and the inward man is renewed in the image of God. Weak
and erring men and women show to the world that the redeeming
power of grace can cause the faulty character to develop into sym-
metry and abundant fruitfulness."—"Prophets and Kings," p. 233:
    7. What marvelous thing has God done for us? Verse 6.
    NoTE.—"By the grace of Christ the apostles were made what they
were. It was sincere devotion and humble, earnest prayer that brought
them into close communion with Him. They sat together with Him
in heavenly places. They realized the greatness of their debt to Him.
By earnest, persevering prayer they obtained the endowment of the
Holy Spirit, and then they went forth, weighted with the burden of
saving souls, filled with zeal to extend the triumphs of the cross."—
"Testimonies," Vol. 7, p. 32. This experience should come into the life
of every Christian.
    8. What will God show in the ages to come? Verse 7.
    NOTE.—We are told by the servant of the Lord that "the 144,000
[Rev. 14:1] shall have the privilege of visiting all the worlds and
viewing the handiwork of God."—"Early Writings," p. 40. That the
redeemed ones who visit these other worlds will serve as an object
lesson of what the grace of God can do for sinners is indicated by the
following: "The redeemed only, of all created beings, have in their
own experience known the actual conflict with sin; they have wrought
                                C 12]
with Christ, and, as even the angels could not do, have entered into
the fellowship of His sufferings; will they have no testimony as to
the science of redemption,—nothing that will be of worth to 'unfalleu
beings?"—"Education" (Mrs. E. G. White), p. 308:
     9. What can never fully be revealed to the child of God? 1 Cor. 2:9.
     NOTE.—The exceeding riches of God's grace and His kindness to
the child of God can never be wholly revealed. This is not because God
is not willing, but because the human mind can never comprehend such
wonders. Therefore it will be an eternal joy, for every day of the
years and centuries and ages will reveal new wonders, new riches, new
beauties, in God's marvelous love and goodness in Christ Jesus. Re-
demption will be the science and song throughout all eternity.
     10. By what are we saved? Through what? Eph. 2:8, first part.
     NOTE.—"Grace floods with affection the sinner who has deserved
anger and resentment. If human salvation has its origin in the infinite
grace of God, if by that grace it is carried through to its eternal con-
summation, then our true position is one of immeasurable trust and
hope. We have only to receive the infinite blessings of the divine love;
we have to surrender ourselves to that stream of eternal benediction
which has its fountains in the eternal depths of the divine nature."—
"The Sermon Bible," Vol. 10, pp. 181, 182.
, 11. From whom is this saving grace? Verse 8, last part.
     NoTE.—Salvation is all of God,—His free gift. (See Rom. 3: 24.)
 The great thought in the book of Ephesians thus far is that the choos-
 ing, the marking out of characters, the redemption by blood, the for-
 giveness of sins, the exceeding riches of His grace, the Holy Spirit and
 the sealing, making us heirs in the eternal inheritance, participants in
 eternal glory, are all in the gift of Jesus, which we receive through
 faith. The saving and all that it means is the gift of God.
     12. If man could have saved himself, what would he have done?
 Verse 9.
     13. Whose workmanship are we? Unto what have we been created?
 Verse 10, first part.
     14. Who had from the beginning ordained the good works? Verse
10, last part.
     NOTE.—"Good works can never purchase salvation, but they are an
 evidence of the faith that acts by love and purifies the soul. And
 though the eternal reward is not bestowed because of our merit, yet it
 will be in proportion to the work that has been done through the grace
 of Christ."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 314.
                     PERSONAL APPLICATION
   1. Am I willing to accept God's diagnosis in full, of my spiritual
condition apart from Him?
   2. Have I made the gift of verse 8 mine?
   3. What would I undoubtedly do if I could be saved by my works?

                    ONE IN CHRIST JESUS
                            February 4, 1928
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Eph. 2: 11-22:
MEMORY VERSE: "Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners,
   but fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God." Eph. 2: 19.
                        Suggestions for Daily Family Study

    Applications." Discuss topics in the junior lesson under the heading "Can
    You Imagine?"
                               THE LESSON
   1. Writing to the Ephesian brethren, what did Paul enjoin,them to
remember? What were they called? Eph. 2:11.
   NOTE.—The Jews knew those of other nations as the uncircumci-
sion, and considered them as outside of the covenant and promises to
Abraham, and themselves as the circumcision, and within that cove-
nant. (See Genesis 17:1-14.) But Romans 4:9-11 clearly shows that
the blessing of righteousness came to Abraham while he was yet in
imcircumcision. The circumcision was but a token; that which brought
the blessing was faith in God's promise. The Gentile nations as, a
whole knew neither the covenant nor the token.
   2. What five things do men lack who have not Christ? Verse 12.
   NOTE.—(1) "Without Christ" ("separate from," A. R. V.), in
whom all fullness dwells; (2) "aliens from the commonwealth of
Israel" ("alienated from," A. R. V.) ; (3) and therefore "strangers
from the covenants of promise,"—of the promise literally, the great
promise to Abraham centering in Christ, the Seed; (4) "having no
hope,"—sinful man has neither hope in himself nor in his fellows (Ps.
                               (14]
146:3, 5) ; (5) "without God in the world." The text stands as a
mighty negation against the theory that God is inherent in every man.
Go over the fearful five points again and again, any one of which shuts
us out of the kingdom of God.
    3. How only are those who are "far off" from Christ "made nigh"?
Verse 13.
    NOTE.—"There is but one power that can break the hold of evil
from the hearts of men, and that is the power of God in Jesus Christ.
Only through the blood of the Crucified One is there cleansing from
sin. His grace alone can enable us to resist and subdue the tendencies
of our fallen nature."—"Testimonies," Vol. 8, p. 291.
   4. What, therefore, has Christ Jesus brought to us? Verse 14, first
part.
   NomE.—"Sin has destroyed our peace. While self is unsubdued, we
can find no rest. The masterful passions of the heart no human power
can control. We are as helpless here as were the disciples to quiet the
raging storm. But He who spoke peace to the billows of Galilee, has
spoken the word of peace for every soul."—"The Desire of Ages," pp.
336, 337.
    5. In accomplishing our peace, what resulted? Verse 14, last part.
    NOTE.—"No distinction on account of nationality, race, or caste is
recognized by God. He is the Maker of all mankind. All men are of
one family by creation, and all are one through redemption. Christ
came to demolish every wall of partition, to throw open every compart-
ment of the temple courts, that every soul may have free access to God.
His love is so broad, so deep, so full, that it penetrates everywhere. It
lifts out of Satan's influence those who have been deluded by his de-
ceptions, and places them within reach of the throne of God, the throne
encircled by the rainbow of promise. In Christ there is neither Jew
nor Greek, bond nor free."—"Prophets and Kings," pp. 369, 370.
   6. How has our Lord accomplished this? Verse 15, first part.
   NOTE.—Carnal, natural man can not abolish his enmity against
God. It is a part of his nature. It is intertwined in every fiber of his
being. But Jesus took upon Himself our nature of flesh and blood
(Heb. 2:14), "in all things . . . to be made like unto His brethren"
(Heb. 2:17), "of the seed of David according to the flesh" (Rona.
1:3) ; He met and "abolished in His flesh the enmity," "the carnal
mind" (Rom. 8:7), "the mind of the flesh" (Rom. 8:7, A. R. V.). He
conquered sin in the flesh for us forever.
    7. In what was the enmity symbolized? Verse 15, second part.
    NOTE.—"The law of commandments contained in ordinances." The
ceremonial and restrictive laws of the Jews, designed by God to keep
them a holy and a missionary people; were perverted by rabbinical mis-
interpretations, exalting the Jewish rulers in selfishness, and leading
them to despise all who were without their walls of tradition, until that
perverted system under Pharisaical pride was a fit symbol of "the
enmity" of the carnal mind. When type met antitype in the sacrifice
                                 I 151
of Christ, the system of types and shadows, having served its purpose,
came to an end, expired by limitation, and the whole barrier was
abolished, made of no effect, rendered void, empty, useless. The origi-
nal word is thus variously rendered in our common version.
      8. What was one object accomplished by the abolition of the en-
  mity? Verse 15, last part.
      NOTE.—All who believe in Jesus become one body in Him. That
  body is His church, of which He is-the Head. Eph. 1:22, 23. In Him
  Jew and Gentile, bond and free, become one, because in their regener-
  ate condition they are of One, Christ Jesus. The answer to the prayer
' of Jesus (John 17:21-23) is made possible through His death and in
  His creative life.
      9. What further was accomplished? Verse 16.
      NOTE.—"It was Satan's purpose to bring about an eternal separa-
  tion between God and man; but in Christ we become more closely
  united to God than if we had never fallen. In taking our nature, the
  Saviour has bound Himself to humanity by a tie that is never to be
  broken."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 25.
    10. As the result of our Lord's sacrifice, what message is sent to
this world? Verse 17.
    NoTE.—"He who spoke peace to the billows of Galilee, has spoken
the word of peace for every soul."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 337.
    "But real peace can never be secured by compromising principle.
And no man can be true to principle without exciting opposition."--
Id., p. 356.
    "In the heart of Christ, where reigned perfect harmony with God,
there was perfect peace. He was never elated by applause, nor de-
jected by censure or disappointment."—Id., p. 330.
    11. By what means do both Jew and Gentile have access to God?
Verse 18.
    NoTE.—Through Jesus we all have access by one Spirit to the
Father. The Spirit binds believers to God, and by the strongest bond
to each other. 1 Cor. 12:13.
    12. What blessed assurance is thus given? Verse 19.
   13. Upon what are these members of the household of God built?
Verse 20. (See 1 Cor. 3:11.)
    14. What effect has this wonderful corner stone on the building?
Verse 21.
    NOTE.—"Christ, the true foundation, is a living stone; His life is
imparted to all that are built upon Him. . . . The stones become one
with the foundation; for a common life dwells in all. That building
no tempest can overthrow; for— •
                  "'That which shares the life of God,
                      With Him surviveth all.' "
                —"Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing," p. 216.
                                [ 16 I
   15. For what purpose are we builded together? Verse 22.
   NOTE.--It is of vital interest to us whether or not we are in God's
building; whether or not we have with all our heart accepted His
measure of the character written in the book of life, and whether or
not we have given ourselves to Him to be fitted for the place, the
name, the crown, that belong to the character.
   "Because of sin, humanity ceased to be a temple for God. Darkened
and defiled by evil, the heart of man no longer revealed the glory of
the divine One. But by the incarnation of the Son of God, the purpose
of Heaven is fulfilled. God dwells in humanity, and through saving
grace the heart of man becomes again His teinple."—"The Desire of
Ages," p. 161.
                       PERSONAL APPLICATION
   1. Is my experience described in verse 12, or in verse 13?
   2. Has the "enmity" in me been taken away?
   3. Am I a living stone, however small, in God's living temple?
    4. Do I act as those should who are truly "fellow citizens with the
saints"?

    1. In whose behalf was Paul a prisoner? Eph. 3:1.
    NoTE.—Paul's earnest desire and work for the Gentiles led to the
enmity of the Jews, and hence to his imprisonment. But he did not
hold against the Jews those things which they caused him to suffer.
He would have given his life forever if he could thus have saved them.
Rom. 9: 3. When the Master called him, Paul was told of the things
he would suffer (Acts 9:16), and the suffering was a part of the serv-
ice. Now that he is a prisoner, he calls himself, "the prisoner of Jesus
Christ." If we will but look upon our trials as God's appointments,
we shall find blessings in them.
    2. What does Paul infer that the Ephesians had already heard?
Verse 2.
    NOTE.—The dispensation, the stewardship, of the grace of God
for the Gentiles; he presses it home, "to you-ward." The grace of God
was dispensed to Paul that he might dispense it to others. Paul was
not self-sent. He was not seeking an easy place. Christ called him,
bestowed upon him the grace of the gift of an apostleship to the
Gentiles, and told him what things he must suffer for the sake of the
Master.
   3. Whathad Christ made known to Paul? Ver'se 3.
   4. How was the mystery of the gospel made known to Paul? Gal.
1:11, 12.
    5. When the brethren should read the way in which this light was
given to Paul, what would they understand? Eph. 3:4.
    NOTE.—The mystery which was made known to Paul by revelation
from God, not by preaching through human instrumentality, was a
revelation of the fullness of Jesus Christ. Called by God's grace, "it
pleased God, . . . to reveal His Son in" Paul (Gal. 1:15, 16), that he
might preach Jesus among the heathen. It was the revelation of the
living Christ in Paul; Christ in him "the hope of glory." Col. 1:27.
This mystery of God, this dwelling in human hearts through the Spirit,
is the mystery of the gospel, the power of God unto salvation to the
believers. Rom. 1:16, 17; Gal. 2:20.
    6. By what agency has a fuller revelation of this mystery been
made to us? In comparison, what light have other generations had?
Verse 5.
    NOTE.—The power of the gospel to save was known and understood
even when the mystery was not as fully revealed as to Paul and his
fellow apostles. The list of the faithful as mentioned by Paul in He-
brews 11, is witness to their grasp of the power of the gospel to save
even in their day.
                                 (18]
    7. To whom was the apostle Paul especially commissioned to de-
clare this mystery? What phase of it is here emphasized? Verse 6.
    NOTE.—The idea is not that God was about to save the Gentiles;
for that had been predicted. Acts 15:14-17; Hosea 2:23; 1:10. The
great mystery was that God's power could take antagonistic Jews and
Gentiles and make them one in God the Father, one in. Christ, one with
each other. The Scriptures show that God does not have different
dealings or covenants with Jews and Gentiles. Access into the mystery
of His righteousness, love, and power in Christ Jesus are equally open
to all through faith in Him.
    8. What had God made Paul's relation to the gospel? How was the
light of God's grace given to him? Verse 7.
    NOTE.—Paul had no merely nominal ministry. In that ministry
was the gift of the grace of God; and this not in theory, but by the
effectual working of God's power which transformed a persecutor into
an apostle.
    9. How did the apostle regard himself? What was the purpose of
the gift of this grace? Verse 8.
    NOTE.—PauPs.thought of his unworthiness is ever with him. The
gift of preaching to the needy Gentiles the unsearchable riches of
Christ became from that time Paul's life business. He could not be
swerved from that mission, and God greatly honored him with abun-
dance of grace.
    10. What was Paul to make all men see? How old is the mystery
of the gospel? Verse 9.
    NOTE. "The work of the gospel minister is 'to make all men see
what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the
world hath been hid in God' . . .
    "The spirit of the true shepherd is one of self-forgetfulness. He
 loses sight of self in order that he may work the works of God. By
 the preaching of the Word and by personal ministry in the homes of
 the people, he learns their needs, their sorrows, their trials; and, co-
 operating with the great Burden Bearer, he shares their afflictions,
 comforts their distresses, relieves their soul hunger, and wins their
 hearts to God. In this work the minister is attended by the angels of
 heaven, and he himself is instructed and enlightened in the truth that
 maketh wise unto salvation."—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 527.
    11. What is the privilege of the church? Verse 10.
     NOTE.—"The Lord Jesus is making experiments on human hearts
 through the exhibition of His mercy and abundant grace. He is ef-
 fecting transformations so amazing that Satan, with all his triumphant
 boasting, with all his confederacy of evil united against God and the
 laws of His government, stands viewing them as at fortress impreg-
 nable to his sophistries and delusions. They are to him an incompre-
 hensible mystery. The angels of God, seraphim and cherubim, the
 powers commissioned to cooperate with human agencies, look on with
 astonishment and joy, that fallen men, once children of wrath, are
                                   1191
through the training of Christ developing characters after the divine
similitude, to be sons and daughters of God, to act an important part
in the occupations and pleasures of heaven."—"Testimonies to Minis-
ters," p. 18.
    12. According to what purpose is all this manifestation of God's
grace? In whom does the purpose center? Verse 11.
    NOTE.—Thank God, the purpose still holds, and God's invitation is
still extended to fallen humanity, to come into the purpose of God.
God is taking a detailed personal interest in you and me. If we stay
by the purpose, we can leave all confidently with Him, and He will
work out even our troubles and trials to His glory, and therefore for
our highest good.
   13. How should this revelation affect us as regards the Lord Jesus?
Verse 12.
    14. What was the apostle's desire for the disciples? How should
his afflictions be regarded by the church? Verse 13.
    NOTE.—It was as if the apostle said, "The sufferings, therefore, of
your apostle are honorable to you and to your cause; and far from
being any cause why you should faint, or draw back like cowards, in
the day of distress, they should be an additional argument to induce
you to persevere."—Dr: Adam Clarke.
                     PERSONAL APPLICATION
   1. What does Paul's courage, determination, and faithfulness mean
to me?
    2. Am I as faithful to my opportunities for service as Paul was
to his?
    3. Is the experience of Ephesians 3:12 mine?


   "Temptations often appear irresistible because, through neglect of
prayer and the study of the Bible, the tempted one can not readily
remember God's promises and meet Satan with the Scripture weapons.
But angels are round about those who are willing to be taught in divine
things; and in the time of great necessity, they will bring to their
remembrance the very truths which are needed."—"The Great Contro-
versy," p. 600.

                                  THE LESSON
    1. What was Paul led to do as he contemplated the eternal purpose
of God? Eph. 3:14.
    NOTE.—The first thought, "For this cause," carries us back to the
first verse of the chapter. Verses 2 to 13 are a parenthetical statement
that the Holy Spirit introduced.
    "Bow my knees." "Both in public and in private worship, it is our
privilege to bow on our knees before the Lord when we offer our pe-
titions to Him. Jesus, our example, 'kneeled down, and prayed.' Of
His disciples it is recorded that they, too, 'kneeled down, and prayed.' "
—"Gospel Workers," p. 178.
    Paul's prayer is addressed to the great, loving God of the universe,
the "Our Father which art in heaven," to whom Jesus taught us to
pray.
    2. 'What does the apostle say further of the Father? Verse 15.
    NOTE.—It is a beautiful thought that all the Lord's children, all
who acknowledge allegiance to the Creator, belong to one family,—the
                                    [ 21 1
family of God; all sprang from one source; all are dependent upon
God for life, and breath, and all things; and all respond to the same
divine will as the supreme law of life.
   3. What was Paul's first petition for the believers? According to
what was the request made? Verse 16. (See Col. 1:11.)
   NOTE.—Paul knew that God is a royal Giver; he knew that the
exceeding riches of His glory, the glory of His grace, never grow less;
he knew that what he asked was just what God wants to do.
   "All who consecrate soul, body, and spirit to God, will be constantly
receiving a new endowment of physical and mental power. The in
exhaustible supplies of heaven are at their command. Christ gives them
the breath of His own Spirit, the life of His own life. The Holy
Spirit puts forth its highest energies to work in heart and mind.. The
grace of God enlarges and Multiplies their faculties, and every per-
fection of the divine nature comes to their assistance in the work of
saving souls. Through cooperation with Christ they are complete in
Him, and in their human weakness they are enabled to do the deeds of
Omnipotence."—"The. Desire of Ages," p. 827.
   4. What was the second petition for them? Verse 17, first part.
   NoTE.—So Christ lived in Paul; but before Christ could' live in
Paul, Paul must be ,crucified with Christ. Gal. 2:20. Paul's prayer was
that the believers to whom he wrote might have the same experience.
    5. 'What does this experience accomplish? Verse 17, last part.
    NOTE.—Rooted and grounded in Christ, we are rooted and grounded
in love.
   6. What does true faith always do? Gal. 5:6.
   7. What did Jesus say was the test of love to Him? John 15:10.
   8. How would such love for Christ affect our feelings toward our
brethren? John 15:12-14.
   9. How do we know that we have passed from death into life?
1 John 3:14.
   10. What statement that we might make would be a falsehood?
1 John 4:20.
    11. What is the real proof to our own heart that we love God's
children? 1 John 5:2.
   1\ToTE.—"He whose heart is not filled with love for God and his
fellow men, is not a true disciple of Christ."—"The Acts of the
Apostles," p. 318.
   12. When we are "rooted and grounded in love," what further ex-
perience may be ours? Eph. 3:18, 19.
   NOTE.—These are great thoughts for meditation. Verses 16 to 19
read thus in the Syriac version, one of the oldest, the language spoken
by our Lord, translated by Murdock: "That He would grant you, ac-
cording to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with might by
                                  [22]
His Spirit; that in your inner man the Messiah may dwell by faith,
and in your hearts by love, while your root and your foundation wax-
eth strong; and that ye•may be able to explore, with all the saints,
what is the height and depth, and length and breadth, and may know
the greatness of the. Messiah's love; and [that] ye may be filled with
all the fullness of God."
    13. What is God able to do for believers in Him? Verse 20.
     NoTE.—All that He has promised to do He is able to perform, far
beyond our poor asking. We can only ask for what we see and think,
but we can not see what God has. for us. He does exceeding abundantly
above all we ask or think according to the power which raised Jesus
from the dead. Read "Testimonies," Vol. 5, p. 264.
   14. With what ascription of praise does the prayer close? Verse 21.
                       PERSONAL APPLICATION
   1. Does my heart respond to the closing words of praise?
   2. Am I willing to enter here with all my heart into the eternal
advanced school of God, knowing that it involves self-denial?
   3. Is Christ dwelling in my heart by faith? How may I know this?

    Applications." Follow out the two items in the junior lesson under the
    heading, "Things to Do."
                               THE LESSON
    1. What does Paul again designate himself? Eph. 4:1, first part.
 (See Eph. 3:1.)
     Nom—Paul did not count himself the prisoner of the Jews or Ro-
 mans. He was doing work for God under His commission. As his
 Master possessed all power to release him but did not, he was the
 Lord's prisoner, and he held no enmity against those who persecuted
him.
    2. What is Paul's plea to the believers? Verse 1, last part.
    NOTE.—Paul pleads with the brethren to walk worthy of the voca-
 tion,—the calling or the life work,—to which they were called. So
God's people are called out of sin and darkness, called out from
 idolatry, and from everything that is low, base, and evil, called out
 from the world's follies, ambitions, and blindness. They are called out
by the word of God to better things. We are "called to be saints"
 (Rom. 1:7) ; "called unto the fellowship of His Son Jesus Christ our
Lord" (1 Cor. 1:9) called from sin's bondage to liberty (Gal. 5:13).
What an appeal is that of this text to us, to walk worthy of the calling
to which God has called us.
    3. In what spirit are we to walk? Verse 2.
    NOTE.—"Lowliness." In the Christian sense it is the soul's hu-
mility before God (Isa. 57:15), and loving regard for one's brethren
(Phil. 2:3).
    "Meekness." Not mere mildness and gentleness. True meekness
couples the child of God with God's infinite strength and power. Two
of the strongest characters in the Bible were "meek,"—"Moses the
man of God," and Jesus, "the Son of God." The thought of teachable-
ness is in the use of the word. Ps. 25:9.
    "Long-suffering." Vincent, commenting on James 5:7, says this
word has "the sense of strong passion, stronger than anger," "a tumul-
tuous welling up of the whole spirit; a mighty emotion which seizes
and moves the whole inner man; hence the restraint implied is most
correctly expressed by long-suffering, . . . a patient holding out under
trial; a long protracted restraint of the soul from yielding to passion,
especially the passion of anger."
    "Forbearing." "To put up with, to bear with," to bear with one
another in love. We are called to all these.
    4. What should God's people do to preserve unity? Verse 3.
    NOTE.—"Endeavoring." The definition of the Greek word is "to
use speed, to make effort, be prompt or earnest." Heal the break in the
unity at once. Let not the break in the bond of peace widen. Keep
                                    241
strong the bond of peace between you and your Lord,, that Christ may
be the bond between you and your brethren.
    5. What is the first of these unities? Verse 4, first part.
    NOTE.—"One body." The body of Christ, His church. Eph. 1:22,
23. It,is ever in the singular, but the body has many members. Some
are yet scattered.
    6. What is the second unity and the life of the union? Verse 4,
second part.
    NOTE.—"One spirit." The Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God, the
Spirit of Christ, the Comforter, the very life of God that vivifies and
binds together His church. "The Spirit of God, received into the heart
by faith, is the beginning of the life eternal."—"The Desire of Ages,"
p. 388.
    7. What is the third of the unities? Verse 4, last part.
   NOTE.—"One hope." Hope is based on God's promises. And this
blessed hope•centers in our Lord Jesus Christ. It is the glorious hope
of our calling that cheers the Christian pilgrim along the way.r There
may be rocky steeps, dark valleys, sore trials, fearful sufferings, loath-
some prisons, but the rays of the glorious hope lift the load, lighten
the way, cheer the heart, and hold steadfast to the end.
   8. How many lords have we? Verse 5.
    NOTE.—In the great non-Christian world they have "lords many."
But the Christian has one Lord, one Master, not an earthly,—save only
for a little while when He came to show how much God loved us,—
but a heavenly, combining in Himself the divine and human, power and
sympathy, life and fellowship.
   9. How many faiths have we? Verse 5.
    NOTE.—"One faith." This faith yields all God asks and takes all
God gives.
    10. How many baptisms are recognized? Verse 5.
    NOTE.—"One baptism." This is the baptisin of which the apostle
speaks in Romans 6:3-6. It shows in its symbolism, which is immer-
sion, faith in the death, burial, and resurrection of our Lord. It is the
outward ceremony which symbolizes the death of the "old man" and
the union of the "new man" to Christ Jesus. Gal. 3:27.
    11. What is the last and greatest of these seven unities? Verse 6.
    NOTE.—Sin has interfered with God's plan in a measure, and God
has suffered it. For this reason we see all creation groaning and
travailing in pain together, in a thousand different ways on this sin-
cursed earth. But God calls wandering sinners to break truce with sin.
He calls all to return and be sons and daughters of God. Those who
yield to Him will be saved and transformed. The faithful will become
immortal sons of God, and the whole groaning creation "shall be de-.
livered from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory of
                                    251
the children of God." Rom. 8:19-22, A. R. V. It is for this that God
waits, the triumph of His purpose of the ages.
    12. In God's great purpose, what is given to every one? Verse 7.
    NOTE.—The Lord takes into consideration the individual members
of the church and invests each one with a gift of grace to minister
more effectively for Him.
    13. What scripture is quoted in proof of the bestowal of these
gifts?• Verse 8; Ps. 68:18.
    NOTE.—See the parables of the pounds and the talents. Luke 19:
11-13; Matt. 25:14, 15. "The talents that Christ intrusts to His
church represent especially the gifts and blessings imparted by the
Holy Spirit. . . . The gifts are already ours in Christ, but their actual
possession depends upon our reception of the Spirit of God."—"Christ's
Object Lessons," p. 327.
    The captives, "a multitude of captives" (margin), were those raised
from the dead when our Lord was raised, and who ascended with Him
as the trophies of His triumph over sin. Matt. 27:52, 53.

   14. What did Jesus do before He ascended? Verse 9.
   15. Why did He descend and ascend? How much is implied in the
descending and ascending of Christ, the Son of God? Verse 10.
    NOTE.—This wonderful parenthesis of verses 9 and 10 means much.
First our Lord descended. Before sin He was with the Father, the
Creator under the Father. When sin entered, He gave Himself to save
the lost, came down from the throne of the Highest, and took upon
Himself the likeness of sinful flesh, became sin that all who believe in
Him might in Him be made the righteousness of God. 2 Cor. 5:21. He
was denied, insulted, tormented, crucified. He went to the very lowest
depths of human woe, down to the awful nothingness of all,—death,---
to redeem those who received all blessings from Him, yet were in re-
bellion against Him. But death could not hold Him, the righteous
One, for perfect righteousness is life forevermore. Therefore, God
brought Him out of the tomb and "bath highly exalted Him, and given
Him a name which is above every name."
                       PERSONAL APPLICATION
   1.   Do I appreciate the great honor of God's call to met
   2.   Am I walking worthy of His calling?
   3.   Am I one with the Father?
   4.   Do I accept the gifts and blessings imparted by the Holy Spirit/


   "It should be our first care to render our free-will offerings to God.
Every manifestation of His mercy and love toward us should be grate-
fully acknowledged, both by acts of devotion and by gifts to His
cause."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 106.

                                 THE LESSON
   1. Upon how many are the gifts of God's grace bestowed? Eph.
4:7.
   NoTE.—Literally, "to each one," Every soul who receives Christ
receives in Him not alone the Holy Spirit in general, but at least one
spiritual gift in particular. 1 Cor. 12:7, 11. If we are Christ's, we may
definitely conclude that we have some divine gift for service, and we
may have confidence in Him in the use of that gift to the glory of
His name.
    2. From what source do these gifts come? 1 Cor. 12:4-6.
    NoTE.—"God has different ways of working, and He has different
workmen to whom He intrusts varied gifts. One worker may be a
ready speaker; another a ready writer; another may have the gift of
sincere, earnest, fervent prayer; another the gift of singing; another
may have special power to explain the word of God with clearness.
And each gift is to become a power for God, because He work's with
the laborer. To one God gives the word of wisdom, to another knowl-
edge, to another faith; but all are to work tinder the same Head. The
                                   1271
 diversity of gifts leads to a diversity of operations; but 'it is the same
 God which worketh all in all.' "—"Testimonies," Vol. 9, pp. 144, 145.
     3. Who alone can wisely distribute these gifts? 1 Cor. 12:11.
     NomE.—Man does not know his own powers and abilities, conse-
 quently he could not wisely choose the gift adapted to him. But God
 knows. By His Spirit He bestows, divides as He will, according to
 man's ability, the gifts which will develop man's usefulness in the
 Lord's service. His choice is better than our choice in proportion as
 His wisdom is higher, more comprehensive than ours.
     4. Where are these gifts set by our Father? 1 Cor. 12:28, first
 part.
     5. What illustrations or representations of these gifts are named in
 our lesson? Eph. 4:11.
     NoTE.—The gifts in Ephesians are noted in the gifted persons,—
 apdstles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, teachers. In 1 Corinthians 12:
4-10, they are noted as gifts which enable man to be what God desires.
 But in verse 28 of that chapter they appear again as persons endowed.
 First we have "apostles," sent forth as ambassadors of God, to found
 churches and guide them. They have authority from God; they also
 often had the gifts of prophecy and evangelism, and were pastors, and
 teachers. Prophets possess the gifts of revelation and enlightenment,
 and oftentimes more. Evangelists are to proclaim the gospel, and so
 convert men to God. Pastors are to care for the flock of God, as
shepherds care for their sheep. They are to teach and feed the church,
 warn and exhort, and labor to present every one under their care
 perfect in Christ Jesus. The "teachers" are to instruct young and
old in the word of God. About a score of enabling gifts are mentioned
in Romans 12 :3-6; 1 Corinthians 12:8-10; Ephesians 4:11.
    6. What are the purposes of the gifts? Verse 12.
    NOTE.—God places His Spirit and spiritual gifts upon His people
first of all to develop perfection of character, as predestinated or
marked out by God in the beginning. The church is to be a divine
school in a world of sin, with every gift in operation as needed, in
order to build up the church of God through the addition of souls, and
training them for service.
     7. What illustration is used to show the necessity and benefit of
these gifts in the church? 1 Cor. 12:12-27.
    NOTE.—The illustration is of the human body and its members.
The various organs and members of the body do not work for them-
selves, but for the other members. Each is served by all the others, and
so God designed that it should be in His church. The perfecting of
God's church, the building up of His saints in character and service,
must come through a reception and a recognition of these gifts, not
in ourselves alone, but in others as well. There must be a willingness
to learn and receive .from others those things in which we ourselves
may be lacking; and at the same time give to others that which God
in His own way has bestowed upon us for their sake.
    8. For how long were the gifts set in the church? Eph. 4:13.
                                   [ 28 l
    NOTE.—"Till." How frequently are we told that these gifts ceased
with the apostolic age. But the apostle does not so teach, neither did
Jesus. The people of God have not yet reached their full stature. They
do not stand blameless before God. Unsightly g`pots still mar the
beauty of God's spiritual building. The gifts of God are needed to
reveal the imperfections, cut them away, polish and refine the living
stones, till each one perfectly reflects the glory of Christ's character.
    9. The reception of what one gift prepares the way for all others?
1 Cor.
    NoTE.—"Even as." Note the desire expressed that the church
should be enriched in everything needed, "even as the testimony of
Christ was confirmed in you: so that ye come behind in no gift." "The
testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy." Rev. 19:10. This gift
will be in the remnant church, which keeps the commandments of God
and has the faith of Jesus. Rev. 12:17; 14:12.
    "Confirmed in us" means Spirit-filled men and women of God. •
  t 10. Against what will these gifts guard us? Eph. 4:14.
    NoTE.—"No more children." We love children, but it stirs our pro-
foundest pity if they always remain children, needing to be coddled
and petted and carried. There are children in God's church Who ought
to be strong men and women,—burden bearers,—instead of having to
be carried, amused, petted, coaxed.
    "Every wind of doctrine." The thought is plural. God's doctrine,
or teaching, is one, always in the singular; it is the doctrine according
to godliness. In Satan's repertoire there are various contradictory
doctrines. See Col. 2:22; 1 Tim. 4:1; Heb. 13:9. "Every wind of
doctrine" indicates many winds of doctrine,—evil winds which blow to
and fro upon the light and uncertain craft of the undecided.
    11. Receiving and speaking the truth in all sincerity, to what ex-
tent is Christian growth possible? Verse 15.
    12. What beautiful figure of Christian growth is given by the
apostle? Verse 16.
    NOTE.—The thought of the verse, the illustration of a well-
developed human body, is that of a perfectly functioning church.
Christ in all His fullness is the head. The church with all its diversity
of members and gifts is the body. From Christ she received her very
existence, her life, her all. The church feeds on His living word. She
is filled with the life and power of His Spirit. Through the Spirit she
receives a great variety of spiritual gifts for ministry or service,,each
gift for its designed purpose. Each of these, according to its supply,
works for the upbuilding of the church and the glory of her Head.
What diversity in members and gifts, and what divine -unity is here
manifest I
                        PERSONAL APPLICATION
    1. Have I experienced failures because I have tried to do God's
work in my own strength?
     2. Does my work bring praise to myself I or does it glorify God?
    3. Do I regard crosses and burdens as opportunities and blessings/
    4. What will keep me from being led away by false doctrine?

LESSON SCRIPTURE: Eph. 4: 17-32.
MEMORY VERSE: "Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth,
   but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto
   the hearers." Eph. 4: 29.
                        Suggestions for Daily Family Study

7. Review the lessons, memory verses, and Memory Gem. Consider "Personal
    Applications." Discuss topics in the junior lesson under the heading, "Some-
    thing to Think About."
                                  THE LESSON .
    1. In view of the past instruction given by the apostle Paul, bow
are we not to walk? Eph. 4:17.
    NOTE.—"Testify." Solemnly declare. Christians are to walk as
Christ walked.
    2. How do the Gentiles walk? Verse 17, last part; 18.
    NOTE.—"In the vanity,"—"emptiness,"-=of mind; nothing sub-
stantial, good, or lasting.
    "Understanding darkened." They do not know the light. They
have turned from the life which God gives through Christ. Thus, be-
cause they shut God from their knowledge, and walked in their own
way in sin, their heart became hardened.
    3. To what condition does willful blindness lead? Verse 19.
    NOTE.—Separated from God and from all knowledge of Him, they
plunge greedily into the lowest depths of sin. Romans 1:18-32 is a
description of the life that shuts out God.
    4. What contrast is seen in the life of the child of God? Verses
20, 21.
                                  [ 30 ]
   5. To what change in the life does the apostle first direct attention?
Verse 22.
    NOTE.—The word "conversation" means "general course of conduct
or habits; deportment." The American Revised Version reads: "That
ye put away, as concerning your former manner of life, the old man,"
that is, the way in which we used to walk when we were sinners, before
we knew Christ. It means the old unregenerate self. Man can not put
it away himself; he must be born from above.
   6. What is our necessity and privilege? Verse 23.
   7. What are we to put on in the place of the discarded old man?
Verse 24, first part.
   8. What is the origin of the new man? Verse 24, last part.
   NOTE.—Not a change in the "old man," not the "old man" made
over, but a new man, a new birth, Christ formed within. The law of
the Spirit of life in our hearts makes us free from sin and death.
See Rom. 8:2; 2 Cor. 5:17.
   9. How are we to speak? What reason is given for proving true to
our calling? Verse 25.
   10. What is said regarding anger? Should we hold anger in our
heart? Verse 26.
   NoTE.—It is well to have righteous indignation against wrong,
oppression, slavery, cruelty,persecution, intolerance. But' in it all we
must cherish pity, love, and mercy toward the deceived wrongdoer.
    11. What warning is given us when we are aroused by evil acts of
others? Verse 27.
    12. What instruction is given to those who formerly stole? Verse
28.
    NOTE.—This verse states a great principle, namely, amendment of
life. "Let him that stole steal no more" means, Let him that violated
any part of the divine law, cease thus to sin against God. Obedience,—
a life animated by. a "faith that works by love" (Gal. 5:6), and so
transforms the character that the graces of the Spirit appear where
once were seen only the fruits of the flesh,—is evidence of genuine
conversion.
   13. What instruction is given regarding their conversation or
speech? Verse 29.
    NOTE.—"Harsh expressions grieve the Lord; unwise words do
harm         Be gentle in your speech; watch well your words; let no
harshness come into your utterances or into your gestures. Bring into
all you do and say the fragrance of Christlikeness."—"Gospel Work-
ers," p. 163.
    14. How should we regard God's Holy Spirit? Verse 30. •
   NOTE.—The connection shows that it will be by lying, wrath, dis-
honesty, and corrupt conversation that the Spirit will be grieved. At
the time of our adoption, we were sealed (Eph. 1:13, 14), and then
                               [ 311
received the earnest of the Spirit, which it is God's purpose should
be retained and received in ever-increasing abundance up to the day
of final redemption or- deliverance. Yet we are warned that the Spirit,
though once given, may be resisted (Acts 7:51), vexed (Isa. 63:10),
grieved (Eph. 4:30), quenched (1 Thess. 5:19), so as to depart from
us. There is no security of final salvation to any person from his hav-
ing been adopted in Christ and sealed by the Spirit. We should see
to it that we break not the seal.
    "Men have the power to quench the Spirit of God; the power of
choosing is left with them. They are allowed freedom of action. . . .
The Spirit of God is continually convicting, and souls are deciding for
or against the truth. How important, then, that every act of life be
such that it need not be repented Of, especially among the ambassadors
of Christ, who are acting in His stead!"—"Gospel Workers," p. 174.
    15. What evil things should be put away? Verse 31.
    16. How should we regard each other? Verse 32.
    NpTE.—"Nothing can justify an unforgiving spirit. He who is
unmerciful toward others shows that he himself is not a partaker of
God's pardoning grace. In God's forgiveness the heart of the erring
one is drawn close to the great heart of Infinite Love: The tide of
divine compassion flows into the sinner's soul, and from Him to the
souls of others. The tenderness and mercy that Christ has revealed in
His own precious life will be seen in those who become sharers of His
grace."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 251.
                       PERSONAL APPLICATION
    1. Am I learning from Christ how to use the blessing of speech?
    2. Does the world still hold me, so that I long for 'its fellowship?
    3. Am I inclined to shade the truth if it will profit me?
    4. Do I forgive as I desire to be forgiven?

MEMORY VERSE: "See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as
   wise, redeeming the time, because the days are evil." Eph. 5: 15, 16.

                       Suggestions for Daily Family Study

7. Review the lessons, memory verses, and Memory Gem. Consider "Personal
    Applications." Discuss topics in the junior lesson under the heading "Can
    You Imagine?"
                               THE LESSON
    1. In view of our responsibilities as Christians, how does Paul ad-
monish us? Eph. 5:1.
   NoTE.—"Followers." As children loved of God, as children in whom
God's love has found response, our heavenly Father as exemplified M.
His Son is the only example safe to imitate.
  • 2. After what manner should we walk? Verse 2.
    3. What should wholly be banished from our lives? Verses 3, 4.
   NOTE.—That which is low, vulgar, base, or evil should not be
themes of conversation among us.
   "Covetousness" means more than the love of money. It means an
unlawful desire to have that which the heart longs for. Therefore
covetousness is called idolatry.
    4.'What is God's substitute for such evil things? Verse 4, last part.
    NOTE.—"God desired that the whole life of His people should be a
life of praise. ...
    "The Lord desires us to appreciate the great plan of redemption, to
realize our high privilege as the children of God, and to walk before
Him in obedience, with grateful thanksgiving. . • . To praise God in
fullness and sincerity of heart is as much a duty as is prayer. . . . Far
more than we do, we need to speak of the precious chapters in our expe-
rience."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 299.
   5. Regarding these forbidden things, what do we know? Verse 5.
   6. Against what are we to be guarded? What will deceitful words
bring upon the disobedient? Verse 6.
   NOTE.—"Vain words,"—plausible words which deceive, and explain
away the sins of the world. They are sins, and sins and saints have
nothing in common.
    7. What appeal is made to the followers of the Lord Jesus?
Verse 7.
    8. What change had they already experienced? What are they
called? Verse 8.
                                     1331
   9. What fruit is borne by the "children of light"? Verse 9.
    10. What will walking as "children of light" do for us? Verse 10.
   NOTE.—Walking in the light of the Lord will bring to the child of
God the constant proof that His ways are pleasing to God. He will
have with him the joy of salvation, and will be upheld with a willing
spirit. Ps. 51:12, 13.
    11. With what should we have no fellowship? Verse 11.
    12. Can there be fellowship between light and darkness? 2 Cor.
6:15, 16.
    NoTE.—"Reprove them," not always with words, for that may not
be wise. A discreet silence and avoidance of these works of, darkness
may sometimes be better. Let our conduct be such that it will arouse
inquiry or conviction rather than express disapproval. "Those who
have learned of Christ will 'have no fellowship with the unfruitful
works of darkness.' In speech, as in life, they will be simple, straight-
forward, and true; for they are preparing for the fellowship of those
holy ones in whose mouth is found no guile."—"Prophets and Kings,"
p. 252.
    13. What is said of these unfruitful works of darkness? Eph. 5:12.
    NOTE.—Eternal life demands that no foreign element shall donii-
nate the life of the Christian, or lower his holy regard for God's
standard of conduct. It is Satan's studied effort to present things
which will not shock the Christian much, and so lead him on to things
of which it is a shame to speak.
                 "Vice is a monster of so frightful mien,
                  As to be hated needs but to be seen;
                  Yet seen too oft, familiar with her face,
                  We first endure, then pity, then embrace."
                                                     —Pope.
     14. What ought the light of God's word to do for us? Verse 13.
     NOTE.—"Manifestation can come only through light. Whatever is
revealed in its true essence by light is of the nature of light. It no
longer belongs to the category of darkness. . . . That which is of the
truth seeks the light and cometh to the light. That which is evil avoids
the light, and loves darkness better than light, but none the less is
brought to the light and appears in its own light. See John 3:20, 21.
. . . By suffering the. tares to grow, their difference from the wheat,
which at first is not apparent, is fully revealed."—Vincent. Wise, true,
faithful Christian conduct is letting the light shine; and the shining
light of Christ in word or conduct will reprove sin.
     15. Where, and where only, may we find the light? Verse 14; Isa.
60:1; 62:1.
     16. What, then, are we admonished to do? Eph. 5:15.
     NorrE.—The American Revised Version. reads: "Look therefore
carefully how ye walk," referring to the unfruitful works,—verse 11.
     "Circumspectly,"—cautiously, careful of consequence.
   17. What should the evil days lead us to do? Verse 16.
                               (341
   NoTE.—The American Revised Version margin states it thus:
"Buying up the opportunity, because the days are evil." Conformity to
the world,—feasting, fashions, food, parties, etc.,—will never buy op-
portunities to save souls. But a strong, true, sweet Christian char-
acter which denies itself these things, will arouse inquiry, and will
secure opportunities to speak for God. So buy up opportunities for
God that the evil days may be to you fruitful days for good.
    18. How is duty again pressed home? What is our privilege?
Verse 17.
    19. What should be substituted for the world's excesses? Verse 18.
    20. What will help to build up Christian fellowship among our-
selves and bring us nearer to each other and to God? Verses 19-21.
    NOTE.—"As the children of Israel, journeying through the wilder-
ness, cheered their way by the music of sacred song, so God bids His
children to-day gladden their pilgrim life. There are few means more
effective for fixing His words in the memory than repeating them in
song."—"Education," p. 167.
                       PERSONAL APPLICATION
    1. Do I delight in talking of the things that are evil?
    2. Am I in fellowship with the world or with Christ?
    3. Am I buying up the opportunities to help others, and to witness
for God?

 PRACTICAL CHRISTIAN LIFE IN THE HOME
                            March 24, 1928
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Eph. 5: 22 to 6: 9.
MEMORY VERSE: "That He might present it to Himself a glorious church,

    thing to Think About."
                           THE LESSON
   1. Introducing the subject of proper family relations, what are
wives enjoined to do? Eph. 5:22.
   2. In God's plan, what is the husband to be? Verse 23.
   3. What example of subjection is given? Verse 24.
    NOTE.—"Marriage, a union for life, is a symbol of the union be-
tween Christ and His church. The spirit that Christ manifests toward
the church is the spirit that husband and wife are to manifest toward
each other. Neither husband nor wife is to make a plea for rulership.
The Lord has laid down the principle that is to guide in this matter.
The husband is to cherish his wife as Christ cherishes the church. And
the wife is to respect and love her husband. Both are to cultivate the
spirit of kindness, being determined never to grieve or injure the
other."—"Testimonies," Vol. 7, pp. 46, 47.
   4. What are husbands enjoined to do? Verse 25.
    NOTE.—"Neither the husband nor the wife should merge his or her
individuality in that of the other. Each has a personal relation to God.
Of Him each is to ask, 'What is right?"What is wrong?' How may
I best fulfill life's purpose?' . . . Neither the husband nor the wife
should attempt to exercise over the other an arbitrary controL Do not
try to compel each other to yield to your wishes. You can not do this
and retain each other's love."—"Ministry of Healing," p. 361.
   5. What was our Lord's purpose for the church? Verses 26, 27.
   6. If this is to be true of the church, what will it mean to individ-
ual members? Rev. 14:5; Zeph. 3:13.
   NOTE—It is necessary if the whole is to be perfect to have every
part perfect also. No chain can be strong if one of its links is weak.
No wall is perfect that contains crumbling stone or defective mortar.
We can not, if imperfect, pass the approval of the great Inspector by
being assembled with perfect ones.
   7. What lesson is drawn for the husband from Christ's purpose con-
cerning His church? Eph. 5:28, 29.
   8. What other relationship ought to hold husband and wife in the
bonds of peace? Verse 30.
    NOTE.—"His flesh, and of his bones." This seems to be a reference
to the words of Adam, "This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my
flesh." Gen. 2:23.
   9. How strong is the true union of marriage? Verse 31; Gen. 2:24.
                                    [ 36
     10. What lesson is again brought home to us? Eph. 5:32.
     NOTE.—This mystery of union with Christ is treated in Ephesians,
chapters 1-3. All true unions sanctioned of God are subject to the
same principles that exist between Christ and His church. Christ is in
the church, and Christ is in each member,—"Christ in you, the hope of
glory."
     11. What is the apostle's parting word to husband and wife?
Verse 33.
     NomE.—"Though difficulties, perplexities, and discouragements may
arise, let neither husband nor wife harbor they thought that their union
is a mistake or a disappointment. Determine to be all that it is possible
to be to each other. Continue the early attentions. In every way en-
 courage each other in fighting the battles of life. Study to advance the
happiness of each other. Let there be mutual love, mutual forbear-
ance. Then marriage, instead of being the end of love, will be as it
 were the very beginning of love. The warmth of true friendship, the
 love that binds heart to heart, is a foretaste of the joys of heaven."—
 "Ministry of Healing," p. 360.
     12. What is the duty of children? Eph. 6:1.
     13. To what great law does the apostle refer? Verses 2, 3; Ex.
20:12.
      14. What are parents to remember? Eph. 6:4.
      NOTE.—In a personal testimony given to parents many yeais ago,
 warnings in harmony with this scripture are strongly set forth: "You
 have robbed your children of their rights by not interesting yourself
  in their education, and instructing them patiently and faithfully in
  regard to forming characters for heaven. Your course has done much
  to destroy their confidence in you. You are exacting, overbearing, ty-
  rannical; you fret, and scold, and censure, and by so doing wean their
  affections from you. You treat them as though they had no just rights,
  as though they were machines to turn in your hands according to your
  pleasure. You provoke them to wrath, and often discourage them.
  You do not give them love and affection. Love begets love, affection
  begets affection. The spirit which you manifest toward your children
  will be reflected upon you."—"Testimonies," Vol. 2, pp. 94, 95.
      15. What instruction is given to servants? Verse 5.
      16. What is the character of the service the Christian servant
  should render? Verse 6.
       17. Whom really are they to remember that they are serving?
   Verses 7, 8.
       18. What instruction is given to masters?. Verse 9.
  ' 'Mt.:in.—Masters are to be true and just- and kind, as is. their
   Master, the Lord Jesus, for they, as truly as the servant; have a
   Master in 'heaven, and the rights of the lowest are to Him sacred, re-
   gardless of his condition or position.
                                     C37 ]
                        PERSONAL APPLICATION
  1. In my marriage relation, do I want to serve and bless, or do I
want only to be served?
  2. Do I treat those who are in my employ as I would have the
Master in heaven treat me?
  3. How do I treat my parents? my children?

                               THE LESSON
    1. How does the apostle begin his final injunction? Eph. 6:10.
    NomE.—Not by human wisdom, not by knowledge, skill, art, or hu-
man combinations, not by any of these singly or altogether, do men
stand for God and eternal life, but only by the power and might of God.
    2. With what must the soldier of Christ be protected? Verse 11.
    NOTE.—"The armor," literally the panoply,—a complete suit of
defensive armor,—supplied by God. During Paul's two years of im-
prisonment, men with complete Roman armor were always in evidence.
There were the breastplate, the girdle; the shoes, or greaves, the helmet,
the shield; the. Sword.
  - "Those.who will put on the whole armor of God, and devote some
time every day to meditation and prayer, and to the study of the
Scriptures, will be connected with Heaven, and will have a saving,
                                    1 38 ]
transforming influence upon those around them."—"Testimonies," Vol.
5, p. 112.
     3. What are the foes the Christian must meet? Verse 12.
     NoTE.—The Christian is not at war with men. He is a messenger
of peace to men who are in rebellion against God. His warfare is
spiritual, not physical; it is against those evil demons, angels of Satan,
who stir to the basest purposes men who will yield to them. His war-
fare is against the spiritual hosts of wickedness in the "heavenly."
(Margin.) The Syriac reads, "The evil spirits that are beneath
heaven." See also Rev. 12:9, 12.
     4. How only can these foes be overcome? Verse 13.
     NOTE.—"Take unto you" was a technical military term in Paul's
day, but he uses it for a different class of persons and for a different
purpose. It is no ordinary time for which the Christian is to prepare.
There are days of evil, dark days, when the demon hosts thickly gather
to deceive, seduce, destroy. Sometimes we see no foe, and all appears
to be peace and quietness. Yet the Christian is to stand, watchful,
waiting, ready to respond immediately to the call of the Captain.
     5. What are the first two parts of the armor mentioned? Verse 14.
     Nom—Your armor is complete, "stand therefore." Of that armor,
first is named "the girdle," encircling the body below the breastplate,
holding the armor in place, and holding the sheath of the sword. But
the Christian's girdle is truth. The strength and consistency of truth
holds his defensive armor in place and carries his only offensive equip-
ment, the sword of the Word. Error has no place where truth controls.
     "The breastplate of righteousness." Prophetically, "righteousness"
 is the breastplate of Jesus. Isa. 59:17. The breastplate covers the
 heart, the seat of the affections, the emotions; and the dominant thing
in the heart of the Christian soldier is righteousness.
     6. What is mentioned next in the armor of the Christian? Verse
15; Isa. 52:7.
     7. What is then urged as necessary? Eph. 6:16.
     NOTE.—"Above all." The shield covers or protects the entire person
 of the soldier. The shield of faith rests in the person of Christ, and
 puts Christ before us in all the attacks of the enemy. The great shields
 used in warfare were sometimes four feet long by two and one-half
 feet wide. Does not the shield as mentioned in Psalm 5:12 express the
 confidence that God can and will protect us from our enemy'1
     8. What special protection is provided for the head? Verse 17,
 first part.
      NOTE.—"Helmet." (See Isa. 59:1 7.; 1 Thess. 5:8.) Inspiration
 places "hope" in the helmet, coveting the brain, the intellect. God
  wants us to have an intelligent hope,- based on what He says, and on
 our acceptance of His word by faith..                •
      9. What is the only weapon given? Verse 17, last part.
                                    39
    NOTE.—"The sword of the Spirit." That is the Christian's only
 weapon of offense,. the word of God, the mighty gospel message. This
is the sword that is "two-edged" (Heb. 4:12), that reveals the deadly
enemy, sin, and when used, destroys the power of sin. It is the word
given by the Spirit of God, and it is the Spirit that makes it effective
in cleansing the Christian (John 15:3), in saving sinners, and in keep-
ing from sin. Let it not hang idle in the girdle of truth, but with
shield in the left hand and sword in the right, go forth to win souls
from sin to Christ. "We need not say, The perils of the last days are
soon to come upon us. Already they have come. We need now the
sword of the Lord to cut to the very soul and marrow of fleshly lusts,
appetites, and passions. Minds that have been given up to loose
thought need to change. . . Our efforts, our self-denial, our persever-
ance, must be proportionate to the infinite value of the object of which
we are in pursuit."—"Testimonies," Vol. 8, p. 315.
    10. Upon what must the Christian depend in his warfare? Verse 18.
    NOTE.—"Praying always." By prayer, silent and vocal, private
and public, we should keep in touch with God. Persevere in prayer,
pray through. Not always should we pray for self alone, but our
prayers should include all of God's children.
    11. What does the apostle ask for himself? Verse 19.
    NomE.—"For me." How the heart of that man of God must have
longed for human sympathy in his need! Paul had labored and prayed
for the church in Ephesus; and now he pleads for their prayers, not
for his physical comfort, but that he might have utterance and bold-
ness to continue to make known the wonderful mystery of the gospel
of salvation.
    12. How does he describe his situation? Verse 20.
    13. What faithful messenger did he send to Ephesus? For what
purposes was he to go? Verses 21, 22.
    14. With what words of blessing does he close? Verses 23, 24.
                     PERSONAL APPLICATION
  1. Have I on the whole armor of God? Am I skillful in using the
weapons provided?
   2. When trial comes, do I give up, or pray through?
   3. In what special ways have I been helped by the study of the
Book of Ephesians?
