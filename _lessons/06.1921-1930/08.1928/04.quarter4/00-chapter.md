                    Parts II and III
                  By M. L. Andreasen
    The Sabbath school lessons for this quarter are a contin-
uation of studies from the book of Isaiah; they will continue
through the first quarter of 1929. Lesson helps have been
prepared by Elder M. L. Andreasen. These are being published
in three volumes, one for each quarter. The writer is a keen
Bible student, and his comments on the book of Isaiah will be
indispensable to Sabbath school officers and teachers. Every
member also of the Sabbath school should have these booklets,
for special help on the lessons is needed.
    Volume II is now ready, and Volume III will be ready
 December 1. Price of each, 25 cents; in Canada, 30 cents.
Order the two volumes now for 50 cents (in Canada, 60 cents) ;
and your Book and Bible House will mail Volume III as soon
as it is ready.

                  LESSON 1 — OCTOBER 6, 1928
                 "BEHOLD YOUR GOD!"
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Isaiah 40.
MEMORY VERSE: Isa. 40: 9.
                            INTRODUCTION
     Many of the chapters we shall study this quarter have a special ap-
plication to the latter days. This is true of chapter forty. The keynote
of the chapter is, Behold your God! Behold Him as Creator, Saviour,
Judge, Shepherd, and coming King. Help on this chapter may be found
in "The Desire of Ages," pp. 132-135.
                              THE LESSON
     1. What message does God send to His people? Isa. 40:1, 2.
     NOTE.—Sin, wherever found, is abhorrent to God, but doubly so in
the case of those who know the truth. Light brings responsibility.
Those who know the truth and still persist in sin are more guilty than
those who do not have a knowledge of God's message for this time.
For this reason God's people have received double punishment. But
God does not hate His people any more than the gardener hates the
vine which he prunes. God loves His people, and sends them a mes-
sage of comfort and love.                                         •
     2. What message is proclaimed by "the voice"? Who is spoken of
as having fullled this scripture? Verses 3-5; Matt. 3:1-3.
     NOTE.—"In this age, just prior to the second coming of Christ in
the clouds of heaven, such a work as that of John is to be done. God
calls for men who will prepare a people to stand in the great day of
the Lord. The message preceding the public ministry of Christ was,
'Repent; publicans and sinners; repent, Pharisees and Sadducees;
"repent ye; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."' . . .
     "In order to give such a message as John gave, we must have a
spiritual experience like his. The same work must be wrought in us.
 We must behold God, and in beholding Him lose sight of self."—"Tes-
 timonies," Vol. 8, pp. 332, 333.
     3. What further does "the voice" say? What is all flesh said to be?
 In contrast with this, what is said of the word of our God? Isa. 40:6-8.
     NoTE.—Man and his wisdom shall perish; but "the word of our
 God" shall stand forever. Men's theories will go down. Their ideas
 of future peace and of a millennium will not bear the test of "the
 word." It is well to build on something that will "stand" when every-
 thing else is shaken.
     4. Where are those who bring good tidings instructed to go? What
 is Jerusalem to do? What are the people of God to say to the cities?
 Verse 9.
     NoTE.—The message is not to be given in a corner. The messenger
 is to get up into a high mountain where all can see and hear, and lift
 up the voice with strength. This is nothing but "the loud cry." And
 the first part of the message is, "Behold your God!"
                                      3
    "The children of God are to manifest His glory. In their own life
and character they are to reveal what the grace of God has done for
them. The light of the Sun of Righteousness is to shine forth in good
works,—in words of truth and deeds of holiness."—"Christ's Object
Lessons," pp. 415, 416.
    5. What is a vital part of the message to be given? Verse 10.
    NOTE.—"The Lord God will come." This is the advent proclama-
tion, and should be the keynote of every message. The Lord will come
"with strong hand." He will "rule." Ps. 2:8, 9. He will also bring the
"reward" with Him. Rev. 22:12. The Lord will come to punish and to
reward.
    6. Under what symbol is Christ presented? How are His love and
care revealed? Verse 11; see also John 10:1-16.
    7. How does the prophet illustrate the mighty power of God? Isa.
40:12.
    8. What further questions are asked? Verses 13, 14.
    NOTE.—These questions are so put as to require the negative an-
swer. "No one,"—the strongest way in which such statements can be
placed. The positive would be, God has not been taught by anyone;
no one has shown Him "the way of understanding." That is, God is
the Original One, the Ultimate One, the Source of all things. There
was vie before Him. No one "instructed" or "taught" Him.
    9. To what is the importance of the nations compared? Verses
15-17.
    NOTE.—The dripping of a bucket or a little dust blown from the,
scales are not regarded as great or important. Yet if whole nations
are so counted, how much smaller must the individual be? And yet
puny man sets himself up against God, and attempts to teach Him!
Such indeed must be counted by Heaven "less than nothing, and
vanity."
    10. What shows that it is impossible to make any comparison to
the great God of heaven? How are idols made? Verses 18-20.
    NomE.—The inference is plain. God is the Creator. He has made
all things. Idols can not create. They themselves must be made.
    11. In what four ways is the question asked concerning our knowl-
edge of God? Where is God represented as sitting? What is said of
the inhabitants of earth? of princes and judges? Verses 21-23.
    12. How is the shortness of human life spoken of? Verse 24.
    NOTE.—The American Revised Version, margin, renders verse 24:
"Scarce are they planted, scarce are they sown, scarce hath their stock
taken root in the earth, when He bloweth upon them." That is, men
hardly begin to live ere they are taken away.
    13. In what words are the questions of verse 18 repeated? What
are we counseled to do? How are God's wisdom and power shown?
Verses 25, 26.
    NOTE.—"God calls upon His creatures to turn their attention from
the confusion and perplexity around them, and admire His handiwork.
                                   [4]
As we study His works, angels from heaven will be by our side, to
enlighten our minds, and guard them from Satan's deceptions. As you
look at the wonderful things that God's hand has made, let your proud,
foolish heart feel its dependence and inferiority. How terrible it is
when the acknowledgment of God is not made when it should be made!
How sad to humble one's self when it is too late!"—"Counsels to Teach-
ers," p. 457.     ,
    14. What do Jacob and Israel say? Verse 27.
    NOTE.—The complaint of Jacob and Israel seems to be that "my
way," that is, their course and condition of life, is hidden from the
Lord, and that "my judgment" or, rather, "my right," escapes His
notice. It is really a complaint from the people that God does not
pay enough attention to them, that He "passes them by."
    15. How does God meet the complaint of the people, and assure
them of His knowledge and of His care? Verses 28, 29.
    NOTE.—"There is no searching of His understanding." That-is, God
knows. You may think He does not know your perplexities, or, even
worse, that He does not care. Be assured, dear soul, God knows and
He cares. Your God not only understands, but He will give you the
needed power and increase your strength.
    "God's workers will meet with turmoil, discomfort, and weariness.
At times, uncertain and distracted, they are almost in despair. When
this restless nervousness comes, let them remember Christ's invitation,
Come apart, and rest awhile. The Saviour ‘giveth power to the faint;
and to them that have no might He increaseth strength.' "—"Testi-
monies," Vol. 7, p. 244.
    16. What may be the experience of the youth? What is noted of
them "that wait upon the Lord"? Verses 30, 31.
    NOTE.—"Remember that prayer is the source of your strength. A
worker can not gain success while he hurries through his prayers, and
 rushes away to look after something that he fears may be neglected
or forgotten. He gives only a few hurried thoughts to God; he does
 not take time to think, to pray, to wait upon the Lord fora renewal
 of physical and spiritual strength. He soon becomes weary. He does
 not feel the uplifting, inspiring influence of God's Spirit. He is not
 quickened by fresh life. His jaded frame and tired brain are not
 soothed by personal contact with Christ."—Id., p. 243. Read Ps. 27:14.


                  LESSON 2—OCTOBER 13, 1928
    JEHOVAH'S CHALLENGE TO FALSE GODS
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Isaiah 41.
MEMORY VERSE: Isa. 41: 10.
                             INTRODUCTION
     "Study the forty-first chapter of Isaiah, and strive to understand
it in all its significance."—"Testimonies," Vol. 8, p. 39.
     In Isaiah 40, God is presented as the Creator. In this chapter the
nations are challenged to appear and witness to God's foreknowledge.
                                   [5]
The Lord is about to tell them concerning the future, concerning one
"who hath raised up .one from the east, whom He calleth in righteous
ness to His foot." Isa. 41:2, English Revised Version. God will give
this man "the nations." He will give him "rule over kings." Verst
2. Though this man is unnamed as yet, he is without doubt Cyrus
mentioned by name first in Isaiah 44:28; 45:1, and many years before
he was born.
    God gives each man ample ground for faith. In this chapter He
says in substance to Israel, "I will foretell the future. By that you
may know that I am God. I challenge the idols to tell us what shall
come to pass. They can not do this. When I now tell you concerning
the man I will raise up and you see this come to pass just as I say,
then you may know that I am indeed the true God, the Creator of
heaven and earth."
    Help on this chapter may be found in "Prophets and Kings," pages
143-154, the challenge of Elijah to the false gods.
                            THE LESSON
    1. How does God address the islands and the people? Isa. 41:1.
    NOTE.—God calls the nations before Him. He is about to speak
to them, so He asks them to keep silence. After God has spoken, "then
let them speak."
    2. What questions does God ask? What would the "man from the
east" do? Verses 2, 3.
    NOTE.—The sense of these two verses may perhaps best be pre-
sented by this paraphrase: "Who hath raised up one from the east
who is always victorious? Who hath given him authority over the na-
tions, and made him rule over kings? His sword drives them like dust,
his bow like chaff before the wind. He pursues them and marches
forward safely and that so swiftly that he does not tread the path
with his feet."
    Cyrus is the "man from the east." See Introduction.
    3. Who had used Cyrus to do these things? How is God spoken
of? Verse 4.
    NOTE.—This verse does not say that God is the first and the last.
That indeed is true. Rev. 1: 11. But here it states that God is with
the last. Even as God was in the beginning, so He will be with His
people to the end, with the last.
    4. How is the cooperative spirit of the builders of idols described?
Verses 5-7.
    NOTE.—The prophet is here describing the condition which would
accompany the conquests of Cyrus. The islands and the nations would
be afraid; they would "draw near," but not to God. This drawing near
probably has reference to the league between Lydia, Babylon, and
Egypt against Cyrus. But instead of trusting God, they appeal to their
idols, and decide to make a particularly good and strong set of gods.
    "Well might the words written of the idol builders of old be, with
worthier aim, adopted as a motto by character builders of to-day:
`They helped every one his neighbor; and every one said to his brother,
Be of good courage.' "—"Education," p. 286.
                                  [6]
    5. How does God speak of His people? Whence have they come?
Verses 8, 9.
    NomE.—"Abraham my friend"! What a wonderful designation!
And we are the children of Abraham, God's friend. God's people will
come from the ends of the earth. They may not be perfect, but God
has not cast them away.
    6. Why should we not fear? Why not be dismayed? What ex-
ceedingly precious promises are given? Verse 10.
    7. What will be the experience of those who are incensed against
God's people? Verses 11, 12.
    8. How does God lead His people? Why need no one fear? What
two names are given to God? Verses 13, 14.
     9. What will God make of His people? What will God's people
do to the mountains? In whom will God's people glory? Verses 15, 16.
    NorE.—The time was to come when Israel should again reign. As
the instrument of the Almighty they would thresh the nations (moun-
tains). A day also lies just ahead when the Israel of God will no
longer be a savor of life to a rebellious world. No more will God
spare a world in rebellion because of the righteous remnant. Instead,
because of their rebellion and their oppression of His people, the
vials of His wrath will be poured upon them. The land will be emptied
and desolate (Rev. 5:14-17; Jer. 4:23-28) like Babylon of old (Jer.
51:2). But in that day God's people shall rejoice in Him and "glory
in the Holy One of Israel." (See Isa. 25:8, 9.)
     10. What precious promise does God give the poor and needy?
What will God open for them? Verses 17, 18.
     NOTE.—This text has a literal application as well as a spiritual
one. Speaking of the time of trouble, we read in "The Great Contro-
versy," page 629:
     "The people of God will not be free from suffering; but while
persecuted and distressed, while they endure privation, and suffer for
want of food, they will not be left to perish. That God who cared for
Elijah will not pass by one of His self-sacrificing children. He who
 numbers the hairs of their head will care for them; and in time of
 famine they shall be satisfied. While the wicked are dying from hun-
 ger and pestilence, angels will shield the righteous, and supply their
 wants. To him that 'walketh righteously' is the promise, 'Bread shall
 be given him; his waters shall be sure.' When the poor and needy
 seek water, and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirst, I
 the Lord will hear them, I the God of Israel will not forsake them.'"
     11. What will God plant in the wilderness and in the desert? Why
 does God do this? Verses 19, 20.
     NomE.—These trees are of the choicest. The desert itself shall be
 transformed into a grove of stately, beautiful trees. And the object
 is that men may see in this a demonstration of the creative power of
 God.
     12. What does God call upon the idols of the nations to do? What
 does He challenge them to show? Verses 21, 22.
                                  [7I
    13. How does God further challenge the idols? What does God
declare them to be? Verses 23, 24.
    NOTE.—God's challenge is definite, "Show us the future. Prove
your power to predict, or give any proof of life and activity." (See
Jer. 10:5.) God's idea of these idols is well expressed in the margin,
"worse than nothing," "worse than of a viper."
    14. Whom does God say He has raised up? What shall he do to
princes? Verse 25.
    NOTE.—Cyrus is here again introduced. He is said to have come
from the north, also from the east. In fact, he came from the east,
though all armies from the east came around the Arabian desert, and
hence attacked Palestine from the north.
    "Call upon My name." The Cambridge Bible, page 23, makes the
following comment: "It is true that in Isaiah 45:4 it is said that Cyrus
had not known Jehovah; but it is also said (verse 3) that the effect
of his remarkable successes will be 'that thou mayest know that I am
Jehovah that calleth thee by thy name, the God of Israel.' There is
therefore no difficulty in the idea that Cyrus, who was at first the un-
conscious instrument of Jehovah's purpose, shall at length recognize
that Jehovah was the true author of his success."
    15. What questions does God again ask concerning the idols?
Verse 26.
    16. What will God give to Jerusalem? Verse 27.
    NOTE.—The first part of verse 27 in the American Revised Version
reads, "I am the first that said unto Zion, Behold, behold them."
    17. What does God say He did not find among the idols? What
are they again declared to be? Verses 28, 29.


                  LESSON 3—OCTOBER 20, 1928

     THE ELECT OF GOD; A LIGHT OF THE
                GENTILES
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Isaiah 42.
MEMORY VERSE: Isa. 42: 3, 4.
                            INTRODUCTION
    The work of Christ is definitely set forth in this chapter. He is
the elect of God, a term which occurs six times in this portion of
Isaiah. He is gentle, quiet, compassionate. He does not come to crush
life, but to develop it; not to despise the weak, but to help them. If
there is but a dimly burning wick, He does not give up hope. He will
not stop until the work is accomplished. Many of the blind shall yet
see the light, and the whole earth shall praise the Lord.
                        THE LESSON
   1. What two names does the prophetic word give to Christ? What
has God put upon Him? What will He bring to the Gentiles? Isa. 42:1.
                               8
    NomE.—Christ is the servant (John 6:38), sent to do the Father's
will. He is the elect whom the Father has chosen, and whom He up-
holds.
    "Bring forth judgment." The word "judgment" occurs three times
in these first verses, and may be translated "law;" but commentators
agree that the word is used here in a larger sense, some rendering the
sentence thus: "He shall carry the true religion to the Gentiles."
   2. 'What will be the manner of Christ's working? Verse 2.
   NOTE.—Moffatt's translation is, "He shall not be loud and noisy,
He shall not shout in public."
   "In marked contrast to all this [the manner of the Pharisees] was
the life of Jesus. In that life no noisy disputation, no ostentatious
worship, no act to gain applause, was ever witnessed. Christ was hid
in God, and God was revealed in the character of His Son. To this
revelation Jesus desired the minds of the people to be directed, and
their homage to be given."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 261.
   3. 'What two examples show Christ's love and tenderness for the
weak? Verse 3, margin.
   NOTE.—There are few more beautiful passages in the Bible. The
reed may be bruised, Christ will not break it. The candle may burn
dimly, but He will not blow it out. There may not be much strength,
the life may be bruised and broken; there may not be much light,
rather smoke and darkness. But Christ does not give up hope. His
own light does not burn dimly. By gentle measures the smoking flax
may be fanned into a flame. His purpose shall not be broken, and the
true religion shall be extended to all the earth.
   4. What is Christ's attitude toward His work? 'What will He ac-
complish? For what do the isles wait? Verse 4.
   NOTE.—The words "fail" and "be discouraged" correspond in the
original to "dimly burning" and "broken" in verse 3. (See margin,
American Revised Version.)
   5. How is the true God revealed? Verse 5.
   NOTE.—Again and again the true God is mentioned as the Creator.
Here the reading really is, Thus saith the God who alone is truly God.
   "That which cometh out of it," probably refers to all that the earth
produces,—gold, silver, and vegetation.
   6. How does God speak of Christ's appointment to His work?
How will God sustain Him? For what will He give Him to the people
and to the Gentiles? Verse 6.
    7. 'What is further prophesied concerning the work of Christ?
Verse 7.
   8. What does God say of His name? What is said concerning the
Lord's glory and praise? Verse 8.
    9. What has been true of "the former things"? What is said of the
future? Verse 9.
    Nova.—The- former things which God had foretold had all been
fulfilled. He was now telling of new things. These would as surely
come to pass.
                                 [9]
   10. What are we exhorted to do? Who are to sing this song?
Verses 10-12.
    11. What is the Lord about to do? Verses 13-15.
    NOTE.—The reason for singing the new song is given in these verses.
God is about to manifest Himself. The second coming of Christ is
here brought to view. For a long time God has refrained Himself and
kept still when iniquity raised its ugly head. But now God will re-
strain Himself no more. He will go forth. He will prevail against
His enemies.
   12. What is God's promise to the blind? How will He lead them?
Verses 16-18.
   NOTE.—The blind here must have reference to the spiritually blind.
In "Prophets and Kings," page 378, this text is applied to "all the
honest in heart in heathen lands." There are many who are blind, but
honest. That which seems to them to be darkness will then be made
light, and the crooked things will be made straight. This should give
us hope for many who apparently are rejecting light.
    13. Who is spoken of as being blind and deaf? Though many
things may be seen and heard, what does the Lord's servant not do?
Verses 19, 20.
    NOTE.—"The terms 'My servant,' Israel,"the servant of the Lord,'
mean anyone that the Lord may select and appoint to do a certain
work. He makes them ministers of His will, though some who are
selected may be as ignorant of His will as was Nebuchadnezzar."—
"Testimonies," Vol. 9, p. 138.
    "God does not wish us to hear all that is to be heard, or to see all
that is to be seen. It is a great blessing to close the ears, that we hear
not, and the eyes, that we see not. The greatest anxiety should be to
have clear eyesight to discern our own shortcomings, and a quick ear
to catch all needed reproof and instruction, lest by our inattention and
carelessness we let them slip, and become forgetful hearers, and not
doers of the work."—"Testimonies," Vol. 1, pp. 707, 708.
    14. What is the Lord well pleased to do? Verse 21.
    NoTs.—"The beloved disciple, who listened to the words of Jesus
on the mount, writing long afterwards under the inspiration of the
Holy Spirit, speaks of the law as of perpetual obligation. He says
that 'sin is the transgression of the law,' and that 'whosoever commit-
teth sin transgresseth also the law.' He makes it plain that the law to
which he refers is 'an old commandment which ye had from the be-
ginning.' He is speaking of the law that existed at the creation, and
was reiterated upon Mount Sinai."—"Thoughts from the Mount of
Blessing," p. 77.
    "The third angel's message, embracing the messages of the first
and second angels, is the message for this time. We are to raise aloft
the banner on which is inscribed, 'The commandments of God, and
the faith of Jesus.' The world is soon to meet the great Lawgiver
over His broken law. This is not the time to put out of sight the great
issues before us. God calls upon His people to magnify the law, and
make it honorable."—"Testimonies," Vol. 8, p. 197.
                                   [ 10)
   15. What calamities had come upon God's people? What appeal
did the Lord make? Verses 22, 23.
   16. Who permitted the calamities to come? Why were they per-
mitted? Yet what did the people not do? Verses 24, 25.


                  LESSON 4—OCTOBER 27, 1928

   THE GATHERING OF ISRAEL; WITNESSES
               FOR GOD
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Isaiah 43.
MEMORY VERSE: Isa. 43: 25.
                            INTRODUCTION
    The lesson of this chapter centers around two main topics. The
first seven verses tell of God's great love for His people, His willing-
ness to make any sacrifice to insure their salvation, even to the lives of
men and of peoples, to make certain that no honest heart should be lost.
He then makes the promise that every member of His family, those
called by His name, should all be gathered to Himself.
    The second topic deals with the weighing of men in the balances,
a testing of their loyalty. God depends upon the witness of His chil-
dren. We are to testify of what He has done for us, of what we know
by personal experience. A witness is allowed to tell only of that which
he personally knows to be true. Now what has God done for your
God is looking for witnesses to testify to what He has done for them.
                               THE LESSON
    1. What comforting statement is made by the Lord to His people?
Isa. 43:1.
    NOTE.—"Fear not." This blessed assurance that we need not fear
is especially comforting in view of the last verses of the preceding
chapter, where it is stated that God will pour out His fury' against
them that walk not in His ways nor keep His law.
    "Called thee by thy name." "Jesus knows us individually, and is
touched with the feeling of our infirmities. He knows us all by name.
He knows the very house in which we live, the name of each occupant.
He has at times given directions to His servants to go to a certain
street in a certain city, to such a house, to find one of His sheep. Every
soul is as fully known to Jesus as if he were the only one for whom
the Saviour died."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 479.
    2. What promises are given to God's people when in trial?
Verses 2, 3.
    NomE.—God's promise to help His people has been wonderfully
fulfilled in the past. For example, see Daniel 3: 27 and Exodus 14:
21, 22. When the trials of the last days shall come, these promises will
become very precious indeed.
    "Often the church militant is called upon to suffer trial and afflic-
tion; for not without severe conflict is the church to triumph. 'The
                                     [
bread of adversity,' the water of affliction,' these are the common lot
of all; but none who put their trust in the One mighty to deliver will
be utterly overwhelmed."—"Prophets and Kings," p. 723.
   3. How much does God think of His people? Verse 4.
   NOTE.—God loves His people. He loves them so much that their
worth can not be expressed in terms of money. He would gladly give
Egypt, Ethiopia, and Seba for them. "I will give men for thee." That
which is of immeasurably greater value than silver or gold, than
property of any kind—men, human lives—God would give for His
people. He spared not His own Son, but freely gave Him. He has
permitted some of His own to give their lives for those "other sheep"
who have not known Him.
    4. Why need we not fear? From what parts of the earth will God
call His people? Verses 5, 6.
    NOTE.—This scripture is now being fulfilled. The message is sound-
ing in all parts of the earth, and God is calling men from every na-
tion, kindred, tongue, and people.
    5. What will those who come from the ends of the earth be called?
Why was man created? Verse 7.
    NOTE.—"Called by My name." Of a certain company it is written
that they will have the Father's name written in their foreheads. Rev.
14: 1. God's name is what He is. Ex. 3: 14. Hence, to be called by the
name of God means to have His character.
    6. What call does God now issue to all nations? What challenge
does He make? Verses 8, 9.
    NOTE.—God is calling all nations together as to a judgment scene.
"Let them bring forth their witnesses," He says. The question is,
Who is the true Gods He challenges them to "show us former things,"
that is, things that they have predicted and which have come to pass.
If they profess to do this, let them bring forth their witnesses to sup-
port their contention. If they can not do this, let them hear God's side
of the case and say, "It is truth."
    7. What does God call His people? What may they know, believe,
and understand? What does God say of Himself? Verse 10.
    NoTE.—"Our confession of His faithfulness is Heaven's chosen
agency for revealing Christ to the world. We are to acknowledge His
grace as made known through the holy men of old; but that which
will be most effectual is the testimony of our own experience. We are
witnesses for God as we reveal in ourselves the working of a power
that is divine. Every individual has a life distinct from all others,
and an experience differing essentially from theirs. God desires that
our praise shall ascend to Him, marked with our own individuality.
These precious acknowledgments to the praise of the glory of His grace,
when supported by a Christlike life, have an irresistible power, that
works for the salvation of souls."—"Ministry of Healing," p. 100.
    8. What does God say of Himself? What three things does God say
He has done to which His people are called to witness? Verses 11, 12.
                                   [ 12 ]
    NOTE.—"The people of the world are worshiping false gods. They
are to be turned from their false worship, not by hearing denuncia-
tion of their idols, but by beholding something better. God's goodness
is to be made known. 'Ye are My witnesses, saith the Lord, that I am
God.' "—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 299.
    As to being a witness, "This also we shall be in eternity."—"Edu-
cation," p. 308.
    "The redeemed only, of all created beings, have in their own ex-
perience known the actual conflict with sin; they have wrought with
Christ, and, as even the angels could not do, have entered into the fel-
lowship of His sufferings; will they have no testimony as to the science
of redemption,—nothing that will be of worth to unfallen beings I"—
Ibid.
    9. How does God declare His omnipotence? Verse 13.
    NOTE.—The first statement, "Before the day was I am He," is va-
riously translated. The sense seems to be, "I am ever the same." Be-
fore the day was, that is, before time began, "I am He." "From this
day forth I am He." American Revised Version, margin.
    10. How is the fall of Babylon announced? Verses 14-17.
    NOTE.—In these verses the fall of Babylon is announced, but in
very general terms. We are told that the chariot and horse, the army
and the power, shall lie down together and not rise again, that they
shall become extinct. When this calamity should come, His people
were to know that the Holy One, the Creator of Israel, is their King,
and that He will make a way for them in the sea and a path in the
mighty waters.
    11. What does God say His people are not to remember? What
will God do? Who shall show forth His praise? Verses 18-21.
    NomE.—These verses are evidently to be understood in a spiritual
sense. God will do a new thing. He will make a way in the wilderness,
and rivers in the desert, and there He will give drink to His people,
His chosen.
    12. What complaint does God bring against His people? What
have they not brought? With what has God not wearied them? Verses
22, 23.
     NOTE.—God's people have neglected prayers; they have become
weary of Him. What an indictment! Against this charge God defends
 Himself. He has not required very much of His people. He has not
 wearied them either with offerings or with incense.
     13. What further complaint does God make? What does He say
 they have done? Verse 24.
     NOTE.—God now speaks of His weariness of His people. "I have
 not caused thee to serve," He says, "but thou hast made Me to serve
 with thy sins." I have not "wearied thee with incense," but "thou
 hast wearied Me with thine iniquities." All power is of God. When
 we sin, we use for a base purpose the power God has given us. We
 make Him to serve with our sins. What a fearful condition!
     14. What does God say He is doing? Why? What will He not re-
 member? Verse 25.
                                  [ 13 ]
    NoTE.—It would be natural to expect God to be so weary with our
sins that He would turn us away. On the contrary, God blots out our
sins, not for our sakes, not because we deserve it, but for His own sake.
   15. Of what does God say we are to put Him in remembrance?
What invitation is given? Verse 26.
    NOTE.—The more probable interpretation is, "Put Me in remem-
brance of My promises; plead them before Me; declare them, that I
may justify thee." What a gracious invitation!
   16. Who has sinned? Who have transgressed? What was God
therefore forced to do? Verses 27, 28.
   Nomx.—"You have no good thing wherewith to come before Me.
Your first father sinned; your teachers have sinned. I have punished
them. If you escape, it is only because of My great mercy."


                 LESSON 5—NOVEMBER 3, 1928

  THE TRUE GOD; VANITY OF IDOLS; CYRUS,
             THE SHEPHERD
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Isaiah 44; 45: 1-4.
MEMORY VERSE: Isa. 44: 22.
                           INTRODUCTION
     God will pour out His Spirit, but only upon them that are thirsty.
Many will be converted also among the Gentiles and heathen. These
shall all acknowledge the true God and keep themselves from idols.
     Two things distinguish the true God from false gods. God is the
Creator. God is the God of prophecy. He can tell the future.
     We may not worship idols of wood and stone. But if we do not ac-
knowledge God as Creator, if we accept evolution as a substitute for
creation, we have formed another god and rejected the true One.
     God may use nations and kings to fulfill His word. So He did in
the case of Cyrus. Our faith should be strengthened as we see ful-
filled prophecy.
                            THE LESSON
    1. Whom is God addressing in the first verse of this lesson? How
does God again call attention to the fact that He is the Creator? Isa.
44:1, 2.
    NomE.—It is interesting to note how God uses every opportunity
to emphasize the fact of creation. Here He announces Himself as the
One who made and formed man.
    Jeshurun means the "upright one." It may here be used to show
the change from "Jacob, the supplanter."
    2. Upon whom will God pour water, symbolic of the Spirit? What
will be the result of this outpouring? Verses 3, 4.
    NomE.—"There are certain conditions upon which we may expect
that God will hear and answer our prayers. One of the first of these
                                 [ 14
is that we feel our need of help from Him. He has promised, will
pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground.'
Those who hunger and thirst after righteousness, who long after God,
may be sure that they will be filled. The heart must be open to the
Spirit's influence, or God's blessing can not be received."—"Steps to
Christ," p. 99.
     The result of the outpouring of the Spirit is the springing up here
and there of life,—new believers.
     3. What will one say? What will others do? Verse 5.
     Nov .—This verse tells of the ingathering of Gentiles as a result
of the outpouring of the Spirit.
     4. How does God speak of Himself? What proof does He present
to show that beside Him there is no god? Verses 6-8.
     NoTE.—God is here King, Redeemer, the First and the Last, the
 only One.
     A paraphrase of verse 7 would read: "Who is like Mel For since
 the beginning, I have prophesied and declared and set in order. Now
 let them,—the false gods,—tell us the future."
     God repeatedly calls attention to prophecy as incontestable proof
 of divinity. We may do the same. We need not fear. God stands by
 His predictions.
     5. What does God call the maker of graven images? Who makes
 these images? Verses 9-11.
      NOTE.—"Their delectable things." Another name for their idols
 which are "pets, favorites, treasures." They are their own witnesses.
 They witness against themselves, for they can neither see nor know.
 How, then, can they help othersl Verse 10 is a rhetorical question,
 "Who is so foolish as to make an imager
      "His fellows," that is, worshipers.
      The workmen are men. And how can men make a god'?
      6. How is the fashioning of an idol described? Verses 12-17.
      7. What have the makers of idols not known? What have they not
  considered? On what do they feed? What has turned them aside?
  Verses 18-20.
      Nom8.—"He hath shut their eyes." Rather, their eyes are plastered
  over.
      "None considereth." They do not think, they do not reflect. If
  they did, they would see the folly of their action.
      "Feedeth on ashes." (See Prov. 15: 14; Hosea 12: 1.)
      "A deceived heart." We need to ask God to help us not to deceive
  ourselves.
      "Can not deliver his soul." Help must come from some outside
  source. We can not save ourselves. An idol is a lie. Men believe an
  idol can help. But it is a vain hope.
      8. What are Jacob and Israel told to do? What has God blotted
  out? What invitation is given? Verses 21, 22.
      Nom8.—God tells His people to remember these things of which
  He has just been speaking. And if they do, God will remember them.
  They shall not be forgotten. God not merely promises to forgive, but
                                    [ 15]
 in this text it is spoken of as already done. "I have blotted out." It
 is as though a father were speaking to a wayward son or daughter
 who had caused the parents much sorrow and grief, "I have forgiven
 the past. All is well. Come home. Return to me. I have redeemed you."
     9. Why are heaven and earth called upon to break forth into sing-
 ing? Verse 23.
     NomE.—Rejoice, for the Lord hath done it 1 The Lord hath re-
 deemed' Jacob.
     10. How does the Lord again note His creative power? What other
 references does He make to His power? Verses 24-27.
     11. What is said of Cyrus? What should be done to Jerusalem?
 Verse 28.
     NOTE.—The mention of Cyrus by name, one hundred fifty years
 before his appearance, has been one of the chief factors in the decision
 of the critics that Isaiah did not write this part of his prophecies. It
 seems impossible to them that God could give a man's name even be-
 fore his birth. Such an attitude shows a great lack of faith, and, in-
 deed, most of the work of the critics is founded in unbelief. Josiah's
 name was announced three centuries before his birth. 1 Kings 13:2.
 And why should it be thought a thing incredible that God should do
 this? These very chapters in Isaiah emphasize again and again that
 God is different from idols. He can foretell the future. They can not.
 For anyone to hold the view that God can not tell what is to come, is
 to put Him on a level with idols.
     12. What is Cyrus here called? What had God done? What did
He say He would do for him? Isa. 45:1.
     NomE.—"His anointed." The only place in the Scriptures where
this is spoken of a Gentile.
     "The advent of the army of Cyrus before the walls of Babylon was
to the Jews a sign that their deliverance from captivity was drawing
nigh. More than a century before the birth of Cyrus, Inspiration had
mentioned him by name, and had caused a record to be made of the
actual work he should do in taking the city of Babylon unawares, and
in preparing the way for the release of the children of the captivity.
Through Isaiah the word had been spoken. . .
    "In the unexpected entry of the army of the Persian conqueror
into the heart of the Babylonian capital by way of the channel of the
river whose waters had been turned aside, and through the inner gates
that in careless security had been left open and unprotected, the Jews
had abundant evidence of the literal fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecy
concerning the sudden overthrow of their oppressors."—"Prophets and
Kings," pp. 551, 552.
    13. What would God do for Cyrus? Who would break in pieces the
gates of brass? Why would this be done? Verses 2, 3.
    NOTE.—God would go before and help Cyrus. He is the One who
would cause the gates to open. God would so work that Cyrus could
not fail to know that some supernatural power was helping him. Baby-
lon, according to Herodotus, had one hundred gates, all of brass. The
city could not be taken in any ordinary manner.
                                 [161
    14. For whose sake was Cyrus called by name? Verse 4.
    NOTE.—To establish the faith of His people, God called Cyrus by
name. When we see prophecy fulfilled, our faith should become
stronger. The fulfillment of prophecy in the signs of the times occur-
ring all about us should have the same effect.


                 LESSON 6—NOVEMBER 10, 1928

    THE VANITY' OF FALSE GODS; ONE ONLY
                  SAVIOUR
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Isaiah 45: 5-25; 46.
MEMORY VERSE: Isa. 45: 18.
                            INTRODUCTION
     The warnings against idolatry do not have reference only to the
 time of Isaiah. Anything that comes between us and our God is a
 false god, an idol. Whether it be worldly pleasure, the lusts of the
,flesh or of the eye, worldly wisdom, the follies and fashions of the
 hour, or position or honor, or the plaudits of the crowd,—all these
 are condemned as idolatry.
     But there are other dangers,—dangers threatening the church of
 God. Anything or anyone besides Christ which we trust to help us to
 obtain God's favor, becomes a vain hope, a false god. No works of our
  own can take the place of Christ. There is only one Saviour. Isa.
  45:21. He saves to the uttermost. Remember the admonition, "Keep
  yourselves from idols." 1 John 5: 21.
                              THE LESSON
     1. What does the Lord proclaim concerning Himself? What had
 He done for Cyrus? Isa. 45:5.
     NOTE.—"I girded thee." As God loosed the loins of the adver-
 saries (verse 1), to weaken them, so He "girded" those of Cyrus, to
 strengthen him.
     2. For what purpose was this done? Verse 6.
     3. What does God form? Create? Make? Verse 7.
     NOTE.—"Create evil." The "evil" here mentioned is not moral evil
 but physical, and could well be translated calamity. God punishes for
 sin, and it is these calamities to which the prophet refers. (See Amos
3:6.)
     4. What blessings are promised to God's people? Verse 8.
     NOTE.—These words indicate in figurative language the blessed
 consequences of opening the heart to God's righteousness. Reference
 is here made to the creative power of God manifested in the new life.
    5. What warning is given concerning murmuring against our
 Maker? Verses 9, 10.
    6. How does God here make known His creative power and fore-
 knowledge? Verses 11-14.
                              (17]
     NOTE.—God had raised up Cyrus, and would direct his ways. He
 was to conquer Egypt and Ethiopia, and they were to acknowledge
 God's dealings.
     7. What is God said to do? What will be the experience of idola-
 ters? What contrast is shown in the experience of Israel? Verses 15-17.
     NOTE.—God sometimes hides Himself. He "moves in a mysterious
 way, His wonders to perform." Rom. 11:33.
     "An everlasting salvation." Not saved to-day and lost to-morrow.
 Not a wonderful mountain-top experience one year at some great meet-
ing, and then an intermediate lapse into the valley.
     "World without end." Literally, to all eternity.
     8. For what purpose did God form the earth? Verse 18.
     9. How has God spoken to mankind? Verse 19.
     NOTE.—God may at times hide Himself, but He does not speak in
secret. Deut. 30:11-14. He does not ask men to seek Him in vain,
literally, in chaos, that is, without definite guidance and without hope
of result.
     10. Who are told to assemble themselves? What do those do who
have no knowledge of God? What questions are asked? What an-
swers are given? To whom are the ends of the earth to look? Verses
20-22.
     NOTE.—"Ye that are escaped of the nations." This call is to all
who "are escaped," that is, those whom God has called and who have
responded.
    "Tell ye." Announce, or, as in the American Revised Version, "de-
clare," His message of mercy to the nations.
    11. What has God sworn concerning the people of earth? Verse 23.
    NOTE.—Referring to events to take place at the close of the mil-
lennium, the following description is given: "Now Christ again ap-
pears to the view of His enemies. Far above the city, upon a founda-
tion of burnished gold, is a throne, high and lifted up. Upon this
throne sits the Son of God, and around Him are the subjects of His
kingdom. The power and majesty of Chriit no language can describe,
no pen portray."—"The Great Controversy," pp. 664, 665.
    "As if entranced, the wicked have looked upon the coronation of
the Son of God. They see in His hands the tables of the divine law,
the statutes which they have despised and transgressed. They witness
the outburst of wonder, rapture, and adoration from the saved; and
as the wave of melody sweeps over the multitudes without the city, all
with one voice exclaim, 'Great and marvelous are Thy works, Lord God
Almighty; just and true are Thy ways, Thou King of saints;' and
falling prostrate, they worship the Prince of life."—Id., pp. 668, 669.
    12. In whom do we have righteousness and strength? In whom are
we justified? Verses 24, 25.
    13. What is said of the downfall of the Babylonian gods? What
will happen to them? Isa. 46:1, 2.
    NOTE.—Bel and Nebo were Babylonian gods, answering to Jupiter
and Mercury. (See Acts 14:12.) Bel is the same as Baal, mentioned
elsewhere in the Bible.
                                   [ 15
    The picture here is of the Babylonians trying to save their gods.
They put them on beasts, and they make a load. "They could not de-
liver." Their gods can not save them. They themselves, the gods, are
"gone into captivity."
   14. How does God, by contrast, speak of Himself? Mat beautiful
promises are given to those who are growing old? Verses 3, 4.
   NorE.—The contrast here is striking. While the Babylonians must
carry their idols to save them, God carries and delivers. God will not
forsake. "Even to your old age I am He."
   15. How is an idol made? Verses 5-7.
    16. What does God counsel us to remember? Verses 8, 9.
    NOTE.—Remember this, and show yourselves men! In a time of
idolatry, when the whole current of life is downward, it takes courage
to stand against popular superstitions and customs. God calls for men.
    "The greatest want of the world is the want of men,—men who
will not be bought or sold; men who in their inmost souls are true and
honest; men who do not fear to call sin by its right name; men whose
conscience is as true to duty as the needle to the pole; men who will
stand for the right though the heavens fall."—"Education," p. 57.
    17. What does God declare from the beginning? What shall stand?
Verse 10.
    NOTE.—God again calls attention to the prophetic word, saying He
has declared "the end from the beginning." Even in the first chapter
of the Bible the heavenly bodies are mentioned as being signs.
    "My counsel shall stand." Isa. 14:24.
    "My pleasure," rather, My purpose.
   18. How is Cyrus spoken of? To whom does God appeal? What
will He bring near? What does He say of His salvation? Verses
11-13.
   Nova—Cyrus is here likened to a ravenous bird, as Nebuchadnez-
zar was likened to an eagle. Eze. 17:3. The royal Persian ensign was
an eagle.


                LESSON 7 — NOVEMBER 17, 1928

      THE FATE OF BABYLON; GOD'S FINAL
            APPEAL TO HIS PEOPLE
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Isaiah 47; 48.
MEMORY VERSE: Isa. 48: 18.
                            INTRODUCTION
    Babylon was given to pleasure, was tender and delicate. Vice and
folly sapped her strength. Gluttony, effeminacy, overrefinement, lux-
ury, pride, self-exaltation, were among her besetting sins. Babylon
said in her heart, "I am, and none else beside me." Pride was a domi-
nant trait. And pride goes before destruction.
                                 [19 1
     The sins that caused Babylon's fall are prevalent now, and will
 bring about the same results.
     In Isaiah 48, God makes another appeal to His creative power and
 to prophecy as the proof of His being the true God. In Isaiah's day
 it was the Creator against false gods, idols. To-day it is the same.
 False, evolutionary teachings are among the many theories by which
a scientific age would set aside the true God, the Creator of the heav-
 ens and the earth.
                                THE LESSON
     1. What message came to the ruler of Babylon? Dan. 4:31-; Isa.
47:1-5.
     NoTE.—"To the ruler of Babylon came the sentence of the divine
Watcher: 0 king, `to thee it is spoken: The kingdom is departed from
thee.'
" 'Come down, and sit in the dust, 0 virgin daughter of Babylon,
    Sit on the ground; there is no throne. . . .
    Sit thou silent,
    And get thee into darkness, 0 daughter of the Chaldeans;
    For thou shalt no more be called the lady of kingdoms.' "—"Educa-
tion," p. 176. This was fulfilled in the time of Belshazzar.
     "While still in the festal hall, surrounded by those whose doom had
been sealed, the king is informed by a messenger that 'his city is taken'
by the enemy against whose devices he had felt so secure; 'that the
passages are stopped, . . . and the men of war are affrighted.' Even
while he and his nobles were drinking from the sacred vessels of Je-
hovah, and praising their gods of silver and of gold, the Medea and
the Persians, having turned the Euphrates out of its channel, were
marching into the heart of the unguarded city. The army of Cyrus
now stood under the walls of the palace; the city was filled with the
soldiers of the enemy, 'as with caterpillars;' and their triumphant
shouts could be heard above the despairing cries of the astonished
revelers. 'In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans
slain,' and an alien monarch sat upon the throne."—"Prophets and
Kings," p. 531.
     2. Because of the sins of His people, what had God done to His
inheritance? How had Babylon treated the captives? Isa. 47:6.
     NOTE.—God's people had sinned, and He had been wroth. Isa. 64:
5, 9. The inheritance, the holy land, had been polluted, and Israel car-
ried into captivity. Babylon had shown Israel but little mercy, and the
ancient people, literally, aged people, had been compelled to work hard.
     3. What had Babylon said? To what was Babylon given? How
did she not expect to sit? What should come in one day? Verses 7-9;
Rev. 18:7, 8.
     NOTE.—"Given to pleasures." Babylon is not much different now.
"Dwellest carelessly." Belshazzar was dancing and drinking while
Death stalked without! Dancing the last night of probation! Danc-
ing on the brink of the abyss! Dancing while the Hand was about to
write Babylon's doom!
     4. What had Babylon further said? What had perverted her? What
had she said in her heart? Isaiah 47:10.
                                      [ 20 1
    NOTE.—"None seeth me." So think they that are now of Babylon.
    5. What would Babylon not be able to put off? How was desola-
tion to come? What challenge was given? Verses 11, 12.
    NOTE.—Punishment for sin is sure. It may be delayed, but it can
not be put off indefinitely. Destruction will come, and come suddenly.
Verse 12 is a challenge to the sorcerers and enchanters to come forth
with their enchantments, to see if they can avert the evil. The
prophet here taunts the sorcerers as Elijah did the prophets of Baal.
    6. What further challenge does the prophet issue? What does he
say of those who make false claims? What can they not do for them-
selves? Verses 13-15.
    NOTE.—"The astrologers and stargazers were men who pretended
to read the future from a study of the position of the stars. The
monthly prognosticators were such as prepared monthly almanacs in
which coming disasters were foretold, and lucky and unlucky days
pointed out."—Cambridge Bible.
    The destruction of Babylon by fire would not be a "fire to sit be-
fore," not one merely to warm one's self by, but an all-consuming de-
struction.
    7. Whom does God here address? What is said of their sincerity?
Of what city do they boast? In whom do they profess to take refuge?
Isa. 48:1, 2.
    8. What has God declared from the beginning? What does He say
of the fulfillment of His word? How does He speak of His people?
Why did God make known the events of the future? Verses 3-5.
    NOTE.—If G6d had not prophesied beforehand what should come
to pass, some would have given the credit to idols, saying that their
idols had done it or commanded it.
    9. What has God shown? Why had He not shown them before?
Verses 6-8.
    NoTE.—These verses might be paraphrased thus: "Thou hast heard
all this, and now thou seest it fulfilled. I will show thee from this time
new things, which thou hast not known before. They are entirely new,
and before to-day thou hast not heard them, lest thou shouldest say,
Behold, I knew them."
    10. For His own sake, what did God do? What had He done to
Israel? Whence did He choose them? For whose sake does He do
this? Verses 9-11.
    NoTE.—Instead of cutting off Israel, God purified them in the fur-
nace of affliction. He might leave Israel, but it would mean destruction.
The only alternative is the furnace. So it is with us. God has, good
reason for leaving us to our own way. But that would mean eternal loss.
Our only hope is God's purifying fire,—trials.
    11. In what terms does God again proclaim Himself the Creator?
How do heaven and earth obey Him? Verses 12, 13.
    12. What will God do to Babylon? Whom has He called? Verses
14-16.
                                   [ 21 ]
      NOTE.—God now again calls upon the nations to hear Him. Baby-
  lon shall fall. Verse 14. God has called him, that is Cyrus, and will pros-
  per him. Verse 15. Now, let every one hear this, for God is not speak-
  ing in secret. One hundred fifty years before Cyrus appears, God is
  saying this: Cyrus shall destroy Babylon. My word has always been
  fulfilled; and when you see this come to pass, when you see Babylon fall
  by a man whom I have named years before his birth, you may know that
  I am God.
      This is the last time Cyrus is mentioned in Isaiah. And with this
  chapter God closes the argument which He has so often used to prove
  His divinity, the facts of prophecy and creation.
      13. By what names is God called? What does God teach His peo-
  ple? How does He lead? Verse 17.
      14. What desire does God express? If the desire had been realized,
  what would result? Verses 18, 19.
      NorE.—"Those who take Christ at His word, and surrender their
  souls to His keeping, their lives to His ordering, will find peace and
  quietude. Nothing of the world can make them sad when Jesus makes
  them glad by His presence. In perfect acquiescence there is perfect
  rest."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 331.                                   •
      15. What call is given to God's people in Babylon? In what spirit
  will this call be given? How far will the message be sent? What will
  they say? Verse 20.
      NOTE.—This verse is prophetic of the last call to come out of
  Babylon. Rev. 18:4.
      "With a voice of singing." Clear, definite, musical. Not gloomy,
  but happy, for a way of escape has been found.
      This message will go to the end of the earth, and with it the
  blessed assurance that God has redeemed His people.
      16. How did God preserve His people when they fled from Egypt?
  Verse 21.
      NOTE.—This verse should be a source of comfort to God's people
  at this time. The way may be rough and thorny, but God will not
• leave His own. Psalm 91.
      17. What do the wicked lack? Verse 22.
      NOTE.—God "gives no one liberty to gloss over the sins of His
  people, nor to cry, 'Peace, peace!' when He has declared ,that there
  shall be no peace for the wicked. Those who stir up rebellion against
  the servants whom God sends to deliver His messages are rebelling
  against the word of the Lord."—"Testimonies," Vol. 4, p. 185.

                LESSON 8—NOVEMBER 24, 1928

THE SERVANT : HOPE FOR THE DISCOURAGED
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Isa. 49: 1-23.
MEMORY VERSE: Isa. 49: 15, 16.
                            INTRODUCTION
    With this chapter begins a new section of the book of Isaiah. The
term "the servant" is often mentioned. This refers to Christ, but in
some cases it has a double application and refers also to God's people.
However, there need be no confusion on this point, as the references
are clear.
                             THE LESSON
    1. In the beginning of this chapter, who are called upon to listen?
To what has God compared the mouth? What does God say of His
people? Isa. 49:1-3.
    NorE.—"Isles," literally, countries; "people," literally, peoples.
The whole world is called upon to hear the announcement, for it con-
cerns the whole world.
    "The Lord hath called Me." Luke 1:31-33.
    "Mention of My name." Matt. 1:21.
    "Sharp sword." Heb. 4:12.
    "A polished shaft," or arrow, even sharper than a sword.
    The description of "the servant" is that of Christ.
    "The Desire of Ages," pages 678, 679, quoting Isaiah 49:4, 5, 7-10,
applies the scripture to Christ. "Testimonies," Vol. 7, pages 191, 192,
quoting Isaiah 49:2-6, applies it to the people of God. Hence we accept
these references as having a double application, first to Christ, then
to Israel, old and new.
    2. What brought discouragement to "the Servant"? In what words
did He leave the matter with God? Verse 4.
    NOTE.—"As the world's Redeemer, Christ was constantly con-
fronted with apparent failure. He, the messenger of mercy to our
world, seemed to do little of the work He longed to do in uplifting and
saving. Satanic influences were constantly working to oppose His
 way. But He would not be discouraged. Through the prophecy of
 Isaiah He declares, have labored in vain, I have spent My strength
 for naught, and in vain: yet surely My judgment is with the Lord,
 and My work with My God.' "—"The Desire of Ages," p. 678.
    If Christ could feel a sense of discouragement, is it surprising that
 we sometimes feel the same ways Let us follow His example: leave
 ourselves with the Lord, and take courage.
     The American Revised Version translates the latter part of the
 verse: "Yet surely the justice due to Me is with Jehovah, and My
 recompense with My God."
     3. For what purpose was "the Servant" called? How was He re-
 garded by the Lord? Verse 5.
     NoTE.—This verse seems to have definite reference to Christ. He
 was called to bring "Jacob" back to God, and also, as the American
 Revised Version has it, "that Israel be gathered unto Him."
                                   [ 23 ]
      Christ was glorious, or honorable, in the sight of God. Yet He did
 not take glory to Himself. He said, "I can of Mine own self do noth-
 ing." John 5: 30.
      4. What does God say is a light thing? To whom did God say He
 would also make the Servant a fight? For what purpose? Verse 6.
      NOTE.—"This prophecy was generally understood as spoken of the
 Messiah, and when Jesus said, am the light of the world,' the people
 could not fail to recognize His claim to be the Promised One."—"The
  Desire of Ages," p. 465.
      "Prophets and Kings," pages 688, 689, says that it was generally
  understood that the coming of the Messiah was referred to in the
  prophecy of Isaiah 49:6.
      This prophecy, however, also has an application to the people of
  God. After quoting Isaiah 49:6, "Testimonies," Vol. 7, page 192, says:
      "This is the word of the Lord to all who are in any way connected
  with His appointed institutions. They are favored of God, for they
  are brought into channels where the light shines. They are in His
  special service, and they should not esteem this a light thing."
      A paraphrase of Isaiah 49:6 would read: "It is too small a work
  for you to labor only among those who already know the truth. I will
  send you for a light to the heathen, that you may bring salvation to
  the ends of the earth."
      This is an excellent foreign-missionary text. God's ministers are
  not constantly to hover over the churches. The call is to send the mes-
  sage to the ends of the earth. Nor must the people demand that their
  tithes and offerings be spent in ministering to themselves, thus con-
  suming their own gifts.
      5. How is Christ spoken of? What prophecy is made concerning
  Him? Verse 7.
      NOTE.—This verse refers definitely to Christ. "It is to Christ that
  the promise is given," says "The Desire of Ages," page 678, quoting
  Isaiah 49:7-10. He was despised of men. Isa. 53:3. It is not the
  Jews only who cry, "Away with Him." John 19:15. "A servant of
  rulers," taunted and scourged by such rulers as Herod and Pontius
. Pilate. Luke 23:11; John 19:1, 16. Nevertheless the time will come
  when kings and rulers shall "see and arise." Wonderful change!
      6. When did God hear? When did He help? For what would God
  give Christ to the people? What should be done to the earth? Verse 8.
      NOTE.—Christ is here again spoken of as the covenant. (Compare
  chapter 42:6.) He has become the mediator of a new covenant (Heb.
  8:6), and hence may be spoken of in the terms of our text.
      "Establish the earth," rather, raise up the earth, that is, lift it out
  of its present degraded, sin-cursed condition. Christ came to seek and
  to save that which is lost, and this includes the earth.
      7. What shall be said to the prisoners? What to those in darkness?
  What shall these liberated prisoners do? Verse 9.
      NoTE.—Compare Isaiah 61:1. Moffatt translates the latter part of
  the verse thus: "On the road home food shall never fail them, they
  shall find pasture even upon bare hills."
                                    [24]
   8. What experience shall they not have? How are they protected
from these? Verse 10; Ps. 121:6.
    9. How shall the way be prepared? Whence do these prisoners'
 come? Isa. 49:11, 12.
•  NOTE.—By many commentators Sinim is thought to refer to China.
   10. Why are the heavens and the earth to rejoice? But what does
Zion, or God's people, say? Verses 13, 14.
    11. What illustration is used to show forth God's remembrance
of His people? What assurance is given? Where are we graven? Who
shall be separated from God's people? Verses 15-17.
    NOTE.—"Not a single soul who puts his trust in Him will be for-
gotten. God thinks of His children with the tenderest solicitude, and
keeps a book of remembrance before Him, that He may never forget
the children, of His care."—"Testimonies," Vol. 4. pp. 329, 330.
    Verse 17 contains an interesting statement. "Thy destroyers and
they that made thee waste shall go forth of thee." While God's people
are to go out of Babylon, when it comes to the church, it is not the
church that leaves and goes out, but the destroyers, the wasters. It
is not those that "go forth" that constitute the church. The church
remains.
   12. After the wasters and destroyers have gone forth from the
church, who shall come to take their place? What solemn statement
does the Lord make? Verse 18.
   13. What shall be too narrow? What shall these new children say?
Verses 19, 20.
   14. What questions shall Zion ask? What answer does the Lord
give? What is said of kings and queens? Who shall not be ashamed?
Verses 21-23.
   NOTE.—These latter verses without doubt found their first fulfill-
ment in the coming in of the Gentiles in the Christian era. May we
not believe they will find another and even more complete fulfillment,
and that they that wait for the Lord shall not be ashamed?


                 LESSON 9—DECEMBER 1, 1928

      "THY SAVIOUR AND THY REDEEMER"
 LESSON SCRIPTURE: Isa. 49: 24-26; 50.
 MEMORY VERSE: Isa. 50: 10.
                          INTRODUCTION
    To Isaiah had been revealed a comprehensive view of the plan of
salvation. He understood that man was Satan's captive, and also that
there is One mightier than the mighty who could take away the prey,
and that this One was the Lord, "thy Saviour and thy Redeemer."
    To the Jew, the word Redeemer was most expressive and meaning-
ful. Sometimes a poor man might sell himself. If so, he could be
                                [25 1
redeemed, but only by one near of kin. Lev. 25:47-49. The redemp-
tion was effected by the kinsman's paying the just demand in full.
Lev. 25:27; 1 Peter 1:18, 19. The story of Ruth is a beautiful illus-
tration of redemption.
    This lesson also brings to view the suffering Saviour. What a
wonderful picture is given of His passion! He feels the insults to the
quick, but does not draw back. His face is set like a flint; that is, He
is determined to go through to the end. The Lord will help Him. They
will "stand together." Christ passed through darkness. Let others
who may be doing God's will, yet are confronted with difficulties and
perplexities, take courage. God is still living.
                            THE LESSON
    1. What question is asked concerning the mighty, and the lawful
captive? Isa. 49:24.
    2. What answer does the Lord give? What does the Lord promise
to do? Verse 25.
    NOTE.—"The mighty" here spoken of, is Satan. He has some
captives, some who have given themselves over to evil, and are justly
his captives.
    "All who willfully depart from God's commandments are placing
themselves under the control of Satan. Many a man tampers with
evil, thinking that he can break away at pleasure; but he is lured on
and on, until he finds himself controlled by a will stronger than his
     "Yet his condition is not hopeless. God does not control our minds
without our consent; but every man is free to choose what power he
will have to rule over him."—"Ministry of Healing," pp. 92, 93.
     3. What terrible punishment will be meted out to the oppressors?
What shall all men know? Verse 26.
     4. What two questions does the Lord ask? Who had sold them?
Why were they put away? Isa. 50:1.
     NOTE.—When Isaiah wrote this, God had not as yet put away His
people, Israel. They deserved this treatment, but God was still merci-
ful. Later on He did divorce Israel. Jer. 3: 8.
     In Isaiah 50:1 God asks for proof that He has put Israel away.
The answer, of course, is that He has not put them away, nor sold
them to the creditors as was sometimes the custom. Neh. 5:5; 2 Kings
4:1. They had, however, sold themselves. Isa. 52:3.
     5. What questions does God now ask? Verses 2, 3.
     NOTE.—If I have not put you away, but have called you, how is
it that no one responds? Is it because you think My band is shortened
so I can not redeem, or that I have no power? God is astonished and
perplexed that no one answers His call. He offers the riches of heaven,
and men are not interested.
     6. What has God given His servant? For what purpose? What
does God do every morning? Verse 4.
     NOTE.—" 'The Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to
minister.' Not for Himself, but for others, He lived and thought and
                                   26
prayed. From hours spent with•God He came forth morning by morn-
ing, to bring the light of heaven to men. Daily He received a fresh
baptism of the Holy Spirit. In the early hours of the new day the
Lord awakened Him from His slumbers, and His soul and His lips
were anointed with grace, that He might impart to others. His words
were given Him fresh from the heavenly courts, words that He might
speak in season to the weary and oppressed."—"Christ's Object Les-
sons," p. 139.
   "Words of kindness are as welcome as the smile of angels."—
"Ministry of Healing," p. 158.
    7. How did Christ show His willing submission to God? Verse 5.
    NOTE.—The ears of the true servant are always open, and those
of the rebellious servant are closed. The true servant will hear the
word and do it. The wicked servant will not hear. Matt. 7:24-29.
    8. To whom did Christ submit His back? His cheeks? From what
did He not hide His face? Verse 6.
    9. When were these prophecies fulfilled? Matt. 27:26-31; Mark
15:19.
    10. What confidence did Christ express in God? How did Christ
set His face? What did He know? Isa. 50:7.
    NOTE.—"Difficulties will arise that will try your faith and patience.
Face them bravely. Look on the bright side. . . . Never let your
courage fail. Never talk unbelief because appearances are against
you. As you work for the Master, you will feel pressure for want of
means, but the Lord will hear and answer your petitions for help. Let
your language be, 'The Lord God will help me; therefore shall I not
be confounded: therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know
that I shall not be ashamed.' Isa. 50:7.
    "If you make a mistake, turn your defeat into victory. The les-
sons that God sends will always, if well learned, bring help in due
time. Put your trust in God: Pray much, and believe. Trusting, hop-
ing, believing, holding fast the hand of Infinite Power, you will be
more than conquerors."—"Testimonies," Vol. 7, p. 244.
    11. Who is said to be near? What other question is asked? What
challenge is made? Verse 8.
    NomE.—Christ was mocked and condemned by the Jewish Sanhe-
drin and by Rome. But He knew that though He was condemned by
man, God would justify Him.
    "Let us stand together." With God on his side, who need be afraid?
The challenge is issued: "Who is mine adversary? let him come near to
me." God is on our side, and victory is sure.
    12. Who will ever be our help? What shall happen to the opposers?
Verse 9. (Compare with Rom. 8:33, 34.)
    13. What questions are asked? In whom are we counseled to trust?
Verse 10.
    NOTE.—There are those that fear the Lord and obey the voice of
His servant, and yet walk in darkness, literally in dark places, that
                                   27
is, in trouble. Many are doing the best they know, and live up to all
the light they have, and still are not free from trouble. What shall
they do' "Let him trust in the name of the Lord, and stay upon his
God."
    14. What is said to those that compass themselves about with
sparks of their own kindling? What shall be their end? Verse 11.
    NOTE.—The picture is that of a man in darkness, trying to get
light by kindling a fire. All that results, however, is a few sparks.
Refusing God's light, he tries to make one of his own. But he shall
mot succeed.
   "Many look to their ministers to bring the light from God to
them, seeming to think this a cheaper way than to be at the trouble
of going to God for it themselves. Such lose much. If they would
daily follow Christ, and make Him their guide and counselor, they
might obtain a clear knowledge of His will, and thus be gaining a
valuable experience. For want of this very experience, brethren pro-
fessing the truth walk in the sparks of others' kindling; they are un-
acquainted with the Spirit of God and have not a knowledge of His
will, and are therefore easily moved from their faith. They are un-
stable, because they trusted in others to obtain an experience for
them. Ample provisions have been made for every son and daughter
of Adam to obtain individually a knowledge of the divine will, to
perfect Christian character, and to be purified through the truth.
God is dishonored by that class who profess to be followers of Christ,
and yet have no experimental knowledge of the divine will or of the
mystery of godliness."—"Testimonies," Vol. 2, p. 644.


                  LESSON 10 — DECEMBER 8, 1928

 THE RIGHTEOUSNESS AND POWER OF GOD;
        HIS CARE FOR HIS PEOPLE
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Isa. 51: 1-16.
MEMORY VERSE: Isa. 51: 3.

                            INTRODUCTION
    It is well sometimes to look back. It helps us not to despise the
 day of small things. We need to look back to the days of the be-
 ginnings of this message, when hardship, toil, and privation were the
portion of minister and of people. We are living in an age of ex-
travagance and luxury, and there is danger that we partake of the
oparit of the times. What we are, we are by the grace of God. Let us
Ikeep to the simplicity of the gospel.
    The contrast between mortal man and his Maker is clearly brought
out in this lesson. Man is like a garment which the moths eat, like a
gnat that dies, like wool which the worms eat, like grass which is burned.
'There is very little place in those terms for the doctrine of natural im-
 mortality. On the other hand, God's salvation is everlasting, and His
righteousness, that is, His character, His law, shall not be abolished.
                                   1281
                              THE LESSON
    1. Who are asked to hearken unto the Lord? Where are they asked
to look? Isa. 51: 1.
    NOTE.—"Righteousness here means, not salvation, but righteousness
in conduct, a way of life in accordance with the will of God."—Cam-
bridge Bible.
    It is well, sometimes, to look back on our own personal history
and consider where we would be, and what we would be, had not God
found us. Looking back on these things would probably make us more
humble and more thankful.
    2. To whom are we to look? How was Abraham called? Verse 2.
    NoTE.—"Called him alone," literally "as one," before he had chil-
dren.
    "Blessed him." Gen. 24:1.
    "Increased him," made him father of many nations. Gen. 17:5.
    3. What will the Lord do to Zion and to the waste places? What
will He make of the wilderness and of the desert? What shall be
found there? Verse 3.
    NOTE.—This refers definitely to the new earth state.
    "Like Eden," like the garden of the Lord.
    "There we shall know even as also we are known. There the loves
and sympathies that God has planted in the soul will find truest and
sweetest exercise." Read "Education," pp. 306, 307.
    4. What will proceed from the Lord? What will God make to rest
for a light? Verse 4.
    NOTE.—"I will make My judgment to rest." A somewhat unusual
construction. Judgment is the same word as in Isaiah 42:1, and might
be rendered religion, as the Cambridge Bible has it. God, then, will
send the true religion to all peoples, and it will be to them for a light.
    5. What is near? What has gone forth? How will the people be
judged? On whom do the isles wait? On what do they trust?
Verse 5.
    NOTE.—This verse may rightly, as does the preceding one, have
reference to the last days. God's righteousness and salvation are near.
He is about to judge the people. The same arm that brings destruc-
tion to sinners will bring salvation to the saints.
    6. What change will take place in the heavens? What changes will
come to the earth? To the inhabitants? What will remain forever?
What will not be abolished? Verse 6.
    NOTE.—This verse brings to view the contrast between the things
that shall perish and the things that shall remain. The world has this
reversed. That which God says shall vanish, men say will stand for-
ever. That which God says shall not be abolished, men professedly be-
lieve to be abolished.
    7. Who are now directly addressed? Of what are they not to fear
or be afraid? Verse 7.
    NOTE.—Apparently those who have God's law in their heart will be
 reviled and reproached.
                                    291
    "Through Satan's temptations the whole human race have become
transgressors of God's law; but by the sacrifice of His Son a way
is opened whereby they may return to God. Through the grace of
Christ they may be enabled to render obedience to the Father's law.
Thus in every age, from the midst of apostasy and rebellion, God
gathers out a people that are true to Him—a people 'in whose heart
is His law.' "—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 338.
    8. What contrast is made between men and God's righteousness
and salvation? Verse 8.
    9. What is the Lord exhorted to do? What question is asked of
God? Verse 9.
    NOTE.—Rahab, literally, the proud one, is symbolically an expres-
sion for Egypt. Ps. 89:10, margin. The dragon is another symbol
for Egypt. Eze. 29:3. The reference here is to the destruction of
Pharaoh's army at the Red Sea. The dragon originally is Satan. Rev.
12:7-9. This term is therefore applied also to the adversaries of God
generally.
   10. What reference is made to Israel's experience at the Red Sea?
Verse 10.
   NOTE.—The reference here is clear to the drvipg up of the Red
Sea, that the Israelites might pass over. Ex. 14 I! 22.
    11. To what is the prophet's mind now turned? Verse 11.
    NOTE.—This verse is nearly identical with Isaiah 35:10, and fur-
ishes a good illustration of how an event of the past, as Israel's de-
liverance from Egypt, will suggest the greater deliverance that shall
soon come to God's people.
   12. Of whom should we not be afraid? Whom should we not for-
get? What question is asked? Verses 12, 13.
   13. What will-God do for the captive exile? Verse 14.
   NOTE.—The American Revised Version is a little clearer: "The
captive exile shall speedily be loosed; and he shall not die and go
down into the pit, neither shall his bread fail."
   14. How does God speak of His power? What is His name?
Verse 15.
   NOTE.—Reference is again made to the crossing of the Red Sea.
   15. What has God done for His people? What does He say to
Zion? Verse 16.
   NOTE.—The Septuagint renders this verse: "I will put My words
into thy mouth, and I will shelter thee under the shadow of Mine
hand, with which I fixed the sky, and founded the earth; and the
Lord shall say to Zion; Thou art My people."

   "The knowledge of God that works transformation of character is
our great need. If we fulfill His purpose, there must be in our lives a
revelation of God that shall correspond to the teaching of His word."—
"Testimonies," Vol. 8, p. 329.

                LESSON 11—DECEMBER 15, 1928

       ZION LED FROM UTTER DEFEAT TO
            TRIUMPHANT VICTORY
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Isa. 51: 17-23;52: 1-12.
MEMORY VERSE: Isa. 52: 7.
                          INTRODUCTION
   The first picture presented to us in the lesson is that of Jerusalem
figured as a woman lying drunk and senseless, unable to help herself.
She has drunk to the very dregs the cup of the Lord's indignation,
and no one can help her.
    The second picture is much more encouraging. Zion is asked to
awake, put on her strength and her beautiful garments. God will
cleanse and beautify His church, and henceforth no unclean thing
shall enter.
    The third picture is that of the gospel proclamation to the whole
world. God's people are united. They sing together. They are one.
And God is baring His holy arm. for them. They have left Babylon;
they are "clean." God goes before them, and victory is assured.
                            THE LESSON
    1. Who is told to awake? What experience has Jerusalem gone
through? Isa. 51:17.
    NOTE.—The prophet here by anticipation speaks of .he destruction
of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, and the resulting calamities. 2
Kings 25:8-11; compare Jer. 42:18.
    2. Who is there to help her? What two things have come upon
her? 'What is said of her sons? Verses 18-20.
    NOTE.—"None to guide." When Jerusalem was destroyed and most
of the people taken into captivity, the leaders were also taken. Not
a few people remained in the land, but there were no leaders. When
Jeremiah and Baruch were taken to Egypt, there was none left. Jer.
43:5-7.
    "These two things." "Desolation," or wasting produced by the
"famine" within the city; and "destruction," produced by the "sword"
without the city.
    3. Whom does God now address? How does God speak of Himself?
 What will God do to the cup? What have the nations done to the
people of God? Verses 21-23.
    NoTE.—"Thy God that pleadeth the cause of His people." This
 can be none other than Christ.
    "I have taken out of thine hand the cup." God will take the cup
 away from Jerusalem, and give it to the nations that afflicted her.
 These have trampled upon His people, and now retribution comes.
    4. To whom does the call come to awake? Who shall henceforth
 no more come into the holy city? Isa. 52:1.
    NOTE.—The church is here bidden to put on her strength and the
 beautiful garments of Christ's righteousness. "Souls are perishing
                                 [ 31 ]
 out of Christ, and those who profess to be Christ's disciples are letting
 them die. Our brethren have talents intrusted to them for the very
 work of saving souls; but some have bound these up in a napkin, and
 buried them in the earth. How much do such idlers resemble the angel
who is represented as flying in the midst of heaven, proclaiming the
commandments of God and the faith of Jesus/ What manner of en-
treaty can be brought to bear upon the idlers that will arouse them
 to go to work for the Master? What can we say to the slothful
church member to make him realize the necessity of unearthing his
 talent and putting it out to the exchangers? There will be no idler,
no slothful one, found inside the kingdom of heaven. 0 that God
would set this matter in all its importance before the sleeping churches!
O that Zion would arise and put on her beautiful garments. 0 that
she would shine!"—"Testimonies," Vol. 6, p. 434.
     5. What are Jerusalem and the captive daughter of Zion told to
do? Verse 2.
     NOTE.—"Shake thyself from the dust." Get rid of all sin.
    "Loose thyself from the bands of thy neck," literally, the bands of
thy neck are unloosened; that is, I have caused thy chains to fall
from thee.
     6. For what had they sold themselves? How shall they be re-
deemed? Verse 3.
    NOTE.—"The enemy is buying souls to-day very cheap. 'Ye have
sold yourselves for a thing of naught,' is the language of Scripture.
One is selling his soul for the world's applause, another for money;
one to gratify base passions, another for worldly amusements. Such
bargains are made daily. Satan is bidding for the purchase of Christ's
blood, and buying them cheap, notwithstanding the infinite price which
has been paid to ransom them."—"Testimonies," Vol. 5, p. 133.
     7. Where did the people aforetime go? How did the Assyrians
treat them. Verse 4.
     NOTE.—Israel experienced three captivities. The first when they
"went down" into Egypt and were made to serve. Ex. 1:13, 14.
    The second was the Assyrian captivity. 2 Kings 15: 29; 17:6;
18:13.
     The third is the Babylonian captivity, referred to in Isaiah 52:5.
    8. What question does the Lord ask? How did Babylon treat the
captives? What is said of the name of the Lord? What shall they
know? Verses 5, 6.
    NOTE.—"To the prophet [Isaiah] was given a revelation of the
beneficent design of God in scattering impenitent Judah among the
nations of earth. 'My people shall know My name,' the Lord declared;
'they shall know in that day that I am He that doth speak.' And not
only were they themselves to learn the lesson of obedience and trust;
in their places of exile they were also to impart to others a knowledge
of the living God. Many from among the sons of the strangers were
to learn to love Him as their Creator and their Redeemer; they were
to begin the observance of His holy Sabbath day as a memorial of
His creative power; and when He should make 'bare His holy arm in .
                                    32
the eyes of all the nations,' to deliver His people from captivity, 'all
the ends of the earth' should see of the salvation of God. Many of
these converts from heathenism would wish to unite themselves fully
with the Israelites, and accompany them on the return journey to
Judea."—"Prophets and Kings," pp. 371, 372.
    9. What is said of him that bringeth good tidings? What is said
to Zion? Verse 7.
    NOTE.—The good tidings referred first to the news to Israel in
Babylon that they were free to leave the land of their captivity and
return to the land of Judea. It is also the gospel proclamation: good
tidings, peace, good tidings of good, salvation.
    "Thy God reigneth!" God is still ruling in the affairs of men. It
may seem that things are going to pieces, that evil is triumphant and
the right is perverted. But be of good cheer. "Thy God reigneth!"
    10. What do the watchmen do? How do they sing? How do they
see? When? Verse 8.
    NOTE.—"Never was there so great a diversity of faith in Christen-
dom as at the present day. If the gifts [Eph. 4:11-13] were necessary
to preserve the unity of the primitive church, how much more so to re-
store unity now And that it is the purpose of God to restore the unity
of the church in the last days, is abundantly evident from the prophe-
cies. We are assured that the watchmen shall see eye to eye, when the
Lord shall bring again Zion. Also, that in the time of the end the
wise shall understand. When this is fulfilled there will be unity of
faith with all whom God accounts wise; for those that do in reality
understand aright, must necessarily understand alike. What is to ef-
fect this unity but the gifts that are given for this very purpose II"—
"Early Writings," p. 140.
    11. How may the joy of God's people be fitly expressed? What
has the Lord done? Verse 9.
     12. What has•the Lord done in the sight of the nations? What
shall the ends of the earth see? Verse 10.
     13. What are His people told not to touch? Who must be clean?
Verse 11.
     NOTE.—God's ministers must be holy, clean. So must His people.
This scripture applies to ministers and people.
     "The church will rarely take a higher stand than is taken by her
ministers. We need a converted ministry and a converted people.
 Shepherds who watch for souls as they that must give account will
lead the flock on in paths of peace and holiness. Their success in this
work will be in proportion to their own growth in grace and knowledge
 of the truth. When the teachers are sanctified, soul, body, and spirit,
 they can impress upon the people the importance of such sanctifica-
 tion."—"Testimonies," Vol. 5, p. 227.
     14. How should God's people not go out? Why is haste and se-
 crecy unnecessary? Verse 12.
     NOTE.—"Not go out with haste." This refers first to the departure
 from Babylonian captivity, as described in Ezra; but the scripture
                                  [331
also has a wider application. God wants His people to be ready, and
to do deliberately and with forethought that 'which needs to be done.
God is not in a hurry, and He will go before us. He will also be our
rearward. The final triumph of His people at Christ's coming shall
likewise be a complete victory in full sight of the nations.


                LESSON 12 — DECEMBER 22, 1928

                     THE LAMB OF GOD
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Isa. 52: 13-15; 53: 1-5.
MEMORY VERSE: Isa. 53: 5.
                            INTRODUCTION
    "It would be well to spend a thoughtful hour each day reviewing
the life of Christ from the manger to Calvary. We should take it
point by point, and let the imagination vividly grasp each scene, es-
pecially the closing ones of His earthly life. By thus contemplating
His teachings and sufferings, and the infinite sacrifice made by Him
for the redemption of the race, we may strengthen our faith, quicken
our love, and become more deeply imbued with the spirit which sus-
tained our Saviour."—"Testimonies," Vol. 4, p: 374.
    The wrong views which the Jews held in regard to sin and suffer-
ing helped decidedly to cause them to reject Christ. If any man suf-
fered, it was clear to them that he must be a great sinner. God knew
this, and in the fifty-third chapter of Isaiah corrects the idea. Christ
was indeed smitten of God, but it was for our sake; He was scourged,
but it was that we might be healed.
    Help on this lesson may be found in "Testimonies," Vol. 2, pages
200-215.
                              THE LESSON
    1. What will God's Servant do? Because of this, what will be His
position? Isa. 52:13.
    NOTE.—"My Servant shall deal wisely."—American Revised Ver-
sion. The word here used primarily means wisely, but it also includes
the success which is normally the result of wise action; hence the mar-
gin has "prosper."
    Christ did deal wisely in all acts of life. Wisely He chose His
disciples not from the rich or learned, lest it be said that influence or
learning was the cause of His remarkable success. Wisely He re-
fused to be made king, lest ambition be laid to His charge. Wisely He
hid His divinity and did most of His miracles unnoticed, so that the
supernatural should not have undue influence in deciding men. Wisely
He submitted Himself to civil authority. Wisely He answered subtle
questions and avoided others. Wisely He dealt with the erring and
downtrodden. No unwise word or action has ever been laid to His
charge,—not even by His enemies.
    "Shall be exalted." Christ was highly exalted. Phil. 2:9-11.
    2. Why were many astonished? Verse 14.
                                  [ 34 ]
    NOTE.—The word "astonied" expresses the thought of blank amaze-
ment, mingled with horror, aroused in those who should behold the
Saviour's extreme anguish and suffering.
   "He bore insult, mockery, and shameful abuse, until His 'visage
was so marred more than any man, and His form more than the sons
of men.'
    "Who can comprehend the love here displayed! The angelic host
beheld with wonder and with grief. Him who had been the Majesty
of heaven, and who bad worn the crown of glory, now wearing the
crown of thorns, a bleeding victim to the rage of an infuriated mob,
fired to insane madness by the wrath of Satan. Behold the patient
Sufferer! Upon His head is the thorny crown. His lifeblood flows
from every lacerated vein. All this in consequence of sin! Nothing
could have induced Christ to leave His honor and majesty in heaven,
and come to a sinful world, to be neglected, despised, and rejected,
by those He came to save, and finally to suffer upon the cross, but
eternal, redeeming love, which will ever remain a mystery."—"Tes-
timonies," Vol. 2, p. 207.
   3. What will He do to many nations? What will kings do? Why?
Verse 15.
    NOTE.—This verse speaks of the results of Christ's humiliation.
   "So shall He sprinkle many nations," rather, "startle." The Ameri-
can Revised Version, putting verses 14 and 15 together, reads, "Like
as many were astonished at Thee (His visage was so marred more
than any man, and His form more than the sons of men), so shall He
startle [astonish] many nations." (See margin.) It should be an
astonishing thing that from such an act, the suffering and death of
an innocent person, should come such wonderful results.
    "Kings shall shut their mouths at Him," in reverence, as princes
did in the case of Job before calamity came upon him. Job 29:8, 9.
   4. What two questions are now asked? Isa. 53:1.
   5. How should Christ grow up? What is said of His appearance?
Verse 2.
   NOTE.—In the Old Testament it was required that the sacrifice
should be perfect, without blemish. Lev. 1:3; 6:6. Concerning Christ's
personal appearance, read "Early Writings," page 172.
   It was in the spiritual rather than in the physical sense that the
Jews rejected Christ. If He had come as a prince and received honor
of men; if He had used His miraculous power to free them from the
Roman yoke; if He would even continue to feed them as He had done
with the five thousand, they might have accepted Him.
   "For more than a thousand years the Jewish people had waited
the coming of the promised Saviour. Their brightest hopes had rested
upon this event. For a thousand years, in song and prophecy, in tem-
ple rite and household prayer, His name had been enshrined; and
yet when He came, they did not recognize Him as the Messiah for
whom they had so long waited. 'He came unto His own, and His own
received Him not.' To their world-loving hearts, the Beloved of
heaven was 'as a root out of a dry ground.' In their eyes He had 'no
                                 E 35 ]
form nor comeliness;' they discerned in Him no beauty that they
should desire Him."—"Prophets and Kings," p. 710.
   6. How did men treat Christ? What is He called? With what is
He acquainted? How did they treat Him? What did they not do?
Verse 3.
   NOTE.—"Mark the humble life of the Son of God. . . . Behold His
ignominy, His agony in Gethsemane, and learn what self-denial is.
Are we suffering want? so was Christ, the Majesty of heaven. But
His poverty was for our sakes. Are we ranked among the rich? so
was He. But He consented for our sakes to become poor, that we
through His poverty might be made rich. In Christ we have self-
denial exemplified. His sacrifice consisted not merely in leaving the
royal courts of heaven, in being tried by wicked men as a criminal and
pronounced guilty, and in being delivered up to die as a malefactor,
but in bearing the weight of the sins of the world. The life of Christ
rebukes our indifference and coldness."—"Testimonies," Vol. 3, p. 407.
    7. What has Christ borne and carried? Verse 4, first part; Matt.
8:16, 17.
    NOTE.—"The Majesty of heaven pleased not Himself. Whatever
He did was in reference to the salvation of man. Selfishness in all its
forms stood rebuked in His presence. He assumed our nature that He
might suffer in our stead, making His soul an offering for sin. He
was stricken of God and afflicted to save man from the blow which he
deserved because of the transgression of God's law. By the light
shining from the cross, Christ proposed to draw all men unto Him.
His human heart yearned over the race. His arms were opened to re-
ceive them, and He invited all to come to Him. His life on earth
was one continued act of self-denial and condescension."—"Testimon-
ies," Vol. 4, p. 418.
    8. How did we esteem Him? Isa. 53:4, last part.
    NOTE.—It was generally believed by the Jews that sin is punished
in this life. Every affliction was regarded as the penalty of some
wrongdoing, either of the sufferer himself or of his parents. It is true
that all suffering results from the transgression of God's law, but this
truth had become perverted. Satan, the author of sin and all its re-
sults, had led men to look upon disease and death as proceeding from
God,—as punishment arbitrarily inflicted on account of sin. Hence,
one upon whom some great affliction or calamity had fallen had the
additional burden of being regarded as a great sinner.
    "Thus the way was prepared for the Jews to reject Jesus. He who
'hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows,' was looked upon by
the Jews as 'stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted;' and they hid their
faces from Him."—"The Desire of Ages," pp. 470, 471.
   9. Why was Christ wounded? And bruised? What was upon Him?
How are we healed? Verse 5.
   NOTE.—"Christ was treated as we deserve, that we might be treated
as He deserves. He was condemned for our sins, in which He had no
share, that we might be justified by His righteousness, in which we
had no share. He suffered the death which was ours, that we might
                                 [ 36 ]
receive the life which was His. 'With His stripes we are healed' "—
"The Desire of Ages," p. 25.
    10. What is sometimes the cause of affliction? John 9:1-3; 11:4.
    NOTE.—While sickness is often a result of sin, all sickness is not
directly caused by sin. We do not suppose that Christ meant to say
that the blind man or his parents had never sinned, but that this afflic-
tion had not come to them because of any specific evil they had done.
Christ was trying to counteract the idea of the Jews who believed that
when people are afflicted, they must be great sinners.
    According to these texts, some are sick that "the works of God
should be made manifest;" others are sick "for the glory of God."
Paul's "thorn in the flesh" may be an illustration of the latter kind.
    If, when we are sick, we have searched our hearts for any hidden
and unconfessed sin, and have found none, we need not continually
distress ourselves over the outcome. God knows best. It may be "that
the works of God should be made manifest" in healing; for God will
do great things for us if He is asked.
    11. Why does affliction sometimes come to God's children? 2 Cor.
1:3-7.
    NOTE.—God comforts us in our tribulation, with the intent "that
we may be able to comfort" others. According to this, some are af-
flicted for the "consolation and salvation" of others. Verse 6. This
should be a great comfort to many who wonder why God sends cer-
tain afflictions to them. Remember, dear one, there may be some poor
struggling soul going through deep waters whom God is preparing you
to help by causing you to go through afflictions that will make you
more understanding and sympathetic. So do not despair. God is giv-
 ing you certain experiences that will make you a better worker, a
better Christian.


                 LESSON 13—DECEMBER 29, 1928

          STRICKEN BECAUSE OF ISRAEL'S
                TRANSGRESSIONS
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Isa. 53: 6-12.
MEMORY VERSE: Isa. 53: 11.
                           INTRODUCTION
    The suffering, death, and resurrection of Christ must ever be vital
in the life and message of every Christian: The subject of the atone-
ment can never grow old. Righteousness by faith rightly understood
and practiced is needed more than ever.
    "The proud heart strives to earn salvation; but both our title to
heaven and our fitness for it are found in the righteousness of Christ.
The Lord can do nothing toward the recovery of man until, convinced
of his own weakness, and stripped of all self-sufficiency, he yields him-
self to the control of God. Then he can receive the gift that God is
waiting to bestow. From the soul that feels his need, nothing is with-
                                  [ 37 1
held. He has unrestricted access to Him in whom all fullness dwells.
Isa. 57:15."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 300.
     Contemplation of the last scenes in the life of Christ will draw the
soul nearer to God. This lesson should serve that purpose.
                            THE LESSON
     1. How has mankind gone astray? Which way have we gone?. What
has the Lord laid on Christ? Isa. 53:6.
     NOTE.—When a whole flock goes astray, it is generally because the
leaders have gone astray. Let the first sheep lead the way, and all the
rest follow. While God does not excuse those who have thus gone after
their own way, He understands that the chief responsibility is upon
the leaders.
     "The Lord bath laid on Him the iniquity of us all." "Whether they
know it or not, all are weary and heavy-laden. All are weighed down
with burdens that only Christ can remove. The heaviest burden that
we bear is the burden of sin. If we were left to bear this burden, it
would crush us. But the Sinless One has taken our place. . . . He has
borne the burden of our guilt. He will take the load from our weary
shoulders. He will give us rest. The burden of care and sorrow also
He will bear. He invites us to cast all our care upon Him; for He
carries us upon His heart."—"The Desire of Ages," pp. 328, 329.
     2. How was Christ treated? What did He not do? By what word
is His death here named? • How was His attitude before His judges
described in the prophecy? Verse 7.
     NOTE.—"He was oppressed." The word denotes harsh, cruel, and
arbitrary treatment, such as that of a slave driver. The same word
is used in Exodus 3:7.
     "As a lamb to the slaughter." Christ's trial was neither just nor
legal. It was not an execution but a slaughter.
    "He opened not His mouth." "Patiently Jesus listened to the con-
flicting testimonies. No word did He utter in self-defense. At last
His accusers were entangled, confused, and maddened. The trial was
making no headway; it seemed that their plottings were to fail.
Caiaphas was desperate. One last resort remained; Christ must be
forced to condemn Himself. The high priest started from the judg-
ment seat, his face contorted with passion, his voice and demeanor
plainly indicating that were it in his power he would strike down the
prisoner before him. 'Answerest Thou nothing?' he exclaimed; 'what
is it which these witness against Thee?' Jesus held His peace."—
"The Desire of Ages," p. 706.
    The power of silence! Many people understand the power of words,
of oratory. Few understand the power of silence. And yet it is just
as important to know when not to speak as to know when to speak.
    3. How was the scripture that "He opened not His mouth" ful-
filled? Matt. 27:12-14; Luke 23:8, 9.
    NOTE.—"Herod was irritated by this silence. It seemed to indicate
utter indifference to his authority. To the vain and pompous king,
open rebuke would have been less offensive than to be thus ignored.
Again he angrily threatened Jesus, who still remained unmoved and
                                  138 1
silent. . . . Christ's silence was the severest rebuke that He could
have given."—Id., p. 730.
    4. Where was Christ taken? What is said of the generations? Why
was Christ stricken? Isa. 53:8.
    NorE.—A paraphrase of this verse might read: "They did away
with Him unjustly, and who of His generation cared? 'He was cut
off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people to
whom the stroke was due.' " See American Revised Version.
    5. Where was His grave made? What had He not done? What
was not found in His mouth? Verse 9.
    NOTE.—The preceding verse states that Christ was unjustly con-
demned, and verse 7 calls the judicial murder a "slaughter." This
verse emphasizes the fact that Christ was sinless, that He had done
no violence, and that there was no deceit in Him. Had the leaders in
Israel diligently studied the prophecies, they could not but have seen
the parallel between Christ and Isaiah 53. They would have known
that Isaiah spoke of One who should be condemned unjustly, who
should patiently take the insults offered, who should not retaliate or
open His mouth in His defense. And when at last the rich Joseph
buried Him, had they read the prophecies they could but have seen
the climax of what was foretold.
    6. How was the prophecy as to Christ's burial fulfilled? Matt.
27:57-60.
    7. What did it please the Lord to do? What will take place when
His soul is made an offering for sin? Isa. 53:10.
    NOTE.—"It pleased the Lord." It was by "the determinate counsel
and foreknowledge of God" (Acts 2:23) that Christ suffered. It was
according. to the plan laid from eternity.
    "His soul an offering for sin." Christ "made Himself an offering
 for sin, that we might be justified before God through Him."—"Tes-
 timonies," Vol. 4, p. 374.
     Now when we shall present that offering before God, "He shall
 see His seed," that is, we shall then be reckoned among "the seed,"
 we shall be "heirs according to the promise." Gal. 3:29; Ps. 22:30.
 Christ "shall see His seed" among His true followers. "He shall pro-
 long His days." This is the resurrection. He shall live again.
     8. What will Christ see? What effect will this have upon Him?
 Verse 11, first part.
     Norn.—Christ shall see "the travail of His soul," that is, those for
 whom He labored and suffered. "Then, in the results of His work,
 Christ will behold its recompense. In that great multitude which no
 man could number, presented 'faultless before the presence of His
 glory with exceeding joy,' He whose blood has redeemed and whose
 life has taught us, 'shall see of the travail of His soul, and shall be
 satisfied.' "—"Education," p. 309.
     9. How will many be justified? Why? Verse 11, last part.
     NOTE.—The American Revised Version reads, "By the knowledge
 of Himself shall My righteous Servant justify many." The knowledge
                                   [ 39
spoken of here is the knowledge of experience. Christ was made a
perfect Saviour by the things He suffered. Heb. 2:10. To really know
Christ, that is, to know Him as we ought, is eternal life (John 17:3) ;
but such knowledge is gained only by experience. (See Phil. 3:10, 11.)
    10. What has stood throughout the ages as a great beacon of
truth?—Ans. Righteousness by faith.
     NOTE.—"Through all the ages the great truth of justification by
faith has stood as a mighty beacon to guide repentant sinners into the
way of life. It was this light that scattered the darkness which en-
veloped Luther's mind, and revealed to him the power of the blood
of Christ to cleanse from sin. The same light has guided thousands
of sin-burdened souls to the true Source of pardon and peace."—
"Acts of the Apostles," pp. 373, 374. It should be noted that justi-
fication and righteousness by faith mean the same thing.
    11. Of what do our churches sadly stand in need?
    NOTE.—"Our churches are dying for the want of teach ng on the
subject of righteousness by faith in Christ, and on kindred truths."—
"Gospel Workers," p. 301.
    12. What is righteousness, and how do we receive it? Rom. 4:3;
Gen. 26:5.
    NOTE.—"Righteousness is holiness, likeness to God; and 'God is
love.' It is conformity to the law of God; for 'all Thy commandments
are righteousness;' and 'love is the fulfilling of the law.' Righteous-
ness is love, and love is the light and the life of God. The righteous-
ness of God is embodied in Christ. We receive righteousness by re-
ceiving Him.
    "Not by painful struggles or wearisome toil, not by gift or sacri-
fice, is righteousness obtained; but it is freely given to every soul
who hungers and thirsts to receive it."—"Thoughts from the Mount
of Blessing," p. 34.
    13. What is the glory of God which closes the work of the third
angel? Rev. 18:1.
    NOTE.—"The message of Christ's righteousness is to sound from
one end of the earth to the other to prepare the way of the Lord. This
is the glory of God, which closes the work of the third angel."—"Tes-
timonies," Vol. 6, p. 19.
    14. What will God divide or give to Christ? Why is this given to
Him? Isa. 53:12.
    NOTE.—The picture here is of a conqueror returning from battle
and dividing the spoil. Men here make themselves a name by their
heroism and valor, and so Christ also is to be given "a name which
is above every name." Phil. 2:9. His "spoil" is the souls He has won
in battle. And this victory is won and this reward given "because He
hath poured out His soul unto death."
    The last time we gave a Thirteenth Sabbath Offering to the Inter-
American Division, there was an overflow of $4,352.66. The call this
quarter is for $105,000. Make your offering generous, so there will be
a liberal overflow.
