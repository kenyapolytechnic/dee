 ond quarter of 1928 are entitled "Lessons
 from the Life of David." That wonderful
 book, "Patriarchs and Prophets," is the

 tion of the book is the most serviceable
 for this purpose.

                                THE LESSON
   1. What were the distinguishing qualities of Saul, Is'rael's first
king? 1 Sam. 9:2.
   NorE.—"The personal qualities of the future monarch were such
as to gratify that pride of heart which prompted the desire for a
king. . . . Of•noble and dignified bearing, in the prime of life, comely
and tall, he appeared like one born to command."—"Patriarchs and
Prophets," p. 608.
 . 2. Under what circumstances did Saul disobey a divine command?
Km was his great sin regarded by the Lord? 1 Sam. 15:2, 3, 7-9, 23.
    NOTE.—"When reproved by the prophet at Gilgal, Saul saw no
great sin in the course he had pursued. He felt that he had been
treated unjustly, and endeavored to vindicate his actions, and offered
excuses for his error."—Id. p. 627.
                                        3
     3. What kind of king did the people desire? What did they even-
tually realize that God had given them? 1 Sam. 12:13.
     NOTE.—They had not sought counsel from God as -to the qualities
a ruler should possess, in order to preserve their distinctive, holy
character as His chosen people. They were not seeking God's way,
but their own way. Therefore God gave them such a king as they,
desired,—one whose character was a reflection of their own."—Id., p..
636.
   • 4. After rejecting Saul as king, what instruction did God give
Samuel? 1 Sam. 16:1,
    5. To relieve Samuel's fears, what plan was given him? Verses
2, 3.
     6. Who was called to the sacrifice? Verses 4, 5.
     7. Who among the sons of Jesse would Samuel have chosen as
king? Verse 6.
    8. Why had God not chosen him? Verse 7.
    9. When seven sons had passed before Samuel, what did he ask?
Who was sent for? Verse 11.
    10. How is David's appearance 'described? What command did
the Lord give to Samuel? Verse 12.
    11. Where did David get his training for service?
    NowE.—"The home of Samuel was a peaceful place in contrast with
the royal palace. It was here, amid the hills, that the honored servant
of the Lord continued his work. A company of seers was with him,
and they studied closely the will of God, and listened reverently to
the words of instruction that fell from the lips of Samuel. Precious
were the lessons that David learned from the teacher of Israel."—
Id., p. 653.
    "These schools [the schools of the prophets] proved to be one of
the means most effective in promoting that righteousness which 'ex-
alteth a nation.' In no small degree they aided in laying the founda-
tion of that marvelous prosperity which distinguished the reigns of
David and Solomon. The principles taught in the schools of the proph-
ets were the same that molded David's character and shaped his life."
—"Education," pp. 47, 48.
    12. What evidence of God's approval followed the anointing of
David? Verse 13.
     NorE.—"The great honor conferred upon David did not serve to
elate him. Notwithstanding the high position which he was to occupy,
he quietly continued his employment, content to await the develop-
ment of the Lord's plans in His own time and way. As humble and
modest as before his anointing, the shepherd boy returned to the hills,
and watched and guarded his flocks as tenderly as ever. But ,with
new inspiration he composed his melodies, and played upon his harp."
—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 641.
                                 [43
    13. Upon what did David meditate during these years? What was
his occupation? What effect was consequently produced upon his life
and upon succeeding generations? Psalm 8.
    NomE.—"In contemplation of God and His works, the faculties of
David's mind and heart were developing and strengthening for the
work of his after life. He was daily coming into a more intimate
communion with God. . . . The communion with nature and with
God, the care of his flocks, the perils and deliverances, the griefs and
joys, of his lowly lot, were not only to mold the character of David,
and to influence his future life, but through the psalms of Israel's
sweet singer, they were, in all coming ages, to kindle love and faith in
the hearts of God's people, bringing them nearer to the ever-loving
heart of Him in whom all His creatures live."—Id., p. 642.
    14. What do we End reflected in David's psalms? Ans.—His own
experience.
    NOTE.—"His [David's] soul is reflected in the psalms that must
be attributed to this period of his life, because so free from the pres-
sure of sorrow and anxiety, and the strife of tongues. Among them
are the eighth, nineteenth, twenty-third, and twenty-ninth."—"David,"
P. B. Meyer, p. 15.
    "The Psalms are a rich repository of experimental knowledge.
David, at the different periods of his life, was placed in almost every
situation in which a believer, whether rich or poor, can be placed."—
"Treasury of David," Vol. I, p. 145.
    15. Describe Saul's mental condition at this time. 1 Sam. 16:14.
    NOTE.—"When King Saul realized that he had been rejected by
God, and when he felt the force of the words of denunciation that had
been addressed to him by the prophet, he was filled with bitter rebellion
and despair. It was not true repentance that had bowed the proud
head of the king. He had no clear perception of the offensive charac-
ter of his sin, and did not arouse to the work of reforming his life, but
brooded over what he thought was the injustice of God in depriving
him of the throne of Israel, and in taking the succession away from
his posterity. He was ever occupied in anticipating the ruin that had
been brought upon his house. He felt that the valor which he had dis-
played in encountering his enemies, should offset his sin of disobedi-
ence. He did not accept with meekness the chastisement of God; but
his haughty spirit became desperate, until he was on the verge of
losing his reason."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 643.
    16. What remedy was suggested to and used, by Saul? How did he
 regard David? Verses 16, 21-23.
    17. How did the servant of Saul describe David? Verse 18.
                         MEDITATION TOPICS
   Unquestioning obedience by Jesse and his family to the prophet's
summons.
   Humility after anointing.

scribed? Verses 4-7.
    3. What challenge did he make to the hosts of Israel? Verses 8-10.
    4. What effect did this challenge have upon Israel? Verse 11.
    5. How long had Goliath thus defied their armies? Verse 16.
    6. Upon what errand was David sent? By whom? Verses 17, 18.
                                     [6 1
    NOTE.—"When war was declared by Israel against the Philistines,
three of the sons of Jesse joined the army under Saul; but David re-
mained at home. After a time, however, he went to visit the camp of
Saul. By his father's direction he was to carry a message and a gift
to his elder brothers, and to learn if they were still in safety and
health. But, unknown to Jesse, the youthful shepherd had been in-
trusted with a higher mission. The armies of Israel were in peril, and
David had been directed by an angel .to save his people."—"Patri-
archs and Prophets," pp. 644, 645.
    7. How did the Philistine's challenge affect David? Verse 26.
    NOTE.—"When David saw that all Israel were filled with fear, and
learned that the Philistine's defiance was hurled at them day after
day, without arousing a champion to silence the boaster, his spirit was
stirred within him. He was fired with zeal to preserve the honor of the
living God and the credit of his people."—Id., p. 645.
    8. How did his brethren regard his courage? In spite of their re-
proof, what spirit did David continue to show? Verses 28-30.
    NOTE.—"Even as a shepherd, David had manifested daring, cour-
age, and strength but rarely witnessed; and 'the mysterious visit of
Samuel to their father's house, and his silent departure had awakened
in the minds of the brothers suspicions of the real object of his visit."
—Ibid.
    9. To whose ears did David's words come? When brought before
Saul, what courageous words did he speak? What was Saul's reply?
Verses 31-33.
    10. In telling Saul of his strength, whom did David acknowledge
as his deliverer? What was his confidence regarding Goliath? Verses
34-37.
    NOTE.—"No one but himself had looked upon it in the right light,
as a conflict between light and darkness, truth and error, religion and
idolatry."—Wm. J. Deane.
    11. What efforts were made to afford David protection? Why
could not David use Saul's armor? Verses 38, 39.
    NOTE.—"David, in his humility and zeal for God and His people,
proposed to meet this boaster. . . . To put on Saul's armor would
give the impression that he was a warrior, when he was only little
David, who tended the sheep. He did not mean that any credit should
be given to the armor of Saul; for his trust was in the Lord God of
Israel."—"Testimonies," Vol. 3, p. 219.
   12. What striking contrast appeared in the equipment of these two
champions as they met for battle? Verses 4-7, 40.
   13. With what words did the giant approach David? Verses 43, 44.
    14. What reply did David make? What did David greatly desire
the whole world should learn from this conflict? Verses 45-47.
   15. 'What was the result of this personal combat? Verses 48-51.
                                  (7l
    NOTE.—"It is not too much to assert that this event was a turning
point in the history of the theocracy, and marked David as the true
king of Israel, ready to take up the Philistine challenge of God and
of His people, to kindle in Israel a new spirit, and, in the might of the
living God, to bring the contest to victory."—Edersheim.
    16. How complete was the victory of Israel on that day? Verses
52-54.
                          MEDITATION TOPICS
    Do we, as did David, place our trust in the protection and guidance
of God instead of in human equipment?
    David did not become irritated when others treated him as an in-
ferior. Do we?
    Zeal for the honor of God's cause on earth gave David his great
courage.

                            THE LESSON
    1. After David had slain the giant Goliath, what information did
Saul seek concerning him? .1 Sam. 17:55-58. •
    2. What friendship was formed while David was in the royal house-
hold? 1 Sam. 18:1-4.
    NOTE.--JOnathan was the eldest of the four sons of Saul, and one
of the noblest characters revealed in Old Testament history. His bril-
liant exploits recorded in 1 Samuel 13, 14 illustrate his bravery, his
faith, his generous spirit, and the esteem in which he was held by the
people. He perished with his father in the battle at Gilboa, and David
lamented his friend in an elegy of great beauty and pathos. 2 Samuel 1.
    "It was the providence of God that had connected David with Saul.
David's position at court would give him a knowledge of affairs, in
preparation for his future greatness. It would enable him to gain the
confidence of the nation. . . . And the friendship of Jonathan for
David was also of God's providence, to preserve the life of the future
ruler of Israel. In all these things, God was working out His gracious
purposes, both for David and for the people of Israel."—"Patriarchs
and Prophets," p. 649.
    3. At this time what position was given to David? How was he
regarded by the people and by Saul's servants? Verse 5.
    4. What event aroused Saul's envy? What complaint did he make?
Verses 6-9.
    NOTE.—"One great defect in the character of Saul was his love of
approbation. This trait had had a controlling influence over his actions
and thoughts; everything was marked by his desire for praise and
self-exaltation. His standard of right and wrong was the low standard
of popular applause. No man is safe who lives that he may please men,
and does not seek first the approbation of God."—Id., p. 650.
    5. After brooding for twenty-four hours, what did Saul do? Verses
10, 11.
    6. What was the cause of Saul's fear of David? What did Saul
plan because of his fear? Verses 12, 13.
    7. How did David conduct himself through these changes? What
effect did his attitude have upon Saul? Verses 14, 15.
    8. How did Israel regard David? Verse 16.
    NOTE.—"The people were not slow to see that David was a compe-
tent person, and that the affairs intrusted to his hands were managed
with wisdom and skill. The counsels of the young man'were of a wise
and discreet character, and proved to be safe to follow; while the
 judgment of Saul was at times unreliable, and his decisions were not
wise."—Id., p. 651.
    9. What suggestion did Saul make to David? How did Saul plan
in his heart to bring about David's death? Verse 17.
    10. What wise answer did David give? Verse 18.
    11. How was the insincerity of Saul shown? Verse 19.
                                  [9I
    12. What second plot was laid? With what result? Verses 20-30.
    NOTE.—" 'Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Phi-
listines;' but God shielded His servant. David returned, a victor, from
the battle, to become the king's son-in-law. 'Michal Saul's daughter
loved him,' and the monarch, enraged, saw that his plots had resulted
in the elevation of him whom he sought to destroy. He was still more
assured that this was the man whom the Lord had said was better than
he, and who should reign on the throne of Israel in his place."—Id.,
p. 652.
    13. What open command did Saul give? 1 Sam. 19:1.
   14. What two things did Jonathan do? Verses 2-5.
    15. What was the result to David of Jonathan's appeal? Verses
6-8.
    16. How did Saul make a direct attack on David's life? What did
Michal tell David? Verses 9-11.
    17. How did David escape? 'Where did he go? Verses 12-18.
    NOTE.—"David believed that the troops of Saul would not be or-
dered to invade this sacred place; but no place seemed to be sacred
to the darkened mind of the desperate king."—Id., p. 653.
    18. Still following his evil purpose, what did -King Saul do? What
was the experience of his messengers? Verses 19-24.
    NOTE.—"An angel of God met him [Saul] on the way, and con-
trolled him. The Spirit of God held him in its power, and he went for-
ward uttering prayers to God, interspersed with predictions and sacred
melodies."—Id., p. 654.
 • 19. What did this experience prove?
    NOTE.—"It proved incontestably that there was a divine power en-
gaged on behalf of David, against which the king of Israel would
vainly contend, which he could not resist, and which would easily lay
alike his messengers and himself prostrate and helpless at his feet.
If, after this, Saul continued in his murderous designs against David,
the contest would manifestly be not between two men, but between
the king of Israel and the Lord of hosts."—"Bible History," Eder-
sheim, Vol. 4, pp. 106, 107.
                        MEDITATION TOPICS
    It is dangerous to allow love of praise to govern our lives and
actions.
    Harm comes from harboring evil thoughts.
    David fled to the home of the man of God in the hour of trouble.
Where 'do we go?
    In the home of faith, as was Samuel's, precious lessons of life are
learned.

   "The Scriptures are not to be adapted to meet the prejudice and
jealousy of men. They can be understood only by those who are
humbly seeking for a knowledge of the truth that they may obey it."
—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 112.

                               THE LESSON
   1. Leaving Saul at Naioth, to whom did David go? What was his
plea? 1 Sam. 20:1.
    2. How did Jonathan express his belief in his father's change of
heart? What was David's answer? Verses 2, 3.
    NOTE.—"After the remarkable exhibition of the power of God,
Jonathan could not believe that his father would still harm David,
since this would be manifest rebellion against God. But David was
not convinced. With intense earnestness he declared to Jonathan, 'As
the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but a step between me
and death.' "—"Patriarchs and ProphetS," p. 654.
    3. What plan did David propose in order to find out what Saul's
intentions were toward him? Verses 5-7.
   4. What covenant was made between David and Jonathan? How
was Jonathan to let David know what Saul did? Verses 16-23.
    5. What happened at the feast in the king's house? Verses 24-34.
    NOTE.—When Saul heard the explanation Jonathan made concern-
ing the absence of David, "his anger was ungovernable. He declared
that as long as David lived, Jonathan could not come to the throne of
Israel, and he demanded that David should be sent for immediately,
that he might be put to death. Jonathan again made intercession for
his friend, pleading, 'Wherefore shall he be slain? What hath he
done?' This appeal to the king only made him more satanic in his
fury, and the spear which he had intended for David, he now hurled
at his own son."—Id., p. 655.
    6. How successfully did Jonathan carry out the plan made with
David? How is the parting of David and Jonathan described?
Verses 35-42.
    I\ToTE.—"Though Jonathan had never spoken of it, he was fully
aware of David's future destiny; more than that, he had sad presenti-
ment of the fate of his owri house. And yet, in full view of it all, he
believingly submitted to the will of God, and still lovingly clave to his
friend! . . . There is not a tinge of misunderstanding of David, not
a shadow of suspicion, not a trace of jealousy, not a word of murmur
or complaint."—"Bible History," Edersheim, Vol. 4, pp. 108, 109.
    7. Where did David flee? In reply to the priest's question, what
did David say? 1 Sam. 21:1, 2.
    NorE.—"The young man [David] was in constant fear of discov-
ery, and in his extremity he resorted to deception. David told the
priest that he had been sent by the king on a secret errand, one which
required the utmost expedition. Here he manifested a want of faith in
God, and his sin resulted in causing the death of the high priest. Had
the facts been plainly stated, Ahimelech would have known what
course to pursue to preserve his life. God requires that truthfulness
shall mark His people, even in the greatest peril."—"Patriarchs and
Prophets," p. 656.
    8. What did David procure from the priest? Where did he next go?
Verses 6-10.
    9. Why did David fear the king of Gath? What deception did
David practice in order to escape? Verses 11-15.
    NoTE.—"David had displayed noble traits of character, and his
moral worth had won him favor with the people; but as trial came
upon him, his faith was shaken, and human weakness appeared. He
saw in every man a spy and a betrayer. In a great emergency, David
had looked up to God with the steady eye of faith, and had vanquished
the Philistine giant. He believed in God, he went in His name. But
as he had been hunted and persecuted, perplexity and distress had
nearly hidden his heavenly Father from his sight.
    "Yet this experience was serving to teach David wisdom; for it led
him to realize his weakness, and the necessity of constant dependence
upon God."—Id., pp. 656, 657.
    10. What should David have done?
    NOTE.—"David ought not to have distrusted God for one moment.
He had cause for trusting in Him: he was the Lord's anointed, and
                                  [   12 1
in the midst of danger he had been protected by the angels of God;
he had been armed with courage to do wonderful things; and if he
had but removed his mind from the distressing situation in which he
was placed, and had thought of God's power and majesty, he would
have been at peace even in the midst of the shadows of death."—Id.,
p. 657.
    11. Where did David next flee? Who joined him there? 1 Sam.
22:1, 2.
    12. How did David express his trust in God? Psalm 57.
    13. Leaving his parents in Moab, where did he next flee? 1 Sain.
22:5.
    14. Realizing that some knew of David's hiding place, what did
Saul say? Verses 6-8.
    15. Who turned informer? What did he tell? Verses 9, 10.
    16. Enraged, what did Saul command? What answer did Ahime-
lech make? What cruel edict of the king was carried out? Verses
11-19.
    NoTE.—"When God had said that the iniquity of the Amalekites
was full, and had commanded him [Saul] to destroy them utterly, he
thought himself too compassionate to execute the divine sentence, and
he spared that which was devoted to destruction; but, now, without a
command from God, under the guidance of Satan, he could slay the
priests of the Lord, and bring ruin upon the inhabitants of Nob. Such
is the perversity of the human heart that has refused the guidance of
God."—Id., p. 659.
    17. Who felt that he was to blame for the death of Ahimelech?
Verse 22.
                         MEDITATION TOPICS
    The character of Jonathan, its nobility and unselfishness.
    The evil results of deception.
    Brooding on misfortunes means lack of faith.

    1. What was one of the means that David had for communication
with God? How did he use it? 1 Sam. 22:20, 21; 23:1-6.
    NOTE.—"The crowning feature in all the gorgeous dress of the high
priest was the breastplate worn over his heart as he officiated in the
holy of holies before the Lord. [For description see Exodus 28.] . . .
    "Set in the breastplate, one on either side, were two brilliant stones,
called the Urim and Thummim. By means of these stones the mind of
the Lord could be ascertained by the high priest. When questions were
asked, if light encircled the precious stone at the right, the answer was
in the affirmative; but if a shadow rested on the stone at the left, the
answer was negative.
    "The breastplate being attached to the ephod, David, in calling for
the priest to bring the ephod when he was undecided as to what course.
to pursue, was really asking for the breastplate, by which he might
know the mind of the Lord."—"The Cross and Its Shadow," Haskell,

    4. Who came to David in the wood of Ziph? What did Jonathan.
say? Verses 16-18.
    NOTE. "At this time, when there were so few bright spots in the
path of David, he was rejoiced to receive an unexpected visit from
Jonathan, who had learned the place of his refuge. Precious were the
moments which these two friends passed in each other's society. They
                                      [ 14 1
related their varied experiences, and Jonathan strengthened the heart
of David. . . . As they talked of the wonderful dealings of God with
David, the hunted fugitive was greatly encouraged."—"Patriarchs and
Prophets," p. 660.
    5. What report did the Ziphites make to Saul? What was Saul's
response? Verses 19-23.

    11. How did David's words affect Saul? What request did Saul
make? Verses 16-22.
    12. At this time, what great leader in Israel died? 1 Sam. 25:1.
    NOTE.—"The death of Samuel was regarded as an irreparable loss
by the nation of Israel. A great and good prophet and an eminent
 judge had fallen in death; and the grief of the people was deep and
 heartfelt. From his youth up, Samuel had walked before Israel in the
integrity of his heart; although Saul had been the acknowledged king,
 Samuel had wielded a more powerful influence than he, because his
 record was one of faithfulness, obedience, and devotion. We read that
 he judged Israel all the days of his life. . . .
     "It was when the nation was racked with internal strife, when the
 calm, God-fearing counsel of Samuel seemed to be most needed, that
 God gave His aged servant rest. Bitter were the reflections of the
 people as they looked upon his quiet resting place, and remembered
 their folly in rejecting him as their ruler; for he had had so close a
 connection with heaven that he seemed to bind all Israel to the throne
 of Jehovah."—Id., pp. 663, 664.
     13. Under what circumstances did Nabal of Carmel come into
 David's life at this time? What was Nabal's answer? Verses 2-12.
     14. What did David determine to do? How was -the situation re-
 ported to Abigail? Verses 13-17.
     15. How did the wife of Nabal meet the crisis? Verses 18-31.
     NOTE.—"Abigail revealed the strength of her devotion to her house-
 hold; and she made it plain to David that the unkind course of her
 husband was in no wise premeditated against him as a personal affront,
 but was simply the outburst of an unhappy and selfish nature. . . .
 Abigail presented by implication the course that David ought to
 pursue. He should fight the battles of the Lord. He was not to seek
 revenge for personal wrongs, even though persecuted as a traitor. . .
                                   [ 15 ]
Better impulses came to David, and he trembled as he thought what
might have been the consequences of his rash purpose."—Id., pp.
666, 667.
   16. What attitude did David take regarding her counsel? Verses
32, 33.
    NOTE.—"With a humble heart, he [David] received the rebuke. . . .
He gave thanks and blessings because she advised him righteously.
There are many who, when they are reproved, think it praiseworthy if
they receive the rebuke without becoming impatient; but how few take
reproof with gratitude of heart, and bless those who seek to save them
from pursuing an evil course."—Id., p. 667.
    17. After the death of Nabal, what did David do? What wives did
David now have? Verses 39-43. See "Patriarchs and. Prophets," p. 668.
    18. In what manner did opportunity to harm Saul come again to

harm Saul? 1 Sam. 26:1-12.
    19. What conversation did Saul and David again have? Verses
13-22.
    20. What course had others urged David to follow? In whom did
David place his trust? Verses 19, 24.
                            MEDITATION TOPICS
   David's lack of revengeful feelings and his courtesy toward. Saul.
   The character of Abigail as an example of true womanhood.
   The danger of losing contact with God so completely that repent-
ance for wrong, as with Saul, is merely temporary.

                                THE LESSON
    1. What discouraging thoughts troubled David? What plan did
they cause him to adopt? Where did he seek refuge? 1 Sam. 27:1, 2.
    NoTE.—"The Lord did not send David for protection to the Philis-
tines, the most bitter foes of Israel. This very nation would be among
his worst enemies to the last; and yet he had fled to them for help in
his time of need. Having lost all confidence in' Saul and in those who
served him, he threw himself upon the mercies of the enemies of his
people. David was a brave general, and had proved himself a wise
and successful warrior; but he was working directly against his own
interests when lie went to the Philistines. God had appointed him to
set up His standard in the land of Judah, and it was want of faith
that led him to forsake his post of duty without a command from the
Lord."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 672.
    2. What was the remit of such a course?
    NOTE.—"God    was dishonored by David's unbelief. The Philistines
had feared David more than they had feared Saul and his armies; and
by placing himself under the protection of the Philistines, David dis-
covered to them the weakness of his own people. Thus he encouraged
these relentless foes to oppress Israel. . . . Furthermore, the impres-
sion was received by his brethren that he had gone to the heathen to
serve their gods. By this act he gave occasion for misconstruing his
motives, and many were led to hold prejudice against him. The very
thing that Satan desired to have him do, he was led to do; for, in
seeking refuge among the Philistines, David caused great exultation
to the enemies of God and His people. David did not renounce his wor-
ship of God nor cease his devotion to His cause; but he sacrificed his
trust in Him to his personal safety, and thus tarnished the upright and
faithful character that God requires His servants to possess."—Id.,
pp. 672, 673.
   3. Who were with David when he went to Gath? What did Saul
cease to do? What request did David make of Achish? What place
was given over to David and his company? Verses 3-6.
   NOTE.—"In a town wholly separated for their use, they might wor-
ship God with more freedom than they could if they remained in Gath,
where the heathen rites could not but prove a source of evil and annoy-
ance."—Id., p. 673.
                                      [ 17 ]
    4. How long did David and his men dwell in the country of the
Philistines? How did they spend their time while in Ziklag? Verses
7-12.
    NomE.—"David knew that it was the will of God that those heathen
tribes should be destroyed, and he knew that he was appointed to do
this work; but he was not walking in the counsel of God when he
practiced deception."—Ibid.
    5. When the Philistines and the Israelites came together for battle,
who objected to David's presence, thus saving him from fighting
against his own people? 1 Sam. 29:1-11.
    Nom.E.—"The Lord, in His great mercy, did not punish this error
of His servant by leaving him to himself in his distress and perplexity;
for though David, losing his grasp on divine power, had faltered, and
turned aside from the path of strict integrity, it was still the purpose
of his heart to be true to God. While Satan and his host were busy,
helping the adversaries of God and of Israel to plan against a king
who had forsaken God, the angels of the Lord were working to deliver
David from the peril into which he had fallen. Heavenly messengers
moved upon the Philistine princes to protest against the presence of
David and his force with the army in the approaching conflict."—Id.,
p. 690.
   6. What happened at Ziklag in the absence of David and his band?
1 Sam. 30:1-5.
   7. What rash act was meditated by David's followers? Instead of
yielding to discouragement as at other times, what did David do?
Verse 6.
   8. After inquiring of the Lord, what action did David and his men
take? Verses 7-10.
   9. What aid did an Egyptian give them? How complete was
David's victory over his enemy? Verses 11-20.
   10. What event shows the spirit of justice in the heart of David?
Verses 21-25.
    11. Whom else did David unselfishly remember? Veises 26-31.
    12. What is said of the terrible battle between Israel and the Phi-
listines? How did Saul, the king, meet his death? 1 Sam. 31:1-6.
   13. What disposition did the Philistines make of the bodies of Saul
and his sons? How were they recovered? What was done to show
honor to the dead king and his sons? Verses 7-13.
  14. In what manner was the report of the battle brought to David?
What experience did the messenger relate? How did David and his
men show their grief? 2 Sam. 1:1-12.
   15. What was done to the messenger? Why was he so treated?
Verses 13-16.
   16. How did David feel at the death of Saul and Jonathan?
Verse 17.
                                 [ 181
      NOTE.—"David's grief at the death of Saul was sincere and deep,
  evincing the generosity of a noble nature. He did not exult in the fall
  of his enemy. The obstacle that had barred his access to the throne of
  Israel was removed, but at this he did not rejoice. Death had obliter-
• ated the remembrance of Saul's distrust and cruelty, and now nothing
  in his history was thought of but that which was noble and kingly.
  The name of Saul was linked with that of Jonathan, whose friendship
  had been so true and so unselfish."—Id., pp. 695, 696.
      17. How did David express his grief at the death of Saul and
  Jonathan? Verses 18-27.

    NOTE.—"Ishbosheth was but a weak and incompetent representa-
tive of the house of Saul, while David was preeminently qualified to
bear the responsibilities of the kingdom. Abner, the chief agent in
raising Ishbosheth to kingly power, had been commander in chief of
Saul's army, and was the most distinguished man in Israel. Abner
knew that David had been appointed by the Lord to the throne of
Israel, but having so long hunted and pursued him, he was not now
willing that the son of Jesse should succeed to the kingdom over which
Saul had reigned."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 698.
    "Mahanaim, on the farther side of Jordan, was chosen as the royal
residence, since it offered the greatest security against attack, either
from David or from the Philistines. Here the coronation of Ishbosheth
took place. His reign was first accepted by the tribes east of Jordan,

secluded capital. But Abner, intent upon extending his power over all
Israel, prepared for aggressive warfare."—Ibid.
    6. When Abner became incensed against Ishbosheth, what did he
do? Verse 12.
    NOTE.—"At last, treachery overthrew the throne that malice and
ambition had established. Abner, becoming incensed against the weak
and incompetent Ishbosheth, deserted to David, with the offer to bring
over to him all the tribes of Israel. His proposals were accepted by
the king, and he was dismissed with honor, to accomplish his purpose."
—Ibid.

  honor to Abner? Verses 28-35.
      13. What did the people understand? What did the king say to his

      NoTE.—"David's magnanimous recognition of one who had been his
  bitter enemy, won the confidence and admiration of all Israel. . . . In
  the private circle of his trusted counselors and attendants, the king
  spoke of the crime, and recognizing his own inability to punish the
  murderers as he desired, he left them to the justice of God."—Id., •
  p. 700.
      14. How did the news of Abner's death affect Ishbosheth the king
  of Israel and his people? What were the circumstances connected with
  the death of Ishbosheth? 2 Sam. 4:1-8.
      NoTE.—"Through circumstances over which he had no control,—
  allowed by Him who gives full liberty to each man, though He over-
  rules even the darkest deeds of the wicked for the evolving of good—
  David was left undisputed claimant to the throne of Israel. Faith,
  patience, integrity were vindicated; the divine promises to David had
  come true in the course of natural events—and all this was better far
  than even if Saul had voluntarily resigned his place, or Abner sue-
' ceeded in his plans."—"Bible History," Edersheim, Vol. 4, p. 162.
      15. What reward did'the murderers of Ishbosheth receive? Verses
  9-12.
      NoTE.—"David, whose throne God Himself had established, and
  whom God had delivered from his adversaries, did not desire the aid
  of treachery to establish his power."—"Patriarchs and Prophets,"

      16. What union was now effected? 2 Sam. 5:1.
      17. What did the elders of Israel acknowledge? What did they
  then do? Verses 2, 3.
      NoTE.—" 'So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron;
  and King David made a league with them in Hebron before the Lord.'
  Thus through the providence of God the way had been opened for him
  to come to the throne. He had no personal ambition to gratify, for he
  had not sought the honor to which he had been brought. . . . The
  change in the sentiments of the people was marked and decisive. The
   revolution was quiet and dignified, befitting the great work they were
  doing."—Ibid.
      18. How old was David when he began to reign? How long did he
   reign in Hebron? In Jerusalem? Verses 4, 5.
                           MEDITATION TOPICS

                                THE LESSON
    1. After David had become king of united Israel, what was one of
his first acts? 2 Sam. 5:6-9.
    NOTE.—"As soon as David was established on the throne of Israel,
he began to seek a more appropriate location for the capital of his
realm. Twenty miles from Hebron, a place was selected as the future
metropolis of the kingdom. Before Joshua had led the armies of Israel
over Jordan, it had been called Salem. Near this place, Abraham had
proved his loyalty to God. Eight hundred years before the coronation
of David, it had been the home of Melchizedek, the priest of the most
high Cod. . . .
    "In order to secure this location, the Hebrews must dispossess a
remnant of the Canaanites, who held a fortified position on the moun-
tains of Zion and Moriah. This stronghold was called Jebus, and its
inhabitants were known as Jebusites. For centuries, Jebus had been
looked upon as impregnable; ;but it was besieged and taken by the
Hebrews under the command of Joab, who, as the reward of his valor,
was made commander in chief of the armies of Israel. Jebus now
                                      [ 22]
became the national capital, and its heathen name was changed to
Jerusalem."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 703.
    2. What is said concerning David's experience? What did the king
of Tyre do? What did David perceive concerning his rule of Israel?
Verses 10-12.
    3. Hoping to overcome the young kingdom, who declared war?
What counsel did David seek? What was the result of the two com-
bats? Verses 17-25; 1 Chron. 14:16, 17.
    4. What cherished purpose did David now seek to gratify? 2 Sam.
6:1, 2.
    5. How did they mqve the ark and by whom was it accompanied?
Verses 3-5.
    6. What tragedy marked the journey? Verses 6, 7.
    NOTE.—"The fate of Uzzah was a divine judgment upon the viola-
tion of a most explicit command. Through Moses the Lord had given
special instruction concerning the transportation of the ark. None but
the priests, the descendants of Aaron, were to touch it, or even to look
upon it uncovered. . . . Thus in the bringing of the ark from Kirjath-
jearim, there had been a direct and inexcusable disregard of the Lord's
directions. . . .
   "God can accept no partial obedience, no lax way of treating His
commandments. By the judgment upon Uzzah, He designed to, impress
upon all Israel the importance of giving strict heed to His require-
ments. Thus the death of that one man, by leading the people to
repentance, might prevent the necessity of inflicting judgments upon
thousands."—Id., pp. 705, 706.
    7. As a result of his feelings in this matter, what did David do?
Verses 8-10.
    NOTE.—"Upon David the divine rebuke accomplished its work. He
was led to realize, as he had never realized before, the sacredness of
the law of God, and the necessity of strict obedience."—Id., p. 706.
  8. What was told to David concerning the ark? After three
months, what did he again attempt? Verse 12.
   9. How is the procession described? Verses 13-15, 17-19.
   NOTE.—"The solemn ceremonies attending the removal of the ark
had made a lasting impression upon the people of Israel, arousing a
deeper interest in the sanctuary service, and kindling anew their zeal
for Jehovah. David endeavored, by every means in his power, to
deepen these impressions."—Id., p. 711.
    10. What was another ambition of David's heart? 2 Sam. 7:1, 2.
    NOTE.—"The tabernacle built by Moses, with all that appertained
to the sanctuary service, except the ark, was still at Gibeah. It was
David's purpose to make Jerusalem the religious center of the nation.
He had erected a palace for himself, and he felt that it was not fitting
for the ark of God to rest within a tent."—Ibid.
                                [23 1
   11. How did the prophet Nathan express himself concerning
David's plan? Verse 3.
    NOTE. "But Nathan had spoken . . . from his own, though pious,
impulse, and not by direction of the Lord. Ofttimes our thoughts,
although springing from motives of real religion, are not God's
thoughts; and the lesson here conveyed is most important, of not
taking our own impressions, however earnestly and piously derived, as
necessarily in accordance with the will of God, but testing them by
His revealed word."—"Bible History," Edersheim, Vol. 4, p. 180.
   12. What is the substance of the message God sent to David by
Nathan? Verses 4-17.
                                              •
   13. On receiving the message, where did David go? In what spirit
did he receive the message that frustrated his plans? Verses 18-29.
   NOTE.—"He [David] thinks no more of the frustration of his cher-
ished design; his regret is swallowed up by his delight at the fair
probect before him; his heart is so full that he can not rest in his
palace, and he goes forth to the sanctuary where the ark was placed,
that he may pour forth his. soul to the Lord who had dealt so gra-
ciously with him."—"David: His Life and Times," Deane, p. 119.
   14. Instead of grateful submission, what spirit do many manifest?
   NoTk.—"Instead of gratefully submitting to the divine direction,
many fall back as if slighted and rejected, feeling that if they can not
do the one thing which they desire to do, they will do nothing. Many
cling, with desperate energy, to responsibilities which they are in-
capable of bearing, and vainly endeavor to accomplish a work for
which they are insufficient, while that which they might do, lies
neglected."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 712, 713.
    15. In his wars with surrounding nations, what insured David's
success? 2 Sam. 8:6, last sentence.
    16. What kindness did David now show to the house of Saul?
2 Samuel 9.
    17. What was now the extent of David's kingdom? Gen. 15:18.
    NOTE.—"The kingdom of Israel had now reached in extent the ful-
fillment of the promise given .to Abraham, and afterward repeated to
Moses: 'Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt
unto the great river, the river Euphrates.' Israel had become a mighty
nation, respected and feared by surrounding peoples. In his own
realm, David's power had become very great. He commanded, as few
sovereigns in any age have been able to command, the affections and
allegiance of his people. He had honored God, and God was now
honoring him."—Id., p. 716.

                                  THE LESSON
   1. What law had David violated? Deut. 17:17; 2 Sam. 3:2-5; 5:13.
   Nom.—"Flattery, and the subtle allurements of power and luxury,
were not without effect upon him. Intercourse with surrounding na-
tions also exerted an influence for evil. According to the customs
prevailing among Eastern rulers, crimes not to be tolerated in subjects
were uncondemned in the king; the monarch was not under obligation
to exercise the same self-restraint as the subject. All this tended to
lessen David's sense of the exceeding sinfulness of sin."—"Patriarchs
and Prophets," p. 717.
    2. What grievous sin did David commit? 2 Sam. 11:2-5; Ex. 20:14.
    3. What was the punishment for such a crime? Lev. 20:10.
    NoTE.—"None could foresee what would be the result should the
crime become known. The law of God pronounced the adulterer guilty
of death, and the proud-spirited soldier, so shamefully wronged, might
                                         25
avenge himself by taking the life of the king, or by exciting the nation
to revolt."—Id., p. 718.
  - 4. How did David seek to conceal his crime? 2 Sam. 11:6-13.
    5. Failing to get Uriah to visit his home, what further crime did
he plan? Verses 14, 15.
    NOTE.—"Every effort which David made to conceal his guilt proved
unavailing. He had betrayed himself into the power of Satan; danger
surrounded him, dishonor more bitter than death was before him.
There appeared but one way of escape, and in his desperation he was
hurried on to add murder to adultery. He who had compassed the
destruction of Saul, was seeking to lead David also to ruin. Though
the temptations were different, they were alike in leading to transgres-
sion of God's law."—Id., pp. 718, 719.
   6. How did Joab carry out the instruction of David? What mes-
sage passed between David and joab? Verses 16-25.
    7. After the days of mourning for Uriah h'ad passed, what did
David do? Verse 27, first part.
    NOTE.—"He whose tender conscience and high sense of honor would
not permit him, even when in peril of his life, to put forth his hand
against the Lord's anointed, had so fallen that he could wrong and
murder one of his most faithful and most valiant soldiers, and hope
to enjoy undisturbed the reward of -his sin."—Id., p. 720.
    8. How did God look upon David's sin? Verse 27, last part.
    NoTE.—"As time passed on, David's sin toward Bathsheba became
known, and suspicion was excited that he had planned the death of
Uriah. The Lord was dishonored. He had favored and exalted David,
and David's sin misrepresented. the character of God, and cast reproach
upon His name. It tended to lower the standard of godliness in Israel,
to lessen in many minds the abhorrence of sin; while those who did
not love and fear God were by it emboldened in transgression."—Ibid.
    9. Sent by God, what message did Nathan the prophet deliver?
2 Sam. 12:1-4.
    NoTE.—"To few sovereigns could such a reproof be given but at
the price of certain death to the reprover. Nathan delivered the divine
sentence unflinchingly, yet with such heaven-born wisdom as to engage
the sympathies of the king, to arouse his conscience, and to call from
his lips the sentence of death upon himself. Appealing to David as
the divinely appointed guardian of his people's rights, the prophet
repeated a story of wrong- and oppression that demanded redress."—
Id., pp. 720, 721.
   10. What sentence did David unwittingly pronounce? Verses 5, 6;
Ex. 22:1.
   11. What dramatic scene followed? 2 Sam. 12:7-12.
   12. Instead of excusing himself, what did David acknowledge?
Of what did Nathan assure him? Verses 13, 14.
                                 [ 26
    .13. What were some of the effects of David's sin? Verses 10-14.
     NOTE.—"There was a great change in David himself He was
broken in spirit by the consciousness of his sin and its far-reaching
results. He felt humbled in the eyes of his subjects. His influence was
weakened. Hitherto his prosperity had been attributed to his conscien-.
tious obedience to the commandments of the Lord. But now his sub-
jects, having a knowledge of his sin, would be led to sin more freely.
His authority in his own household, his claim to respect and obedience
from his sons, was weakened. A sense of his guilt kept him silent when
he should have condemned sin; it made his arm feeble to execute jus-
tice in his house. His evil example exerted its influence upon his sons,
and God would not interpose to prevent the result. He would permit
things to take their natural course, and thus David was severely chas-
tised."—Id., p. 723.
   14. What are some of the characteristics of David's repentance?
Ps. 51:3, 4, 7, 10, 14, 17.
   15. What is the lesson in this incident to us?
   NOTE. —"Immediately on his [David's] acknowledgment of his sin,
without the interposition of a moment's interval between his confes-
sion and the assurance, Nathan had said, 'The Lord hath put away
thy sin.' . . .
   "Penitent soul! dare to believe in the instantaneous forgiveness of
sins. Thou hast only to utter the confession to find it interrupted with
the outbreak of the Father's love. As soon as the words of penitence
leave thy lips they are met by the hurrying assurances of a love which,
while 'it hates sin, has never ceased to yearn over the prodigal."—
"David," Meyer, pp. 198, 199.
                       MEDITATION TOPICS
   One sin unrepented of leads to another.
   Tactfulness in giving, and humility in receiving, reproof.
   True repentance offers no excuse for sins committed.

                                THE LESSON
    1. How did David's son Absalom plan to kill Amnon, his eldest
brother? How was the plan carried out? With what result? What
tidings came to David? How was he comforted? 2 Sam. 13:23-36.
    NoTE.—Amnon was the eldest son of David. Absalom's mother was
Maacah. 2 Sam. 3:2, 3. "David had neglected the duty of punishing
the crime of Amnon, and because of the unfaithfulness of the king and
father, and the impenitence of the son, the Lord permitted events to
take their natural course, and did not restrain Absalom. When parents
or rulers neglect the duty of punishing iniquity, God Himself will take
the case in hand. His restraining power will be in a measure removed
from the agencies of evil, so that a train of circumstances will arise
which will punish sin with sin."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 728.
    2. Where did Absalom flee? What were the king's feelings? Verses
37-39.
    NOTE.—"After he [Absalom] fled to Geshur, David, feeling that
the crime of his son demanded some punishment, refused him permis-
sion to return. And this had a tendency to increase rather than to
lessen the inextricable evils in which the king had come to be involved.
Absalom, energetic, ambitious, and unprincipled, shut out by his exile
from participation in the affairs of the kingdom, soon gave himself
up to dangerous scheming."—Ibid.
    3. What plan did Joab formulate to bring back Absalom? 2 Sam.
14:1-3.
    4. In carrying out the plan of Joab, what request did the widow
bring to David? How did the woman bring Absalom to David's mind?
Verses 4-17.
   5. Whose hand did David discern in the widow's story and request?
Verses 18-20.
                                      [ 28
    6. On Absalom's return to Jerusalem, what attitude did David
take? What is said of Absalom's personal appearance? What experi-
ence resulted in the king's receiving Absalom? Verses 24-33.
    NOTE.—"Absalom was permitted to return to Jerusalem, but not
to appear at court, or to meet his father. David had begun to see the
evil effects of his indulgence toward his children; and tenderly as he
loved this beautiful and gifted son, he felt it necessary, as a lesson
both to Absalom and to the people, that abhorrence for such a crime
should be manifested."—Id., p. 729.
     7. When Absalom was restored to favor, how did he win the peo-
ple's hearts? 2 Sam. 15:1-6.
     NoTE.—"The influence of David's listlessness and irresolution ex-
tended to his subordinates; negligence and delay characterized the
administration of justice. Absalom artfully turned every cause of dis-
satisfaction to his own advantage. . . . Yet the king, blinded by affec-
tion for his son, suspected nothing."—Id., pp. 729, 730.
     8. What took place when Absalom went to Hebron? Verses 7-12.
     9. When news of Absalom's rebellion was brought to David, what
did he decide to do? Who accompanied him? Verses 13-23.
     10. Why did David command that the ark should be returned?
Verses 24-29.
     11. What was the manner of David's departure from Jerusalem?
 In what manner were loyal men to help defeat the counsel of Ahitho-
 phel? Verses 30-37.
     NoTE.—"The defection of Ahithophel, the ablest and most wily of
 political leaders, was prompted by revenge for the family disgrace
 involved in the wrong to Bathsheba, who was his granddaughter. . . .
     "-Upon reaching the top of the mount, the king bowed in prayer,
 casting upon God the burden of his soul, and humbly supplicating
 divine mercy. His prayer seemed to be at once answered. Hushai the
 Archite, a wise and able counselor, who had proved himself a faithful
 friend to David, now came to him with his robes rent, and with earth
 upon his head, to cast in his fortunes with the dethroned and fugitive
 king. David saw, as by a divine enlightenment, that this man, faithful
 and true-hearted, was the one needed to serve the interests of the king
 in the councils at the capital. At David's request, Hushai returned to
 Jerusalem, to offer his services to Absalom, and defeat the crafty
 counsel of Ahithophel."—Id., p. 735.
     12. What two contrasting events happened as David went on his
 way? 2 Sam. 16:1-14.
     NOTE.—"In David's prosperity, Shimei had not shown by word or
 act that he was not a loyal subject. But in the affliction of the king,
 this Benjamite revealed his true character. He had honored David
 upon his throne, but he cursed him in his humiliation. Base and selfish,
 he looked upon others as of the same character as himself, and, inspired
 by Satan, he wreaked his hatred upon him whom God had chastened.
  The Spirit that leads men to triumph over, to revile or distress, one
  who is in affliction, is the spirit of Satan."--Id., p. 736.
                                  [29 ]
    13. When Absalom arrived in Jerusalem, what profession of loyalty
did Hushai make? How did Hushai defeat Ahithophel's counsel?
Verses 15-19; 17:1-14.
    NoTE.—"He [Hushai] suggested a plan attractive to a vain and
selfish nature, fond of the show of power."—Id., p. 740. Hushai's plan,
by delay, gave opportunity for David's forces to prepare for the
struggle.
    14. How was word of their plotting sent to David? How were the
lives of the messengers guarded? Verses 15-21.
    15. Where did David take refuge with his followers? Understand-
ing what was lost in the acceptance of Hushai's plan, what did Ahitho-
phel do? Verses 22-24.
    16. What preparation did David make for the battle? 2 Sam.
18:1-5.
    NOTE.—"The king's solicitude, seeming to declare that Absalom
was dearer to him than his kingdom, dearer even than the subjects
faithful to his throne, only increased the indignation of the soldiers
against the unnatural son."—Id., p. 743.
    17. Where was the battle fought? How great was the loss of men?
Defeated in battle, what happened to Absalom? Verses 6-17.
    18. What story did the runners bring to David? Verses 19-32.
    NOTE.—David was at Mahanaim, "a strongly fortified city, sur-
rounded by a mountainous district favorable for retreat in case of
war. The country was well provisioned, and the people were friendly
to the cause of David. Here many adherents joined him, while wealthy
tribesmen brought abundant gifts of provision, and other needed sup-
plies."—Id., p. 742.
    19. How did David express his grief at Absalom's death? Verse 33.
    20. What was the effect of David's grief upon the people? How did
Joab rebuke the king? What did David then do? 2 Sam. 19:1-8.
    NOTE.—"Harsh and even cruel as was the reproof to the heart-
stricken king, David did not resent it. Seeing that his general was
right, he Went down to the gate, and with words of courage and com-
mendation greeted his brave soldiers as they marched past him."—
Id., p. 745.

    Reviling one in distress is of the spirit of Satan.

                                THE LESSON .
   1. By whom was David caused to number Israel? 1 Chron. 21:1.
   NOTE.—"With a view to extending his conquests among foreign
nations, David determined to increase his army by requiring military
service from all who were of proper age. To effect this, it became nec-
essary to take a census of the population. It was pride and ambition
that prompted this action of the king. The numbering of the people
would show the contrast between the weakness of the kingdom when
David ascended the throne, and its strength and prosperity under his
rule. This would tend still further to foster the already too great self-
confidence of both king and people. The scripture says, 'Satan stood
up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel.' The pros-
perity of Israel under David had been due to the blessing of God
rather than to the ability of her king or the strength of her armies.
But the increasing of the military resources of the kingdom would give
the impression to the surrounding nations that Israel's trust was in
                                      [ 31]
 her armies, and not in the power of Jehovah."—"Patriarchs and

    10. What conspiracy arose? What soldier who had heretofore been

Adonijah were spared for the time, but after the death of David they
suffered the penalty of their crime. The execution of the sentence upon
                                 [ 32 1

princes of Israel, with representative men from all parts of the king-
dom, to receive this legacy in trust. He desired to commit to them his
dying charge, and secure their concurrence and support in the great
work to be accomplished. Because of his physical weakness, it had
not been expected that he would attend to this transfer in person; but
the inspiration of God came upOn him, and with more than his wonted

                                  THE LESSON

   1. What lessons come to, us from, David's life as a shepherd?
1 Sam. 16:11-13; 17:34-36.
   NOTE.—"As humble and modest as before his anointing, the shep-
herd boy returned to the hills, and watched and guarded his flocks as
tenderly as ever. But with new inspiration he composed his melodies,
and played upon his harp. Before him spread a landscape of rich•and
varied beauty. . . . In the far-away distance rose the barren cliffs of
the mountain wall of Moab; above all spread the tender blue of the
overarching heavens. And beyond was God. He could not see Him,
but His works were full of His praise. . . . In contemplation of God
and His works, the faculties of David's mind and heart were develop-
ing and strengthening for the work of his after life. He was daily
coming into a more intimate communion with God. His mind was
constantly penetrating into new depths. . . . Who can measure the
results of those years of toil and wandering among the lonely hills?"
—"Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 641, 642.
   2. What experiences in the life of David show his personal bravery?
1 Sam. 17:34-37, 40-51; 26:6, 7.
   3. What incidents show that David cherished a Christian spirit
toward his foes? 1 Sam. 24:4, 5; 26:8-12; 2 Sam. 3:6, 31-39.
     NOTE.—"The burial of Abner was attended with public honors.
The army, with Joab at their head, were required to take part in the
services of mourning, with rent garments and clothed in sackcloth.
The king manifested his grief by keeping a fast upon the day of
burial; he followed the bier as chief mourner; and at the grave he
pronounced an elegy which was a cutting rebuke of the murderers.
. . . David's magnanimous recognition of one who had been his bitter
enemy, won the confidence and admiration of all Israel."—Id., p. 700.
   4. How did David exemplify true friendship? 1 Sam. 18:1; 20:41,
42; 2 Sam. 1:12, 17-27.
                                       [ 34 ]
  5. How does the psalmist express his desire to wait patiently on
God? Ps. 37:7; 40:1-3.
    6. What attitude did David take toward the working out of God's
will? 1 Sam. 16:13; 24:9, 10; Ps. 37:34.
    NOTE.—"The great honor conferred upon David did not serve to
elate him. Notwithstanding the high position which he was to occupy,
he quietly continued his employment, content to await the development
of the Lord's plans in His own time and way."—Id., p. 641.
    7. When overtaken in sin, how did David relate himself to correc-
tion and reproof? 2 Sam. 12:13, first part; Ps. 51:1-3.
   8. What was his attitude toward recognized sin? Ps. 32:5.
   9. How earnestly did David long for communion with God? Ps.
42:1-3.
    10. In what manner does the 'psalmist express the joy he finds in
prayer and communion with God? Ps. 63:1-4.
    NOTE.—"There were times when faith faltered, and he [David] did
foolish things, when his passion mastered him, when he fell into ter-
rible sin; deeper than the passion, was the passionate desire for holi-
ness; profounder than any sin, however heinous, was the attitude of
the soul which could say, 'My soul followeth hard after God.' "—"Liv-
ing Messages," Campbell Morgan, p. 163.
   11. How does he recognize the value of meditation upon the word
and works of God? Ps. 1:2; 77:11, 12; 139:17, 18.
    12. How does the life of David encourage us to hope in God's
mercy even though we have sinned? Ps. 51:5-14, 16, 17.
    NOTE.—"Many have murmured at what they called God's injustice
in sparing David, whose guilt was so great, after having rejected Saul
for what appear to them to be far less flagrant sins. But David hum-
bled himself and confessed his sin, while Saul despised reproof, and
hardened his heart in impenitence. This passage in David's history is
full of significance to the repenting sinner. It is one of the most
forcible illustrations given us of the struggles and temptations of
humanity, and of genuine repentance toward God and faith in our
Lord Jesus Christ. Through all the ages, it has proved a source of
encouragement to souls that, having fallen into sin, were struggling
under the burden of their guilt. Thousands of the children of God,
who have been betrayed into sin, when ready to give up to despair have
remembered how David's sincere repentance and confession were ac-
cepted by God, notwithstanding he suffered for his transgression; and
they also have taken courage to repent, and try again to walk in the
way of God's commandments."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 726.
   13. How does David exemplify the faith that conquers every
enemy? 1 Sam. 17:47; Ps. 3:3, 5, 6.
   14. In defeat and loss how fully did David's faith hold him stead-
fast? 1 Sam. 30-.6.
                                 [35 1
    NOTE.—"In this hour of utmost extremity, David, instead of per-
mitting his mind to dwell upon these painful circumstances, looked
earnestly to God for help. He 'encouraged himself in the Lord.' He
reviewed his past eventful life. Wherein had the Lord ever forsaken
him? His soul was refreshed in recalling the many evidences of God's
favor."—Id., p. 692.
    15. How does David express the need for tender love between
brethren? Ps. 133:1-3.
    16. What influence have David's songs had upon the world's
history?
    NOTE.—"The psalms of David pass through the whole range of
experience, from the depths of conscious guilt and self-condemnation
to the loftiest faith and the most exalted communing with God."—Id.,
p. 754.
    Wherever the word of God has gone among the nations of earth,
the psalms of David have had an uplifting, hopeful influence upon the
hearts and lives of men. In many lands even to this day they form the
background of the hymns of praise, and the foundations of an un-
wavering faith in the' triumphs of the kingdom of God. Their lofty
sentiments of loyalty to God, of submission to His will, and their touch
with the trials, temptations, and victories of human souls in the battles
of daily life make them an undying influence in the world.
    17. In view of David's loyalty to God, and his deep repentance for
sin, what estimate does God place upon his life work? 1 Kings 15:5.
    NOTE.—"Glorious are the promises made' to David and his house,
promises that look forward to the eternal ages, and find their complete
fulfillment in Christ. The Lord declared:
    " have sworn unto David My servant, . . . with whom My hand
shall be established: Mine arm also shall strengthen him. . . . My
faithfulness and My mercy shall be with him: and in My name shall
his horn be exalted. I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right
hand in the rivers. He shall cry unto Me, Thou art my Father, my
God, and the rock of my salvation. Also I will make him My first-born,
higher than the kings of the earth. My mercy will I keep for him for-
evermore, and My covenant shall stand fast with him.' Ps. 89:3-28."
—Id., pp. 754, 755.
    "Great had been David's fall, but deep was his repentance, ardent
was his love, and strong his faith. He had been forgiven much, and
therefore he loved much."—Id., p. 754.

    Can you not make the Thirteenth Sabbath "dollar day" with you?
"Souls are perishing for the word of life" in Japan and Korea, and
every dollar given will aid in bringing the light to those who are now
in darkness. "Some can bring large gifts to the Lord's treasury, others
can bring only mites; but every gift brought in sincerity is accepted
by the Lord. . . . My brethren and sisters, waste not your money in
purchasing unnecessary things. You may think these little sums do
not amount to much, but many littles will make a great whole."—

    1. What to the heavens declare? How does the firmament mani-
fest Him? Ps. 19:1.
 ' NOTE.--"God calls Upon men to see Hint in the wonders of the
heavens. 'Lift up your eyes on high,' He says, 'and behold who lath
created these things, that bringeth out their host by number: 110
calleth them all by. names by the greatness of His might.' Isa. 40 :26.
God would have us study the works of infinity, and from this study
learn to love 'and reverence and obey Him. The heavens and the earth
with their treasures are to teach the lessons of God's love and care and
power.",---"CounsOls to Teachers," pp. 456, 457.
    2.     what manner do day and night reveal God? Verse 2.

    NOTE.—All nature speaks of God, of His wisdom, His love, His
                                  37
glory. While speech or language is not theirs, yet their voice is heard
speaking to every human being.
                 "The spacious firmament on high,
                  With all the blue, ethereal sky,
                  And spangled heavens, a shining frame,
                  Their great Original proclaim:
                  Th. unwearied sun, from day to day
                  Does his Creator's power display,
                  And publishes to every land
                  The work of an almighty hand.
                 "Soon as the evening shades prevail,
                   The moon takes up the wondrous talc;
                   And nightly, to the listening earth
                   Repeats the story of her birth ;
                   While all the stars that round her burn,
                   And all the planets in their turn,
                   Confirm the tidings as they roll,
                   And spread the truth from pole to pole.
                                            • •
                 "What though in solemn silence, all
                   Move round the dark terrestrial ball?
                   What though no real voice nor sound
                   Amid their radiant orbs be found?
                   In reason's ear they all rejoice,
                   And utter forth a glorious voice,
                   Forever singing as they shine,
                  'The hand that made us is divine.' "
                                            —Joseph Addison.

    4. How universal is the voice of God in nature said to be? Verse
4, first part (see marginal reading).
    NOTE.—"Through the creation we are to become acquainted with
the Creator. The book of nature is a great lesson book, which in con-
nection with the Scriptures we are to use in teaching others of -His
character, and guiding lost sheep back to the fold of God. As the
works of God are studied, the Holy Spirit flashes conviction into the
mind. . . . In these lessons direct from nature, there      a simplicity
and purity that makes them of the highest value. All need the teach-
ing to be derived from this source. In itself the beauty of nature leads
the soul away from sin and worldly attractions, and toward purity,
peace, and God."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 24.
    5. Where is the sun represented as being placed? Ans.—In the
heavens. Verse 4; last part.
    6. What simile is used to represent the daily appearance of the orb

    7. In what words does the psalmist present the daily course of the
sun? How penetrating are the sun's rays? Verse 6.
    8. What is the character of God's law? What is its effect? Verse
7, first part.
    NOTE.—"The law is an expression of the thought of God; when
received in Christ, it becomes our thought. It lifts us above the power
of natural desires and tendencies, above temptations that lead to sin.
God desires.us to be happy, and He gave us the precepts of the law
that in obeying them we might have joy."—"The Desire of Ages,"
p. 308.
                                  [ 381
    9: How is God's testimony represented? What follows its accept=
ance? Verse 7, last part.
    NoTE.—"There is nothing more calculated to energize the mind and
strengthen the intellect than the study of the word of God. No other
book is so potent to elevate the thoughts, to give vigor to the faculties,
as the broad, ennobling truths of the Bible-. If God's word were
studied as it should be, men would have a breadth of mind, a nobility
of character, and a stability of purpose that are rarely seen in these
times. The search for truth will reward the seeker at every turn, and
each discovery will -open up richer fields for his investigations."—
"Counsels to Teachers," p. 460.
  10. What do the statutes of God do for the human heart? How is
man's understanding influenced by the commandment of the Lord?
Verse 8; Eph. 1:18.
    11. What is the result of godly fear? How complete are God's
judgments? Ps. 19:9.
    NOTE.--"If we were to cherish an habitual impression that God
sees and hears all that we do and say, and keeps a faithful record of
our words and actions, and that we must meet it all, we would .fear to
sin. Let the young ever remember that wherever they are, and what-
ever they do, they are in the presence of God. No part of our conduct
escapes observation. We can not hide our ways from the Most High.
Human laws, though sometimes severe, are often transgressed without
detection, and hence with impunity. But not so with the law of-God.
The deepest midnight is no cover for the guilty one. He may think
himself alone; but to every deed there is an unseen witness. The very
motives of his heart are open to divine inspection. Every act, every
word, every thought, is as,distinctly marked as though there were only
one person in the whole world, and the attention of heaven were cen-
tered upon him."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 217, 218.
    12. What comparisons are used to emphasize the ,desirability, of
God's judgments? Verse 10.
    13. What is the result of heeding God's statutes, laws, and judg-
ments? Verse 11.
    NOTE.—"God desired to make of His people Israel a praise and a
glory. Every spiritual advantage was given them. God withheld from
them nothing favorable to the formation of character that would make
them repreSentatives of Himself. Their obedience to the law of God
would make them marvels of prosperity before the nations" of the
world."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 288.
    14. What question does the psalmist ask? What personal desire
does he express? Verse 12.
    NOTE.—"Sin may be concealed, denied, covered up from father;
 mother, wife, children, and associates; no one but the guilty actors
 may cherish the least suspicion of the wrong; but it is laid bare before
 the intelligences of heaven. The darkness of the darkest night, the
 secrecy of all deceptive arts, is not sufficient to veil one thought from
 the knowledge of the Eternal. God has an exact record of every unjust
                                  [ 39 I
 account and every unfair dealing. He is not deceived by appearances
 of piety. He makes no mistakes in His estimation of character. Men
 may be, deceived by those who are corrupt in heart, but God pierces
 all disguises, and reads the inner life."—"The Great Controversy,"
 p. 486.
     Realizing all this, the psalmist pleads with God for cleansing, know,
 ing that He alone can try the heart, and apply the healing remedies
 to the soul. It is vitally important that each of us partake fully Of
 this same desire, nor rest until it is fulfilled to us.
     15. From what does David desire to be kept? Why did he desire
 this keeping power? Verse 13.
     Nom—The nature of presumptuous sin is not always understood.
 In VoluMe 5, pages 435, 436, the spirit of. prophecy speaks of pre-
 sumptuous sin as follows: "When the light shines, making manifest
 and reproving the errors that were undiscovered, there must be a cor-
 responding change in the life and character. The mistakes that are
 the natural result of blindness of mind, are, when pointed out, no
.longer sins of ignorance or errors of - judgment; but unless there are
 decided reforms in accordance with the light given, they then become
 presumptuous sins. The moral darkness that surrounds you will be-
 come more dense; your heart will become harder and harder, and you
 will be more offensive in the sight of God."
     16. What in particular did the psalmist desire should be under
 God's control? Verse 14, first part.
  • NOTE.—"He who beholds the Saviour's matchless love will be ele-
 vated in thought, purified in heart, transformed in character. He will
 go forth to be a light to the world, to reflect in some degree this mys-
 terious love. The more we contemplate the cross of Christ, the more
 fully shall we adopt the language of the apostle when he said, 'God
 forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ,
 by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.' "—
 "The Desire of Ages," p. 661.
     "It would be well for us to spend a thoughtful hour each day is
 contemplation of the life of Christ. . . . As we associate together, we
 may be a blessing to one another. If we are Christ's, our sweetest
 thoughts will be of Him. We shall love to talk of Him; and as we
 speak to one another of His love, our hearts will be softened by divine
 influences. Beholding the beauty of His character, we shall be
 `changed into the same image from glory to glory.' "—Id., p. 83.
