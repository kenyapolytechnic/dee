    The Next Thirteenth Sabbath Offering

             [Sabbath School Secretary of the European Division]
    HE fields which are looking for an overflow offering on Sabbath, March
1   30, have more than one third of the entire population of Europe. The
total appropriations voted for last year for all these countries amounted to
a little over $180,000, or about one dollar per thousand population. We feel
certain that our faithful Sabbath school members will give generously on the
next thirteenth Sabbath that the third angel's message may go rapidly to
the Roman Catholic lands of Europe.

                            LESSON 1
                THE GOD OF COMFORT
                         January 5, 1929
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Isaiah 54.
MEMORY VERSE: Isa. 54:10.
                              INTRODUCTION
     This first part of the lesson deals with the relation of God to His
church under the symbol of husband and wife. This idea forms the
basis of many references in both the Old and the New Testament.
Jer. 3:14; 31:32; 2 Cor. 11:2; Eph. 5:23-32. The Song of Solomon
is founded on this conception. To be untrue to God is called adultery.
Eze. 23:37. Hence we need not apply these lessons to Israel only.
They have an application now.
     The second part of the lesson deals with God's protecting care over
His people. He created the smith who is forging the weapon with
intent to torture God's people. In other words, God knows. He is
responsible. Trust Him, and all will be well. "No weapon that is
formed against thee shall prosper." That is our heritage.          •
                                THE LESSON
     1. Why is the barren told to break forth into singing? Isa. 54:1.
     NomE.—Israel is told to sing because the desolate has more children
 than the married wife. This, of course, is to be spiritually understood.
 Paul, quoting this verse in Galatians 4:27, refers to the story of Hagar
 and Sarah. Sarah was desolate. She had no children, and there was no
 hope of any. Hagar had a son, Ishmael. Abraham thought that Ish-
 mael might be the promised child, but God said, "My covenant will I
 establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear." "She shall be a mother
 of nations; kings of people shall be of her." Gen. 17:21, 16. That both
 Gentiles and Jews who surrender to Christ are included as the spiritual
 children of Abraham and Sarah is made clear by a comparison with
 Galatians 3:7, 16, 14.
     This has reference to a great ingathering of souls for Christ, and
 how God will greatly bless and prosper the work of the gospel in the
 last day when He finishes His work in the earth.
      2. What should be done to make room for this gospel ingathering?
  Verse 2.
      NOTE.—The prophet is here looking forward to the time when the
  gospel shall be preached to the ends of the earth. (See "Prophets and
  Kings," page 374, par. 1.)
      "Enlarge the place of thy tent." The work in the foreign fields
  must be ever extended. "Lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy
  stakes." At the same time, the work at home must be strengthened.
      3. What does God say shall take place on the right hand and on
  the left? What shall the seed inherit? What change shall come to the
  desolate cities? Verse 3.
                                      3
   NOTE.—"Thou shalt break forth," or "Thou shalt increase." It is
because of the great increase that shall come to God's people that
plans for enlargements are to be made.
   "On the right hand and on the left"—on all sides. (See Gen. 28:14.)
   "Inherit the Gentiles." Isaiah here looks away from the conception
which the Jews of his day had, that only Jews could be saved. The
redeemed will be saved from all nations, and the Gentiles will be among
them.
   "Desolate cities." Cities without godly inhabitants will hear the
message, and many living in them will accept it. God thinks of and
plans for the cities. Jonah 1:2; 3:2; 4:10, 11.
    4. What encouraging message does God send? What shall be for-
gotten? Verse 4.
    NOTE.—"Fear not." The preceding verses have mentioned the en-
largement that shall come to God's people. They shall inherit the
Gentiles and spread forth right and left. Does this seem too much,
Fear not. They shall not be ashamed. The Lord is with His people.
Their plans may seem ambitious and incapable of fulfillment, but the
living God never fails.
    "The shame of thy youth." "The reproach of thy widowhood."
Israel again and again had left the Lord, her lawful husband, and
gone after other lovers. Hosea 2:13. Hence the Lord considered the
vow broken, and did not regard Israel. Hosea 2:2. But these sad ex-
periences will be forgotten when God again returns to Israel.
   5. How is the Lord spoken of in relation to the church? By what
other three names is He called? Verse 5.
   NOTE.—"Thy Maker is thine husband." This explains the state-
ments in verses 1 and 4 concerning the "married wife" and "widow-
hood." That is, God is the husband of the church. This, of course, has
specific reference to Christ. Eph. 5:32.
   6. How had the Lord called Israel? Verse 6.
   NOTE.—The American Revised Version has "wife" instead of
"woman." The thought seems to be that although the church has left
her Lord, God calls her back again, once more to resume her place
as wife.
    7. What had God done for a small moment? What does He say
He will do? Verse 7.
   NOTE. —Because of their sins, God had forsaken His people, for "a
small moment." When this was written, the ten tribes had been carried
into captivity a few years previously, 721 B. C. (See 2 Kings 17:6,
18.) But though in captivity, Israel was not forsaken, for God's mercy
was still extended to them.
   8. What had God done "in a little wrath"? What will He now do?
Verse 8.
   9. To what is this likened? What had God sworn? What does He
now swear? Verse 9.
                                 I,4
    NOTE.—God here likens the carrying of the ten tribes into cap-
tivity to the time of Noah. Sin brought the Flood, and so sin had
brought this calamity. God had promised not to send another flood on
the earth, and here He promises not again to be wroth with His people,
nor rebuke them. Some have thought that God has not kept this prom-
ise. Did He not more than a hundred years later permit Judah to be
carried into captivity in the time of Daniel? And did He not finally
in A. D. 70 reject the whole Jewish nation?
    Note this: The captivity of the ten tribes in 721 B. C. was final.
There was no return. The captivity in the time of Daniel was not final.
There was a return. God rejected the Jewish nation and permitted
Jerusalem to be destroyed in A. D. 70; but before that time, He had
already established His New Testament church composed of such as
should be saved in Israel, together with the Gentiles, and this consti-
tuted the true church, the continuation of the church of Isaiah's day.
Hence God has kept His promise. The rejection of the nation did not
mean the rejection of individuals.
    10. What beautiful promise is given to God's people? Verse 10.
    11. What promises does God give the afflicted? Verses 11, 12.
    12. By whom shall the children be taught? What great blessing is
promised them? Verse 13.
    NOTE.—In John 6:45 Christ quotes this text. (See also 1 Thess.
4:9.)
    "Great shall be the peace." In a world of tumult, God's people will
have peace. Serene, confident, unperturbed, God's own will pass
through the perils of the last days. (See John 14:27; Ps. 119:165.)
    13. In what shall God's people be established? From what shall
they be far removed? Verse 14.
    14. What will be the fate of the enemies of God's people? Verse 15.
    NOTE.—"Not by Me." Should thy enemies unite and attack thee, it
is none of My doings, hence it shall not prosper.
    15. Who has created the smith and the waster? Verse 16.
    NOTE.—God's people need not fear any danger. The furnace may
be heated seven times hotter than usual, but God has created both the
fireman and the fuel he uses. These are in God's hands.
    16. What shall not prosper against God's people? What shall be
condemned? What is said to be their heritage? Of whom is their right-
eousness? Verse 17.


       "If those to whom God's money has been intrusted will be
   faithful in bringing the means lent them to the Lord's treasury,
   His work will make rapid advancement. Many souls will be won
   to the cause of truth, and the day of Christ's coming will be
   hastened."-7-"Testimonies," Vol. 9, p. 58.

                            LESSON 2
       GOD'S CALL TO RETURN; THE WORD
              THAT TRANSFORMS
                         January 12, 1929
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Isaiah 55.
MEMORY VERSE: Isa. 55:6, 7.
                           INTRODUCTION
   Salvation is freely offered to all, but it becomes available only to
those who enter into covenant relation with God.
   While God thus extends mercy to all, the door will not always be
open. God may be found now, later it may be too late. Therefore,
seek Him now.
                             THE LESSON
    1. Who is invited to drink of the water of life? What are they to
buy? How much does it cost? Isa. 55:1.
    NOTE.—"Every one that thirsteth." The condition for receiving the
blessings of God is not riches, for you may come without money. It is
not condition, or rank, or learning. It is simply your need. Are you
thirsty? Then come.
    Thirst is perhaps the greatest and most compelling of physical de-
sires. A man who is hungry will, after a while, quietly lie down and
die; the thirsty man will spend himself in mad strivings. His whole
nature is burning up. He must have water. This strong desire is com-
pared to spiritual thirst. David uses the same figure. Ps. 42:1, 2;
63:1. (See also John 4:13, 14.)
   The water signifies:
   Christ.—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 413.
   The Word.—"Steps to Christ," p. 93.
   Emblem of divine grace.—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 412.
   Spiritual life.—"The Desire of Ages," p. 190.
   Wine and milk are used as figures.
    2. What important question is asked concerning the spending of
money? What similar question is asked concerning labor? What ad-
vice is given? Verse 2.
    NoTE.—Spending money uselessly is sin. In this day when there
are people suffering for the necessities of life, when there is an even
greater spiritual need, we must be careful in the expenditure of every
penny. "Money is a trust from God. It is not ours to expend for the
gratification of pride or ambition. In the hands of God's children it
is food for the hungry, and clothing for the naked. It is a defense to
the oppressed, a means of health to the sick, a means of preaching the
gospel to the poor. You could bring happiness to many hearts by using
wisely the means that is now spent for show. Consider the life of
Christ. Study His character, and be partakers with Him in His self-
denial."—"The Ministry of Healing," p. 287.
                                 [ 6]
    "Eat ye that which is good." "God demands that the appetites be
cleansed, and that self-denial be practiced in regard to those things
which are not good. This is a work that will have to be done before
His people can stand before Him a perfected people."—"Testimonies,"
Vol. 9, pp. 153, 154.
    Applying this text to spiritual matters, there is no better spiritual
food than the word of God. On that we should feed morning, noon, and
night. Any substitution will prove disastrous. It is the bread,—the
very staff,—of life.
    3. What invitation does the Lord give? What will He make with
us? Verse 3.
    NOTE.—"An everlasting covenant." This covenant of grace was
first made in Eden. Gen. 3:15. It was renewed to Abraham. Gen.
22:18; 26:4, 5; 17:7. It was ratified by Christ on the cross. (See
"Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 370, 371.) And "in the last days of
this earth's history, God's covenant with His commandment-keeping
people is to be renewed."—"Prophets and Kings," p. 299.
    "The sure mercies of David." These mercies are the precious prom-
ises given to David, including ,the promise of the Saviour through
David's line. Ps. 89:1-5; 2 Sam. 23:5.
    4. Who is the leader and commander mentioned in verse 4?
    NoTE.—What is said here seems to have a very definite reference to
Christ, who is called David in Jeremiah 30:9 and Ezekiel 34:23, 24.
Christ is also the Son of David. Hence commentators rightly apply
these verses to Christ. Matt. 21:9; Luke 1:32.
    Christ is also a witness. John 18:37.
    5. Whom shall He call? What shall nations do? Verse 5.
    NOTE.—The thought in this verse is that Christ shall call nations
with whom He had not hitherto made any covenant, that is, the Gen-
tiles. These would be drawn to Him because God would glorify His
Son. In the death and resurrection of Christ, God did glorify the Son.
John 17:1; Acts 3:13-15.
    6. What are men called upon to do? Verse 6.
    NOTE.—The day will come when some shall seek, but shall not find.
Amos 8:11, 12.
    7. What must the wicked and the unrighteous forsake? How will
God treat the sinner if he returns? Verse 7.
    8. What does God say of His thoughts and ways? Verses 8, 9. (See
Jer. 29:11.)
    9. What is said of the rain and snow which come down from
heaven? What is said of His word? How will it not return? What
will it accomplish? 7n what will it prosper? Verses 10, 11.
    NOTE.—"It shall prosper." "The work of the sower is a work of
faith. The mystery of the germination and growth of the seed he can
not understand; but he has confidence in the agencies by which God
causes vegetation to flourish. He casts away the seed, expecting to
                                 [ 7]
gather it manyf old in an abundant harvest. So parents and teachers
are to labor, expecting a harvest from the seed they sow."—"Educa-
tion," p. 105.
    10. In what spirit are we to go forth in seed sowing? How is na-
ture said to rejoice? Verse 12.
    NOTE.—The word "for" connects this verse with the preceding one.
God will do His part. He will send rain and snow, but man must also
do his part. We must do the planting; God will give the increase.
    11. What transformation shall take place? What shall this be to
the Lord? Verse 13.
    NoTE.—Briers and thorns represent evil. Micah 7:4. By contrast,
the fir and myrtle would represent righteousness.
   "A name." "An everlasting sign." To turn briers and thorns, spir-
itually speaking, into beautiful and useful fir and myrtle, is a me-
morial to God's praise.

                            LESSON 3
        BLESSINGS TO JEW AND GENTILE;
              BLIND WATCHMEN
                January 19, 1929
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Isaiah 56.
MEMORY VERSE: Isa. 56 : 2.
                           INTRODUCTION
    This chapter is divided into two distinct parts. Verses 1-8 deal
with the promises of God to all who do His will. Lest some should
think that they themselves are left out, the strangers and the eunuchs
are especially mentioned. The Sabbath is vital to His covenant. The
keeping of the Sabbath in verses 2, 4, and 6, is shown to be one of the
conditions of receiving God's blessings. These promises and conditions
apply to all other peoples as well as to the Jews.
   Verses 9-12 state the condition of the blind watchmen. While we
need to be careful in any local application of these statements, we
must not forget that this is God's view of the situation. We peed to
pray God to make us faithful watchmen on the walls of Zion, and that
we be not charged with surfeiting or drunkenness. We should be
wholly clear ourselves of that which we condemn in others.
                            THE LESSON
    1. What are we told to keep and to do? What is near, and what is
about to be revealed? Isa. 56:1.
    NOTE.—"Keep ye judgment, and do justice," might well be trans-
lated, "Keep ye law, and do righteousness."—Pulpit Commentary.
This has a special application to this time. It has always been the
duty of God's children to keep His law.
   2. What is said of the man that keeps the Sabbath and refrains
from evil? Verse 2.
                               [81
    NOTE.—This blessing is not for the Jews only, but for "man" and
the "son of man." Neither is the blessing for the one who only once
does it, but to him who "layeth hold on it;" "holds to it," as Moffatt
translates the text.
    "Keepeth the Sabbath."' How much that includes! It requires
nothing less than holiness. "No other institution which was committed
to the Jews tended so fully to distinguish them from surrounding na-
tions as did the Sabbath. . . . To keep the Sabbath holy, men must
themselves be holy. Through faith they must become partakers of the
righteousness of Christ."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 283.
    3. What should the son of a stranger or the eunuch not say? Verse 3.
Verse 3.
    NOTE.—"Many from among the sons of the strangers were to learn
to love Him as their Creator and their RedeeNer ; they were to begin
the observance of His holy Sabbath day as a memorial of His creative
power; and when He should make 'bare His holy arm in the eyes of all
the nations,' to deliver His people from captivity, 'all the ends of the
earth' should see of the salvation of God. Many of these converts from
heathenism would wish to unite themselves fully with the Israelites,
and accompany them on the return journey to Judea. None of these
werd to say, 'The Lord bath utterly separated me from His people;'
for the word of God through His prophet to those who should yield
themselves to Him and observe His law, was that they should thence-
forth be numbered among spiritual Israel—His church on earth."—
"Prophets and Kings," p. 372.
    "Eunuch." As the eunuch could not become the head of a family in
Israel, he might fear that he could have no share in the hopes of Israel.
God here allays the fear that any physical disability will keep a man
out of heaven.
   4. What three things are mentioned of the eunuchs whom the Lord
addresses? Verse 4.
   NoTE.—"Keep My Sabbaths." Of all the Ten Commandments, the
fourth is the one chosen as the test and condition of one of the most
beautiful promises either in the Old or the New Testament, as men-
tioned in the next verse.
   "Choose the things that please Me." Christ pleased not Himself.
We are not to please ourselves. In eating or drinking, in dress or
adornment, in association or friendship, in the thousand decisions that
come to us daily, the question should always be: What will please Him?
    "Take hold of My covenant." The thought here is not merely to
"take hold of," but to hold fast, not to give up.
    5. What two things will God give to them? How is the name fur-
ther designated? Verse 5.
     NOTE.—"A place." This place will be "in Mine house and within
My walls." While this special promise is given to the eunuchs, we may
believe God is no respecter of persons. The same promise applies to
all. The eunuchs to whom these promises were especially given, would
have no sons or daughters. God, therefore, promises them something
                                 [9 ]
better. God will more than restore and make up for anything of which
we may in this life be deprived. Eph. 3:20.
     "An everlasting name." Some names will be blotted out. Some will
remain. Rev. 3:5.
     6. What do the strangers do that join themselves to the Lord?
Verse 6.
     NoTE.—"Serve Him." To join ourselves to the Lord means more
than to subscribe to a creed. It means service.
     To love the name of the Lord is to love all that name stands for.
     "His servants" means worshipers. It includes the act of worshiping
as also the mode and form.
    "Keepeth the Sabbath." This is included in true worship. Who-
ever "join themselves to the Lord" will be Sabbath keepers. It should
be noted that God here again selects the fourth commandment out of
all the ten as the test commandment.
    "Taketh hold of My covenant." He that "holdeth fast" the cove-
pant will ever experience the blessing of forgiveness of sin and the
renewing grace of God, and will be in harmony with God's law.
    7. Where will God bring the strangers? Where shall-they be made
joyful? What will God accept from them? What shall God's house be
called? Verse 7.
    NOTE.-"My holy mountain," Jerusalem, or the church of Christ.
Also symbolic of the new earth. Isa. 11:9; 65:25.
    "House of prayer," the temple. ("The Desire of Ages," p. 27.)
After "My house" had become "your house" (Matt. 21:13; 23:38) ;
that is, after God had rejected the temple and its services, any place
where God's people assemble is a place of prayer. Acts 12:5, 12; 16:13.
    "An house of prayer." Prayer is more than asking for things.
Prayer is communion. God's house is a "house of prayer for all people."
That is, all are invited to come and pray, not for themselves alone, but
for their neighbors here at home as well as in far-off fields. Thus in a
double sense God's house is a "house of prayer for all people."
    8. How does the Lord speak of Himself? What does He say of the
ingathering of the Gentiles? Verse 8.
    9. What is said to the beasts of the field and of the forest? Verse 9.
    NoTE.—Verse 9 begins a new section. The wild beasts are the
enemies of God's people, who are coming to devour the flock because
the shepherds are asleep. (See Eze. 34:7-10.)
    10. How are the watchmen described? Verse 10.
    11. What further is said of them? Of what are they incapable?
Which way do they look? For what reason? Verse 11.
    12. What do they say? With what will they be filled? 'What is said
of to-morrow? Verse 12.
    NoTE.—It would be unjust as well as untrue to make a general ap-
plication of these verses. There are many honest souls, priests as well
as people, who are living up to all the light they have. These God will
lead into still greater light. But there are also those to whom these
verses refer in all their force.

                           LESSON 4
     THE RIGHTEOUS AND THE WICKED IN
            THE DAY OF TROUBLE
                        January 26, 1929
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Isaiah 57.
MEMORY VERSE: Isa. 57: 15.
                          INTRODUCTION
   Verses 1 and 2 we have always and rightly applied to the time just
before the beginning of the plagues. God will cause some to sleep that
He may deliver them from the evil to come.
   Verses 3-13 speak of the condition of the wicked at the same time.
They make "sport" of God's true children, they go into depths of sin
and degradation. They weary of their own wickedness, yet they do
not repent.
   In that time of peril, God will not forsake His own. He will dwell
with the contrite and humble, and revive them. He will give them
peace. The wicked, on the other hand, will continue to throw up "mire
and dirt." For them there is no peace.
                            THE LESSON
    1. After describing the unfaithful watchmen, what is said of the
righteous? What happens to merciful men? What is not considered?
Isa. 57:1.
    NOTE.—"Taken away from the evil to come." Josiah was promised
that he would be taken away before the evil should come. 2 Kings
22:20. So with these. At the time when the Sabbath is the test, when
the watchmen are sleeping, when the day of trouble is approaching,
some will be "taken away from the evil to come."
    2. Into what shall they enter? How shall they rest? How have they
walked? Verse 2.       •
    NOTE.—"Into peace." "Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord
from henceforth." Rev. 14:13. They rest while the world goes on. The
last struggle is in progress. The two-horned beast of Revelation 13 is
publishing his decree that whoever will not worship the image of the
beast shall be killed. Rev. 13:15. God's people are entering into the
time of Jacob's trouble. It is a terrific final struggle. During this
time, some of God's people have entered "into peace." "Rest in their
beds."
    "Each one walking," rather "each one that walked," referring to
those who have entered into peace.
    3. What is said of the wickedness of evil men at this time? Verses
3-10.
    NOTE.—The following suggestions are offered concerning the mean-
ing of these verses:
    Verses 3-10 are in sharp contrast with that which precedes them.
God has been speaking of the righteous. Now He turns to the scoffers
                                  [ 111
that "sport" themselves. It is evidently the few righteous that still live
among them who are the object of this mocking. Even as Ishmael
mocked Isaac (Gen. 21:9), and as there shall come mockers in the last
days (2 Peter 3:3), so these mock. To make "a wide mouth," to "draw
out the tongue," are childish gestures, an evidence of a complete lack
of decency and self-respect.
     This description definitely points out who are meant in the follow-
ing verses. They are the "children of transgression," that debase them-
selves "even unto hell." Verses 4, 9.
     4. What does God say further of these wicked ones? What has God
done? Verse 11.
     NOTE.—"Thou hast lied." God here asks of whom these people are
afraid that they should think it necessary to lie. It can not be that
they are afraid of God, for they do not believe in Him. The thought
of lying to God is there also. Some of these people of rebellion profess
to be God's children—their very profession is a lie.
     5. What will God declare? Of what profit shall it be? Verse 12.
     6. How does God contrast putting trust in companions with putting
trust in Him? Verse 13.
     NOTE.—Trust is the characteristic Old Testament word for the New
Testament words "faith," "belief." It occurs one hundred fifty-two
times in the Old Testament, and is the rendering of Hebrew words sig-
nifying to take refuge, as in Ruth 2:12; to lean on, Psalm 56:3; to
stay upon, Job 35:14.
     7. What shall be said? Verse 14.
     NOTE.—"It shall be said," American Revised Version, margin.
     "Cast ye up." That is, make a highway by heaping up material for
it, and take all obstructions out of the way. (See Isa. 62:10.)
    8. Who is the speaker of these words? Where is His habitation?
What name is given Him? Where does He dwell? With whom also
will He make His abode? For what purpose? Verse 15.
    NovE.—"High and lofty One." The same as "high and lifted up"
in Isaiah 6:1. "Inhabiteth eternity." Lives forever, enthroned forever.
    "Holy." Even as God is love, so also He is holy. That, in fact, is
His name. Holiness includes all the characteristics of God.
    "I saw then what faint views some have of the holiness of God, and
how much they take His holy and reverend name in vain, without real-
izing that it is God, the great and terrible God, of whom they are
speaking. .
    "I also saw that many do not realize what they must be in order to
live in the sight of the Lord without a high priest in the sanctuary,
through the time of trouble. Those who receive the seal of the living
God, and are protected in the time of trouble, must reflect the image
of Jesus fully."—"Early Writings," pp. 70, 71.
    9. What will God not do? What reason is given for this? Verse 16.
    Nova.—God will not keep His anger, forever. Ps. 103:9. If God
did so, no one could stand before Him. God's actions are based on His
                                  [ 12
mercy. If God should hold all to strict accountability, none could
stand. Ps. 130:3.
    10. Why was God wroth? What did He do? What did the people
do? Verse 17.
    NOTE.—Covetousness is idolatry. Col. 3:5. "The greatest sin which
now exists in the church is covetousness."—"Testimonies," Vol. 1,
p. 194.
    "The law of tithing was founded upon an enduring principle, and
was designed to be a blessing to man. The system of benevolence was
arranged to prevent that great evil, covetousness. Christ saw that in
the prosecution of business the love of riches would be the greatest
cause of rooting true godliness out of the heart. He saw that the love
of money would freeze deep and hard into men's souls, stopping the
flow of generous impulses, and closing their senses to the wants of the
suffering and the afflicted. . . . Covetousness is one of the most com-
mon and popular sins of the last days, and has a paralyzing influence
upon the soul."—"Testimonies," Vol. 3, p. 547.
    "Smote him." Covetousness is here selected as the typical sin. For
this God was "wroth, and smote him." For example, see Acts 5:1-11.
    "I hid me." It is sin that separates from God. Isa. 59:2.
    "He went on." Israel did not heed. "He went on" in his own way.
How true that is of many professed Christians to-day!
    11. What has God seen? What will He do? What more will God
do? Verse 18.
    NOTE.—"I have seen." God is fully aware of conditions. "Will heal
him." He will heal the contrite ones. What a wonderful God is ours!
He knows our way, that we have gone astray. Yet He does not leave
us to ourselves.
    "I will lead him." Even though we have gone our own way, God
does not forsake us. He will still lead us. Though many have gone
their own way, God does not forsake them, but leads them until they
are brought back to Him!
    "Restore comforts." There is no real comfort in sin; but there is
wonderful comfort in the knowledge of sin forgiven.
    12. What does God create? What message is to be brought to him
that is afar off and to him that is near? Verse 19.
    NoTE.—"The fruit of the lips" means praise and thanksgiving.
Heb. 13:15.
    "Peace, peace." At the birth of Christ the angels sang, "Peace,
good will toward men." Luke 2;14. At the close of His ministry,
Christ said, "Peace I leave with you, My peace I give unto you." John
14:27; 16:33.
    13. To what are the wicked likened? Verse 20.
    14. For whom is there no peace? Verse 21.
     Nom—The wicked may engage in amusements and entertainments
to divert the mind, but true, enduring peace is found only in Christ,
and is not theirs.

                            LESSON 5
  TRUE FASTING; THE SABBATH RESTORED
              February 2, 1929
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Isaiah 58.
MEMORY VERSE: Isa. 58: 13, 14.
                           INTRODUCTION
    "What saith the Lord in the fifty-eighth chapter of Isaiah? The
whole chapter is of the highest importance."—"Testimonies," Vol. 8,
p. 159.
    This chapter is directed to God's people. "It is not the wicked
world, but those whom the Lord designates as 'My people,' that are to
be reproved for their transgressions."—"The Great Controversy," p.
452. "The prophet is addressing Sabbath keepers, not sinners, not un-
believers."—"Testimonies," Vol. 2, p. 36.
    "The fifty-eighth chapter of Isaiah is a prescription for maladies
of the body and of the soul. If we desire health and the true joy of
life, we must put into practice the rules given in this scripture."—
"The Ministry of Healing," p. 256.
                            THE LESSON
    1. How is the prophet told to make this announcement? How
should he lift up his voice? Who are to have their sins pointed out?
Isa. 58:1.
    NOTE.—"Spare not." Do not smooth matters over. Tell the truth.
    "Transgression." Sin is sin; righteousness is righteousness. The
trumpet note of warning must be sounded. We are living in a fearfully
wicked age. The worship of God will become corrupted unless there are
wide-awake men at every post of duty. It is no time now for any to be
absorbed in selfish ease. Not one of the words which God has spoken
must be allowed to fall to the ground."—"Testimonies," Vol. 4, p. 517.
    2. How regularly do His people seek Him? In what do they de-
light? What have they not forsaken? For what do they ask? In what,
further, do they take delight? Verse 2.
    NOTE.—"Daily." It is possible, then, to seek the Lord daily, to have
family worship and private devotions, and yet not be right with God.
What an alarming and heart-searching thought!
    These people delight to know God's ways. They are eager to know
the divine will, as eager as if they were in reality a people that prac-
ticed righteousness. They are not conscious hypocrites—quite the re-
verse. But they seem to lack a proper appreciation of what constitutes
true religion.
    "The ordinance of their God," the law.
    3. What complaint do they bring against God? Of what do they
say He takes no notice? 'What answer does God give? Verse 3.
    NoTE.—Having fasted, these people expect God to take heed and
give them due credit, or reward. Now they complain that God appar-
                                  U4 ]
ently has not seen them. They are willing to conform to all the require.
ments of religion, but they want recognition for it, they want pay.
   Real fasting presupposes such a seeking of God that worldly things
will be forgotten. True fasting permits of no other "business" than
that of seeking God. Merely to be hungry is not to fast.
    4. For what purpose do they fast? How does God say they do not
fast? Verse 4.
    NorE.—Fasting should humble the spirit and produce kindness and
love in the heart for others. The fasting here spoken of produced irri-
tation and ill feeling, even to the point of angry debate and "smiting."
    "Ye fast not this day so as to make your voice to be heard on high,"
American Revised Version. Their fast was not such that God could
hear them.
    5. What questions does God ask? Verse 5.
    NorE.—God disapproves of the kind of fasting here mentioned.
"Jesus said, 'When thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;
that thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in
secret.' Whatever is done to the' glory of God is to be done with cheer-
fulness, not with sadness and gloom. There is nothing gloomy in the
religion of Jesus."—"Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing," p. 131.
(See also Matt. 6:16-18.)
   6. What four things are mentioned as being included in true fast-
ing? Verse 6.
   NorE.—"Loose the bands of wickedness;" to free from unjust and
oppressive obligations.
   "Undo the heavy burdens:" literally, to untie the bands of the yoke.
   "Let the oppressed go free;" literally the "broken." Probably
such as through debt had forfeited their liberty. (See Neh. 5:8.)
   "Break every yoke." This includes all that hinders in any way.
Every yoke that holds you must be broken. Every sin must be put aside.
    7. What are we to do for the hungry? For the poor? For the
naked? From whom must we not hide? Verse 7.
    Norm—Read "Testimonies," Vol. 2, pp. 32-35.
    "In all our work, the principle of unselfishness revealed in Christ's
life is to be carried out. Upon the walls of our homes, the pictures, the
furnishings, we are to read, 'Bring the poor that are cast out to thy
house.' On our wardrobes we are to see written, as with the finger of
God, 'Clothe the naked' In the dining room, on the table laden with
abundant food, we should see traced, 'Is it not to deal thy bread to the
hungry?' "—"The Ministry of Healing," p. 206.
   8. What will come to those who do God's will? What is said of their
health? What will go before them? What will be their rereward?
Verse 8.                        .
   NorE.—"Righteousness shall go before." A life dedicated to doing
good can not be hid under a bushel. The fame of it will spread far and
wide and "go before." So also in regard to the life to come. Any good
done will go before and come up before God as a sweet savor. (See
Acts 10:4.)
                                  [ 15 ]
   "Glory of the Lord." Rereward means rear guard. As the pillar of
cloud and of fire was a protection to Israel, so God's people now are
promised God's glory as their protection. (See Ex. 14:19-25.)
   9. What shall be the experience of those who fast according to
God's conditions? What three things, however, must be taken away?
Verse 9.
   NOTE.—"Take away . . . the yoke," referred to in verse 6.
   "Putting forth of the finger," a gesture of contempt.
   "Speaking vanity," speaking evil.
   10. What other two conditions are mentioned? What promises are
given? Verse 10.
   11. 'What beautiful promise of guidance is given? How will the
Lord satisfy His own? What will they be like? Verse 11.
   NomE.—If we satisfy the afflicted soul, God will satisfy our soul.
   "A watered garden." "A spring of water." When the drought
comes, the test comes. In the dark days of life true Christianity re-
veals itself. It is for that specific time that these promises hold.
    12. What will happen to the old waste places? What will be raised
up? What will they who do this be called? Verse 12.
    NOTE.—"This prophecy also applies in our time. The breach was
made in the law of God when the Sabbath was changed by the Romish
power. But the time has come for that divine institution to be restored.
The breach is to be repaired, and the foundation of many generations
to be raised up."—"The Great Controversy," p. 453.
    "The prophet here describes a people who, in a time of general
departure from truth and righteousness, are seeking to restore the
principles that are the foundation of the kingdom of God. They are
repairers of a breach that has been made in God's law,—the wall that
He has placed around His chosen ones for their protection, and obedi-
ence to whose precepts of justice, truth, and purity, is to be their per-
petual safeguard."—"Prophets and Kings," pp. 677, 678.
   13. From what are we to turn away our foot? What may we not do
on the holy day? What three descriptive words are used of the Sab-
bath? Whom are we to honor? In what three ways may that be done?
Verse 13.
   NOTE.—"When the Sabbath commences we should place a guard
upon ourselves, upon our acts and our words, lest we rob God by appro-
priating to our own use that time which is strictly the Lord's. We
should not do ourselves, nor suffer our children to do, any manner of
our own work for a livelihood, or anything which could have been done
on the six working days. Friday is the day of preparation. Time can
then be devoted to making the necessary preparation for the Sabbath,
and to thinking and conversing about it. Nothing which will in the
sight of Heaven be regarded as a violation of the holy Sabbath should
be left unsaid or undone, to be said or done upon the Sabbath.
   "God requires not only that we refrain from physical labor upon
the Sabbath, but that the mind be disciplined to dwell upon sacred
                                 [ 16]
themes. The fourth commandment is virtually transgressed by con-
versing upon worldly things, or by engaging in light and trifling con-
versation. Talking upon anything or everything which may come into
the mind, is speaking our own words. Every deviation from right
brings us into bondage and condemnation."—"Testimonies," Vol. 2,
pp. 702, 703.
   Religion, Sabbath keeping, all spiritual exercises, should be consid
ered a privilege rather than a yoke. Only thus considered can they ever
be a delight.
   14. What should come as a result of true Sabbath keeping? What
promises are given? Who has said this? Verse 14.
    Nova.—"High places of the earth," that is, "I will carry thee tri-
umphantly over all obstacles."—Cambridge Bible.
   "Feed thee," cause thee to enjoy.


                LESSON 6
   A REDEEMER PROMISED TO A PENITENT
                PEOPLE
                          February 9, 1929
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Isaiah 59.
MEMORY VERSE: Isa. 59: 1, 2.
                             INTRODUCTION
    This chapter is a continuation of the preceding one. It reveals the
reason for the Lord's not hearing or answering the prayers of the
people. The people seem aware of their real condition, for in Isaiah
59:12 they admit that their iniquities are known to them, and that
their sins testify against them.
    The first fifteen verses of this chapter present a picture of terrible
backsliding. A profession of Christianity has been used as a cloak for
evil. Churchgoers have had a form of godliness without the power
thereof. They admit that they have been neither truthful nor just,
that they have made crooked paths, and, as the result, have stumbled
like blind men. The situation is not hopeless, however, for the Lord
Himself will gird up His loins like a man of war and deliver His
people.
    The lesson is clear. Sin will cause God to hide His face from us;
but in turning from our iniquities, God will cause the Redeemer to
come to Zion.
                               THE LESSON
    1. What is said of the Lord's power to save and of His ability to
hear? Isa. 59:1.
    NOTE.— This verse is God's answer to the complaint made in the
preceding chapter that God had not heard the requests of His people
though they had fasted and afflicted their souls.
                                   [ 17 ]
    2. What has caused separation between God and His people? Why
 has God hidden His face? Verse 2; Deut. 31:17.
    3. What has been defiled with blood and with iniquity? What is
 said of the lips and tongue? Isa. 59:3; 1:15.
    4. For what do the people not call or plead? In what do they trust?
 What do they speak? What do they conceive and bring forth? Isa.
59:4.
     5. What two illustrations are used? What happens if the egg is
 eaten, and what if it is crushed? Verse 5.
     NoTE.—A cockatrice, the same as adder or basilisk, is a venomous
 serpent. A double image is here used, that of a cockatrice and a spider.
 The hatching of a cockatrice's eggs doubtless refers to the hatching of
 schemes by wicked men. These schemes take time for development, and
 all that is involved in them may not at once be apparent. Many plans
 look innocent and do not seem fraught with danger, but there is death
 in them. Of such are all attempts at religious legislation. Ostensibly
 innocent and said to be for the good of the people, there is seen but the
 hatching of cockatrice's eggs. Whoever eats of the eggs, that is, are in
 favor of and fall in with such schemes, will reap the sure result.
     "That which is crushed." Some of the schemes will not materialize,
 but will be crushed. Opposition will develop. And it is at such a time
 that the real nature of the scheme will be revealed. It will break out
 "into a viper." Men will then show the spirit that animates them. As
 the figure of the cockatrice brings out the deadly nature of the schemes
 laid by wicked men, so that of the spider reveals the futility.
      6. What shall the webs not become? With what are they unable to
  cover themselves? What are their works said to be? What is in their •
  hands? Verse 6.
      NOTE.-A spider's web is designed to catch unwary insects. But
  here an additional application is made of the figure. While evil men
  are hatching out deep-laid schemes, presented under the figure of cocka-
  trice's eggs, they are trying to cover their real intention in a garment
  composed of spider's web. But who can shield himself in such a gar-
  ment? Men may think they can hide themselves and their schemes, but
  to God they appear as clothed in a garment of spider's web. God knows
  their secret machinations, and so do His people. When wicked men are
  trying secretly to hatch a viper, and think that no one knows what they
  are doing, somebody will step on the egg and reveal what is inside
  before the scheme is fully hatched. An example of this is , Haman's
• attempt on the life of God's people', as revealed in the book of Esther.
    7. To what do their feet run? For what purpose do they make
 haste? What is said of their thoughts and of their paths? Verse 7.
   8. Of what are they ignorant? What is not found in their goings?
 What do those not know who walk in crooked paths? Verse 8.
   9. What is said of judgment and justice? For what do they wait?
 What is the result? Verse 9.
                                  [ 18
    NOTE.—Thus far in the chapter God has spoken. Now the people
speak. Verses 9-14. Instead of proclaiming their own righteousness as
in chapter 58:3, they admit that the accusations against them are
justified.
    "Therefore," that is, because of the sins mentioned in verses 1-8.
    "Judgment," "justice." The American Revised Version has "jus-
tice" and "righteousness."
    "Wait fqr light." It is useless for anyone to wait for light so long
as he has pleasure in iniquity.
    10. What comparison is made with the blind? When do they
stumble? To what are they likened? Verse 10.
    11. What two illustrations are here used? For what two things ara
they said to look? Verse 11.
    12. What has been multiplied? What is done by our sins? What is
said of our iniquities and transgressions? Verse 12.
    NOTE.—"Our sins testify." What a tremendous statement! Sin
does not exist apart from personality. It exists only as it is committed
by, and belongs to, some one. Lies, envy, vice, impurity, hatred, greed,
pride. What a company! How repulsive! Yet these are the compan-
ions we choose; and after we have played with them, entertained them,
loved them, they turn around and testify against us. It is not the sins
of which we are unaware that will condemn us. It is the sins we know.
We do not need more light, but more life, more power.
   13. Name the seven sins mentioned in this verse. Verse 13.
   14. What is said of judgment and justice? What has happened to
truth? What can equity not do? Verse 14.
    NomE.—"Courts of justice are corrupt. Rulers are actuated by de-
sire for gain, and love of sensual pleasure. Intemperance has beclouded
the faculties of many, so that Satan has almost complete control of
them. Jurists are perverted, bribed, deluded. Drunkenness and revelry,
passion, envy, dishonesty of every sort, are represented among those
who administer the laws. 'Justice standeth afar off : for truth is fallen
in the street, and equity can not enter.' "—"Tlie Great Controversy,"
p. 586.
    15. What becomes of truth? Who makes himself a prey? How does
this affect the Lord? Verse 15.
    16. Why did the Lord wonder? What did His ,arm bring? -What
sustained Him? Verse 16.
    NomE.—"No man." (See Jer. 5:1.)
    "No intercessor," such as Moses and Aaron. Num. 16:47, 48.
    Though God found "no man" worthy of the name, yet He did not
fail, but brought salvation and righteousness.
   17. What did the Lord put on as breastplate and helmet? What
was His garment and cloak? Verse 17.
   NOTE.—God is here spoken of as a warrior going forth to battle for
His people. He is arming Himself with His own attributes,--right-
eousness, salvation, vengeance, and zeal.
                                  [19]
   18. According to what will God recompense His enemies? Verse 18.
   NoTE.—"According to their deeds." This is just. Rev. 22:12. The
judgment here mentioned is not that of the last day, but rather such
judgment as God metes out in this life to individuals and nations who
transgress. The captivity of the children of Israel and the fall of
Nineveh and Babylon are of this kind. This becomes clear from a
study of the following verse.
    19. What is the effect of God's judgments? What will 'God do when
the enemy comes in like a flood? Verse 19.
    NOTE.—"So," because of this. The result of God's punishing is that
men will fear the Lord. That, however, is not the case in the last judg-
ment, for that punishment is final, and will not result in men's fearing
the Lord. Hence we conclude that this is not the judgment of the
last day.
    Read "The Great Controversy," p. 600, first paragraph.
    20. To whom shall the Redeemer come? Verse 20.
    NoTE.—God shall come in "fury to His adversaries," verse 18, but
as a Redeemer to all that turn from transgression.
    21. With whom is the covenant? What is said of God's Spirit and
of His word? Verse 21.
    NOTE.—"Thee" refers to the Redeemer of verse 20. The seed is the
spiritual seed. Isa. 53:10.
   "My Spirit," "My words." The Spirit is in the word. John 6:63.
And that word is not to depart from our mouths "from henceforth and
forever."

                 LESSON 7
  THE FINAL TRIUMPH OF THE RIGHTEOUS
              February 16, 1929
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Isaiah 60.
MEMORY VERSE: Isa. 60:21.
                           INTRODUCTION
    This chapter deals with the glorious finishing of the work, and with
the new earth state. "This message will close with power and strength
far exceeding the midnight cry."—"Early Writings," p. 278.
    Here is brought to view the great ingathering of souls, and how God
will move upon men to support the work. Let our faith grasp these
promises, and they are ours.
                            THE LESSON
    1. What are God's people bidden to do? Why? Isa. 60:1.
    NOTE.—"The words of Christ through the gospel prophet, which
are but reechoed in the Sermon on the Mount, are for us in this last
generation: 'Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the
Lord is risen upon thee.' "—"Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing,"
p. 70.
                                 [ 20 ]
     "The world to-day is in crying need of a revelation of Christ Jesus
in the person of His saints."—"Testimonies to Ministers," p. 458.
     2. What shall cover the earth and the people? In contrast to this,
what shall be the experience of God's people? Verse 2.
     NOTE.—It is a strange contrast we see in the world to-day. On the
one hand there is a wonderful advance in all kinds of worldly learning.
Men delve into the secrets of nature and bring forth marvelous things.
At the same time there is a lamentable lack of true knowledge. The
fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom,         this fear men do not
have. Hence it is that the world has much powcz but little light; much
learning but little wisdom. The world, in spite - its boasted progress,
lies in darkness. But God's children are privileged to arise and shine.
     Read "Christ's Object Lessons," p. 41f-, paragraph 3; new edition,
p. 424.
     3. Who shall come to the light? What prominent persons are men-
tioned? Verse 3.
      NOTE.—"To those who go out to meet the Bridegroom is this mes-
 sage given."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 420. lucre is no doubt
that these verses found their fulfillment at the first coming of Christ,
 and they will be fulfilled again at His second coming. We shall yet see
 a large ingathering of souls, and, according to prophecy, some of these
will come from among the great of earth.
      4. What will they see as they lift up their eyes? Who comes from
 far and near? Verse 4.
      5. What will happen when they see this? Who will be converted,
 and who will come? Verse 5.
      NOTE.—"The forces of the Gentiles," or "the wealth of the nations,"
 as the American Revised Version gives it. While we may not look for-
 ward to a golden age here on earth, but rather to opposition and perse-
 cution, yet we may believe that God will grant His people favor for a
 little while before the storm breaks, and that these verses will find an
 application and fulfillment.
      "The great work of the gospel is not to close with less manifesta-
 tion of the power of God than marked its opening. The prophecies
 which were fulfilled in the outpouring of the former rain at the open-
 ing of the gospel, are again to be fulfilled in the latter rain at its
 close."—"The Great Controversy," pp. 611, 612.
      The 1844 movement and the Reformation were mighty movements,
 "but these are to be far exceeded by the mighty movement under the
 last warning of the third angel."—Id., p. 611.
      Read "The Great Controversy," pp. 611, 612.
      6. From what places are they said to come? What will they bring?
 Verse 6.
      NOTE.—The Ishmaelites to whom Joseph was sold were Midianites..
 Gen. 37:25, 36. The Ephahs were one of the tribes of Milian. Gen..
25:4. Sheba was a country of Arabia. The conversion of such self-
 seeking and roving tribes would constitute a supreme exhibition of the
 mighty power of God.
                                  [21 7
   "Gold and incense." Gold denotes wealth, and incense, worship.
    7. What should come up with acceptance upon the altar? Verse 7.
    NOTE.—"With acceptance." The thought is taken from the sacri-
ficial offerings of the Jews. Some offerings were called acceptance
offerings because the Lord accepted them as a recognition of consecra-
tion on the part of the offerer. (See Lev. 1 :4.) Of that nature were
the burnt offerings which denoted full and complete dedication to God.
These were brought to the altar and completely consumed upon it, thus
indicating that the Lord was well pleased. Lev. 1:1-9; see also Judges
13:19-23. "That he may be accepted before Jehovah" is the American
Revised Version rendering of the latter part of Leviticus 1 :3. Kedar
and Nebaioth are Arab tribes.
    8. What questions are now asked? Verse 8.
    NOTE.—"A cloud." Those that will be gathered in under the
preaching of the gospel are here spoken of as being so many that they
look like a cloud.
   "Doves to their windows." As doves wend their way homeward to
their accustomed window, so weary souls are turning to their God.
   9. What are the isles said to do? What do the ships of Tarshish
bring? For whom are their gifts? Verse 9.
   NOTE.—"Tarshish," in Spain, was considered very remote in the
days of Isaiah. It was in the west end of the Mediterranean Sea, far
removed from Judea. Even from these outlying places should souls
come, bringing gifts with them.
   10. Who will build up the walls? Who shall be ministers? What
has God done in wrath? What in favor? Verse 10.
    11. What is said of the gates? What will be brought? Verse 11.
    NOTE.—"These prophecies of a great spiritual awakening in a time
of gross darkness, are to-day meeting fulfillment in the advancing lines
of mission stations that are reaching out into the benighted regions of
earth. The groups of missionaries in heathen lands have been likened
by the prophet to ensigns set up for the guidance of those who are
looking for the light of truth."—"Prophets and Kings," pp. 375, 376.
    12. What will be the experience of nations that will not serve God's
people? Verse 12.
    NOTE.—Barnes gives the following explanation of this verse: "The
idea is, that no nation can flourish that does not obey the law of God,
or where the worship of the true God is not maintained. History is
full of affecting illustrations of this. The ancient republics and king-
doms fell because they had not the true religion. The kingdoms of
Babylon, Assyria, Macedonia, and Egypt; the Roman Empire, and all
the ancient monarchies and republics, soon fell to ruin because they
had not the salutary restraints of the true religion, and lacked the pro-
tection of the true God. France cast off the government of God in the
Revolution, and was drenched in blood. It is a maxim of universal
truth, that the nation which does not admit the influence of the laws
and the government of God must be destroyed."
                                   [ 22 ]
   13. How is the glorious state of the church further emphasized?
Verse 13.
   14. What will they do who have afflicted and despised God's people?
By what names will they be called? Verse 14.
   NomE.—This verse contains a promise like that in Revelation 3 :9.
   15. How have God's people been considered? What will God make
them? Verse 15.
   16. What symbol is here used to show how God provides for His
own? What shall the church know? Verse 16.
   NOTE.—As a child receives nourishment from its mother, so the
church is here pictured as being supported by the Gentiles, even by
kings. All wealth belongs to the Lord, and He will see to it that the
abundance of the Gentiles shall be used for the furtherance of the
gospel.
    17. What change will be brought about? What will the officer and
exacter be? Verse 17.
    NOTE.—The thought here is that God will ennoble and elevate that
which is of less worth. Souls whose value in their unsaved state may
be likened to wood, iron, and brass, will God increase in value to brass,
silver, and gold respectively. How often we see that! God will take an
uncouth, backward boy and change him into an efficient soul saver or.
competent administrator.
    "Officers peace." This phrase may be rendered: "I will appoint
peace as thy government and righteousness as thy ruler." This and the
following verses speak of the ideal condition of the church.
   18. What will no more be heard in the land? What will the walls
and the gates be called? Verse 18. ,
   19. What is said of the sun and moon? Who shall be our light and
glory? Verse 19; Rev. 21:23; 22:5.
    20. What will the sun and the moon not do? What will the Lord
be? What shall be ended? Isa. 60:20.
    NOTE.—"In the city of God 'there shall be no night.' . . . The light
of the sun will be superseded by a radiance which is not painfully
dazzling, yet which immeasurably surpasses the brightness of our noon-
tide. The glory of God and the Lamb floods the holy city with unfad-
ing light. The redeemed walk in the sunless glory of perpetual day."
—"The Great Controversy," p. 676.
    Read "The Ministry of Healing," pp. 504, 506.
    21. What shall "a little one" become? What will the Lord do in
His time? Verse 22.
    NoTE.—Compare Luke 12:32 with Revelation 7:9 to see how the
"little flock" becomes a "great multitude." In His own good time the
Lord will hasten it. Rom. 9:28.

   "The words of the living God are the highest of all education."—

                             LESSON 8
    BUILDERS OF THE OLD WASTE PLACES .
                         February 23, 1929
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Isaiah 61.
MEMORY VERSE: Isa. 61:1.
                           INTRODUCTION
    The first sermon Christ preached in His home town had for its text
Isaiah 61:1. Never should it be forgotten that our mission is the same
as Christ's. We are sent in His stead. John 17:18. 2 Cor. 5:20.
    Study with care the work outlined for Christ in the first three
verses. That work is our work. It is a work of healing, of comfort, of
good cheer. It will take us to the broken-hearted, the captives, the
mourners. It will cause us to "build the old wastes." The work will
be so evidently blessed of the Lord that men will recognize it, the riches
of the Gentiles shall come, and the message itself shall develop a
people clad in the garments of Christ's righteousness.
                            THE LESSON
   1. On what occasion did Jesus quote Isaiah 61:1 and part of verse
2? To whom did He apply these words? Luke 4:16-20.
   NOTE.—"Jesus stood before the people as a living expositor of the
prophecies concerning Himself. Explaining the words He had read,
He spoke of the Messiah as a reliever of the oppressed, a liberator of
captives, a healer of the afflicted, restoring sight to the blind, and
revealing to the' world the light of truth. His impressive manner and
the wonderful import of His words thrilled the hearers with a power
they had never felt before."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 237.
   2. What did Christ say was upon Him? For what purpose was He
anointed? Isa. 61:1, first part.
   NOTE.—Jesus was anointed with the Holy Spirit and power. Acts
10:38. In the Old Testament the priests were anointed, and also the
kings. Ex. 29:5-7; 1 Sam. 9:15, 16. It was a sign of appointment to
high office, and denoted consecration and dedication to it.
   "Anointed Me to preach." There is no higher office than that of the
gospel minister. It was to this Jesus was anointed, and the qualifica-
tions for the anointing are given in Psalm 45:7 and Hebrews 1:9.
Christ loved righteousness and hated iniquity, therefore, God anointed
Him.
   3. Whom should Christ bind up? To whom should liberty be pro-
claimed? For whom shall the prison be opened? Isa. 61:1, last part.
    NOTE.—"The broken-hearted." As the Samaritans bound up the
wounds of the man that fell among thieves (Luke 10:34), so Christ
was to bind up the broken-hearted, to comfort, to heal the sorrowing
and distressed. In this work we are to follow Him.
   "Proclaim liberty!' The only true liberty is freedom from sin.
John 8:32, 36; Rom. 6:18.
                                  [ 24 ]
   "Them that are bound." Men are bound by sin and unbelief, by the
customs and traditions of men. The worst prison is that which we
make for ourselves, the worst blindness is willful blindness. But Christ
came to open the prison, to give sight to the blind. Luke 4:18.
   4. What year and day did Christ come to proclaim? Who shall be
comforted? Isa. 61:2.
   NomE.—"Acceptable year." "The year of Jehovah's favor." Ameri-
can Revised Version. It may be well to contrast the year of Jehovah's
favor with the day of vengeance. Even as the year is much longer than
the day, so God's mercy is much more abundant than His wrath.
   "When Jesus in the synagogue read from the prophecy, He stopped
short of the final specification concerning the Messiah's work. Having
read the words, 'To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord,' He
omitted the phrase, 'and the day of vengeance of our God.' This was
just as much truth as was the first of the prophecy, and by His silence
Jesus did not deny the truth. But this last expression was that upon
which His hearers delighted to dwell, and which they were desirous of
fulfilling. They denounced judgments against the heathen, not discern-
ing that their own guilt was even greater than that of others. They
themselves were in deepest need of the mercy they were so ready to
deny to the heathen."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 240.
    5. What three things will God exchange for them that mourn in
Zion? Verse 3, first part.
    NoTE:—This is a message of courage for those who are downcast
and disheartened, for those who "mourn in Zion." This mourning is
the same as the sighing mentioned in Ezekiel 9:4. It is a mourning for
sin, not necessarily the sins of others, but their own. Read "The Desire
of Ages," p. 300.
    6. What will they be called? Why? Verse 3, last part.
    NomE.—"Trees of righteousness," literally "oaks" or "terebinths."
"They shall be sturdy oaks of goodness," Moffatt translates it. The
 same figure is used in Jeremiah 17:8.
    "That He might be glorified." God is to be glorified in His saints.
 He wants to reveal His character in us. His meekness,•His humility,
 His self-control and purity should be our standard of conduct.
    7. What shall God's people do? What shall they repair? How long
 have they been desolate? Verse 4.
    NOTE.—Read this verse in connection with Isaiah 58:12, and the
 note under Question 12, Lesson 5.
    8. What shall strangers and aliens do? Verse 5.
     NOTE.—This work will become so all-important to Many that they
 will let the Gentiles feed their flocks, while they go to feed the spirit.
 ually hungry world.
     9. What will God's people be named? What will they be called?
 What will they eat? In whose glory 'will they boast? Verse 6.
     NoTE.—"Priests." God's original intention was that His people
 should be priests. Ex. 19:6. Because of sin, Israel lost that privilege,
                                    C 25 ]
and it was given to one of the tribes only. Ex. 28: 1. In the New Tes-
tament this privilege is restored. 1 Peter 2:9.
    "Ministers." A minister is a servant. As Christ our Lord we are
to be among men as "he that serveth." Luke 22:27.
    "Riches of the Gentiles." Read note under Question 16, Lesson 7.
    "In their glory." "To their glory shall ye succeed," American Re-
vised Version, margin. The Gentiles glory in their riches. But the time
shall come when God's people shall succeed them and inherit even the
riches of the Gentiles.
    10. For what shall they have double? In what will they rejoice?
What shall come to them? Verse 7.
    NOTE.—The sense of this verse is that even as God's people have
suffered, so shall a double portion of joy be theirs. For an application
of this principle to the ungodly, see Revelation 18:6.
    11. What does the Lord love? What does He hate? What will God
direct? What is said of the covenant? Verse 8.
    NOTE.—"Love judgment," "hate robbery." The Septuagint reads,
"Love righteousness, and hate robberies of injustice."
    "Their work." This is a definite promise of the Lord's direction.
The American Revised Version reads: "I will give them their recom-
pense in truth," that is, wherein they have been robbed I will see to it
that they are recompensed justly.
    12. Where shall their seed be known? What shall all aclaiowledge?
Verse 9.
    13. In whom does the prophet say he will rejoice and be joyful?
What reasons are given for this rejoicing? Verse 10.
    NOTE.—"Garments of salvation," "robe of righteousness." The
covenant which God makes with His people (verse 8) includes the
promise of forgiveness of sins and their covering with the garment of
salvation. As the father, in the•parable of the prodigal son, threw his
robe over his son, so God throws His robe of righteousness over repent-
ant sinners. This is what is called imputed righteousness.
    "Whatever may have been your past experience, however discourag-
ing your present circumstances, if you will come to Jesus just as you
are, weak, helpless, and despairing, our compassionate Saviour will
meet you a great way off, and will throw about you His arms of love
and His robe of righteousness. He presents us to the Father clothed
in the white raiment of His own character. He pleads before God in
our behalf, saying : I have taken the sinner's place. Look not upon this
wayward child, but look on Me. Does Satan plead loudly against our
souls, accusing of sin, and claiming us as his prey, the blood of Christ
pleads with greater power."—"Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing,"
p. 21.
    "Bridegroom," "bride." (See Rev. 19:7, 8.)
    14. What comparison does the Lord here make between the garden
which "causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth" and His
righteousness? Verse 11.
    NOTE.—Read "The Acts of the Apostles," p. 560.
                                 [26]
                            LESSON 9
THE HOLY PEOPLE; THE LORD'S REDEEMED
             March 2, 1929
LESSON SCRIPTURE : Isaiah 62.
MEMORY VERSE: Isa. 62:6.
                           INTRODUCTION
   This chapter brings to view the high position to which God calls
His people in Christ Jesus. Before the end conies, God will have a holy
people, whose righteousness will be evident to all men, Gentiles and
kings alike. God Himself will find joy in them. They will be His crown
of glory and royal diadem. They will be a praying people, faithful
watchmen on the walls• of Zion.
   We shall miss the lesson of this chapter if we apply it only to other
times and peoples. We shall also miss it if we apply the lesson to a
people rather than to ourselves individually. God will not merely have
a holy people, He wants me to be holy. Personal sanctification is the
aim of the truth.
                             THE LESSON
   1. For whose sake does God say He will not rest or hold His peace?
How will righteousness and salvation go forth? Isa. 62:1.
   NOTE. Zion and Jerusalem stand for God's people.
   "Righteousness," "salvation." God is here revealed as having
purposed to present His people before the world in the garment of
righteousness and salvation, and that He will not rest until it is accom-
plished. It is not that God will reveal Himself directly, but that He
will reveal His people to the world.
   2. What will the Gentiles and kings see? By what will God's people
be called? Who decides upon this new name? Verse 2.
   NOTE.—"A new name." After Jacob had wrestled all night with
the Angel, his old name no longer fitted him. He had passed through
a new experience, and he was a changed man. So his name was changed
because he was changed. Gen. 32:28. In like manner here. God's
people will have an entirely new experience, and their new name will
indicate that change. Rev. 2:17.
    3. What two things are God's people said to be in the hand of the
Lord? Verse 3.
    NOTE.—"Crown of glory." "Royal diadem." As a person might
hold an object of beauty in his hand for others to admire, so the Lord
is here shown exhibiting His people to the world. They are to Him a
crown of glory and a royal diadem.
    These verses have a present application, and they will see their ful-
fillment in this generation; therefore, a great work lies before us. It
concerns first and chiefly our own relation to God. If we are to be
exhibited to the world as the handiwork of God, we should be greatly
concerned about our progress in holiness.
    Read "Testimonies," Vol. 2, p. 355.
                                 [27]
     4. What will God's people no more be termed? What wit the land
 not be called? What names will be given to the people and the land?
  Why? What is said of the land? Verse 4.
     NOTE.—"Flephzi-bah" means "delight," and "Beulah" means "mar-
 ried." (See margin.) This figure recalls Isaiah 54:1, where it denotes
 the fruitfulness, the increase that shall come in souls saved. _
     5. What illustration is here used? How will God rejoice? Verse 5.
     NOTE.—Two figures are here used. First, God's people, under a
 symbol of sons, are married to the land, the virgin; second, God, as the
 bridegroom, is married to the bride, His people.
     In Revelation the New Jerusalem in which are God's people is
 spoken of as coming down from heaven as the bride, and Christ is the
 bridegroom. Rev. 21:9, 10. So in like manner the figure is here used.
     6. Whom has God set upon the walls? What shall they never do?
 Verse 6, first part.
     NoTE.—"The watchmen anciently placed upon the walls of Jerusa-
 lem and other cities, occupied a most responsible position. Upon their
 faithfulness depended the safety of all within those cities. When dan-
 ger was apprehended, they were not to keep silent day or night. Every
 few moments they were required to call to one another, to see if all
 were awake, and no harm had come to any. Sentinels were stationed
 upon some eminence overlooking the important posts to be guarded,
 and the cry of warning or of good cheer was sounded from them. This
 was borne from one to another, each repeating the words, till it went
 the entire rounds of the city.
     "These watchmen represent the ministry, upon whose fidelity de-
pends the salvation of souls. The stewards of the mysteries of God
should stand as watchmen upon the walls of Zion; and if they see the
sword coming, they should sound the note of warning. If they are
sleepy sentinels, and their spiritual senses are so benumbed that they
see and realize no danger, and the people perish, God will require their
blood at the watchmen's hands."—"Testimonies," Vol. 4, pp. 402, 403.
     7. What are those not to do who make mention of the Lord? Verse
6, last part.
     NOTE.—"The Lord's remembrancers," margin. A strange expres-
sion, yet an appropriate one. In these last days when the whole world
is prone to forget His law and His memorial, "the Lord's remem-
brancers" are admonished not to keep silence.
     8. What are they told not to give the Lord? Until what time?
Verse 7.
     NoTE.—"Give Him no rest." This is said as an encouragement to
prayer, to "pray without ceasing." 1 Thess. 5:17.
    "Let all who are afflicted or unjustly used, cry to God. Turn away
from those whose hearts are as steel, and make your requests known to
your Maker. Never is one repulsed who comes to Him with a contrite
heart. Not one sincere prayer is lost. Amid the anthems of the celes-
tial choir, God hears the cries of the weakest human being. We pour
out our heart's desire in our closets, we breathe a prayer as we walk by
                                   [ 281
the way, and our words reach the throne of the Monarch of the uni-
verse. They may be inaudible to any human ear, but they can not die
away into silence, nor can they be lost through the activities of busi-
ness that are going on. Nothing can drown the soul's desire. It rises
above the din of the street, above the confusion of the multitude, to
the heavenly courts. It is God to whom we are speaking, and our
prayer is heard."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 174.
    A similar lesson is taught by the parable of the importunate friend.
Luke 11:5-8.
    9. By what has the Lord sworn? What has He sworn? Verse 8.
    10. What shall they do who have gathered the corn and the wine
and have brought it together? Verse 9.
    11. What command is given? For whom is the way to be prepared?
What is to be done to the highway and the stones? What is to be
lifted up? Verse 10.
    NorrE.—"Go through the gates." Spread out. Proclaim the message
beyond your own gates. "Prepare ye the way." Do everything in your
power to help those in need. Remove every hindrance. "Lift up a
standard." "The commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus" is
such a standard. Rdv. 14:12.
    12. What message has God proclaimed to those living in the end of
the world? What is said of His reward and work? Verse 11.
    NOTE.—"Thy salvation cometh." This is the message of the second
advent, and it is to be sounded to the ends of the earth. It will be
accompanied with a judgment message, for "His reward is with Him."
Rev. 22:12.
    "His work," recompense, margin. Christ comes both with a reward
and a recompense.
    13. By what four names will the people be called? Verse 12.


                  LESSON 10
       AFFLICTED FOR HIS PEOPLE'S SAKE
                  March 9, 1929
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Isaiah 63.
MEMORY VERSE: Isa. 63:9.
                           INTRODUCTION
   Isaiah 63:1-6 presents a dreadful description of God's wrath; but
these verses also hold a peculiar beauty and fascination. A view is
given of God's going forth in fury to trample the people in His wrath.
Their blood is sprinkled upon His garments, which are crimson, as are
the garments of one who treads the winefat. In the midst of this de-
scription is the statement of Christ's treading the wine press alone.
This may at first seem irrelevant and contradictory to the rest of the
section. How can one be reconciled with the other? May it not be that
                                 [29 1
as God is considering the effect of sin, the suffering and misery that
it has caused both on earth and in heaven, culminating in the terrible
struggle of the Son of God with powers of darkness in Gethsemane and
Golgotha, forsaken and alone—that this thought makes it possible for
Him to execute the final punishment for sin which is. a strange work
for God to do? Isa. 28:21.
    The next section, verses 7-14, tells of God's goodness and mercy, of
His participation in Israel's afflictions, and also of Israel's rebellion
against God and His Holy Spirit.
    Verses 15-19 are a prayer, some passages of which, in particular
verse 15, are of surpassing beauty.
                             THE LESSON
    1. After the words of comfort in the last of the preceding chapter,
what question is asked? What is said of the garment? How does He
travel? What answer is given? What is further said of His apparel?
Isa. 63:1, 2.
    NOTE.—"Edom" means red, and Was the name given to Esau. Gen.
25:30. Bozrah was a city of Edom. The Edomites were the enemies of
Israel. They tried to hinder Israel from entering the Promised Land.
Num. 20:14-21. They were always ready to join the opposers of God's
people. Eze. 25:12. They seemed to have the same spirit as Esau when
lie sought to slay his brother. Gen. 27.:41.
    Esau and Jacob were not only brothers, but twin brothers. This
relationship should have caused them to draw close together; but, in-
stead of this, Edom hated Jacob with a "perpetual hatred." Eze. 35:5.
This scripture applies to all who partake of the spirit of Esau. These
may be very closely related to Israel, but they are not of Israel. They
may be twin brothers, but this only makes their sin more heinous. And
now judgment is poured out upon the persecutors of Israel. God is
shown in this verse as returning from Edom, having executed ven-
geance.
    2. What does Christ say He has trodden? How does He speak of
the day of vengeance? Verses 3, 4.
    NOTE.—In the Garden of Gethsemane Christ was longing for human
sympathy and help. But no help was near. The disciples were sleeping.
Christ was alone with the powers of darkness. Three times the Master
prayed, and three times His humanity shrank from the last crowning
sacrifice. Then He made the decision and accepted the baptism of
blood. "Having made the decision, He fell dying to the ground from
which He had partially risen. Where now were His disciples, to place
their hands tenderly beneath the head of their fainting Master, and
bathe that brow, marred indeed more than the sons of men? The Sav-
iour trod the wine press alone, and of the people there was none with
Him."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 693.
    When God at last executes vengeance on those that have disobeyed
Him and persecuted the saints, He knows just what He is doing. He
has trod the wine press Himself. He knows what it is to suffer. There
was no one near to comfort Him. And the punishment meted out to the
transgressors, great though it be, does not begin to compare with the
agony He Himself passed through.
                                  [ 30]
   3. Why did God wonder? What brought salvation? How does God
again speak of the punishment of evildoers? Verses 5, 6.
    4. With what words does the prophet now turn from the contem-
plation of punishment? Verse 7.
    NoTE.—The wrath of God has been dwelt on in the preceding sec-
tion, and in contrast with this the prophet now calls attention to God's
loving-kindness, goodness, and mercy. It would be well if we more
often would think of God'   s goodness and how much we have to be
thankful for. "Nothing tends more to promote health of body and of
soul than does a spirit of gratitude and praise. It is a positive duty
to resist melancholy, discontented thoughts and feelings,—as much a
duty as it is to pray. If we are heaven bound, how can we go as a band
of mourners, groaning and complaining all along the way to our Fa-
ther's house?"—"The Ministry of Healing," p. 251.
    5. How does God express His confidence in His children? What did
He become? Verse 8.
    NOTE.—"My people." God identifies Himself with His people as in
the beginning. Ex. 3:7. (See also Hosea 11:1.)
    "Children that will not lie," that can be depended on. The meaning
is, that surely they will be faithful and not fall away. This expresses
God's confidence in His people. Even though God knew from the be-
ginning that some would fail, He deals with His children on the basis
of confidence.
     6. When Israel was afflicted, who also was afflicted? Who saved
them? Because of what did He redeem them? What did God do all the
days of old? Verse 9.
     NOTE.—"Few give thought to the suffering that sin has caused our
Creator. All heaven suffered in Christ's agony; but that suffering did
not begin or end with His manifestation in humanity. The cross is a
revelation to our dull senses of the pain that, from its very inception,
sin has brought to the heart of God. Every departure from the right,
every deed of cruelty, every failure of humanity to reach His ideal,
brings grief to Him. When there came upon Israel the calamities that
 were the sure result of separation from God,—subjugation by their
 enemies, cruelty, and death,—it is said that 'His soul was grieved for
 the misery of Israel.' In all their affliction 1=fe was afflicted; . . . and
 He bare them, and carried them all the days of old.'"—"Education,"
 p. 263.
     7. What did Israel do? Whom did they vex? How did God then
 turn, and what did He do? Verse 10.
     NOTE.—"They rebelled." In the worship of the golden calf, Exodus
32; at Meribah, Numbers 20; at Shittim, Numbers 25; in Samuel's
 time, 1 Sam. 8:5, 19, 20.
     "Their enemy." (See Lam. 2:3-5; Jer. 30:14.)
   8. What did the people then remember? What did they say? What
question is asked concerning the Holy Spirit? Verse 11.
   NOTE.—When the Lord had left Israel because of their sin, they
remembered how God of old had been merciful to Israel in spite of
                                C 311
 their shortcomings, and asked: Whe're is God that brought His people
 through the Red Sea? Where is He that gave them His Holy Spirit?
Jeremiah complains that the people do not remember. Jer. 2 :6.
    "Shepherd." Margin, "shepherds," probably Moses and Aaron, as
in Psalm 77:20.
    9. How did God lead the people? What was divided? How did that
affect God's name? Verse 12.
    NOTE.—It was one of the purposes of the miracles and wonders
wrought in Egypt for the deliverance of Israel that God's name might
be declared throughout the earth.
    10. By what illustration does God show how He leads the people?
Verse 13.
    11. Who caused Israel to rest? 'What is repeated concerning God's
name? Verse 14.
    12. How does the prophet, speaking for Israel, word his prayer for
God's attention and help? Verse 15.
    NOTE.—This verse contains one of the most beautiful prayers in all
Scripture. The prophet remembers what God has done in former days,
how He led Israel and saved them. Can not God do the same now? God
had then helped Israel for His name's sake. His name's honor is at
stake now as much as then.
    13. By what endearing name is God called? What is said of Abra-
ham and Israel? What two names for God are now used? Verse 16.
    NOTE.—"Doubtless," rather, "for," as in American Revised Version.
    "Abraham," "Israel." The Jews were proud of being the children
of Abraham. Some of them trusted in that relationship even more than
they did in God. John 8:39. In this verse the prophet expresses his
supreme confidence in the Lord.
    14. With what does the prophet now charge God? What prayer
does he offer? Verse 17.
    15. By what term are God's people here described? How long had
they been in possession of the Promised Land? What had happened to
the sanctuary? Verse 18.
    NOTE.—"A little while." This was probably written about the year
700 B. C., when Israel had been in the land more than five hundred
years. Yet it should be noted that they had not had possession of it
that long. From the very beginning, the Canaanitish tribes bad dis-
puted Israel's advance, and for a long time God's people held but a
small part of the country. Peaceful possession had hardly been theirs
at any time. Twenty years before this was written, ten of the tribes
had been carried into captivity. In the light of God's promise of an in-
heritance they had possessed the land but a little while.
    16. Into what strange condition had Israel fallen? Verse 19,
A. R. V.
    NOTE.—The word "Thine" is supplied. The American Revised Ver-
sion reads, "We are become as they over whom Thou never barest rule,
as they that were not called by Thy name."
                                 [32]
                             LESSON 11
       A PRAYER FOR THE REVEALING OF
                GOD'S POWER
                          March 16, 1929
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Isaiah 64.
MEMORY VERSE: Isa. 64:4.
                          INTRODUCTION
    This chapter deals with events that took place about 698 B. C. In
721 B. C., the ten tribes of Israel had been taken into captivity, and
colonists had been brought over from Babylon to take the place of the
Israelites who had been deported. That was the end of the northern
kingdom. Judah had escaped at that time, but in 701 B. C. Sennach-
crib, king of Assyria, came westward on a tour of conquest, and Judah
did not escape. Hezekiah stripped the gold from the doors of the
temple and from the pillars to satisfy the Assyrian king. But he was
not satisfied. He overran Judah, captured many towns, and carried
more than 200,000 of Judah's population into captivity. It was in a
crisis such as this that the prayer which constitutes this lesson was
made. And God heard the prayers of His people, and saved them.
    The first part of the prayer expresses the wish that God would come
down and show His power in some mighty way. If He would only
reveal Himself as at Mount Sinai, surely the people would tremble.
We sometimes hear the same thought expressed now, that if God would
only speak from heaven and proclaim that the seventh day is the
Sabbath, all would be convinced and keep it. A paraphrase of Christ's
words would fit here: "They have Moses and the prophets; let them
hear them." "If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they
be persuaded, though God should speak from heaven." Luke 16:29, 31.
                            THE LESSON
              •
    1. What does the prophet now pray that God would do? Isa. 64:1.
    NOTE.—This is a continuation of the prayer begun in the fifteenth
verse of the last chapter.
    "Rend the heavens." God had hil Himself from Israel. They could
not pierce through to His dwelling place. Now they ask God to rend
the heavens, to come down and show Himself. The expression "rend
the heavens" is a very strong one, showing the intense desire of Israel
to have God's presence with them again.
    "The mountains." When God .spoke the Ten Commandments, "the
mountains melted from before the Lord." Judges 5:5. Israel is now
asking for a like manifestation.
    2. What illustration is used? What would this make known? What
effect would God's presence have on the nations? Verse 2.
    NOTE.—When Micah saw the Lord come "forth out of His place,"
the mountains melted and the valleys became as wax. Micah 1:3, 4.
                                  [33 ]
The mountains represent that which is most solid here on earth. When
they melt and flow down, well might men tremble at His presence.
    "Make Thy name known." Israel wanted a demonstration of God's
power. It looked to them as though God had forsaken His people. 0
that God in this critical hour would "rend the heavens"! they prayed.
    "The depths of the earth are the Lord's arsenal, whence were drawn
weapons to be employed in the destruction of the old world. Waters
gushing from the earth united with the waters from heaven to accom-
plish the work of desolation. Since the Flood, fire as well as water has
been God's agent to 'destroy very wicked cities. These judgments are
sent, that those who lightly regard God's law and trample upon His
authority, may be led to tremble before His power, and to confess His
just sovereignty. As men have beheld burning mountains pouring
forth fire and flames, and torrents of melted ore, drying up rivers,
overwhelming populous cities, and everywhere spreading ruin and deso-
lation, the stoutest heart has been filled with terror, and infideTh and
blasphemers have been constrained to acknowledge the infinite power
of God."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 109.
   3. What is God said to have done? Verse 3.
   DTOTE.—"Terrible things." This is one of the phrases used in the
Bible to describe the mighty and wonderful acts of God in connection
with the Exodus. Deut. 10:21; 2 Sam. 7:23; Ps. 106:22.
   4. What has not been seen or perceived from the beginning of the
world? Verse 4.
   NorE.—"The Ministry of Healing," page 425, quotes the American
Revised Version which reads: "Neither hath the eye seen a God besides
Thee, who worketh for him that waiteth for Him." God is the only God
who works for those who wait for Him. All other gods must be carried
about.                    •
    5. Whom does God meet? Why is God wroth? Verse 5.
    NOTE.—The picture brings to mind the Father with outstretched
arms meeting and welcoming the returning son. This meeting refers
not only to the world to come, wonderful as that will be. Right here
and now God will meet every honest soul, and conduct him through the
trials and pitfalls of life to everlasting habitations.
    "We have sinned." This confession i 3 at the basis of all true Chris-
tian progress.
    6. What are we all said to be? What is our righteousness? What
is the experience of all? What have our iniquities done? Verse 6.
    NoTE.—"An unclean thing." (See Isa. 1:6.)
    "Filthy rags." Not merely rags, but filthy rags. Our upright con-
duct, our good deeds done to be seen of men, our respectability, our
correct outward deportment, our culture, refinement, education, our
churchgoing and worship—all these, which in themselves are good and
not to be condemned—merely constitute our own righteousness unless
they are grounded in a deep sense of our unworthiness. Without Christ
these seeming virtues are but as filthy rags.
                                [ 34]
   "Fade as a leaf." This is the effect of sin. As the wind blows away
the dead leaves, so shall those be that do iniquity.
    7. What complaint does the prophet now bring? What has God
done? Why? Verse 7.
    NomE.—"None that calleth upon Thy name, that stirreth up him-
self." This statement we may well apply to this time as well as to the
time of Isaiah. It seems that every time God wants something done, it
is necessary to send some one to stir up the people. Men are sleeping
on the brink of eternity, and are not stirred by the events taking place
right before them. And even God's people do not seem to be stirred
as they should be.
    "Hast consumed us." An expression which indicates not what had
happened, but what would happen if they continued in sin.
    8. What is God to His people? What are we? What is God? Whose
work are we? Verse 8. (See also Isa. 29 : 16.)
    9. What do the people ask the Lord not to remember? Verse 9;
43:25.
    10. What have their holy cities and Jerusalem become? Isa. 64:10.
    11. What is said of their holy and beautiful house, the temple?
 Verse 11.
    12. What questions are now asked? Verse 12.
    NOTE.—Will the Lord hold back any longer? The question demands
 the answer that the Lord will not delay any longer, that He will hear
 and help His people.



                            LESSON 12
  A PEOPLE PREPARED FOR A NEW HEAVEN
            AND A NEW EARTH
                           March 23, 1929
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Isaiah 65.
MEMORY VERSE: Isa. 65:17, 18.

                           INTRODUCTION
    Israel provoked God to anger by their "holier than thou" attitude.
It was this same tendency that Christ so abhorred in the Pharisee. This
chapter brings to view the rejection of the Jews and the acceptance of
the Gentiles. Yet God will not reject all Israel. There is still a "seed
in Jacob," that will be saved. For all who are eventually saved, God
will create new heavens and a new earth. There all will be happiness
and joy, no weeping or crying. Even the animal creation shall be at
peace.
                                  [ 35 ]
                             THE LESSON
    1. Of whom has God been sought and found? What did He say to
them? Isa. 65:1.
    NOTE.—Paul, in Romans 10 :20, applies this verse to the calling of
the Gentiles.
    "Behold Me." To behold God is to see His character, His love. To
be convinced of God's goodness, all anyone needs is to behold Him.
    2. To whom does Paul apply Isaiah 65:2? Romans 10:21.
    NOTE.—Paul applies Isaiah 65:1 to the Gentiles, and verse 2 to
the Jews.
    3. What does God say Israel had done? Isa. 65:3.
    4. Where do some remain and lodge? What do they eat, and have in
their vessels? Verse 4.
    Nom—"Among the graves," the rock tombs of Palestine.
    "Monuments," "secret places," American Revised Version. Probably
for purposes of divination.
    "Swine's flesh," forbidden by God. Deut. 14:8.
    5. How did these Jews look upon themselves? How did God con-
sider them? Verse 5.
    6. What is written before God? What will God measure into their
bosom? Verses 6, 7.
    7. What illustration is used by the Lord to show that a seed of Jacob
shall be saved? Verses 8-10.
    Nom—Israel may sin and do wickedly, but God will "not destroy
them all." There is still a "seed" left; they shall inherit "My moun-
tains," for they "have sought Me."
    The Valley of Achor is a place for "herds to lie down in, for My
people that have sought Me." (See Joshua 7:22-26.) The Valley of
Achor means "the valley of troubling;" but later, the Lord, in His good-
ness toward Israel, says He will give us the Valley of Achor for a door
of hope. Hosea 2:15. He lifts us out of our troubles, and this text to
Israel makes it a place of peace and restfulness.
     8. What will happen to those that forget the "holy mountain," that
is, forget God? Verses 11-15.
     NOTE.—Prepare a table for Gad and Meni. (See verse 11, margin.)
These were Syrian gods. The Jews forgot the holy mountain, Jerusalem
with its worship, and turned to strange gods. Therefore, God would
punish them, "number you to the sword." The following verses describe
the punishment. They shall hunger and thirst, they shall be ashamed
and cry for sorrow of heart, and their very name shall be a curse.
    9. How shall'a man bless himself? How shall he swear? What will
be forgotten? What will God create? Verses 16, 17.
    10. In what are we told to rejoice? What shall not be heard any
more? Verses 18, 19.
                                   36
   11. What shall no more be? When shall the child and the sinner die?
Verse 20.
    12. What will those do who build houses? Who will eat the fruit of
the vineyards? Verse 21.
     NOTE.—"In the earth made new, the redeemed will engage in the
occupations and pleasures that brought happiness to Adam and Eve in
the beginning. The Eden life will be lived, the life in garden and field."
—"Prophets and Kings," p. 730.
    13: What will not happen to those who build or plant? What will
their days be like? What will they long enjoy? Verse 22.
     NorE.—"Days of a tree." The tree is the longest-lived living thing
known. Hence the prophet uses that to illustrate long life.
    "There every power will be developed, every capability increased.
The grandest enterprises will be carried forward, the loftiest aspirations
will be reached, the highest ambitions realized. And still there will
appear new heights to surmount, new wonders to admire, new truths to
comprehend, fresh objects of study to call forth the powers of body
and mind and soul."—Id., p. 731.
     14. What are .the saved called? Who is with them? Verse 23.
     15. How quickly will God answer? Verse 24.
     16. What will be the conditions in the new earth? Verse 25.
     NoTE.—"To us who are standing on the very verge of their fulfill-
ment, of what deep moment, what living interest, are these delineations
 of the things to come,—events for which, since our first parents turned
their steps from Eden, God's children have watched and waited, longed
and prayed!
     "Fellow pilgrim, we are still amid the shadows and turmoil of earthly
activities; but soon our Saviour is to appear to bring deliverance and
 rest. Let us by faith behold the blessed hereafter, as pictured by the
hand of God. He who died for the sins of the world, is opening wide the
 gates of Paradise to all who believe on Him. Soon the battle will have
 been fought, the victory won. Soon we shall see Him in whom our hopes
 of eternal life are centered. And in His presence the trials and suffer-
 ings of this life will seem as nothingness. The former things 'shall not
 be remembered, nor come into mind.' "—Id., pp. 731, 732.

                                  [37]
               LESSON 13
  THE INGATHERING FROM THE GENTILES;
       WORSHIP IN THE NEW EARTH
              March 30, 1929
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Isaiah 66.
MEMORY VERSE: Isa. 66:22.
                             INTRODUCTION
    God is more interested in the spirit of the giver than in the value of
the gift. The greatest offering may be an abomination if not accom-
panied by a contrite heart.
    God will do a wonderful work in a short time. When God's people
receive the latter rain, it is for service. Thousands will accept the truth
in a day. It will look as though the work was done suddenly. Yet a long
preparation went before. The seed has been sown and watered. Now it
will suddenly blossom forth and bear fruit. The work will not have been
done in vain. It may now seem as though very little fruit has come from
a large sowing. But God who has brought "to the birth" will also "cause
to bring forth." God's sign will be proclaimed by the remnant in the
whole earth, and men from all nations will be brought as an offering to
the Lord, many of whom will hold responsible positiOns.
    Then will come the new earth. The righteous will worship the Lord,
and the wicked be destroyed.
                              THE LESSON
    1. Where are God's throne and His footstool? What questions are
asked? Isa. 66:1.
    NoTE.—"What manner of house will ye build unto Mel and what
place shall be My rest I" American Revised Version. The contrast be-
tween the first part of the verse and the last is the same as in 1 Kings
8:27 and 2 Chronicles 2:6.
    2. Who has made all things? To whom will God look? Verse 2.
    3. By what four statements does God show that an offering brought
to Him without a contrite spirit is not acceptable? What have they
chosen, and in what do they delight? Verse 3.
    NOTE.—The meaning seems to be, "He that offers an ox or any other
sacrifice to Me, but does not have a contrite heart, is as little pleasing to
Me as a murderer." (See Isa. 1:11.)
    4. 1 V/hat will God choose? Why does He do this? Verse 4.
    NOTE.—The time will conic when God shall send strong delusions.
2 Thess. 2:11. These have chosen their own way (verse 3), and now God
will choose their delusions.
    5. What shall be said to those who tremble at His word? How will
the Lord appear? Verse 5.
    NOTE.—This word was very precious to the brethren who passed
through the experience of 1844. They had been both hated and cast out.
But the precious promise was theirs that the Lord would appear to their
joy. (See "The Great Controversy," p. 372.)
                                   [ 381
     6. How does the prophet express his astonishment? What questions
does he ask? What took place as soon as Zion travailed? Verse 8.
     NOTE.—Verses 6 and 7 form the introduction to the announcement
given in verse 8. The work of the Lord has gone forward so rapidly that
the prophet in astonishment asks if a nation can be born in one day?
This, without doubt, refers to this time, after the events to which verse 5
has reference. God's people have been endued with power from on high,
thousands are converted in a day, and it looks as though a whole nation
were born in a day. This takes place "as soon as Zion travailed," that,
is, as soon as Gods people really become deeply in earnest.'
     7. Who is to rejoice with Jerusalem? Verse 10.
     8. What will God extend to His church? Verse 12.
     9. How will Jerusalem be comforted? When His people see this,
what will they do? What will come to God's enemies? Verses 13, 14.
     10. How will the Lord come? What is said of His anger and rebuke?
With what will the Lord plead? What is said of the slain? Verses 15, 16.
     NOTE.—The slain mentioned in this text are the slain in the great
battle of Armageddon, explained in Jeremiah 25:27-33.
     11. Who will be consumed together? What does God know? Verses
17, 18.
     12. What will God set among the nations? Where will God send the
remnant? What will they declare? Verse 19.
     NOTE.—"A sign." Eze. 20:12, 20.
     "Those that escape," the remnant.
     "Unto the nations." The nations here mentioned are representative
of the nations of the earth. That is, the messengers shall go to the ends
 of the earth and declare God's glory.
      13. What will they bring as an offering from all nations? What will
 the Lord take of them? Verses 20, 21.
     NOTE.—This widespread missionary work will bring sheaves from all
 nations brought as an offering to God. Some of them God will use as
 priests and Levites.
      14. How long will the seed and the name remain? Verse 22.
      15. What will come to pass from one new moon to another, and from
 one Sabbath to another? Verse 23.
     Nova.—"The Sabbath was not for Israel merely, but for the world.
 It had been made known to man in Eden, and, like the other precepts of
 the Decalogue, it is of imperishable obligation. Of that law of which
 the fourth commandment forms a part, Christ declares, 'Till heaven and
 earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in nowise pass from the law.' So
 long as the heavens and the earth endure, the Sabbath will continue as
 a sign of the Creator's power. And when Eden shall bloom on earth
 again, God's holy rest day will be honored by all beneath the sun. 'From
 one Sabbath to another' the inhabitants of the glorified new earth shall
 go up `to worship before Me, saith the Lord.' "—"The Desire of Ages,"
 p. 283.

          AN APPEAL
                   I. H. EVANS
0 men of God! These are the last, last hours;
 Before us, all the whitened harvest field,
Unreaped, untouched by sickles such as ours.
 This closing message will a harvest yield,
    If we, His messengers, in zeal proclaim
    The everlasting gospel in His name.
0 men of God! Jesus our Priest awaits
  On high to close His ministry; to take
His crown as King of kings; to ope the gates
  Of heaven to all His ransomed ones; and shake
    The powers of heaven; to wake the sleeping dead;
    Receive His kingdom as its kingly Head.
0 men of God! These are the last, last hours
  Of time. Eternity is drawing near.
A lost world's doom should wake our drowsy powers
  To deeds of valor in His name; and clear
    Our title to a starry crown to wear;
    Enjoy the mansions Jesus will prepare.
0 men of God! These are the last, last hours
   When mercy waits the sinner. Shall we sleep
In ease till all is lost? Or pray for showers
   Of latter rain to fructify and keep
     Our labors strong in spirit, win the lost
     To love our Lord, regarding not the cost?
0 men of God! These are the last, last hours
  When labors count and bring a rich reward.
In yonder lines of danger, heavenly powers
  Unfurl His blood-stained banner, us to guard!
    Who'll follow where the Master leads the way?
    Go, reap in every land, while lasts the day.
