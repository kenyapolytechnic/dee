 ORDER OF YOUR BOOK AND BIBLE HOUSE



                      2
                       Introductory Note
     In these days the book of Genesis, perhaps more than any other book
of the Bible, is disbelieved, distorted, and explained away. Yet Jesus
believed it. He quoted from the second chapter in approval of the mar-
riage relation, and from the sixth and nineteenth chapters to show the
wickedness of the last days; and He referred several times to Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob, thus showing His faith in the record of their lives as
given in a number of other chapters. Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John
all quote from Genesis or make reference to its contents, while the
apostle Paul quotes from each of the first five chapters; in' fact, a por-
tion of nearly every chapter of the book is alluded to by the different
writers of the New Testament as well as by the Saviour Himself. It
would seem that the Bible writers refer more frequently to this book
than to any other in the Bible.
      Genesis is a book of marvelous beginnings,—a book of facts. It re-
cords the beginning of all material things as they came in their perfec-
tion from the hand of God; the beginning of the institutions of marriage
and the Sabbath; the beginning of temptation and of sin in this world,
with all its consequent evils,—lying, hatred, envy, strife, and murder ;
 the beginning of guilt, remorse, shame, excuses; the beginning of pun-
ishment for sin,—sorrow, pain, and death, thorns and thistles; the be-
 ginning of agriculture, hunting, shepherding, metal smelting, brick-
 laying, instrumental music; the beginning of redemption, worship, sacri-
 fice, offering, and prophesying; the beginning of polygamy, city life,
 drunkenness, races, nations; the beginning of calamity, rain, and the
 rainbow promise; the beginning of diversity of languages and of the
 dispersion of peoples. All these things are noted in the first eleven
 chapters of Genesis.
      This book needs no apologies; it is God-breathed, a revelation of
 His wondrous power and love. Because unconsecrated men can not un-
 derstand or comprehend God's way of working, men of faith should not
 stumble nor question; but rather say with a noted writer, Jean Paul,
 "The first leaf of the Mosaic record has more weight than all the folios
  of men of science and philosophy."



                     Lesson 1 -July 6, 1929
                         THE TRUE GOD
 MEMORY VERSE: Jer. 32 :17.
 SEED THOUGHT: "While the Bible should hold the first place, . . . the book
    of nature is next in importance. . . . The whole natural world is designed to
    be an interpreter of the things of God."—"Counsels to Teachers," pp. 185, 186.

                                 THE LESSON
      1. What is the origin and use of all Scripture? 2 Tim. 3:16.
      NorE.—"This book [the Bible] is the voice of God speaking to us.
 . . . Faith must be kept in constant exercise through the diligent, per-
                                    [ 31
severing study of the word."—"Fundamentals of Christian Education,"
p. 433.
    2. What do the Scriptures teach concerning the origin of the earth
and the things therein? Isa. 42:5.
    NOTE.—Dr. G. Campbell Morgan, noted author and preacher, is said
to have once taken his New Testament and blue-penciled every chapter
that had in it a quotation from, or an allusion to, the Old Testament.
When finished, he did not have twenty unmarked chapters, so thoroughly
is the Old Testament interwoven in the New. Were we to take the en-
tire Bible and mark every direct or indirect statement concerning any
part of God's work as Creator of material things, we should be equally
surprised at the result, for at least thirty of the books of the Bible refer
to God's creative work, and some of these make many direct references
to it.
   3. How did the psalmist distinguish between Israel's God and the
gods of the heathen? Ps. 96:4, 5.
   4. With what did Hezekiah accredit the Lord? Isa. 37 : 16.
    5. Whom did the apostle Paul present to the heathen as the only
true God? Acts 17:23, 24.
    NOTE.—"The most effective way to teach the heathen who know not
God, is through His works."—"Counsels to Teachers," p. 186.
    "As the works of God are studied, the Holy Spirit flashes conviction
into the mind."—"Special Testimonies on Education," p. 59.
    When members of the human family "have learned to know God
through His works, a foundation will be laid for the spiritual truths of
the written word, which will elevate and purify their characters."—
Id., p. 60.
   6. How does the Lord Himself regard His creative work? Isa. 45:18.
    7. Besides being a means of identification of the true God, what
other spiritual purpose does the material creation serve? Ps. 19:1; Isa.
40:26.
    NOTE.—"Solomon took an especial interest in natural history, but
his researches were not confined to any one branch of learning. Through
a diligent study of all created things, both animate and inanimate, he
gained a clear conception of the Creator. In the forces of nature, in the
mineral and the animal world, and in every tree and shrub and flower,
he saw a revelation of God's wisdom; and as he sought to learn more and
more, his knowledge of God and his love for Him constantly increased."
—"Prophets and Kings," p. 33.
    "The whole heart of nature seems thirsting to give;" thus should
our hearts go out to others in kindly, sympathetic service.
                           Hands that ope but to receive
                           Empty close ; they only live
                           Richly who can richly give.
                                               —J. G. Whittier.
    8. What reason does the Lord give for remembering Him? Isa. 51:
12, 13, first part.
                                   [4]
   9. For what reason do heavenly beings accord Jehovah glory and
honor? Rev. 4:11.
    Nom.—"When 'the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the
host of them,' the Creator and all heavenly beings rejoiced in contem-
plation of the glorious scene. 'The morning stars sang together, and all
the sons of God shouted for joy.' "—"The Desire of Ages," p. 769.
    10. Upon what is our duty to reverence and worship God based?
Ps. 95:6, 7.
    NoTE.—True worship is willing obedience to all of God's require-
ments. Why should we not obey and worship Him in whom "we live,
and move, and have our being"?
   11. What are we admonished to do? Isa. 40:26.
    NOTE.—"The upward look corrects the ever-present tendency,• to•
which all are more or less prone, to absorption in the things of this life.
Duty is no longer regarded as irksome compulsion by the one who lives
with uplifted eye—it is rather his opportunity for voicing the devotion
of the heart."
   12. As we heed the prophet Isaiah's admonition, what spirit will
possess us? Ps. 150:2.
   13. Who were associated with the Father in the work of creation?
Gen. 1:2, last part; John 1:1, 3.
   NoTE.—In no case in the Hebrew in the first chapter of Genesis is
the singular form for the Deity used. In other chapters of the book, the
singular form El, God, occurs; but in this chapter the word "E-lo-him,"
the plural form of El, literally Gods, is used thirty-one times. The
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit were one in the work of creation.
    As the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit worked together at the creation,
so were they each present at the inauguration of the gospel dispensa-
tion, when the Father at the baptism of Jesus audibly introduced His.
Son to the world (Matt. 3:16, 17), and the Holy Spirit in the form of
a dove descended from heaven and rested upon Him. Then, when Jesus
gave the great commission to the disciples just before His ascension, He
said that all down the ages the three, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
 (Matt. 28:19), were to be recognized at every Christian baptism; and
baptism, as a personal experience, is the sign of the new creation, or the:
new birth.
   14. Why were the heavens and the earth created? Rev. 4 11, last.
part.
    NomE.—The Lord finds His pleasure in giving pleasure to those whom
He created. "He has filled earth and air and sky with glimpses of beauty
to tell you of His loving thought for you. The beauty of all created
things is but a gleam from the shining of His glory. If He has lavished
such infinite skill upon the things of nature, for your happiness and
joy, can you doubt that He will give you every needed blessing?"—
"Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing," p. 143.
    "Even the adornments of the earth, as seen in the grass of living
green. the lovely flowers of every hue, and the lofty and varied trees of:
                                   IS ]
the forest, testify to the tender, fatherly care of our God,•arid'to His
desire to make His children happy."—"Healthful Living," p. 285.
    15. How should we express our gratitude to the Lord- for His mar-
velous works? Ps. 105:1, 2; 1 Chron. 16:24.
    NOTE.—What God has done reveals what God is; therefore, we should'
tell to others the story of His acts, and let these speak for Him. As the
heathen visited Solomon to learn of his great wisdom, "he taught them
of God as the Creator of all things, and they returned to their homes
with clearer conceptions of the God of Israel, and of His love, for the
human race. In the works of nature they now beheld an expression of
His love and a revelation of His character; and many were led to wor-
ship Him as their God."—"Prophets and Kings," p. 47.
    16. What key to the treasure house of His word has the Lord given
us? Rom. 1:20.
    NOTE.—"In the natural world, God has placed in the hands of the
children of men the key to unlock the treasure house of His word. The
unseen is illustrated by the seen; divine wisdom, eternal truth, infinite
grace, are understood by the things that God has made."—"Counsels to
Teachers," p. 187.

                Lesson 2 — July 1 3 , 1929
               GOD'S POWER AND LOVE
LESSON SCRIPTURE: 'Gen. 1:1-10.
MEMORY VERSE: Amos 5:8.
SEED THOUGHTS: "The display of God's power is at the same time the revela-
   tion of His heart."—H ugh Macmillan.
   "The sunshine and the rain, that gladden and refresh the earth, the hills and
   seas and plains, all speak to us of the Creator's love."—"Steps to Christ," p. 9.
                              THE LESSON
    1. How did the original matter of the earth come into existence?
When did this creation take place? Gen. 1:1-5; Ex. 20:11.
    NOTE.—"The great Jehovah had laid the foundations of the earth;
He had dressed the whole world in the garb of beauty, and had filled it
with things useful to man, He had created all the wonders of the land
and of the sea. In six days the great work of creation had been accom-
plished."--"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 47.
    Why should men think that a bit of lifeless matter thrown off from
the sun could in time evolve living beings, when there has never been
found anywhere in the present natural order mineral matter developing
of itself into living things? Only living things can convert the dust of
the earth into living tissues; therefore, the first living thing on this
earth must have been created, and who but the Lord can create?
    2. What is the first view given us of the earth? Gen. 1:2, first part.
    3. What further view is given of its early condition? Gen. 2:4, 5.
                                   [6 ]
      NOTE.—"No plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb-of
 the field had yet sprung up." (See American Revised Version, Verse-5.)
      4. With what expression is the work of each creation day prefaced?
 Gen. 1:3, 6, 9, 11, 14, 20, 24, 26.
      5. How is this thought upheld elsewhere in the Scriptures? Ps. 33:
6, 9; Heb. 11:3.
      6. What more appeared at the word of the Lord on the first day?
 Gen. 1:3.
      NOTE.—There is light apart from sun; moon, and -stars. "In the
  manifestation of God to His people, light had ever been a symbol of
  His presence. At the creative. word in the beginning, light had shone'
  out of darkness. Light had been enshrouded in the pillar of cloud-by
  day and the pillar of fire by night, leading the vast armies of Israel.
  Light blazed with awful grandeur about the Lord on Mount Sinai.
  Light rested over the mercy seat in the tabernacle. Light filled the -
  temple of Solomon at its dedication. Light shone on the hills of Bethle-
  hem when the angels brought the message of redemption to the watch-
  ing shepherds."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 464.
      The world is in need of spiritual light. "God is light; and in the
  words, am the light of the world,' Christ declared His oneness with
  God, and His relation to the whole human family. It was He who at
  the beginning had caused 'the light to shine out of darkness.' "—ibid.
      God says to us, as of old, "Let there be light;" therefore, it is our
  duty and privilege, both by example and precept, to let the light shine;
  through us to those in darkness.
       7. What did the Lord ask Job concerning the light? Job 38:24,
  first part.
       NorE.—"If the blue were taken from the sky, the gold from the
  sunshine, the verdure from the leaves, the crimson from the blood, which
  is the life of man, the flush from the cheek, the darkness from the eye,
   the radiance from the hair," and the purple from the pansy, we would
   sense what we owe to God for His creative act in giving light with its
  wonderful rainbow hues,—one of. His best gifts to man.
       8. What was done on the second creation day? What purpose does
   the firmament serve? What name was given it? Gen. 1:6-8.
       NOTE.—The work of the second day might seem small compared with
   that of other days (lid we not consider that all living things are depend-
   ent upon the atmosphere for life; that it transmits sound, diffuses the
   sunlight, so that things not in the direct rays can be seen; that it gives
. to us the beautiful blue of the sky, and the gorgeous sunrise add sunset
   colors ; that it upholds the clouds which give us rain and snow, and pre-
   vents the extremes of heat and cold that would otherwise obtain; be-
   sides serving in numerous other ways. Reference is frequently made in
   the Scriptures to this day's work as an evidence of God's power and
   love.
       9. In what are the waters above the firmament confined? Job 26:8.
       Nomr.—The clouds precipitate annually upon the comparatively
   small territory of the British Isles alone at least sixty-eight cubic miles
                                         7
of water, or more than 340 trillion tons, and yet "the cloud is not rent
under them."
   The sun dissipates the clouds; so the Sun of Righteousness dissi-
pates our clouds of trial and perplexity.
                   "Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take;
                      The clouds ye so much dread
                   Are big with mercy, and shall break
                      In blessings o'er your head."

    10. Whom are we admonished to seek? Amos 5:8.
    NOTE.—The Mississippi River keeps bearing its wide miles of water
to the Gulf, and Niagara keeps thundering age after age, because He
"calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face
of the earth."
    A renowned astronomer estimates that 70,000 years would be re-
quired for the world's population, working energetically night and day,
to lift with buckets out of the ocean as much water as the sun draws up
into the clouds in a single year. How quietly and efficiently the Lord
accomplishes His ends! He is well able to do for us "exceeding abun-
dantly above all that we ask or think." Eph. 3:20.
    11. To what beneficent thought concerning the rain does the Lord
call attention? Job 36:27, 28.
    NOTE.—Even now the rain frequently causes much destruction; but
if the raindrops were large, and the rain always accompanied by much
wind or force, it would tear the leaves, blossoms, and fruit from the
plants; destrq crops, and cause serious damage to animal life. The
Lord sends Has doctrines, His instruction, to us in the same gentle,
thoughtful way as He sends the "small" rain. (See Deut. 32:2.)
    12. How does the Lord who sends the rain evidently expect us to
feel toward Him? Jer. 5:24.
    NOTE.—The rain is a symbol of the free and abundant grace of God,
an invitation from God to allow Him to rain righteousness upon us. It
is an evidence of His justice and mercy. While most men forget His
blessings, God expects from us a grateful response for these mercies.
    13. What did the Lord ask Job concerning the snow? Job 38:22.
    14. What invitation does the Lord, from time to time, renew to us
through the snow? Isa. 1:18.
    15. By what illustration does God inspire confidence in those who
sow the seeds of truth in the hearts of men? Isa. 55:10, 11.
    16. What was the first change wrought on the third day? What
name was given to the dry land? What to the waters as gathered to-
gether? Gen. 1:9, 10.
    NOTE.—The Lord sculptured the earth with mountains, hills, and
plains, interspersed with noble rivers and lovely lakes. He ornamented
and enriched the plains with gold, silver, and precious stones. These
were for the service and pleasure of man, and to direct his affections
                                    8
to the Giver of every good and perfect gift. (See "Patriarchs and
Prophets," p. 108.)
    17. What promise shows the value the Lord places on the precious
stones with which He ornamented the earth? Isa. 54:11, 12.
    Noms.—Wonderful promise! He who suffers the Lord to lay the
stones of his spiritual temple, or character, will have it adorned with
the fair colors of humility, patience, benevolence, temperance, and love,
the greatest of which is love. Love is the gathering up and harmonizing
of all other qualities into that divine beauty which it sheds over the
whole life of the Christian. "It is the genus of which all the Christian
virtues are the species."
    18. How does 'the Lord refer to the mountains in illustrating His
care for His people? Ps. 125:2.
    Nom—Like the mountains, the righteousness of the Lord is a gift
to us; and it is our protection from the evil in the world. Ps. 36:6.
    As the mountains give of their substance and of the water that falls
 upon them to enrich the valleys below, so should we enrich other lives
by giving them of the spiritual and temporal bounties that we receive
from the Father above.
    19. When the Lord sought to convince Job of His power and love,
 to what did He refer? Job 38:8-11.
    20. How does the Lord rebuke those who do not recognize His
 power as revealed in the sea? Jer. 5:21, 22.
    NOTE.—"It is not in. order to produce fright that the Lord reminds
 us of His mighty power that can set bounds for the sea, so that it can
 not pass over in its fiercest tumult. No; it is that we may trust Him.
 Perfect faith and love drive fear away. So the power of God over the
 sea is referred to as evidence of His faithfulness." (See Ps. 89:8, 9.)—
 "The Gospel in Creation," p. 81.


                   Lesson 3—July 20, 1929
                    GOD'S GIFT OF LIFE
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Gen. 1:11-13.
MEMORY VERSE: Jer. 17:7, 8.
SEED THOUGHT: "On everything upon the earth, from the loftiest tree of
   the forest to the lichen that clings to the rock, front the boundless ocean to the
   tiniest shell on the shore, they [God's children] may behold the image and su.
   perscription of God."—Mrs. E. G. White, in "Education," p. 100.

                                  THE LESSON
    1. When the creation was completed, what did the Lord say of the
quality of His work? Gen. 1:31.
    NOTE.—"Good" with God means perfect. This precludes the thought
of evolution.
                                        [ 9]
   "Perfection exists in the least as well as in the greatest of the works
of God. . . . So in the humblest lot true excellence may be found; the
commonest tasks, wrought with loving faithfulness, are beautiful in
God's sight."—"Education," p. 114.
   2. What was the first thing to which life was given? Verse 11.
   NerE.-The basis of life in both plants and animals is in the proto-
plasm, a simple substance which appears quite like the raw white of
egg; tint it has kept its life secret from the wise of all ages, that which
makes it a living thing eluding all efforts at complete analyzation. Pro-
toplasin is as much a mystery in the myriads of one-celled animals and
plants as in the highly organized.
    3. What vital purpose was the earth's living carpet of green to serve
in the economic world? Verse 30.
    Non.—"Pleasant to the eyes" and "good for food,"—beauty and
utility. This seems to have been the underlying purpose of god in His
creative work, and few things more fully display both beauty and use-
fulness than does the grass. "How dull and uninteresting would the
earth be without its soft, bright verdure! . . . Though formed to be
cropped by the beasts of the field, and trodden under the foot of man;
though to-day in the field and to-morrow cast into the oven, there is as
much skill expended in its construction as in the palm tree destined to
last for centuries, and lifting up its head securely above the ravages of
man and beast."--"Bible Teaching in Nature," pp. 52, 55.
    4. How does the psalmist illustrate the frailty of human life? 'What
striking contrast does he draw? Ps. 103:15-17.
   51 *hat   important lesson would the Saviour have us learn from the
grass? Matt. 6:30, 31.
   6. After the grass, what did: the. Lord create? Gen. 1:11. -
    7. What lesson did the Saviour draw from the lilies? Matt. 6:28, 29.
    NOTE.—"On the lily's petals, God has written a message for you,—
written in language that your heart can read only as it unlearns the les-
sons of distrust and selfishness and corroding care. . . . Through the
flowers, God would call our attention to the loveliness of Christlike
character. He who has given such beauty to the blossoms desires far
more that the soul should be clothed with the beauty of the character of
Christ."—"Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing," pp. 143, 144.
    "He has filled earth and air and sky with glimpses of beauty to tell
you of His loving thought for you."—Id., P. 143. Then, as long'as there
is beauty in the world, we have the assurance of God's love.
    8. What lessons should the trees, created on the third day, teach us?
Jer. 17:7, 8.
    NOTE.—The tree, ever reaching upward and outward, is a silent ap-
peal to us to be ever drawing nearer and nearer to God, while at the same
time coming into closer, friendlier contact with the world about. The
evident object of the flat surface, interior construction, habit, and ar-
rangement on the stem of leaves, is that of securing the most light pos-
sible, since they can prosecute their work of food making only in the
                                  [ 101
 light. Then do not the millions of leaves appeal to us to direct every
 act of our lives toward the absorption of the True Light, remembering
 that He has said, "Without Me ye can do nothing"? But with Him we
 can say with the apostle Paul, "I can do all things through Christ which
.strengtheneth me.". With. Him a Bunyan could write a "Pilgrim's Prog-
 ress" in a prison cell on the twisted bits of paper that were used as stop-
 pers for the milk bottles.
      9.. What law did the Lord in the beginning write upon the life of
 every seed? Gen. 1:12. Answer: Each plant yielding seed after its kind.
      Nom.—"I know that, whatsoever. God doeth, it shall be forever."
 Eccl. 3:14. When He said that each seed should reproduce "after his
 kind," that inexorable law went forth for all time. Man can produce
 new varieties of plants by cross fertilization, and hybridization, but no
 new species.
      10. How does the Lord contrast the righteous and the wicked? Ps.
1:1-6. •
      NOTE.—The man whose soul is not watered by the water of life will
  perish as does leaf or tree cut off from its water supply. Hence each
  growing plant is a silent appeal to us to keep in touch with the "living
  fountains of waters." Rev. 7:17. The "leaf fadeth" if the circulation
  of wat.er is not properly maintained, and the leaf has a large part to act
  in securing efficient circulation.

                   GOD'S FAITHFULNESS
 LESSON SCRIPTURE: .Gen. 1:14-19.
 IVIElViOp.'Y VERSE: Ps. 89:1, 2.
 SE.E35. . THOUGHT:
            -            "On every leaf of. the forest or stone of the mountains, in
    .every shining star, M. earth and air and sky, God's name was written."—"Pa-
    . tri'archs and Prophets," p. 51. .       •
                          .         THE LESSON
     1. What was made to appear on the fourth day of creation week?
 What benefit was the earth to receive from the heavenly bodies? Gen.
1:14-16.
     NOTE.—Surely He who commands the morning, and causes the day-
 spring to know its place (Job 38:12) should be trusted to guide and
 direct our paths.        '
     2. Of what does the Lord regard His control over day and night to
 be an assurance? Jer. 33:20, 21, 25, 26.
     NOTE.—Frorn the beginning God has kept His promise with nights
 and days that one should succeed the other. Are not His promises of
 grace as immutable as. His laws in nature?
     3. As the earth is turned to the sun, what effect is produced? Job
38:14.
                                        [ 11]
     NomE.—The sun's rays cause all vegetation to grow green and beau-
tiful, to "stand forth as in rich apparel."—Noyes' Translation.
    "The Lord God is a sun" (Ps. 84:11) to His people. His presenee in
the heart will cause the graces of the Spirit to spring forth even as the
sun causes vegetable life to grow. As a plant invariably grows toward
the light, so would God have it remind us that we should turn as na-
turally to Him for spiritual life.
     4. How is the revolution of the earth about the sun indicated? Gen.
1:14, last part.
    NomE.—How confidently we look forward to one season and then an-
other; but to produce these, the earth with all upon it must compass each
year a journey of 600,000,000 miles, or one and one-half million, miles
a day. For thousands of years it has made this annual revolution about
the sun, and has not lost a second of time. How safe we feel and how
confidently we rest upon that promise made so long ago that "while the
earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer
and winter, and day and night shall not cease"! Gen. 8:22.
    5. Who alone knows the number of the stars? Ps. 147:4.
    NomE.—We can observe with the naked eye only a few thousand
stars, but the telescope and the camera together reveal millions upon
millions. Each star is a sun, and no doubt like our sun is the center of a
great solar system, with planets and their moons revolving around it.
Our system occupies a space of more than five billion miles in diameter.
    6. What did the Lord ask Job when seeking to impress him with
man's impotency as compared with God's omnipotence? Job 38:32.
    NomE.—Arcturus is a giant sun estimated to have a diameter of
86,000,000 miles; and his "sons" are doubtless none other than huge
worlds revolving around him at almost incredibly high speeds. Yet
Arcturus, with his retinue of worlds, is flying through space at the rate
of more than 900,000 miles an hour. Surely only omnipotent power can
guide Arcturus and his "sons" in their terrific speed through the heav-
ens. Our own sun, with his worlds and their satellites, is speeding along
at a rate of sixteen miles a second, or about 60,000 miles an hour.
    7. What other interesting question did the Lord ask Job? Verse 31.
    NOTE.—
                         "Orion, as they sang of old
                            Orion, who can loose thy,hands?
                         What stranger can invade thy fold
                            Or snatch thy jewel from thy hand?"

    8. What do the heavens declare? Ps. 19:1; 89:1, 2.
    NomE.—Are not His power, goodness, and love His glory f Surely
the heavens declare these, together with His faithfulness.
                    Lord of all being, throned afar,
                    Thy glory flames from sun and star,—
                    Center and soul of every sphere,
                    Yet to each loving heart how near !
                                             —0. W. Holmes.
                                    [ 12]
    9. Where does the Lord admonish us to look for evidence of His
power and faithfulness? Isa. 40:26.
    NoTE.—"Not One faileth." Of all the millions of heavenly bodies,
all of which are in constant motion, not one fails to come to its ap-
pointed place at the proper time. The world's timepieces are set and
regulated by the stars; "for that He is strong in power, not one fail-
eth." (See American Revised Version punctuation.) Would that man
were as obedient to the will of God!
    10. Who alone knows the names of all the stars? Ps. 147:4.
    11. What impressed Eliphaz, the friend of Job, as he studied the
stars? Job 22 : 12.
    NoTE.—To help us comprehend even the enormous distance of the
nearest star, an able astronomer gives the following suggestion : Begin
reading Webster's International Dictionary at the time a ray, of light,
which travels 186,000 miles a second, leaves the nearest star. When
you have finished a single page, the light will have compassed 100,000,-
000 miles. When you have read the book through once, the light will
have traveled two hundred billion miles, and yet it has hardly started
on its way. If you keep on reading ceaselessly day and night, you will
have read the dictionary through nearly one hundred times before• that
ray of light reaches the earth, and you will have been reading more than
four years.
    12. What suggestion is given in the word of the infinitude of space?
Jer. 31:37.
    NOTE.—It is said that "the earth is to the space between us and the
nearest star as a particle one twentieth of an inch in diameter is to the
whole world." Since the average distance between the stars is thought
to be nearly three times the distance of the nearest star from us, what
must be the extent of the universe that harbors millions upon millions
of stars! How comforting the thought that the Lord's heart of love is
as great as His power. Were this not so, there would not be such mar-
 velous exhibitions of tender care for His children as the word and ex-
perience reveal.
    13. How long will the stars give forth light? Dan. 12:3.
    14. How does the Lord illustrate the great difference between His
thoughts and those of man? Isa. 55:9.
    NoTr..—"God sent His only-begotten Son to ransom man; man of-
fered thirty pieces of silver for Him."—D. L. Moody.
    The Lord says of man: "Of the Rock that begat thee thou art un-
mindful, and hast forgotten God that formed thee." Deut. 32:18. But
 the Lord says of Himself that a woman may forget her own child, yet
 He will not forget us. He has graven us upon the palms of His hands.
 (See Isa. 49:15, 16.)
    While to the astronomer the earth is but a grain of sand ;'to heavenly
intelligences it is "the lesson book of the universe." It is here that "the
Son of God tabernacled in humanity;" it is here that "the King of glory
 lived and suffered and died;" it is here that "the tabernacle of God"
shall be "with men" when all things are made new.

                 Lesson 5—August 3, 1929
 GOD'S WONDROUS WISDOM AND CARE
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Gen. 1:20-25, 30.
MEMORY VERSE: Job 12:7, 8.
SEED THOUGHT: "All the creatures of the woods and hills are a part of. His
   great household. He opens His hand, and satisfies the desire of every living
   thing."—"Education," p. 118.
                               THE LESSON
     1. What two divisions of animal life were created on the fifth day?
 Gen: 1:20, 21.
     NOTE.—A marvelous work to be described in sixty-three WOrds. Men
 have devoted a lifetime to studying one or more kinds of water animals,
 while others have devoted their lives to the study of birds. EVen then
 their works were far from complete.
     2: What did God say concerning the multiplication of water ani-
 mals? Verse 22.
     3. 'What was created upon the sixth day? Verse 24.
     4. What phrase expresses the law according to which living things
 were to he multiplied? Verse 25.        •
     NOTE.—The phrase "after his kind" occurs ten times in five verses
 referring• to the creation of plants and animals. That phrase precludes
 chance, spontaneous generation, and evolution. Certain definite genera,
-or, kinds, were in, the• thought of the Creator, and when He spoke, the
 organism came into being that answered to His thought or design. Each
 wag to reproduce after its kind. Order, mathematical precision, intelli-
 gent design, are revealed throughout all nature. Surely, there is no folly'
 like that which- would make the earth and the things therein create
 themselves independently of the Lord of hosts; there is ,n0- blasphemy
 like that which would rob the Lord of hosts of His place as Creator of
 heaven and earth.              .
     Louis Pasteur, the well-known French scientist, made•this interest-
 ing observation: "Posterity will one day laugh at the 'foolishness of
 the modern materialistic philosopher. The more I study nature, the:more
 I stand amazed at the works of the Creator. I pray while I am engaged
 in my work at the laboratory."
     S. What food did the Lord provide for animals? Verse 30.
     6. What other provision did He make for their need? Ps.-104:10-12.
     7. What care does God still maintain over the animals? Job 38:
39-41; Ps. 104:27.
     NOTE.—"It is through His power that vegetation flourishes,- that the
 leaves appear and the flowers bloom. He 'maketh grass to grow upon
 the mountains,' and by Him the valleys are made fruitful. All the beasts
 of the forest seek their meat from God, and every living creature, from
                                   [14 ]
the smallest insect up to man, is daily dependent upon His providential
care."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 115.                                  •
    Knowing God's care for all His creatures, why should not man say,
"God is inconceivably great, unsearchingly wise, infinitely just and true;
I am in His hands, and all is well."
   8. What power has been given the animals? Prov. 6:6-8.
   9. How does the Lord express His care for us? Matt. 10:29, 31.
   NOTE.—"The Father's presence encircled Christ, and nothing befell
Him but that which Infinite Love permitted for the blessing of the
world. Here was His source of comfort, and it is for us."--"Thoughts
from the Mount of Blessing," p. 110.
   10. To what does the Lord liken those who are unmindful of Him
and His care? Job 8:11-13.
   NOTE.—The rush and the flag grow luxuriantly so long as their
water supply is ample, but if deprived of it, quickly perish; so do all
who forget God. They have no living principle of enduring prosperity
within themselves, either in the love of God within them, or of the
blessing of God on them. "To forget God is robbery, ingratitude, and
idolatry." The Lord has made it easy for us to remember Him if we
will only do as He asks us, associate everything about us with some re-
vealed or unrevealed message to us of His love, care, and power; and
accustom ourselves to recall these messages as we are brought in con-
tact with the various things. In this way are we led to "pray without
ceasing," for prayer consists of thankgiving as well as solicitation.
    11. What promise is given to those who wait upon the Lord? Isa.
40:29, 31.
    NoTE.—"Never allow yourself to talk in a hopeless, discouraged way.
If you do, you will lose much. By.looking at appearances, and complain-
ing when difficulties and pressure come, you give evidence of a sickly,
enfeebled faith. Talk and act as if your faith was invincible. The Lord
is rich in resources; He owns the world. Look heavenward in faith.
Look to Him who has light and power and efficiency. There is in genuine
faith a buoyancy, a steadfastness of principle, and a fixedness of pur-
pose, that neither time nor toil can weaken."—"Christ's Object Les-
sons," p. 147.
    12. By what illustration did the Saviour emphasize His deep solici-
tude for His children? Matt. 23:37.
    NoTE.—"Christ saw in Jerusalem a symbol of the world hardened
in unbelief and rebellion, and hastening on to meet the retributive judg-
ments of God. The woes of a fallen race, pressing upon His soul, forced
from His lips that exceeding bitter cry [John 5:40]. He saw the record
of sin traced in human misery, tears, and blood; His heart was moved
with infinite pity for the afflicted and suffering ones of earth; He
yearned to relieve them all. . . . The Majesty of heaven in tears [Luke
19:41] ! the Son of the infinite God troubled in spirit, bowed down with
 anguish! The scene filled all heaven with wonder. That scene reveals
 to us the exceeding sinfulness of sin; it shows how hard a task it is,
                                   [157
 even for infinite power, to save the guilty from the consequences of
'transgressing the law of God. Jesus, looking down to the last genera-
 tion, saw the world involved in a deception similar to that which caused
 the destruction of Jerusalem."—"The Great Controversy," p. 22.
   13. What questions did the Lord ask Job in an effort to lead Him to
sense his true relation to God? Job 39:13, 19, 26, 27.
    NoTE.—So skillful is the hawk in its flying that it can sail the length
of the Holy Land many times in a day. No doubt the wonderful migra-
tion instinct is referred to in the last part of verse 26, an instinct that
baffles man to explain or even to comprehend. So delicately adjusted
is the bird's flying apparatus that if the primary feathers are lost
from the tip of one wing, the power of flight is seriously crippled.
Surely, it is not by man's wisdom, nor by evolution, that the bird is able
to fly, but by the power of Him who in the spiritual world can teach
us to soar to heavenly heights, leaving below us everything mean and
low, every unkindness, with every unlovely thought or deed.
    14. What reference does Solomon make to the God-given instinct
revealed by animals? Prov. 30:24-28.
    15. What lesson does the Lord draw from this same God-given in-
stinct? Isa. 1:3; Jer. 8:7.
    16. How did the psalmist express his longing for God? Ps. 42:1.
    NoTE.—"All the way up the steep road leading to eternal life are
wellsprings of joy to refresh the weary. Those who walk in wisdom's
ways, are, even in tribulation, exceeding joyful; for He whom their
soul loveth, walks, invisible, beside them. At each upward step they
discern more distinctly the touch of His hand; at every step brighter
gleamings of glory from the Unseen fall upon their path; and their
songs of praise, reaching ever a higher note, ascend to join the songs
of angels before the throne."—"Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing,"
p. 202.


               Lesson 6—August 10, 1929
             GOD'S CROWNING WORK
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Gen. 1:26-29, 31; 2:7, 19-24.
MEMORY VERSE: Ps. 100:3.
SEED THOUGHT: "He who gave His image to us must of necessity like to see
   His image in us."—D. L. Moody.

                             THE LESSON
   1. What was the Lord's objective in creating the earth with its plant
and animal life? Isa. 45:18.
   Non.—"After the earth with its teeming animal and vegetable life,
had been called into existence, man, the crowning work of the Creator,
and the one for whom the beautiful earth had been fitted up, was brought
upon the stage of action."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 44.
                                 t 16 1
   2. What wonderful conception did the Lord have for man before
creating him? Gen. 1:26.
   Nom—God says that He created man in His image, according to a
preconceived purpose. There are more than threescore statements in
the Bible to the effect that the Lord created man.
   3. When the creative fiat went forth, what was the result? Verse 27.
    NoTE.—No greater love, no higher honor, can be conceived than
what God bestowed upon man in creating him in His own image. "Shall
we, for the privilege of tracing our descent from germs and mollusks
and apes, consent to cast away that statement of Holy Writ, so grand
in its simplicity, 'God created man in His own image, in the image of
God created He him'? Shall we reject that genealogical record,—
prouder than any treasured in the courts of kings,—'which was the son
of Adam, which was the son of God'?"—"Education," p. 130.
    Nobility means obligation. "Our noble birth is a divine commission
which should bar all ignoble living."
    4. Out of what was man formed? Gen. 2:7.
    5. In creating Eve as He did, what truths concerning the marriage
relation did the Lord seek to impress? Verses 21-24.
    NoTE.—"God celebrated the first marriage. Thus the institution has
for its originator the Creator of the universe. 'Marriage is honorable
[Heb. 13:4] ;' it was one of the first gifts of God to man, and it is one
of th two institutions that, after the fall, Adam brought with him be-
yond -the gates of Paradise. When the divine principles are recognized
and obeyed in this relation, marriage is a blessing; it guards the purity
and happiness of the race, it provides for man's social needs, it elevates
the physical, the intellectual, and the moral nature."—"Patriarchs and
Prophets," p. 46.
   6. What does the first recorded task performed by Adam reveal con-
cerning his native intelligence? Verse 19,
   7. What conception did the psalmist have of man as he came from
the hand of the Creator? Ps. 8:5.
    NorE.—"They [Adam and Eve] were full of the vigor imparted by
the tree of life, and their intellectual power was but little less than that
of the angels. The mysteries of the visible universe—`the wondrous
works of Him who is perfect in knowledge'—afforded them an exhaust-
less source of instruction and delight. The laws and operations of na-
ture, which have engaged man's study for six thousand years, were
opened to their minds by the infinite Framer and Upholder of all. They
held converse with leaf and flower and tree, gathering from each the
secrets of its life. With every living creature, from the mighty levia-
than that playeth among the waters, to the insect mote that floats in
the sunbeam, Adam was familiar. He had given to each its name, and
he was acquainted with the nature and habits of all. God's glory in the
heavens, the innumerable worlds in their orderly revolutions, 'the bal-
ancings of the clouds,' the mysteries of light and sound, of day and
night,—all were open to the study of our first parents. On every leaf
                                   E 17]
of the forest or stone of the mountains, in every shining star, in earth
and air and sky, God's name was written. The order and harmony of
creation spoke to them of infinite wisdom and power. They were ever
discovering some attraction that filled their hearts with deeper love,
and called forth fresh expressions of gratitude."—Id., pp. 50, 51.
   8. What food was provided for man? Gen. 1:29.
   NOTE.—"Grains, fruits, nuts, and vegetables constitute the diet
chosen for us by our Creator. These foods, prepared in as simple and
natural a manner as possible, are the most healthful and nourishing."
—"The Ministry of Healing," •p. 296.
   Man was first granted permission to eat animal food after the Flood.
Gen. 9:3.
    9. What arrangement did the Lord make for a home for Adam and
Eve? Gen. 2:8.
    NOTE.—The first home—"flower-strewn and star-curtained"—was
designed and decorated by the Master Designer, the Lord Himself.
"The blue heavens were its dome; the earth, with its delicate flowers
and carpet of living green, was its floor; and the leafy branches of the
goodly trees were its canopy. Its walls were hung with the most mag-
nificent adornings,—the handiwork of the great Master Artist. In the
surroundings of the holy pair was a lesson for all time,—that true hap-
piness is found, not in the indulgence of pride and luxury, but in com-
munion with God through His created works."—"Patriarchs and
Prophets," p. 49.
    10. What responsibility accompanied the gift of the Garan of
Eden? Verse 15.
    NoTE.—"It was the work of Adam and Eve to train the branches of
the vine to form bowers, thus making for themselves a dwelling, from
living trees covered with foliage and fruit. There were fragrant flowers
of every hue in rick profusion."—Id., p. 47.
   11. What authority was given man? Gen. 1:28, last part.
   NOTE.—Man "was placed, as God's representative, over the lower
orders of being. They can not understand or acknowledge the sover-
eignty of God, yet they were made capable of loving and serving man."
—Id., p. 45.
    12. How does the Lord still declare His ownership of all things?
Ps. 50:10-12.
    NOTE.—"By the terms of our stewardship we are placed under ob-
ligation, not only to God, but to man. To the infinite love of the Re-
deemer every human being is indebted for the gifts of life. Food and
raiment and shelter, body and mind and soul,—all are the purchase of
His blood. And by the obligation of gratitude and service thus imposed,
Christ has bound us to our fellow men."—"Education," p. 139.
   13. What was now true of the work of creation? Gen. 2:1; Heb. 4:3.
   14. As the Lord reviewed His work, what could He say of it? Gen.
1:31.
                                 [18]
    NOTE.—"Very good"—beautiful - in its perfection. Solomon: said, -
God "hath made everything beautiful in His time." Bed. 3 :11. "Beauty
is essentially inwrought into God's works; every little flower, every
blade of grass, every fitful shape, every flagrant twig, exemplifies it.
Beauty is God's taste, God's art, God's manner of workmanship. Beauty
is the necessary conception of •the Creator's thought, the necessary
product of His hand; variety in beauty is the necessary expression of
His infinite mind."—"The Expositor's Dictionary of. Texts," p. 538.
    15. What is God's present relationship to the universe? Neh. 9:6.
    NOTE.—"As regards this earth, Scripture declares the work of crea-
tion to have been completed. 'The works were finished from the founda-
tion of the world.' But the power of God is still exercised in upholding
the objects of His creation. It is not because the mechanism once set:
in motion continues to act by its own inherent energy that the pulse
beats, and breath follows breath. Every breath, every pulsation of the
heart, is an evidence of the care of Him in whom we live and move and
have our being. From the smallest insect to man, every living creature
is daily dependent upon His providence."—"Education," pp. 130, 131.
    16. What part does the Saviour have in the continuance of the pres-
ent order? Heb. 1:3.
    NOTE.—"The hand that sustains the worlds in space, the hand that
holds in their orderly arrangement and tireless activity all things
throughout the universe of God, is the hand that was nailed to the cross
for us."—Id., p. 132.
    17: What should we ever bear in mind? Ps. 100:3; Isa. 43:7.


                Lesson 7—August 17, 1929
                   GOD'S MEMORIAL
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Gen. 2:1-3; Ex. 20:8-11.
MEMORY VERSE: Isa. 58:13, 14.
SEED THOUGHT: "When the foundations of the earth were laid, when the
   morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy, then was
   laid the foundation' of the Sabbath. Well may this institution demand our
   reverence: it was ordained by no human authority, and rests upon no human
   traditions; it was established by the Ancient of Days, and commanded by His
   eternal word."—"The Great Controversy," p. 455.
                                THE LESSON
   1. How, long a time was devoted to the creative work? Ex. 31:17.
   2. What shows that these were six literal days? Gen. 1:5, 8, 13, 19,
23, 31.
    NoTE.—Prof. Marcus Dods, a• noted Scottish divine and author,
says, "If, for example, the word day in these chapters [Gen. 1 and 2]
does not mean a period of twenty-four hours, the interpretation of Scrip-
tures is hopeless."—"Genesis," p. 4.
                                      [19 ]
      "Rationalism may twist Scripture into any meanings it pleases if it
  may put a geologist's meaning into this word day. It is defined by morn-
  ing and evening which can only by unwarranted straining be referred
, to a long period. Its meaning is also fixed by verse 16."—Ibid.
      3. After completing the work of creation, what did the Lord do?
  Gen. 2:1, 2.
      4. After resting on the seventh day, what did He do? Verse 3.
      Noma.—It was the seventh day and not the Sabbath institution that
  God blessed and sanctified.
      Prof. George Bush, in his "Notes on Genesis," says: "God's sancti-
  fying the day is equivalent to His commanding men to sanctify it. As
  at the close of creation the seventh day was then set apart by the Most
  High for such purpose, without limitation to age or country, the observ-
  ance of it is obligatory upon the whole human race. . . . The sanctifi-
  cation of the seventh day in the present case can only be understood of
 its being set apart to the special worship and service of God."—"Notes
  on Genesis," Vol. 1, pp. 47, 49.
      5. Which seventh day did God bless and sanctify? Gen. 2:3.
      NomE.—God blessed and sanctified the seventh day on which He had
  just rested. The acts of blessing and sanctifying involve the idea of a
  future use of those things which are blessed and sanctified.
      6. Why did the Lord institute the Sabbath? Ex. 20:11.
      NomE.—The Sabbath is the world's first memorial. It was given to
  commemorate the great creative work of the Lord. What a privilege
  to celebrate from week to week such a wonderful exhibition of power,
 wisdom, and love! The Lord instituted the Passover as a memorial of
  the deliverance of the children of Israel from Egypt. Ex. 12:14. At the
  command of the Lord twelve stones were set up after the crossing of
 Jordan to commemorate the parting of the waters as the Israelites
 passed over. Joshua 4:7. Baptism is a memorial, commemorating the
 burial and resurrection of the Saviour, while the bread and wine com-
 memorate Hig broken body and spilled blood. Since these were all es-
 tablished by the Lord Himself, it would seem strange if He had not
 left a memorial of His creative work; but He has done so. David said:
 "He hath made His wonderful works to be remembered." Ps. 111:4.
    7. How long will God's memorial endure? Ps. 135:13.
    NomE.—The Sabbath, which is the memorial of God's creative power,
will never cease to exist. When this sinful state of things shall give way
to the sinless new earth, the fact upon which the Sabbath institution is
based will still remain; and those who shall be permitted to live in the
new earth will still commemorate the creative power of God, while sing-
ing the song of Moses and the Lamb.
    8. Of what was this memorial to be a sign? Eze. 20:20.
    NomE.—"Pointing to God as the Maker of the heavens and the earth,
it distinguishes the true God from all false gods. All who keep the
seventh day, signify by this act that they are worshipers of Jehovah.
Thus the Sabbath is the sign of man's allegiance to God as long as there
                                  [20 ]
are any upon the earth to serve Him. The fourth commandment is the
only one of all the ten in which are found both the name and the title
of the Lawgiver. It is the only one that shows by whose authority the
law is given. Thus it contains the seal of God, affixed to His law as evi-
dence of its authenticity and binding force."—"Patriarchs and Proph-
ets," p. 307.
   9. What further purpose was the Sabbath to serve? Ex. 31:13.
    NOTE.—" 'Look unto Me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth;
for I am God, and there is none else.' [Isa. 45:22.] This is the message
written in nature, which the Sabbath is appointed to keep in memory."
—"The Desire of Ages," p. 283.
   10. How long, is the Sabbath to be a sign between God and His peo-
ple? Ex. 31:17, first part; Isa. 66:23.
    NOTE.—The Sabbath commemorates both creation and redemption,
so when the work of redemption was finished, Jesus rested and lay •in
Joseph's tomb, over the Sabbath, even as He had rested when the crea-
tive work was completed. Read "The Desire of Ages," page 749.
   11. If we really sense the greatness of the work of creation, which
the Sabbath commemorates, what spirit will possess us? Ps. 92 : 1-5.
   12. What relation did the Saviour say that He bore to the Sabbath?
Luke 6:5.
   NomE.—Christ being the active agent in creation, must have rested
on the seventh day with the Father. It is, therefore, His rest day as
well as that of the Father.
    13. How should the Sabbath be kept? Ex. 20:8-10.
     NOTE.—"God's love has set a limit to the demands of toil. Over the
Sabbath He places His merciful hand. In His own day He preserves
for the family opportunity for communion with Him, with nature, and
with one another. Since the Sabbath is the memorial of creative power,
it is the day above all others when we should acquaint ourselves with
God through His works. In the minds of the children the very thought
of the Sabbath should be bound up with the beauty of natural things.
Happy is the family who can go to the place of worship on the Sabbath
as Jesus and His disciples went to the synagogue,—across the fields,
along the shores of the lake, or through the groves. Happy the father
and mother who can teach their children God's written word with illus-
trations from the open pages of the book of nature; who can gather
under the green trees, in the fresh, pure air, to study the word and to
sing the praise of the Father above. By such associations parents may
bind their children to their hearts, and thus to God, by ties that can
never be broken."—"Education," p. 251.
    14. Why have people forgotten the Lord? Deut. 8:11.
    NomE.—If the object of the Sabbath was to keep God as the Creator
in mind, aid if it had been faithfully kept from the beginning, there
would not now be a heathen or an idolater on the face of the earth. When
we remember that two thirds of the world's inhabitants to-day are idola-
ters, and that since the fall, idolatry, with its train of associated and re-
                                    E 21 I
sultant evils, has ever been a prevailing sin, and then think that the ob-
servance of. the .Sabbath, as God ordained it, would have prevented all
this, we can .better, appreciate the value of the .Sabbath institution, and
the importance of Sabbath keeping.
    15. In what effective way did the Lord teach the children of Israel
which day was the Sabbath? Ex. 16:19-30.
     NOTE.—To Israel, wandering in the wilde.rness more than twenty-
five hundred years after creation, the Lord gave three distinct miracles
 (a double portion of manna fell on the sixth day, none on the seventh,
and the portion reserved for the Sabbath was kept from spoiling) each
week of the forty years—more than six thousand in all—to identify the
day, the Sabbath of creation. Thus the Leader of Israel, Jesus Christ
Himself (1 Cor. 10:4), pointed out 2,080 identical seventh days and
labeled them the Sabbath day. Through all the years since, the seventh
day thus pointed out has been observed as the Sabbath. Never has the
Lord, either before or after this experience, made such effort to,leave
men without excuse as to His will; and yet in this day of ours, men fre- -
quently say, "The original seventh day can not be identified. It has been
lost." It has been lost only out of men's hearts.
    16. What indicates that the Lord designed the Sabbath to be a day
for public worship? Lev. 23:3; Heb. 10:24, 25.
    NOTE.—"The little companies assembled to worship God on His holy
day, have a right to claim the rich blessing of Jehovah. They should
believe that the Lord Jesus is an honored guest in their assemblies."—
"Testimonies," Vol. 6, pp. 360, 361.



               Lesson 8—August 24, 1929
                   THE GREAT DEFEAT
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Genesis 3.
MEMORY VERSE: 1 John 2:16.
SEED THOUGHT: "With his own evil characteristics he [Satan] sought to
   invest the loving CreatOr. Thus he deceived angels. Thus'he deceived men.
   He led them to doubt the word of God, and to distrust His goodness. Because
   God -is a God of justice and terrible majesty, Satan caused them to look upon
   Him as severe and unforgiving. Thus he drew men to join him in rebellion
   against God, and the night of woe settled down upon the world."—"The Desire
   of Ages," p. 22.
                               THE LESSON
    1. What generous permission did the Lord give Adam as He es-
tablished. him, in his new home? What simple prohibition was made?
What penalty .was attached to the violation of this prohibition? Gen.
2:16, 17..
    2. Who early interested himself in the new world and its Eden home?
Gen. 3:1, first part; Rev. 12:9.
                                     [ 22 ]
    3. Sketch briefly the character of this uninvited visitor to the Gar-
den of Eden. Eze. 28:14, 15, 17; John 8:44.
    NomE.—"Though all his glory was from God, this mighty angel came
to regard it as pertaining to himself. Not content with his position,
though honored above the heavenly host, he ventured to covet homage
due alone to the Creator. Instead of seeking to make God supreme in'the
affections and allegiance of all created beings, it was his endeavor to
secure their service and.loyalty to himself. And coveting the glory with
which the infinite Father had invested His Son, this prince of angels,
aspired to power that was the prerogative'of Christ alone."—"Patriarchs
and Prophets," p. 35.
    4. What action was finally taken against Lucifer and his followers?
What spirit did Lucifer manifest? Rev. 12:9.
    NOTE.—"No longer free to stir up rebellion in heaven, Satan's en-
mity against God found a new field in plotting the ruin of the human
race. In the happiness and peace of the holy pair in Eden, he beheld a
vision of the bliss that to him was forever lost' Moved by envy, he de-
termined to incite them to disobedience, and bring upon them the guilt
and penalty of sin. He would change their love to distrust, and their
songs of praise to reproaches against their Maker. Thus he would not
only plunge these innocent beings into the same misery which he was
himself enduring, but would cast dishonor upon God, and cause grief
in heaven."—Id. p. 52.
    5. Though the Lord's love had been so manifest to Adam and Eve,
what further expression of solicitude did He give them?
    NOTE.—"The angels warned them to be on their guard against the
devices of Satan ; for his efforts to ensnare them would be unwearied.
While they were obedient to God, the evil one could not harm them;
for, if need be, every angel in heaven would be sent to their help. . . .
The angels had cautioned Eve to beware of separating herself from her
husband while occupied in their daily labor in the garden; with him
she would be in less danger from temptation than if she were alone."—
Id., p. 53.
   6. What disguise did Satan use in tempting Eve? What ensnaring
question did he put to Eve? Gen. 3:1.
   NOTE.—"To parley with temptation is to play with fire."—Bunya.n.
    7. What was Eve's reply? What bold contradiction did Satan make
to the Lord's words? Verses 2-4.
    8. What deceptive picture did he present as the reward of eating of
the forbidden fruit? What false motive did he attribute to God in the
prohibition? Verse 5.
    NOTE.—"By partaking of this tree, he [Satan] declared, they would
attain to a more exalted sphere of existence, and enter a broader field
of knowledge. He himself had eaten of the forbidden fruit, and as a
result had acquired the power of speech. And he insinuated that the
Lord jealously desired to withhold it from them, lest they should be
exalted to equality with Himself. It was because of its wonderful prop-
                                 123 ]
erties, imparting wisdom and power, that He had prohibited them from
tasting or even touching it. The tempter intimated that the divine warn-
ing was not to be actually fulfilled; it was designed merely to intimidate
them. How could it be possible for them to die/ Had they not eaten of
the tree of life/ God had been seeking to prevent them from reaching
a nobler development, and finding greater happiness."—"Patriarchs and
Prophets," p. 54.
    9. What shows that Eve had completely surrendered herself to the
deception of the enemy? When the tempter finally plucked the,fruit and
offered it to Eve, what did she do? Verse 6.
    NOTE.--Satan had thrown an aureola of glory around the promised
delights. The temptation shone in a borrowed light. So does he ever
present the attractions of evil. This threefold temptation appealed to
"the lust of the flesh," "the lust of the eyes," and "the pride of life."
1 John 2:16.
    "The serpent plucked the fruit of the forbidden tree, and placed it
in the hands of the half-reluetant Eve."—Id., p. 55.
   10. What was the forlorn result of the experience of Adam and
Eve with the tempter? How did they give expression to their new knowl-
edge? Verse 7.
   NOTE.—Not only were their eyes opened to "good and evil," but also
to sin, misery, and remorse; they discerned their folly; they tasted the
bitter fruit of transgression. "How are the mighty fallen!" God's own
glorious covering exchanged for an apron of leaves!
    11. How did Adam and Eve reveal the change that had taken place
in them? Verse 8, last part.
   NoTE.—What a picture—the master of the world cringing and hid-
ing from Him who had given him all that he had! "Innocence stays in
the light, guilt always flies to cover."
   12. What is the first view given of God after sin came into the
world? Verse 8, first part; verse 9.
   NOTE.—Jesus came to earth to seek and to save that which was lost.
That was the object of the Lord's visit to the Garden of Eden on that
fateful day in the cool of the evening—to seek the lost. The question,
"Where art thou'?" implies that man was lost, and that God was seeking
him. Where art thou? is the question that God asks of us all, and that
we ought ever to answer,—exactly where we are in God's work, in Chris-
tian growth, in spiritual life, in the kingdom of Christ.
   13. What was Adam's response to the Lord's solicitude? Verse 10.
   NOTE.—Adam did not confess his sin, but only his fear and shame
at his bodily nakedness.
   14. What direct question did the Lord then ask Adam? What was
Adam's response? Verses 11, 12.
   15. How was Eve given an opportunity to confess her sin? How did
she improve her opportunity? Verse 13.
   NOTE.—"'Why didst Thou create the serpent? Why didst Thou stif-
                                  f 24 ]
fer him to enter Eden l'—these were the questions implied in her [Eve's]
excuse for her sin."—Id., p. 58.
   16. Where did God begin to mete out judgment upon the transgres-
sors? Verse 14.
    NoTE.—Punishment was first pronounced upon the medium Satan
used. "From the most beautiful and admired of the creatures of the
field, it was to become the most groveling and detested of them all,
feared and hated by both man and beast."—Ibid.
    17. What did the Lord say He would do to lessen Satan's influence
in the world? Verse 15.
   NoTE.—"Had not God specially interposed, Satan and man would
have entered into an alliance against Heaven; and instead of cherish-
ing enmity against Satan, the whole human family would have been
united in opposition to God."—"The Great Controversy," p. 505.
    18. What pronouncement was then made to Eve? Verse 16.
    19. What solemn sentence was pronounced on Adam? Verses 17-19.
    20. What must have brought home to Adam and Eve the enormity
of their sin as nothing else could have done? Verses 22-24.
    Nova.—Adam and Eve "earnestly entreated that they might remain
in the home of their innocence and joy. They confessed that they had
forfeited all right to that happy abode, but pledged themselves for the
future to yield strict obedience to God. But they were told that their
nature had become depraved by sin; they had lessened their strength to
resist evil, and had opened the way for Satan to gain more ready access
to them. In their innocence they had yielded to temptation; and now,
in a state of conscious guilt, they would have less power to maintain their
integrity. In humility and unutterable sadness they bade farewell to
their beautiful home, and went forth to dwell upon the earth, where
rested the curse of sin."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 61.



               Lesson 9—August 31, 1929
             THE GREAT REDEMPTION
MEMORY VERSE: John 3:16.
SEED THOUGHT: "God first came down to create; then to save. To create,
   God had only to speak; to redeem, He had to suffer. He made man by His
   breath; He saved him by His blood." (See Rom. 5:9.)

                              THE LESSON
  1. What clothing did the Lord provide for His exiled children?
Gen. 3:21.
  NoTE.—Death was a sign of God's wrath. Man must learn that sin
could be covered only by pain and blood, and that by no easy process
could the sinner be restored to peace with God. May it not be that the
                                   [ 25 ]
first garments the Lord provided for the guilty pair typified the fact
that they could never be clothed with a robe of righteousness without
the shedding of the blood of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the
world?
    2. What must Adam have realized more and more as he witnessed
the changes going on about him? 2 Peter 2:19, last part.
    NoTE.—"In drooping flower and falling leaf Adam and his com-
panion witnessed' the first signs of decay. Vividly 'was brought to their
minds the stern fact that every living thing must die. Even the air,
upon which their life depended, bore the seeds of death. Continually
they were reminded also of their lost dominion. Among the lower crea-
tures Adam had stood as king, and so long as he remained loyal to God,
all nature acknowledged his rule; but when he transgressed, this do-
minion was forfeited. The spirit of rebellion, to which he himself had
given entrance, extended throughout the animal creation."—"Educa-
tion," p. 26.
    3. In man's night of woe, what star of hope shone out clear and
bright? Gen. 3:15.
    NoTE.—To man the first intimation of redemption was communi-
cated in the sentence pronounced upon Satan in the garden. . . . This
sentence [Gen. 3:15], uttered in the hearing of our first parents, was
to them a promise. While it foretold war between man and Satan, it
declared that the power of the 'great adversary would finally be 'broken."
—"Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 65, 66.
    What wondrous love the Lord manifests toward His erring children,
—"Adam and Eve stood as criminals before the righteous Judge, await-
ing the sentence which transgression had incurred; but before they
heard of the life of toil and sorrow which must be their po'rtion, or of
thedecree that they 'must return to dust, they listened to' words that
could not fail to' give them hope. Though they must suffer from the
power of their mighty foe, they could look 'forward to final victory."—
Id., p. 66.
    4. After man's fall, how only could he be brought into peace with
God? John 3:16.
    NOTE.—When Adam and Eve comprehended the fact that the plan
for their salvation involved the death of the Son of God, "they pleaded
that the penalty might not fall upon Him whose love had been the source
of all their joy; rather let it descend upon them and their posterity."—
Ibid. Also "the angels prostrated themselves at the feet of their Com-
mander, and offered to become a sacrifice for man." But all were as-
sured that "since the law of Jehovah is the foundation of His govern-
ment in heaven as well as upon the earth, even the life of an angel could
not be accepted as a sacrifice for its transgression."—Id., pp. 64, 65.
    5. How could the dominion lost by Adam be restored? Micah 4:8.
    NOTE.—"Christ, by His sacrifice paying the penalty of sin, would not
only redeem man, but recover the dominion which he had forfeited. All
that was lost by the first Adam will be restored by the second."—Id.
p. 67. How easily the dominion was lost! How much it cost to redeem it!
                                1261
     6. When the angels understood all that was inVolVed iii the plan of
redemption, what song did they sing? Luke 2:13, 14.           '
     No-rt, —"Joy,'inexpressible-joy,ffilled heaven: The glory and blessed-
ness of a world redeemed, outmeasured even the anguish and sacrifice
of the. Prince of life. Through. the. celestial Courts echoed . the first
strains of that song which was to ring out above, the hills of Bethlehem,
—`Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward
men.' With a deeper gladness now than in the rapture-of the new crea-
tion, 'the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted
for joy.'         p. 65.                         •
     7. When was thiS "peace" and "good will toward men" more fully
revealed? Luke 2:11; Isa. 9:6.
     Noat.- "We marvel at the Saviour's sacrifice in exchanging the
throne of heaven for the manger; and the companionship of adoring an-
gels for the beasts of the stall. Human pride and self-sufficiency stand
rebuked in His presence. -Yet this was but the beginning of His wonder-
ful condescension. It would have been an almost infinite humiliation for
the Son of God to take man's nature; even when Adani stood in his inno-
cence in Eden. But Jesus accepted humanity when the race had been
weakened by four thousand years of sin: Like every child of Adain. He
accepted the results of the working of the great laW of heredity; What
these results were is shown in the history of His earthly ancestors. He
came with such a heredity to share our sorrows and temptations, and to
give us the example of a sinless lite."—".The Desire of Ages," p. 48.
     8. When Jesus finally came to earth to carry out the great redemp-
tive plan, what was it that broke His heart of love? John 1:11. -
• NoTiE.God Created the earth. God loved the world:
                     "0 Lo.ic• that will not let me gO;
                         I rest iny' weary soul in Thee:
                      I give Thee back the life I owe,
                         That in Thine ocean depths its flow
                      May richer, fuller be!"
     9. When the price of redemption had been fully paid, and Jesus
ascended triumphant,. how did heaven celebiate the glorious event?
Ps. 24:7-10.
     NOTE.—The last expression of infinite love that Jesus gave to His
 redeemed' ones is thlis described: "As He passed upward, the awe-
stricken disciples looked with straining eyes for the last glimpse of their
ascending Lord. A cloud of glory hid Him -from their sight; and the
words came back to them as the cloudy Chariot of angels received Him,
'Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.' At the same
time there floated down to them the Sweetest and most joyous music
from -the angel choir."-"The Desire of Ages," pp. 830, 831.
     10. To whom will the restored dominion be given? Ps. 37:29.
    .11. How does this promise coincide with that .made to ,Abraham?
Rom. 4:13; Gal. 3:29.
     12. What two things does this restoration imply? 2 Peter 3:10;
 Isa. 65:17.
                                        271
   13. In view of those things, what admonitions are given us? 2 Peter
3:11; Isa. 65:18.
   14. What vision was given the apostle John of the restored do-
minion? Rev. 21:1.
   15. What gracious promise has been the hope and comfort of the
righteous ever since the Redeemer left the earth? John 14:1-3.
   16. What events are connected with the fulfillment of this promise?
1 Thess. 4:15-18.
    17. At the end of the millennium, when the New Jerusalem descends
to the earth, what other phase of redemption takes place? 2 Peter 3:
10, 13.
    NOTE.—"The time has come, to which holy men have looked with
longing since the flaming sword barred the first pair from Eden,—the
time for 'the redemption of the purchased possession.' The earth orig-
inally given to man as his kingdom, betrayed by him into the hands of
Satan, and so long held by the mighty foe, has been brought back by
the great plan of redemption. All that was lost by sin has been re-
stored. . . . God's original purpose in the creation of the earth is ful-
filled as it is made the eternal abode of the redeemed."—"The Great
Controversy," p. 674.
    18. How will the ransomed of the Lord express their joy as they
take possession of the earth made new? Isa. 35:10.
    NOTE.—"The people of God are privileged to hold open communion
with the Father and the Son. . . . All the treasures of the universe
will be open to the study of God's redeemed. Unfettered by mortality,
they wing their tireless flight to worlds afar,—worlds that thrilled with
sorrow at the spectacle of human woe, and, rang with songs of gladness
at the tidings of a ransomed soul. With unutterable delight the children
of earth enter into the joy and the wisdom of unfallen beings."—Id.,
pp. 676, 677.



              Lesson 1 0 —September 7, 1929
  OBEDIENCE BETTER THAN SACRIFICE
LESSON. SCRIPTURE: Gen. 4:1-15.
MEMORY VERSE: 1 Sam. 15:22.
SEED THOUGHT: "True reverence is shown by obedience. God has commanded
   nothing that is unessential, and there is no other way of manifesting reverence
   so pleasing to Him as obedience to that which He has spoken.'—"Educa-
   tion," p. 244.
                                 THE LESSON
   1. Name the first brothers. What occupation did each follow? Gen.
4:1,2.
   2. How did they differ in character? 1 John 3:12.
                                ( 28
     Nom.—"Abel had a spirit of loyalty to God; he saw justice and
 mercy in the Creator's dealings with the fallen race, and gratefully ac-
 cepted the hope of redemption. But Cain cherished feelings of rebel-
 lion, and murmured against God because of the curse pronounced upon
 the earth and upon the human race for Adam's sin. He permitted his
 mind to run in the same channel that led to Satan's fall,—indulging
 the desire for self-exaltation, and questioning the divine justice and
 authority."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 71.
     3. From the record, what undesirable traits of character can you
 discern in Cain? Gen. 4:5, 7-9.
     4. What did these brothers understand? Heb. 9:22, last part.
     NoTE.—"These brothers were tested, as Adam had been tested before
 them, to prove whether they would believe and obey the word of God.
 They were acquainted with the provision,made for the salvation of man,
 and understood the system of offerings which God had ordained. They
 knew that in these offerings they were to express faith in the Saviour
 whom the offerings typified. . . . Without the shedding of blood, there
 could be no remission of sin; and they were to show their faith in the
'blood of Christ as the promised atonement, by offering the firstlings of
 the flock in sacrifice."—Ibid.
     5. When Cain and Abel came to make an offering to God, what did
 each bring? What did each offering signify concerning the one who
 offered it? Gen. 4:3, 4.
     NomE.—"Cain came before God with murmuring and infidelity in
 his heart in regard to the promised sacrifice and the necessity of the
 sacrificial offerings. His gift expressed no penitence for sin. . . . Abel
 grasped the great principles of redemption. He saw himself a sinner,
 and he saw sin, and its penalty death, standing between his soul and
 communion with God. He brought the slain victim, the sacrificed life,
 thus acknowledging the claims of the law that had been transgressed.
 Through the shed blood he looked to the future sacrifice, Christ dying
 on the cross of Calvary ; and trusting in the atonement that was there
 to be made, he had the witness that he was righteous, and his offering
 accepted."—Id., p. 72.
     6. How did the Lord distinguish between the offerings of Cain and
 Abel? Verses 4. 5.
     7. What does the Lord account of greater worth than any offering?
1 Sam. 15:22.
     NOTE.—The Lord never changes. He is "the same yesterday, and
 to-day, and forever." He said to Israel by His prophet. "I desired mercy,


               Thirteenth Sabbath Offering
                   September 28,1929
                       MALAYSIA
                                   [ 29 ]
alid not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings."
Hosea 6:6.      our worship, are we not in danger of substituting material
giftS and ceremonies for those traits of character,—obedience, mercy,
and,love,—that alone find acceptance with the Lord? Our knowledge
of., God increases as we study the word, His handiwork in the natural
world, and His dealings with His people in all ages, and this knowledge
results in. deepening our love for Him and for His children, Abiding love
for God brings willing obedience.
    8. What .spirit did Cain manifest when it was observed that his of-
fering was not accepted? Gen. 4:5.
    NoTE.—We are told of the spirit of love Abel manifested toward his
brother : "Abel pleaded with his brother to approach God in the divinely
prescribed way; but his entreaties only made Cain the more determined
to, fqllow his own will. As the eldest, he felt above being admonished by
his brother, and despised his counsel."—Id., pp. 71, 72.
     9. When Cain through his disturbed feelings stood, on dangerous
ground, how did the Lord manifest His love toward him? Verses 6, 7.
     NOTE—"Tlirough an angel messenger the divine warning was con:
veyed : 'If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? And if thou doest
not well, sin lieth at the door.' The choice lay with Cain himself. . .
Should he persist in unbelief and transgression, he would have no ground
for' complaint because he was rejected by the Lord."—Id., p. 74.
    104 Through continuing to cherish hatred and jealousy, what crime
did Cain4nally commit? Verse 8. •
    1*1-0TE.—In the case of Cain and his parents, we Can see the far-
reaching results of a wrong chbice. Is it not a certainty
                                                      , that
                                                          - our choices
go far beyond ourselves?
    11, How can Cain's feeling of hatred toward: his brother, who was
in the right, be explained? John 3:20; Amos 5:10.
    NoTEr=-"The murder of Abel, was the: first example of the: enmity
that God had declared would exist between the serpent and the Seed of
the woman,—between Satan and his subjects and Christ and His'follow-
ers."—Id., p. 77.
    12. How was Cain soon called to account for his crime? By what
question did. Cain's insolence reveal itself? Gen, 4:9.
    NOTE.—Does not the Lord put the question, Where is thy brother?
to each of us? Are we not to look about us "diligently lest any man fail
of the grace of Gqd"? Heb. 12:15. Are we not, like the apostle Paul,
debtors to all men? Rom. 1:14. This question imposes upon us a duty
not only to look after the spiritual welfare of our brother, but also to
minister to his temporal needs.
    13. In what striking words did the Lord refer to Cain's great crime?
Verse 10.
    14. What penalty was then pronounced upon the guilty one? Verses
11, 12.
                                  1 30
    NOTE.—"God had given Cain an opportunity to confess his sin. He
had had time to reflect. He knew the enormity of, the deed he had done,
and of the falsehood he had uttered to conceal it; but he was rebellious
still, and sentence was no longer deferred. The divine voice that had
been heard in entreaty and admonition pronounced the terrible words."
—Ibid.
    15. What was Cain's response when he learned of the punishment
he was to receive? Verses 13, 14.
     NOTE.—Cain desired God's protection even though he was unwill-
ing to give the Lord his heart's devotion.
    16. How did the Lord still manifest a tender sympathy toward the
erring one? Verse 15.
     NOTE.—Even then mercy would have been extended to Cain had he
repented. Forgiveness is ever ready for the repentant sinner, as the
prophet Hosea's appeal to Israel testifies: "Come," he entreated, "and
let us return unto the Lord: for He hath torn, and He will heal."
Hosea 6:1.


     Lesson 11—September 14, 1929
DESTRUCTION FOLLOWS DESECRATION
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Gen. 4:16-22; 5; 6; 7.
MEMORY VERSE: "He that soweth iniquity shall reap calamity." Prov. 22:8,
   American Revised Version.
SEED THOUGHT: "Love, illumined by light, acts not merely in the interest of
   the Present moment, but of all the coming centuries. There is a severity which
   is of the very essence of tenderness; and the story of the Flood is an instante
   of the activity of the love of God."—G. Campbell Morgan.
                             THE LESSON
    L Where did Cain go after leaving the presence of the Lord? Gen.
4:16.
    NomE.—"Upon receiving the curse of God, Cain had withdrawn from
his father's household. He had first chosen his occupation as a tiller of
the soil, and he now founded a city, calling it after the name of his
eldest son. He had gone out from the presence of the Lord, cast away
the promise of the restored Eden, to seek his possessions and enjoyment
in the earth under the curse of sin, thus standing at the head of that
great class of men who worship the god of this world."—"Patriarchs
and Prophets," p. 81.
    2. How gifted were some of Cain's descendants? Verses 21, 22.
    NoTE.—We read of no Noahs or righteous Enochs among Cain's
descendants, though they were gifted in the invention and development
of worldly arts and sciences. It is to be regretted that their intellectual
ability was not accompanied by the desired spirituality. "Cain and his
descendants did not respect the day upon which God had rested. They
                                      [.31
chose their own time for labor and for rest, regardless of Jehovah's ex-
press command."—Ibid.
   3. Who was raised up to take the place of Abel? Gen. 5:3.
    NoTE.—"The name Seth, given to this son, signified 'appointed,' or
`compensation ;"f or ' said the mother, 'God hath appointed me another
seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.' Seth was of more noble stature
than Cain or Abel, and resembled Adam more closely than did his other
sons. He was a worthy character, following in the steps of Abel."—
Id., p. 80.
    4. How long did Seth have the counsel and cooperation of his father
in upholding the ways of righteousness? Verses 4, 5.
   NOTE.—"For nearly a thousand years, Adam lived among men, a
witness to the results of sin. Faithfully he sought to stem the tide of
evil. He had been commanded to instruct his posterity in the way of
the Lord; and he carefully treasured what God had revealed to him,
and repeated it to succeeding generations."—Id., p. 82.
    5. What man of God was among Seth's descendants? Verses 18,
22, 24.
    NoTE.—"Epoch's walk with God was not in a trance or a vision, but
in all the duties of his daily life. He did not become a hermit, shutting
himself entirely from the world; for he had a work to do for God in
the world. In the family and in his intercourse with man, as a husband
and father, a friend, a citizen, he was the steadfast, unwavering servant
of the Lord."—Id., p. 85.
   6. What was one cause of the evil condition that existed many years
before the Flood? Gen. 6:1, 2.
   NovE.—"For some time the two classes remained separate. The race
of Cain, spreading from the place of their first settlement, dispersed
over the plains and valleys where the children of Seth had dwelt; and
the latter, in order to escape from their contaminating influence, with-
drew to the mountains, and there made their home. So long as this
separation continued, they maintained the worship of God in its purity.
But in the lapse of time they ventured, little by little, to mingle with
the inhabitants of the valleys. This association was productive of the
worst results. 'The sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were
fair.' The children of Seth, attracted by the beauty of the daughters
of Cain's descendants, displeased the Lord by intermarrying with them.
Many of the worshipers of God were beguiled into sin by the allure-
ments that were now constantly before them, and they lost their pecul-
iar, holy character."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 81.
   7. What did the Lord finally purpose to do? Verse 7.
   8. How long time was given the people for reformation? Verse 3.
   9. Whom did the Lord take into His confidence? Verses 8, 13.
   NOTE.—The darkness of the age of Noah enhanced the luster of his
loyalty to God. The evil in the world is no excuse for our partaking of it.
   10. What plan of work was outlined to Noah? Verses 14-16.
                               321
    NOTE.—"While building the ark he [Noah] was to preach that God
would bring a flood of water upon the earth to destroy the wicked.
Those who would believe the message, and would prepare for that event
by repentance and reformation, should find pardon and be saved. Enoch
had repeated to his children what God had shown him in regard to the
Flood, and Methuselah and his sons, who lived to hear the preaching of
Noah, assisted in building the ark."—Id., p. 92.
    11. How did the people of Noah's time regard his work and message
of reform? Matt. 24:38, 39.
    12. What made it especially difficult for the people to believe that
the earth could be destroyed by a flood? What enabled Noah to accept
it as a fact? Gen. 2:5, 6; Heb. 11:7, first part.
    NoTE.—"The world before the Flood reasoned that for centuries the
laws of nature had been fixed. The recurring seasons had come in their
order. Heretofore rain had never fallen; the earth had been watered by
a mist or dew. The rivers had never yet passed their boundaries, but
had borne their waters safely to the sea. Fixed decrees had kept the
waters from overflowing their banks. But these reasoners did not recog-
nize the hand of Him who had stayed the waters, saying, 'Hitherto shalt
thou come, but no further.' "—Id., pp. 96, 97.
    13. What gracious promise was given Noah? Gen. 6:17, 18.
    14. What plan did the Lord have for the animals? What provision
was made for the sustenance of all during the stay in the ark? Verses
19-21.
    15. What word then came to the builder of the ark? Gen. 7:1-4.
    NOTE.—"The first 'come' of the Bible is one of salvation—Tome
thou and all thy house into the ark.' So is the last 'come'—'the Spirit
and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let
him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water
of life freely.' " Rev. 22:17.—D. L. Moody.
    16. After Noah had done all that the Lord commanded, what hap-
 pened? Verse 16, last part.
    NOTE.—The "hand which destroys the sinner secures the saint."
    "The seal of heaven was on that door ; God had shut it, and God
alone could open it."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 98.
    17. What final test of faith was given? What came to pass on the
 eighth day after the door of the ark was closed? Verses 10, 11.
    18. At the end of one hundred fifty days, how did the earth which
 had once been such a joy, appear? Verses 19-23.
    19. Though the Lord must punish sinners, in what spirit is it done?
 Lam. 3:31-33.
     20. What is the Lord's appeal to those in sin? Eze. 33:11.
     NorE.—"The sins that called for vengeance upon the antediluvian
 world, exist to-day. The fear of God is banished from the hearts of
 men, and, His law is treated with indifference and contempt. The in-
                                   E33]
tense worldliness of that generation is equaled by that of the genera-
tion now living."—Id., p. 101. '
     "When the reasoning of philosophy has banished the fear of God's
judgments; when religious teachers are pointing forward to long ages
of peace and prosperity, and the world are absorbed in their rounds
of business and pleasure, planting and building, feasting and merry-
making, rejecting God's warnings and mocking His messengers,—then
it is that sudden destruction cometh upon them, and they shall not es-
cape."—Id., p. 104.



       Lesson 12 —September 21, 19 2 9
   THE RESTORATION AND DISPERSION
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Genesis 8; 9; 11.
MEMORY VERSE: Isa. 54:10.
SEED THOUGHT: "Cultivate the spirit of moral interpretation; then the rain-
   bow will keep away the flood; the fowls of the air will save you from anxiety;
   the lilies of the field will assure you of tender care."—D. L. Moody.
                             THE LESSON
    1. How did the Lord finally reveal His remembrance of Noah?
Gen. 8:1-3.
    NOTE.—Forgetfulness belongs not to the Almighty. The butler may
forget Joseph; the king •may forget Mordecai; the poor wise man may
be forgotten by the city he delivered (Eccl. 9:15) ; but "God is not
unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love." Heb. 6:10. A book
of remembrance is ever before Him. Mal. 3:16.
    2. Where did the ark find a resting place? What effort did Noah
make to learn the condition of the world outside? Verses 4, 6-12.
   3. What acceptable word finally came to Noah? Verses 15-17.
    4. How did Noah express his gratitude to the Lord for His preserv-
ing care? Verse 20.
    NOTE.—"Noah had come forth upon a desolate earth; but before
preparing a house for himself, he built an altar to God. His stock of
cattle was small, and had been preserved at great expense; yet he cheer-
fully gave a part to the Lord, as an acknowledgment that all was His.
In like manner it should be our first care to render our freewill offer-
ings to God. Every manifestation of His mercy and love toward us
should be gratefully acknowledged, both by acts of devotion and by
gifts to His cause."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 106.             •
   5. How was this expression of gratitude received by the Lord? To
what determination did the Lord give expression? Verses 21, 22.
   NOTE.—"The praise and thanksgiving from grateful hearts will as-
cend to God as a sweet oblation. The Lord desires us to make mention
of His goodness and tell of His power. He is honored by the expression
                                 [ 34 ]
of praise and thanksgiving. He says, Whoso offereth praise glorifieth
Me.' "—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 29S.
    6. How did the Lord ratify His covenant not to destroy the earth
again by flood? Gen. 9:12-17.
                "Wilt thou not open the heart to know
                 What rainbows teach, and sunsets show?"
    7. What physical changes resulted from the Flood?
    NorE.—"The entire surface of the earth was changed at the Flood.
A third dreadful curse rested upon it in consequence of sin. Ai- the
water began to subside, the hills and mountains were surrounded- by a
vast, turbid sea. Everywhere were strewn the dead bodies of men and
beasts. The-Lord would not permit these to remain to decompose and
pollute the air, therefore He made of the earth a vast burial ground.
A violent wind which was caused to blow for the purpose of drying up
the waters, moved them with great force, in some instances even carry-
ing away the tops of the mountains, and heaping up trees, rocks, and
earth above the bodies of the dead. By the same means the silver and
gold, the choice wood and precious stones, which had enriched and
adorned the world before the Flood, and which the inhabitants had
idolized, were concealed from the sight and search of men, the violent
action of the waters piling earth and rocks upon these treasures, and in
some cases even forming mountains above them. . . . The earth pre-
sented an appearance of confusion and desolation impossible to describe.
The mountains, once so beautiful in their perfect symmetry, had become
broken and irregular. Stones, ledges, and ragged rocks were now scat-
tered upon the surface of the earth. In many places, hills and moun-
tains had disappeared, leaving no trace where they once stood; and
plains had given place to mountain ranges. . . . At this time immense
forests were buried. These have since been changed to coal, forming
the extensive coal beds that now exist, and also yielding large quantities
of oil."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 107, 108.
    8. How long did Noah live after the Flood? Verse 28.
    9. What was true of all the people of the earth for many, years after
the Flood? Gen. 11:1.
     10. What did a large company of Noah's descendants who were
 constantly annoyed by the teaching and example of their ,God-fearing
 associates decide to do? Where did they settle? Verse 2.
     11. What unholy proposition did they attempt to carry out? Verse 4.
     NOTE.—"Here they decided to build a city, and in it a tower of such
 stupendous height as should render it the wonder of the world. These
 enterprises were designed to prevent the people from scattering abroad
 in colonies. God had directed men to disperse throughout the earth, to
 replenish and subdue it ; .but these Babel builders determined to keep
 their community united in one body, and to found a monarchy_ that
 should eventually embrace the whole earth. Thus their city would be-
 come the metropolis of a universal empire; its glory would command
 the admiration and homage of the world, and render the founders illus-
                                   [ 351
trious. The magnificent tower, reaching to the 1 -vens, was intended
to stand as a monument of the power and wisdom of its builders, per-
petuating their fame to the latest generations. . . . One object before
them in the erection of the tower was to secure their own safety in case
of another deluge. By carrying the structure to a much greater height
than was reached by the waters of the Flood, they thought to plac3
themselves beyond all possibility of danger."—Id., p. 118.
   12. How did the Lord thwart this evil work? Verses 5-7.
    13. What was the result of this confusion of tongues? Verses 8, 9.
    NoTE.—"Those that could understand one another's speech united
in companies; some went one way, and some another. . . . This disper-
sion was the means of peopling the earth; and thus the Lord's purpose
was accomplished through the very means that men had employed to
prevent its fulfillment. But at what a loss to those who had set them-
selves against God! It was His purpose, that, as men should go forth
to found nations in different parts of the earth, they should carry with
them a knowledge of His will, that the light of truth might shine un-
dimmed to succeeding generations."—Id., p. 120.
   14. What lesson should we learn from this experience of the Babel
builders? Ps. 33:13, 14.
   NOTE.—"The time of God's investigation is at hand. The Most High
will come down to see that which the children of men have builded. His
sovereign power will be revealed; the works of human pride will be laid
low."—Id., p. 124. Then the tower builders of our time, who have not
built upon the true foundation (1 Cor. 3:10, 11), but have built upon
the foundation of human reasoning, upon science, falsely so-called, upon
the speculations and pleasing fables of men instead of the word of God,
will be discomfited, and will have their work brought to naught. May
it then be found that we have built upon the eternal Rock, Christ Jesus.


     Lesson 13 —September 2 8, 1929
 REMINDERS IN NATURE OF THE CREA-
    TOR'S GRACIOUS CHARACTER
MEMORY VERSE: Isa. 28:16.
SEED THOUGHT: "For six thousand years, faith has builded upon Christ. For
   six thousand years the floods and tempests of. Satanic wrath have beaten upon
   the Rock of our salvation; but it stands unmoved." "The entire world may
   lay upon it their burdens and griefs; it can endure them all. With perfeet
   safety they may build upon it. Christ is a 'tried stone.' Those who trust in
   Him, He never disappoints."—"The Desire of Ages," pp. 413, 598, 599.
                          THE LESSON
   1. What part did Jesus perform in the work of creation? John 1:
1-3; Heb. 1:2.
   NOTE.—Many distinct titles are given to the Deity in the Bible, and
no small number of these are associated with things of the natural world.
                                 [36.1
Thus did the Lord design that we should have our minds continually
directed to Him through the things about us.
    2. As the laght of each new day comes to us, what thought should
come to mind? What prayer should express our desire for the day?
John 1:8, 9.
    NOTE.—Light is of such capacity that the divine nature, seeking for
an expression of its own omnipotence was content to say, "God is
light." Surely He is the light of the world: without Him all is dark-
ness. So morning by morning we should pray that our own souls may be
lighted that day by the True Light.
    3. In the final great conflict, what has the Lord promised to be to
His people? Joel 3:16.        .
    NOTE.—The margin says "place of repair, or, harbor." The Lord is
the only one to whom man can look for a haven of rest and peace in the
coming time of turmoil and storm, when "the earth shall reel to and
fro like a drunkard, and shall be removed like a cottage" (Isa. 24:20) ;
and when "the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll" (Isa. 34:4) ;
and "the great day of His wrath is come" (Rev. 6:17). While the
wicked are dying from hunger and pestilence, angels will shield the
righteous and supply their wants.
    4. To whom has the Lord always been a strength? Isa. 25:4, first
part.
    NOTE.—We are told that "he that hath a bountiful eye shall be
blessed; for he giveth of his bread to the poor." Prov. 22:9. The Lord
evidently expects us to cultivate the "bountiful eye"—the eye that takes
pictures of the pleasant things in the lives of others and makes us
generous in our judgments of them; the eye which causes us to give
sympathy, affection, and happiness as well as material food and cloth-
ing to those in need.
    5. Upon what will the fourth angel pour out his vial of God's wrath?
What will be the result? Rev. 16:8, 9.
    NoTE.—"In that day, multitudes will desire the shelter of God's
mercy which they have so long despised."—"The Great Controversy,"
p. 629.
    "The prophets thus describe the condition of the earth at this fear-
ful time: 'The land mourneth; . . . because the harvest of the field is
perished.' All the trees of the field are withered; because joy is withered
away from the sons of men.' The seed is rotten under their clods, the
garners are laid desolate.' How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle
are perplexed, because they have no pasture. . . . The rivers of waters
are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness.' "
—Id., p. 628.
    6. What has the Lord promised to be to His children in this time of
intense heat? Isa. 25:4.
    NOTE.—"The darkest hour of the church's struggle with the powers
of evil, is that which immediately precedes the day of her final deliver-
ance. But none who trust in God need fear; for 'when the blast of the
                                    [ 37]
terrible ones is as a storm against the wall,' God will be to His church
`a refuge from the storm.' "—"Prophets and Sings," p. 725.
    The word of the Lord to His faithful ones is recorded in Isa. 26:20.
    7. What did Zacharias prophesy Jesus should be? Luke 1:69, 77.
    NOTE.—A strong, powerful defender and Saviour from the great
enemy of all good is here promised. The word horn in this text, as in
several others, symbolizes power. Salvation is the all-inclusive word of
the gospel, gathering unto itself all the redemptive acts and processes,
as justification, redemption, propitiation, imputation, forgiveness, sanc-
tification, and glorification.
     8. What does Jesus say He is to the seeker after truth and salva-
tion? John 14:6.
    9. How did David regard the Lord? Ps. 31:3.
     NOTE.—The psalmist seemed to take special comfort in the thought
of the Lord's steadfastness and dependableness as signified by the rocks,
 for he speaks of the Lord as "the Rock of my refuge" (Ps. 94:22) ;
"the Rock of my strength" (Ps. 62:7) ; "the Rock of my heart" (Ps.
73:26, margin) ; "a Rock of habitation" (Ps. 71:3, margin) ; "my Rock,
and my Redeemer" (Ps. 19:14, margin) ; "my Rock and my Fortress"
 (Ps. 31:3) ; "the Rock that is higher than I" (Ps. 61:2). The prophet
 Isaiah speaks of Him as "the Rock of Ages" (Isa. 26:4, margin), and
 David, as the "Rock of my salvation" (2 Sam. 22:47) ; while the apostle
 Paul calls Him "that spiritual Rock" (1 Cor. 10:4). Surely He is the
 Rock of eternal truth upon which the church of God is built. (See
 Isa. 28:16).
     10. How do the angels look upon the Lord? Rev. 5:12.
     NOTE.—He was slain that He might receive power, riches, wisdom,
 strength, honor, glory, and blessing to pass on to us. "The Lamb shall
 overcome them" (Rev. 17:14), that we may overcome through His
 strength.
     11. What should the vine with its branches call to our minds? John
15:5.
     12. What spiritual truths should the bread and water upon our tables
 suggest? John 6:51; 4:13, 14.
     13. How did Zacharias speak of Jesus? Luke 1:78.
     NOTE.—Zacharias referred to Jesus as the "Dayspring," who shines
  upon our darkness, turning it into day, and guiding lost feet into the
 way of peace.
     14. As we look upon the stars, what comforting assurance do we
  have? Num. 24:17 ; Rev. 22 :16.
      15. What comforting promise does the sun suggest? Mal. 4:2.
      16. When we sense the greatness of the material creation, and see
  how closely the Lord relates Himself to it, in what hymn of praise can
  we join reverently and whole-heartedly? Psalm 147.

     A Sabbath school at one of the mission stations in Angola, West Africa



          The Large "Overflow" for Africa
    A letter from Elder W. H. Branson, president of the African Divi-
sion, tells in detail of what was done with the $27,700 "overflow" for
Africa. The following mission fields are listed as having a share in it :
    The Angola Union, the Zambezi Union, the two Congo Unions, and
the Southeast African Union. The latter Union will provide equipment
for missionaries going to open up work in North Nyasaland.
    Brother Branson says: "The Angola Union will use all their money
in starting a new mission station in charge of Elder W. H. Anderson.
They have secured a mission site at a very reasonable price, and will
equip it at once. The 'overflow' made this new station possible.
    "The 'overflow' also helped to purchase a new mission station in Pon-
doland. This new medical mission will serve a population of a million
natives, within a radius of a hundred Miles."

                   A Resolution of Thanks
    Our Sabbath schools throughout the world that made possible the
generous "overflow" which Africa received on March 31, 1928, will be in-
terested in the following resolution passed by the African Division Com-
mittee :
    "Whereas, The Sabbath schools of the world gave to the African
Division on March 31, 1928, the largest Thirteenth Sabbath Offering
ever given up to that time to missions, thus enabling the mission fields
in Africa to supply many long-delayed needs; therefore,
    "Resolved, That we express to our brethren and sisters in the Sabbath
schools of the world our most sincere thanks for their most liberal re-
sponse to our appeal for help in pushing the banner of the cross into
darkest Africa."
