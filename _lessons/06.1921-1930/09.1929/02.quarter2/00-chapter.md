TO HELP YOU
         In this quarter's lessons, you will
         have some studies on the importance
         of the tithe. There has recently been
         published a pamphlet on this sub-
         ject, entitled


Stewardship in Its Larger Aspects
               By L. E. FROOM

  The following paragraph from the book will
give a good idea of its contents:
      "This mighty principle neither begins nor
    ends with money. Tithing is stewardship as
    far as it goes. But stewardship in its larger
    aspects is the all-inclusive principle of the
    whole of life. It is not a theory nor a philoso-
    phy but a working program. It is in verity the
    Christian law of living. It forms the Christian
    appraisal of privilege, opportunity, power,
    and talent. It is necessary to an adequate un-
    derstanding of life, and essential to a true,
    vital religious experience. It is not simply a
    matter of mental assent, but is an act of the
    will and a definite, decisive transaction touch-
    ing the whole perimeter of life."

    The price is only 15 cents, postpaid.

                             LESSON 1
   THE CREATOR AND UPHOLDER OF ALL
                            April 6, 1929
MEMORY VERSE: John 1:1-3.
LESSON HELP: "Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 44-51 (new ed., pp. 29-37).

                            INTRODUCTION
     "God is the foundation of everything. All true science is in harmony
with His works; all true education leads to obedience to His government.
. . . No finite mind can fully comprehend the existence, the power, the
wisdom, or the works of the Infinite One.... The mightiest intellects of
earth can not comprehend God. Men may be ever searching, ever learn-
ing, and still there is an infinity beyond.
     "Yet the works of creation testify of God's power and greatness.
'The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament showeth His
handiwork.' Those who take the written word as their counselor will find
in science an aid to understand God. 'The invisible things of Him from
the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things
 that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead.' "—"Patriarchs
 and Prophets," pp. 115, 116.
                          THE LESSON
    1. To whom does the earth belong? Whose also are we? Ps. 24:1.
   2. On what basis does God claim the earth and its inhabitants?
Verse 2.
    3. By what means was the earth created? Ps. 33:6, 9.
    NomE.—When at earth's beginning God, with Christ as His agent,
created all things, it was not through some long period of years but
instantly at His spoken word. And to this day the evidence of the power
of His word is before us, for "God created the seed, as He created the
earth, by His word. By His word He gave it power to grow and mul-
tiply. . . . Every seed that sends up its green blade to the sunlight de-
clares the wonder-working power of that word uttered by Him who
`spake, and it was ;' who 'commanded, and it stood fast.'"—"Christ's
Object Lessons," pp. 80, 81.
   4. By virtue of His creative power, how fully does God claim owner-
ship of all? Ps. 50:10-12.
   5. What claim does God make upon the hidden treasures of the
earth? Haggai 2:8.
     6. How does David beautifully acknowledge the ownership of God?
1 Chron. 29:11-14.
     NomE.—"All things are God's, not only by creation, but by redemp-
 tion. All the blessings of this life and of the life to come, are delivered
 to us stamped with the cross of Calvary."—Id., p. 362.
                                      I3I
     7. Who was associated with God as the agent in creation? Col.
1:14-16.
     8. How fully did Christ enter into the work of creation with the
Father? John 1:1-3.
    NoTE.—"In the beginning, God was revealed in all the works of
creation. It was Christ that spread the heavens, and laid the founda-
tions of the earth. It was His hand that hung the worlds in space, and
fashioned the flowers of the field. 'His strength setteth fast the moun-
tains.' The sea is His, and He made it.' It was He that filled the earth
with beauty, and the air with song. And upon all things in earth, and
air, and sky, He wrote the message of the Father's love."—"The Desire
of Ages," p. 20.
   9. What material witness is given to the power and majesty of God
by His creation? Ps. 19:1-3, margin.
    10. When man was created, over what did God give him dominion?
Gen. 1:28; Ps. 8:6-8.
    NOTE.—"After the earth with its teeming animal and vegetable life,
bad been called into existence, man, the crowning work of the Creator,
and the one for whom the beautiful earth had been fitted up, was brought
upon the stage of action. To him was given dominion over all that his
eye could behold. . . .
   "He was placed, as God's representative, over the lower orders of
being. They can not understand or acknowledge the sovereignty of God,
yet they were made capable of loving and serving man."—"Patriarchs
and Prophets," pp. 44, 45.
    11. What specific work did God give into the hands of Adam?
Gen. 2:15.
    NoTE.—"To the dwellers in Eden was committed the care of the gar-
den, 'to dress it and to keep it.' Their occupation was not wearisome, but
pleasant and invigorating. God appointed labor as a blessing to man, to
occupy his mind, to strengthen his body, and to develop his faculties. In
mental and physical activity, Adam found one of the highest pleasures
of his holy existence. And when, as a result of his disobedience, he was
driven from his beautiful home, and forced to struggle with a stubborn
soil to gain his daily bread, that very labor, although widely different
from his pleasant occupation in the garden, was a safeguard against
temptation, and a source of happiness."—Id., p. 50.
   12. What limitation was placed upon man's control of the posses-
sions intrusted to him? Verses 16, 17.
   NOTE.—"God had made them [Adam and Eve] the recipients of rich
blessings; but should they disregard His will, He who spared not the
angels that sinned, could not spare them; transgression would forfeit
His gifts, and bring upon them misery and ruin."—Id., p. 53.
  13. As the earth is the Lord's, what, then, is man's relationship to
Him? Luke 19:12, 13.
                                  [4]
    NOTE.—God's children on earth are constantly referred to in His
words as His servants, His stewards, His witnesses, in this world. They
are here to occupy till He comes.
    14. As a servant, or steward, of God, what is required of every man?
1 Cor. 4:2; Luke 12:48, second sentence.
    Nora.—As recipients of His bounties, we are accountable to Him for
the use we make of His abundant gifts. The greater the blessings both
spiritual and temporal that He bestows upon us, the more will He require
of us in the final accounting. The bounties of God are bestowed for but
one purpose—that of honoring Him.
    15. In view of all that God has intrusted to mankind, what ought we
to do? What should we constantly consider? 1 Sam. 12:24.


                            LESSON 2
    THE CALL OF ANCIENT ISRAEL TO THE
             SERVICE OF GOD
                           April 13, 1929
MEMORY VERSE: Isa. 43:10.
LESSON HELPS: "Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 63-73 (new ed., pp. 59-71);
  "Prophets and Kings," pp. 367-378.
                            INTRODUCTION
    "God called Israel, and blessed and exalted them, not that by obedi-
ence to His law they alone might receive His favor, and become the
exclusive recipients of His blessings, but in order to reveal Himself
through them to all the inhabitants of the earth. It was for the accom-
plishment of this very purpose that He commanded them to keep them-
selves distinct from the idolatrous nations around them. . . . But God
did not intend that His people, in self-righteous exclusiveness, should
shut themselves away from the world, so that they could have no influ-
ence upon it. Like their Master, the followers of Christ in every age
were to be the light of the world."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 369.
                            THE LESSON
    1. Before God created the earth, what provision was made so that
His purpose for man should not fail? 2 Tim. 1:9; Eph. 1:4.
    NoTE.—"The plan for our redemption was not an afterthought, a
plan formulated after the fall of Adam. It was a revelation of 'the
mystery which hath been kept in silence through times eternal.' It was
an unfolding of the principles that from eternal ages have been the
foundation of God's throne. From the beginning, God and Christ knew
of the apostasy of Satan, and of the fall of man through the deceptive
power of the apostate. God did not ordain that sin should exist, but He
foresaw its existence, and made provision to meet the terrible emer-
gency."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 22.
                                  [ 51
   2. Whom did Adam obey instead of the Creator? Gen. 3:1-6.
   3. Having thus yielded, into what condition did he fall? 2 Peter
2:19, last clause.
   4. How much did man lose by the fall? Rom. 5:12; Gen. 3:17, 18.
    NorE.—"Not only man but the earth had by sin come under the
power of the wicked one, and was to be restored by the plan of redemp-
tion. . . . When man became Satan's captive, the dominion which he
held, passed to his conqueror. Thus Satan became 'the god of this
world.' He had usurped that dominion over the earth which had been
originally given to Adam. . . .
    "Adam, in his innocence, had enjoyed open communion with his
Maker ; but sin brought separation between God and man, and the atone-
ment of Christ alone could span the abyss, and make possible the com-
munication of blessing or salvation from heaven to earth. Man was still
cut off from direct approach to his Creator, but God would communicate
with him through Christ and angels."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 67.
  5. Because of Adam's transgression, what conditions developed
among men before the Flood? Gen. 6 : 5-7.
   6. How had those who were loyal to God acknowledged His supreme
power during these years? Gen. 4:3, 4.
    NoTE.—"They [Cain and Abel] knew that in these offerings they
were to express faith in the Saviour whom the offerings typified, and at
the same time to acknowledge their total dependence on Him for par-
don ; and they knew that by thus conforming to the divine plan for their
redemption, they were giving proof of their obedience to the will of
God."—Id., p. 71.
   7. After the Flood, what acknowledgment did Noah make of God's
saving and keeping power? Gen. 8:20.
    NorE.—"In the joy of their release, Noah did not forget Him by
whose gracious care they had been preserved. His first act after leaving
the ark was to build an altar, and offer from every kind of clean beast
and fowl a sacrifice, thus manifesting his gratitude to God for deliver-
ance, and his faith in Christ, the great sacrifice. This offering was
Pleasing to the Lord; and a blessing resulted, not only to the patriarch
and his family, but to all who should live upon the earth.. . Here was
a lesson for all succeeding generations. Noah had come forth upon a
desolate earth ; but before preparing a house for himself, he built an
altar to God. His stock of cattle was small, and had been preserved at
great expense; yet he cheerfully gave a part to the Lord, as an acknowl-
edgment that all was His. In like. manner it should be our first care to
render our free-will offerings to God. Every manifestation of His mercy
and love toward us should be gratefully acknowledged, both by acts of
devotion and by gifts to His cause."—Id., pp. 105, 106.
    8. As men again departed from God; and forgot their Maker, what
call was made to Abram? Gen. 12 : 1-5.
                                [6 ]
   9. What evidences do we have that Abraham fully acknowledged
God's love and power, and His ownership of all things? Gen. 12:8;
14:17-20.
  10. In calling Abram, what purpose did God have in mind for the
world? Gen. 12:2, 3.
   11. What experience came to Jacob on his journey to Haran? What
act of worship did he perform? What pledge did he make to God?
Gen. 28:10-22.
    Norm—Jacob had been a part of his father's family, and the tithe
had been paid by Isaac, the head of the household. And now Jacob was
separated from that family and was to be henceforth the head of his
own household, and he vowed to be true to God and to his father's and
his grandfather's practice in tithe paying.
    12. For what purpose did God call Israel and set them in Palestine
at the crossroads of the nations? Isa. 43:10-12; 44:8.
    NOTE.—"Often the Israelites seemed unable or unwilling to under-
stand God's purpose for the heathen. Yet it was this very purpose that
had made them a separate people, and had established them as an inde-
pendent nation among the nations of the earth. Abraham, their father,
to whom the covenant promise was first given, had been called to go
forth from his kindred, to the regions beyond, that he might be a light
bearer to the heathen. Although the promise to him included a posterity
as numerous as the sand by the sea, yet it was for no selfish purpose that
he was to become the founder of a great nation in the land of Canaan.
God's covenant with him embraced all the nations of earth."—"Prophets
and Kings," pp. 367, 368.
    13. In order that Israel might truly represent God, what must they
do? What did God promise to do for them? Deut..26:17-19.
    14. In what respect was Israel to be a separate and distinct people?
Ex. 33:16.
    NOTE.—"No earthly power or skill or learning can supply the place
of God's abiding presence."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 328.
    NOTE.—It was the abiding presence of God in Israel that made
them a people, apart, distinct, from the nations about them. So long as
 His presence was with them, they rightly and truly represented Him,
among the nations.
    15. What was to be their relation to the nations about them? Why?
 Deut. 7:2-4.
     Norm—Israel was expected to be a blessing and a light to the na-
tions about them. By their faithfulness and loyalty to Jehovah, they
were to draw others to an acknowledgment of the Creator, and to His
 service, but they were not to intermingle with the heathen about them.
 Intermarriage was forbidden, social intercourse that would bring them
 into daily contact with the idolatrous practices of their heathen neigh-
 boI.s was not to be permitted. Yet no stranger whose heart longings
 brought him within the boundary of God's heritage was forbidden to
                                    E7 ]
join himself to God's people in worship, or to identify himself with
God's chosen people as one of the people of the covenant.
    16. How were the Lord's people to relate themselves to the strangers
who came and dwelt among them? Ex. 12:44-49; 20:10; Lev. 19:34.
    NOTE.—"God had made provision that all who would renounce
heathenism, and connect themselves with Israel, should share the bless-
ings of the covenant. They were included under the term, 'the stranger
that sojourneth among you,' and with few exceptions this class were to
enjoy equal favors and privileges with Israel."—Id., p. 507.
    17. If Israel had followed God's plan in relating themselves to the
stranger and to the idolatrous nations, what would have been their
relation to God? Ex. 19:5, 6.
    NOTE.—"If obedient to His requirements, they [the Israelites] were
to be placed far in advance of other peoples in wisdom and understand-
ing; but this supremacy was to be reached and maintained only in order
that through them the purpose of God for 'all nations of the earth'
might be fulfilled."—"Prophets and Kings," pp. 368, 369.


                             LESSON 3
    GOD'S CLAIMS FORGOTTEN-A CALL TO
      REPENTANCE AND REFORMATION
                           April 20, 1929
MEMORY VERSE: Jer. 29: 10.
LESSON HELP: "Prophets and Kings," pp. 367-378, 618-627, 661-668.
                           INTRODUCTION
    "In his study of the causes leading to the Babylonish captivity, Ezra
had learned that Israel's apostasy was largely traceable to their min-
gling with heathen nations. He had seen that if they had obeyed God's
command to keep separate from the nations surrounding them, they
would have been spared many sad and humiliating experiences. Now
when he learned that notwithstanding the lessons of the past, men of
prominence had dared transgress the laws given as a safeguard against
apostasy, his heart was stirred within him. He thought of God's good-
ness in again giving His people a foothold in their native land, and he
was overwhelmed with righteous indignation and with grief at their
ingratitude. . . .
   "The sorrow of Ezra and his associates over the evils that had
insidiously crept into the very heart of the Lord's work, wrought re-
pentance. Many of those who had sinned, were deeply affected. 'The
people wept very sore.' In a limited degree they began to realize the
heinousness of sin, and the horror with which God regards it. They saw
the sacredness of the law spoken at Sinai, and many trembled at the
thought of their transgressions."—"Prophets and Kings," pp. 620, 622.
                                    8
                            THE LESSON
    1. What did God say would result from His blessings upon ancient
Israel if they would carry out His will? Deut. 28:10-13.
    2. 'What illustration of the ingathering of the strangers came to
Israel early in their conquest of Canaan? Joshua 2:8-14; 6:25.
  3. How soon after conquering Canaan did Israel begin to forget
God? Joshua 24:31; Judges 2:10-13.
    4. Because of their failure to be loyal, whom did God leave in the
land to prove Israel? Judges 2:20-23.
    NoTE.—Instead of a country wholly cleared of idolaters, as God had
at first intended, the pagan peoples who remained in Canaan became to
Israel a test of fidelity, a constant source of temptation, a snare. Yet
had Israel been faithful to the Lord, even under these conditions, He
would have made them a light to the Gentiles, and through them brought
salvation to a multitude of those who sat in darkness. Instead, almost
the whole nation constantly rebelled, broke His covenant, and trans-
gressed His laws.
    5. When the service of God was established in the temple at Jeru-
salem, how did God signalize His acceptance of His sanctuary in Israel?
2 Chron. 5:14; 7:1-3.
   6. In his prayer at the dedication of the temple, what petition did
Solomon offer for the stranger? 1 Kings 8:41-43.
     7. What experiences show that rulers and people forgot 'the evi-
dences of divine leadership? 1 Kings 11:1-8.
     NOTE.—"So gradual was Solomon's apostasy that before he was
aware of it, he had wandered far from God. Almost imperceptibly he
began to trust less and less in divine guidance and blessing, and to put
confidence in his own strength. Little by little he withheld from. God
that unswerving obedience which was to make Israel a peculiar, people,
and he conformed more and more closely to the customs of the.surround-
ing nations."—"Prophets and Kings," p. 55.
                                                                    •
     8. As a result of their departure from God, what conditions even-
tually prevailed in Israel and Judah? 1 Kings 14:21-24; 12:26-31.
     NOTE.—"From the time of Jeroboam's death to Elijah's appearance
before Ahab, the people of Israel suffered a steady spiritual decline.
Ruled by men who did not fear Jehovah and who encouraged strange
forms of worship, the larger number of the people rapidly lost sight of
their duty to serve the living God, and adopted many of the practices
 of idolatry."—Id., p. 109.
   9. When God could no longer bear with Israel's rebellions and al:04s-
tasy, what came upon them?' 2 Kings 17:5; Hosea 4:17; Amos 7:11.
   NoTE.—The Lord permitted Samaria to be invaded "by the ho4ts otf
Assyria under Shalmaneser ; and in the siege that followed, multitudes
perished miserably of hunger and disease as well as by the sword. The
city and nation fell, and the broken remnant of the ten tribes were
carried away captive, and scattered in the provinces of the' Assyrian
                                • 9
realm. . . . The Assyrians were merely the instruments that God used
to carry out His purpose. . . .
    "Not all who were carried captive were impenitent. Among them
were some who had remained true to God, and others who had humbled
themselves before Him. Through these, 'the sons of the living God,'
He would bring multitudes in the Assyrian realm to a knowledge of
the attributes of His character and the beneficence of His law."—Id.,
pp. 291, 292.
    10. As Judah failed to learn from the experience of Israel, what fate
eventually overtook them and the holy city? 2 Kings 24:10, 14; 25:8-11.
    NoTE.—"The king was even too weak to be willing that his courtiers
and people should know that he had held a conference with Jeremiah, so
fully had the fear of man taken possession of his soul. If Zedekiah had
stood up bravely and declared that he believed the words of the prophet,
already half fulfilled, what desolation might have been averted! . . .
    "The enemy swept down like a resistless avalanche, and devastated
the city. The Hebrew armies were beaten back in confusion. The nation
was conquered. Zedekiah was taken prisoner, and his sons were slain
before his eyes. The king was led away from Jerusalem a captive, his
eyes were put out, and after arriving in Babylon he perished miserably.
The beautiful temple that for more than four centuries had crowned
the summit of Mount Zion, was not spared by the Chaldeans. . . . Zion
was utterly destroyed; the people of God were in their captivity."—
Id., pp. 458-461.
    11. What promise bad been made concerning the duration of the
captivity? Jer. 29:10; 2 Chron. 36:21.
    12. In order that the prophecy might be fulfilled, whom did God
influence in behalf of Israel? Ezra 1:1-4.
    NoTE.—"Just at the time God had said He would cause His temple
at Jerusalem to be rebuilt, He moved upon Cyrus as His agent to dis-
cern the prophecies concerning himself, with which Daniel was so fa-
miliar, and to grant the Jewish people their liberty."—Id., p. 557.
   13. Under what Persian king was the promise to Jeremiah definitely
and finally fulfilled? Ezra 7:11, 21-26.
    14. Because of their past sins and their punishments, what did the
people seek to learn when they were restored to their own land? Neh.
8:1-3, 8.
    NOTE.—"Wherever Ezra labored, there sprang up a revival in the
study of the Holy Scriptures. Teachers were appointed to instruct the
people; the law of the Lord was exalted and made honorable. The books
of the prophets were searched, and the passages foretelling the coming
of the Messiah brought hope and comfort to many a sad and weary
heart. . . . Through the centuries, the record of his [Ezra's] life of
consecration has inspired many with the determination 'to seek the law
of the Lord, and to do it.' "—Id., p. 623.
   15. What followed their study of the law of God? Neh. 10:28-30.
   16. What was to be their attitude toward the Sabbath? Verse 31.
                               [10]
    17. What pledge of support did they make for the house and worship
of God? Verses 32, 33.
    NoTE.—"Provision was also made to support the public worship of
God. In addition to the tithe, the congregation pledged themselves to
contribute yearly a stated sum for the service of the sanctuary. . . .
Israel had returned to God with deep sorrow for backsliding. They had
made confession with mourning and lamentation. They had acknowl-
edged the righteousness of God's dealings with them, and had cove-
nanted to obey His law."—Id., p. 667.
    18: While binding themselves thus carefully by vows to prevent
apostasy, what weighty obligations were eventually forgotten? Matt.
23:23, 25-28.
    NOTE.—"The Pharisees were very exact in tithing garden herbs, such
as mint, anise, and rue; this cost them little, and it gave them a repu-
tation for exactness and sanctity. At the same time their useless restric-
tions oppressed the people and destroyed respect for the sacred system
of God's own appointing. They occupied men's minds with trifling
distinctions, and turned their attention from essential truths."—"The
Desire of Ages," p. 617.
    19. What was the attitude of the later Jews toward the stranger in
their midst? John 4:9; Acts 10:28.
    NoTE.—"The Jews and the Samaritans were bitter enemies, and as
far as possible avoided all dealing with each other. To trade with the
Samaritans in case of necessity was indeed counted lawful by the
rabbis; but all social intercourse with them was condemned. . . . To
ask a favor of the Samaritans, or in any way seek to benefit them, did
not enter into the thought of even Christ's disciples."—Id., p. 183.
    "The people who had been given every opportunity to understand
the truth, were without a knowledge of the needs of those around them.
No effort was made to help souls in darkness. The partition wall which
Jewish pride had erected, shut even the disciples from sympathy with
the heathen world. But these barriers were to be broken down."—Id.,
p. 400.

                            April 27, 1929
MEMORY VERSE: Ps. 21:4.
LESSON HELP: "Christ's Object Lessons," pp. 325-350 (new ed., pp. 327-354).
                         INTRODUCTION
    "All men have been bought with this infinite price. By pouring the
whole treasury of heaven into this world, by giving us in Christ all
heaven, God has purchased the will, the affections, the mind, the soul,
of every human being. Whether believers or unbelievers, all men are the
                               [ 11 ]
Lord's property. All are called to do service for Him, and for the man-
ner in which they have met this claim, all will be required to render an
account at the great judgment day."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 326.
                             THE LESSON
    1. How does the psalmist acknowledge our accountability for the
use of our time? Ps. 90:12.
    NoTE.—"Our time belongs to God. Every moment is His, and we
are under the most solemn obligation to improve it to His glory. Of no
talent He has given will He require a more strict account than of our
time."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 342.
   2. For what purpose did he desire to employ his days rightly?
Verse 17.
    3. Who is the giver of time to mankind? Ps. 91:16; 21:4.
   4. What recognition of His ownership of our time does the Lord
require of all? Ex. 20:8-10.
    5. When did God set apart the day for rest and worship? Verse 11;
Gen. 2:1-3.
    NOTE.—"In Eden, God set up the memorial of His work of creation,
in placing His blessing upon the seventh day. The Sabbath was com-
mitted to Adam, the father and representative of the whole human
family. Its observance was to be an act of grateful acknowledgment,
on the part of all who should dwell upon the earth, that God was their
creator and their rightful sovereign; that they were the work of His
hands, and the subjects of His authority. Thus the institution was
wholly commemorative, and given to all mankind."—"Patriarchs and
Prophets," p. 48.
     6. What blessing comes to those who by Sabbath observance recog
nize God's ownership of time? Ex. 31:13.
     NOTE.—The Sabbath is the sign of God's sanctifying power, and in
its true observance we indicate our faith in Him, and our knowledge of
Him as our Creator, the Giver of all, with a claim upon our time, all of
which really is His.
    7. What blessings are promised to those who recognize the Sabbath
as belonging to the Lord? Isa. 58:13, 14.
    8. What instruction is given concerning the general use of our time?
Rom. 12:11.
    NOTE.—"The value of time is beyond computation. Christ regarded
every moment as precious, and it is thus that we should regard it. Life
is too short to be trifled away. We have but a few days of probation in
which to prepare for eternity. We have no. time to waste, no time to
devote to selfish pleasure, no time for the indulgence of sin. . . .
    "Every moment is freighted with eternal consequences. We are to
stand as minutemen, ready for service at a moment's notice. The oppor-
tunity that is now ours to speak to some needy soul the word of life may
never offer again. God may say to that one, 'This, night thy, soul shall
                                   .121,
be required of thee,' and through our neglect he may not be ready. In
the great judgment day, how shall we render our account to God?"—
"Christ's Object Lessons," pp. 342, 343.
    9. What lesson did Christ seek to teach His friends in Bethany?
Luke 10:38-42.
     NOTE.—"Life is too solemn to be absorbed in temporal and earthly
matters, in a treadmill of care and anxiety for the things that are but
an atom in comparison with the things of eternal interest. Yet God has
called us to serve Him in the temporal affairs of life. Diligence in this
work is as much a part of true religion as is devotion."—Id., p. 343.
     10. What admonition is especially given to the people of these last
days? Eph. 5:16.
     NomE.—"The only way in which we can redeem our time is by making
the most of that which remains, by being coworkers with God in His
great plan of redemption."--Id., p. 342.
     11. By what parable does Jesus teach our accountability to God for
every mental and physical attainment? Matt. 25:14, 15.
     NopE.—"The talents that Christ intrusts to His church represent
especially the gifts and blessings imparted by the Holy Spirit. . . .
     "The special gifts of the Spirit are not the only talents represented
in the parable. It includes all gifts and endowments, whether original
or acquired, natural or spiritual. All are to be employed in Christ's
service. In becoming His disciples, we surrender ourselves to Him with
all that we are and have. These gifts He returns to us purified and en-
nobled, to be used.f or 'His glory in blessing our fellow men."—Id., pp.
327, 328.
     12. What course did the three servants mentioned pursue? Verses
16-18.
     13. On the lord's return, what accounting was required?. What re-
wards were given to the faithful? What punishment to the negligent?
 Verses 19-30.
     NomE.—"We shall individually be held responsible for doing one
 jot less than we have ability to do. The Lord measures with exactness
 every possibility for service. The unused capabilities are as much
 brought into account as are those that are improved. For all thaf,7e
 might become through the right use of our talents God holds us respon-
 sible. We shall be judged according to what we ought to have done, but
 did not accomplish because we did• not use our powers to glorify God.
 Even if we do not lose our souls, we shall realize in eternity the result
 of our unused talents. For all the knowledge and ability that we might
 have gained and did not, there will be an eternal loss."—Id., p: 363.
     14. How completely will true love to God absorb our faculties? How
 will this love be manifested? Mark 12:30.                             1 11
     NOTE.-Our love to God will manifest itself in the use of every .talent
 committed to us. Heart, soul, mind, and strength will be fully, conse-
 crated to Him, that we may glorify Him in our bodies and in our spirits,
 which are God's. 1 Cora 6 :20.
                                    [13 ].
    15. What reward awaits the loyal servant who consecrates all to
his Lord? Matt. 25:31-34.
    16. By what service will this loyalty of God's children have been
shown? Verses 35-40.
    NOTE.—"His [Christ's] followers are not to feel themselves detached
from the perishing world around them. They are a part of the great
web of humanity, and heaven looks upon them as brothers to sinners as
well as to saints."—"The Ministry of Healing," p. 104.
    "He who becomes a child of God should henceforth look upon him-
self as a link in the chain let down to save the world, one with Christ
in His plan of mercy, going forth with Him to seek and save the lost."
—Id., p. 105.
    "We shall find His footprints beside the sick bed, in the hovels of
poverty, in the crowded alleys of the great cities, and in every place
where there are human hearts in need of consolation."—Id., p. 106.


                             LESSON 5
     THE BLESSING OF PHYSICAL HEALTH
                            May 4, 1929
MEMORY VERSE: 1 Cor. 10:31.
LESSON HELP: "The Ministry of Healing," pp. 277-286; 295-310; 237-240.
                          THE LESSON
   1. What wish concerning our health does the Saviour express
through His servant John? 3 John 2.
    NOTE.—"The Saviour in His miracles revealed the power that is
continually at work in man's behhlf, to sustain and to heal him. Through
the agencies of nature, God is working, day by day, hour by hour, mo-
ment by moment, to keep us alive, to build up and restore us. When
any part of the body sustains injury, a healing process is at once begun;
nature's agencies are set at work to restore soundness. But the power
working through these agencies is the power of God. All life-giving
power is from Him. When one recovers from disease, it is God who
restores him."—"The Ministry of Healing," pp. 112, 113.
    2. What did God promise to do for Israel if they served Him faith-
fully? Ex. 23:25; 15:26.
   NoTE.—Exodus 15:26 includes one of the ten "Jehovah titles," in
which the name Jehovah is joined to some other great word of assurance.
Here it is "Jehovah Ropheka"—"Jehovah that healeth thee." How
preciously connected with this is what is said of Jesus: "Himself took
our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses." Matt. 8:17.
   3. To make it possible for Israel to enjoy the best of health, and to
insure them against the physical evils of surrounding nations, what
provision did God make for them?
                                 [14 1
   Answer: God gave them a code of sanitation and hygiene, which has
been a model to succeeding generations. (See Leviticus, chapters 11-15,
17; "The Ministry of Healing," pp. 277-286.)
   NOTE. "Had the Israelites obeyed the instruction they received,
and profited by their advantages, they would have been the world's
object lesson of health and prosperity. If as a people they had lived
according to God's plan, they would have been preserved from the
diseases that afflicted other nations. Above any other people they would
have possessed physical strength, and vigor of intellect. They would
have been the mightiest nation on the earth."—Id., p. 283.
   4. What resulted when Israel did obey God? Ps. 105:37.
    5. What does the psalmist say the Lord does for His people?
Ps. 103:3.
   6. While upon earth, what similar work did our Lord do for the
people? Matt. 4:23.
   7. What are our bodies said to be? What are we urged to do?
1 Cor. 6:19, 20.
   8. What will be the result of defiling God's temple? 1 Cor. 3:17.
   NoTE.—These bodies of ours should be pure and free from sin, for
they are the temples of the Holy Spirit. Man's only safety lies in sur-
rendering himself soul and body to the holding, sanctifying power
of God.
   9. Whose life and example illustrate the stand every loyal Christian
should take relative to physical health? Dan. 1:8-16.
   NoTE.—The stand taken by Daniel and his companions was not
made in defiance of the power of the king, but was taken on principle.
These young men were among the few in Israel who had been taught in
their homes to love God and to serve Him faithfully. They could not
with conscience void of offense toward God partake of the king's meat,
or drink the wine offered to them. They stood courageously for prin-
ciple, yet they won the favor of the king's servants. Steadfastness to
principle was honored by the nation's leaders, and blessed of God. The
results at the end of their three years' training were apparent in body
and in mind, for "in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the
king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the
magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm." Dan. 1:20.
    10. For what purpose do men enter into training for athletic con-
tests? How definitely will the one who gives himself to God's service
consecrate his physical powers? 1 Cor. 9:24, 25.
    11. What objective did the apostle have in mind in subjecting his
body to rigid discipline? Verses 26, 27.
    NOTE.—Paul acknowledged the fact that we all should recognize,
that acts, and not speech, doing, and not saying, are the things that
count most in life. An eloquent, forceful minister of the gospel, the
essential thing with him was to live aright, to conquer every besetting
sin, to overcome every temptation, to live so that men could read in his
                                   15
  life that he had conquered. For this reason he could say at its close,
  "I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have ,kept the
• faith." 2 Tim. 4:7. This may just as truly be said, of each of us if we
  will run the race with the same determination, seeking strength from
  the same source.
      12. How much does true temperance then include?
  Diet: Eccl. 10:17.
      NoTE.—"Those foods should be chOsen that best supply the elements
  needed for building up the body. In this choice, appetite is not a safe
  guide. Through wrong habits 'of' eating; the appetite has become per-
  verted. Often it demands food fhat'impairs health and causes Weakness
  instead of strength. We can not safely be guided by the customs of
  society. The disease and suffering that everywhere prevail are largely
  due to popular errors in regard to diet."—"The Ministry of Healing,"
  p. 295.
      If possible, read pages 295-310.
  Pure Water:
      NoTE.—"In health and in sickness, pure water is one of: Heaven's
  choicest blessings. Its proper use promotes health. It is. the beverage
 which God provided to quench the thirst of animals and man. Drunk
  freely, it helps to supply the necessities of the systeni; and assists nature
 to resist disease."—Id., p. 237.
 Fresh Air:
      NOTE.—"Impure air does not afford the necessary supply of oxygen,
 and the blood passes to the brain and other organs without being vital-
 ized. Hence the necessity of th6rough ventilation1"—Id., p. 274.
 Rest: Mark 6:31.                                    •
      NOTE.—"Chriet did not send them [His discipleS] away withdut His
 Spirit, and by faith in Him they worked many miracles; but they needed
 now to feed on the,bread of life. They needed to go to :a place of retire-
 ment, where they could hold communion with Jes*, and receive instruc-
 tion for future work. . . . Christ is full of tenderness arid compassion
 for all in His service. He would show His disciples that God doe's not
 require sacrifice, but mercy. They had been putting their whole Semis
 into labor for the people, and this was exhausting their physic's" and
 mental strength. It was their duty to rest."—"The Desire of Ages,"
 p. 360. .
 Exercise: Eccl. 5:12.                                                     •
     NoTE.—"Each faculty of the mind and each muscle has its distinc-
 tive office, and all must be equally exercised in order to become properly
 developed and to retain healthful vigor."—"Gospel Workers,", p. 238.
     "Proper periods of sleep and rest and an abundance of phyiical
 exercise are essential to health of body and mind."—Id.', p:'423.
     Read "The Ministry of Healing," pp. 237-240.              •
 Dress: 1 Peter 3 :3, 4.
     NoTE.—"Our clothing,: while modest and simple, should e of good
 quality; of becoming colors, and suited for service. It should be chosen
                                     [16]
for durability rather than display. It should provide warmth and proper
protection. . . . In all respects the dress should be healthful."—"The
Ministry of Healing," p. 288.
    Read pages 287-294. '
Mental Peace: Prov. 17:22; Matt. 11:28; John 14:27.
    NorE.—"Courage, hope, faith, sympathy, love, promote health and
prolong life. A contented mind, a cheerful spirit, is health to the body
and strength to the soul."—Id., p. 241.
    "When the sunlight of God's love illuminates the darkened chambers
of the soul, restless weariness and dissatisfaction will cease, and satis-
fying joys will give vigor to the mind, and health and energy to the
body."—Id., p. 247.
    13. What would have been the result had God's people carefully
followed His instructions? Deut. 28:2-6.
    14. What, therefore, are we all admonished to do? 1 Cor. 10:31;
Rom. 12:1.
    NOTE.—The call of the apostle is to complete consecration, with
consequent victory over every evil appetite and action. "I can do all
things through Christ which strengtheneth me" (Phil. 4:13) should be
the background of our consecrated endeavor. This surrender of our all
is only our "reasonable service" to God.


                             LESSON 6
       RETURNING OUR CHILDREN TO GOD
                            May 11, 1929
MEMORY VERSE: 1 Sam. 1:28.
LESSON HELP: "The Ministry of Healing," pp. 395-403.
                             INTRODUCTION
    "Above any other agency, service for Christ's sake in the little
things of everyday experience has power to mold the character and to
direct the life into lines of unselfish ministry. To awaken this spirit,
to encourage, and rightly to direct it, is the parent's and the teacher's
work. No more important work could be committed to them. The spirit
of ministry is the spirit of heaven, and with every effort to develop and
encourage it angels will cooperate."—"The Ministry of Healing," p. 401.
                           THE LESSON
   1. In the beginning, how did God provide companionship for man?
 Gen. 2:18, 21-24.
    2. What picture of a happy home does the psalmist draw? Ps.
128:2, 3, 6.
    NomE.—The psalmist by inspiration here draws a beautiful picture
of the godly home in which loyalty to God and love for one another
                              [17]
dominate the hearts of the family. Happy homes can produce naught
but peace. Their effect upon the entire community is felt in happiness
and peace. Such God intended should be the result of home life under
His Spirit's direction.
   3. What are our children said to be? Ps. 127:3, first clause;
Gen. 33 : 5.
    NoTE.—"Children are a heritage from the Lord, and they are to be
trained for His service. This is the work that rests upon parents and
teachers with solemn, sacred force, which they can not evade or ignore.
To neglect this work marks them as unfaithful servants; but there is a
reward when the seed of truth is early sown in the heart and carefully
tended."—"Counsels to Teachers," pp. 143, 144.
    4. How should parents bring up their children? Eph. 6:4.
    NOTE.—"Religion is love, and a religious home is one in which love
reigns. There must be love in action, love that flows out in all the home
intercourse, showing itself in a thousand little expressions of thought-
fulness, kindness, unselfishness, and gentle courtesy."—"Week-Day
Religion," J. R. Miller, p. 81.
   5. What instruction did God give anciently to His people concerning
the religious training of their children? Deut. 6:6, 7.
   6. What results are promised to follow proper early training?
Prov. 22:6.
   NOTE.—"The training that Solomon enjoins is to direct, educate,
develop. But in order for parents to do this work, they must themselves
understand the 'way' the child should go. It is impossible for parents to
give their children proper training unless they first give themselves to
God, learning of the Great Teacher lessons of obedience to His will."—
"Counsels to Teachers," p. 108.
   7. What example of careful instruction is mentioned in Paul's
epistle to Timothy? 2 Tim. 3:15.
    NOTE.—"God had commanded the Hebrews to teach their children
His requirements, and to make them acquainted with all His dealings
with their fathers. This was one of the special duties of every parent,—
one that was not to be delegated to another. In the place of stranger
lips, the loving hearts of the father and mother were to give, instruction
to their children. Thoughts of God were to be associated with all the
events of daily life. . . . Such was the training of Moses in the lowly
cabin home in Goshen; of Samuel, by the faithful Hannah; of David,
in the hill dwelling at Bethlehem; of Daniel, before the scenes of the
captivity separated him from the home of his fathers. Such, too, was
the early life of Christ at Nazareth ; such the training by which the child
Timothy learned from the lips of his 'grandmother Lois, and his mother
Eunice,' the truths of Holy Writ."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 592.
   8. What did God claim from every family in Israel? Num. 3:13.
   9. How did Hannah carry out this instruction with Samuel, her first-
born son? 1 Sam. 1:24-28.
                                183
    NoTE.—"Hannah's prayer was granted; she received the gift for
which she had so earnestly entreated. As she looked upon the child, she
called him Samuel—`asked of God.' As soon as the little one was old
enough to be separated from his mother, she fulfilled her vow. She loved
her child with all the devotion of a mother's heart; day by day, as she
watched his expanding powers, and listened to his childish prattle, her
affections entwined about him more closely. He was her only son, the
special gift of Heaven; but she had received him as a treasure conse-
crated to God, and she would not withhold from the Giver His own."—
Id., pp. 570, 571.
   10. What is said to be an essential part of a youth's training?
Lam. 3:27.
   NOTE.—Burden bearing, a sense of responsibility, should early be
taught every child. His duties about the house, the farm, the garden,
should be carefully planned for, and their execution assured. Thus only
can a child be fitted for a feeling of responsibility as it grows into man-
hood or womanhood.
    11. What are the youth admonished to do? Eccl. 12:1.
    NorE.—Do we ask, What should the youth be taught that they may
properly acknowledge and remember their Creator? The answer is
definite :
    "Teach your children that God has a claim upon all they possess, a
claim that nothing can ever cancel; whatever they have is theirs only
in trust, as a test of their obedience. Inspire them with ambition to gain
stars for their crown by winning many souls from sin to righteousness.
Money is a needed treasure ; let it not be lavished upon those who do not
need it. Some one needs your willing gifts."—"Testimonies," VoL 6,
p. 451.
    "When the dew of youth is upon them, children should be trained
how to do service for Christ. They should be taught self-denial."—
"Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel Workers," p. 218.
    Children should be trained by their parents from earliest childhood
to honor Him who has given them all things. Our children should faith-
fully pay God's tithe upon every sum received, either as pay for work
accomplished or as gifts from friends or relatives. Early they should be
taught to save, and to work for additional sums to give for the advance-
ment of God's cause. Thus they will learn to carry its burden upon their
hearts in after years.
  12. What results followed the twelve years of godly training given
Moses by his mother? Ex. 2:6-10; Heb. 11:23-26.
     13. In the time of the judges, what example do we have occhildren
 whose home training was neglected? 1 Sam. 2:12-17, 34; 3:13.
     NoTE.—"There is no greater curse upon households than to allow
 the youth to have their own way. When parents regard every wish of
. their children, and indulge them in what they know is not for their
 good, the children soon lose all respect for their parents, all regard for
 the authority of God or man, and are led captive at the will of Satan.
 The influence of an ill-regulated family is widespread, and disastrous
                                   [ 19 ]
to all society. It accumulates in a tide of evil that affects families, com-
munities, and governments."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 579.
    14. What early New Testament examples show the value of Chris-
tian training upon children? Luke 1:80; 2:40, 49-52.
     15. What should every parent be able to say in the last great day?
Heb. 2:13, last part.
     NOTE.—"The education and training of their children to be Chris-
tians is the highest service that parents can render to God. It is a work
that demands patient labor, a lifelong diligent and persevering effort.
By a neglect of this trust we prove ourselves unfaithful stewards. No
excuse for such neglect will be accepted by God. But those who have
been guilty of neglect, are not to despair. The woman whose coin was
lost searched until she found it. So in love, faith, and prayer let parents
work for their households, until with joy they can come to God saying,
Behold, I and the children whom the Lord bath given me.' "—"Christ's
Object Lessons," pp. 195, 196.
     16. That our children may be fully prepared for the Lord's service,
what should we daily be doing? Isa. 28:9, 10.
     Nom—Day by day, morning, noon, and night, God places in the
hands of fathers and mothers the opportunity for teaching their chil-
dren. Line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a
little, the lessons should be given by parents, for they stand in God's
place to their little ones. Teaching by life and example as well as by
precept will develop Christian character, and will fit for service in the
cause of Christ.
    17. What promise is given of a precious experience drawing parents
and children together in the last days? .How should parents relate them-
selves through their children to the giving of the closing message?
Mal. 4:5, 6.
    NOTE.—"Every son and daughter of God is called to be a mission-
ary; we are called to the service of God and our fellow men; and to fit
us for this service should be the object of our education.
    "This object should ever be kept in view by Christian parents and
teachers. We know not in what line our children may serve. They may
spend their lives within the circle of the home; they may engage in life's
common vocations, or go as teachers of the gospel to heathen lands; but
all are alike called to be missionaries for God, ministers of mercy to
the world."—"The Ministry of Healing," p. 395.

CHRIST THE WAY TO SACRIFICE AND SERVICE
               May 18, 1929
MEMORY VERSE: Matt. 20:28.
LESSON HELP: "The Ministrybf Healing," pp. -17-28.
                           INTRODUCTION
    "Never was there such an evangelist as Christ. He was the Majesty
of heaven, but He humbled Himself to take our nature, that He might
meet men where they were. To all people, rich and poor; free and bond,
Christ, the Messenger of the covenant, brought the tidings of salva-
tion. His fame as the Great Healer spread throughout Palestine. The
sick came to the places through which He would pass, that they might
call on Him for help. Hither, too, came many anxious to hear His words
and to receive a touch of His hand. Thus He went from city to city,
from town to town, preaching the gospel and healing the sick,—the
King of glory in the lowly garb of humanity."—"The Ministry of
Healing," p. 22.
                             THE LESSON
    1. What impelled God to send His Son into the world as man's Sav-
iour? John 3:16.
    2. With what spirit did Christ undertake the great task committed
to Him? Phil, 2:6, 7.
    NOTE.—The American Revised Version, margin, reads: "Who, ex-
isting in the form of God, counted not the being on an equality with
God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a
bondservant, becoming in the likeness of men.".
    3. How great was the sacrifice that Heaven made in behalf of hu-
manity in the gift of Christ? 1 John 4:9.
    NoTE.—"It was a costly sacrifice that the Lord of heaven made.
Divine benevolence was stirred to its unfathomable depths; it was im-
possible for God to give more."—"TestimoniesrVol. 9, pp. 59, 60.
    "As this wonderful, priceless Gift was bestowed, the whole heavenly
universe was mightily stirred, in an effort to understand God's unfath-
omable love, stirred to awaken in human hearts a gratitude proportion-
ate to the value of the Gift."—"Testimonies," Vol. 7, p. 29.
     4. What is the expressed desire of Christ as voiced by the psalmist?
Ps. 40:8.
                                            ,
     5. In coming to this world, whit material ch.ange,came into Christ's
life? 2 Cor. 8:9.
     NOTE.—"You know the height from which. He stooped; the depth of
 humiliation to which. He descended. Kis feet entered upon the path of
 sacrifice, and turned not aside until Efe had given His life. There was
 no rest for Him between the throne in heaven and the cross. His love
 for man led Him to welcome every indignity, and suffer every abuse."
 —"The Ministry of Healing," p. 501.
                                   [217
    6. From the teaching of the Master, what do we learn concerning the
acceptance of the same spirit of sacrifice? Matt. 19:21.
    NOTE.—"At the Saviour's call, John, Peter, Matthew, and their com-
panions 'left all, rose up, and followed Him.' The same consecration
was required of the young ruler. And in this Christ did not ask a greater
sacrifice than He Himself had made. . . . The young man had only to
follow where Christ led the way."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 393.
    "Jesus did not consider heaven a place to be desired while we were
lost. He left the heavenly courts for a life of reproach and insult, and
a death of shame. He who was rich in heaven's priceless treasure became
poor, that through His poverty we might be rich. We are to follow in
the path He trod."—"The Ministry of Healing," p. 105.
    7. In His love and willing sacrifice, what did Christ become to man-
kind? Phil. 2:7; John 13:15-17.
    NoTE.—"In His life and lessons, Christ has given a perfect exempli-
fication of the unselfish ministry which has its origin in God. God does
not live for Himself. By creating the world, and by upholding all things,
He is constantly ministering for others. 'He maketh His sun to rise on
the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.'
This ideal of ministry God has committed to His Son. Jesus was given
to stand at the head of humanity, that by His example He might teach
what it means to minister. His whole life was under a law of service.
He served all, ministered to all. Thus He lived the law of God, and by
His example showed how we are to obey it."—"The Desire of Ages,"
p. 649.
    8. While among men, what did Christ seek to do for their welfare?
What made this possible? Acts 10:38.
    NOTE.—"Our Lord Jesus Christ came to this world as the unwearied
servant of man's necessity. He 'took our infirmities, and bare our sick-
nesses,' that He might minister to every need of humanity. . . . It was
His mission to bring to men complete restoration ; He came to give them
health and peace and perfection of character."—"The Ministry of Heal-
ing," p. 17.
  9. After Jesue,baptism what message did He give to Israel? What
                         '
message were the twelve instructed to give? Matt. 4:17; 10:7, 8.
  10. From earliest youth, what was His attitude toward His mission?
Luke 2:49.
    11. What does He say He came into the world to do? Matt. 20:28.
    NOTE.—"All day He ministered to those who came to Him; in the
evening He gave attention to such as through the day must toil to earn
a pittance for the support of their families. Jesus carried the awful
weight of responsibility for the salvation of men."—Id., p. 18.
    "Christ gave no stinted service. He did not measure His work by
hours. His time, His heart, His soul and strength, were given to labor
for the benefit of humanity. Through weary days He toiled, and through
long nights He bent in prayer for grace and endurance that He might
do a larger work. . . . To His workers He says, have given you an
example, that ye should do as I have done' "—Id., p. 500.
                                  [ 223
    12. In thus giving Himself to the service of God, whose will was He
carrying out? John 6:38; 4:34.
     13. When the time of His supreme sacrifice drew near, what was His
attitude? John 12:27; Matt. 26:39; Phil. 2:8.
     NOTE.—The Saviour had come to the moment of great agony in Geth-
semane. The burden of the world's sin He was bearing in His person.
He was about to die for the lost. Of that moment it is said, "He has left
the courts of heaven, where all is purity, happiness, and glory, to save
the one lost sheep, the one world that has fallen by transgression. And
He will not turn from His mission. He will become the propitiation of
a race that has willed to sin. His prayer now breathes only submission:
'If this cup may not pass away from Me, except I drink it, Thy will be
done.' "—"The Desire of Ages," p. 693.
     14. According to the prophet Isaiah, how great was the price of
Calvary to be? For whom was it paid? Isa. 53:3-6.
     15. What reward was to come to the Saviour as the result of His
patient endurance of the cross? Heb. 12:2; Isa. 53:11.
     16. What should His disciples learn from His example? 1 Peter 2:21.
     NoTE.—"Through trial and persecution the glory—the character—
of God is revealed in His chosen ones. The believers in Christ, hated and
persecuted by the world, are educated and disciplined in the school of
Christ. On earth they walk in narrow paths; they are purified in the
 furnace of affliction. They follow Christ through sore conflicts; they
 endure self-denial, and experience bitter disappointments; but thus they
 learn the guilt and woe of sin, and they look upon it with abhorrence.
 Being partakers of Christ's sufferings, they can look beyond the gloom
 to the glory, saying,    reckon that the sufferings of this present time
 are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in
 us.' "—"The Acts of the Apostles," pp. 576, 577.


                             LESSON 8
               TO A LOST WORLD—GO YE
                            May 25, 1929
MEMORY VERSE: Isa. 49:6, last part.
LESSON HELPS: "Gospel Workers," pp. 24-29; "Christ's Object Lessons,"
pp. 296-303 (new ed., pp. 300-308).                               -
                           INTRODUCTION
    "Men are in peril. Multitudes are perishing. But ho*.few of the
professed followers of Christ are burdened for these souls. The destiny
of a world hangs in the balance but this hardly moves even these who
claim to believe the most far-reaching truth ever given, to Mertals. . .
With the whole world before them :in need of the .g0ipel, profesSed
Christians congregate together where they themselves can enjoy gospel
                                  [ 23 ]
privileges. They do not feel the necessity of occupying new territory,
carrying the message of salvation into regions beyond. They refuse to
fulfill Christ's commission, 'Go ye into all the world, and preach the
gospel to every creature.' Are they less guilty than was the Jewish
churcht"—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 303.
                              THE LESSON
   1. How does the prophet Isaiah describe the condition of the world?
Isa. 60:2, first part.
    2. In what condition is every soul who has not found the Saviour?
Eph. 2:12.
    NOTE.—Every soul that has found the Saviour and has had his life
transformed by His power came out of dense spiritual darkness. Re-
gardless of the nationality, race, or privileges of the individual, in spite
of educational advantages, or positions of preferment in this world, no
man has the light that shines brighter and brighter unto the perfect
day until he has entered into the presence of Christ and found Him the
Saviour of his soul. Then there is shed abroad in his heart a light and
joy and hope not to be found elsewhere. Until that hour it is darkness
such as Paul describes,—"Having no hope, and without God in the
world."
   3. What does Christ desire that His followers should, do for the
world in its darkness? Matt. 5:14-16.
    4. What command was given to the apostles in Paul's day? Acts
13:47.
    NOTE.—This verse is quoted from the words of Isaiah 49:6. The
gospel prophet saw Paul's day. He saw the Israel of God filling their
appointed place in God's great plan for men. Paul, recognizing his own
part in the commission given to God's people, set the example of carry-
ing the light to the great Gentile, or unsaved, world.
   5. While with His disciples in person, what work did the Saviour
give them? Matt. 10:1, 5-8.
    6. How were they to obtain their support while in the field? Verses
9, 10.
    NOTE.—Not by supernatural provision, but by the gifts of those
blessed by their ministry were they to be sustained in their toil.
    7. What were they to expect as a part of their experience? Verses
16-24.
    NomE.—"The Saviour's eye penetrates the future; He beholds the
broader fields in which, after His death, the disciples are to be witnesses
for Him. His prophetic glance takes in the experience of His servants
through all the ages till He shall come the second time. He shows His
followers the conflicts they must meet; He reveals the character and
plan of the battle. He lays open before them the perils they must en-
counter, the sel.f-denial that will be required. He desires them.to count
the cost, that they may not be taken unawares by the enemy. . • . They
are to contend with supernatural forces, but they are assured of super-
                                     243
natural help. All the intelligences of heaven are in this army. And more
than angels are in the ranks. The Holy Spirit, the representative of the
Captain of the Lord's host, comes down to direct the battle. Our in-
firmities may be many, our sins and mistakes grievous; bUt the grace
of God is for all who seek it with contrition. The power of Omnipotence
is enlisted in behalf of those who trust in God."—"The Desire of Ages,"
p. 352.
    8. Just before His ascension, what command did Jesus give to all
His disciples? To make the carrying out of this command possible,
whose power and presence were promised? Matt. 28:18720.
    NOTE.--"To you, My disciples, I [Jesus] commit this _message of.
mercy. It is to be given to Israel first, and then to all nations, tongues,
and peoples. It is to be given to Jews and. Gentiles. .A.11 who believe are
to be gathered into one church.
    "Through the gift of the Holy Spirit the disciples were to' receive a
marvelous power. Their testimony was to be confirmed, by signs and
wonders. Miracles would be wrought, not only by the apostles, but by
those who received their message. [Mark 16:17, 18.]"—Id:; .p: 821.
    9. Where was their witness to begin? HoW far was it to extend?
Acts' 1:8.
    10. What results followed the first preaching of the gospel by the
apostolic church? Acts 2:41; 4:4.
    11. What conditions did God allow to dome upon the chUrch? With
what result? Acts 8:1, 4.
    12. When Paul was converted, to what work was he set apart by the
Lord? What would come to him in connection with this service? Acts
9:15, 16.
    NoTE.—"At the time of Paul's conversion, the Lord had declared
that he was to be made a minister to the Gentiles, 'to open their eyes,
and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan
unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance
among them which are sanctified by faith that is in Me.' . . . And Paul
himself, later in his Christian experience, while praying in the' temple
at Jerusalem, had been visited by an angel from heaven, who bade him,
'Depart:' for 1 will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles.'
    "Thus the Lord had given Paul his commission to enter the broad
missionary field of the Gentile world. To prepare him for this extensiiie
and difficult work, God had brought him into close connection with
Himself, and had opened before his enraptured vision views of the
beauty and glory of heaven."—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 159'.'
    Paul was called to no easy task. The succeeding years were filled
with arduous labors, suffering, and privation, which were ended only by
his death..Of those experiences we read, "Amidst the: constant stornqif
opposition, the clamor of, enemies, and the. desertion of friends; the
intrepid apostle almost iost heart. But he looked back to CalvarSr, and
with new ardor pressed on to spread the knowledge of the Cruci#K He
was but treading the blood-stained path that Christ had trodden before
                                    [25 1
him. He sought no discharge from the warfare till he should lay off
his armor at the feet of his Redeemer."—Id., p. 297.
    13. What testimony did Paul give at the close of his years of faith-
ful ministry? 2 Tim. 4:6-8.
    NOTE.—This testimony of the aged, war-worn apostle is presented
by "The Acts of the Apostles," page 513, in these words: "Well-nigh a
score of centuries have passed since Paul the Aged poured out his blood
as a witness for the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ. No
faithful hand recorded for the generations to come the last scenes in the
life of this holy man; but Inspiration has preserved for us his dying
testimony. Like a trumpet peal his voice has rung out through all the
ages since, nerving with his own courage thousands of witnesses for
Christ, and wakening in thousands of sorrow-stricken hearts the echo of
his own triumphant joy."
    A faithful servant of Jesus Christ, living His life of service and
self-sacrifice, Paul stands preeminent among those who have accepted
the command of Jesus, "Go ye into all the world." Well may we, in
emulation of the aged apostle, give ourselves in faithful ministry that
we may be among those who with him will share the crown of glory.
   14. What promises are given for the encouragement of all faithful
ministers of Christ? Isa. 43:5-7; 49:6, 12.


                             LESSON 9
     THE LABORER WORTHY OF HIS HIRE
                             June 1, 1929
MEMORY VERSE: Mal. 3:10.
LESSON HELP: "Testimonies," Vol. 3, pp. 381-408.
                             INTRODUCTION
    "We are to praise God by tangible service, by doing all in our power
to advance the glory of His name. God imparts His gifts to us that we
also may give, and thus make known His character to the world. Under
the Jewish economy, gifts and offerings formed an essential part of
God's worship. The Israelites were taught to devote a tithe of all their
income to the service of the sanctuary. Besides this they were to bring
sin offerings, free-will gifts, and offerings of gratitude. These were the
means for supporting the ministry of the gospel for that time. God
expects no less from us than He expected from His people anciently.
The great work for the salvation of souls must be carried forward. In
the tithe, with gifts and offerings, He has made provision for this work.
Thus He intends that the ministry of the gospel shall be sustained. He
claims the tithe as His own, and it should ever be regarded as a sacred
reserve, to be placed in His treasury for the benefit of His cause. He
asks also for our free-will gifts and offerings of gratitude. All are to
be devoted to the sending of the gospel unto the uttermost parts of the
earth."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 300.
                                     26
                          THE LESSON
   1. In what words does Christ indicate that the gospel worker should
be properly sustained? Matt. 10:10, last part.
   2. To whom do all things belong? Ps. 24:1. (See also Ps. 50:10-12.)
   3. What part of one's income has the Lord claimed as His? Lev.
27:30.
   4. How did Abraham acknowledge the ownership of God and his
obligations to Him? Gen. 14:17-20.
    5. Under what circumstances did Jacob recognize a similar obliga-
tion? Gen. 28:20-22.
    NoTE.—"The tithing system did not originate with the Hebrews.
From the earliest times the Lord claimed a tithe as His; and this claim
was recognized and honored. Abraham paid tithes to Melchizedek, the
priest of the most high God. Jacob, when at Bethel, an exile and a wan-
derer, promised the Lord, 'Of all that Thou shalt give me I will surely
give the tenth unto Thee.' As the Israelites were about to be established
as a nation, the law of tithing was reaffirmed as one of the divinely
ordained statutes upon obedience to which their prosperity depended."
—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 525.
    6. After Israel was delivered from Egyptian bondage, what definite
commands were given concerning their payment of tithe? Lev. 27:30-34.
    NorE.—"The system of tithes and offerings was intended to impress
the minds of men with a great truth,—that God is the source of every
blessing to His creatures, and that to Him man's gratitude is due for
the good gifts of His providence."—Ibid.
    7. In what other way were the claims, of God to be acknowledged
by His people? Ex. 23:19, first part; Prov. 3:9.
    NOTE.—"Even before the tithe could be reserved, there had been an
acknowledgment of the claims of God. The first that ripened of every
product of the land, was consecrated to Him. The first of the wool when
the sheep were shorn, of the grain when the wheat was threshed, the
first of the oil and the wine, was set apart for God. So also were the
first-born of all animals. . . .
    "Thus the people were constantly reminded that God was the true
proprietor of their fields, their flocks, and their herds; that He sent
them sunshine and rain for their seedtime and harvest, and that every-
thing they possessed was of His creation, and He had made them
stewards of His goods."—Id., p. 526.
    8. What resulted when on one occasion the children of Israel failed
to bring in the tithe to the Lord's treasury? Neh. 13:10.
   1\ToTE.—The Levites were compelled to take up agriculture for their
own support, owing to the withholding of the tithes of Israel. Whenever
the tithe is withheld, the ministry must earn a livelihood by other means,
thus forcing a neglect of the teaching of God's word in the church and
hindering the advancement of the knowledge of God into all the world.
   9. How was this neglect then corrected? Verses 11, 12.
                                ( 27 3
    10. What other requirement of God that acknowledged His owner-
ship was being neglected at the same time? Verses 15-18.
    NOTE.—Due to their contact with the idolatrous nations among
which they had dwelt and with whom they had to some extent inter-
mingled, the temple service and its support had been neglected, and the
people had grown careless in their observance of the Sabbath. These
two signs—the tithe, an acknowledgment of God's ownership of all
things, and the Sabbath, the sign of His control of our time and His
sanctifying power upon His people—had been relegated into partial
oblivion. Satan seeks unceasingly to veil all that will help God's children
to remember their Creator; and emphasizes those things which will
eclipse Christ, with His saving power and grace.
   11. What resulted in Haggai's day from neglect of support for the
house of God? What followed the loyal action of Israel? Haggai
1:7-11. ; 2:18, 19.
    12. Of what are God's people accused by the Lord through the
prophet Malachi? Mal. 3:8, 9.
    13. What does God invite them to do? What is the result of obedi-
ence and faithfulness in returning to God His own? Verses 10-12.
    NOTE.—"As the Giver of every blessing, God claims a certain por-
tion of all we possess. This is His provision to sustain the preaching of
the gospel. And by making this return to God, we are to show our appre-
ciation of His gifts. But if we withhold :from Him that which is His
own, how can we claim His blessing? If. we are unfaithful stewards of
earthly things, how can we expect Him to intrust us with the things of
heaven? It may be that here is the secret of unanswered prayer."-,:
"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 144.
    14. How did Christ • recognize the obligation to pay tithe? Matt.
23:23.
    NOTE.—Christ here.approves of the paying of tithes, commending
the people for their. diligence in being faithful to every, detail..
condemns, h'o*ever, their dependence upon this. for salvation or.. for
God's approval, while proving disloyal in the great moral, virtues that
must be manifest in the life of every true Christian.
    15. What principle does the apostle Paul set forth' concerning the
support of laborers? What is said .of the support of those who minister
the word of God? 1 Cor.
   16. How great a task has been committed to those who preach the
gospel? Matt. 28:18-20.
    NOTE.—"Very precious to God is His work in the earth. Christ and
heavenly angels arc watching it every moment. As we dra near to the
coming of Christ, more and still more Of miSsioliary work' will engage
our efforts. the message of the renewing power of God's grace will
be carried to every country•and.:clime, 'until" the truth shall belt the
world. Of the number of them that shall be sealed will be those who have

every country will be gathered men and women who will stand before
the throne of God and before the Lamb."—"Counsels to Teachers,"
p. 532.
    17. What would be the result if all God's children paid a faithful
tithe?
    NoTE.—"If the plan of systematic benevolence [now tithes and
offerings] were adopted by every individual, and fully carried out,
there would be a constant supply in the treasury. The income would
flow in like a steady stream constantly supplied by overflowing springs
of benevolence."—"Testimonies," Vol. 3, pp. 389, 390.
    "If systematic benevolence were universally adopted according to
God's plan, and the tithing system carried out as faithfully by the
wealthy as it is by the poorer classes, there would be no need of repeated
and urgent calls for means at our large religious gatherings. There has
been a neglect in the churches of keeping up the plan of systematic
benevolence, and the result has been an impoverished treasury and a
backslidden church."—Id., p. 409.
    "If our churches will take their stand upon the Lord's word, and be
faithful in paying their tithe into His treasury, more laborers will be
encouraged to take up ministerial work. More men would give them-
selves to the ministry were they not told of the depleted treasury. There
should be an abundant supply in the Lord's treasury, and there would
be if selfish hearts and hands had not withheld the tithes, or made use
of them to support other lines of work."—"Testimonies," Vol. 9, p. 249.
    18. In the message of the first angel, how is God's ownership of the
world definitely acknowledged? Rev. 14:7.
    NoTE.—The call of this message is to an acknowledgment of the
Creator. It calls upon men to give Him glory, and to fear Him;: in
preparation for the hour of judgment. This will lead to obedience; to
fullness of loyalty and devotion. It will cause every one who accepts
the message to acknowledge God's ownership of all,—His just claim
upon our money, our time, our talents, our bodily health and strength,
and of our children, for He made them. In devoting them to His work
of making Him known to the world as the Creator, we are but return-
ing to Him His own.
    19. What will be the attitude of the remnant church toward all God's
requirements? Verse 12.
    NoTE.—"In the time of the end, every divine institution is to be
restored. The breach made in the law at the time the Sabbath was
changed by man, is to be repaired. God's remnant people; standing
before the world as reformers, are •to show that the law of God is the
foundation of all enduring reform, and that the Sabbath of the fourth
commandment is to stand as a memorial of creation, a constant re-
minder of the power of God. In clear, distinct lines they are to present
the necessity of obedience to all the precepts of the Decalogue. Jon-
strained by the love of Christ, they are to cooperate with Him' in build-
ing up the waste places. They are to be repairers of the breach; restorers
of paths to dwell in."—"Prophets and Kings," p. 678.

                              LESSON 10
     A TEST OF LOYALTY AND DEVOTION—
             HOLDING THE ROPES
                             June 8, 1929
MEMORY VERSE: Luke 12:48.
LESSON HELP: "Testimonies," Vol. 3, pp. 408-413.
                            INTRODUCTION
    "All who have borne with Jesus the cross of sacrifice, will be sharers
with Him of His glory. It was the joy of Christ in His humiliation and
pain, that His disciples should be glorified with Him. They are the
fruit of His self-sacrifice. The outworking in them of His own character
and spirit, is His reward, and will be His joy throughout eternity. This
joy they share with Him, as the fruit of their labor and sacrifice is seen
in other hearts and lives. They are workers together with Christ, and
the Father will honor them as He honors His Son."—"The Desire of
Ages," p. 624.
                            THE LESSON
   1. What test did the Lord provide to prove the loyalty of our first
parents? Gen. 2:16, 17; 3:3.
    NoTE.—"At the very beginning of man's existence a check was
placed upon the desire for self-indulgence, the fatal passion that lay
at the foundation of Satan's fall. The tree of knowledge, which stood
near the tree of life in the midst of the garden, was to be a test of the
obedience, faith, and love of our first parents. While permitted to eat
freely of every other tree, they were forbidden to taste of this, on pain
of death. They were also to be exposed to the temptations of Satan;
but if thy endured the trial, they would finally be placed beyond his
power, to enjoy perpetual favor with God."—"Patriarchs and Proph-
ets," pp. 48, 49.
    2. How was Joseph tested, that he might be fitted for heavy respon-
sibilities? Gen. 37:28; 39:20; 41:41-45.
    NOTE.—Of Joseph's trials and afflictions we are told: "God was
preparing him, in the school of affliction, for greater usefulness, and he
did not refuse the needful discipline." He was tested, tried, refined, his
life purified, that he might render the greater service fof God. Every
trial that we are called upon to endure, every sacrifice that we are called
upon to make, is but the preparatory school for greater usefulness.
   3. What test came into the life of Moses? What great decision was
made? Heb. 11:23-26.
   4. What task has been assigned to the church of Christ in these last
days? Mark 16:15.
   5. For the accomplishment of this work, what did the Saviour teach
would be necessary? Luke 5:10, 11; 18:22, 23.
                                (30]
    6. How did the apostolic church carry out this principle in the
spreading of the gospel message? Acts 4:31-37.
    NOTE.—"This liberality on the part of the believers was the result
of the outpouring of the Spirit. The converts to the gospel were 'of one
heart and of one soul.' One common interest controlled them,—the suc-
cess of the mission intrusted to them; and covetousness had no place in
their lives. Their love for their brethren and the cause they had es-
poused was greater than their love of money and possessions. Their
works testified that they accounted the souls of men of higher value than
earthly wealth."—"The Acts of the Apostles," pp. 70, 71.
  7. What is one of the outstanding dangers to the followers of Christ?
What admonition has He given? Luke 12:15, 33.
   8. What, rather, ought His people to seek? Where will their hearts
be centered? Verses 31, 34.
  9. What will God do for those whose hearts are fully surrendered to
Him? Verse 32.
   10. In making our choice for Christ and His service, what should be
considered? Luke 14:26, 27.
   11. What two illustrations does the Saviour use to enforce the les-
son? Verses 28-32.     •
   NorE.—The Saviour can accept no partial obedience. He who loves
father or mother, sister or brother, more than Christ, is not worthy of
Him. Christ must come first. We should count the cost when choosing
His service. Choosing Him, our all must go with the choice. We must
be prepared to battle through to victory. The promise is to those who
forsake all to take Him: "He shall receive an hundredfold now in this
time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and
lands, with persecutions ; and in the world to come eternal life." We
need to count the cost, but it is worth all the sacrifice.
    12. What conclusion is drawn? Verse 33.
   13. What is the basic principle on which God expects us to give for
the extension of His cause? Luke 12:48; Matt. 10:8, last clause.
    NOTE.—"As our blessings and privileges are increased,—above all,
as we have before us the unparalleled sacrifice of the glorious Son of
God,—should not our gratitude find expression in more abundant gifts
to extend to others the message of salvation? The work of the gospel,
as it widens, requires greater provision to sustain it than was called
for anciently; and this makes the law of tithes and offerings of even
more urgent necessity now than under the Hebrew economy."—"Patri-
archs and Prophets," pp. 528, 529.
    14. What is the divine standard for individual giving? 1 Cor. 16:2.
    15. Lest we should at any time forget the world's need, what are we
 urged to do? John 4:35; Luke 10:2.
   16. What will our vision of the harvest field and our prayers for
 workers lead us to do? Acts 16:9, 10.
                                   31 1
    NOTE.—"From all countries the Macedonian cry is sounding, 'Come
over and help us.' God has opened fields before us, and if human agen-
cies would but cooperate with divine agencies, many, many souls would
be won to the truth. But the Lord's professing people have been sleeping
over their allotted work, and in many places it remains comparatively
untouched."—"Testimonies," Vol. 9, p. 46.
    "Our church members should feel a deep interest in home and foreign
missions. Great blessings will come to them as they make self-sacrificing
efforts to plant the standard of truth in new territory."—Id., p. 49.
   "The small sums saved by deeds of sacrifice will do more for the
upbuilding of the cause of God than larger gifts will accomplish that
have not called for denial of self."—"Counsels on Health," p. 131.
    17. What is required of all stewards, whether intrusted with worldly
goods or with positions of responsibility in service? 1 Cor. 4:1, 2.
    NOTE.—"We are pilgrims and strangers, seeking a better country,
and every soul should make a covenant with God by sacrifice. The time
for saving souls is short, and whatever is not needed in supplying posi-
tive necessities, should be brought as a thank offering to God."—"Gos-
pel Workers," p. 454.
    "The Lord designs that the means intrusted to us shall be used in
building up His kingdom."—"Testimonies," Vol. 6, p. 448.
    "If there was ever a time when sacrifices should be made, it is now.
Those who have money should understand that now is the time to use
it for God."—Id., p. 450.
    "Teach your children that God has a claim upon all they posses, a
claim that nothing can ever cancel; whatever they have is theirs only in
trust, as a test of their obedience."—Id., p. 451.


                             LESSON 11
 THE BLESSINGS DERIVED FROM FAITHFUL
             STEWARDSHIP
                            June 15, 1929
MEMORY VERSE: 2 Cor. 8:12.
LESSON HELP: "Christ's Object Lessons," pp. 390-404 (new ed., pp. 397-413).
                            INTRODUCTION
    "However short our service or humble our work, if in simple faith
we follow Christ, we shall not be disappointed of the reward. That which
even the greatest and wisest can not earn, the weakest and most humble
may receive. Heaven's golden gate opens not to the self-exalted. It is
not lifted up to the proud in spirit. But the everlasting portals will
open wide to the trembling touch of a little child. Blessed will be the
recompense of grace to those who have wrought for God in the sim-
plicity of faith and love."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 404.
                                   32
                               THE LESSON
     1. In the building of the sanctuary in the wilderness, what spirit
was necessary on the part of those who gave the materials? Ex. 25:2.
     2. In the time of the judges, what did the same spirit lead the people
to do? Judges 5:2.
     3. On what basis is our service and sacrifice acceptable to God?
What alone commends our service to Him? 2 Cor. 8:12.
     NOTE.—"It is not the length of time we labor, but our willingness
and fidelity in the work, that makes it acceptable to God. In all our
service a full surrender of self is demanded. The smallest duty done in
sincerity and self-forgetfulness, is more pleasing to God than the great-
est work when marred with self-seeking. He looks to see how much of
the spirit of Christ we cherish, and how much of the likeness of Christ
our work reveals. He regards more the love and faithfulness with which
we work than the amount we do."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 402.
     4. What is said of him who sows sparingly? Bountifully? How
should one give? Upon whom is the love of God placed? 2 Cor. 9:6, 7.
     5. How bountifully has God given both temporal and spiritual bless-
ings to His earthly children? Verses 9-11.
     6. What instruction does the apostle Paul command Timothy to give
to those who are blessed with this world's goods? 1 Tim. 6:17, 18.
     7. By following this counsel, for what are they preparing? Verse 19.
     NOTE.—"God desires us to choose the heavenly in place of the
earthly. He opens before us the possibilities of a heavenly investment.
He would give encouragement to our loftiest aims, security to our
choicest treasure. He declares, will make a man more precious than
 fine gold; even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir.' When the riches
 that moth devours and rust corrupts shall be swept away, Christ's fol-
 lowers can rejoice in their heavenly treasure, the riches that are imper-
 ishable. . . . Then let your property go beforehand to heaven. Lay up
 your treasure beside the throne of God. Make sure your title to the
 unsearchable riches of Christ."—Id., pp. 374, 375.
     8. What did Paul say to the Philippians concerning his own experi-
 ence? Phil. 4:15-17.
      9. What kindness shown to the apostle Paul did he say was "well
 pleasing" to God? Of what was Paul assured for them? Verses 18, 19.
      10. With what parable did Jesus illustrate God's dealing with His
 workers? Matt. 20:1.
      11. What was the reward promised to the first laborers hired?
  Verse 2.
      12. What promise did the householder make to those called at the
  third, sixth, and ninth hours? Verses 3-5.
      13. At the eleventh hour whom did he find in the market place?
  What arrangement did He make with them? Verses 6, 7.
                                      33
    14. When the time of rewards came, what procedure did the house-
holder follow? How much did each receive? What complaint was made?
Verses 8-12.
    15. What reply did the householder make? Verses 1346.
    NoTE.—"The first laborers of the parable represent those who, be-
cause of their services, claim preference above others. They take up
their work in a self-gratulatory spirit, and do not bring into it self-
denial and sacrifice. They may have professed to serve God all their
lives; they may have been foremost in enduring hardship, privation,
and trial, and they therefore think themselves entitled to a large reward.
They think more of the reward than of the privilege of being servants
of Christ. In their view their labors and sacrifices entitle them to receive
honor above others, and because this claim is not recognized, they are
offended."—Id., pp. 399, 400.
    16. In what way will the saints of God have made a covenant with
the Lord? Ps. 50:5.
    NomE.—"0, how different are the standards by which God and men
measure character. God sees many temptations resisted of which the
world, and even near friends, never know,—temptations in the home, in
the heart. He sees the soul's humility in view of its own weakness; the
sincere repentance over even a thought that is evil. He sees the whole-
hearted devotion to His service. He has noted the hours of hard battle
with self,—battle that won the victory. All this God and angels know.
A book of remembrance is written before Him for them that fear the
Lord and that think upon His name."—Id., pp. 403, 404.
    17. What will be the reward of all who have willingly and loyally
consecrated their all to Christ's service? Rom. 2:6, 7; Rev. 22:12.
    NoTE.—"There are many who have given themselves to Christ, yet
who see no opportunity of doing a large work or making great sacrifices
in His service. These may find comfort in the thought that it is not
necessarily the martyr's self-surrender which is most acceptable to God;
it may not be the missionary who has daily faced danger and death,
that stands highest in heaven's records. The Christian who is such in
his private life, in the daily surrender of self, in sincerity of purpose
and purity of thought, in meekness under provocation, in faith and
piety, in fidelity in that which is least, the one who in the home life
represents the character of Christ,—such a one may in the sight of God
be more precious than even the world-renowned missionary or martyr."
—Id., p. 403.
    18. Of what was the apostle Paul assured as he neared the close of
his ministry? To how many is the same assurance given? 2 Tim. 4:8.
    NOTE.—"The one who stands nearest to Christ will be he who on
earth has drank most deeply of the spirit of His self-sacrificing love,—
love that ‘vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, . . . seeketh not her
own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil,'—love that moves the
disciple, as it moved our Lord, to give all, to live and labor and sacrifice,
even unto death, for the saving of humanity."—"The Desire of Ages,"
p. 549.
                                   [34]
    19. What do those become who accept of the salvation bought by the
blood of Jesus? 2 Cor. 6:1, first clause.
    NoTE.—God's eternal gift of love and life in redeeming us; the eter-
nal gratitude which we must ever owe to Him; the binding, drawing
power of His infinite love,—all these blessings ought to make us grate-
ful, willing partners with Him in His labor and travail for lost humanity.


                             LESSON 12
     THE GIFT OF THE HOLY SPIRIT; GOD'S
           ASSURANCE OF VICTORY
                            June 22, 1929
MEMORY VERSE: Eph. 4: 13.
LESSON HELP: "The Acts of the Apostles," pp. 47-56.

                            INTRODUCTION
   "All who consecrate soul, body, and spirit to God, will be constantly
receiving a new endowment of physical and mental power. The inex-
haustible supplies of heaven are at their command. Christ gives them
the breath of His own spirit, the life of His own life. The Holy Spirit
puts forth its highest energies to work in heart and mind. The grace of
God enlarges and multiplies their faculties, and every perfection of the
divine nature comes to their assistance in the work of saving souls.
Through cooperation with Christ they are complete in Him, and in their
human weakness they are enabled to do the deeds of Omnipotence."—
"The Desire of Ages," p. 827.
                              THE LESSON
   1. What struggle is constantly going on in the hearts and lives of
men? Gal. 5:17.
    NOTE.—"It is through false theories and traditions that Satan gains
his power over the mind. By directing men to false standards, he mis-
shapes the character. Through the Scriptures the Holy Spirit speaks to
the mind, and impresses truth upon the heart. Thus He exposes error,
and expels it from the soul. It is by the Spirit of truth, working through
the word of God, that Christ subdues His chosen people to Himself."—
"The Desire of Ages," p. 671.
   2. In His desire for man's salvation, what has ever been God's atti-
tude? Eph. 2:4, 5.
   NoTE.God's love for His children has ever been manifest in His
desire for their salvation. His love emptied heaven in our behalf, and
centered the eyes of the universe on the conflict raging between good
and evil on earth. All creation awaited the outcome of God's plan for
man's redemption in the sacrifice of His only-begotten Son. Calvary is
the evidence of a love unsurpassed.
                                  [ 35 ]
    3. As God seeks for a dwelling place in the hearts of His children,
what part have we to perform? Rev. 3:20.
    NoTE.—The Saviour "is not repulsed by scorn or turned aside by
 threatening, but continually seeks the lost ones, saying, 'How shall I
give thee upl' Although His love is driven back by the stubborn heart,
He returns to plead with greater force, 'Behold, I stand at the door, and
knock.' "—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 235.
    4. By what means does God approach the hearts of men? John
16:7, 8.
    5. What does the Holy Spirit do for the believer? Into what will He
lead us? John 14:26; 16:13.
    6. What change will result from the coming of the Spirit into our
hearts? Eze. 36:26, 27.
    NOTE.—"The Holy Spirit was the highest of all gifts that He could
solicit from His Father for the exaltation of His people. The Spirit was
to be given as a regenerating agent, and without this the sacrifice of
Christ would have been of no avail. The power of evil had been strength-
ening for centuries, and the submission of men to this satanic captivity
was amazing. Sin could be resisted and overcome only through the
mighty agency of the third Person of the Godhead, who would come with
no modified energy, but in the fullness of divine power. It is the Spirit
that makes effectual what has been wrought out by the world's Re-
deemer. It is by the Spirit that the heart is made pure. Through the
Spirit the believer becomes a partaker of the divine nature. Christ has
given His Spirit as a divine power to overcome all hereditary and culti-
vated tendencies to evil, and to impress His own character upon His
church."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 67L
    7. Upbn what occasion did Jesus explain the mystery of being born
of the Spirit? To what did He liken it? John 3:1-8.
    8. What need did David recognize in his life? With what earnest
words did he plead for the Spirit? Ps. 51:10-12.
    9. How fully will the Holy Spirit take possession of our lives if we
yield to Him? What will He do for us? What shall we then be able to
comprehend? Eph. 3:16-19.
    NOTE.—The Holy Spirit, admitted to the human heart, brings not
only cleansing from sin but unmeasured power for the "inner man,"
where Christ by His Spirit has come to dwell.
    10. As the result of such a surrendered life, what will God develop
in us? Eph. 4:13.
    NOTE.—This reference definitely states that the gifts of the Spirit
are given for the purpose of developing in the church the full stature of
Jesus Christ,—a church measuring to His standard in character, service,
sacrifice, that the work of God may be accomplished and a people made
ready for our Lord's return.
    11. What are we counseled against doing? Verse 30.
                                  [ 36]
   NOTE.—We "grieve" the Holy Spirit by our sins, our carelessness,
our indifference, our neglect of duty. (See verses 25-32.)
     12. What was the result of the outpouring of the Spirit upon the
 early church? Acts 4:4, 31, 32; 6:3, 8; 8:1, 4.
     NoTE.—"What was the result of the outpouring of the Spirit on the
 day of Pentecost' The glad tidings of a risen Saviour were carried to
 the uttermost parts of the inhabited world. As the disciples proclaimed
 the message of redeeming grace, hearts yielded to the power of this
_message. The church beheld converts flocking to her from all directions.
Backsliders were reconverted. Sinners united with believers in seeking
the pearl of great price. Some who had been the bitterest opponents of
the gospel became its champions.... Every Christian saw in his brother
a revelation of divine love and benevolence. One interest prevailed; one
subject of emulation swallowed up all others. The ambition of the
believers was to reveal the likeness of Christ's character, and to labor
for the enlargement of His kingdom."—"The Acts of the Apostles,"
p. 48.
   13. Of what was this the fulfillment? Joel 2:28, 29.
    14. What may we expect in these days just before the great ingath-
ering? Verse 23, last clause.
    NOTE.—"Near the close of earth's harvest, a special bestowal of
spiritual grace is promised to prepare the church for the coming of the
Son of man. This outpouring of the Spirit is likened to the falling of
the latter rain; and it is for this added power that Christians are to
send their petitions to the Lord of the harvest 'in the time of the latter
rain.' "—Id., p. 55.
    15. What will be the result to the church? Acts 1:8.
    NOTE.—"Every worker who follows the example of Christ will be
prepared to receive and use the power that God has promised to His
church for the ripening of earth's harvest. Morning by morning, as
the heralds of the gospel kneel before the Lord and renew their vows
of consecration to Him, He will grant them the presence of His Spirit,
with its reviving, sanctifying power. As they go forth to the day's
duties, they have the assurance that the unseen agency of the Holy
Spirit enables them to be 'laborers together with God.' "—Id., p. 56.
    16. What invitation will the Spirit give through God's witnesses?
When will this be given? Rev. 22:17, 20.
    NoTE.—"Every one who hears is to repeat the invitation. What-
ever one's calling in life, his first interest should be to win souls for
Christ. He may not be able to speak to congregations, but he can work
for individuals. . .
    "The disciples were to begin their work where they were. The hard-
est and most unpromising field was not to be passed by. So every one of
Christ's workers is to begin where he is. In our own families may be
souls hungry for sympathy, starving for the bread of life. There may
be children to be trained for Christ. There are heathen at our very doors.
Let us do faithfully the work that is nearest.. Then let our efforts be
                                    C371
extended as far as God's hand may lead the way."—"The Desire of
Ages," p. 822.
    "The command, 'Go ye into all the world,' is not to be lost sight of.
We are called upon to lift our eyes to the 'regions beyond.' Christ tears
away the wall of partition, the dividing prejudice of nationality, and
teaches a love for all the human family. He lifts men from the narrow
circle which their selfishness prescribes; He abolishes all territorial lines
and artificial distinctions of society. He makes no difference between
neighbors and strangers, friends and enemies. He teaches us to look
upon every needy soul as our brother, and the world as our field."—
Id., p. 823.


                             LESSON 13
     TRIUMPH FOR THOSE WHO COVENANT

                            INTRODUCTION
    "Fellow pilgrim, we are still amid the shadows and turmoil of earthly
activities; but soon our Saviour is to appear to bring deliverance and
rest. Let us by faith behold the blessed hereafter, as pictured by the
hand of God. He who died for the sins of the world, is opening wide
the gate of Paradise to all who believe on Him. Soon the battle will
have been fought, the victory won. Soon we shall see Him in whom our
hopes of eternal life are centered. And in His presence the trials and
sufferings of this life will seem as nothingness. The former things 'shall
not be remembered, nor come into mind.' Cast not away therefore your
confidence, which hath great recompense of reward. For ye have need
of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive
the promise. For yet a little while, and He that shall come will come,
and will not tarry.' Israel shall be saved . . . with an everlasting sal-
vation: ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world without end."
—"Prophets and Kings," pp. 731, 732.
                              THE LESSON
   1. To what may all the world look forward in the very near future?
Ps. 50:3, 4.
    NomE.—The hour is near when the Son of God shall return, and call
home His faithful people. To them it will be an hour of joyful triumph
(Isa. 25:8, 9), but to the disobedient a moment of awful fear (Rev.
6:14-17).
   2. Who will be called in that day? What has been one of their out-
standing characteristics? Ps. 50:5.
                                 (38]
     3. How fully will they have consecrated their all to the service of the
Master? What promise has been made to them? Mark 10:28-30.
     NOTE.—Every one of the "called" in that day will have been among
those who have given their all. In service, time, money, comforts, home,
wherever or whatever their service or life for Christ may have demanded,
they will have known the true spirit of sacrifice. Each will have entered
into the life and spirit of the blessed Master.
     4. In forsaking all, what do God's children confess concerning this
present world? Heb. 11:13.
     5. To what are they looking forward? Verse 14.
     6. Because of their faith and trust, what is God preparing for them?
Verse 16.           •
     7. Where will this city prepared for the saints be established?
Whence does the city come? 2 Peter 3:13; Rev. 21:1, 2.
     NOTE.—"In the earth made new, the redeemed will engage in the
occupations and pleasures that brought happiness to Adam and Eve in
the beginning. The Eden life will be lived, the life in garden and field.
... There every power will be developed, every capability increased. The
grandest enterprises will be carried forward, the loftiest aspirations will
be reached, the highest ambitions realized. And still there will appear
new heights to surmount, new wonders to admire, new truths to com-
prehend, fresh objects of study to call forth the powers of body and
mind and soul."—"Prophets and Kings," pp. 730, 731.
     8. What pictures. does the prophet Isaiah draw of the saints' in-
heritance? Isa. 65:17, 21-25; 11:6-9.
     9. Who only will be permitted to partake of the joys of the new
earth? Rev. 22:14; 21:7, 27.
     10. What general statement indicates the nature of the influences
over which complete victory must be gained by the overcomer? 1 John
2:16.
     11. By what means is overcoming made possible? 1 John 5:4.
     NOTE.—Those who "overcome" gain the victory over the world, the
flesh, and the devil. That victory can be gained only through faith in
Christ. We can not do it of ourselves. He who overcomes surrenders
all, and, like his Master, is wholly given to doing the will of Him that
sent him. There will be no reservations in such surrender, service, or
sacrifice.
     12. Through whom does this victory come to us? 1 Cor. 15:57;
Rom. 8:37.
     13. What fullness of consecration is demanded of the overcomer?
 Rev. 12:11.
     NOTE.—Those who overcome in this conflict win because they are
 willing to consecrate all, even life itself, to the Master. Only so is it
 possible to triumph in the conflict to-day. All for Christ now is the
 standard as surely as at any time in earth's history.
                                    [ 39 ]
