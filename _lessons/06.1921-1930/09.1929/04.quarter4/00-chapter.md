Beginning Our Work in Kweiyang, Kweichow
  [Shortly after this article by Brother H. K. Smith was written, he was killed by
  bandits. Brother Smith was director of the East Kweichow Mission, 'China.]
    E HAVE been having good crowds at our Sabbath services. In the
W  beginning we had the children memorize memory texts; if they could
repeat the texts, we gave them a Memory Verse Card. We had to follow
this plan, for we did not have enough of the cards to go around.
    One boy about eight years old came four Sabbaths and memorized
the four memory texts; then he brought his older sister, who is a student
in the Kweiyang Normal School. She has been here three Sabbaths, and
has bought a Bible and a songbook; we hope she may accept the message.
We also have several young men studying the truth.
    One Sabbath Mrs. Lee had thirty-one children from eight to twelve
years of age in her class. They are a bright crowd of boys and girls. We
hope soon to open a primary school-
    We are in the midst of a strong evangelistic effort in Kweiyang. The
city is divided into four parts for our work, and our purpose is to call at
every home and leave a tract: After three weeks of this house-to-house
work, we plan to hold a three weeks' institute, studying the truth with
interested ones and training colporteurs. Already some are calling on
us as the result of our passing out tracts. Our greatest need is a chapel,
as our present room is not large enough to hold the Sabbath crowds.
    Kweiyang is a very beautiful Chinese city, and is blessed with ninny
kinds of fruit and vegetables. It is already quite modern. Automobiles
pass our place several times during the day and night.
    Pray that we shall have wisdom and power to put the right mold on
the work here iu its beginning.

                        An Explanation
    In view of the fact that nearly all adults are familiar with the lives
of leading characters in Old Testament history, it has not been deemed
necessary to follow these stories in all their details in making the ap-
plication of Old Testament experiences to our needs to-day. Tile stu-
dent should, therefore, study the scriptures referred to so as to get the
practical thoughts without snaking an attempt to follow the complete
narrative. Find the answer to the question asked in the Quarterly, then
apply the practical lesson to your own life. Teachers should stress the
lessons to be learned rather than the details of the experiences. Careful,
prayerful consideration of the prominent incidents in Old Testament
times will enrich the experience of God's children to-day.



                Lesson 1—October 5, 1929
              THE FAITH OF ABRAHAM
MEMORY VERSE: Gal. 3:29.
LESSON HELP: "Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 125-131, 145-155 (new ed., pp.
   119-125, 141-151).
MAP STUDY: Locate the places mentioned in the lesson.
                              THE LESSON
   1. What was God's call to Abraham? Gen. 12:1-3.
    NOTE.—Abraham's father "served other gods" (Joshua 24:2), and
Abraham, dwelling at Ur, had grown up in the midst of heathenism.
Abraham, however, steadfastly worshiped the true God.
    2. What account is given of the first stage of Abraham's journey to
the land of Canaan? Gen. 11:31, 32.
    3. What is still the call of God to His people? 2 Cor. 6:17; Rev.
18:4.
    4. How did Abraham show his trust and confidence in God? Gen.
12:4, 5.
    NOTE.—"Many are still tested as was Abraham. They do not hear
the voice of God speaking directly from the heavens, but He calls them
by the teachings of His word and the events of His providence. They
may be required to abandon a career that promises wealth and honor, to
leave congenial and profitable associations, and separate from kindred,
to enter upon what appears to be only a path of self-denial, hardship,
and sacrifice."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 126, 127.
    5. When Abraham came into the land of Canaan, what promise did
 God make to him? What custom did Abraham follow in his worship of
the Creator? Verses 6-8.
    NOTE.—"Abraham, 'the friend of God,' set us a worthy example. His
was a life of prayer. Wherever he pitched Isis tent, close beside it was
                                   [3]
set up his altar, calling all within his encampment to the morning and
the evening sacrifice. When his tent was removed, the altar remained.
In following years, there were those among the roving Canaanites who
received instruction from Abraham; and whenever one of these came to
that altar, he knew who had been there before him; and when he had
pitched his tent, he repaired the altar, and there worshiped the living
God."—Id., p. 128.
    6. Although he had proinptly obeyed God's commands, how did
Abraham reveal his human weakness? Answer: By losing faith in God's
keeping power, and practicing deceit. Verses 10-20.
    NOTE.—Abraham's weakness is again shown in the experiences re-
corded in Genesis 20. "During his stay in Egypt, Abraham gave evi-
dence that be was not free from human weakness and imperfection. In
concealing the fact that Sarah was his wife, he betrayed a distrust of
the divine care, a lack of that lofty faith and courage so often and nobly
exemplified in his life. . . . No deviation from strict integrity can meet
God's approval."—Id., p. 130.
      7. When assailed by fears concerning the fulfillment of God's prom-
ise, how was Abraham reassured? Gen. 15:1-6.
      NOTE.—Abraham's "mind was so oppressed by forebodings that he
could not now grasp the promise with unquestioning confidence as here-
tofore. He prayed for some tangible evidence that it would be fulfilled.
. . . Then he was led outside his tent, and told to look up to the unnum-
bered stars glittering in the heavens; and as he did so, the words were
spoken, 'So shall thy seed be.' Abraham believed God, and it was
counted unto him for righteousness.' "—Id., pp. 136, 137.
  8. How did Abraham and Sarah seek to carry out in their own wis-
dom God's plan for them? Gen. 16:1-3, 15.
    9. What were the results of thus interfering with God's plan for,
them? Answer: Jealousy, quarreling and harsh treatment for Hagar,
with ultimate banishment from the home. Gen. 16:4-6; 21:9-14.
    NOTE.—"The instruction given to Abraham, touching the sacredness
of the marriage relation, was to he a lesson for all ages. It declares that
the rights and happiness of this relation are to be carefully guarded,
even at a great sacrifice. Sarah was the only true wife of Abraham. Her
rights as a wife and mother, no other person was entitled to share. She
reverenced her husband, and in this she is presented in the New Testa-
ment as a worthy example. But she was unwilling that Abraham's af-
fections should be given to another; and the Lord did not reprove 1,er
for requiring the banishment of her rival. Both Abraham and Sarah
distrusted the power of God, and it was this error that led to the mar-
riage with Hagar."—Id., p. 147.
    10. What definite assurance did God give Abraham and Sarah of
the birth of an heir? Gen: 17:1-4, 15-21.
   11. What was the age of Abraham and of Sarah when Isaac was
born? Gen. 17:17; 21:1-5.
                              E41
     12. How was the faith of Abraham tested when Isaac was about
twenty years of age? Gen. 22:1-6.
     NOTE.—"God had called Abraham to be the father of the faithful,
:nd his life was to stand as an example of faith to succeeding genera-
tions. But his faith had not been perfect. He had shown distrust of God
    concealing the fact that Sarah was his wife, and again in his marriage
with Hagar. That he might reach the highest standard, God subjected
him to another test, the closest which man was ever called to endure. In
a vision of the night he was directed to repair to the land of Moriah, and
there offer up his son as a burnt offering upon a mountain that should
be shown him. At the time of receiving this command, Abraham had
reached the age of a hundred and twenty years."—Ibid.
     13. What in this experience shows that Isaac possessed the living
faith of his father? Answer: His humble submission to his aged father.
Verses 7-10.
     NOTE.—"It was with terror and amazement that Isaac learned his
fate; but he offered no resistance. He could have escaped his doom, had
he chosen to do so; the grief-stricken old man, exhausted with the strug-
gle of those three terrible days, could not have opposed the will of the
vigorous youth. But Isaac had been trained from childhood to ready,
trusting obedience, and as the purpose of God was opened before him,
he yielded a willing submission. He was a sharer in Abraham's faith,,
and he felt that he was honored in being called to give his life as an
offering to God."—Id., p. 152.
     14. Of what was this example of faith a type? Verses 6, 8, 13.
     NOTE.—"The ram offered in the place of Isaac represented the Son
of God, who was to be sacrificed in our stead. . . . It was to impress
Abraham's mind with the reality of the gospel, as well as to test his
faith, that God commanded him to slay his son. The agony which he en-
dured during the dark days of that fearful trial, was permitted that he
might understand from his own experience something of the greatness
of the sacrifice made by the infinite God for man's redemption. No other
test could have caused Abraham such torture of soul as did the offering
of his son. God gave His Son to a death of agony and shame. . . . The
sacrifice required of Abraham was not alone for his own good, nor
solely for the benefit of succeeding generations; but it was also for the
instruction of the sinless intelligences of heaven and of other worlds.
. . . God desired to prove the loyalty of His servant before all heaven,
to demonstrate that nothing less than perfect obedience can be accepted,
and to open more fully before them the plan of salvation."—Id., pp.
154, 155.
     15. After this test of Abraham's faith, what message of assurance
did God again give him? Verses 15-18.
     16. What is said of the death of Abraham? How old was he? Gen.
25 : 7-10.
      17. What had God said that He knew concerning Abraham? In
speaking to Isaac, how did He commend Abraham's with and con.
stancy? Gen. 18:19; 26:3-5.
                                    [5 1
    NorE.—"His own example, the silent influence of his daily life, was
a constant lesson. The unswerving integrity, the benevolence and un-
selfish courtesy, which had won the admiration of king& were displayed
in the home. There was a fragrance about the life, a nobility and loveli-
ness of character, which revealed to all that he was connected with
Heaven."—Id., p. 142.
    18. How are we made sharers in the promise made to Abraham?
Gal. 3:29.
    NOTE.—"The promises made to Abraham are to be fulfilled through
Christ. . . . Those who are children of Abraham will be seeking the
city which he looked for, 'whose builder and maker is God.' "—Id.,
p. 170.
                       MEDITATION TOPICS
    What were strong characteristics in the character of Abraham?
    What message does Abraham's life preach to the people of to-day?
    What personal experiences in my life do I recognize as tests?



              Lesson 2—October 12, 1929
LOT PITCHED HIS TENT TOWARD SODOM
MEMORY VERSE: Rom. 12:10.
LESSON HELP: "Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 132-136; 156-169 (new ed.,
    pp. 127-132, 153-164).
                           INTRODUCTION
   "It is a heavy responsibility for godly people to live amid scenes of
notorious godlessness and sin. If they escape the snare, their children
may be caught in it. What right have we heedlessly to expose young
lives to foul miasma, which may taint and defile them forevermore!
And if through the claims of duty we are compelled to live in any such
baleful and noxious atmosphere, let us ask that the fire of divine purity
may extend like a cordon of defense around our home; and that our
dear ones may dwell in the secret place of the Most High."—F. B.
Meyer.
                             THE LESSON
    1. Of all Abraham's relatives in Haran, who only is stated to have
journeyed with him to Canaan? Gen. 12:4, 5.
  2. In the journey out of Egypt, who again accompanied Abraham?
Gen. 13:1.
   3. What was the eventual cause of Lot's separation from Abraham?
What noble attitude did Abraham take in this time of difficulty?
Verses 5-9.
   NOTE.—"Here the noble, unselfish spirit of Abraham was displayed.
How many, under similar circumstances, would, at all hazards, cling to
their individual rights and preferences! How many households have
                                 [ 61
thus been rent asunder! How many churches have been divided, making
the cause of truth a byword and a reproach among the wicked! . . . The
cultivation of a uniform courtesy, a willingness to do to others as we
would wish them to do to us, would annihilate half the ills of life. The
spirit of self-aggrandizement is the spirit of Satan; but the heart in
which the love of Christ is cherished, will possess that charity which
seeketh not her own."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 132, 133.
    4. What unfortunate choice did Lot make? Verses 10-13.
    NOTE.—"Although Lot owed his prosperity to his connection with
Abraham, he manifested no gratitude to his benefactor. Courtesy would
have dictated that he yield the choice to Abraham; but instead of this,
he selfishly endeavored to grasp all its advantages. . . . The most fer-
tile region in all Palestine was the Jordan valley, reminding the be-
holders of the lost Paradise, and equaling the beauty and productive-
ness of the Nile-enriched plains they had so lately left. There were
cities also, wealthy and beautiful, inviting to profitable traffic in their
crowded marts. Dazzled with visions of worldly gain, Lot overlooked
the moral and spiritual evils that would be encountered there. . . . How
little did he foresee the terrible results of that selfish choice!"—Id.,
p. 133.
    5. What assurance came to Abraham following this demonstration
of his unselfishness? Verses 14-18.
   6. From what perilous situation did Abraham rescue Lot after his
location in the plain of the Jordan? Answer: From bondage after the
capture of Sodom by the four kings. Gen. 14:1-3, 10-16.
    7. Following the battle, what recognition did Abraham make of
God's ownership? Verses 17-20.
    NoTE.—"The tithing system reaches back beyond the days of Moses.
Men were required to offer to God gifts for religious purposes before
the definite system was given to Moses, even as far back as the days of
Adam. In complying with God's requirements, they [men] were to
manifest in offerings their appreciation of His mercies and blessings
to them. This was continued through successive generations, and was
carried out by Abraham, who gave tithes to Melehizedec, the priest of
the Most High God. . . . God does not compel men to give. All that
they give must be voluntary. He will not have His treasury replenished
with unwilling offerings."—Testimonies, vol. 3, p. 393.
    8. In what environment was Lot living? Gen. 13:12; 14:12.
    NOTE.—"Pitching one's tent toward Sodom. (1) Any wrong or self-
ish act, unforsaken, will naturally draw us toward evil. (2) There are
great outward attractions to many sins. They are like Oriental cities,
shining with marble and gold in the distance, but within they are full
of all manner of vileness. (3) The approach to great sins is gradual.
The innocent never rush into them at once, but are gradually drawn on;
their repulsion is overcome little by little. 'They first endure, then pity,
then embrace.' (4) He who keeps bad company pitches his tent toward
Sodom. (5) He who indulges in doubtful pleasures pitches his tent
                                   [7I
toward Sodom. (6) He who pitches his tent toward Sodom will probably
soon find himself in the city. (7) The only safe way is to keep as far
from sin and as near to God as possible."—Peloubet.
    9. By whom was Abraham visited? Upon what mission of destruc-
tion were the angels sent? Gen. 18:1-5, 16-22.
    10. What was the sin of Sodom that demanded its destruction?
Ezek. 16:49, 50.
    NoTE.—"There is nothing more desired among men than riches and
leisure, and yet these gave birth to the sins that brought destruction
upon the cities of the plain. Their useless, idle life made them a prey
to Satan's temptations, and they defaced the image of God, and be-
came satanic rather than divine. Idleness is the greatest curse than can
fall upon man; for vice and crime follow in its train."—"Patriarchs
and Prophets," p. 156.
   11. How did Abraham plead for the inhabitants of the wicked city?
With what success? Gen. 18:23-33.
    12. When the two angels came to Sodom on their errand of destruc-
tion, who met and entertained them? Gen. 19:1-3.
    NOTE.—"There was one man who manifested kindly attention
toward the strangers, and invited them to his home. Lot did not know
their true character, but politeness and hospitality were habitual with
him; they were a part of his religion,—lessons that he had learned from
the example of Abraham. Had he not cultivated a spirit of courtesy,
he might have been left to perish with the rest of Sodom. Many a
household, in closing its doors against a stranger, has shut out God's
messenger, who would have brought blessing and hope and peace."—
Id., p. 158.
    13. What did the men of Sodom demand of Lot concerning his
guests? When Lot went out to reason with them, how did they treat
him? How was Lot protected? Verses 4-11.
    NOTE.—"That last night was marked by no greater sins than many
others before it; but mercy, so long slighted, had at last ceased its
pleading. The inhabitants of Sodom had passed the limits of divine
forbearance,—`the hidden boundary between God's patience and His
wrath.' The fires of His vengeance were about to be kindled in the vale
of Siddim."—Id., p. 159.
   14. What command was given to Lot by the angels? How did the
sons-in-law respond? Verses 12-14.
    15. How urgently did the angels hasten Lot and his family out of
the city? By what final request did Lot indicate his reluctance to leave
city surroundings? Verses 15-22.
    NOTE.—"Stupefied with sorrow, he [Lot] lingered, loath to depart.
But for the angels of God, they would all have perished in the ruin of
Sodom. The heavenly messengers took him and his wife and daughters
by the hand, and led them out of the city. Here the angels left them,
                                  [8 l
and turned back to Sodom to accomplish their work of destruction.
Another—He with whom Abraham had pleaded—drew near to Lot.
. . . The command was given with startling vehemence: 'Escape for
thy life; look not behind thee; . . . escape to the mountain, lest thou
be consumed.' Hesitancy or delay now would be fatal. To cast one lin-
gering look upon the devoted city, to tarry for one moment, from regret
to leave so beautiful a home, would have cost their life. The storm of
divine judgment was only waiting that these poor fugitives might make
their escape."—Id., pp. 160, 161.
   16. Due to disobedience, what punishment fell upon Lot's wife?
Verse 26.
   NOTE.—"One of the fugitives ventured to cast a look backward to
the doomed city, and she became a monument of God's judgment. If
Lot himself had manifested no hesitancy to obey the angel's warning,
but had earnestly fled toward the mountains, without one word of
pleading or remonstrance, his wife also would have made her escape.
The influence of his example would have saved her from the sin that
sealed her doom. But his hesitancy and delay caused her to lightly re-
gard the divine warning. While her body was upon the plain, her heart
clung to Sodom, and she perished with it."—Id., p. 161.
    17. As Lot entered Zoar, what doom fell on Sodom and Gomorrah?
Verses 23-25.
    18. Why was Lot spared in the destruction of the cities of the plain?
Where eventually, because of fear, did Lot take up his abode? Verses
27-30.
    NOTE.—"Lot dwelt but a short time in Zoar. Iniquity prevailed
there as in Sodom, and he feared to remain, lest the city should be de-
stroyed. Not long after, Zoar was consumed, as God had purposed. Lot
made his way to the mountains, and abode in a cave, stripped of all for
which he had dared to subject his family to the influence of a wicked
city."—Id., p. 167.
    19. When will the experience of this lesson be repeated? What are
we told to remember? Luke 17:28-30, 32.
    NOTE.—"The flames that consumed the cities of the plain shed their
warning light down even to our time. We are taught the fearful and
solemn lesson that while God's mercy bears long with the transgressor,
there is a limit beyond which men may not go on in sin. When that
limit is reached, then the offers of mercy are withdrawn, and the minis-
tration of judgment begins."—Id., pp. 162, 165.
                        MEDITATION TOPICS
    How does this lesson teach the value of prayer?
    What connection is there between Matthew 5:13 and this lesson?
    Why did Lot "linger"? Why did his sons-in-law "mock" at his
solemn message?
    Why did his wife "look back"?
                                  [91
               Lesson 3—October 19, 1929
                     JACOB AND ESAU
MEMORY VERSE: Gal. 6:7.
LESSON HELP: "Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 177-182 (new ed., pp. 175-181).

                            INTRODUCTION
    In the lives of Jacob and Esau are illustrated the experiences of
many Christians. In Jacob's case he eventually was victor over his old
self-seeking spirit, and became Israel, a prince with God. Esau "repre-
sents those who lightly value the redemption purchased for them by
Christ, and are ready to sacrifice their heirship to heaven for the perish-
able things of earth. Multitudes live for the present, with no thought
or care for the future."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 181.
                              THE LESSON
    1. What employment did the sons of Isaac adopt as they grew to
manhood? What was the attitude of their parents toward them? Gen.
25:27, 28.
    NOTE.—When a parent shows a preference for one child of the fam-
ily, he destroys the faith and confidence of the other children in himself,
and prepares the child thus favored for a life of self-seeking. Where,
as in the case before us, father and mother are not agreed, strife, and
eventual suffering, hatreds, and separations, are certain to develop. Ab-
solute impartiality alone brings right results in the development of the
family.
   2. What early experience in the lives of these sons illustrates the
inherited and cultivated tendencies of each? Verses 29-34.
   NoTE.—Esau was tempted because of his temporary physical dis-
comfort to regard carelessly the sacred birthright; but in his heart this
indifferent attitude toward sacred things had long been cherished.
    3. What special blessings and responsibilities were counted the nat-
ural rights of the first-born son?
    NoTE.—"The promises made to Abraham and confirmed to his son,
were held by Isaac and Rebekah as the great object of their desires and
hopes. With these promises Esau and Jacob were familiar. They were
taught to regard the birthright as a matter of great importance, for it
included not only an inheritance of worldly wealth, but spiritual pre-
eminence. He who received it was to be the priest of his family; and
in the line of his posterity the Redeemer of the world would come. On
the other hand, there were obligations resting upon the possessor of the
birthright. He who should inherit its blessings must devote his life
to the service of God. Like Abraham, he must be obedient to the divine
requirements. In marriage, in his family relations, in public life, he
must consult the will of God."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 177, 178.
                                   (10]
    4. How was Esau's careless attitude toward his spiritual relations
and his parents' wishes again demonstrated? Gen. 26:34, 35.
    5. As Isaac, blind and growing old, looked forward to death, what
arrangements did he make to give Esau the birthright blessing? Gen.
27:1-4.
    6. Who had overheard this conversation? What plan was devised
that would bring the blessing to Jacob? Verses 6-13.
    7. On Jacob's return with the kids from the flock, what detailed
preparation did Rebekah make for the deception of Isaac? Verses 14-17.
    8. How fully did Jacob carry out the instruction of his mother?
Verses 18-27.
    9. With what words did Isaac bestow the parental blessing upon
Jacob? Verses 28, 29.
    10. What occurred when Esau came into the presence of his father?
Verses 30-36.
    11. On Esau's earnest plea, what blessing did Isaac bestow upon
him? Verses 37-40.
    NOTE.—"Esau was not shut out from the privilege of seeking God's
favor by repentance; but he could find no means of recovering the birth-
right. His grief did not spring from conviction of sin; he did not de-
sire to be reconciled to God. He sorrowed because of the results of his
sin, but not for the sin itself."—Id., p. 181.            •
    12. As the result of Jacob's deception, what did Esau say in his
heart? How did Rebekah arrange to divert disaster? What reason did
she give to Isaac for the plan she had in mind? Verses 41-46.
    13. With what counsel did Isaac send away Jacob? Gen. 28:1-5.
    14. Since Esau knew his father was not pleased with his marriages
to the daughters of Canaan, what course did Esau now pursue? Verses
6-9.
    15. How did the deception of Rebekah and Jacob react upon them-
selves?
    NoTE.—"Jacob had sinned, and had deeply suffered. Many years of
toil, care, and sorrow had been his since the day when his great sin
caused him to flee from his father's tents. A homeless fugitive, sepa-
rated from his mother, whom he never saw again."—Id., p. 237.
    16. How is Esau referred to in the Scriptures? Heb. 12:16.
    NOTE.—"Because of his indifference to the divine blessings and re-
quirements, Esau is called in Scripture 'a profane person.' He repre-
sents those who lightly value the redemption purchased for them by
Christ, and are ready to sacrifice. their heirship to heaven for the perish-
able things of earth. Multitudes live for the present, with no thought
or care for the future. . . . As Esau awoke to see the folly of his rash
exchange when it was too late to recover his loss, so it will be in the day
of God with those who have bartered their heirship to heaven for selfish
gratifications."—Id., pp. 181, 182.

         Lesson 4—October 26, 1929
     JACOB THE SUPPLANTER BECOMES
       ISRAEL, A PRINCE WITH GOD
MEMORY VERSE: Gen. 32:28.
LESSON HELP: "Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 183-206, 237, 238 (new ed., pp.
   183-205, 236-238).
MAP STUDY: Locate the places mentioned in the lesson.
                            INTRODUCTION
   "Jacob's character was purified by tremendous discipline. . . . He
stands among the peers in the kingdom of sorrow; and through it all
he passed into a•peerage of moral and spiritual power, which made the
mightiest monarch of his times bend eagerly for a blessing from his
trembling hand."—"Israel: A Prince With God," Meyer, p. 12.
                             THE LESSON
   1. For what place did Jacob start when he left his home? Gen. 28:
2, 10.
    2. What promise made to Abraham and to Isaac was renewed to
Jacob? What further promise was made? Verses 11-15.
    3. On awaking, what were Jacob's feelings? What memorial did
he erect there? What vow did he mgke before God? Verses 16-22.
    NOTE.—"Jacob was not here seeking to make terms with God. The
Lord had already promised him prosperity, and this vow was the out-
flow of a heart filled with gratitude for the assurance of God's love
and mercy. Jacob felt that God had claims upon him which he must
acknowledge, and that the special tokens of divine favor granted him
demanded a return. So does every blessing bestowed upon us call for
a response to the Author of all our mercies."—"Patriarchs and Proph-
ets," p. 187.
    4. When Jacob arrived at his destination, how did he become ac-
quainted with his uncle's people? How was he received by his mother's
family? Gen. 29:1-14.
    5. During Jacob's stay with his Uncle Laban to whom was he mar-
ried? Verses 15-30.
                                    12
    6. At the end of fourteen years, what request did Jacob make?
Gen. 30:25, 26.
    7. Because of the blessings that Jacob had brought into the family,.
what request was made by Laban? What arrangement was entered into?
Verses 27-36.
    8. When Jacob had served Laban twenty years, what command
came from God to him? Gen. 31:3.
    NomE.—"Jacob would have left his crafty kinsman long before, but
for the fear of encountering Esau. Now he felt that he was in danger
from the sons of Laban, who, looking upon his wealth as their own, might
endeavor to secure it by violence. He was in great perplexity and dis-
tress, not knowing which way to turn. But mindful of the gracious
Bethel promise, he carried his case to God, and sought direction from
Him. In a dream his prayer was answered: 'Return unto the land of
thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.'"—Id., p. 193.
    9. After consulting with his wives, what did Jacob immediately
decide to do? As Laban pursued, what message did he receive from
God? Verses 17-24.
    NomE.—"After three days, Laban learned of their flight, and set
forth in pursuit, overtaking the company on the seventh day of their
journey. He was hot with anger, and bent on forcing them to return,
which he doubted not he could do, since his band was much the stronger.
The fugitives were indeed in great peril. That he did not carry out his
hostile purpose was due to the fact that God Himself had interposed for
the protection of His servant. . . . Laban had withheld the marriage
dowry of his daughters, and had ever treated Jacob with craft and
harshness."—Ibid.
    10. What covenant was finally entered into between them? Answer:
A covenant of loyalty to each other and to God. Verses 43-55.
    11. As Jacob approached Canaan, who met him in Mahanaim? What
caused great fear to take possession of his heart? Gen. 32:1-8.
    12. To whom did he appeal? Of what promise did he remind the
Lord? Verses 9-12.
    13. After sending presents to his brother Esau, and arranging for
his company and his herds, how did Jacob spend the night? What defi-
nite spiritual victory did he gain? What change of character was indi-
cated by his change of name? Verses 24-32.
    NOTE.—"Jacob had received the blessing for which his soul had
longed. His sin as a supplanter and deceiver had been pardoned. The
crisis in his life was past. Doubt, perplexity, and remorse had em-
bittered his existence, but now all was changed; and sweet was the
peace of reconciliation with God. Jacob no longer feared to meet his
brother. God, who had forgiven his sin, could move the heart of Esau
also to accept his humiliation and repentance."—Id., p. 198.
    No longer was Jacob the "supplanter," selfish, grasping, but gen-
erous and humble, a "prince with God." He had suffered, and by his
suffering had been taught the lessons he needed in his life to make him
a true father of Israel.
                                 [13]
     "Jacob's experience during that night of wrestling and anguish
 represents the trial through which the people of God must pass just
 before Christ's second coming. The prophet Jeremiah, in holy vision
,looking down to this time, said: 'We have heard a voice of trembling,
 of fear, and not of peace. . . . All faces are turned into paleness. Alas!
 for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of
 Jacob's trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.' "—Id., p. 201.
    14. Under what circumstances did Jacob meet Esau? What was the
attitude of Esau? Gen. 33:1-4.
    NoTE.—"While Jacob was wrestling with the Angel, another heav-
enly messenger was sent to Esau. In a dream, Esau beheld his brother
for twenty years an exile from his father's house ; he witnessed his
grief at finding his mother dead; he saw him encompassed by the hosts
of God. This dream was related by Esau to his soldiers, with the charge
not to harm Jacob, for the God of his father was with him. . . . At
sight of that crippled sufferer, 'Esau ran to meet him, and embraced
him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him; and they wept.' As they
looked upon the scene, even the hearts of Esau's rude soldiers were
touched."—Id., p. 198.
   15. As he entered Canaan, what cleansing work was done in Jacob's
camp? What blessing did God pronounce? Gen. 35:1-5, 9-12.
  16. To what place did Jacob come at the end of his long journey?
Verse 27; 37:1.
   17. At the time of Jacob's death in Egypt, what arrangements did
be make for his burial? Gen. 49:29-32.
    NomE.—"The last blessings pionounced, Jacob repeated the charge
concerning his burial. . . . Thus the last act of his life was to manifest
his faith in God's promise. Jacob's last years brought an evening of
tranquillity and repose after a troubled and weary day."—Id., p. 237.
    18. How fully did Joseph carry out his father's wishes? Gen. 50:
7-13.
                       MEDITATION TOPICS
    Why are so many chapters in the Bible devoted to the history of
Jacob?
    What were some of the worst traits in Jacob's character I As these
were overcome, what became the strong, ruling elements in his life?
    How was the change in Jacob's character suggested by the change
of his name?

         JACOB AND HIS TWELVE SONS
MEMORY VERSE: 1 John 3:5.
LESSON HELP: "Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 208-214 (new ed., pp. 207-214).
MAP STUDY: Locate the places mentioned in the lesson.

                            INTRODUCTION
    "The sin of Jacob, and the train of events to which it led, had not
failed to exert an influence for evil,—an influence that revealed its
bitter fruit in the character and life of his sons."—"Patriarchs and
Prophets," p. 208.
                              THE LESSON
   1. How many sons had Jacob? Who was the first-born son of
Rachel? Gen. 49 : 28 ; 30 : 22-24.
    2. For what reason did Jacob set his affection especially upon Jo-
seph? By what gift did he single him out from his brothers? What was
the effect of this attitude of Jacob upon his other sons? Gen. 37:3, 4.
    NOTE.—"The rabbis describe him as a wise son, endowed with
knowledge beyond his years. It was this, combined with the sweetness
of his disposition, and the memory of his mother, that won for him his
father's peculiar love."—"Joseph," F. B. Meyer, p. 13.
    3. Where were Jacob and his sons dwelling? How old was Joseph?
As he was feeding the flocks, with whom was he placed? What report
did Joseph bring to Jacob? Verses 1, 2.
    NoTE.—"He 'brought unto his father their evil report.' At first
sight this does not seem a noble trait in his character. . . . At the same
time there may have been circumstances that justified, and even de-
manded, the exposure. It is sometimes the truest kindness, after due
and repeated warning, to expose the evil deeds of those with whom we
live and work."—Id., p. 14.
    4. What was revealed to Joseph in a dream? What was the effect
of this dream upon his brothers? Verses 5-8.
    5. In a second dream, what further revelation of the future was
given? What was the attitude of his father and his brethren concern-
ing this second dream? Verses 9-11.
    NoTE.—"Notwithstanding the apparent severity of his words, Jacob
believed that the Lord was revealing the future to Joseph. As the lad
stood before his brothers, his beautiful countenance lighted up with the
Spirit of inspiration, they could not withhold their admiration; but they
did not choose to renounce their evil ways, and they hated the purity
that reproved their sins. The same spirit that actuated Cain was kin-
dling in their hearts."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 210.
  6. To what place did Joseph's brethren go to feed the flocks? On
what errand did Jacob send Joseph? Verses 12-14.
                                   [15 1
     7. How was Joseph directed to the place where his brothers were
feeding their flocks? Verses 15-17.
     8. As they saw him in the distance, what evil plan did they form?
Verses 18-20.
     NOTE.—"His brothers saw him approaching; but no thought of the
long journey he had made to meet them, of his weariness and hunger,
of his claims upon their hospitality and brotherly love, softened the
bitterness of their hatred. The sight of the coat, the token of their
father's love, filled them with frenzy. 'Behold, this dreamer eometh,'
they cried in mockery. Envy and revenge, long secretly cherished, now
controlled them."—Id., pp. 210, 211.
    9. Hearing the plan of the brothers, what counsel did Reuben give?
What purpose had he in mind? Verses 21, 22.
     NOTE.—"They would have executed their purpose but for Reuben.
He shrunk from participating in the murder of his brother, and pro-
posed that Joseph be cast alive into a pit, and left there to perish;
secretly intending, however, to rescue him, and return him to his
father. Having persuaded all to consent to this plan, Reuben left the
company, fearing that he might fail to control his feelings, and that
his real intentions would be discovered."—Id., p. 211.
    10. Before casting Joseph into the pit, what did they take from
him? Verses 23, 24.
    11. As they sat eating, whom did they see passing? What change
of purpose now came into their minds? Why did this seem to them a
better plan? Verses 25-27.
    12. What was the price they received for Joseph? To what country
did the Midianitish caravan take Joseph? What place did he pass on
the journey? What resolves formed in his heart? Verse 28.
    NoTE.—"As the caravan journeyed southward toward the borders
of Canaan, the boy could discern in the distance the hills among which
lay his father's tents. Bitterly he wept at thought of that loving father
in his loneliness and affliction. . . . For a time, Joseph gave himself
up to uncontrolled grief and terror. .
    "Then his thoughts turned to his father's God. In his childhood he
had been taught to love and fear Him. . . Now all these precious les-
sons came vividly before him. Joseph believed that the God of his
fathers would be his God. He then and there gave himself fully to the
Lord, and he prayed that the Keeper of Israel would be with him in the
land of his exile.
    "His soul thrilled with the high resolve to prove himself true to
God,—under all circumstances to act as became a subject of the King
of heaven. He would serve the Lord with undivided heart; he would
meet the trials of his lot with fortitude, and perform every duty with
fidelity. One day's experience had been the turning point in Joseph's
life."—Id., pp. 213, 214.
   13. What was Reuben's attitude when he returned to the camp and
found that Joseph was not there? Verses 29, 30.
                                  161
     NOTE.—"Reuben returned to the pit, but Joseph was not there. In
alarm and self-reproach he rent his garments, and sought his brothers.
. . . Upon learning the fate of Joseph, and that it would now be im-
possible to recover him, Reuben was induced to unite with the rest in
the attempt to conceal their guilt."—Id., p. 212.
   14. 'What deceitful course did the brothers pursue to explain the
absence of Joseph to their father? Verses 31, 32.
    15. What was the effect upon Jacob? What did all seek to do for
Jacob? With what results? Verses 33-35.
    NOTE.—"Time seemed to bring no alleviation of his grief.         will
go down into the grave unto my son mourning,' was his despairing cry.
The young men, terrified at what they had done, yet dreading their
father's reproaches, still hid in their own hearts the knowledge of their
guilt, which even to themselves seemed very great."—Ibid.
    16. To whom did the Midianites sell Joseph in Egypt? Verse 36.
    NOTE.—"Arriving in Egypt, Joseph was sold to Potiphar, captain
of the king's guard, in whose service he remained for ten years. He was
here exposed to temptations of no ordinary character. He was in the
midst of idolatry. The worship of false gods was surrounded by all
the pomp of royalty, supported by the wealth and culture of the most
highly civilized nation then in existence. Yet Joseph preserved his sim-
plicity, and his fidelity to God."—Id., p. 214.
                         MEDITATION TOPICS
   To what is sin compared? Ps. 40:2.
   What was the relationship of the Ishmaelites and the Midianites?
Gen. 25:1, 2, 4, 12, 13.

   GOD'S CARE OVER JOSEPH IN EGYPT
MEMORY VERSE: Matt. 25:21.
LESSON HELP: "Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 214-223 (new ed., pp. 214-221).

                            INTRODUCTION
    "We can not hide our ways from the Most High. Human laws,
though sometimes severe, are often transgressed without detection, and
hence with impunity. But not so 'with the law of God. The deepest
midnight is no cover for the guilty one. He may think himself alone ;
but to every deed there is an unseen witness. The very motives of his
heart are open to divine inspection. Every act, every word, every
thought, is as distinctly marked as though there were only one person
in the whole world, and the attention of heaven were centered upon
him."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 217, 218.
                                  E 17 ]
                               THE LESSON
    1. What blessings attended Joseph as a slave in the house of Poti-
 phar, captain of the king's guard? Who was blessed also for Joseph's
sake? Gen. 39:1-6.
    2. Who sought to tempt Joseph while he was in the house of Poti-
 phar? Because he remained loyal to his master and to God, what pun-
ishment did he receive? Gen. 39:7-9, 20.
    NOTE.—"Joseph's gentleness and fidelity won the heart of the chief
 captain, who came to regard him as a son rather than a slave. . . . If
we were to cherish an habitual impression that God sees and hears all
that we do and say, and keeps a faithful record of our words and actions,
and that we must meet it all, we would fear to sin. Let the young ever
remember that wherever they are, and whatever they do, they are in the
presence of God. No part of our conduct escapes observation."—"Pa-
triarchs and Prophets," p. 217.
    3. Who was with Joseph in the prison? Because of this what favor
was shown him? Gen. 39:21-23.
    NoTE.—"God was preparing him [Joseph], in the school of afflic-
tion, for greater usefulness, and he did not refuse the needful discipline.
In the prison, witnessing the results of oppression and tyranny, and
the effects of crime, he learned lessons of justice, sympathy, and mercy,
that prepared him to exercise power with wisdom and compassion."—
Id., p. 218.
    4. During Joseph's imprisonment, what two servants of the king
were cast into prison? Into whose charge were they given? Gen. 40:1-4.
    5. What drew Joseph's special attention to them? What was the
cause of their sorrow? Who did Joseph say could interpret their
dreams? Verses 5-8.
    6. What was the dream of the butler? Of the baker? What inter-
pretation of their dreams did Joseph give? Verses 9-19.
    7. How completely were their dreams fulfilled? When the butler
was restored, what request did he forget? Verses 20-23.
    8. What recalled Joseph to the butler's memory? What double
dream came to Pharaoh? How did the butler describe Joseph? Gen.
41:1-13.
    NOTE.—"A divine hand was about to open the prison gates. . . .
The king's perplexity and distress increased, and terror spread through-
out his palace. The general agitation recalled to the chief butler's mind
the circumstances of his own dream ;, with it came the memory of Joseph,
and a pang of remorse for his forgetfulness and ingratitude. He at
once informed the king how his own dream and that of the chief baker
had been interpreted by a Hebrew captive, and how the predictions
had been fulfilled."—Id., p. 219.
    9. What did the interpretation of these dreams reveal to the king
of Egypt? How soon would the fulfillment take place? Verses 25-32.
                                   [ 18]
    10. What counsel did Joseph give Pharaoh concerning making pro-
vision for the years of famine? Verses 33-36.
    11. What decision did Pharaoh make? To what exalted position was
Joseph called? How complete was his authority in Egypt? Verses
37-44.
    NOTE.—"It was a wonderful ascent, sheer in a single bound from
the dungeon to the steps of the throne. His father had rebuked him;
now Pharaoh, the greatest monarch of his time, welcomes him. His
brethren despised him; now the proudest priesthood of the world opens
its ranks to receive him by marriage into their midst, considering it
wiser to conciliate a man who was from that moment to be the greatest
force in Egyptian politics and life. The hands that were hard with the
toils of a slave are adorned with a signet ring. The feet are no longer
tormented by fetters ; a chain of gold is linked around his neck. . . .
He was once trampled upon as the offscouring of all things; now all
Egypt is commanded to bow before him, as he rides forth in the second
chariot, prime minister of Egypt, and second only to the king."—
"Joseph," Meyer, pp. 73, 74.
  12. How did Joseph become even more closely connected with
Egyptian interests? How old was he at this time? Verses 45, 46.
  13. During the seven plenteous years, what provision did Joseph
make for the seven lean years to follow? Verses 47-49.
   14. What children were born to Joseph during this period? What
do their names indicate concerning Joseph's attitude toward his exile
and afflictions? Verses 50-52.
    15. How was Joseph enabled to make such a record for firmness of
character, uprightness, and wisdom? Answer: "In his early years he
had consulted duty rather than inclination."—"Patriarchs and Proph-
ets," p. 222.
    NoTE.—"Joseph's character bore the test alike of adversity and pros-
perity. The same fidelity to God was manifest when he stood in the
palace of the Pharaohs as when in a prisoner's cell. He was still a
stranger in a heathen land, separated from his kindred, the worshipers
of God; but he fully believed that the divine hand had directed his steps,
and in constant reliance upon God he faithfully discharged the duties
of his position. . . .
    "A pure and simple life had favored the vigorous development of
both physical and intellectual powers. Communion with God through
Hia works, and the contemplation of the grand truths intrusted to the
inheritors of faith, had elevated and ennobled his spiritual nature,
broadening and strengthening the mind as no other study could do.
Faithful attention to duty in every station, from the lowliest to the most
exalted, had been training every power for its highest service. He who
lives in accordance with the Creator's will is securing to himself the
truest and noblest development of character."—"Patriarchs and Proph-
ets," p. 222.

                         MEDITATION TOPICS
    What was the secret of Joseph's success?
    What is the cause of ingratitude?
    What is further revealed concerning the experiences of Joseph while
in prison?
    How did Joseph make the true God known to Pharaoh?

            Lesson 7—November 16, 1929
           JOSEPH AND HIS BRETHREN
MEMORY VERSE: Gen. 50:19, 20.
LESSON HELP: "Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 224-240 (new ed., pp. 223-239).
                            INTRODUCTION
    "It was envy that moved the brothers of Joseph to sell him as a
slave; they hoped to prevent him from becoming greater than them-
selves. And when he was carried to Egypt, they flattered themselves
that they were to be no more troubled with his dreams; that they had
removed all possibility of their fulfillment. But their own course was
overruled by God to bring about the very event that they designed to
hinder. . . . Joseph, through his bondage in Egypt, became a savior
to his father's family; yet this fact did not lessen the guilt of his
brothers. . . . Joseph's patience and meekness under injustice and op-
pression, his ready forgiveness and noble benevolence toward his un-
natural brothers, represent the Saviour's uncomplaining endurance of
the malice and abuse of wicked men, and His forgiveness, not only of
His murderers, but of all who have come to Him confessing their sins
and seeking pardon."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 239, 240.
                             THE LESSON
    1. With the coming of the seven years of dearth, what conditions
became general throughout the eastern countries? Where only was
there corn? Gen. 41:53-57.
    2. Knowing that there was corn in Egypt, what command did Jacob
give his sons? Who alone stayed with their father? Gen. 42:1-5.
    3. On arriving in Egypt, to whom did the brothers go? What did
they do that was a fulfillment of Joseph's dreams? Having recog-
nized them, of what did the ruler accuse them? How did he test them?
Verses 6-17.
    NoTE.--"He [Joseph] had grown from a lad of seventeen to a man
of forty. He was clothed in pure white linen, with ornaments of gold
to indicate his rank, a garb not altogether unlike that famous coat,
which had wrought such havoc. He was governor of the land, and if
they had thought of Joseph at all when entering that land (as no doubt
they did), they expected to see him in the gangs of slaves manacled at
work in the fields, or sweltering in the scorching brickyards, preparing'
                                  [20 1
material for the pyramids. So, in unconscious fulfillment of his own
boyish dream, they bowed down themselves before him with their faces
to the earth."—"Joseph," F. B. Meyer, p. 85.
    4. At the end of three days, what proposition did Joseph make to his
brothers? What thoughts were in their hearts as the result of his re-
quest? As Joseph heard their conversation, how was he affected? Who
was left bound in Egypt? Verses 18-24.
    NomE.—"The brethren . . . must have thought him rough and un-
kind. How they must have trembled in his presence! But they knew
not the heart of tender love that was beating beneath all this seeming
hardness. Nor could they guess that the retention of Simeon was in-
tended to act as a silken cord to bring the brothers back to him, and as
part of the process of awakening the memory of another brother, whom
they had lost years before."—Id., pp. 90, 91.
     5. What startling discovery did they make on the return journey?
What was the effect of their report upon their father? Verses 35-38.
     6. Driven by their need, to what did Jacob eventually consent?
What pledge did Judah make? In whom did Jacob place his hope?
Gen. 43:8-14.
     7. To whose house were they conducted on their arrival in Egypt?
Why did they feel afraid? Verses 16-18.
     8. When Joseph arrived, how again did they fulfill his early dreams?
Concerning whom did he ask? How did the sight of Benjamin affect
Joseph?. Verses 26-30.
     9. What knowledge did the seating of the eleven show? What test
of their unselfishness did he arrange? Verses 31-34.
     NoTE.—"When all were seated, the brothers were surprised to see
that they were arranged in exact order, according to their ages. Joseph
 `sent messes unto them from before him;' but Benjamin's was five times
as much as any of theirs. By this token of favor to Benjamin he hoped
to ascertain if the youngest brother was regarded with the envy and
 hatred that had been manifested toward himself. Still supposing that
 Joseph did not understand their language, the brothers freely conversed
 with one another; thus he had a good opportunity to learn their real
 feelings."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 228, 229.
     10. What further test of their lives did Joseph make? Instead of
 leaving Benjamin to his fate when he appeared guilty, what attitude
 did the brothers take? What plea did Judah make? To insure his
 father's happiness, what was Judah willing to do? Gen. 44:1-13, 18,
32, 33.
     11. After listening to Judah's unselfish plea and offer, what revela-
 tion did Joseph make? How did Joseph acknowledge God's leadings?
 Gen. 45:1-8.
     Nomx.—"Joseph was satisfied. He had seen in his brothers the fruits
 of true repentance. . . . His brothers stood motionless, dumb with fear
 and amazement. The ruler of Egypt their brother Joseph, whom they
 had envied and would have murdered, and finally sold as a slave! All
                                     211
their illtreatment of him passed before them. They remembered how
they had despised his dreams, and had labored to prevent their fulfill-
ment. Yet they had acted their part in fulfilling these dreams; and now
that they were completely in his power, he would, no doubt, avenge the
wrong that he had suffered. . . . Feeling that they had already suf-
fered enough for their cruelty toward him, he nobly sought to banish
their fears, and lessen the bitterness of their self-reproach."—Id., pp.
230, 231.
    12. What plan was at once formed for the family of Jacob? How
did Pharaoh show his interest? Verses 9-11, 17, 18.
    13. 'When this experience was related to Jacob, what effect did it
have upon him? Verses 25-28.
    14. While on the way to Egypt, what assurance did God give to
Jacob? At what place were father and son reunited? Gen. 46:1-4,
28-31.
    15. What section of Egypt was allotted to Jacob's family? What
unusual thing did Jacob do during his interview with Pharaoh? Gen.
47:1-10.
    NorrE.—"Not long after their arrival, Joseph brought his father
also to be presented to the king. The patriarch was a stranger in royal
courts; but amid the sublime scenes of nature he had communed with a
mightier Monarch; and now, in conscious superiority, he raised his
hands and blessed Pharaoh."—Id., p. 233.
    16. When Jacob was 147 years of age, what pledge did he take of
Joseph? Verses 28-31.
    17. By Pharaoh's permission, where did Joseph bury Jacob? Gen.
50:5-7.
    18. With what request did Joseph's brethren now come to him? In
his reply, what expression of living faith and confidence in God's lead-
ings did Joseph make? Verses 15-21, 24-26.
    NoTE.—Joseph had learned the lessons God had sought to teach him
by his life's experiences. There had been no rebellion against hardship,
rather a submission to God's providences with an intense loyalty and
devotion to righteousness. Zeal for his father's God fixed his eyes on
the people of the promise, and though exalted to the highest place in
the greatest kingdom of his time, he never lost sight of the ultimate
establishment of that people in Canaan. The fears of his brethren he
allayed by his kindness and his expressions of faith in God's leadings
in the past and for the future. Then from them he took an oath that
his own body should be carried by them to the Promised Land when God
should visit them. Thereby he expressed his active expectation of the
fulfillment of God's promises of the inheritance.

                             INTRODUCTION
     In allowing Israel to be enslaved of the Egyptian rulers, to endure
through years the rigors of an Eastern servitude that was bitter, con-
scienceless, merciless, God had the ultimate salvation of Israel in view.
His people were being strongly influenced by the idolatry about them.
Many were falling into the evil ways of their heathen neighbors. In the
hour of calamity, when the hand of the taskmasters was heavy upon
them, they were caused to remember the promises of their fathers' God.
Some had preserved through the years the memory of those promises
and looked forward to the return to Canaan. The bitterness of their
days of servitude brought with it a realization of their need and pre-
pared them for deliverance by the hand of one whom even then God was
fitting for the fulfillment of His plan.
    "The elders of Israel were taught by angels that the time for their
deliverance was near, and that Moses was the man whom God would
employ to accomplish this work. Angels instructed Moses also that
Jehovah had chosen him to break the bondage of his people. He, sup-
posing that they were to obtain their freedom by force of arms, ex-
pected to lead the Hebrew host against the armies of Egypt."—"Pa-
triarchs and Prophets," p. 245.
                             THE LESSON .
   1. After the death of Joseph and all his generation, what change in
the rulership of Egypt affected the relationship of the Israelites to the
royal household? Ex. 1: 6-8.
    2. What fear did the new king express concerning Israel's prosper-
ity? What plan was put into operation to oppress Israel? Verses 9-11.
    NOTE.—"A different dynasty had succeeded to that which welcomed
them [Israel], and one to whom the name of Joseph had no charm. At
the time of which we write a tiny cloud of impending war trembled on
the Eastern sky, and suggested to the reigning monarch the fear that
there might be a coalition between his enemies and the Hebrew race,
which had grown into such numbers and might as to be very formidable.
He resolved, therefore, to wear them out, and to reduce both their num-
bers and their spirit by the rigor of their lot.
    "Suddenly, the shepherds of Goshen found themselves drafted for
service in the brickfields, under the eye and whip of cruel taskmasters,
who exacted from them daily a certain tale of bricks; or they performed
service in the field, drawing water from the river for the irrigation of
the land, and toiling in the cultivation of the soil."—"Moses, the Serv-
ant of God," F. B. Meyer, p. 12.
                                   [ 233
    3. What results followed the rigorous treatment of them? How are
the feelings of Israel described as the Egyptians oppressed them?
Verses 12-14.
    4. To what extreme measure did Pharaoh resort to attain his pur-
pose? Verse 22.
    5. During this period of cruelty, when a son was born to Amram
and Jochebed, of the tribe of Levi, what efforts were made to preserve
his life? Ex. 2:2-4.
    6. By what strange series of circumstances did the babe become a
member of the royal family in Egypt? In the providence of God, how
was the child Moses instructed and trained in the worship of the true
God? Verses 5-10.
    NOTE.—"God had heard the mother's prayers; her faith had been
rewarded. It was with deep gratitude that she entered upon her now
safe and happy tastc. . . . She endeavored to imbue his mind with the
fear of God and the love of truth and justice, and earnestly prayed that
he might be preserved from every corrupting influence. She showed him
the folly and sin of idolatry, and early taught him to bow down and
pray to the living God, who alone could hear him and help him in every
emergency. She kept the boy as long as she could, but was obliged to
give him up when he was about twelve years old. From his humble cabin
home he was taken to the royal palace, to the daughter of Pharaoh, 'and
he became her son.' Yet even here he did not lose the impressions re-
ceived in childhood. The lessons learned at his mother's side could not
be forgotten. They were a shield from the pride, the infidelity, and
the vice that flourished amid the splendor of the court."—"Patriarchs
and Prophets," pp. 243, 244.
    7. When Moses grew to manhood, whom did he visit? What incident
occurred that aroused his sympathy for his own people? What drastic
action did he take? Verses 11, 12.
    8. About this time, to what decision did Moses come? Heb. 11:24-26.
    9. What conflict between two Hebrews enlisted his interference?
What caused Moses to fear? Ex. 2:13, 14.
    NOTE.—"The whole matter was quickly made known to the Egyp-
tians, and, greatly exaggerated, soon reached the ears of Pharaoh. It
was represented to the king that this act meant much; that Moses de-
signed to lead his people against the Egyptians, to overthrow the gov-
ernment, and to seat himself upon the throne; and that there could be
 no security for the kingdom while he lived. It was at once determined
 by the monarch that he should die; but becoming aware of his danger,
 he made his escape, and fled toward Arabia."—Id., p. 247.
    10. When Pharaoh sought to slay Moses because of his decision to
 cast in his lot with Israel, where did Moses flee? Verse 15.
    11. What apparently trivial incident led to the connection of Moses
with the family of the priest of Midian? Verses 16-21.
    NOTE.—Moses remained in Midian for forty years, keeping the
 flocks of Jethro. "It was not God's will to deliver His people by war-
                                    [24]
fare, as Moses thought, but, by His own mighty power, that the glory
might be ascribed to Him alone. Yet even this rash act was overruled
by God to accomplish His purposes. Moses was not prepared for his
great work. . . . In the school of self-denial and hardship he was to
learn patience, to temper his passions. Before he could govern wisely,
he must be trained to obey. His own heart must be fully in harmony
with God before he could teach the knowledge of His will to Israel. By
his own experience he must be prepared to exercise a fatherly care over
all who needed his help."---Ibid.
    12. During this time, what was God's attitude toward the enslaved
Israelites? What did He remember? Verses 23-25.

                PEOPLE
MEMORY VERSE: Ps. 91:10.
LESSON HELP: "Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 25,1-272 (new ed., pp. 250-271).
                           INTRODUCTION
    The chapters considered in this lesson carry us rapidly over an im-
portant but familiar part of the story of ancient Israel. Having fled
to Midian and having dwelt there as a shepherd for forty years, unlearn-
ing the wrong principles he had learned in the royal court, and learning
lessons needed for his future work as leader and shepherd of Israel,
Moses is now called from his lowly, quiet task to the eventful years of
the Exodus. God had fitted him for this work of leadership during his
exile. Distrusting himself, he could be used as a strong human instru-
ment of almighty power. The lessons of trust in God, his contacts with
the evidences of God's power and protection, made Moses a leader whom
God could trust and in whom the people could place confidence.
    The conflict in Egypt meant facing earth's most powerful king, de-
manding recognition of the God of heaven and His commands from king
and country. The most terrible afflictions with which any nation has
ever been punished were to be brought upon Egypt through God's chosen
instrument. This required manhood of the highest order, experience
such as God had brought to Moses, tenacity of purpose that knew noth-
ing but the complete fulfillment of God's commands. To this task God
called Moses, and nobly did the servant fulfill the will of his Lord.
                                 [ 251
                             THE LESSON
    1. What employment did Moses follow in Midian? Who appeared
to him in Horeb? What was the manner of appearance of the angel of
the Lord? Ex. 3:1- 2.
    2. As Moses saw the burning bush, what did he do? What instruc-
tion did God give him? How did this experience affect Moses? Verses
3-6.
    NoTE.—"Humility and reverence should. characterize the deport-
ment of all who come into the presence of God. In the name of Jesus
we may come before Him with confidence, but we must not approach
Him with the boldness of presumption, as though He were on a level
with ourselves. There are those who address the great and all-powerful
and holy God, who dwelleth in light unapproachable, as they would ad-
dress an equal, or even an inferior. There are those who conduct them-
selves in His house as they would not presume to do in the audience
chamber of an earthly ruler. These should remember that they are in
His sight whom seraphim adore, before whom angels veil their faces.
God is greatly to be reverenced; all who truly realize His presence will
bow in humility before Him."—Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 252.
    3. What had God seen and heard? For what had He come down?
To what task did He call Moses? Verses 7-10.
    4. What was Moses' first response? What did God say would be a
token of His call to Moses? Verses 11, 12.
    5. By whom was Moses to tell Israel he had been sent? Verses 13-15.
    6. To whom was Moses first to go? Before whom would he then ap-
pear? What did God say would be the response of Pharaoh? How would
the Egyptians finally show favor to the Israelites? Verses 16-22.
    NomE.—"The Egyptians had been enriched by the labor unjustly
exacted from the Israelites, and as the latter were to start on the jour-
ney to their new home, it was right for them to claim the reward of
their years of toil. They were to ask for articles of value, such as could
be easily transported, and God would give them favor in the sight of
the Egyptians. The mighty miracles wrought for their deliverance
would strike terror to the oppressors, so that the requests of the bond-
men would be granted."—Id., p. 253.
    7. By what three signs did God indicate to Moses His power to de-
liver? Ex. 4:1-9.
    8. When Moses complained of his own slowness of speech, what
provision did God make for a spokesman? What was to be the position
and work of Moses? Verses 10-17.
    9. Who was sent to meet Moses in Mt. Horeb? On their arrival in
Egypt, to whom did they first go? What was the response of the people
to what Moses and Aaron said and did? Verses 27-31.
    10. When Moses and Aaron approached Pharaoh for the release of
Israel, what response did the king make? What new burdens were laid
on Israel? Ex. 5:1-9.
                                    26
    NOTE.—"The point of the [Pharaoh's] reply lies in that word obey.
He saw that these men did not present him with a request, but with a
mandate from One of greater authority than himself. This stung him
to the quick. He also was a god. Who was this other God, stronger than
himself, who dared to issue such a summons! . . . The God of a parcel
of slaves! How dare they speak of their paltry Deity in his presence,
and in the midst of priests, courtiers, and high officers of state!"—
"Moses, the Servant of God," F. B. Meyer, p. 46.
   11. When the oppressions of Pharaoh became so great that Israel
could not endure them, what did they do? What course did Moses fol-
low? Verses 20-23.
   12. In older to bring Pharaoh to a realization of His power, and
make him willing to let Israel go, what did God promise to do? Ex.
6:6-8.
   NOTE.—The real question at issue may be briefly stated thus: The
Lord says: "Let My people go." Pharaoh replies: "Who is Jehovah,
that I should hearken unto His voice to let Israel go? I know not Jeho-
vah, and moreover I will not let Israel go." Ex. 5:2, A. R. V.
   We now enter upon some of the most dramatic scenes in the Bible,
and are privileged to watch a contest between two great opposing forces.
    13. What series of afflictions were brought upon Pharaoh and his
people before they were willing to let Israel depart from Egypt? An-
swer: Ten plagues. Exodus 7-11.
    NomE.—The plagues of Egypt were sent upon Pharaoh and his peo-
ple to bring to them opportunity for knowing the might and power of
the true God and of yielding obedience to Him. Had the Egyptian rulers
and people been willing to see God's revealed will, it would have meant
to them what it later meant to Nineveh when Jonah warned it of de-
struction. But Egypt chose its idols, and only a few of the mixed mul-
titude followed Israel in the Exodus. One by one the judgments of
God fell upon the hardened, idolatrous nation. A plague of frogs
quickly followed the turning of Egypt's watercourses to blood; lice
followed the frogs, and flies the lice; upon the beasts came murrain,
and upon both man and beast a plague of boils; these were followed by
thunder and hail from which only Israel and the land of Goshen were
saved. Locusts followed, and darkness impenetrable held the whole
land in thrall; only among God's people was there light. Yet Pharaoh's
heart was hardened, and the crowning punishment came in the death of
the first-born of man and beast. Unwilling as they had been to acknowl-
edge the sovereignty of the Creator or to yield their arrogant pride to
His call to obedience, they were at last compelled to urge Israel to leave
Egypt. Thus God did indeed bring Israel out of Egypt with a mighty
hand and a stretched-out arm, according to His promise.
   14. In the story of the plagues that were brought upon Egypt,
what is repeatedly said concerning Pharaoh's heart? Ex. 8:15, 19, 32.
   NOTE.—How was Pharaoh's heart hardened? God gave light to
Pharaoh, but when he turned from the light and refused to listen to His
entreaties and warnings, his heart became hard. Rejection of the light
                                 [ 271
that God gave him hardened his heart. This is the experience of all.
If the Lord shows us a duty, and we refuse to do it, we are beginning
a course that hardens our hearts, so that it will be more difficult to do
right the next time. Thus it may be said that the Lord hardens the
hearts of men who reject the light He sends. By earnest prayer and
faithful observance of every known duty, our hearts may be kept ten-
der and may be easily impressed by God's Spirit.
    15. For what purpose does God send His judgments into the world?
Of what were these plagues a type? Isa. 26:9, last part.
    NoTE.—The plagues of Egypt niay be regarded as a type of the
seven last plagues, which are to fall upon the unrepentant and the un-
godly in the end of the world. The plagues of Egypt fell upon a nation
that had gone far into sin, and were worshipers of false gods. The seven
last plagues will fall upon a world in rebellion against God. The great
multitude will harden their hearts in iniquity and suffer the outpouring
of God's wrath. The plagues of Egypt preceded the deliverance of
God's people. The seven last plagues precede the call of God's children
into their promised inheritance.
                      MEDITATION TOPICS
   What lesson was proud King Pharaoh to learn from the Lord's
dealings with him?
   What lessons should the Lord's people learn from such experiences/
   By what processes are hearts "hardened" spiritually?


             Lesson 10—December 7, 1929
                   THE PASSOVER
MEMORY VERSE: 1 Cor. 5:7.
LESSON HELP: "Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 273-280 (new ed., pp. 273-279).
                            INTRODUCTION
    "As Moses rehearsed to Israel the provisions of God for their de-
liverance, 'the people bowed the head and worshiped.' The glad hope
of freedom, the awful knowledge of the impending judgment upon their
oppressors, the cares and labors incident to their speedy departure,—
all were for the time swallowed up in gratitude to their gracious De-
liverer. Many of the Egyptians had been led to acknowledge the God
of the Hebrews as the only true God, and these now begged to be per-
mitted to find shelter in the homes of Israel when the destroying angel
should pass through the land. They were gladly welcomed, and they
pledged themselves henceforth to serve the God of Jacob, and to go forth
from Egypt with His people."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 279.
                          THE LESSON
   1. Before the tenth and last great plague was brought upon the
Egyptians, what did the Lord say with reference to that month and
year? Ex. 12:1, 2.
                               [ 28 ]
     NOTE.-A new era began with the Israelites when they were de-
livered from Egyptian bondage. The new year was begun by the cele-
bration of the Passover feast which was to be a continual reminder to
Israel of their great deliverance.
     2. What preparations on the part of Israel were now to be made?
How was the number of persons in a family taken into account? Verses
3, 4.
     3. What instruction was given concerning the lamb? Verses 5, 6.
     4. What was to be done with the blood of the lamb? With the flesh?
Verses 7-10.
     5. How were the people to be dressed as they ate the Passover?
Verse 11.
     6. What should that day be to the people? Verses 14, 17.
     7: After receiving this instruction from the Lord, what did Moses
do? Verses 21, 22.
     NorrE.—"Draw out" a lamb, that is, out of the sheepfolds. Probably
this refers to the custom of a shepherd or a shearer who uses his crook
to catch the leg of the sheep and draw it from the flock.
     Jewish tradition fixes the number of persons at ten for which one
lamb was apportioned.
     Hyssop was a bushy herb.
     "The hyssop used in sprinkling the blood was the symbol of purifica-
tion, being thus employed in the cleansing of the leper and of those
defiled by contact with the dead. In the psalmist's prayer also its sig-
nificance is seen: 'Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash
me, and I shall be whiter than snow.' "—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p.
277.
     8. What protection was promised to those whose houses bore the
mark of the sprinkled blood? Verse 23.
     9. What was this feast called? Of whom was the Passover lamb a
type? Verses 11, 27; John 1:29; 1 Cor. 5:7.
     NoTE.—"The Passover was to be both commemorative and typical,
not only pointing back to the deliverance from Egypt, but forward to
the greater deliverance which Christ was to accomplish in freeing His
people from the bondage of sin. . . . It was not enough that the paschal
lamb be slain; its blood must be sprinkled upon the doorposts; so the
merits of Christ's blood must be applied to the soul. We must believe,
not only that He died for the world, but that He died for us individually.
We must appropriate to ourselves the virtue of the atoning sacrifice."
—Ibid.
     10. How long were the Israelites to observe the Passover? Why
were they to observe it? Ex. 12:24-27.
     NoTE.—"In commemoration of this great deliverance, a feast was to
be observed yearly by the people of Israel in all future generations.
. . . As they should keep the feast in future years, they were to repeat
to their children the story of this great deliverance, as Moses bade
them."—Id., p. 274.
                                     29
     11. What shows that the Jews were still observing the Passover
when Jesus was on earth? Luke 22:1; John 12:1.
     NomE.—Jesus was crucified at the time of the Passover, and was the
real Passover Lamb. As the Israelites were required to put the blood
of the lamb on their doors that the destroying angel might pass over
them, so we must have the blood of Christ applied to our hearts if we
are to be saved in the kingdom of God.
     Note the perfectness of the fulfillment of the type:
     (1) The Lamb of God, Jesus Christ, "was perfect, without spot or
blemish, or fault of any kind.
    "(2) He was innocent. His death was from no fault of His.
    "(3) He died in the prime of His life.
    "(4) He was slain, a sacrifice for others.
    "(5) He was offered at the season and the hour of the- paschal sac-
rifice.
    "(6) Not a bone was broken. This was true of His body. We are
saved by 'the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world'
 (John 1:29) ; 'who knew no sin,' yet 'He hath made Him to be sin for
us' (2 Cor. 5:21; 1 Peter 1 :19)."—Peloubet.
     The Passover pointed forward to the sacrificial death of the Lamb of
God; the Lord's Supper is a memorial of His death till He returns.
     12. How did the children of Israel show that they believed the Lord?
Ex. 12:28.
     13. What came to pass at midnight? Who were stricken in this
plague? What was heard throughout Egypt? Verses 29, 30.
     14. What did Pharaoh hasten to do? What permission did he give?
What did the Egyptians urge? Verses 31-33.
     15. What did the Israelites carry with them as they left? What did
the Egyptians give them? Verses 34-36.
     Novx.—"In preparation for their going and in order to have the
necessary support during their long journey in the wilderness, the
Israelites were advised to ask (not 'borrow' as in the common version)
of the Egyptians, jewels of silver and gold, and raiment, in part pay-
ment of their long services. And the Egyptians gave (not 'lent' as in
the common version) these in abundance. The whole circumstances of
that awful night made them very liberal."—Peloubet.
     16. How many were called out of Egypt in the deliverance of Israel?
Verses 37-39.
     NomE.—For an explanation of Exodus 12:40, 41; Genesis 15:13,
and Galatians 3:15-17, see "Patriarchs and Prophets," Appendix,
note 6.

      DELIVERANCE AT THE RED SEA;
          MANNA FROM HEAVEN
MEMORY VERSE: Ex. 15:2.
LESSON HELPS: "Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 281-302, 377-386 (new ed.,

                           INTRODUCTION
    "God in His providence brought the Hebrews into the mountain fast-
nesses before the sea, that He might manifest His power in their de-
liverance, and signally humble the pride of their oppressors. He might
have saved them in any other way, but He chose this method in order
to test their faith and strengthen their trust in Him. The people were
weary and terrified, yet if they had held back when Moses bade them
advance, God would never have opened the path for them. It was 'by
faith' that 'they passed through the Red Sea as by dry land.' In march-
ing down to the very water, they showed that they believed the word of
God as spoken by Moses. They did all that was in their power to do,
and then the Mighty One of Israel divided the sea to make a path for
their feet. The great lesson here taught is for all time."—"Patriarchs
and Prophets," p. 290.
                             THE LESSON
    1. From what place did the Israelites start when they left Egypt?
About how large was the company? How were they guided on the way?
Ex. 12:37, 38; 13:20-22.
    2. When Israel had started on their journey, what change of mind
came to Pharaoh? What course did he follow? Ex. 14:5-9.
    3. What instruction did Moses give to Israel? How were they en-
abled to cross the Red Sea? How were they protected from their ene-
mies? Verses 13-22.
    4. As the Egyptians attempted to use the path God had made
through the Sea, what disaster overtook them? Verses 23-31.
    NOTE.—That portion of the Red Sea which the Israelites crossed is
supposed to be the arm of the sea now called the Gulf of Suez. Authori-
ties estimate that the sea at that point must have been twelve miles
wide.
    5. How did Israel celebrate their deliverance? Answer: By sing-
ing a song of victory. Ex. 15:1-21.
    Nom.—"This song and the great deliverance which it commemo-
rates, made an impression never to be effaced from the memory of the
Hebrew people. From age to age it was echoed by the prophets and
singers of Israel, testifying that Jehovah is the strength and deliver-
ance of those who trust in Him. That song does not belong to the Jew-
ish people alone. It points forward to the destruction of all the foes of
                                  [31 ]
 righteousness, and the final victory of the Israel of God. The prophet
of Patmos beholds the white-robed multitude that 'have gotten the vic-
tory,' standing on the 'sea of glass mingled with fire,' having 'the harps
of God. And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the
song of the Lamb.' "—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 289.
      6. What was the occasion of Israel's first murmuring against the
Lord? Ex. 15:22-26.
      NOTE.—"In their horror and despair they reproached Moses for
having led them in such a way, not remembering that the divine pres-
ence in that mysterious cloud had been leading him as well as them-
selves. In his grief at their distress, Moses did what they had forgotten
to do; he cried earnestly to God for help."—Id., p. 291.
      7. What was the second occasion for complaint? What response
did the Lord make? Ex. 16:2-6.
      8. In what manner did God's provision for their needs come to them?
What instruction was given Israel concerning gathering the manna?
How was the Sabbath day recognized? Verses 14-26.
      9. What question was asked of some who sought for manna on the
Sabbath? What further instruction was given? Verses 28-32.
      NOTE.—"God requires that His holy day be as sacredly observed now
as in the time of Israel. The command given to the Hebrews should be
regarded by all Christians as an injunction from Jehovah to them. The
day before the Sabbath should be made a day of preparation, that
everything may be in readiness for its sacred hours. . . . Many care-
lessly put off till the beginning of the Sabbath little things that might
have been done on the day of preparation. This should not be. Work
that is neglected until the beginning of the Sabbath should remain un-
done until it is past. This course might help the memory of these
thoughtless ones, and make them careful to do their own work on the
six working days."—Id., p. 296.
     10. Where and for what reason did Israel again murmur? How was
their need supplied? Because of Israel's attitude, what was the place
named? Ex. 17:1-7.
     11. What instruction is given concerning murmuring and complain-
ing? What effect does constant indulgence of this spirit have upon the
life? Phil. 2:14, 15; 1 Cor. 10:10, 11.
      NOTE.—"Jesus is our friend; all heaven is interested in our welfare;
and our anxiety and fear grieve the Holy Spirit of God. We should not
indulge in a solicitude that only frets and wears us, but does not help
us to bear trials. No place should be given to that distrust of God which
leads us to make a preparation against future want the chief pursuit of
life, as though our happiness consisted in these earthly things. It is
not the will of God that His people should be weighed down with care.
. . . Instead of murmuring and complaining, the language of our hearts
should be, 'Bless the Lord, 0 my soul; and all that is within me, bless
His holy name. Bless the Lord, 0 my soul, and forget not all His bene-
fits.' "—Id., p. 294.
                                    [ 32 ]
   12. What were the results to Israel of this evil course in the wilder-
ness? Ps. 106:24-27.
   13. With whom was Israel forced to battle in Rephidim? By what
means was victory assured? Ex. 17:8-13.
   14. What caused Miriam and Aaron to murmur against the leader-
ship of Moses? What did the Lord say to the three of them? Num.
12:1-8.
   15. What swift punishment did God send? How did God honor
Moses in answering his prayer? Verses 9-15.
   16. To what mountain did Israel come? Ex. 19:1, 2.

             Lesson 12—December 21, 1929
              THE GIVING OF THE LAW
MEMORY VERSE: Deut. 5:29.
LESSON HELP: "Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 303-314 (new ed., pp. 305-317).
                             INTRODUCTION
    In the restoration of the law to ancient Israel, lost to the knowledge
of many of them during their servitude and constant contact with
heathenism, God used agencies never before manifested to men. In
mighty demonstration of power He came down upon Sinai. Not by hu-
man instrumentality, but by His own finger He wrote His holy law
upon tables of stone. The sight of His glory, reflected on Moses' coun-
tenance, was too much for Israel, and they feared greatly. It was in-
tended that they should never forget the lessons of that hour. But all
too soon their own physical desires caused them to lose sight of the
experience at Sinai, and they broke the law so lately and so vividly im-
pressed upon them.
    The lessons of that time are for to-day. God's remnant people have
been called out of Egypt (sin) to obey His law. We are nearing the
Promised Land. Around us are temptations more distracting, perplexi-
ties more overwhelming, hardships fully as difficult, as Israel faced in
the wilderness. Only trust in God, patience, unquestioned faithfulness,
will give us victory.
                               THE LESSON
    1. While in Egyptian slavery, into what spiritual condition had
many in Israel fallen? Ex. 5:21; 6:9.
    NOTE.—"During all the years of servitude in Egypt, there had been
among the Israelites some who adhered to the worship of Jehovah.
                                   [33 1
These were sorely troubled as they saw their children daily witnessing
the abominations of the heathen, and even bowing down to their false
gods. In their distress they cried unto the Lord for deliverance from
the Egyptian yoke, that they might be freed from the corrupting in-
fluence of idolatry."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 259.
    "During the bondage in Egypt, many of the Israelites had, to a
great extent, lost the knowledge of God's law, and had mingled its pre-
cepts with heathen customs and traditions. God brought them to Sinai,
and there with His own voice declared His law."—Id., p. 334.
    2. For what reason did God call Israel out of Egypt? Ex. 8:1.
    NOTE.—"By His mighty power, notwithstanding the opposition of
Pharaoh, God delivered His people from Egypt, that they might keep
the law which had been given in Eden. He brought them to Sinai to
hear the proclamation of this law. By proclaiming the Ten Command-
ments to the children of Israel with His own voice, God demonstrated
their importance. In awful grandeur He made known His majesty and
authority as Ruler of the world. This He did to impress the people
with the sacredness of His law and the importance of obeying it"—
Testimonies, vol. 8, pp. 197, 198.
    3. How long had God's law been known to man? Answer: From
creation.
    To Abraham—Gen. 26:5.
    To Lot-2 Peter 2:7, 8.
    To Noah-2 Peter 2:5.
    To Cain and Abel—Gen. 4:7.
    To Adam—Rom. 5:12, 13.
    NOTE.—The law was known to Adam and to all his successors in the
patriarchal line, for "by the law is the knowledge of sin," and sin came
by one man, Adam. Of Abraham it is said that he kept God's laws.
Noah was "upright" in his generation. Lot was vexed by the ways of
the wicked. They recognized sin as the transgression of God's law.
    4. How else is it shown that the law was known to the patriarchs?
Rom. 4:15; 5:13.
    NOTE.—Where there is no law "there is no transgression." If God's
law did not exist before it was written upon the tables at Sinai, there
could be no transgression of that law. But Cain was a murderer and
was punished for it; of the antediluvian world it is written: "God saw
that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imag-
ination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil every day." Gen. 6:5.
margin. Jacob stole his brother's birthright and was banished for
many years. Sin there was, and it was punished. In the presence of
sin a law is evident, for without it there can be no sin.
    5. While Israel was encamped before Mt. Sinai, where did Moses
go to commune with God? What did the Lord say He would do? What
preparations were to be made for this event? Ex. 19:1-3, 9-13.
    6. Under what circumstances did God speak His law? Verses 16-20.
    7. Where is the law recorded in the Bible? Exodus 20.
                                 [ 34
   8. After speaking the law in an audible voice, what did God give
to Moses? What wish did God express concerning Israel's relationship
to His law? Deut. 5:22, 28, 29.
   NoTE.—"Never since man was created had there been witnessed such
a manifestation of divine power as when the law was proclaimed from
Sinai. . . . When Moses came from the divine presence in the mount,
where he had received the tables of the testimony, guilty Israel could
not endure the light that glorified his countenance. How much less can
transgressors look upon the Son of God when He shall appear in the
glory of His Father, surrounded by all the heavenly host, to execute
judgment upon the transgressors of His law and the rejecters of His
atonement."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 340.
   9. 'What did God definitely set before them? Deut. 11:26-28.
   NOTE.—The Lord left the choice and its consequences to each in-
dividual and to the nation.
    10. On what condition alone does Christ say men may enter into
eternal life? Matt. 19:17.
    11. How does the Saviour sum up the law of Ten Commandments?
Matt. 22:37-40.
    12. Which of the commandments deal directly with our relation to
God? Ex. 20:3-11.
    13. Which deal with our association with our fellow men? Verses
12-17.
    NOTE.—"The first four of the Ten Commandments are summed up
in the one great precept, 'Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
heart.' The last six are included in the other, 'Thou shalt love thy
neighbor as thyself.' Both these commandments are an expression of
the principle of love. The first can not be kept and the second broken,
nor can the second be kept while the first is broken. When God has His
rightful place on the throne of the heart, the right place will be given
to our neighbor. We shall love him as ourselves. And only as we love
God supremely is it possible to love our neighbor impartially.
    "And since all the commandments are summed up in love to God
and man, it follows that not one precept can be broken without violat-
ing this principle. Thus Christ taught His hearers that the law of God
is not so many separate precepts, some of which are of great import-
ance, while others are of small importance, and may with impunity be
ignored. Our Lord presents the first four and the last six command-
ments as a divine whole, and teaches that love to God will be shown by
obedience to all His commandments."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 607.
    14. What prevented all but two of those who left Egypt from en-
tering the Promised Land? Answer: Murmuring and unbelief. Num.
14:1-5, 26-39.
    NOTE.—"Notwithstanding all that God had wrought for them, not-
withstanding his [Moses'] own prayers and labors, only two of all the
adults in the vast army that left Egypt, had been found so faithful that
they could enter the Promised Land."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," pp.
471, 472.
                                 [ 35 ]
    15. What danger is faced by the remnant people in these last days?
Heb. 10:35-37.
    NOTE.—"That this admonition is addressed to the church in the last
days is evident from the words pointing to the nearness of the Lord's
coming: 'For yet a little while, and He that shall come will come, and
will not tarry.' And it is plainly implied that there would be a seeniii
delay, and that the Lord would appear to tarry. The instruction here
given is especially adapted to the experience of Adventists zit this time.
The people here addressed were in danger of making shipwreck of
faith. . . . Their only safe course was to cherish the light which they
had already received of God, hold fast to His promises, and continue to
search the Scriptures, and patiently wait and watch to receive further
light."—"The Great Controversy," pp. 407, 408.
    16. What will be said of those who triumph with the remnant?
Rev. 14:12.
    17. Whet, then, should se       seek to do? Heb. 10:38, 39.
                        MEDITATION TOPICS
   Have I thi,..:7ht enough of the law of God to memorize it accurately?
   How may I         r into the experience of having the law of God writ-
ten in my heart/ Jc-r. 31:33.
   What was the attitude of Christ toward that law? Ps. 40:8.


            Lesson 13 —December 2 8, 1929
             GOD'S DWELLING PLACE
MEMORY VERSE: Ex. 25:8.
LESSON HELPS: "Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 343-358 (new ed., pp. 345-
   359) ; Testimonies, vol. 5, pp. 491-500.
                            INTRODUCTION
    God had led Israel out of Egypt that they might be free to worship
Him. The experiences of the wilderness wandering were to develop
character lost during their long years of enslavement. At Sinai they
had God's holy law renewed to them. On the mountain God had per-
sonally revealed Himself to Moses, and had made known the attributes
of His divine character. (See Ex. 34:6, 7.)
    That Israel might have His presence ever among them during their
journeyings, and later in their national life; that the Lamb "slain from
the foundation of the world" might become the center of their worship,
and their star of hope, He called Moses into the mount and showed him
"the patterns of things in the heavens." From these patterns Moses was
to build an earthly sanctuary in which were offered sacrifices typical
of Christ, and in which God's presence, the holy Shekinah, was to dwell
within the most holy place. Thus in addition to His promise to dwell
by His Spirit in human hearts, His visible presence was constantly
manifest in the sanctuary above the mercy seat.
    In the fullness of time Christ came, fulfilling the sacrificial system
which pointed to Him. No longer was the elaborate ritual of the tem-
                                    361
ple necessary. With the establishment of the church of Christ with its
humble body of believers, a new era began. Meeting ofttimes in secret;
without the outward marks of an organized religious body, they found
God in the upper room, on the mountain side, in the grove, or in the
vast silences of the desert, and He graced their assemblies by the gift
of His Holy Spirit.
                              THE LESSON
     1. What instruction did Moses receive from God concerning a place
of worship in Israel? Ex. 25:8.
     2. After what was this sanctuary to be patterned? Heb. 8:5; 9:23.
     NOTE.—"God Himself gave to Moses the plan of that structure, with
particular directions as to its size and form, the materials to be em-
ployed, and every article of furniture which it was to contain. The holy
places made with hands were to be 'figures of the true,' patterns of
things in the heavens' [Heb. 9:24, 23],—a miniature representation of
the heavenly temple where Christ, our great High Priest, after offer-
ing His life as a sacrifice, was to minister in the sinner's behalf. God
presented before Moses in the mount a view of the heavenly sanctuary,
and commanded him to make all things according to the pattern shown
him."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 343.
     3. Where in this earthly sanctuary did God promise to commune
with Israel? Ex. 25:22.
     NOTE.—"Beyond the inner veil was the holy of holies, where cen-
 tered the symbolic service of atonement and intercession, and which
 formed the connecting link between heaven and earth. . . . Above the
 mercy seat was the Shekinah, the manifestation of the divine presence;
 and from between the cherubim, God made known His will. . . . Beyond
 the second veil the sacred ark, with its mystic cherubim, and above it
 the holy Shekinah, the visible manifestation of Jehovah's presence; all
 but a dim reflection of the glories of the temple of God in heaven, the
 great center of the work for man's redemption."—Id., pp. 348, 349.
      4. How many apartments were there in the sanctuary? What fur-
 nishings were placed in each apartment? Ex. 26:33-35.
      5. Who were called to the priest's office to minister in the sanctu-
 ary? Ex. 28:1.
      6. Who only was allowed to come into the most holy place? When
  was he to enter it? Lev. 16:1-3.
      NoTE.—"No mortal eye but that of the high priest was to look upon
  the inner apartment of the sanctuary. Only once a year could the priest
  enter there, and that after the most careful and solemn preparation.
  With trembling he went in before God, and the people in reverent
  silence awaited his return, their hearts uplifted in earnest prayer for
  the divine blessing. Before the mercy seat the high priest made the
  atonement for Israel; and in the cloud of glory, God met with him.
  His stay here beyond the accustomed time filled them with fear, lest
  because of their sins or his own he had been slain by the glory of the
  Lord."—Id., p. 352.
                                   [ 37 ]
    7. What was to be the attitude of the people toward the sanctuary
and its services? Lev. 26:2; Ps. 89:7.
    NOTE.—"As the priests morning and evening entered the holy place
at the time of incense, the daily sacrifice was ready to be offered upon
the altar in the court without. This was a time of intense interest to
the worshipers who assembled at the tabernacle. Before entering into
the presence of God through the ministration of the priest, they were
to engage in earnest searching of heart and confession of sin. They
united in silent prayer, with their faces toward the holy place. Thus
their petitions ascended with the cloud of incense, while faith laid hold
upon the merits of the promised Saviour prefigured by the atoning sacri-
fice. The hours appointed for the morning and the evening sacrifice
were regarded as sacred, and they came to be observed as the set time
for worship throughout the Jewish nation. . . . In this custom, Chris-
tians have an example for morning and evening prayer. While God
condemns a mere round of ceremonies, without the spirit of worship, He
looks with great pleasure upon those who love Him, bowing morning
and evening to seek pardon for sins committed, and to present their
requests for needed blessings."—Id., pp. 353, 354.
    8. In the earthly sanctuary, who was the central figure of Israel's
worship? Rev. 13:8.
    NOTE.—"In the ministration of the tabernacle, and of the temple
that afterwards took its place, the people were taught each day the great
truths relative to Christ's death and ministration, and once each year
their minds were carried forward to the closing events of the great con-
troversy between Christ and Satan, and final purification of the uni-
verse from sin and sinners."—Id., p. 358.
    9. At the death of Christ on the cross of Calvary, what met its ful-
fillment? To what place was the sanctuary service transferred? Who
was its high priest and the central figure of its service? Heb. 9:6-12.
    NomE.—"When the loud cry, 'It is finished,' came from the lips of
Christ, the priests were officiating in the temple. It was the -hour of the
evening sacrifice. . . . With intense interest the people were looking
on. But the earth trembles and quakes,; for the Lord Himself draws
near. With a rending noise the inner veil of the temple is torn from
top to bottom by an unseen hand, throwing open to the gaze of the
multitude a place once filled with the presence of God. . . .
    "All is terror• and confusion. The priest is about to slay the victim;
but the knife drops from his nerveless hand, and the lamb escapes. Type
has met antitype in the death of God's Son. The great sacrifice has been
made. The way into the holiest is laid open. A new and living way is
prepared for all. No longer need sinful, sorrowing humanity await the
coming of the high priest. Henceforth the Saviour was to officiate as
priest and advocate in the heaven of heavens. It was as if a living
voice had spoken to the worshipers: There is now an end to all sacri-
fices and offerings for sin."—"The Desire of Ages," pp. 756, 757.
    10. Although the sanctuary and its service is centered in the heav-
ens, what has Christ promised to those who worship in His name?
Matt. 18:20.
                                     38
     11. To the humble, believing soul, what does the house of God on
earth become?
     NOTE.—"To the humble, believing soul, the house of God on earth
is the gate of heaven. The song of praise, the prayer, the words spoken
by Christ's representatives, are God's appointed agencies to prepare a
people for the church above. . . . From the sacredness which was at-
tached to the earthly sanctuary, Christians may learn how they should
regard the place where the Lord meets with His people. . . Happy
are those who have a sanctuary, be it high or low, in the city or among
the rugged mountain caves, in the lowly cabin or in the wilderness. If
it is the best they can secure for the Master, He will hallow the place
with His presence, and it will be holy unto the Lord of hosts."—Testi-
monies, vol. 5, pp. 491, 492.
     12. What constitutes true worship? James 1:27;- Isa. 58:6, 7; Heb.
13:5.
     13. How fully must the heart and life be consecrated to God's serv-
 ice for our worship to be acceptable? Luke 10:27.          •
     14. What are we admonished to do as the day of God approaches?
 Heb. 10:25.
     15. In the assemblies of God's people, what kind of worship should
 be offered? John 4:24.
      NOTE.—"Not by seeking a holy mountain or a sacred temple are men
 brought into communion with Heaven. *Religion is not to be confined to
 external forms and ceremonies. The religion that comes from God is
 the only religion that will lead to God. In order to serve Him aright, we
 must be born of the divine Spirit. This will purify the heart and renew
 the mind, giving us a new capacity for knowing and loving God. It
 will give us a willing obedience to all His requirements. This is true
 worship. It is the fruit of the working of the Holy Spirit. By the Spirit
 every sincere prayer is indited, and such prayer is acceptable to God.
  Wherever a soul reaches out after God, there the Spirit's working is
 manifest, and God will reveal Himself to that soul. For such worship-
  ers He is seeking. He waits to receive them, and to make them His sons
  and daughters."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 189.
      16. Who will be the center of all true worship in the church of God
  to-day? 1 Cor. 2:2.
      NomE.—"Christ is the center of all true doctrine. . . . He is the
  one in whom our hopes of eternal life are centered."—"Counsels to
  Teachers," p. 453.
      "Uplift Jesus as the center of all .11ope, 'the Root and the Offspring
  of David, and the bright and morning Star.' Rev. 22:16."—Testimonies,
  vol. 6, p. 62.

      Might the presence of the Lord be in a meeting and a careless per-
  son not discern it'?
      What are outward evidences of an irreverent spirit?
      In what part of the service should every one engage heartily'?
