                                  THE LESSON
     1. By what names are the sacred writings of the Bible commonly
 known? Matt. 21:42; Luke 8:21.
     NOTE.—"The Bible is God's voice speaking to us, just as surely as
 though we could hear it with our ears. If we realized this, with what
 awe would we open God's word, and with what earnestness would we
 search its precepts? The reading and contemplation of the Scriptures
 would be regarded as an audience with the Infinite One."--"Testi-
 monies," Vol. 6, p. 393.
     2. How were the Scriptures given? 2 Tim. 3:16.
     3. By whom were the men directed who thus spoke for God?
2 Peter 1:21; Zech. 7:12.
     4. What should the Scriptures then be to us? Deut. 32:46, 47;
 John 6:63, last part; Heb. 4:12.
                                         E3 ]
     NOTE.—"The life of God, which gives life to the world, is in His
 word."—"Gospel. Workers," p. 250.

     6. For what purpose were the Scriptures written? Rom. 15:4.
     7. For what are the Scriptures profitable? 2 Tim. 3:16, 17.
     NOTE.—"The whole Bible is a revelation of the glory of God in
 Christ. Received, believed, obeyed, it is the great instrumentality in
 the transformation of character. And it is the only sure means of
intellectual culture."—"Testimonies," Vol. 8, p. 319.
     8. What are we exhorted to do? John 5:39.
     NOTE.—"Let the truth of God be the subject for contemplation and
 meditation. Read the Bible, and regard it as the voice of God speaking
 directly to you. Then will you find inspiration and that wisdom which
is divine."—Id., Vol. 7, p. 205.
     9. How earnestly should we search the Scriptures? Prov. 2:3-5.
     NoTE."There is but little benefit derived from a hasty reading
of the Scriptures. One may read the whole Bible through, and yet fail
to see its beauty or comprehend its deep and hidden meaning. One
Fassage studied until its significance is clear to the mind, and its
relation to the plan of salvation is evident, is of more value than the
perusal of many chapters with no definite purpose in view and no
positive instruction gained. Keep your Bible with you. As you have
opportunity, read it; fix the texts in your memory. Even while you
are walking the streets, you may read a passage, and meditate upon
it, thus fixing it in the mind."—"Steps to Christ," p. 95.
     10. How are we guided in our study of the word of God? John
16:13; 1 Cor. 2:11-13.
     NoTE.—"Never should the Bible be studied without prayer. Before
opening its pages we should ask for the enlightenment of the Holy
Spirit, and it will be given."—Id., p. 96.
     "We should carefully study the Bible, asking God for the aid of
the Holy Spirit, that we may understand His word. We should take
one verse, and concentrate the mind on the task of ascertaining the
thought which God has put in that verse for us."—"The Desire of
Ages," p. 390.
     11. What does God design that His word shall be to us in this
world clouded by the darkness of sin? Ps. 119:105.
     12. How are we to receive and treat the Scriptures? 1 Thess. 2:13;
Isa. 66:2, last part.
     NOTE.—"We should come with reverence to the study of the Bible,
feeling that we are in the presence of God. All lightness and trifling
should be laid aside. While some portions of the Word are easily
understood, the true meaning of other parts is not so readily discerned.
There must be patient study and meditation, and earnest prayer.
Every student, as he opens the Scriptures, should ask for the enlight-
enment of the Holy Spirit; and the promise is sure, that it will be
given."—"Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel Workers," pp. 107, 108.
                                  14]

    15. How was the power of the Word to keep one from sinning illus-
trated in the life of Christ? Matt. 4:3-11.
    16. How highly did Job esteem the words of God2 What is the
testimony of Jeremiah concerning them? Job 23:12; Jer. 15:16.
  17. What danger faces those who do not know the Scriptures?
Matt. 22:29; Amos 8:11, 12.
   18. What is the word of God able to do for us? 1 Peter 1:23;
Acts 20:32.
    NOTE.—"The Bible and the Bible alone, can produce this good re-
sult. It is the wisdom of God and the power of God, and it works with
all power in the receptive heart. 0 what heights we might reach if we
would conform our wills to the will of God!"—"Testimonies," Vol. 8,
p. 194.

                           That trembles in the breast."

                            THE LESSON
    1. How does the psalmist address the Creator? Ps. 65:2.
    2. What is prayer? Ps. 142:1.
    NOTE.—"Prayer is the opening of the heart to God as to a friend."
'Prayer is the key in the hand of faith to unlock heaven's storehouse.V
    3. Where do the children of God gain the greitest victories? Gen.
32:28; Hosea 12:4.
     NOTE.—"The greatest victories gained for the cause of God are not
 the result of labored argument, ample facilitie, wide influence, or
 abundance of means; they are gained in the audience chamber with
 God, when with earnest, agonizing faith men lay hold upon the mighty
 arm of power.
    "True faith and true prayer—how strong they are! They are as
 two arms by which the human suppliant lays hold upon the power of
 Infinite Love."—"Gospel Workers," p. 259.
     4. What instruction regarding prayer is given to God's people?
  Luke 21:36; 1 Thess. 5:17; Col. 4:2.
     NOTE.—"Perseverance in prayer has been made a condition of re-
  ceiving. We must pray always, if we would grow in faith and experi-
  ence. We are to be 'instant in prayer,' to 'continue in prayer, and
  watch in the same with thanksgiving.' . . . Unceasing prayer is the
• unbroken union of the soul with God, so that life from God flows into
  our life; and from our life, purity and holiness flow back to God."—
  "Steps to Christ," pp. 101, 102.
     5. Why should we be diligent in prayer? 1 Peter 5:8.
    NOTE.—"The darkness of the evil one incloses those who negleerto
 pray. The whispered temptations of the enemy entice them to sin;
 and it is all because they do not make use of the privileges that God
 has given them in the divine appointment of p.raSrer. Why should the
 sons and daughters of God be reluctant to pray, when prayer is the
 key in the hand of faith to unlock heaven's storehouse, where are
 treasured the boundless resources of Omnipotence? Without unceas-
 ing prayer and diligent watching, we are in danger of growing careless
 and of deviating from the right path. The adversary seeks continually
 to obstruct the way to the mercy seat, that we may not by earnest
 supplication and faith obtain grace and power to resist temptation."
 —"Steps to Christ," pp. 98, 99.
     6. What is the example of Jesus concerning prayer? Mark-1:35;
 Luke 22:44; Heb. 5:7.
     NOTE.—"He [Christ] found comfort and joy in communion with
 His Father. And if the Saviour of men, the Son of God, felt the need
 of prayer, how much more should feeble, sinful mortals feel the neces-
 sity of fervent, constant prayer."—Id., p. 98.
     •                                          •
     7. Was Jesus sure that God always heard His prayers? John
11:41, 42.
                                    [7 1
   8. Should we have the same assurance? Matt. 7:7, 8, 11; James
5:17, 18.
      9. Does the Lord always immediately answer the prayer of His
  children? Acts 4:31; Luke 1:13.
      NOTE.—Sometimes the Lord answers the prayer, of His children
'immediately, as in the instance recorded in Acts 4:31. Sometimes He
  does not answer until later, as in the experience of Zachaiias. Luke
1:13. The words of Gabriel, "For thy prayer is heard," show that
  Zacharias and Elizabeth had prayed (and we have every reason to
 believe thdt they had prayed earnestly for a long time) for a son; but
  the words of Zacharias in the eighteenth verse, "For I am an old man,
  and my wife well stricken in years," show that they long ago had
  ceased praying for an, heir. Zacharias did not believe the words of
  the angel. Verse 20. A living faith in God and in His promises leaves
 it to God to answer the prayers' as He in His wisdom and love thinks
 best. Faith never forgets to say, "Nevertheless not as I will, but as
  Thou wilt." Matt. 26:39.

   10. Upon what condition has the Lord promised to hear and grant
our petitions? 1 John 3:22; 5:14, 15.
   11. What hinders the Lord's hearing some prayers? Prov. 28:9;
James 1:6, 7; 4:3; Ps. 66:18.

   12. What encouragement is given to those who pray when in
trouble? Ps. 46:1, 2; 107:6.
    NOTE.—"Keep your wants, your joys, your sorrows, your cares,
and your fears, before God. You can not burden Him; you can not
weary Him. He who numbers the hairs of your head is not indifferent
to the wants of His children. 'The Lord is ;very pitiful, and of tender
mercy.' His heart of love is touched by our sorrows, and even by our
utterance of them. Take to Him everything that perplexes the mind.
Nothing is too great for Him to bear, for He holds up worlds, He
rules over all the affairs of the universe.' Nothing that in any way
concerns our peace is too small for Him to notice. There is 110 chapter
in our experience too dark for Him to read; there is no perplexity too
difficult for Him to unravel.' No calamity can befall the least of His
children, no anxiety harass the soul, no joy cheer, no sincere prayer
escape the lips, of which our heavenly Father is unobservant, or in
which He takes no immediate interest. 'He healeth the broken in heart,
and bindeth up their wounds.' The relations between God and each
soul are as distinct and full as though there were not another soul
for whom He gave His beloved Son."—"Steps to Christ," pp. 104, 105.

   13. Do our prayers really ascend to God? Rev. 8:3; 5:8.
    NOTE.—Radio makes it possible for persons in New York to listen
to a lecture given in London. The words of the speaker reach them as
quickly as if they were sitting in the hall in London. The Lord,
through much more perfect means, has- made it possible for our
prayers to be heard before His throne in heaven.
                                18 ]
    14. What prayer did Jesus teach His disciples? Matt. 6:9-13.
What does this prayer teach- concerning the following points:
        a. The propef way to address God in prayer.
         b. The proper petition concerning His kingdom and
         c. How to express our dependence upon God.
         d. The measure of forgiveness Nye may properly ask.
         e. What help we may ask in overcoming.      •
         f. How to ascribe honor and praise.
    NOTE.—Jesus does not say that we are to learn that prayer by
heart and say it at all times and everywhere. Such an apprehension is
contrary to instruction given in Romans 8:26 and Philippians 4:6.
    15. Whose example should we avoid in praying? Matt. 6:5-7.
    NOTE.—"The prayers offered in public should be short and to the
point. God does not require us to make the season of worship tedious
by lengthy petitions. Christ did not enforce upon His disciples weari-
some ceremonies and long prayers."—"Gospel Workers," p. 175.
    "When you,pray, be brief, come right to the point. Do not preach
the Lord a sermon in your long prayers. Ask for the bread of life as
a hungry child asks bread of his earthly father. God will bestow upon
us every needed blessing, if we ask Him in simplicity and faith."—
"Testimonies," Vol. 5, p. 201.
    16. What instruction is given concerning the proper place for
prayer? Matt. 6:6; 18:19, 20.                                •
    NOTE.—"Seek every opportunity to go where prayer is wont to be
made. Those who are really seeking for communion with God, will be
seen in the prayer meeting. . . . We should pray in the family circle;
and above all we must not,neglect secret prayer; for this is the life
of the soul. It is impossible for the soul to-flourish while prayer is
neglected. Family or public prayer alone is not sufficient. . . . Pray.
in your closet; and as you go about your daily labor, let your heart
be often uplifted to God. It was thus that Enoch walked with God.
These silent prayers rise like precious incense before the throne of
grace. Satan can not overcome him whose heart is thus stayed upon
God. There is no time or place in which it is inappropriate to offer
up a petition to God. There is nothing that can prevent us from lift-
ing up our hearts in the spirit of earnest prayer. In the crowds of the
street, in the midst of a business engagement, we may send up 'a peti-
tion to God, and plead for divine guidance."—"Steps to Christ," pp.
102, 103.
    17. What instruction is given to the remnant church? What result
will follow if this admonition is heeded? Phil. 4:5-7.
    NOTE.—"We need to praise God more 'for His goodness, and for
His wonderful works to the children of men.' [Ps. 107:8.] Our devo-
tional exercises should not consist wholly in asking and receiving. Let
us not be always thinking of our wants, and never of the benefits we
receive. We do not pray any too much, but we are too sparing of
giving thanks. We are the constant recipients of God's mercies, and
yet how little gratitude we express, how little we praise Him for what
He has done for us."—Id., pp. 107, 108.

                                THE LESSON
    1.. What does the Bible state concerning faith? Heb. 11:1.
    NOTE.—The Revised Version reads: "Now faith is the assurance of
things h,oped for, the proving of things not seen." Faith is composed
of two elements, believing and doing. Belief alone is not faith; 'there
must be also accepta1/n 4 ce,—that is, taking 'upon God's terms. When
Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness
(Gen. 15:6), he surrendered his will to God's will.
    "Faith is trusting in God,—believing that He loves us, and knows
what is for our best good. Thus, instead of our own way, it leads us to
choose His way. In place of our ignorance, it accepts His wisdom; in
place of our weakness, His strength; in place of our sinfulness, His
righteousness. Our lives, ourselves, are already His; faith acknowl-
edges His ownership, and accepts its blessing."—"Gospel Workers,"
p. 259.
   2. On what foundation does true faith rest? Rom. 10:17.      ,
   NOTE.—Any     belief which has not the word of God for its founda-
tion is not faith. Faith believes the word, and acts according to its
teaching. "Through faith we understand" things that otherwise our
human minds could not grasp. Heb. 11:3.
   3. How does Christ dwell in our hearts? Eph. 3:17.
   4. Against whom must God's children wrestle? What part of the
Christian's armor is faith? What will it enable us to do? Eph. 6:12, 16.
                                 [ 10 ]
    5. How impossible is it to attain righteousness through our own
efforts? Jer: 13:23; Isa. 64:6.
    NOTE.—"It is impossible for us, of ourselves, to escape from the
pit of sin in which we are sunken. Our hearts are evil, and we can not
change them. 'Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean1—Not
one.' The carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to
the law of God, neither indeed can be.' Education, culture, the exercise
of the will, human effort, all have their proper Sphere, but here they
are powerless. They may produce an outward correctness of behavior,
but they can not change the heart; they can not purify the springs of
life."—"Steps to-Christ," p. 20.
   6. Who only can save and cleanse from sin? Acts 4:12; John 1:7.
   NoTE.—"There must be a power working from within, a new life
from above, before men can be changed from sin to holiness. That
power is Christ. His grace alone can quicken the lifeless faculties of
the soul, and attract it to God, to holiness."—Ibid.
   "It is the will of God to cleanse us from sin, to make us His chil-
dren, and to enable us to live a holy life. So we may ask for these
blessings, and believe that we receive them, and thank God that we
have received them."—Id., pp. 55, 56.
   7. What assurance is given us of victory through faith? 1 Cor.
15:57; 2 Cor. 2:14.                                 •
  8. What must we do that we may be cleansed from sin? What
must we believe? 1 John 1:9; Isa. 55:6, 7.
    NOTE.—"It is the privilege of all who comply with the conditions
to know for themselves that pardon is freely extended for every sin.
Put away the suspicion that God's promises are not meant for you.
They are for every repentant transgressor. Strength and grace have
been provided through Christ to be brought by ministering angels to
every believing soul. None are so sinful that they can not find
strength, purity, and righteousness in Jesus, who died for them."—
Id., p. 57.
   9. What enables us to gain the victory over the world? Who only
can achieve this victory? 1 John, 5:4, 5.
                                                    •
   10. What explanation is given of what is to be overcome in the
world? 1 John 2:16.
    11. How was Abraham made righteous? Gen.15:6; James 2:22, 23_
    NOTE.—Like Abraham, we must believe the promises of God and
not stagger. We must not look to ourselves "but strong in faith" give
"glory to God," having the assurance that what He has promised He
is also able to ,perform. Rom. 4:21.
   12. How are we made righteous? Rom. 5:1; iph. 2:8, 9.
   13. Where did the psalmist find power to overcome sin? Ps. 119:11.
   14. What testimony did he give concerning the power of the word
of God? Ps. 17:4.
                                11
   15. What shows that our personal blessings depend upon the meas-
ure of our faith? Matt. 9:27-29.
   16. For whom has God reserved an incorruptible inheritance?
1 Peter 1:3-5.
   17. What is promised to the overcomer? Rev. 3:5, 12, 21.
    18. What will be the song of those who gain the victory? Rev.
15:2, 3.

                               THE LESSON
    1. What precious promise did Jesus make to His disciples shortly
before His crucifixion? John 14:16.
    NOTE.—"The Holy Spirit was the highest of all gifts that He
[Christ] could solicit from His Father •for the exaltation of His
people. The Spirit was to be given as a regenerating agent, and with-
out this the sacrifice of Christ- would have been of no avail."—"The
Desire of Ages," p. 671.
    2. What other name did Jesus give the Comforter? In whose name
is He sent? What does the Holy Spirit do for the believer? Verse 26.
    NOTE.—"The Holy Spirit is Christ's representative, but divested of
the personality of humanity, and independent thereof."—Id., p. 669.
   3. Although.sent in the name of Jesus, from whom does the Holy .
Spirit proceed? John 15:26.
   4. What did Jess say was better than for Him to remain with
His disciples? John 16:7.       ,•
   NOTE.—"Cumbered with humanity, Christ could not be in every
place personally. Therefore it .was for their interest that He should
                                 [12 ]
  go to the Father, and send the Spirit.to be. His successor on earth.
. No one could then have any advantage because of his location or his
  personal contact with Christ. By the Spirit the Saviour would be
  accessible to all."—Ibid.
   5. How is the mission of the Holy Spirit described? Verses 8711.
   NOTE.—The marginal reading of verse 8 is, "He will convince the
 world of sin."
    6. What did Jesus say of the Spirit of truth? Verse 13.
    7. HoW may the work of the Spirit be briefly outlined?
  _ A nswer.—a. The Spirit speaks. 1 Tim. 4:1.

    9. On what condition do we receive the Holy Spirit? Acts 5:32;
 Gal. 3:14.
    NOTE.—"Christ has promised the gift of the Holy Spirit to His .
 church, and the promise belongs to us as much as to the first disciples.
 But like every other promise, it is given on conditions. There are many
 who believe and profess to claim the Lord's promise; they talk about
 Christ and about the Holy Spirit, yet receive no benefit. They do not
 surrender the soul to be guided and controlled by the divine agencies.
 We can not use the Holy Spirit. The Spirit is to use us. Through the
 Spirit God works in His people 'to will and to do of His good pleas-
 ure.' But many will not submit to this. They. want to manage them-
 selves. This is why they do not receive the heavenly gift. Only to
 those who wait humbly upon God, who watch for His guidance and
 grace, is the Spirit given. The power of God awaits their demand and
 reception. This promised blessing, claimed by faith, brings all other
 blessings in its train. It. is given according to the ri9hes of the grace
 of Christ, and He is ready to supply every soul according to the ca-
 pacity to receive."—Id., p. 672.
    10. Why did Christ have more 'of the Holy Spirit than His "fel-
 lows"? Heb. 1:9; Acts 10:38.
     NOTE.—"It is by the Spirit that the heart is made pure. Through
 the Spirit the believer becomes a partaker of the divine nature. Christ
 has given His Spirit as a divine power to overcome all hereditary and
 cultivated tendencies to evil, and to impress His own character upon
 His church."—Id., p. 671.
    11. What part does the Holy Spirit have in the new birth? John
3:5, 8; Titus 3:5.
    NOTE.—"Not by eloquence or logic are men's hearts reached, but
 by the sweet influences of the Holy Spirit, which operate quietly yet
 surely in transforming and developing character. It is the still small
                                  13
voice of the Spirit of God that has power to change the heart"—
"Prophets and Kings," p. 169.
   12. What are we admonished not to do? Eph. 4:30; Acts 7:51.
    13. What proves that there is a limit to the strivings of God's
Spirit? Gen. 6:3.
    NOTE.—The limit is determined by the creature rather than by the
Creator. 'When one utterly abandons himself to evil, further strivings
of the Spirit would be without avail. The Holy Spirit never ceases to
strive with man as long as there is any hope of his salvation.
   14. What was the result of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on
the day of Pentecost? Acts 2:37-41.
   NoTE.—" 'The multitude of them that believed were of one heart
and of one soul.' Acts 4:32. The Spirit of Him who died that sinners
might live animated the entire congregation of believers."—"Testi-
monies," Vol. 8, pp. 20, 21.
    15. What prophecy has been given of the experiences of the last
days? Acts 2:16-21; Joel 2:28, 29.
    NOTE. "To us to-day, as verily as to the first disciples, the promise
of the Spirit belongs. God will to-day endow men and women with
power from above, as He endowed those who on the day of Pentecost
heard the word of salvation. At this very hour His Spirit and His
grace are for all who need them and will take.Him at His word. . . .
    "Let Christians put away all dissension, and give theinselves to
God for the saving of the lost. Let them ask in faith for the promised
blessing, and it will come. The outpouring of the Spirit in the days
of the apostles was the 'former rain,' and glorips was the result. But
the latter rain will be more abundant."—Ibid.
   16. Before receiving the Spirit in its fullness, what must be the
experience of the people of God? Joel 2:15-17.
   NOTE.—"Before the final visitation of God's judgments upon the
earth, there will be, among the p6ople of the Lord, such a revival of
primitive godliness as has not been witnessed since the apostolic
times."—"The Great Controversy," p. 464.
   17. For what did David pray? Ps. 51:11.
   18. For what should we earnestly pray at this time? 'Zech. 10:1.
    NOTE.—"Near the close of earth's harvest, a special bestowal of
spiritual grace is promised to prepare the church for the coming of
the Son of man. This outpouring of the Spirit is likened to the falling
of the latter rain; and it is for this added power that Christians are
to send their petitions to the Lord of the harvest 'in the time of the
latter rain.' "—"The Acts of the Apostles," p.
    "For the baptism of the Spirit every worker should be pleading
with God. Companies should be gathered together to ask for special
help, for heavenly wisdom, that they may know how to plan and exe-
cute wisely. Especially should men pray that God will baptize His
missionaries with the Holy Spirit."—"Testimonies," Vol. 8, p. 22.

What comfort does Jesus offer in times of trial? John 16:33.
    2. How many of God's children will-be tried? 2 Tim. 3:12.
    NOTE.—"Trial is part of the education given in the school of
Christ, to purify God's children from the dross of earthliness. It is
because God is leading His children,'that trying experienced come to
them. Trials and obstacles are His chosen methods of discipline, and
His appointed conditiSns of success. . . . Often He permits the fires
of affliction to burn, that they may be purified."-"Acts of the Apos-
tles," p. 524.
   3. How important is the trial of our faith? 1 Peter 1:6, 7; James
1:2-4.
   NOTE.—"The fact that we are callhd upon to endure trial, proves
that the Lord Jesus sees in us something very precious, which He
desires to develop. If He saw in us nothing whereby He might glorify
His name, He would not spend time in refining us. We do not take
special pains in pruning brambles. Christ does not cast worthless
stones into His furnace. It is valuable ore that He tests."—"Testi-
monies," Vol. 7, p. 214.
   4. Whom does the Lord chasten? Heb. 12':6.
    5. What does God never willingly do? Lam. 3:31-33.                    •
    NOTE.—"Our sorrows do not spring out of the ground. God 'cloth
not afflict willingly fior grieve the children of men.' When He permits.
trials and a4fflictions, it is 'for our profit, that We might be partakers
of His holiness.' If received in faith, the trial that seems so bitter
and hard to bear will prove a blessing. The cruel blow that blights
the joys of earth will be the means of turning our eyes to heaven.
How many there are who would never have known Jesus had not sor- •
row ldd them to seek comfort in Him!
    "The trials of life are God's workmen, to remove the impurities and
roughness from our chaiacter. Their hewing, squaring, and chiseling,
their burnishing and polishing, is a painful process, it is•hard to be
pressed down to the grinding wheel. But the stone is brought forth
prepared to fill its place in the heavenly temple.7—"Thoughts from
the Mount of Blessing," pp. 23, 24.
  6. If we love and trust the Lord, of what may we be sure? Rom. 8:28.

Heb. 12:11.
                                     [ 17 ]
    NoTE.—"Not in freedom from trial, but in the midst of it, is Chris-
tian character developed. Exposure to rebuffs and opposition leads the
follower of Christ to greater watchfulness, and more earnest prayer-
to the nighty Helper. Severe trial endured by. the grace of God de-
velops patience, vigilance, fortitude, and a deep and abiding trust in
God. It is the triumph of the Christian faith that it enables its fol-
lower to suffer and be strong; to submit, and thus to conquer."—
"Acts of the Apostles," pp. 467, 468.
     8. How should we regard even the severe trials of life? 1 Peter
4 : 12, 13.
     NOTE.—"Through conflict the spiritual life is strengthened. Trials
well borne will develop steadfastness of character, and precious
spiritual graces. The perfect fruit of faith, meekness, and love often
matures best amid storm clouds and darkness."—"Christ's Object
Lessons," p. 61.
   9. What will God not permit? What will He always provide?
1'Cor. 10 : 13.
 - 10. What do afflictions, or trials, work out for\us? What will make
them seem light or small? At what should we look if our trials work
out for us a "weight of glory"? 2 Cor. 4:17, 18.
    11. In what spirit should we meet all our trials? Rom. 12:12.
    NOTE.—"In the full light of day, and in hearing of the music of
other voices, the caged bird will not sing the song that his master
seeks to teach him. He learns a snatch of this, a trill of that, but never
a separate and entire melody. But the master covers the cage, and •
places it where the bird will ,listen to the one song he is to sing. In
the dark, he tries and tries again to sing that song until it is learned,
and he breaks forth in perfect melody. Then the bird is brought forth,
and ever after he can sing that song in the light. Thus God' deals with
His children. He has a song to teach us, and when we have learned it
amid the shadows of affliction, we can sing it ever afterward."—
"Ministry of Healing," p. 472.

                               THE LESSON
   1. What is one of the attributes of the God of heaven? Rom. 15:5.
   2. How is this attribute revealed in His dealings with mankind?
Ps. 86:15; 2 Peter 3:9.
   NOTE.—"No human being possesses sensibilities so acute or a na-
ture so refined as does our Saviour. And what patience He manifests
toward us! Year after year He bears with our weakness and igno-
rance, with our ingratitude and waywardness. Notwithstanding all
our wanderings, our hardness of heart, our neglect of His holy words,
His hand ins stretched out still."—"Gospel Workers," p. 496.
  3. What unparalleled example of patience did our Saviour set in
His life? 1 Peter 2:23; Isa. 53:7.
    4. What comparison is made in the Bible between patience and
pride? Eccl. 7:8.
    5. What contrast is drawn between the patient and the hasty in
spirit? Prov. 14:29.
    6. How generally should patience be exercised? 1 Thess. 5:14,1
last clause; Eph. 4:2,13.
    NOTE.—"Christ will be revealed in us if we are indeed branches of
the Living Vine. We shall be patient, kind, and forbearing, cheerful
amid frets and irritations. Day by day and year by year we shall con-
quer self and grow into a noble heroism. This is our allotted task;
but it can not be accomplished without continual help from Jesus,
resolute decision, unwavering purpose, continual watchfulness, and un-
ceasing prayer."—"Testimonies," Vol. 5, p. 345.
    7. What experiences in life should develop patience? James 1:3;
Rom. 5:3.
                                      19
   NoTE.—"If injuries and insults are meekly borne, if insulting
words are responded to by gentle answers, and oppressive acts by
kindness, this is evidence that the Spirit of Christ dwells in the heart,
that sap from the Living Vine is flowing' to the branches. We are in
the school of Chiist in this life, where we are to learn to be meek and
lowly of heart."—"Testimonies," Vol. 5, p. 344.
     8. What did Moses do in an unguarded moment? What were the
.consequences to him and to Aaron? Ps. 106:32, 33; Num. 20:10-12.
     NOTE.—"Moses was not guilty of a great crime, as men would view
 the matter his sin was one of common occurrence. The psalmist says
 that 'he spake unadvisedly with his lips.' To huthan judgment this
 may seem a light thing; but if God dealt so severely with this sin in
 His most faithful and honored servant, He will not excuse it in others.
 The spirit of self-exaltation, the disposition to censure our brethren,
 is displeasing to God. Those who indulge in these evils cast doubt
 upon the work of God, and give the skeptical an excuse for their un-
 belief. The more important one's position, and the greater his influ-
 ence, the greater is the necessity that he should cultivate patience and
 humility."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 420.
   9. What example of patience is given us in the experience of Job?
In what spirit did he meet trouble? Job 1:1-3, 13-20, 22. •
    10. How is a lack of patience often revealed?—Answer.By our
words.
    11. What illustrations show by contrast the power of the tongue?
James 3:3-5.
    12. What evil is in the power of an unruly tongue? Verses 6-8.
    NOTE.—"The tongue that delights in Mischief, the babbling tongue
that says, Report, and I will report it, is declared by the apostle James
to be set on fire of hell. It scatters firebrands on every side. What
cares the vender of gossip that he defames the innocent? He will not
stay his evil work, though he destroy hope and courage in those who
are already sinking under their burdens. He cares only to indulge his
scandal-loving propensity. Even professed Christians close their eyes
to all that is pure, honest, noble, and lovely, and treasure up whatever
is objectionable and disagreeable,. and publish it to the world."—
"Testimonies," Vol. 5, p. 57.
    13. What is said of the man who does not offend in word? James 3:2.
    14. How' are we exhorted to run the Christian race? To whom
should we look for help? Heb. 12:1, 2.
    NOTE.—Patience means more than merely accepting without com-
plaint whatever comes to us. Patience is a positive virtue, not a nega-
tive one. Its real meaning is to endure, to continue to the end, to keep
on. Many give up before the race is finished. It is "he that endureth
to the end" who "shall be saved." Matt. 10:22.
    This meaning of endurance does not exclude the other meaning,—
of keeping sweet under provocation, of not losing the temp& under
                                  [20 1
insult. Christians should'always be able to control both their tongue
and their spirit under the gieatest trials. Christ supplies the strength
needed for all emergencies.          .-
   15. What power is promised to keep us patient in time of tempta-
tion? Col. 1:9, 11.
   16. What caused the apostle Paul to glory in the church at Thes-'
salonica? 2 Thess. 1:4.
   17. What is a prominent characteristic of the remnant church?
Rev. 14:12.
     18. What solemn admonitions seem to be meant especially for
those living in the last days? James 5:7-9.
  ' NOTE.—James 5:11 gives a good example of the meaning of the
word "patience." It means more than merely being sweet under provo-
cation. It means to endure. Job was not always sweet. He was sorely
tried, and sometimes gave vent to his feeling in rather sharp words.
In the narrow meaning of the word, Job may ,perhaps have failed;
but in the larger meaning,—that of enduring, of steadfastness, of
courage,—he was eminently successful. In the darkest hour, he could
say, "I know that my Redeemer liveth." Job 19:2:5.

                              THE LESSON I'
    1. Why did the Lord desire the children of Israel to build Him a
sanctuary? Ex. 25:8.
    NOTE.—"To the humble, believing soul, the house of God on earth '
is the gate of heaven. The song of praise, the prayer, the words spoken
by Christ's representatives, are God's appointed agencies to prepare a
people for the church above, for that loftier worship into which there
can enter nothing that defileth."—"Testimonies," Vol. 5, p. 491.
    2. How were the people taught to regard the sanctuary built in the
wildernesi? Lev. 19:30.
    NomE.—"The church is the sanctuary for the congregation. There
should be rules in regard to the time, the place, and the manner of
worshiping. Nothing that is sacred, nothing that pertains to the wor-
ship of God, should be treated with carelessness or indifference."—
Id., p. 491.
     3. What does the presence of God do for any place? Ex. 3:2-5;
Joshua 5:15.
     NomE.—"Happy are those who have a sanctuary, be it high or low,
in the city or among the rugged mountain caves, in the lowly cabin or
in the wilderness. If it is the best they can secure for the Master, He
will hallow the place with His presence, and it will be holy unto the
Lord of hosts."—Id., pp. 491, 492.
     4. How was the presence of God manifested in the sanctuary in the
wilderness and in Solomon's temple? Ex. 40:33-35; 2 Chron. 5:13, 14.
    5. According to whose command' were the work and the services
arranged? Ex. 40:16, 19, 21, etc.
    NOTE.—"From the sacredness which was attached to the earthly
sanctuary; Christians may learn how they should regard the place
where the Lord meets with His people. There has been a great change,
not for the better, but for the worse, in the habits and customs of the
people in reference to religious worship. The precious, the sacred
things which connect us with God, are fast losing their hold upon our
minds and hearts, and are being brought down to the level of common
things. The reverence which the people -had anciently for the "sanctu-
ary where they met with Goein sacred service, has largely passed
away. Nevertheless, God Himself gave the order of His service, exalt-
ing it high above everything of a temporal nature."—Ibid.
    6. When are we to feel special awe in the presence of God? Ps.
89:7; Hab. 2:20; Ps. 95:1, 6.                                  -
  • NOTE.—"True reverence for God is inspired by a sense of His infi-
nite greatness and a realization of His presence. With this sense of
the Unseen, every heart should be deeply- impressed. The hour and
place of prayer are sacred, because God is there. And as reverence is
manifested in attitude and demeanor, the feeling that inspires it will
be deepened. 'Holy and reverend is His name,' the psalmist declares.
Angels, when they speak that Name, veil their faces. With what rever-
ence, then, should we, who are fallen and sinful, take it upon our
lips!"—"Prophets and Kings," pp. 48, 49.
                                [ 22
    7. When God's people meet to worship Him, who is in their midst?
Matt. 18:20
    8. How is this unseen One to be regarded? Rev. 4:11.
    NOTE.—"When the worshipers enter the place of meeting, they
should do so with decorum, passing quietly to their seats.. . . COMmon
talking, whispering, and laughing should not be permitted in the house
of worship, either before or after the service. Ardent, active piety
should characterize the worshipers.
    "If some have to wait a few minutes before the meeting begins, let
them maintain a true spirit of devotion by silent meditation, keeping
the heart uplifted to God in prayer that the service may be of special
benefit to their own hearts, and lead to the conviction and conversion
of other souls. They should remember that heavenly messengers are
in the house."—"Testimonies," Vol. 5, p. 492.
  9. What is said of the name of the Lord? Ps. 111:9, last part;
Luke 1:49, last part.
   10. What did Jacob say when he awoke, from a dream which the
Lord gave him? How did he show honor to the place where the LOrd
had met him? Gen. 28:16-18, 22, first part.
    11. What experience in temple service is recorded as a warning to
all? Lev. 10:1-3.
    NOTE.—"God designed to teach the people that they must approach
Him with reverence and awe, and in His own appointed manner. He
can
  , not accept partial obedience. It was not enough that in this sol-
emn season of worship nearly everything was done as He had directed.
God has pronounced a curse upon those who depart from His com-
mandments, and put no difference between common and holy things."
—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 360.
    12. Upon what two occasions did Jesus show His regard for the
sanctity of His Father's house? John 2:13-16; Mark 11:15-17.
    NoTE.—The first cleansing of the temple occurred at the beginning
of -Christ's ministry. There was• a similar cleansing at the close of
His ministry.
    13. What invitation is extended to each one to join in the services
of the Lord's house? Ps. 95:1, 2, 6.
    NOTE.—"When the meeting is opened by prayer, every knee should
bow in the presence of the Holy One, and every heart should ascend to
God in silent devotion. The prayers of faithful worshipers will be
heard, and the ministry of the Word will prove effectual. The lifeless
attitude of the worshipers in the house of God is one great reason why
the ministry is not more productive of good. The melody of song,
poured forth froni many hearts in clear, distinct utterance, is one of
God's instrumentalities in the work of saving souls. All the service
should be conducted with solemnity and awe, as if in the visible pres-
ence of the Master of assemblies."—"Testimonies," Vol. 5, p. 493.
  14. What is proper for us to bring as we come to the house of the
Lord? 1 Chron. 16:29; Ps. 96:8.
                               [ 23
   15. What instruction is given concerning proper conduct in the
house of God? Eccl. 5:1, 2.
     16. What is said of suitable church attire? 1 Tim. 2:9.
     NOTE.—"All should be taught 10. be neat, clean, and orderly in their
 dress, but not to indulge in that external adorning which is wholly
 inappropriate for. the sanctuary. There should be no display of the
 apparel; for this encourages irreverence. The attention of the people
 is often called to this or that fine article of dress, and thus thoughts
 are intruded that should have no place in the hearts of the worshipers.
 God is to be the subject of thought, the object of worship ; and any-
 thing that attracts the mind from the solemn, sacred service is an
 offense to Him. The parading of bows and ribbons, ruffles and
 feathers, gold and silver ornaments, is a species of idolatry,, and is
 wholly inappropriate for the sacred service of God, where the eye of
 every worshiper should be single to His glory. All matters of dress
 should be strictly guarded, following closely the Bible rule."—Id.,
,p. 499.
    17. What vision was given to the•prophet Isaiah showing how rev-
erently the angels worship in.God's presence? Isa. 6:1-4.
    NOTE.—"There rose up before him [Isaiah] a vision of Jehovah
sitting upon a throne high and lifted up, while the train of His glory
filled the temple. On each side of the throne hovered .the seraphim,
their faces veiled bi adoration, as they ministered before their Maker,
and united in the solemn invocation, 'Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of
hosts; the whole earth is full of His glory,' until post and pillar ,and
cedar gate seemed shaken with the sound, and the house was filled
with their tribute of praise."—"Prophets and Kings," p. 307.

their hearts to draw them to come to Him. Many refuse to be drawn.
Jesus knows who they are. He also knows who gladly. hear His call,

seled, is the only object upon earth upon which Christ bestows His
supreme regard."—"Testimonies to Ministers," p. 49.                  -
    "God has a people in which all heaven is interested, and they are

                                THE LESSON
    1. Who is the leader and teacher of God's people? How does He
teach us? How does He lead? Isa. 48:17, 18; Ps. 32:8.
    NOTE.—"What a God is our God! He rules over His kingdom with
diligence and care. . . . In requiring obedience to the laws of His
kingdom, God gives His people health and happiness, peace and joy.
He teaches them that the perfection of character He requires can be
attained only by becoming familiar with His word."—"Counsels 10.
Teachers," p. 454.
    2. What is the result to those who hearken to and obey the word
of God? Isa. 48:18; Deut. 28:1, 2.
    NOTE.—"So long as they [Adam and Eve] remained loyal to the
divine law, their capacity to know, to enjoy, and to love, would con-
tinually increase. They would be constantly gaining new treasures of
knowledge, discovering fresh springs of happiness, and obtaining
clearer and yet clearer conceptions of the immeasurable, unfailing
love of God."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 51.
   8. What shows that the Lord requires exact obedience? Deut. 4:2;
Rev. 22:18, 19.
   4. To what extent is the indwelling presence of the Spirit able to
bring us into obedience? 2 Cor. 10:5, last part.
    5. What example of obedience has Christ set for us? Phil. 2:8.
                                      [27 ]
     6. At what cost did even Christ learn the lesson of obedience? To
 whom did He become the Author of,salvation? Heb. 5:8, 9.
     7. What was the result of Adam's disobedience? Rom. 5:12, .19,
first part.
     NOTE.—"The tide of woe that flowed from the transgression of
 our first parents, is regarded by many as too awful a consequence for
 so small a sin; and they impeach the wisdom and justice of God in
 His dealings with man. But if they would look more deeply into this
 question, they might discern their error. God created man after His
 own likeness, free from sin. The earth was to he peopled with beings
 only a little lower than the, angels; but their obedience must be
 tested; for God would not peimit the world to be filled with those who
would disi•egard His law. Yet, in . His great mercy, He appointed
Adam no severe test. And the very lightness of the prohibition made
 the sin exceedingly great. If Adam could not bear the smallest. of
tests, he could not have endured a greater trial, had he been intrusted
with higher responsibilities."—Id., pp. 60, 61.
     8. Why did the Lord accept Abel's offering, and disregard the of-
 fering made by Cain? Gen. 4:3-7; Heb. 11:4.
     NOTE.—"The two brothers erected their altars alike, and each
brought an offering. Abel presented a sacrifice from the flock, in ac-
cordance with the Lord's directions. 'And the Lord had respect unto
Abel and to his offering.' Fire flashed from heaven, and consumed
the sacrifice. But Cain, disregarding the Lord's dikeet and explicit
command, presented only an offering of fruit. There was no token
from heaven to show that it was accepted. Abel pleaded. with his
brother to approach God in the divinely prescribed way; but his en-
treaties only made Cain the more determined to follow his own will." •
—Id., pp. 71, 72.
     9. What experience.is related in the life of King Saul that shows
how God regards obedience? What price did Saul pay for his failure
to obey the Lord? 1 Sam. 15:3, 20-23.
     NOTE.—"It is a perilous step to slight the reproofs and warnings
of. God's word or of His Spirit. Many, like Saul, yield to temptation
until they become blind to the true character of sin. They flatter them-
selves that they have had some good object in view, and have done no
wrong in departing from the Lord's requirements. Thus they do de-
spite to the Spirit of grace, until its voice is no longer heard, and they
are left to the delusions which they have chosen."—Id., p. 635.
    10. What sad experience occurred when David was bringing the
ark from Kirjath-jearim? 2 Sam. 6:3-7.
    NOTE.—The Lord had said that the sons of Kohath should bear the
ark, but they were not to touch it lest they should die. (Num. 4:15.)
Uzzah transgressed this commandment; "and God smote him there for
his error [rashness]." 2 Sam. 6:7, margin.
    11. What did David then do? For whom did he send? When the
instruction given for carrying the ark was strictly followed, what was
the result? 1 Chron. 15:11-15.
                                   [ 28
    NOTE.—"We' do not know what great interests may be at stake in
the proving of God. There is no safety except in strict obedience to
the word of God. All His promises are made upon condition of faith
and obedience, and a failure to comply with His commands cuts off
the fulfillment to us of the rich provisions of the Scriptures."—Id.,
p. 621.
   12. What tests of obedience were given to Abraham?
       a. Called to an unknown land. Gen. 12:1-4; Heb. 1.1:8.
       b. Called to offer Isaac as a sacrifice. Gen. 22:1-3; Heb. 11:17.
       c. Why God blessed Abraham. Gen. 22:16-18; 26:4, 5.
   13. In the Sermon on the Mount, what did Jesus represent some as

the last days? Rev. 14:12.

    NOTE.—"Pure air and water, cleanliness, a proper diet, purity of

property of God? What should we therefore do? 1 Cor. 6:19, 20.
    NOTE.—"The work of health reform is the Lord's,means forlessen-
ing suffering in our world and for purifying His church. . . . Absti-
nence from all hurtful hiod and drink is the fruit of true religion. He

destroying indulgences."—"Testimonies," Vol. 9, pp. 112, 113..
    4. What follows in case we willfully defile the body temple? 1 Cor.
3:16, 17.
    5. What food did God give man in the beginning? Gen. 1:29.

earth had been destroyed, did man receive permission to eat flesh. In
choosing man's food in Eden, the Lord showed what was the best diet;
in the choice made for Israel He taught the same lesson."—"Ministry
of Healing," p. 311.                                          •

us by our Creator. These foods, prepared in as simple and natural a
manner as possible, are the most healthful and nourishing."—Id., p. 296.
    "Fruits, grains, and vegetables, prepared in a simple way, free
from spice and grease of all kinds, make, with milk or cream, the most
healthful diet. They impart nourishment ;to the body, and give a
power of endurance and a vigor of.intellect that are not produced by
a stimulating diet."—"Counsels on Health," p. 115.
    7. For what purpose should we eat food? -Eccl. 10:17.
    NOTE.—"There is real common sense in health refoim. People can
not all eat the same things. Some articles of food that are wholesome
and palatable to one person, may be hurtful to another. . . . So it is
impossible to make an unvarying rule by which to regulate every one's
dietetic habits."—Id., pp. 154, 155.

range the functions of the system; to overfeed, and produce satiety,
sickness, or uneasiness; excess in eating and drinking."—Webster.

against. Nature can use no more than is required for building up the
various organs of the body, and excess clogs the system." "Attention
should be given also to the proper combination of foods. By brain
workers and others of sedentary pursuits, but few kinds should be
taken at a4meal."—"Education," p. 205.

5:22, 23; 2 Peter 1:5-7.
    NOTE.—"Temperance in all things of this life is to be taught and
'practiced. Temperance in eating, drinking, sleeping, and dressing is
 one of the grand principles of the religious life. Truth brought into
 the sanctuary of the soul will guide in the treatment of the body.
 Nothing that concerns the health of the human agent is to be regarded
 with indifference. Our eternal welfare depends upon the use we make
 during this life of our time, strength, and influence."—"Testimonies,"
 Vol. 6, p. 375.          •
    10. What warning is given concerning the use of alcoholic drinks?
 Prov. 23:29-32.
   11. Why should tobacco not be used in'any form?
   NoTE.—"Tobacco is a slow, insidious, but most malignant poison.
In whatever form it is used, it tells upon the constitution; it is all the
more dangerous be-Cause its effects are slow, and at first hardly per-
ceptible. It excites and then paralyzes the nerves. It weakens and
clouds the brain."—"Ministry of Healing," pp. 327, 328.
    12. What instruction is given concerning the use of tea and coffee?
    NOTE.—"Tea acts as a stimulant, and, to a certain extent, pro-
duces intoxication. The action of coffee and many other popular
drinks is similar The first effect is exhilarating. The nerves of the
stomach are excited; these convey irritation to the brain, and this 'in
turn is aroused to impart increased action to the heart, and short-lived
energy to the entire system. . . .
    "Tea and coffee do not nourish the system. Their effect is produced
before there has been time for digestion and assimilation, and what
seems to be strength is only nervous excitement. When the influence
of the stimulant is gone, the unnatural force abates, and the result is
a corresponding degree of languor and debility.
    "The continued use of these nerve irritants is followed by head-
ache, wakefulness, palpitation of the heart, indigestion, trembling,
and many other evils; for they wear away the life forces. Tired
nerves need rest and quiet instead of stimulation and over\vork. Na-
ture needs time to recuperate her, exhausted energies."—Id., .pp.
326, 327.

heaven's brightness that has fallen upon the inhabitants of the earth."

nearer the Saviour. The religion of Christ is to be interwoven with all
that they do and say. Their every business transaction is to be fra-
grant with the presence of God."—"Testimonies," Vol. 9, p. 21.

of the most solemn import,—the proclamation of the first, second, and
third angels' messages. There is no other work of so great importance.
They are to allow nothing else to absorb their attention.

John 12:35.
    NOTE.—"Greater light shines upon us than shone upon our fathers.'
We can not be accepted or honored of God in rendering the same serv-

Christ's followers. All who are ordained unto the life of Christ are
ordained to work for the salvation of their fellow men. The same
longing of soul that He felt for the saving of the lost is to be manifest
in them. 'Not all can fill the same place, but for all there is a place

to respond by actual service; every gift is to be employed for the
advancement of His kingdom."—Id., p. 16.

  is to be stirred with compassion for those who are in darkness. From
  all believers light is to be reflected in clear, distinct rays. A work
  similar to that which the Lord did through His delegated messengers
  after the day of Pentecost He is waiting to do to-day. At this time,
  when the end of all things is at hand, should not the zeal of the church
  exceed even that of the early church? Zeal for the glory of God moved
  the disciples to bear witness to the truth with mighty power. Should
, not this zeal fire our hearts with a longing to tell the story of redeem-
  ing love, of Christ and Him crucified? Should not the power of God
  be even more mightily revealed to-day than in the time of the
  apostles?"—"Testimonies," Vol. 7, p. 33.

    NOTE.-"Courtesy, also, is one of the graces of the Spirit, and
should be cultivated by all. It has power to soften natures which
without it would grow hard and rough. Those who profess to be fol-
lowers of Christ, and are at the same time rough, unkind, and un-
courteous, have not learned of Jesus."-"Prophets and Kings," p. 237.

       NOTE.—"Will men and women professing the most solemn truths
  ever borne to mortals, be true to principle? If they would have an
  influence to lead the world to serious reflection, they must be; their
  dress and conversation must be in strict accordance with their peculiar
  faith."—"Testimonies," Vol. 5, p. 128, 129.
      "Dress and conversation reveal that which is most treasured by
  those who claim to be pilgrims and strangers on the earth."—Id., pp.
  188, 189.
  - "Simplicity of dress will make a sensible woman appear to the best
  advantage. We judge of a person's character by the style of dress
  worn. Gaudy apparel betrays vanity and weakness. A modest, godly
  woman will dress modestly. A refined taste, a cultivated mind, will be .
  revealed in the choice of simple and appropriate attire."—"Counsels
  on Health," p. 601'.
       11. Where was .the marriage relation originally established? Gen.
  2:21-24.
       NOTE.—"The family tie is the closest, the most tender and sacred,

  sibilities."—"Ministry of Healing," pp. 356, 357.

       NOTE.—"Happy are the parents whose lives are a true reflection
   of the divine, so that the promises and commands of God awaken in
/ the child gratitude and reverence; the parents whose tenderness and
   justice and long-suffering interpret to the child the love and justice
   and long-suffering of God; and who by teaching the child to love and
   trust and obey them, are teaching him to love and trust and obey his.
   Father in heaven. Parents who impart to the child such a gift have
   endowed him with a treasure more precious than the wealth of all
   ages,—a treasure as enduring as eternity."—"Prophets and Kings,"
   p. 245.
       15. What warning is given to parents -in dealing with their chil-
   dren? How should children be brought up?"Col. 3:21; Eph. 6:4.
       I\ToTE.—"Never shoilld parents cause their children pain by harsh-
   ness or unreasonable exactions. Harshness drives souls into Satan's
   net . . .' Remember that children need not only reproof and correction,
   but encouragement and commendation, the pleasant sunshine of
   kind words."
       "The will of the child must be directed and guided. Save all the
   strength of the will, for the human being needs it all; but give it
   proper direction. Treat it wisely and tenderly, as a sacred treasure.
   Do not hammer it in pieces; but by precept and true example wisely
   fashion and mold it until the child comes to years of responsibility....

   "If milder measures prove insufficient, punishment that will bring
the child to its senses should in love be administered. Frequently one
such correction will be enough for a lifetime, to show the child that he
does not hold the lines of control."—"Counsels to Teachers," pp.
114, 116.
    16. What commandment sets forth the duty of children toward
parents? Ex. 20:12; Eph. 6:2, 3.
    17. How are youth admonished? Prov. 1:8; 30:17.
    NOTE.—"The want of respect for the counsel of a godly parent, is
one of the marked sins of this degenerate age. There are many lives
in our land that are dark and wretched because of one step taken in
the dark. By one act of disobedience, many a youth has blighted his
whole life and weighed down a loving mother's heart with anguish.
God will not hold you guiltless if you follow in this course. By de-
spising the counsel of a God-fearing mother, who would willingly give
her life for her children, you are transgressing the fifth commandment.
You know not where your steps are leading you."—"Testimonies,"
Vol. 5, p. 125.
    18. Who is our perfect pattern? 1 Peter 2:21, 22.
    NOTE.—"Jesus is our example. There are many who dwell with
interest upon the period of His public ministry, while they pass un-
noticed the teaching of His early years. But it is in His home life
that He is the pattern for all children and youth."—"The Desire of
Ages," p. 74.

    [As the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering goes to Malaysia this quarter, we give
this interesting article telling of the wonderful opportunity of furthering the gospel
among the Mohammedans in that field, who are now susceptible to the teachings
of Christianity. Your offering will help to bring the light to those who are now
in darkness.]


      THE ORIENT RETURNING TO CHRIST
                                L. 0. PATTISON                     •


W        HEN Jesus was born into this world, the Orient, in the person of the wise
         men, began to pay Him reverence, and to lay before Him precious gifts of
         gold, frankincense, and myrrh. Unheralded they came, and in like manner
they disappeared. Then for nineteen centuries the Orient seemed to have little
connection with Jesus. But now, to the surprise of the Occident, the Orient is
again beginning to Search for the Lowly One of Nazareth, and to lay before Him
the gift which to Him is the most precious of all—the heart.
    In the Moslem world there are 250,000,000 people who chant their prayers and
bow at appointed times with their faces toward Mecca. There are more than twice
as many Mohammedans as there are people in the United States; and now they
are more open to Christianity than ever before. Followers of Mohammed will to-
day crowd meeting places and listen without prejudice to the message of hope and
salvation. This in itself is a miracle of the last days, and one is led to believe that
a most wonderful change has come over the Mohammedan mind. Leaders of
Islam are becoming interested in Christianity; the third angel's message appeals
to them.
    The rays of the Sun of Righteousness are beginning to penetrate the gloom
that for centuries has enshrouded the teeming millions of Java. There are many
devout followers of Mohammed in this land, but the greater part are Mohamme-
dans in name only. They have ceased to observe the appointed hour of prayer.
They no longer take part in the yearly feast. This class of Mohammedans is
much more susceptible to the teachings of Christianity than the Islam of other
countries.
    In education lies our great hope for these people. An awakening and a desire
for learning are seen among the middle class. Children attend European, Chris-
tian, or Mohammedan schools; it matters not which, just so they learn to read
and write. These schools are filled to their fullest capacity, and other children by
the hundreds and thousands remain without. They have knocked at the door and
asked entrance that they, too, might learn. But there is no room. "Not this
year; perhaps next year you can come," is the response. And so our schools,
though few, are filled with students.
    The older people of the middle class were educated in schools where only the
Koran was taught. They are ahvays pondering over religion and are foremost in
religious discussions. But their sons and daughters are attending Christian
schools, not principally because the gospel is taught, but first of all because they
know that in these schools the teachers are interested in the right development of
character. And these students soon have a desire to become personally acquainted
with their teacher. Thus they are brought into the Sabbath school, with the re-
sult', that they accept the third angel's message.
    In all there are about thirty-two thousand Christians who have been converted
front.Islam. Many of these are followers of our faith. But when we consider the
reman ing 35,000,000 who continue to accept Mohammed as God's prophet, we
feel the need of more spiritual power to hold up Him who said, "I, if I be lifted
up from the earth, will draw all men unto Me." And so we are depending on you,
dea- brethren, this Thirteenth Sabbath, to make it possible for us to open more
schools, ,and to carry on a greater evangelistic work for the followers of Moham-
med here; in Java.
