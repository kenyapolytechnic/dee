      THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
    That the overflows received in connection with the Thirteenth Sabbath
Offerings are of great benefit to the fields to which they go, and are
causing those to rejoice who receive them, is seen by these words from
A. H. Williams, the treasurer of the Southern Asia Division, when
Northeast and Northwest India were the recipients:
    "We certainly are exceedingly grateful to the Sabbath School Depart-
ment, including members of the Sabbath schools everywhere, for the
generous help given us from the overflow for the second quarter of 1926.
The half of the overflow falling to this union as its share will enable us
to establish our doctor in East Bengal to very good advantage."
    This word from H. A. Hansen, the superintendent of the Ceylon Mis-
sion, shows what the overflow the last quarter of 1925 did for them when
South India received part of the offering:
    "When we first started our work in the Kottawa section of Ceylon
about three years ago, there was a large vacant house we very much
wished to secure as a permanent home for our school. We were, therefore,
very happy when it was decided that the portion of the overflow for South
India should all go to Ceylon, for it would enable us to purchase this
property. The place is situated about ten miles out of Colombo, on a good
motor road. The house is large and substantially built. It is in excellent
condition, and quite suitable to our needs. There are seven and one-half
acres of ground, part having fruit trees in bearing, and the rest in new
planting, which, in a few years, will be in full bearing also. We have been
told that it would cost more to erect this house now than we paid for the
entire property. Had it not been for the overflow, we would not have been
able to secure the property."

        What led man to sin?
        How will that which was lost by sin be restored?

notes in the "Youth's Instructor," if the paper is at hand.

                            THE LESSON
                       THE FALL OF LUCIFER
    1. Where and in what manner did sin originate? Ezek. 28:14,15,17.
    2. What was the name of this angel who had been exalted to a high
position in heaven? What did he say in his heart? Isa. 14:12-14.
    NOTE.—"Sin originated with him, who, next to Christ, had been
most honored of God, and was highest in power and glory among the
inhabitants of heaven. Lucifer, 'son of the morning,' was first of the
covering cherubs, holy and undefiled."—"Patriarchs and Prophets,"
p. 35.
    3. What finally took place in heaven? What was Lucifer now
called? Rev. 12:7-9.
    NOTE.—"God, in His great mercy, bore long with Lucifer. He was
not immediately degraded from his exalted station when he first in-
dulged the spirit of discontent, nor even when he began to present his
false claims before the loyal angels. Long was he retained in heaven.
Again and again he was offered pardon, on condition of repentance and
submission. Such efforts as only infinite love and wisdom could devise,
were made to convince him of his error."—"The Great Controversy,"
pp. 495, 496.
                                  [3]
                          THE FALL OF MAN
     4. To whom do all creatures owe their being? John 1:1-3, 14; Col.
1 : 15, 16.
     5. If the first man had maintained faith in God as Creator, and
had respected the Lord's ownership, what would he have proved?
Ps. 119:11; Rom. 12:2.
     6. What did God say of the product of creation week? Gen. 1:31.
     NOTE.—"Though created innocent and holy, our first parents were
not placed beyond the possibility of wrongdoing. God might have
created them without the power to transgress His requirements; but
in that case there could have been no development of character; their
service would not have been voluntary, but forced. Therefore He gave
them the power of choice—the power to yield or to withhold obedience.
And before they could receive in fullness the blessings He" desired to
impart, their love and loyalty must be tested."—"Education," p. 23.
     7. As a free moral agent, what test was man required to pass?
Gen. 2:9, 15-17.
     NCTE.—"While everything in nature is governed by natural laws,
man alone, of all that inhabits the earth, is amenable to moral law. To
man, the crowning work of creation, God has given power to under-
stand His requirements, to comprehend the justice and beneficence of
His law, and its sacred claims upon him; and of man unswerving
obedience is required."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 52.
    8. When God created man, what dominion was given to him? Gen.
1:27, 28.
     NOTE.—"While they remained true to God, Adam and his compan-
ion were to bear rule over the earth. Unlimited control was given them
over every living thing."—Id., p. 50.
     9. Where did Satan appear in the guise of a serpent after he was
cast out of heaven? What did he lead our first parents to do? Gen.
3:1-6.
     NOTE.—Observe that Genesis 2:15-17 shows that man was put into
the garden "to keep it." Evil approached man from without. As long
as sin was outside, man possessed the faculty of recognizing the nature
of it. As soon as it became a part of him, this faculty was weakened.
                     THE LOSS OF THE DOMINION
    10. How did Adam and Eve stand the test that was given them?
Gen. 3:6, 7.
    11. By this disobedience, what condition was brought upon man-
kind? Rom. 5:12.
     NOTE.—"The tide of woe that flowed from the transgression of our
first parents is regarded by many as too awful a consequence for so
small a sin. . . . The very lightness of the prohibition made the sin
exceedingly great. If Adam could not bear the smallest of tests, he
could not have endured a greater trial, had he been intrusted with
higher responsibilities."—Id., pp. 60, 61.
                                  l4]
   12. What did the Lord now do on account of man's disobedience?
Gen. 3:17-19, 23, 24.
    NOTE.—"In order to possess an endless existence, man must con-
tinue to partake of the tree of life. Deprived of this, his vitality would
gradually diminish until life should become extinct."—Id., p. 60.
    13. Whose servant did man become when he sinned? Rom. 6:16;
John 8:34.
              THE RESTORATION OF THE DOMINION
    14. In loving-kindness, what provision had God already made for
man's redemption? Gen. 3:15; John 3:16.
    NOTE.—"The plan for our redemption was not an afterthought, a
plan formulated after the fall of Adam. . . . From the beginning,
God and Christ knew of the apostasy of Satan, and of the fall of man
through the deceptive power of the apostate. God did not ordain that
sin should exist, but He foresaw its existence, and made provision to
meet the terrible emergency."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 22.
    15. How complete was man's redemption to be? To whom will the
lost dominion come? Luke 19:10; Micah 4:8.
    NOTE.—All that the first Adam lost by transgression, Christ, the
second Adam, restored.
    16. Through whom was the promise fulfilled? Gal. 4:4, 5.
    17. Through the death and resurrection of Christ, what prospect
has the believer? Rom. 5:17; 8:1-4.
    18. What condition will then be restored? Rev. 21:1-4; 22:1-5.
    19. What admonition is given to those who look for the fulfillment
of these great promises? 2 Peter 3:13, 14.

plete? John 14: 2, 3.

John 17:24.
    8. What theme occupied an important part in the thoughts, acts,
and preaching of the apostle Paul? Phil. 3:20, 21.
    NOTE.—Read what the Reformers said about the second coming of
Christ.
    Luther believed the day of the Lord to be near. He declared:
" 'The great day is drawing near in which the kingdom of abomina-
tions shall be overthrown.'
    " 'This aged world is not far from its end,' said Melanchthon.
Calvin bids Christians 'not to hesitate, ardently desiring the day of
 Christ's coming as of all events most auspicious;' and declares that
`the whole family of the faithful will keep in view that day.' . . .
    " 'Has not our Lord Jesus carried up our flesh into heaven 1' said
Knox, the Scotch Reformer, 'and shall He not return'? We know that
He shall return, and that with expedition.' Ridley and Latimer, who
laid down their lives for the truth, looked in faith for the Lord's
coming. Ridley wrote: 'The world without doubt—this I do believe,
and therefore I say it—draws to an end. Let us with John, the servant
of God, cry in our hearts unto our Saviour Christ, Come, Lord Jesus,
come.'
    " 'The thoughts of the coming of the Lord,' said Baxter, 'are most
sweet and joyful to me.' It is the work of faith and the character of
His saints to love His appearing and to look for that blessed hope.' "—
"The Great Controversy," p. 303.
                                    [6]
                  THE MANNER OF HIS COMING
   9. What does the Bible reveal concerning the manner of Christ's
second coming? Acts 1:9-11; Luke 21:27.
  10. In whose glory and in whose company will the Lord appear?
Mark 8:38; Matt. 25:31, last part.
   NOTE.—The following description of the coming of Jesus is quoted
from "Early Writings," pp. 286, 287:
   "Soon appeared the great white cloud, upon which sat the Son of
man. When it first appeared in the distance, this cloud, looked very
small The angel said that it was the sign of the Son of man. As it
drew nearer the earth, we could behold the excellent glory and majesty
of Jesus as He rode forth to conquer. A retinue of holy angels, with
bright, glittering crowns upon their heads, escorted Him on His way.
No language can describe the glory of the scene. The living cloud of
majesty and unsurpassed glory came still nearer, and we could clearly
behold the lovely person of Jesus. He did not wear a crown of thorns,
but a crown of glory rested upon His holy brow. Upon His vesture and
thigh was a name written, King of kings, and Lord of lords. His
countenance was as bright as the noonday sun, His eyes were as a
flame of fire, and His feet had the appearance of fine brass. His voice
sounded like many musical instruments. The earth trembled before
Him, the heavens departed as a scroll when it is rolled together, and
every mountain and island were moved out of their places."
               THE MEANING TO THE RIGHTEOUS
   11. What will be heard when the Lord descends from heaven?
Whom does that voice awaken? What will be the experience of the
righteous living? 1 Thess. 4:16-18.
  12. What change will take place in the righteous living and in those
who are raised from the dead? 1 Cor. 15:51-53.
    NOTE.—"The earth mightily shook as the voice of the Son of God
called forth the sleeping saints. They responded to the call, and came
forth clothed with glorious immortality, crying, 'Victory, victory, over
death and the grave! 0 death, where is thy sting? 0 grave, where is
thy victory?' Then the living saints and the risen ones raised their
voices in a long, transporting shout of victory. . . . Oh, what a glori-
ous meeting! Friends whom death had separated were united, never-
more to part."—"Early Writings," p. 287.
                    THE FATE OF THE WICKED
   13. How many of the people of earth will see Christ coming in
glory? Rev. 1:7.
   14. What is said concerning those who "know not God"? 2 Thess.
1:7-9.
   15. Who are mentioned as trying to escape from the presence of
the Lord? What do they say? Rev. 6:15-17.
                              [7 l
                       ENCOURAGEMENT
   16. What will enable us to have confidence when Jesus appears?
1 John 2:28.
   17. What will the Lord say to His people? Matt. 25:34.
   NOTE.—"Better than all the friendship of the world is the friend-
ship of Christ's redeemed. Better than a title to the noblest palace on
earth is a title to the mansions our Lord has gone to prepare. And
better than all the words of earthly praise, will be the Saviour's words
to His faithful servants, 'Come, ye blessed of My Father, inherit the
kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.' "—
"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 374.

                           THE LESSON
                        JESUS GAVE SIGNS
    1. Why did the Lord on one occasion reprove the Pharisees, and
call them "hypocrites"? Matt. 16: 1-3.
    NOTE.—Jesus gave His disciples and the people many signs, and
pointed to them as a witness of His Messiahship. He did not reprove
them for asking for signs, but rather for ignoring the signs that were
already given. He gave His disciples signs that were to indicate that
His glorious appearing was drawing near. Luke 21:25-28. After His
resurrection, He rebuked two of His disciples while on the way, to
Emmaus. Luke 24:25, 26. Christ wishes His people to understand the
prophecies, and to consider every true sign of the times.
                                 18 1
   2. How will the attention of the world be drawn to the great and
terrible day of the Lord? Joel 2:30, 31.

    3. One day as Jesus was seated on the Mount of Olives, what ques-
tion did the disciples ask? Matt. 24:3.
  4. What record does Luke give of Jesus' answer to their question?
Luke 21:25-27.
   5. At what particular time were the signs in the sun, moon, and

     NOTE.—The days of tribulation referred to are the 1260 years of
papal supremacy which, according to Daniel 7:25 and Revelation
13:2-7, began in 538 A. D., and ended in 1798.
     "Christ's prophecy points out approximately the time when the
first of the signs that He gave, the darkening of the sun, should ap-
pear,—'immediately after the tribulation of those days.' And the
'great earthquake' of John's vision [Rev. 6:12] was to precede this
sign• in the heavens.
     "The Reformation of the sixteenth century began to cut short the
days of tribulation; but some countries shut out the liberalizing influ-
ences of the word of God, and there the persecution continued. . . .
     "But by the middle of the century [1750], the era of enlightenment
and the force of world opinion, in the good providence of God, had so
permeated the Catholic states of Europe that general violent persecu-
tion had ceased. . . .
     "From these times, then, we are to scan the record of history to
learn if the appointed signs began to appear. As we look, we find the
events recorded, following on in the order predicted:
     "1. The Lisbon earthquake, of 1755.
     "2. The dark day, of 1780.
     "3. The falling stars, of 1833."—"Our Day in the Light of Pruh-
ecy," W. A. Spicer, pp. 75, 77.
     "The Dark Day, May 19, 1780—so. called on account of a remark-
able darkness on that day extending over all New England. In some
 places, persons could not see to read common print in the open air for
several hours together. Birds sang their evening songs, disappeared,
and became silent; fowls went to roost; cattle sought the barnyard;
 and candles were lighted in the houses. . . . The true cause of this
 remarkable phenomenon is not known."—Noah Webster's Dictionary
 (edition 1869).
     "The year 1833 is memorable for the most magnificent display [of
 falling meteors] on record. This was on the same night of November
 [13] also, and was visible over all the United States, and over a part
 of Mexico, and the West India Islands."—The American Cyclopedia,
 art. "Meteor."
     "The falling stars did not come as if from several trees shaken, but
 from one. Those which appeared in the east fell toward the east; those
 which appeared in the north fell toward the north; those which ap-
 peared in the west fell toward the west; and those which appeared in
                                   t9l
the south (for I went out of my residence into the park) fell toward
the south; and they fell, not as the ripe fruit falls; far from it; but
they flew, they were cast, like the unripe fig, which at first refuses to
leave the branch; and when it does break its hold, flies swiftly, straight
off, descending; and in the multitude falling, some cross the track of
others, as they are thrown with more or less force."—A correspondent
in the New York Journal of Commerce, Vol. 8, No. 534, Saturday
morning, Nov. 14, 1833.
    6. How accurately have the prophets foretold these events? Isa.
13:9, 10.
                           EARTHQUAKES
    7. What other remarkable signs of His coming are given? Matt.
24:7, last part.
    NOTE.—"In fulfillment of this prophecy given by Christ, statistics
issued by the British Association for the Advancement of Science re-
veal that there has been, during century after century of the Christian
era, a most striking increase of destructive earthquakes. Not including
small earthquakes, but only those which have caused destruction of life
and property, these statistics give the number of destructive earth-
quakes from the first to the twentieth century. Beginning with fifteen
in the first century, there is shown a gradual increase to 115 in the
thirteenth century. From that time the list is as follows:
              Fourteenth century                     137

   "Certainly these figures bear out the prophecy of our Lord. And
they do not include the frightfully destructive earthquakes of this pres-
ent century, such as those of San Francisco and Japan."—"Twelve
Great Signs," Carlyle B. Haynes, pp. 77, 78.

                    INCREASE OF KNOWLEDGE
    8. What does the prophet say of the increase of knowledge in the
time of the end? Dan. 1'x:4.
    NOTE.—"Especially in our days, by the enlightenment of the Holy
Spirit, knowledge has increased regarding the prophecies. . . . Ac-
cording to Daniel 12: 4, that is a sign that the end is near. From this
it would appear that to keep in health spiritually, one should keep fully
informed regarding the last days, and therefore the doctrine of the end
must be taught with all clearness."—Pastor E. Miihe, in "Is the End
Near?" pp. 6, 7, 19. (Translated from the German.)
    The most remarkable thing of our time is the rapid progress in
science, education, and invention. Some of the more important are:
Balloon 1798, gaslight 1798, steel pen 1803, lucifer match 1829, elec-
tric telegraph 1837, photography 1839, sewing machine 1846, subma-
rine cable 1851, typewriter 1868, telephone 1876, electric railway 1879,
                                   10l
linotype 1885, Röntgen, or X ray, 1895, wireless telegraphy 1895,
airplane 1903. It will be noticed that none of these inventions antedate
1798. But suddenly with the opening of the nineteenth century, the
world awoke from its long sleep, and a new era dawned,—the time of
the end, when knowledge was to be increased.
   9. What is given as a most important sign of Christ's coming?
Matt. 24:14; Rev. 14:6-12.
   NOTE.—In the last ten years, from 1915-1925, we have sent out
2,046 new missionaries, and are working in 124 countries and in 252
languages.

    The millennium follows the close of the gospel age, and precedes the setting up, of the everlasting king-
dom of God on earth.
    It comprehends what in the Scriptures is frequently spoken of as "the day of the Lord."
    It is bounded at each end by a resurrection.
    Its beginning is marked by the pouring out of the seven last plagues, the second coming of Christ, the
resurrection of the righteous dead, the binding of Satan, and the translation of the saints to heaven; and
its close, by the descent of the New Jerusalem, with Christ and the saints, from heaven, the resurrection of
the wicked dead, the loosing of Satan, and the final destruction of the wicked.
    During the one thousand years the earth lies desolate; Satan and his angels are confined here; and the
saints, with Christ, sit in judgment on the wicked, preparatory to their final punishment.
    The wicked dead are then raised; Satan is loosed for a little season, and he and the host of the wicked
encompass the camp of the saints and the holy city, when fire comes down from God out of heaven and devours
them. The earth is cleansed by the same fire that destroys the wicked, and, renewed, becomes the eternal
abode of the saints.
    The- millennium is one of "the ages to come." Its close will mark the beginning of the new earth state.

                                THE LESSON
EVENTS MARKING THE BEGINNING OF THE THOUSAND YEARS
    1. What portion of Scripture clearly describes a millennium, or a
thousand-year period? Revelation 20.
    NomE.—The word "millennium" is from two Latin words, "milk,"
thousand, and "annus," year, and means a thousand years.
    2. What great events mark the beginning of the thousand years?
1 Thess. 4:16, 17.
    3. What class only have part in the first resurrection? Rev. 20:6.
    4. What is said of the wicked at that time? 2 Thess. 2:8; 1:8.
    5. What does the prophet John say will be the experience of Satan?
Rev. 20:1-3.
    NomE.—The word here rendered "bottomless pit" is in other versions
translated "abyss," meaning a place of darkness and desolation. No
more fitting term could be found to describe the condition of the earth
during the thousand years. "Here is to be the home of Satan with his
evil angels for a thousand years. Limited to the earth, he will not have
access to other worlds, to tempt and annoy those who have never fallen.
It is in this sense that he is bound; there are none remaining, upon
whom he can exercise his power. He. is wholly cut off from the work
of deception and ruin which for so many centuries has been his sole
delight."—"The Great Controversy," p. 659.
                                      [ 13
             EVENTS DURING THE THOUSAND YEARS
   6. Where do the saints meet the Lord? 1 Thess. 4:17.
   7. Where are the saints seen by the prophet? What are they doing
there? Rev. 19:1; 20:4.
   8. Whom does the apostle Paul say the saints are to judge? 1 Cor.
6:1-3.
   9. What prophecy supports the apostle's statement? Dan. 7:21, 22.
   NOTE,—This judgment will not be to determine who are the right-
eous, for this has previously been determined, but it will consist in
apportioning the measure of punishment due to the lost. This work
will bring to light the hidden things, and the justice and mercy of God
will be fully seen in all His dealings with the children of men.
   10. What will then be the condition of the earth? Jer. 4:23-25;
25:33; Zeph. 3:6.
    11. With what is Satan occupied during this time?
    Answer.—"For a thousand years, Satan will wander to and fro in
the desolate earth, to behold the results of his rebellion against the law
of God. During this time his sufferings are intense. Since his fall, his
life of unceasing activity has banished reflection; but he is now de-
prived of his power and left to contemplate the part which he has acted
since first he rebelled against the government of heaven, and to look
forward with trembling and terror to the dreadful future, when he
must suffer for all the evil that he has done, and be punished for the
sins that he has caused to be committed."—"The Great Controversy,"
p. 660.
    EVENTS MARKING THE END OF THE THOUSAND YEARS
    12. What resurrection takes place at the end of the thousand years?
Rev. 20:5, first part.
    NOTE.—The millennium period is marked at both its beginning and
its close by a resurrection. The righteous dead are raised at the begin-
ning of the millennium, the wicked dead at the close. The millennium
therefore begins at the second coming of the Lord. During the thou-
sand years the earth will be in a chaotic condition, and without human
inhabitants.
   13. What opportunity does Satan again have? Rev. 20:7, 8.
   14. How is the place prepared upon which the New Jerusalem shall
descend? Zech. 14:4, 5.
   15. How does the prophet describe the descent of the Holy City?
Rev. 21:2.
    NOTE.—"Christ descends upon the Mount of Olives, whence, after
His resurrection, He ascended, and where angels repeated the promise
of His return. . . . As the New Jerusalem, in its dazzling splendor,
comes down out of heaven, it rests upon the place purified and made
ready to receive it, and Christ, with His people and the angels, enters
the holy city."—"The Great Controversy," pp. 662, 663.
                                  [ 14
    16. What will Satan try once more to do? What will be his end?
Rev. 20:9, 10.
    NorE.—"Now Satan prepares for a last mighty struggle for the
supremacy. . . . He proposes to lead them against the camp of the
saints, and to take possession of the city of . God. . . . Satan, the
mightiest of warriors, leads the van, and his angels unite their forces
for this final struggle. Kings and warriors are in his train, and the
multitudes follow in vast companies, each under its appointed leader.
With military precision, the serried ranks advance over the earth's
broken and uneven surface to the city of God. By command of Jesus,
the gates of the New Jerusalem are closed, and the armies of Satan
surround the city, and make ready for the onset."—Id., pp. 663, 664.
    "Fire comes down from God out of heaven. The earth is broken up.
The weapons concealed in its depths are drawn forth. Devouring flames
burst from every yawning chasm. The very rocks are on fire. . . .
In the cleansing flames the wicked are at last destroyed, root and
branch,—Satan the root, his followers the branches. The full penalty
of the law has been visited; the demands of justice have been met; and
heaven and earth, beholding, declare the righteousness of Jehovah.
Satan's work of ruin is forever ended."—Id., pp. 672, 673.
    17. When every trace of sin is removed, what promise will be ful-
filled? 2 Peter 3:13; Rev. 21:1; Isa. 65:17.
                 THE LESSON FOR OUR TIME
   18. Against what does the Lord warn us? 1 Thess. 5:2-4.
   19. What will the nations say in the last days? Micah 4:2, 3.
   20. But how will it be in reality? Joel 3:9, 10.
   NOTE.—The Bible tells only of a millennium during the period that
the judgment of the wicked is taking place in heaven, and at this time
the earth is desolate. Christendom has the false idea that during this
thousand years there will be a time of peace, and many will be con-
verted. The Lord warns against this.

17-19; 20:1-3.
    2. What indicates that the law reveals the perfect will of God?
Ps. 19:7,10.

and wisdom."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 52.
    3. What does Nehemiah say of the character of the law of God?
Neh. 9:13.
    NOTE.— That the law of God is a revelation of His character is

                    RELATION OF SIN TO THE LAW
    4. How is sin defined in the Scriptures? 1 John 3:4.
   5. What precious assurance is given the believing sinner? Rom.
5:20; 6:14.
   6. What is the consequence of transgression of a single portion of
the law? James 2:10.
   NOTE.—"That the law which was spoken by God's own voice is
faulty, that some specification has been set aside, is the claim which
Satan now puts forward. It is the last great deception that he will
                                      [16 ]
bring upon the world. He needs not to assail the whole law; if he can
lead men to disregard one precept, his purpose is gained."—"The De-
sire of Ages," p. 763.
    7. What is the punishment for breaking the law? How only may
eternal life be gained? Rom. 6:23.
         •   RELATION OF THE LAW TO THE GOSPEL
    8. What purpose does the law of God serve? Rom. 3:20.
    9. What illustration is used to show how sin is revealed? James
1:23-25.
    NOTE.—The mirror shows us how we look. If our appearance is not
right, it reveals the fault, but it does not take away a single defect.
So the law of God points out the wrongs in our Iife by setting the true
standard before us. To get rid of the sin which is revealed by the law,
we go to Jesus for pardon and cleansing.
    10. How was Paul's sin revealed to him? Rom. 7:7.
    11. How are the purpose of the law and the purpose of the gospel
set forth in a single scripture? Gal. 3:24.
    12. How should faith in Christ cause one to regard the law of God?
Rom. 3:31.
    13. How is God's righteousness set forth for us? How may we
obtain it? Verses 21-26.
    NOTE.—The law demands a perfect righteousness. The sinner can
present only filthy rags. Our blessed Redeemer comes to the rescue,
and offers His perfect righteousness, wrought out in human life,—
complete obedience to all the commandments of God. God accepts this
in behalf of the sinner. The sinner lays hold of it by faith, and is
secure. •
    14. What experience is necessary in order to keep the law? Heb.
8:10; Gal. 2:20.
                        EXALTING THE LAW
    15. How did Jesus exalt the law of God? Matt. 5:.17-19.
    NOTE. "It is a lie to make the statement that when Christ referred
to the nonpassing away of the law, He had reference to the law of
Moses, for, as every one knows, He spoke only of the Ten Command-
ments. If the Ten Commandments should be called the law of Moses,
then Moses came too late, for they were in existence long before Moses,
before Abraham, and before all the patriarchs."—"Luther's Letter to
a Friend."
    16. What is more necessary than ceremonies or rituals? Gal. 6:15;
5:6; 1 Cor. 7:19.
    NOTE.—If we compare these three references, we find the expres-
sion identical in each of the first sentences. We see then that the
gospel creates a new commandment-keeping creature in whom faith
works by love.
   17. What two great commandments briefly summarize the law of
God? Matt. 22:36-40.
   18. What is the whole duty of man declared to be? Eccl. 12:13.
   19. Who only will enter into the city of God? Rev. 22:14.
   NoTE.—To summarize the essentials in studying the law of God,
we should consider the following:
   a. The law reveals sin, as a mirror reveals an imperfection. James
1:23-25.
   b. It condemns sin, thus evidencing its own righteousness. Rom.
7:9-12.
   c. It is an agency in conversion. Ps. 19:7.
   d. It witnesses to the character of the righteousness of Christ,
which has been manifested to us. Rom. 3:21.
   e. It is the standard of righteousness. Isa. 51:7.
   f. It will be the standard in the final judgment. James 2:9-12;
Eccl. 12:13, 14.

        Can man make a day holy.
        Is it worth while to be particular about which day one observes as the
Sabbath?
        Is popular custom a safe guide in matters of religion?
     7. Review the lesson by asking questions from any of the lesson papers.
Read the notes in the "Youth's Instructor," if the paper is available.
                                THE LESSON
                 THE INSTITUTION OF THE SABBATH
    1.When was the Sabbath instituted? Gen. 2:1-3.
   NOTE.—The Sabbath is founded on the facts of creation. The.
Creator worked six days, rested on the seventh, then blessed and hal-
                                f. 18 ]
lowed the seventh day. These facts are unchangeable; therefore the
Sabbath is unchangeable.
   2. Who is the Creator? Eph. 3:9; Col. 1:16; John 1:1-3; Heb.
1:1,2.
   3. By what three distinct acts was the Sabbath made?
    Answer.—Three distinct acts of God are here mentioned, distin-
guishing the seventh day from the other six days of the week as a
perpetual memorial of God's creative work.
    a. God Himself rested on the Sabbath day from His work of
creation.
    b. He blessed it, making it an inexhaustible fountain of blessing
for man.
    c. He sanctified it, thus setting it apart for holy use.
    "Sanctify: To make sacred or holy; to set apart to a holy or reli-
gious use."—Webster.
    The Hebrew word which is translated "sanctify" means "to declare
holy,' to "consecrate," or to "separate." The sanctification of the sev-
enth day involved its separation from the other days of the week for
holy use, and a declaration to keep it holy.
    4. Which of these three acts formed the basis of Sabbath keeping?
Heb. 4:4; Ex. 31:17.
    NOTE.—As an earthly workman rests after his work is satisfac-
torily completed, and as he looks at its perfection, he refreshes him-
self; so also the heavenly Workman not only rested after His perfect
work of creation, but also as He looked upon it and found it "very
good," and saw in it the reflection of His glory and the image of His
person, He Himself was refreshed with this rest.
    The blessing of God means something. God said to Abraham, "I
will bless thee, . . and thou shalt be a blessing," and this blessing
came upon "all families of the earth." Gen. 12:2, 3. The blessing of
God exalts the blessed one above his fellows. This applies also to the
Sabbath day. The Sabbath was exalted above all other days of the
week. It was blessed that it might be a blessing.
THE SABBATH A. MEMORIAL OF CREATION AND REDEMPTION,
            AND A SIGN OF SANCTIFICATION
    5. Of what does the Sabbath remind us each week? Ex. 20:8-11;
Ps. 111:2-4.
    NOTE.—The division of time into months and years is indicated by
nature. But not so with the week. This division is made only by the
Sabbath. The fact that from ancient times there were recognized
periods of seven days, or a week, shows that the Sabbath was known
and kept.
   6. Of what else is the Sabbath a sign? 2 Cor. 5:17.
   NOTE.—According to Isaiah 43:1, our Creator is also our Re-
deemer. As redemption is also a new creation, the Sabbath is also a
sign of our redemption.
                                [ 19]
     7. What may we know anew each Sabbath day? Therefore of what
is the Sabbath also a sign? Ezek. 20:12, 20.
     NomE.—"The Sabbath is the appropriate sign or memorial of the
creative power of God wherever displayed, whether in creation, deliv-
erance from human bondage, or deliverance from the slavery of sin ;
it is to be kept as a sign of the work of sanctification."—"Bible Read-
ings," p. 420.
     8. Through whom do we have sanctification? 1 Cor. 1:30.
     NOTE.—"As the Sabbath is a sign or memorial of sanctification, and
as Christ is the one through whom the work of sanctification is accom-
plished, the Sabbath is a sign or memorial of what Christ is to the
believer. Through the Sabbath, therefore, God designed that the be-
liever and Christ should be very closely linked together."—Ibid.
   9. For how long will the Sabbath remain a sign between God and
His people? Ex. 31:16, 17.
         SABBATH KEEPING IN THE OLD TESTAMENT
   10. By what means was Sabbath observance emphasized in ancient
times?
   Answer.—a. When Israel journeyed in the wilderness. Ex.16 :22-26.
   b. Spoken by God as part of His law. Ex. 20:8-1.1.
   c. Warnings to the people in Jerusalem. Neli. 13:19; Ter. 17:21.
        CHRIST AND THE APOSTLES AS OUR EXAMPLE
  11. What example has Jesus left us concerning Sabbath keeping?
Luke 4:16.
   12. Who is the Lord of the Sabbath? Mark 2:27, 28.
   13. Even after the crucifixion, which day did the women who fol-
lowed Jesus observe as the Sabbath? Luke 23:55, 56.
    14. What was the custom of the apostles in the matter of Sabbath
observance?
    Answer.—a. Paul and Barnabas at Antioch. Acts 13 :14, 15, 42, 44.
    b. Paul at Philippi. Acts 16:13.
    c. Paul's custom. Acts 17:1, 2.
    d. Paul at Corinth. Acts 18:1-4, 11.
    NOTE.—Here we see that Paul preached in Corinth on many Sab-
baths. But we have only one meeting recorded as taking place on the
first day of the week, and this was an evening meeting held after the
Sabbath. Acts 20:7-12.
    "The History of the Sabbath," by J. N. Andrews and L. R. Con-
radi, shows that in all times since the days of the apostles, including
the Dark Ages, there have been those who kept the true Sabbath of
the Lord.
                    THE SABBATH UNCHANGED
    15. Does the Bible record indicate that there was any controversy
in apostolic times as to which day was the Sabbath?
    Answer.—The absolute silence of the New Testament on Sunday
sacredness must be a great surprise to those who look for evidence to
                                 [ 20
justify Sunday observance. Nowhere is any sacred title given to the
first day of the week. No command is given to observe it in any way.
No Sabbatic observance of it is anywhere recorded. This silence would
be inexplicable if any such innovation as the observance of Sunday as
the Sabbath had been suggested or practiced in the church during that
period.
    16. What shows that the Sabbath will be remembered and observed
in the new earth week by week? Isa. 66:22, 23.



                               LESSON 7

bath. Contrast it with the foundation upon-which the observance of Sunday rests.
Children may take part in the study.
     6. Tell the story of the lesson, bringing out details, each member of the
family taking part. Discuss the experience of Daniel in obeying God in spite of
a king's decree. (See Daniel 6.) Study the experience of Peter and the other

     7. Review the lesson, by asking questions from any of the lesson papers.
Read the notes in the "Youth's Instructor," if the paper is at hand.

                               THE LESSON
                     THE SABBATH AND THE LAW
   1. Of what is the Sabbath commandment a part?—Answer: The
law of God. Ex. 20:8-11.
   2. What does God say concerning His law? Luke 16:17; Deut. 4:2.
   3. According to prophecy, what was to be Christ's attitude toward
the law? Isa. 42:21.
   4. In His first recorded discourse, what did Christ say of the law?
Matt. 5:17-19.
   NoTE.—From this it is evident that Jesus had no thought of chang-
ing any of the Ten Commandments. "One of these commands the
                                     [ 21 ]
observance of the seventh day as the Sabbath. But the practice of most
Christians is different; they keep the first day of the week instead,
many of them believing that Christ changed the Sabbath. But, from
His own words, we see that He came for no such purpose. The respon-
sibility for this change must therefore be looked for elsewhere."—
"Bible Readings for the Home Circle," p. 440.
                     AN EVIL WORK FORETOLD
    5. What did God through the prophet Daniel say that the power
represented by the little horn would think to do? Dan. 7:25.
    NO'TB.—The papacy has fulfilled this prophecy by doing exactly the
work described by the prophet Daniel. The names given to Christ in
the Bible are, in Catholic books, given to the pope. The pope is called
the "shepherd," the "husbandman," "another God on earth," "Lord
God the pope," and "King of kings and Lord of lords."
    The papacy, during the Dark Ages, has persecuted and worn out the
saints of God by fire, sword, wild beasts, and every form of death that
evil men could invent. The papacy has also thought to change the law
of God, but it could only "think" to do this, for the commandments
can not really be changed.
   6. What did the apostle say the "man of sin" would do? 2 Thess.
2:3, 4.
   NOTE.—There is only one way by which any power could exalt itself
above God, and that is by assuming to change the law of God, and to
require obedience to its own law instead of to God's law.
    7. What part of the law of God has the papacy thought especially
to change? Dan. 7:25, third clause.
    NOTE.—"They [the Catholics] allege the Sabbath changed into
Sunday, the Lord's day, contrary to the Decalogue, as it appears;
neither is there any example more boasted of than the changing of the
Sabbath day. Great, say they, is the power and authority of the
church, since it dispensed with one of the Ten Commandments."—
Augsburg Confession, Art. XX VI11.
   8. Which of the Ten Commandments relates to God's time? Ex.
20:8-11.
                 THE CLAIMS OF THE PAPACY
    9. Who instituted the first law requiring the keeping of Sunday?
    Answer.—"The earliest recognition of the observance of Sunday as
a legal duty is a constitution of Constantine in 321 A. D., enacting
that all courts of justice, inhabitants of towns and workshops were
to be at rest on Sunday (venerabili die Solis), with an exception in
favor of those engaged in agricultural labor."—Encyclopedia Britan-
nica, ninth edition, article "Sunday."
   10. What action concerning the Sabbath was taken by the Council
of Laodicea about A. D. 364?
   Answer.—"Christians shall not Judaize and be idle on Saturday
/Sebbath, original], but shall work on that day. . . . If, however,
                                22
they are found Judaizing [keeping the Bible Sabbath], they shall be
shut out from Christ."—"A History of the Church Councils," Chas. J.
Hefele, Vol. 2, p. 316.
    11. What does the papacy claim with reference to the Sabbath com-
mandment?
    Answer.—"Ques.--Have you any other way of proving that the
church has power to institute festivals of precept?
    "Ans.—Had she not such power, she could not have done that in
which all modern religionists agree with her,—she could not have sub-
stituted the observance of Sunday the first day of the week, for the
observance of Saturday the seventh day, a change for which there is
no Scriptural authority."—"A Doctrinal Catechism," Rev. Stephen
Keenan, p. 174.
    "You may read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation, and you will
not find a, single line authorizing the sanctification of Sunday. The
Scriptures enforce the religious observance of Saturday, a day which
we never sanctify."—"The Faith of Our Fathers," James Cardinal
Gibbons, p. 111.
   12. What do Protestant writers say concerning the Sabbath?
   Answer.—"Neither Christ, nor His apostles, nor the first Christians
celebrated the first day of the week instead of the seventh as the Sab-
bath."—New York Weekly Tribune, May 24, 1900.
   "The Scriptures nowhere call the first day of the week the Sab-
bath. . . . There is no Scriptural authority for so doing; nor of course
any Scriptural obligation."—The Watchman (Baptist).
   "The Sabbath was founded on a specific, divine command. We can
plead no such command for the observance of Sunday. . . . There is
not a single line in the New Testament to suggest that we incur any
penalty by violating the supposed sanctity of Sunday."—Dr. R. W.
Dale (British Congregationalist).
    13. What do Catholics say about the observance of Sunday by
Protestants?
    Answer.—"It was the Catholic Church which, by the authority of
Jesus Christ, has transferred this rest to the Sunday in remembrance
of the resurrection of. our Lord. Thus the observance of Sunday by
the Protestants is an homage they pay, in spite of themselves, to the
authority of the [Catholic] church."—"Plain Talk About the Protes-
tantism of To-day," by Mgr. Segur, p. 213.
                        OBEDIENCE TO GOD
   14. How do we show whom we serve? Rom. 6:16.
   15. What kind of worship does the Saviour call that which is not
according to God's commandments? Matt. 15:9.
   16. What difference was there between Elijah and the other
prophets of his time? What appeal did Elijah make to the people?
1 Kings 18:18-22.
   NOTE.—Moloch and Kamosch (Chemosh) are only other names for
Baal, the sun god.
                             [23 1
    17. Which of the commandments will be the great test in the time
of the end?
    Answer.—"The Sabbath will be the great test of loyalty; for it is
the point of truth especially controverted."—"The Great Controversy,"
p. 605.

     6. Tell the lesson as a story, each member of the family taking part. Dis-
cuss the following :
        Is my practice in Sabbath keeping in harmony with the instruction of the
word of God?
        In what respect should I improve?
        Is it worth while for me to do this?
    Read "Testimonies," Vol. 6, pp. 349-351.
     7. Review the lesson, asking questions from any of the lesson sheets. Read

                          A SOLEMN MESSAGE .
    I. What solemn message has God given for the last days? What
command is given in this message? Rev. 14:6, 7.
   2. To what does the fear of the Lord lead? Eccl. 12:13.
   NOTE.—The fear of God, reverence, is to be found only in a tender,
humble heart, a heart that recognizes its 'own nothingness and God's
perfection.                                  •
   3. What prominent characteristics of the people of God are devel-
oped by the third angel's message? Rev. 14:12.

rejected? Jer. 6:16-19.
                                      24
   NOTE.—The words of Jeremiah doubtless refer to the Israel of that
time, and were spoken to them. But they also apply to our time, and
were written for our admonition.
   "It is only as the law of God is restored to its rightful position that
there can be a revival of primitive faith and godliness among His pro-
fessed people. Jer. 6 :16."—"The Great Controversy," p. 478.
    6. With what does the Lord compare this willful transgression of
His law? Isa. 30:8-13. Note especially verse 13.
                       A BLESSING PROMISED

    9. What work will be done by those who thus observe the Sabbath
of the Lord? What will they be called? Verse 12.
    NOTE.—"To all who receive the Sabbath as a sign of Christ's cre-
ative and redeeming power, it will be a delight. Seeing Christ in it,
they delight themselves in Him."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 289.
                 THE BEGINNING OF THE SABBATH
    10. What day is pointed out specifically as the one on which we are
to make preparation for the Sabbath? Ex. 16:22, 23; Luke 23:54.
     NOTE.—"All through the week we are to have the Sabbath in mind,
and be making preparation to keep it according to the commandment."
—"Testimonies," Vol. 6, p. 363.
     "All through the week the keeping holy of the Sabbath day is to be
remembered, or borne in mind. No business contracts or arrangements
are to be made, no manner of living indulged in, which will prevent or
interfere with the proper or holy observance of the day when it comes."
—"Bible Readings for the Home Circle," p. 425.
     11. For what purpose are we to remember the Sabbath day? Who
made the Sabbath holy? Ex. 20:8-11.
     NovE.—God made the Sabbath day holy; we can keep it holy by
properly observing it, with a heart made holy by the grace of God. As
it is God's presence that makes anything holy, so we should recognize
His presence in the Sabbath, His blessing upon it, and His sanctifica-
tion of it.
     12. According to the Bible, when does the Sabbath begin? Lev.
23:32.
     NoTE.—It will be noted that in the record of creation, the evening

morning were the first day," etc.
     13. What marks the beginning of the "evening"? Mark 1:32, first
part.
     14. At what time should all be ready to keep the Sabbath? How
 may we be led to break the true spirit of the rest day on Sabbath
morning?
                                   [25 7
    Answer.—"Before the setting of the sun, let the members of the
family assemble to read God's Word, to sing and pray. There is need
of reform here, for many have been remiss. We need to confess to God
and to one another. . .
    "Let not the precious hours of the Sabbath be wasted in bed. On
Sabbath morning the family should be astir early. If they rise late,
there is confusion and bustle in preparing for breakfast and Sabbath
school. There is hurrying, jostling, and impatience. Thus unholy feel-
ings come into the home. The Sabbath, thus desecrated, becomes a
weariness, and its coming is dreaded rather than loved."—"Testi-
monies," Vol. 6, pp. 356, 357.
                         SABBATH KEEPING
    15. What indicates that there should be public worship on the Sab-
bath? Lev. 23:3; Heb. 10:25.
    16. What question about Sabbath keeping did the Jews once ask
Jesus? What was His reply, both in precept and in example? Matt.
12 : 10-13.
    17. What do the works of God declare? Ps. 19:1-3.
    NomE.—God designed that the Sabbath should direct the minds of
men to His created works, and through these to Him, the Creator.
Nature itself speaks to our senses, telling us that there is a God, the
Creator and supreme Ruler of the universe.
    18. What should the Sabbath be to us in comparison with other
days?
    Answer.—The Sabbath should bring us a double blessing. Although
the Lord has a blessing ready each day for us, on the Sabbath we may
expect a special blessing. In this manner our life in God will grow
week by week. Each Sabbath will bring us to a higher standard, and
nearer to God.

    1. What did God declare to be the penalty for disobedience? Gen.
2:16, 17; Rom. 6:23.
    NOTE.—"Immortality, promised to man on condition of obedience,
had been forfeited by transgression. Adam could not transmit to his
posterity that which he did not possess; and there could have been no
hope for the fallen race, had not God, by the sacrifice of His Son,
brought immortality within their reach."—"The Great Controversy,"
p. 533.
   2. What was done to prevent sinners from living forever? Gen.
3:22-24.
    NOTE.—"The warning given to our first parents—'In the day that
thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die'—did not imply that they were
to die on the very day when they partook of the forbidden fruit. But
on that day the irrevocable sentence would be pronounced."—"Patri-
archs and Prophets," p. 60.
  3. What sentence passed upon all men when sin entered this world?
Rom. 5:12.
   4. Who only has immortality? 1 Tim. 6:15, 16.

    17. How can man appropriate the power of the resurrection of
Christ? John 5:24.
    NOTE.—To know Christ and the power of His resurrection, is to
know Him here and now as a personal Saviour from sin—that is, from
the practice of sin in our daily experience. And knowing salvation
from sin—that is, from sinning—we know the power of His resurrec-
tion. (See 2 Cor. 4:6.)
    18.-In what sure hope may the faithful die? 1 Thess. 4:14-16;
2 Cor. 4:14.
   19. What should be our constant endeavor? Phil. 3:10, 11, 20, 21.

                       THE LESSON
        NECESSITY FOR THE INVESTIGATIVE JUDGMENT
   1. Into what two classes has humanity divided itself since the fall
of man? What has become necessary because of this division? Eccl.
3:16, 17.
   2. How many must meet the test of the judgment? 2 Cor.
   3. What has God appointed? Acts 17:31.
   4. What will be taken into account in the investigation? Eccl.
12:14; Matt. 12:36, 37.
                  THE TIME OF THE JUDGMENT
    5. What warning is given to the world when the time of the judg-
ment comes? Rev. 14:6, 7.
    NOTE.—It will be noticed that when the time comes for this mes-
sage to go to the world proclaiming the judgment, the announcement
is, "The hour of His judgment is come."
   6. What did God's Spirit reveal concerning those with whom the
judgment would begin? 1 Peter 4:17.
   7. Who belong to the house of God? Heb. 3:6.
    8. What service in the earthly sanctuary was a type of the investi-
gative judgment? Lev. 16:29-34.
    NOTE.—The services in the earthly sanctuary were a type of the
work in the heavenly sanctuary. Each year a service of cleansing was
held, called "the day of atonement." This service was a type of the
cleansing of the heavenly sanctuary, when all who accept Jesus as their
Saviour will have their sins blotted out, and their names retained in
the book of life. (See Hebrews 8 and 9.)
    9. When did this investigative judgment, or cleansing of the heav-
enly sanctuary, begin? Dan. 8:13, 14.
    NOTE.—"The 2300 days had been found to begin when the com-
mandment of Artaxerxes for the restoration and building of Jerusalem
went into effect, in the autumn of B. C. 457. Taking this as the start-
ing point, there was perfect harmony in the application of all the
events foretold in the explanation of that period in Daniel 9:25-27.
Sixty-nine weeks, the first 483 of the 2300 years, were to reach to the
Messiah, the Anointed One; and Christ's baptism and anointing by
the Holy Spirit, A. D. 27, exactly fulfilled the specification. In the
midst of the seventieth week, Messiah was to be cut off. Three and a
half years after His baptism, Christ was crucified, in the spring of
A. D. 31. The seventy weeks, or 490 years, were to pertain especially
to the Jews. At the expiration of this period, the nation sealed its
rejection of Christ by the persecution of His disciples, and the apostles
turned to the Gentiles, A. D. 34. The first 490 years of the 2300 having
then ended, 1810 years would remain. From A. D. 34, 1810 years ex-
tend to 1844."—"The Great Controversy," p. 410. This date, 1844,
                                  [ 29]
marks the beginning of the investigative judgment, and since that time
the message of Revelation 14:6, 7 has been proclaimed.
                  THE SCENE OF THE JUDGMENT
    10. What view of the judgment scene was given to Daniel? Dan.
7:9, 10.
    11. Why is it appropriate that God, who presides in the judgment,
should be called "the Ancient of days"? Ps. 90:1, 2.
    NOTE.—As God is the Creator of all, it is His prerogative to preside
in this judgment. He alone can decide in what measure the believer
has appropriated the sacrifice of love made on Calvary, and has come
into harmony with the will of God, and should be accounted worthy of
a place with the redeemed.
    12. What will be the standard by which all will be judged? James
2:12; Eccl. 12:13, 14.
    13. What witnesses are present? Out of what will all be judged?
Dan. 7:10; Eccl. 5:6; Rev. 20:11, 12.
    NOTE.—There are books in heaven. Records are kept of the lives of
men. Besides the record books, there is "the book of life" (Rev. 3:5),
in which are entered the names of those who have given their hearts to
the Lord. There is also "a book of remembrance." Mal. 3:16. The
Scriptures teach that all these books will be used in the judgment.
   14. Upon what alone may the faithful rely for a favorable sen-
tence? Eph. 2:8, 9.
   15. What is Christ's relation to us in the investigative judgment?
Rom. 8:34; 1 John 2:1; Matt. 10:32, 33.
   16. When the investigative judgment is completed, and the subjects
of Christ's kingdom are determined, what announcement is made?
What long-desired event then takes place? Rev. 22:11, 12.
                       THE FINAL JUDGMENT
    17. Who are to be judged after the saints are taken with Jesus to
heaven? 1 Cor., 6:2, 3; 2 Peter 2:9.
    18. How is this judgment scene described? Rev. 20:4; faan„7 :94 10:
    19. What acknowledgment will finally be made by every soul? Isa.
45:23; Phil. 2:9-11.
                             A SUMMARY
    20. Study carefully each step in the series which makes up the most
portentous event in the life of every man.
    NoTE.—"There are three phases of the judgment mentioned in the
Scriptures,—the investigative judgment, preceding the second advent;
the judgment of the lost world and wicked angels by Christ and the
saints during the one thousand years following the second advent; and
the executive judgment, or punishment of the wicked at the close of
this period.
                                  1 303
    "The investigative judgment takes place in heaven before Christ
comes, in order to ascertain who are worthy to be raised in the first
resurrection, at His coming, and who among the living are to be
changed in the twinkling of an eye, at the sound of the last trump.
It is necessary for this to take place before the second advent, as there
will be no time for such a work between the coming of Christ and the
raising of the righteous dead.
     "The executive judgment on the wicked occurs after their cases
have been examined by the saints during the thousand years. Rev.
20:4, 5; 1 Cor. 6:1-3. The investigative judgment is that which is
announced to the world by the angel's message of Revelation 14:6, 7."

                               THE LESSON
                                  BAPTISM
   1. What ordinance did Jesus connect with faith in the gospel mes-
sage? Mark 16:15, 16.
   2. How had He already set an example in this matter? What rea-
ence attended His baptism? Matt. 3:13-17.
son did Jesus give for asking for baptism? What remarkable experi-
                                E 31 ]
   3. At Pentecost when the people cried out, "Men and brethren,
what shall we do?" what was Peter's reply? What promise is made to
those who repent and are baptized? Acts 2:38, 39.
   NoTE.—True repentance and genuine faith in Christ as the Saviour
should precede baptism. The gift of the Spirit is promised to those
who follow the example of Jesus.
   4. What is the meaning of the ordinance of baptism? Rom.
6:3-5, 11.
   NorE.—Baptism is a gospel ordinance commemorating the death,
burial, and resurrection of Christ. In baptism public testimony is
given to the effect that the one baptized has been crucified with Christ,
buried with Him, and is raised with Him to walk in newness of life.
Only immersion can rightly represent these experiences. This is in
harmony with the example of Christ and the practice of the primitive
church.
   5. What things should we seek after our baptism? Col. 3:1, 2.
   6. What must the baptized believer "put off"? What should be
"put on"? Verses 8, 12-14.
   NOTE.—"It [baptism] means repentance for sin, and the entrance
upon a new life in Christ Jesus. There should be no undue haste to
receive the ordinance."—"Testimonies," Vol. 6, p. 93.
   After baptism "the believer is to bear in mind that he is dedicated
to God, to Christ, and to the Holy Spirit. He is to make all worldly
considerations secondary to this new relation. Publicly he has declared
that he will no longer live in pride and self-indulgence. He is no
longer to live a careless, indifferent life. He has made a covenant with
God."—Id., pp. 98, 99.
               THE ORDINANCE OF HUMILITY
   7. How did Jesus show His love "unto the end"? John 13:1, 4, 5.
   8. What objection did Peter make? How was his objection over-
come? How complete was his surrender? Verses 8-10.
    9. What reasons are given for the observance of this ordinance?
John 13:15-17.
    NOTE.—"Jesus, the served of all, came to be the servant of all. And
because He ministered to all, He will again be served and honored by
all. And those who would partake of His divine attributes, and share
with Him the joy of seeing souls redeemed, must follow His example
of unselfish ministry.
    "All this was comprehended in the words of Jesus,       have given
you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.' This was the
intent of the service He established. And He sayi, 'If ye know these
things,' if you know the purpose of His lessons, 'happy are ye if ye do
them.' "—"The Desire of Ages," p. 651.
                    THE LORD'S SUPPER
   10. Upon what occasion was the Lord's Supper instituted? 1 Cor.
11:23.
                            [ 32 I
    11. What three things did Jesus do before giving the bread to the
disciples? Matt. 26:26.
    12. What did He say as He passed the bread to them? 1 Cor. 11:24.
    13. What was the next step in this ordinance? Verse 25.
    14. What is shown each time the Lord's Supper is eaten? Verse 26.
    15. What preparation should be made for this service? Verses
27-29.
    NoTE.—It is not the one who has a deep sense of his sinfulness and
of his unworthiness of God's mercy and grace, but he who does not
discern that Christ died for his sins—who is not penitent—that eats
and drinks unworthily.
    16. What is signified by partaking of the bread and the wine? How
is communion with one another described? 1 Cor. 10:16, 17.
    17. What effect does the Lord's Supper have upon one who partakes
of it in the proper spirit?
    Answer.—"As we receive the bread and wine symbolizing Christ's
broken body and spilled blood, we in imagination join in the scene of
communion in the upper chamber. We seem to be passing through the
garden consecrated by the agony of Him who bore the sins of the
world. We witness the struggle by which our reconciliation with God
was obtained. Christ is set forth crucified among us. . . . The thought
of Calvary awakens living and sacred emotions in our hearts. Praise
to God and the Lamb will be in our hearts and on our lips; for pride
and self-worship can not flourish in the soul that keeps fresh in memory
the scenes of Calvary."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 661.


                              LESSON 12

cuss the following:
       Why should I pay tithe?                 •
       Why should I give offerings?
    7. Review the lesson, asking questions from any of the lesson sheets. Read
the notes in the "Youth's Instructor," if the paper is at hand.
                            THE LESSON
                          GOD'S OWNERSHIP
    1. To whom do we belong? 1 Cor. 3:23; 6:19, 20.
    NoTu.—We belong to the Lord by right of creation. We have for-
feited life through sin, and Christ died to redeem us from death. So
we belong to the Lord, not only by creation, but also by redemption.
   2. How dependent are we upon God? Acts 17:24, 25.
   3. To whom belong the earth and all created things? Ps. 24:1;
50:10-12; Haggai 2:8.
   4. What part of one's income does the Lord claim as His? Lev.
27:30.
     5. What is our responsibility in the use of our possessions? Matt.
25 : 14-27.
    NoTE.—"The Lord has made us His stewards. He has placed His
means in our hands for faithful distribution. He asks us to render to
Him His own. He has reserved the tithe as His sacred portion."—
"Testimonies," Vol. 9, p. 51.
                  HISTORY OF TITHE PAYING
   6. How early in the history of the world do we read of tithe pay-
ing? To whom did Abraham pay tithe? Gen. 14:17-20.
    7. After what order was Christ made a high priest? Heb. 5:5, 6;
6:20.
    8. What vow did Jacob make at Bethel? Gen. 28:20-22.
    NOTE.—A vow or pledge to give the Lord certain things, made at
times of spiritual refreshing when the Holy Spirit moves the heart to
benevolence, God holds very sacred indeed. It can not ruthlessly be
set aside, nor later counted as a light matter, without great peril to
the soul.
   9. How did Jesus express His approval of tithe paying even in very
small items? Matt. 23:23.
                             GOD'S PLAN
    10. What is God's plan for the support of the ministry? 1 Cor.
9:13, 14.
    NOTE.—To be partakers with the altar means to live upon the gifts
that are brought into the house of God, and especially the tithe. Nuns.
18:20, 21.
   "Even so," that is,'in the same manner. As the priests and Levites
were supported by the tithes, so also the ministers of the gospel should
now be kept by the tithes that are brought into the treasury by those
who believe, and are obedient to the gospel.
                                 [34 ]
   11. Of what sin are we guilty when we withhold the tithe and free-
will offerings? How does the Lord ask us to prove Him? Mal. 3:8-10.
    NOTE.—As the tithe belongs to God, we have no right to retain it
for our own use, or for any purpose. If we do, then we rob God. "The
Lord desires His people to be thoughtful and caretaking. He desires
them to practice economy in everything. If the workers in the mission
fields could have the means that is used in expensive furnishings and
in personal adornment, the triumphs of the cross of Christ would be
greatly extended."—"Testimonies," Vol. 9, p. 54.
    12. To what time does this instruction in Malachi apply? Verses
2, 3.
    NOTE.—Malachi 3 has a distinct application to the Christian age.
A careful reading and comparison with chapter 4 will convince us that
it has special reference to the last days.
                              OFFERINGS
   13. What are we to bring when we come to the Lord's house?
Ps. 96:8.
    NOTE.—"Not all can make large offerings, not all can do great
works, magnificent deeds; but all can practice self-denial, all can reveal
the unselfishness of the Saviour. Some can bring large gifts to the
Lord's treasury; others can bring only mites; but every gift brought
in sincerity is accepted by the Lord.
    "We plead for the money that is spent on needless things. My
brethren and sisters, waste not your money in purchasing unnecessary
things. You may think these little sums do not amount to much, but
many littles will make a great whole."—"Testimonies," Vol. 9, pp.'
54, 55.
   14. With what spirit would the Lord have us give? 2 Cor. 9:7.
     NOTE.—"There are many who urge that they can not do more for
God's cause than they now do ; but they do not give according to their
ability. The Lord sometimes opens the eyes blinded by selfishness by
simply reducing their income to the amount they are willing to give.
. . . In many cases God tests man with blessings, and if unfaithfulness
is manifested in rendering to Him tithes and offerings, His blessing is
withdrawn."—"Testimonies," Vol. 4, p. 484.
   15. What did Jesus say concerning giving? Acts 20:35.
   16. By what means is man enabled to acquire wealth? Deut. 8:18.
    NOTE.—Through the spirit of prophecy is revealed an important
occasion when Satan gave counsel to his angels. Said he: "Go, make
the possessors of lands and money drunk with cares. If you can make
them place their affections upon these things, we shall have them yet.
They may profess what they please, only make them care more for
money than for the success of Christ's kingdom or the spread of the
truths we hate. Present the world before them in the most attractive
                                 [ 35 ]
light, that they may love and idolize it. We must keep in our ranks
all the means of which we can gain control. The more means the fol-
lowers of Christ devote to His service, the more will they injure our
kingdom by getting our subjects. . . .
    "Control the money matters if you can, and drive their ministers to
want and distress. This will weaken their courage and zeal. Battle
every inch of ground. Make covetousness and loize of earthly treasures
the ruling traits of their character. As long as these traits rule, salva-
tion and grace stand back. Crowd every attraction around them, and
they'will be surely ours. And not only are we sure of them, but their
hateful influence will not be exercised to lead others to heaven. When
any shall attempt to give, put within them a grudging disposition that
it may be sparingly."—"Early Writings," pp. 266, 267.
                         DANGER OF RICHES
    17. 'What is said of those who will be rich? What is the love of
money said to be? 1 Tim. 6:9, 10.
    NoTE.—One may love money even when one possesses little of it.
It is not money itself, but the love of it, that is "the root of all evil."
Money may be a great blessing when used for others and for God's
work.
   18. According to what rule should one give? Deut. 16:17.
    19. What should constrain us in all our giving? 2 Cor. 5:14, 15.

     "All that God's Word commands, we are to obey. All that it prom-
 ises, we may claim. The life which it enjoins is the life that, through
 its power, we are to live. Only as the Bible is thus held can it be
'studied effectively."—"Education," p. 189.

    "In studying the Scriptures we become acquainted with God, and
are led to understand our relation to Christ, the sin-bearer, the surety
for the fallen race."—"Counsels to Teachers," p. 429.

                    in a village of New Guinea.


APPRECIATION OF THE PICTURE ROLLS
    Sabbath schools that are sending Picture Rolls abroad have the
inspiration of a direct contact with the mission fields, which they get
in no other way. These paragraphs from a missionary in Africa show
that the Picture Rolls are being appreciated:
    "The Picture Roll is invaluable among our illiterate people in the
Protectorate. Pictures speak all languages. A stranger looking on
would see one black man standing in front of a group of black people
of all ages and conditions. He is referring to a Picture Roll. The
people's eyes are fixed interestedly upon the picture, and the teacher
is talking earnestly, quickly, energetically, in a perfectly unintelligible,
barbarous•sounding language. But he is telling the old, old story, and
the hearty murmurs of approval that follow his frequent 'Is that not
so?' show that, in very truth, those strange sounds are conveying to
the hearts of these simple people the sweet story of salvation.
    "Last year we went into a new language area for the first time.
We had no literature in that tongue, but we had the Picture Roll.
The story of the pictures is told, and the picture afterwards sold.
The owner then proudly nails the picture up on his hut, and, is glad
to tell the meaning of it to any who ask. Thus the witness is con•
tinued long after the teacher has returned to his home station.
    "Again I thank you for those kind thoughts of us which you have
for so long translated into consistent action. And may I be bold
enough to say, 'Please, keep sending them.' They have a definite
place in our program of advance."
    If your Sabbath school is one that has had an address to which
to send a Picture Roll, but has failed to send it, will you not determine
right now that hereafter your Roll shall be sent out every quarter, so
that the worker who is anxiously watching for it will not be disap-
pointed?            General Conference Sabbath School Department.
