The answer
              to the oft-repeated question, How can I
              realize greater benefits from the study of
              the Sabbath school lessons? is summed up
              in the following :

1. Daily study of the Bible.
2. Daily study of the Lesson Quarterly.
3. Daily study of the lesson help,


                           "The
                             Acts
                             of the
                            Apostles"
               The lessons for this and the next quarter
             are on the book of Acts. If you have not
             had access to the lesson help the past
             quarter, you have missed much. In other
             words, your lessons have been only half
             studied.
               "The Acts of' the Apostles" will be in-
             dispensable for the full period of the lessons
             on this subject. No thorough student will
             be without it. The book contains 63o pages,
             on Bible paper.

         THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES
                               LESSON 1
      THE MINISTRY OF SAUL AND PETER
                            January 1, 1927
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Acts 9: 23-43.
MEMORY VERSE: "He which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the
   faith which once he destroyed." Gal. 1: 23.
LESSON HELP: "The Acts of the Apostles," pp. 123-132.
                       SETTING OF THE LESSON
    Time: Probably about A. D. 40. It was apparently soon after
 Paul's visit to Jerusalem following his three years' retirement in
Arabia (Gal. 1: 17-21): During A. D. 39 and 40 Petronius, the gov-
ernor of Syria, was causing great consternation among the Jews by at-
tempting to ,set up the statue of the emperor Caligula in the temple at
Jerusalem. The Jews had thus so much to attend to themselves that it
would seem they had no time to engage in persecuting the Christians.
This pity have been the reason for the rest which the church enjoyed,
referred to in Acts 9: 31.
    Previous to this time of peace for the church, the persecution had
1pecome "so fierce that Paul was not allowed to continue his labors at
Damascus. A messenger from heaven bade him leave for a time; and
lie 'went into Arabia,' where he found a safe retreat.
    "Here, in the solitude of the desert, Paul had ample opportunity for
 quiet study and meditation. He calmly reviewed his past experience,
and made sure work of repentance. He sought God with all his heart,
 resting not until he knew for a certainty that his repentance was ac-
cepted and his sin pardoned. He longed for the assurance that Jesus
 would be with him in his coming ministry. He emptied his soul of the
 prejudices and traditions that had hitherto shaped his life, and re-
 ceived instruction from the Source of truth. Jesus communed with
 him, and established him in the faith, bestowing upon him a rich
 measure of wisdom and grace:"—"The Acts of the Apostles," pp.
125, 126.
     Afterwards Saul returned to Damascus, and attempted to continue
 his ministry as recorded in this lesson.
                       Suggestions for Daily Family Study
     1. Read the "Setting of the Lesson" and the Lesson Scripture. Drill on the
memory verse each day.
    2. Study Questions 1-3. Note how the providence of God overruled political
events to give rest and peace to the church, as shown in Lesson Note. Children
may read paragraphs 1-3 of the primary lesson. Read pages 123-125 of the Les-
son Help.
     3. Study Questions 4.8. Give careful thought to note following Question 5.
Children may read paragraphs 4-6 of the primary lesson. Read pages 126.129 of
the Lesson Help.
     4. Study Questions 9, 10, and notes. Children may review the lesson thus
far. Read page 130 of the Lesson Help.
     5. Study -Questions 11-13. Children may read paragraph 7 of -the primary
lesson.                                                                         •
                                       I3
      6. Study Questions 14, 15, and note. Children may read paragraphs 8-11 of
. the primary lesson. Read pages 131, 132 of the Lesson Help.
      7. Review the lesson, giving special thought to the main points. Ask ques-
  tions from different lessons. Discuss questions under "Personal Reflections."
                                THE LESSON
      1. When the Jews could not withstand the wisdom and power of
  Saul's preaching, what did they attempt to do? Acts 9: 23.
      NOTE.—"After that many days were fulfilled" doubtless refers to
  the three years which Paul spent in Arabia. Gal. 1: 17-21.
      The character and effect of Saul's preaching was like that of
  Stephen. Acts 6: 9-15.
      2. How persistent were the enemies of Saul in their plans for his
  destruction? Acts 9: 24.
      3. To what means did the disciples resort to rescue Saul from his
  enemies? Verse 25.
      NOTE.—"Saul had 'increased the more in strength, and confounded
  the Jews which dwelt at /Damascus, proving that this is very Christ'
  (verse 22). Now he not merely 'proclaims' as before (verse 20) ; he
  `proves.' He does it with such marvelous skill that the Jews are first
  confounded, then enraged to the point of murder. Their former hero
  was now their foe. The disciples had learned to, run from Saul. They
  now let him down in a basket through the wall by night, and he is
  gone. This then is the beginning of the active ministry of the man who
  was called to be a chosen vessel to gentiles, kings, and Jews. . . . He _
 had his message and it had his whole heart. . . . He had no need of
 light from the apostles since 'the divine revelation so completely ab-
 sorbed Isis interest and attention.' "—"Life and Teachings of Paul,"
 Garvie, p. 33.
                                                                •
      4. When Saul reached Jerusalem, how was he received by the disci-
 ples who dwelt There? Verse 26.
     .NOTE.—"They had heard of his wonderful conversion, but as be
 had immediately retired into Arabia, and they had heard nothing defi-
 nite of him further• they had not credited the rumor of his great
. change."—"Spirit o/ProphecY," Vol. 3, p. 320.
      5. How were the disciples at Jerusalem assured of the genuineness
 of Saul's conversion? Verse 27.
     NOTE.—"The apostles no longer hesitated; they could not withstand
 God. Peter and James, who at that time were the only apostles in
 Jerusalem, gave the right hand of fellowship to the once fierce perse-
 cutor of their faith ; ,and he was now as much beloved and respected as
 ]1)e had formerly been feared and avoided. Here the two grand char-
 acters of the new faith met—Peter, one of the chosen companions of
 Christ while He was upon earth, and Paul, a Pharisee, who, since the
 ascension of Jesus, had met Him face to face, and had talked with
 Him, and had also ken Him in vis,ion, and the nature of His work in
 heaven."—Id., p. 321.
     6. How was Saul's testimony received at Jerusalem? Verses 28, 29.
     7. How de.9 was the apostle's love for those who were seeking his
 life? Rom. 9: 1-3.
                                     [4]
      NOTE.—"He would willingly have yielded up his life, if by that
 means they might have been brought to a knowledge of the truth.
       . He had taken so active a part in the martyrdom of Stephen that
 he was deeply anxious to wipe out the stain by boldly vindicating the
 truth which had cost Stephen his life. It looked to him like cowardice
 to fleeifrom Jerusalem."—Id., p. 322.
      8. While braving the consequences of remaining at Jerusalem, what
 divine message came to Saul? Acts 22: 17, 18.
      9. How was Saul delivered from the plottings of the Jews at Jeru-
 salem? Acts 9: 30.
      NOTE.—"When the brethren. learned of the vision of Paul, and the
 care which God had over him, their anxiety on his behalf was in-
 creased; for they realized that he was indeed a chosen vessel of the
 Lord, to bear the truth to the gentiles. They hastened his secret es-
 cape from Jerusalem, for fear of his assassination by the Jews."—Id.,
 p. 323.                                                                  •
      10. About the time of Saul's departure from Jerusalem, what po-
 litical event was overruled for the good of the church? Verse 31_
  (See first paragraph of the "Setting of the Lesson.")
      11. Under what commission had Peter been sent out to preach?
 Luke 9: 2; 10: 9. _
      12. Where was Peter now active in labor? What case of suffering
 at Lydda attracted his attention'? Acts 9: 32, 33.
      13. How was the promised power of the gospel manifested on this
 occasion? What was the effect upon the people? Verses 34, 35.
      14. What further manifestation of power attended Peter's min-
 istry at Joppa? -Verses 36-41.
      15. How extensively did this miracle become known? What was
  its effect upon the people? As 'Peter remained there for a time, with
  whom did he stay? Verses 42, i43.
      NomE.—"Christ designs that heaven's order, heaven's plan of gov-
  ernment, heaven's divine harmony, shall be represented in His church
  on earth. Thus in His people He is glorified. Through them the Sun
,of Righteousness will shine in undimmed luster to the world. Christ
  has given to His church ample facilities, that He may receive a large
  revenue of glory from His redeemed, purchased possession. He has
  bestowed upon His people capabilities and blessings that they may
  represent His own sufficiency. The church, endowed with the right-
  eousness of Christ, is His depository, in which the riches of His mercy,
  His grace, and His love, are to appear in full and final display. Christ
  looks upon His people in their purity and perfection, as the reward
  of His humiliation, and the supplement of His glory,—Christ, the
  great Center, from whom radiates all glory."—"The Desire of Ages,"
  p. 680.
                         PERSONAL REFLECTIONS
       Would the same depth of repentanCe, and thoroughness of conse-
   cration on my part, bring me in touch with the same source of power
  as was manifested in the lives of Paul and Peter?
       What does the lesson teach as to the value of seeking periods of
  retirement from the stress of daily work, for communion with GodI

                   CORNELIUS AND PETER
                              January 8, 1927
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Acts 10: 1-23.
MEMORY VERSE: "Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial
   before God." Acts 10: 4.
LESSON HELP: "The Acts of the Apostles," pp. 132-137.
                         SETTING OF THE LESSON
   Cnsarea on the shore of the Mediterranean was about thirty miles
north of Joppa, a gentile city, and the political capital of Judea,
Joppa, now called Jaffa, is still an important town in Palestine. To
understand all the circumstances of this lesson, one must.remember the
deep-seated. feelings of the Jew against the gentile. No pious Jew
would go to the home of a gentile or enter into any social relationship
with him. One of the greatest questions the early church had to settle
was the admission of the gentiles to the privileges of the gospel.

    NOTE.—"Cornelius     appears to have been in that, class of persons
 . . . who had so far benefited by their contact with the Jewish people
as to have become convinced that theirs was the true religion. They,
consequently, worshiped the true God, were acquainted with the
scriptures of the Old Testament, and observed several Jewish customs,
as, for instance, their hours for prayer or anything else that did not
involve an act of special profession."—Id., art. "Cornelius."
   3. Under what circumstances did this good man receivea comfort-
ing message from the Lord? What was the message? Verses 3, 4.
   NomE.—Prayei forms the connection between the soul and God.

     4. To whom did the angel direct Cornelius for further light and
instruction? How explicit were the directions given? Verses 5, 6.
     NoTE.—"The angel appeared to Cornelius while he was at prayer.
. . • The explicitness of these directions, in which was named even
the occupation of the man with whom Peter was staying, shows that
heaven is acquainted with the history and business of men in every
station of life. God is familiar with the experience and work of the
humble laborer, as well as with that of the king upon his throne. . . .
     "Thus God gave evidence of His regard for the gospel ministry and
for His organized church. The angel was not commissioned to tell
Cornelius the story of the cross. A than subject, even as the centurion
himself;-to human frailties arid temptations, was to be the one to tell
him of the crucified and risen Saviour."—"The Acts of the Apokles,"
pp. 133, 134.
   5. How did Cornelius respond to this instruction of the angel?
Verses 7, 8.
     6. To what kind of man was Cornelius sent for light and instruc-
       r
 tion? Verse 9.
     NOTE.—The Lord knows in what house, on what street, and in what
'city His children live. He knows when and where they pray. (See
 Acts 9: 11.) It was to Cornelius, who "prayed 10. God alway," and to
 Peter, who "went up upon the housetop to pray," that the two visions
 recorded in this lesson were given.
     It was when Daniel prayed far into the night that the dream` of
 Nebuchadnezzar and the interpretation thereof were made known to
 him.
    7. What vision was given to Peter on this occasion? Verses 10-12.
   8. What command came to him in connection with the vision?
Verse 13.
   9. What response did Peter make to this, command? Verse 14.
   NOTE.—"Though Cornelius was a Roman, he had become acquainted
with the true God, and had renounced idolatry. He was obedient to
the will of God, and worshiped Him with a true heart. He had not
connected himself with the Jews, but was acquainted with, and obedi-
ent to, the moral law. He had not been circumcised, nor did he take
part in the sacrificial' offerings; he was therefore accounted by. the
Jews as unclean. He, however, sustained the Jewish cause by liberal
donatiOns, and was known far and near for his deeds of charity and
benevolence. His righteous life made him of good repute, among both
Jews and gentiles."—"Spirit of Prophecy," Vol. 3, pp. 324, 325.
   10. In whal words was the command to Peter thrice repeated?'
Verses 15, 16.
    11. What did Peter understand this vision to mean? Verse 28.
    NOTE.—"By the vision of the sheet, and its contents, let down from
 heaven, Peter was to be divested of his settled prejudices against the
 gentiles; to understand that, through Christ, heathen nations were
 made partakers  a  the blessings and privileges of the Jews, and were
 to be thus benefited equally with them. Some have urged that this
                                  [7 l
 vision was to signify that God had removed 'His prohibition from the
 use of the flesh of animals which He had formerly pronounced un-
 clean; and that therefore swines' flesh was fit for food. This is a very
 narrow, and altogether erroneous interpretation, and is plainly con-
 tradicted in the Scriptural account of the vision and its consequences."
 —Id., pp. 327, 328.
     12. While Peter was reflecting on the vision, what visitors were
 making inquiry for him at his gate? Verses 17; 18.
     13. What further instruction did Peter receive while still reflecting
 on the vision? Verses 19, 20.     •
     14. As Peter met the men from Casarea, what announcement did he
" make concerning himself? What question did he ask them? Verse 21.
     15. What reply did the messengers make? Verse 22.
     16. What hospitality did Peter show these visitors before going
  with them to Cesarea? Verse 23.
     17. How does this lesson show that the Lord honors prompt obe-
  dience to His commands?
                         PERSONAL REFLECTIONS
     Would acquaintance with the Lord, through prayer, bring guidance
  to me in time of need?
     How may I be hindering the carrying out of the Lord's plan?

   1. When did Peter and those who were with him arrive in Cmsarea?
What preparation had Cornelius made in view of Peter's expected ar-
rival? Acts 10: 24.
   2. How .was Peter greeted by Cornelius? Verse 25.
   NOTE.—"As Peter entered the house of the gentile, Cornelius did
not salute him as an ordinary visitor, but as one honored of heaven,
and sent to him by God, . . . Cornelius, overwhelmed with reverence
for the apostle who had been delegated by God, fell at his feet and
worshiped him."-"Spirit of Prophecy," Vol. 3, p. 329.
     3. How did Peter respond to the homage paid to him by Cornelius?
Verse 26.
     NOTE.—"Peter shrank with horror from this act of the centurion,
and lifted him to" his feet, saying, 'Stand up, I myself' also-am a man.'
. . . Had Peter been invested with the authority and position accorded
to him by the Roman CatholiC' Church, he would have encouraged,
rather than have checked, the veneration of Cornelius. The so-called
successors of Peter require kings and emperors to bow at their feet;.
but Peter himself claimed to be only an erring and fallible man."—
Id., pp. 329, 330.
     4. As Peter entered the house of Cornelius; what did he find?
Verse 27. -
     5. What statenlent and inquiry did Peter make on meeting Corne-
lius? Verse's 28, 29. s'
     6. How did Cornelius explain his reason for sending for Peter?
Verses 30-32.                                      ti             -
     NomE.--"How carefully the Lord worked to overcome the prejudice
against the gentiles that had been so firmly fixed in Peter's mind by
his Jewish training! By the vision of the sheet and its contents, He
sought to divest the apostle's mind of this prejudice, and to teach the
important truth that in heaven there is no respect of persons; that
Jew and gentile are alike precious in God's sight; that through Christ
the heathen may be made partakers of the blessings and privileges of
the gosiDel."—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 136.
    7. How did Cornelius open the way for Peter's message? Verse 33.
    8. What still clearer vision does Peter seem to have gained on this
inspiring occasion? Verse 34.
    NOTE.—"Here we may perceive the workings of God's plan to set
the machinery in motion, whereby His will may be done on earth as it
is done in heaven. Peter had not yet preached the gospel to the
gentiles. Many of them had been interested listeners to the truths
which he taught. . . . The Greek Jews had received the. labors of the
apostles, and many of them had responded to those efforts by embrac-
ing the faith of Jesus ;'but the conversion of Cornelius was to'be the
first one of importance among the gentiles."—"Spirit of Prophecy."

    14. Who before Peter had borne similar witness? Verse 43.
    15. What manifestation of divine power attended Peter's sermon,
for which the soil had been so well prepared? Verse 44,
    NOTE.—"Peter preached Jesus to that company of attentive hear-
ers; His life, ministry, miracles, betrayal, crucifixion, resurrection, and
ascension, and His work in heaven, as man's representative and advo-
cate, to plead in the sinner's behalf. As' the apostle spoke, his heart
glowed with the Spirit of God's truth which he was presenting to the
people. His hearers were charmed by the doctrine'they hevd, for their
hearts had been prepared to receive the truth. The apostle was inter-
rupted by the descent of the Holy Ghost, as was manifested on the day
of Pentecost."—Id., pp. 331, 332.
    16.. How were those whq accompanied Peter from Joppa affected?
Verses 45, 46.
    17. What question did Peter then ask? Verse 47.
    18. What did he'command those assembled to do? Verse 48.
    NOTE.—"The descent of the Holy Ghost upon the gentiles was not
an equivalent for baptism. The requisite steps'in conversion, in all
cases, are faith, repentance, and baptism. Thus the true. Christian
church are united in one Lord, One faith, one baptisni."—Id., p. 332:
                     ,PERSONAL REFLECTIONS
   The same spirit % of faith and obedience that broughta shower of
the "former rain" upon the first gentile converts, will now bring
similar manifestations of the outpouring of the "latter rain." Am I
prepared to receive it?
   "God is no respecter of persons." Should I be?

                      SETTING OF THE LESSON
   A stir among the believers in Judea. Strange reports had reached
their ears concerning the conduct of Peter. They had heard that
                               [
Peter had actually been preaching the gospel. to gentiles. The preju-
dice of the Jewish believers against the idea of gentile acceptance of
the gospel led to the rehearsal of the experiences of Peter in detail,
when he returned to Jerusalem/
    The center of activity in spreading the gospel shifts in this lesson
f;om Jerusalem to Antioch, capital of Syria. It was an important city
commercially, "the common mart where East and West met," sixteen
miles from the Mediterranean Sea, and three hundred north of Jeru-
salem.

                                 THE LESSON
    1. What news reached the ears of the apostles and brethren in
Judea? Acts 11: 1.
    2. When Peter arrived at Jerusalem, how was he received by the
bTethren? Verses 2, 3.
    NomE.—"When the brethren in Judea heard that Peter had
preached to the gentiles, and had met with them, and eaten with them
in their houses, they were surprised and offended by such strange
movements on his part. They feared that such a course, which looked
presumptuous to them, would tend to contradict his own teachings. As
soon as Peter visited them, they met him with severe censure, saying,
`Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them.' "—
"Spirit of Prophecy," Vol. 3, pp. 332, 333.
    3. How did Peter reply to their contention? Verse 4.
    4. What was the substance of Peter's report to the brethren at

    8. What great truth now, for the first time, dawned upon their
minds? Verse 18.
    NomE.—"The disciples, upon hearing this account, were silenced,
and convinced that Peter's course was in direct fulfillment of the plan
                                [ 11 ]
of God, and that their, old prejudices and exclusiveness were to be
utterly destroyed by the gospel of Christ."—Id., pp. 333, 334.
    9. In the first gospel commission, ,where were the apostles com-
manded to go? Where were they not to go? Matt. 10: 5, 6.
    NOTE.—In Daniel's prophecy (Dan. 9: 24), 490 years of the great
prophetic period were allotted to the Jews. This period, beginning
in the autumn of B. C. 457, must terminate in the autumn of A. D. 34.
The gospel call was therefore limited to the Jews until that date.
Paul and Barnabas, speaking to the Jews, said (Acts 13: 46) : "It
was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to
you; but seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of
everlasting life, lo, we turn to the gentiles." In that very year, A. D.
34,. was the great persecution in which Stephen, the first Christian
martyr, was put to death.

-Persecution, the gospel message spread rapidly through the regions ly-
ing beyond the limits of Palestine; and many small companies of be-
 lievers were formed in important centers. Sgme of the disciples
`traveled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the
 Word.' Theif labors were usually confined to the Hebrew and Greek
Jews, large colonies of whom were at this time to be found in nearly
all the cities of the world."—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 155.

in these newly opened centers of light? Verse, 22.
   14. How did Barnabas exhort the new converts? Verse 23.
   15. What character does Inspiration ascribe to Barnabas?
Verse 24.
   16. Whom did Barnabas seek as a colaborer? Verse 25.
   NoTE.—Barnabas now hastened to find Saul and brought him to
Antioch, at which place their united labors in the gospel began. "The
labors of Barnabas in Antioch were richly blessed, and many were
added to the number of believers there. As the work developed,
Barnabas felt the need of suitable help, in order to advance in the
opening providences of God; and he went to Tarsus to seek for Paul,
who, after his departure from Jerusalem some time before, had been
laboring in 'the regions of Syria and Cilicia,' proclaiming 'the faith
which once he destroyed.' Barnabas was successful in tiding Paul,
and in persuading him to return with him as a companion in ministry."
—Id., p. 156.
    17. At what place was the name Christian first bestowed upon the
followers of Christ? Verse 26.
   18. Who• next came to Antioch from Jerusalem? Verse 27.

   Time: Spring of A. D. 44. The Passover that yeas' was April 1-8.
The martyrdom of James took place just before the feast, and the
release of Peter just after. For a time the churches in Judea had en-
joyed rest from persecution (Acts 9: 31)!► After a time, the Jews
again turned toward the rapidly increasing Christian church, and used
their influence with Herod the king to stop its progress by persecution.
The famine predicted by the prophets at Antioch was on the increase.
Barnabas and Saul came to Jerusalem, bearing the relief that had been
provided by the church at Antioch..

                                  THE LESSON
   1. After a period of rest from persecution, what trying experience
came to the church at Jerusalem? Acts 12: 1.
   NOTE.—The accuracy of the sacred writer in the expression "about
that time" is remarkable. "There was no portion of time for thirty
                                        [ 13 ]
 years before, or ever afterwards, in which there was a king at Jerusa-
 lem, a person exercising that authority in Judea, or to whom that title
 could be applied, except the last three years of Herod's life, within
 which period the transaction here recorded took place."—Paley.
     2. What Christian believer became the first victim of the rage of
 the tyrant Herod? Verse 2.
     NoTE.—James, the brother of John, had been a prominent apostle.
 He was one of the earliest disciples, one of the favored three admitted
 to the death chamber of Jairus' daughter (Mark 5: 37), to the Mount
 of Transfiguration (Matt. 17: 1), and to the agony 'in the garden
  (Matt. 26: 37). Jesus had said to him, "Ye shall drink indeed of My
 cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with :-but
 to sit on My right hand, and on My left, is not Mine to give, but it
 shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of My Father." Matt.
20: 23. In these prophetic words the Lord foretold the death of
 James.
     3. What seems to have been the chief motive prompting Herod in
 this cruel persecution? Verse 3.
     NoTE.—Several Herods are mentioned during      he  seventy years of
 New Testament history.
     (a) Herod the Great, the founder of the family, was the murderer
 of the children at BethleheM; he died in the spring, after the birth of -
 Christ, B. C. 4.
     (b) Herod Antipas, his son (B. C. 4 to A. D. 39), was the Herod
 who murdered John the Baptist.
     (c) Herod Agrippa I, grandson of Herod the Great, was the king
 who murdered the apostle James, as recorded in this lesson (A. D.
37-44).
     (d) Herod Agrippa II, great grandson of Herod the Great, was the
 Herod before,whom Paul made his defense (Acts 26: 28).
    4. What did Herod purpose concerning Peter? Verse 4.
    NoTE.—The word that is translated "Passover" in the Revised
 Version, is mistranslathd "Easter" in the King James Version. The
 death of James occurred just before the eight-day period of_the Pass-
 over, and the deliverance of Peter followed at its close.
    5. While Peter was in prison, how was he remembered by the
"church at Jerusalem? Verse 5.
    6. How long was the answer to their prayers deferred? What oc-
curred the night before the date set for the execution of_ Peter?
Verses 6, 7.
    NOTE.—"It is the last night before the proposed execution. A
mighty angel is sent from heaven to rescue Peter. The strong gates
that shut in the saint of God open without the aid of human hands.
The angel of the Most High passes through, and the gates close noise-
lessly behind him. He enters the cell, and there lies Peter, sleeping
the peaceful sleep of perfect trust."—"The Acts of ,the Apostles,"
p. 146.
    7. What command did Peter receive from his heavenly visitor that
showed care for his comfort? Verse 8.
                                  [ 14 ]
    8. How did this sudden awakening out of sleep and that which
followed impress Peter? Verse 9.
   9. How far did the angel accompany, Peter? Verse 10.
   10. Of what was Peter conscious when he came to himself?
Verse 11.
   11. When Peter came to realize fully what had taken place, where
did he go? Verse 12:
   NoTE.=—Many were gathered together praying. It was now almost
morning, between three and six o'clock. As .this was the last night
before Peter's expected execution, they continued all night in prayer.
   12. How did the assembled disciples respond to Peter's knock at
the gate? Verses 13-15.
    13. How did the disciples feel when they recognized Peter?
Verse 16.
    NOTE.—"It was impossible for them to know what answer was
wisest and best. God had allowed Stephen to be stoned, and his
martyrdom had spread the gospel as a great wind spreads a conflagra-
tion. How did they know it was not God's will for Peter to be a
martyr that should light up the heathen skies with the gospel, even
more than his life could do? They prayed for Peter because they
loved him, and because he seemed necessary for the good of Christ's
cause; but the soul of their prayer was for the cause of Christ and the
salvation of men. They knew this prayer would be answered. Even
if Peter was to be released, they could not imagine in which, of a
hundred possible ways, it would be done. They, evidently never
dreamed of the plan God actually used. No wonder they were aston-
ished. Our astonishment at the way and the time does not deny our
expectation of an answer."—"Notes on International Sunday School
Lessons."

known? Verse 17.
   15. What question agitated the soldiers in the prison as daylight..
appeared? Verse 18.
    16. Upon whom did Herod vent his rage, on learning that Peter
had escaped? Verse 19.
    NOTE.—"Herod knew that 'no human power had rescued Peter, but
he was determined not to acknowledge that a divine power had frus-
trated his design, and he set himself in bold defiance against God."—
"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 149.
   17. How was a quarrel settled between Herod and the people of
Tyre and Sidon? Verse 20.
   18. What took place upon a special day? What fearful judgment
was instantly visited upon Herod? Verses 21-23.
   NoTE.—"Suddenly a terrible change came upon hirh. His face be-
came pallid as death, and distorted with agony. Great drops of sweat
started from his pores. He stood for a moment as if transfixed with
pain and terror ; then turning his blanched and livid face to his horror-

stricken friends, he cried in hollow, despairing tones, He whom you
have exalted as a god is stricken with death."—Id., p. 151.
    19. How was the work of the gospel affected by the persecution at
the hand of Herod? What mission had been fulfilled by Bamabas and
Saul during the time of the' events recorded in this lesson? Verses
24, 25.
    NomE.—Barnabas and Saul had come to Jerusalem to bring the re-
lief provided by the church at Antioch, in response to the warning of
the prophets. The famine was on the increase, it having begun in A. D.
43, and continued till A. D. 45.
                        PERSONAL REFLECTIONS
   In time of need, the Christian's power is in prayer, which moves the
hand that moves the world.
   The church should pray for its leaders.

                       SETTING OF THE LESSON
    When Saul was converted, the Lord said, "He is a chosen vessel
unto Me, to bear My name before the gentiles, and kings, and the
children of-Israel." Saul waited, working as he bad opportunity until.
the Lord Himself opened the way for a larger work.
    Paul labored with Barnabas in Antioch for a period of one year
after his many years' retirement in Arabia. By command of the Holy
Spirit, he and Barnabas were set apart for their mission to the gen-
tiles. They started on their first missionary journey in the autumn of
A. D. 46. This first missionary voyage seems to have occupied be-
tween one and two years, and they traveled about one thousand miles.

Verses 3, 4.
   NOTE.— Trace the journey, starting at Antioch in Syria, passing
overland, or down the Orontes River by boat, to Seleucia, sixteen miles
away.
   Thence the route is by boat southwestward to the island of Cyprus
about eighty miles out in the Mediterranean Sea. They landed at
Salamis in the east end of the island, and then worked across, a dis-
tance of about one hundred and ten miles to Paphos, the capital, on the
western coast.
   Paul and his company then took passage for Perga in Pamphylia,
the province which extended along the central part of the southern
coast now known as Asia Minor. Perga was several miles from the
coast, on the river Cestrus, which was then navigable.
   From Perga the route was north a hundred miles and more, crossing
the Taurus Mountains to Antioch in Pisidia on the high tableland.
   Driven from Antioch, the missionaries traveled about ninety miles
southeastward to Iconium.

truth ; and the Lord, in righteous anger, caused his natural eyes to be
closed, shutting out from him the light of. day. This blindness was not
permanent, but only for- a season, that he might be warned to repent,
and seek pardon of the God whom he had so grievously offended. The
confusion into which he was thus brought, made of no effect his subtle
arts against the doctrine of Christ."—"The Acts of the Apostles,"
p. 168.

whole-heartedly to the Lord's work. Unused to hardships, he was
disheartened by the perils and privations of the way. He. had labored
with success under favorable circumstances; but now, amidst the op-
position and perils that so often beset the pioneer worker, he failed to
endure hardness as a good soldier of the cross. He had yet to learn to
face danger and persecution and adversity with a brave heart. As the
apostles advanced, and still greater difficulties were apprehended, Mark
was intimidated, and losing all courage, refused to go farther, and re-
turned to Jerusalem."—Id., pp. 169, 170.

discourse? Verses 16-19.
   NOTE.—"Paul, in a Jewish synagogue, and speaking to Jews sand
those who had joined with them, wisely conciliated them and warded off
prejudice by referring to the early history of the Jews. He believed
their Scriptures, in no case overthrowing them, but simply showing
how they were fulfilled. He reminded them of the unbelief of their
ancestors, in order to prepare the audience for the startling charge he'
had to bring against the rulers of the Jews at Jerusalem, as having
condemned and slain the Saviour. He spoke of Bing David because the
promise was that the Messiah should be his descendant (Isa. 11: 1).
They were looking for the Messiah. He thus appealed to the hope dear
to the heart of every Jew. He then told them that Jesus was that
promised son of David."—"Notes on International Sunday School
Lessons."
    10. How did Paul refer to the four hundred and fifty years follow-
ing the forty years' wandering in the wilderness? Verse 20.
    11. What events did he note from the time of the judges to the
birth of the Messiah? Verse 21-25.
   12. What personal application of the truth did he then make to his
hearers? Who did he say fulfilled the prophecies that were then being
read every Sabbath day in the synagogues? Verses 26, 27. •

them? Verses 28-31.

and Barnabas next labor? Acts 14: 1.
    2. In what way did opposition develop at-Iconium? How did they
meet this opposition?• Verses 2, 3.
    NOTE.—"This increasing popularity of the doctrine of Christ
stirred the unbelieving Jews to fresh opposition. .      . They went to
the authorities, and represented their work in the most false and ex-
aggerated light, leading the officers to fear that the entire city was in
                                      I 20 I
    danger of being incited to insurrection. They stated that great num-
    bers were attaching themselves to the apostles, and suggested that it
    was for secret and dangerous designs.
       "In consequence of these charges, the disciples were repeatedly
    brought before the authorities; but it every case they so ably de-
    fended themselves before the people, that, although the magistrates
    were prejudiced against them by the false -statements they had heard,
    they dared not condemn them. They could but acknowledge that the
    teachings of the apostles were calculated to make men virtuous, law-
    abiding citizens."—"Spirit of Prophecy," Vol. 3, pp. 358, 359.
-       3. 'What was the effect upon the people of the city? To what
    height did the persecution reach? To what cities did the apostles then
    flee? Verses 4-7.        •
        NOTE.—"Friends, of the apostles, although unbelievers, warned
    them of the designs of the malicious Jews, and urged them not use-
    lessly to expose themselves to their fury, but to escape for their lives.
    They accordingly departed from Iconium in secret, and left the
    faithful and opposing parties to battle for themselves, trusting God to
    give victory to the doctrine of Christ. But they by no means took a
    final leave of Iconium.; they purposed to return, after the excitement
    then raging had abated, and complete the work they had begun."—
    Id., p. 360.
        4. 'What instruction of the Master were the apostles following in
    fleeing from Iconium? Matt. 10:.23.

        5. What eager listener sat among the hearers at Lystra? Acts
    14: 8.
        NOTE.—"As Paul recounted the works of Christ in healing the .
    afflicted, he perceived a cripple whose eyes were fastened upon him,
    and ,who received and believed his words. Paul's heart went out in
    sympathy toward the afflicted man, whose faith he discerned; and he
    eagerly grasped the hope that he might be healed by that Saviour,
    who, although He had ascended to heaven, was still man's Friend and
    Physician, having more power even than when He was upon earth."
    —Id., p. 362.
        6. What did Paul perceive concerning this poor cripple? What
    command given by the apostle did this man obey? Verses 9, 10.
        NOTE.—"In the presence of that idolatrous assembly, Paul com-
    manded the cripple to stand upright upon his feet. Hitherto he had
    only been able to take a sitting posture; but he now grasped with
    faith the words of Paul, and instantly obeyed his command, and stood
    on his feet for the first time in his life. Strength came with this
    effort -of faith; and lie who had been a cripple walked and leaped as
    though he had never experienced an infirmity."--Ibid.
       7. Beholding this miracle, what did the people say? What names
    did they ascribe to Paul and Barnabas? Verses i1, 12.
       8. How did the priest of Jupiter think to honor the visitors to
    their city? Verse 13.
       NOTE.—"The news of the miraculous cure of the cripple was soon
    noised throughout all that region, until a general excitement was
                                   [ 21 ]
aroused, and priests from the temple of the gods prepared to do the
apostles honor, as visitants from the courts of heaven, to sacrifice
beasts to them, and to bring offerings of garlands and precious things.
The apostles had sought retirement and rest in a private dwelling,
when their attention was attracted by the sound of music, and the en-
thusiastic shouting of a vast assembly, who had come to the gate of
the house where they were abiding."—Id., p. 363.
   9. What hindered the carrying out of this plan? What did Paul
say of himself and his associate? How did the apostles make this an
occasion to preach to them the only true and living God? Verses 14, 15.
   10. What had God allowed all nations to do? What witness of His
love had He constantly given? Verses 16-18. •
   11. How was 'public opinion quickly turned against the apostles?
To what extent was this persecution carried? Verse 19.
   NOTE.—"The Lystrians rushed upon the apostles with great rage
and fury. They hurled stones violently; and Paul, bruised, battered,
and fainting, felt that his eld had come. The martyrdom of Stephen
was brought vividly to his mind, and the cruel part•he had acted on
that occasion. He fell to the ground apparently dead, and the infuri-
ated mob dragged his insensible body through the gates of the city,
and threw it beneath the walls."—Id., p. 366.
   12. What took place as the believers stood around, the body of
Paul? Where did he and Barnabas go the next day? Verse 20.
   NOTE.—"To the believers this unexpected restoration of God's
servant was regarded as a miracle of divine power, and seemed to set
the signet of Heaven upon their change of belief. They rejoiced with
inexpre,ssible gladness, and praised God with renewed faith."—"The
Acts of the Apostles," p. 184.
   13. Did the apostles avoid those cities where they had suffered
persecution before? Verses 21, 22.
    14. How did they bind off the work they had formerly done?
Verse 23.
    NOTE.—"As an important factor in the spiritual growth of the new
converts, the apostles were careful to surround them with the safe-
guards of gospel order. Churches were duly organized in all places in
Lycaonia and Pisidia where there' were believers.• Officers were ap-
pointed in each church, and proper order and system was established
for the conduct of all the affairs pertaining to the spiritual welfare of
the believers.
    "This was in harmony with the gospel plan of uniting in one body
all believers in Christ, and this plan Paul was careful to follow
throughout his ministry. Those who in any place were by his labor
led to accept Christ as the Saviour, were, at the proper time, organized
into a church. Even when the believers were but few in number, this
was done."—Id., pp. 185, 186.
   15. In what other place did they preach, on their return journey?
Verses 24, 25.

sionary tour, during which time the apostles had traveled considerably
more than one thousand miles.
   17. To whom did they report their missionary work and expe-
riences? Verse 27.
    18. How much time did they spend at Antioch? Verse 28.
    NOTE.—They returned to'Antioch some time during A. D. 47, and
remained there till the Jerusalem council which was held'in A. D. 51
or 52.
                      PERSONAL REFLECTIONS
   If I have• "like passions" with Paul (Acts 14: 15), and Elijah
(James 5: 17), and Peter (Acts 10: 26), may I not also prevail with
God?

     Time: Probably A. D. 51 or 52, fourteen years after Paul's con-
version (Gal. 2: 1).
     Place: Jerusalem. The visitors were coming from Antioch in
Syria, three hundred miles north of Jerusalem.
     Paul: Age about forty-eight, now the leading apostle to the gen-
tiles. This was his third visit to Jerusalem since his conversion. The
first was A. D. 39 (Acts 9: 26), the, second A. D. 44 (Acts 11: 30).
     Circumstances: Paul and Barnabas, after an absence of nearly two
years on their mission through Asia Minor, had returned to Antioch in
Syria, and had reported to a great missionary meeting of the church
which had sent them forth. Here they remained a "long time with
the disciples" (Acts 14: 28). It was during this time that the dispute
arose with which to-day's lesson has to do.

                               THE LESSON
      1. 'What erroneous teaching caused trouble in the church at An-
  tioch? Acts 15: 1.
      NOTE.—"While the apostles united with the ministers and lay
  members at'Antioch in an earnest effort to win many souls to Christ,
  certain Jewish believers from Judea, 'of the sect of the Pharisees,' •
"-succeeded in introducing a question that soon led to widespread con-
  troversy in the church, and brought consternation to the believing
  gentiles. With great assurance these Judaizing teachers asserted that
  in order to be saved, one must be circumcised, and niust keep the entire
  ceremonial law."—"The Acts of the Apostles," pp. 188, 189.
      ,2. How did they decide to have the question settled? Verse 2.
                  the' church at Antioch, the consideration) of the ques-
  \--- NorE.—"In
 tron of circumcision resulted in much discussion and contention.
 Finally, the members of the church, fearing that a division among
 them would be the outcome of continued discussion, decided to send
 Paul and Barnabas, with some responsible men from the church, to
 Jerusalem, to lay the matter before the apostles and elders.) There
 they were to meet delegates from the different churcheS, andfhose who
 had come to Jerusalem to attend the approaching festivals. Mean-
 while all controversy was to cease until a final decision should be
 given in general council. This decision was then to be universally ac-
 cepted by the different churches throughout the country.":—Id., p. 190.
    3. On reaching Jerusalem, what report did they make to the
 church? Verse 4.
     4. At the Jerusalem council, what reference did-Peter make to his
 vision of eleven years before (Acts•10: 9-14)? Verses 7-9.
                                                               •
     5. With what question did Peter close his speech? Verses 10, 11.
     6. What testimony was borne by Barnabas and Paul? Verse 12.
      7. What line of argument was followed by James? Verses 13, 14.
      NOTE.—"James presided at the council, and his final decision was,
 `Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from
 among the gentiles are turned to God.'
      "This ended the discussion. In this instance we have a refutation
  of the doctrine held by the Roman Catholic Church,—that Peter was
  the head of the church. Those who, as popes, have claimed to be his
  successors, have no Scriptural foundation for their pretensions. Noth-
  ing in the life of Peter gives sanction to the claim that he was elevated
 _above his brethren as the vicegerent of the Most High. If those who
  are declared to be the successors of, Peter, had followed his example,

brethren assembled at Antioch? Verses 30-32.
    NOTE.--"The entire body ,of Christians were not called'to vote
upon the question. The apostles and elders—men of influence and
judgment—framed and issued the decree, which was thereUpon gen-
erally accepted by the Christian churches. All were not pleased, how-
ever, with this decision; there was a faction of false brethren who
assumed to engage in a work on their own responsibility. They in-
dulged in murmuring and faultfinding,- proposing new plans, and
seeking to pull down the work of the experienced men whom God had
ordained to teach the doctrine of Christ. The church has had such
obstacles to meet from the first, and will ever have them to the close of
time."—"Spirit of Prophecy," Vol. 3, p. 376.

    NOTE.—"Timothy or Timotheus, in the Bible (Acts 16: 1; 17: 4,
etc.), a Lycaonian, the son of a gentile father and a Jewish mother,
Eunice (2 Tim. 1: 5), was born in Lystra, and was already a member
of the Christian church there at the time of Paul's second visit. He-
took the place formerly, occupied by John Mark in Paul's company,
and in deference to Jewish feeling was circumcised. He accompanied
the apostle on many of his journeys, and was employed by him on im-
                                [ 26 ]
portant missions (1 Thess. 3 :•2; 1 Cor. 4: 17; 16: 10). Paul speaks
of him as his 'son,' and this (see Phil. 2: 22) refers to loyal service
rather than to spiritual parentage. He was especially interested in
the Macedonian churches, which he helped to foundff His name is
associated with that of Paul in the opening salutations of both epistles
to the Thessalonians, the second epistle to the Corinthians, and tho-se to
the Philippians, and Colossians. He was, therefore, with Paul at
Rome. At a later date he is mentioned in Hebrews 13: 23 as having
undergone imprisonment, but as having been released."—The Encyclo-

    It is important for me to be loyal to God, and to His organized
work in the earth, by being found on the right side of every contro-
versy that may arise.
    Do I regard salvation as a free gift, or must I do something to
earn it?

   Paul and his company came to Philippi in response to • the vision
given him in which he saw a man of Macedonia praying for him to
come over and help. Philippi was one of the chief cities in Macedonia,
and the first city in Europe where Paul preached. To the church at
Philippi, Paul later wrote the most cheering of all his epistles, calling
them "my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown."

                                    THE LESSON
    1. In what city in Macedonia did Paul and his company begin
their work? How did the apostles spend the Sabbath? Acts 16: 12, 13.
    2. Who is mentioned as accepting the message of salvation as-the
result of Paul's preaching on the Sabbath? Verse. 14.
    3. What hospitality did she extend to the apostles? . Verse 15.
    4. How did the enemy seek to hinder the work at Philippi? How
did Paul rebuke the evil spirit which sought to throw discredit upon
his mission? What was the result? Verses 16-18.
    5. What complaint did the owners of the slave girl make against
Paul and Silas? Verses 19-21.
    NorE.—"The first heathen persecution, like that subsequently at
Ephesus (Acts 19: 25-27), was set on foot by covetousness. (Compare
1 Tim. 6: 9, 10). Like the Gergesenes (Matt. 8: 28-34), they cared
nothing that a soul had been saved in comparison with the loss of
their gains."--Abbott.
    6— How was the multitude affected by these thirigs? How did the
magistrates show their displeasure? What command was given?
Verse 22.
    NoTE.—"Stirred by a frenzy of excitement, the multitude rose
against the disciples. A mob spirit prevailed, and was sanctioned by
the authorities,' who tore the outer garments from the apostles, and
commanded that they should be scourged."—"The Acts of the
Apostles," p. 213.
    7. How severely were the apostles beaten? What was then done
with them? How were they made very secure? Verses 23, 24.
    NOTE.—"The apostles suffered extreme torture because of the
painful position in which they were left, but they did not murmur.
Instead, in the utter darkness and desolation of the dungeon, they en-
couraged each other by words of prayer, and sang praises to God be-
cause they were found worthy to suffer shame for• His sake. Their
hearts were cheered by a deep and earnest love for the cause of their
Redeemer. Paul thought of the persecution he bad been instrumental
in bringing upon the disciples of Christ, and he rejoiced that his eyes
had been opened to see, and his heart to feel, the power of the glorious
truths which once he despised."—Id., pp. 213, 214.
    8. What unusual sound awakened the prisoners at midnight?
Verse 25.
    No'rE.—The Christian's inward experience of joy is superior to the
outward experience of trouble; his prayer, even in his greatest ex-
tremity, should ever be mingled with praise (Phil. 4: 6; Col. 4: 2;
1 Thess. 5: 18).
    "The prisoners heard them." "It may be that bars in the inner
walls allowed the sound to pass into other cells. The verb is not the
                                    [ 281
common one for 'hearing' and is rarely found anywhere. It indicates
attentive hearkening."—Cambridge Bible.
   9. What was the response to the midnight prayer and praise serv-
ice? Verse 26.
   NOTE.—"What these missionaries prayed for we do not know. It
may have been for release from suffering, as was right; but we have
no doubt their most earnest prayer was that God would make His cause
more successful through their sufferings, that the infant church might
be strengthened, and many be converted from' their sins. How the
answer,would come they could not know, nor did it much matter.
Answers to prayer very often come in the most unexpected ways."—
Peloubet.
   10. What did the jailer see as he awoke? What was he about to
do? Verse 27.
   NOTE.—He no doubt did not hear the songs, but was awakened by
the earthquake. "He probably slept in such a place that on rising he
could observe at a glance whether the prison doors were secure. Paul,
out of the dark, could observe him before the jailer could see farther
than the open doors."—Cambridge Bible.                     .•
   "The Roman law transferred to the jailer the punishment due an
escaped prisoner."—Riddle.
    11. How was the jailer prevented from carrying out his rash in-
tention? Verse 28.
    NOTE.—"In the bitterness of his spirit he felt that.it was better
for him to die by his own hand than to submit to a disgraceful execu-
tion. Drawing his sword, he was about to kill himself, when Paul's
voice was• beard in the words of cheer, 'Do thyself no harm: for we are
all here.' (Every man was in his place, restrained by the power of God
exerted throuoth one fellow prisoner."—"The Acts of the Apostles,'f
pp. 215, 216.
   12. What did the jailer hastily do? What anxious inquiry did he
make? Verses 29, 30.
   13. By what words•was the jailer's mind directed to the Saviour?
What effect did Paul's preaching have upon the jailer and his house-
hold? Verses 31-34.
   14. What instruction did the magistrates give to the sergeants the
next morning? When this message was givefi to Paul, what reply did
he make? Verses 35-37.
   NOTE.—"The apostles were Roman citizens, and it was unlawful to
scourge a Roman save for the most flagrant crime, or to deprive him
of his liberty without a fair trial. Paul and Silas had been publicly
imprisoned, and they now refused to be privately released without the
proper explanation on the part of the magistrates."—Id., p. 217.
    15. What caused the magistrates to fear when Paul's reply was
delivered to them? What did they do? Verses 38, 39.
    NOTE.—"When this word was brought to the authorities, they were
alarmed for fear that the apostles would complain to the emperor; and
going at once to the prison, they apologized to Paul and Silas for the
                                  [29 ]
injustice and cruelty done them, and personally conducted them out of
the prison, entreating them to depart from the city."—Id., pp. 217, 218.
    16. What was the nature of their parting meeting with the breth-
ren at the house of Lydia? Verse 40.
    17. Whit enabled Paul and Silas to speak words of comfort to the
believers in the home of Lydia? 2 Cor. 1: 3-5.
                       PERSONAL REFLECTIONS
   Have I   that personal acquaintance with the Lord, and such an
abiding trust in Him as would give me the same quiet mastery of any
situation that might arise, as characterized the experiences of Paul
and Silas?
    Am I learning to rejoice in the Lord under unfavorable circum-
stances'?
    What will enable me to give comfort to those in affliction'?

                       SETTING OF THE LESSON
    After Paul's release from the Philippian jail, in company with
Silas and Timothy, he went along the great Roman road thirty-three
miles to Amphipolis, near the seashore. Apollonia was.thirty miles
farther. Thessalonica was then thirty-seven miles distant, making a
journey of about one hundred miles in a southwest direction. Thessa-
lonica was the chief city of Macedonia in Paul's day. It is now called
Salonika, a city of considerable size. Here Paul preached for several
weeks, when a disturbance arose which compelled the missionaries to
move on, but they left a goodly number of converts to Christianity.
    Driven from Thessalonica, Paul went sixty miles farther to the
southwest on the way tct Greece, to a city called Berea. Here many
Jews and Greeks, and especially many honorable women, as in Thessa-
lonica, became disciples.

                               THE LESSON

    1. What important city did Paul and Silas next visit? Acts 17: 1.
    NorE.—"After being thus 'shamefully treated' in Philippi (1 Thess.
2: 2), Paul passed on rapidly to Thessalonica, the real capital of the
province and an admirable center of influence (cf. 1 Thess. 1: 8). In
this great seaport there was at least one synagogue; and for three
weeks he there discussed from the Scriptures the cardinal points in his
message (cf. 1 Cor. 15: 3 seq.), 'that it behooved the Christ to suffer
and to rise again from the dead,' and that accordingly 'this Jesus . . .
is the Christ' (17: 2 seq.). Some Jews believed, 'and of the God-
fearing Greeks' (semi-proselytes) a large number, including not a few
of the leading women. There was also successful work among those
who turned directly 'from idols, to serve a God living and real'
(1 Thess. 1:9)."—The Encyclopedia Britannica, 11th edition, art.
"Paul."
    2. What custom did Paul follow on the Sabbath? Verse 2.
    NOTE.—Paul kept the seventh day as the Sabbath. Note his care-
ful observance of that day as recorded in Acts 17: 2; 18: 4, and his
teaching of- the doctrine of the second coming of Christ in 1 Thessa-
lonians 4: 16.
    3. What was the theme of Paul's preaching at Thessalonica?
Verse 3.
    NOTE.—"Paul made the prophecies in the Old Testament relating to
the Messiah, and the agreement of those prophecies with the life and
teachings of Christ, clear in the minds of all among his hearers who
would accept evidence upon the subject."—"Spirit of Prophecy," Vol.
3, p. 388.
   4. What were the visible results of the effort at Thessalonica?
Verse 4.
    5. To what means did the Jews resort in stirring up an opposition
movement? Verse 5.
    NOTE.—"These Jews were not then in favor with the Ronian power,
because they had raised an insurrection in the metropolis not long
previous to this time. They were regarded with suspicion, and their
liberty was, in a measure, restricted. They now saw an opportunity to
take advantage of circumstances to reestablish themselves in favor,
and, at the same time, to throw reproach upon the apostles, and the
converts to Christianity.
    "This they set about doing by representing that the leaders in the
new doctrine were raising a tumult among the people. They accord-
ingly excited the passions of the worthless.‘mob by cunningly, devised
                                     [31 ]
  falsehoods, and' incited them to make an uproarious assault upon the
  house of Jason, the temporary home of the apostles. This they did
  with a fury more like that of wild beasts than of men."—Id., pp.
  390, 391.
      6. Not finding the apostles, whom did they involve in the commo-
  tion? Verse 6.
      NOTE.—"When they had broken into the house, however, they found
  that the apostles were not there. Friends who had apprehended what
  was about to occur, had hastened them out of the city, and they had
- departed for Berea. In their mad disappointinet at not finding Paul
  and Silas, the mob seized Jason and his brother, and dragged them
  before the authorities with the complaint."—Id., p. 391.
       7. Whaccharge was brought against the apostles? Verse 7.
       NoTE.--'-'-i`Jewish jealousy was aroused particularly by.the loss of
   their converts; and at length in alliance with the rabble of the market
   place, it was able once more to cut short the preachers' work among
   the gentiles. The charge made against them had a serious ring, since
   it involved-not only danger to public order but treason against the
' emperor,, laesa—majestas). Thus at Thessalonica Paul had experience
   of the imperial system as rival to his gospel of the sovereignty of God
   and of His Christ, the true King of humanity."—The Encyclopedia
                                    "Paul."
   Britannica, 1-1th—edititin —art;—"PauT."-
    8. How were the people and the rulers 'of the city affected?
 Verses 8, 9.
    9. Being freed from the plotting of their enemies, where did the
 apostles next go? Verse 10.
    NOTE.—"The persecuting Jews flattered themselves that by their
 course toward the Christians they had regained the confidence of the
 magistrates, and had established their reputation as loyal citizens,
 while they had, at the same time, gratified their malice toward the
 apostles, and transferred the suspicion which had heretofore rested
 upon themselves to the converts to Christianity."—"Spirit of Proph-
 ecy," Vol. 3, p. 391.
     10. Wh3t character is ascribed to the people of Berea? Verse 11.
     NoTx.--L"The minds of the Bereans were not narrowed by prejudice.
 They were willing to investigate the truthfulness of the doctrines
 preached by the apostles. . . . If, in the closing scenes of this earth's
 history, those to whom testing truths are proclaimed would follow the
 example of the Bereans, searching the Scriptures daily, and comparing
 with God's word the messages brought them, there would to-day be a
 large number loyal to 'the precepts of God's law, where now there are
 comparatively few./But when unpopular Bible truths are presented,
 many refuse toma'ke this investigation. Though unable to controvert
 the plain teachings of Scripture, they yet manifest the utmost reluc-
 tance to study the evidences offered. Sonie assume that even if these
 doctrines are indeed true, it matters little whether or not they accept
 the new light; and they cling to pleasing fables which the enemy uses
 to lead souls astray. Thus their minds are blinded by error, and they
 become separated from heaven."—"The Acts of the Apostles," pp.
231, 232.
                                   [32 ]
   11. What different classes- are mentioned as having received the
gospel at Berea? Verse 12.
   12. By whom was another strong opposition movement aroused?
Verse 13.
    NoTE.—"Paul and Silas withdrew by night, and began work in
Berea, a small city of Thessaly, in the hope of returning when excite-
ment had subsided. But Jewish intriguers from Thessalonica stirred
up the populace with the old charges, and Paul, as the prime actor,
was forced to retire, first to the coast (whence he may have thought of
a secret visit to Thessalonica, 1 Thess. 2: 18; cf. 3: 5), and then by
sea to Athens."—The Encyclopedia Britannica, 11th edition, art.
"Paul."
    13. 'What precaution was taken for Paul's safety? Verse 14.
   14. What message did Paul send back to Berea by those who had
conducted him to Athens? Verse 15.
   NOTE.—"On,arriving at Athens, the apostle sent the Berean breth-
ren back with a message to Silas and Timothy to join him immediately.
Timothy had .come to Berea prior to Paul's departure, and with Silas
had remained to carry on the work so well begun there, and to instruct
the new converts in the principles of the faith."—"The Acts of the
Apostles," p. 233.
                     PERSONAL REFLECTIONS
   Would I know more of the "sufferings of Christ," and enjoy less of
the "friendship of the world," if my life were as fully consecrated to
the service of Christ as were the lives of Paul, Silas, and Timothy?
    Do I make the Bible the standard of my belief as did the Bereans?
   Why did Paul not become discouraged by the continual persecution?

     Place: Athens, the capital of Attica, in Greece. and the great
 metropolis of literature and art for the world. It was named from
 Athena, identified with the Roman goddess Minerva, and was founded
 by Cecrops about 1556 B. C.
     "The name of Athens was synonymous with the most graceful
'conceptions of art and the profoundest study of philosophy. There
 human wisdom had sat enthroned. All succeeding generations and
 civilized nations have acknowledged her intellectual supremacy. Athens
 was the mother of the fine arts, the patron of poetry, the founder of
                                  (33 1
systems of philosophy. She gave birth to the products of genius in
almost every department of literature and art, which have scarcely, if
ever, been surpassed."—Peloubet.

                                THE LESSON
   1. What stirred the feelings of the apostle at Athens? Acts 17: 16.
    NOTE.—It is said that Athens contained over three thousand public
statues, the majority, of which were of heathen gods. In one street
there stood before every house a square pillar, upon the top of which
was a statue of the god Hermes. Every gateway and porch carried its
protecting god. A Roman poet sarcastically said, "In Athens it is
easier to find gods than men."
    2. How did Paul improve the opportunity this situation afforded
him? Verse 17.
    NOTE.—Paul began to preach to the Jews in the synagogue, and to
the people gathered in the crowded market place.
    3. By whom was he encountered as he preached "Jesus, and the
resurrection?" Verse 18.
    NOTE.—The attention even of the Epicureans and Stoics, who were
leaders in philosophy and religion in Athens, was drawn toward him
by the power of his words.
    4. Wha..,t,inf ormation did they demand of Paul? Verses 19, 20.
    NOTE.--"After discussing with them for a time', they requested
him to leave the curious and thronging crowds of the market, which
was not a proper arena for discussion; and for the convenience of
both parties, and in order to give him a fair hearing, they led him up
the steps of the Areopagus, Mars' Hill, to the platform on its summit,
where were assemblenthe noblest blood of Athens, the first politicians,
the first orators, the first philosophers; a court the most august, not
only of Athens, but of Greece, and indeed of the. whole world. It was
at thiS bar that Socrates was arraigned and condemned on the ground
of innovating upon the state religion. Here Paul was allowed to speak
`from the tribune of a regular court, where both speaker and audience
would be free from disturbance.' "—Peloubet.
    5. What characteristic of the people of. Athens is noted? Verse 21.
   6. What observation had Paul made in his walks about the city?
Verse 22.
                                     f 34 I
     7. Of what fact did he take advantage in directing their minds to
 the true God? Verse 23.
     NomE.—"The people then, as in hehthen countries pow, sacrificed to
 gods to propitiate them, and keep them from sending trouble upon
 them. 'That no deity might punish them for neglecting his worship, or
 remain uninvoked in asking for blessings, they not only erected altars
 to all the gods named or known among them; but, distrustful still lest
 they might not comprehend fully the extent of their subjection and de-
 pendence, they erected them also to any other god or power that might
 exist, although as yet unrevealed to them.' "—Peloubet.
     8. To what distinguishing power of the true God did the apostle
  appeal? Verse 24.
      NOTE.—All through the Bible the true God is set forth as the
  Creator of the heavens and the earth. (See Jer. 10: 10-12; Ps.'96: 5;
• Jer. 32: 17; 51: 15; Acts 4: 24; 14: 15).
    9: What kind of worship is -not acceptable to God? Verse 25.
    10. What great truth did Paul declare? What did he say had been
 before determined? Verse 26.
     11. What is said to be the divine_ purpose in the existence of na-
 tions? Verse 27.
     NoTE.The object of divine Providence, in His dealings with na-
 tions as well as with individuals, is to bring men to a knowledge of the
 true God.
   "The Greek word translated 'feel after' denotes the action of the
 blind person groping after what he desires to find."—Schaff.
    12. How dependent are all men upon God? Whom did Paul tact-
 fully quote as authority for his statement? Verse 28.
     NoTE.—It is a remarkable fact that with Paul's immense wealth of
 learning, and his knowledge of Greek literature and philosophy, this is
 one of but two quotations from such source to 'be found in all his
 writings. (See Titus 1: 12.)
    13. What conclusion did the apostle draw concerning idol worship?
 Verse 29.
    14. What call to repentance did he make? Verse 30.
    15. To what solemn impending event did he call attention?
 Verse 31.
    NOTE.—"The resurrection of Christ- brought assurance of the judg-
 ment of the world by Chriit, because (1) it proved Christ's claim that
 He was the Son of God. (2) It proved that His teaching was true, a
 part of which was that He should judge the world. (3) It proved the
 resurrection of the dead and a life beyond the grave, without which
 there could be no judgment."—Peloubet.
     16. How was the teaching concerning the resurrection of the dead
- received? Verse 32.
      Nora.—"It is quite probable that At this point the apostle's speech
 was stopped, before it was completed. So long as he confined himself
  to philosophy, even though it were new, they could listen, and even
                                    35 11
when he spoke of their duties; but the doctrine of the resurrection was
too strange and too personal. It was not only opposed to their teach-
ing and philosophy, but it condemned their lives. They must either
repent, or they must refuse to believe this truth. They would not re-
pent; therefore they either mocked, or put off considering the matter.
Still, there were a few believers; and Paul's sermon was not without
effect."—Ibid.
   17. What seems to have been the result of the Mars' Hill effort in
which the apostle matched "Greek with Greek"? Verses 33, 34.
    18. What lesson did the apostle evidently learn from this experi-
ence? 1 Cor. 2: 1-4.
    NoTE.—"In preaching the gospel in Corinth, the apostle followed a
course .different from that which had marked his labors at Athens.
While in the latter place, he had sought to adapt his style to the char-
acter of his audience; he had met logic with logic, science with science;
philosophy with philosophy. As he thought of the time thus spent, and
realized that his teaching in Athens had been productive of but little
fruit, he decided to follow another plan of labor in Corinth, in ,his
efforts to arrest the attention of the careless and the indifferent. He
determined to avoid elaborate arguments and discussions, and 'not to
know anything' among the Corinthians, 'save Jesus Christ, and Him
crucified.' He would preach to them 'not with enticing words of man's
wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power.' "—"The
Acts of the Apostles," p. 244.
                     PERSONAL REFLECTIONS
    All the wealth of this world's wisdom is "foolishness with God."
Its only effect, apart from Jesus Christ, in whom "are hid all the
treasures of wisdom and knowledge," is to drown men and women in
vice and corruption.
    May I possess much of the wisdom of this world, and not know the
true God?
    Is the Lord near to those who do not know Him?

                      SETTING OF THE LESSON
   Leaving Athens, Paul goes to Corinth, the capital of the Roman
province of Achaia. He most likely made tthe trip by sea. So given
over to evil was this commercial city, that "as wicked as Corinth" be-
came a proverb. /Paul remained in Corinth a year and a half. He then
                                  36
went to Ephesus, touched at Cwsarea, thence to Jerusalem, and back to
Antioch in Syria,. the place of his ordination. Thus Paul ended his
second missionary journey

                             THE LESSON
    1. After his experience at Athens, where did Paul go? Acts 18: 1.
    2. Whom did Paul meet at Corinth as associates in Christian fellow-
ship? Verse 2.
    NOTE.—"Among the Jews who had taken up -their residence in
Corinth, were Aquila and Priscilla, who afterward became distin-
guished as earnest workers for Christ. Becoming acquainted with the -
character of these persons, Paul 'abode with them.' "—"The Acts of the
Apostles," p. 243.
    3. In what secular business were Paul- and Aquila associated?
Verse 3.
    NOTE.—"Paul, after working miracles, stood in his workshop at
Corinth, and stitched hides of leather together with his hands; and the
angels regarded him with love, and the devils with fear."—St. Chrysos-
torn. Paul supported himself at Ephesus also. (See Acts 20: 34.)
    4. What custom (Acts 17: 2) did Paul follow on the Sabbath?
Verse 4.
    5. What was Paul's message to the Jews at Corinth? What
solemn declaration did Paul then make? Verses 5, 6. .
    NOTE.—"The word [opposed] implies.very strong opposition, as of
a force drawn up in battle array. It was an organized opposition."—
Cambridge Bible.
    "The more than usually violent opposition of the Jews was no
doubt stirred up by the intense earnestness of Paul in his work after
the arrival of Silas and Timotheus, when he was 'pressed and con-
strained by the Word.' "—Philip Schaff.
     6. Being no longer permitted to occupy the synagogue, where did'
 Paul continue his teaching? Verse'7.
     NOTE.—Paul departed from the synagogue (verse 4), not from the
 city or from the house of Aquila. He used the home of Justus for the
 purpose of teaching and worship. We may suppose that he still lodged
 with Aquila and Priscilla.
                                       [ 37 ]
      7. Besides many of the Corinthians, what church officer of note
  embraced the gospel? Verse 8.
      8. What comforting assurance came to Paul in a night vision?
  Verses 9, 10.
      NOTE.—"The form of the original suggests that the apostle was
  beginning to despond."—Riddle.
      "He felt keenly the trial of seeming failure and comparative isola-
  tion. His converts came chiefly from the slave or freedman class, and
  those of a culture like his own, whether Greeks or Jews, were slow to
  accept his preaching (1 Cor. 1,:'26, 27). —And then he carried, as it
  were, his life in his hands. The reviling of the Jews might at any
  hour burst into furious violence or deliberate plots of assassination.
  The temptation of such a moment of human weakness was to fall
  back, when words seemed fruitless, into the safety of silence, and there-
  fore the command followed, 'Speak, and hold not thy peace.' "-
- Plumptre.
      9. In their violent opposition, what accusation did the Jews make
  against Paul when Gallio became governor? Verses 12, 13.
      NOTE.—"The increased success that Paul had in presenting Christ,
  roused the unbelieving Jews to more determined opposition. They rose
  in a body, and 'made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and
  brought him to the judgment seat' of Gallio, who was then proconsul of
  Aehaia. They expected that the authorities, as on former occasions,
  would side with them; and with loud, angry voices they uttered their
  complaints against the apostle, saying, 'This fellow persuadeth men to
  worship God contrary to the law.' "—"The Acts of the Apostles,"
  p. 252.
      10. How did Gallio, a man of integrity, dispose of the case, even
  before Paul had made any defense? Verses 14-16.
      NomE.—"Gallio was a man of integrity, and he refused to become
  the dupe of the jealous, intriguing Jews. Disgusted with their bigotry
  and self-righteousness, he would take no notice of the charge. As Paul
  prepared to speak in self-defense, Gallio told' him that it was not
  necessary."—Id., p. 253.
      11. How did the Greeks then treat Sosthenes, who was now in the
  place of the good Crispus? How was Gallio's favor toward Paul still
  further shown? Verse 17.
      NomE.—"For the first time during Paul's labors in Europe, the mob
  turned to his side; under the very eye of the proConsul, and without
  interference from him, they violently beset the most prominent ac-
  cusers of the apostle."—Ibid.
      12. After spending a year and a half in Corinth, where did. Paul
  then go? Who accompanied him to Ephesus? Verse 18.
      13. Why did he decline an urgent invitation to remain longer at
  Ephesus? Whom did he leave at Ephesus to follow up the interest
 awakened?
      NOTE.—Paul's "plan to visit Jerusalem prevented him from tarry-
 ing then, but he promised to return to them, 'if God will.' Aquila and
  Priscilla had accompanied him to Ephesus, and he left them there to
  carry on the work that he had begun."—Id., p. 269.
                                     ( 38
    14. How did Paul complete his second missionary journey?'
Verse 22.
   NOTE.—Starting from Antioch in Syria, Paul went by land over
the mountains and visited the churches in Cilicia and Galatia. Es-
pecial mention is made of his second visit to Derbe and Lystra.
    While seeking to go northward into Mysia and Bithynia, he was
hindered by the Spirit, and finally came to Troas.
    At Troas he was given a vision of the man of Macedonia praying
for help, and Paul and his friends came to Philippi.
    From Philippi he went to Thessalonica, thence to Berea, thence to
Athens, thence to Corinth.
    From Corinth he went to Ephesus, but would not remain on account
of his desire to attend the Passover feast at Jerusalem.
    Leaving Ephesus, he sailed to Cwsarea, then went up to Jerusalem
and saluted the church, returning to Antioch in Syria.
                       PERSONAL REFLECTIONS
   If we are right with God, we need not fear what man can do to
harm us.
   It is honorable to labor with our hands.
