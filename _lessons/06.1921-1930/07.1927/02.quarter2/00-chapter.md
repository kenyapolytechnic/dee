                               April 2,, 1927
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Acts 18: 23 to 19:20.
MEMORY VERSE: "Fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus

                        SETTING OF THE LESSON
   Starting on his third missionary journey, Pdul probably left Anti-
och in Syria early in A. D. 54, revisiting the churches which he had
previously founded in the provinces of Galatia and Phrygia; then(ie
he came to Ephesus, which was a prominent center in Asia. This mis-
sionary journey is supposed to have occupied a period of almost four
years.
                       Suggestions for Daily Family Study
    1. Read the "Setting of the Lesson," and Acts 18: 23 to 19: 7. Children
may trace on the map Paul's journey froth Antioch to Ephesus. Drill on the
memory verse each day.
    2. Study Questions 1-4, and note. Children may read paragraphs 1-3 of the
primary lesson. Read pages 269 and 270 of the Lesson Help.
    3. Study Questions 5-8, and notes. Children may read paragraphs 4 and 5 of
the primary lesson. Read pages 281-235 of the Lesson Help.
    4. Read Acts 19: 3-20. Let the children get the outline of this portion of the
lesson in mind: Paul preaching in a hall; miracles; sons of Sceva; burning of
books.
    5. Study Questions 9-15, and notes. Children may read paragraphs 6-9 of the
primary lesson. Read pages 285-290 of the Lesson Help.
    6. Study Questions 16 and 17, and note. Consider topics under "Personal
Reflections.' Children may read paragraphs 10-12 of the primary lesson.
    7. Review the lesson by asking ,questions from senior, youth's, junior, or pri-
mary lesson. Study notes in the 'Youth's Instructor." Ask questions under
heading, "Can You Tell?" in junior lesson.
                                 THE LESSON
    1. Leaving Antioch, what provinces did Paul visit in beginning his
third missionary.journey? Acts 18: 23.
    2. Who preceded Paul in visiting the city of Ephesus? Verse 24.
    3. How did Apollos gain a fuller knowledge of the gospel message?
Verses 25, 26.
    NOTE.—Apollos "had heard the preaching of John the Baptist, had
received the baptism of repentance, and was a living witness that the
work of the prophet had not been in vain."—"The Acts of the
Apostles," p. 269.
    4. What is said of the further labors of Apollos? Verses 27, 28.
                                       [3 ]
    5. On meeting some of the disciples of Apollos at Ephesus, what
questions did Paul ask them? How did they reply? Acts 19: 1-3.
    NOTE.—"They were leading a life of fasting, and prayers, and
alms; but they bad not passed on to 'righteousness, and peace, and joy
in the Holy Ghost.' "—Plumptre.
     6. What instruction did Paul give them? Verse 4.
    NOTE.—It is interesting to note in this connection how Paul later
rebuked the spirit of partisanship. See 1 Cor. 1:12, 13; 3:21-23.
As this spirit is not unknown in the church to-day, we would do well to
heed the following instruction: "He who sends forth gospel workers
as His ambassadors is dishonored when there is manifested among the
hearers so strong an attachment to some favorite minister that there is
an unwillingness to accept the labors of some other teacher. The Lord
sends help to His people, not always as they may choose, but as they
need; for men are short-sighted, and can not discern what is for their
highest good. It is seldom that one minister has all the qualifications
necessary to perfect a church in all the requirements of Christianity;
therefore God often sends to them other ministers, each possessing
some qualifications in which the others were deficient.
    "The church should gratefully accept these servants of Christ, even
as they would accept the Master Himself. They should seek to derive
all the benefit possible from the instruction which each minister niay
give them from the word of God. The truths that the servants of God
bring are to be accepted and appreciated in the meekness of humility,
but no minister is to be idolized."—"The Acts of the Apostles," pp.
277, 278.
    7. How did the disciples of Apollos respond to this instruction?
Verse 5.
    NOTE.—"The New Testament phrase is 'baptized in' or 'into,' to
express the close union with God into which men are brought by bap-
tism."—Cambridge Bible.
    8. What demonstration of the Holy Spirit followed this instance
of rebaptism? Verses 6, 7.
    NOTE.—"As at Jerusalem, so here was the Spirit given in this great
center of Gentile activity that a like result might follow, and that the
amazement and marvel at such a power might win attention to the
message and gain converts to Christ."—Cambridge Bible.
                                                       •
    9. How long did Paul continue to speak in the synagogue at Ephe-
sus? What is said of his manner of work? Verse 8.
    10. How were some affected by Paul's teaching? What did their
evil speaking lead him to do? Where did he afterwards take the be-
lievers for further instruction? Verse 9.
    NOTE.—We know nothing more of Tyraunus. This "school" might
have been a lecture room, or ball, rented to Paul for a portion of each
day. Paul undoubtedly worked at his trade in this city as he had at
Corinth.
                                  [ 4]
        11. How long did Paul remain there? . How extensive was the in-
' fluence of his work? Verse 10.
        NOTE.—"The audience of Paul was made up not of-the settled in-
     habitants of Ephesus only, but of those who visited the city for busi-
     ness or pleasure, and carried news of the preacher and his message to
    all corners of the district."—Cambridge Bible.           ,
      12.. How did God manifest His power through the great apostle?
   Verses 11, 12.
      NOTE.—"The imperfect tense of the verb in the Greek implies that
   these manifestations of God's power were continued during the
   apostle's stay. This was no mere spasmodic excitement over some
   powerful discourse."—Cambridge Bible.
       13. What attempt was made to counterfeit Paul's'work? Verses
   13, 14.
       14. What results followed this attempt? Verses 15, 16.
       15. How were the efforts of these apostate teachers overruled for
   the furtherance of the gospel? Verse 17.
       NOTE.—"Thus unmistakable proof was given of the sacredness of
   the name of Christ, and the peril which they incurred who should in-
   voke it without faith in the divinity of the Saviour's mission."—"The
   Acts of the Apostles," p. 288.
      16. How were the true fruits of repentance shown by many?
   Verses 18, 19.
      NOTE.—"These treatises on divination contained rules and forms
   of communication with evil spirits. They were the regulations of the
   worship of Satan,—directions for soliciting his help and obtaining in-
   formation from him. By retaining these books the disciples would
   have exposed themselves to temptation; by selling them they would
   have placed temptation in the way of others."—"The Acts of the
   Apostles," pp. 288, 289.
       "In this Greek city the pieces of silver were probably Attic drach-
   mas, worth about twenty cents each, the whole being worth ten thou-
  'sand dollars, but in purchasing power that sum was equal to perhaps
   one hundred thousand dollars of our money."—Peloubet.
        17. After this victory for the truth, what is said of the word of
    God? Verse 20.
                          PERSONAL REFLECTIONS
        One may be a true Christian while ignorant of some of the most
    blessed truths of the gospel. When clearer light comes, he must ac-
    cept it, if he would continue in the faith. Acts 18: 25.
        From every true Christian there goes forth power;. it is a blessing
    to come in contact with hitt. Acts 19: 12.
        God sometimes overcomes the wonders and works of opponents by
    greater wonders and better works. Verse 17.
        The proof of our being Christians is seen in the giving up of all
    wrong no matter what the cost, and the acceptance of the right. Verses
    18, 19.
                                      [5]
                     TROUBLE AT EPHESUS

             •   r
                   SETTING OF THE LESSON
    Paul, under the impression that his labors in Ephesus were thawing
to a close, mapped out for himself his further journeys.
    "For over three years Ephesus was the center of Paul's work. A
flourishing church was raised up here, and from this city. the gospel
spread throughout the province of Asia, among both Jews and• Gen-
tiles. . . .
    "Once a year, special ceremonies were held at Ephesus in honor of
the goddess Diana. These attracted great numbers of people from all
parts of the province. Throughout this period, festivities were con-
ducted with the utmost pomp and splendor.
    "This- gala season was a trying time for those who had newly come
to the faith. The company of believers who met in the school of Tyran-
nus were an inharmonious note in the festive chorus, and ridicule, re-
proach, and insult were freely heaped upon them."—"The Acts of the
Apostles," pp. 291, 292.
                         Suggestions for Daily Family Study
     1. Read the "Setting of the Lesson" and the Lesson Scripture. Drill on the
memory verse each day.
     2. Study Questions 1-3, and notes. Children may read paragraphs 1 and 2 of
the primary lesson. Consult a Bible Dictionary for a further description of the
temple of Diana than that given in the note.
     3. Study Questions 4-8, and note. Children may read paragraphs 3-6 of the
primary lesson. Read pages 291-293 of the Lesson Help.
     4. Study Questions 9-12, and notes. Children may read paragraph 7 of the
primary lesson. Read pages 293 and 294 of the Lesson Help.
     5. Study Questions 13-17. Children may read paragraphs 8 and 9 of the
primary lesson. Read pages 295.297 of the Lesson Help.
     6. Relate the story of the lesson,‘giving all details, each member of the family
 taking part. Discuss the topics under heading, "Special Questions" in junior
lesson, if the "Youth's Instructor" is available.
     7. Review the lesson by asking questions from any of the- lesson sheets. Read
notes in the "Youth's Instructor." Discuss questions under "Personal Reflec-
tions."
                                   THE LESSON
    1. As Paul's work at Ephesus was about completed, what further
travels did he contemplate? Acts 19: 21.
    2. Who preceded him into Macedonia? Verse 22.
    NOTE.—"Feeling that the cause in Ephesus still demanded his
presence, he [Paul] decided to remain until after Pentecost. An event
soon occurred, however, which hastened his departure."—"The Acts of
the Apostles," p. 291.
    3. What agitation was started at that time? Who led in, the
                              L61
LA LIMC 1.114 L was matte wnat was nis Occupation What is sant or

the profits of the business? Verses 23, 24.
    NOTE.—"An extensive and profitable busine-ss had grown up at
Ephesus from the manufacture and sale of small shrines and images,
modeled after the temple and the image of Diana."—"The Acts of the
Apostles," p. 292.
    The Temple of Diana was one' of the seven wonders of the ancient
world, and was two hundred twenty years in building. It was built
of purest marble and is said to have "gleamed far off with a starlike
radiance." One hundred twenty pillars, some of which were carved
with designs of exquisite beauty surrounded the structure.\ In the
center of the, building was the shrine containing the image of Diana
which was hidden from view by the vast folds of a purple embroidered
curtain of finest texture. It is probable that "there was no religious
building in the world in which was concentrated a greater amount of
admiration, enthusiasm, and superstition."
   4. What appeal did Demetrius make to his fellow craftsmen?
Verse 25.
  .5. Who did Demetrius say was responsible for the decline in their
business of making shrines? Verse 26.
    6. How did he further appeal to the idolatrous prejudices of the
people?‘Verse 27.
    NOTE.—There was constant deniand for the silver shrines. The
rich bought them and gave them to the temple, where they were hung.
The priests occasionally cleared away the older ones to make room for
new gifts. Some of these statues were placed in dwellings for the
protection of the honie; small ones were worn or carried as charms
against disease or accident. There was large sale to travelers, pil-
grims, and merchants who visited Ephesus.
    7. What was the effect of the speech of Demetrius? Verse 28.
    8. Upon whom did the people vent theii anger? Verse 29.
    9. How was Paul prevented from entering the theater? Verses
30, 31.
    NOTE.—"A report of this speech was rapidly circulated. 'The
whole city was filled with confusion.' Search was made for Paul, but
the apostle was not to be found. His brethren, receiving an intimation
of the danger, had hurried him from the place. Angels of God had
been sent to guard the apostle; his time to die a martyr's death had
not yet come. . .
    "Paul's place of 'concealment was not far distant, and he soon
learned of the peril of his beloved brethren. Forgetful of his own
safety, he desired to go at once to the theater to address the rioters.
But 'the disciples suffered him not.' Gaius and Aristarchus were not
the prey the people sought; no serious harm to them was apprehended.
But should. the apostle's pale, care-worn face be seen, it would arouse
at once the worst passions of the mob, and there would not be the least
human possibility of saving his life."—"The Acts of the Apostles,"
p. 293.
                                   [7 ]
    10. What state of confusion marked this great assemblage of
people? Verse 32.
    11. Whom did the Jews put forward in their defense? Verse 33.
    NOTE.—The fact that Paul and some of his companions were Jews
no doubt made the Jews of Ephesus feel that odium was cast upon
them. To let it' be known that they had no sympathy with the Chris-
tians, they chose one of their own number to set the matter before the
people.
    12. How was Alexander the Jew prevented from making his
speech? Verse 34.
    Nora.—Alexander was one of the craftsmen, a, coppersmith, to
whom Paul afterwards referred as having done him much harm.
2 Tim. 4:14. But the crowd was in no mood to make fine distinc-
tions. Seeing he was a Jew, they thrust him aside, the uproar continu-
ally increasing.
    13. When this two-hour tumult ceased, what appeal was made by
the town clerk? Verses 35, 36.
    14. What defense of Paul and his companions did the town clerk
make? Verse 37.
    15. "Upon whom did he place the responsibility for the unseemly
disturbance? What advice did he give? Verses 38, 39.
    16. What did he say might be the result of the disorder? What
was the effect of this speech by the town clerk? • Verses 40, 41.
    17. How does Paul speak of this experience at Ephesus? 1 Cor.
15: 32.
                     PERSONAL REFLECTIONS
    How do my life, labors, and sacrifices compare with those of the
great hero of this lesson?
    If I am certain I am right, need I employ rash or radical measures
to convince others?
    Does the Lord protect His servants in the midst of danger and tu-
mult now as He did in Paul's day?

                    SETTING OF THE LESSON
   Paul desired to end his third missionary tour by returning to Jeru-
salem in time for the feast of Pentecost. This feast would give him
"an opportunity to meet those who should come from all parts of the
                                  8
world to attend the feast. Ever he cherished the hope that in some
way he might be instrumental in removing the prejudice of his unbe-
lieving countrymen, so that they might be led to accept the pYecious
light of the gospel. He also desired to meet the church at Jerusalem,
and bear to them the gifts sent by the Gentile churches to the poor
brethren in Judea. And by this visit he hoped to bring about a firmer
union between the Jewish and the Gentile converts to the faith."—

    Nora.—"In the autumn he [Paul] went to Greece and spent three
months there, chiefly in Corinth, where he had much to do amid sick-
ness and afflictions on every side, fightings without and fears within
(2 Cor. 4:7-11), in caring for all the churches (2 Cor. 11:28), and
correcting wrong conduct (2 Cor. 12:20, 21; 13:1, 2). It was four or
five years since he had left them after a stay of a year and a half."—
Peloubet.
    4. How long did the apostle remain at Corinth? For what reason
did he change his plan to sail directly to Palestine? Acts 20:3.
    NOTE.—"Having completed his work at Corinth, he determined to
sail directly for one of the ports on the coast of Palestine. All the ar-
rangements had been made, and he was about to step on board the
ship, when he was told of a plot laid by the Jews to take his life. In
the past these opposers of the faith had been foiled in all their efforts
to put an end to the apostle's work.
    "Upon receiving warning of the plot, Paul decided to go around by
way of Macedonia. His plan to reach Jerusalem in time for the Pass-
over services had to be given up, but he hoped to be there at Pente-
cost."—"The Acts of the Apostles," pp. 389, 390.

ments for these representative brethren from various contributing
churches, to accompany him to Jerusalem."—"The Acts of the Apos-
tles," p. 390.
   6. How long did Paul and his company remain at Troas? Verse 6.
   NOTE.—"At Philippi Paul tarried to keep the Passover. Only
Luke remained with him, the other members of the company passing
on to Troas to await him there. The Philippians werethe most loving
and true-hearted of the apostle's converts, and during the eight days of
the feast he enjoyed peaceful and happy communion with them."—
"The Acts of the Apostles," pp. 390, 391.
    7. On what day of the week was the farewell meeting held? To
what time did Paul continue his speech? Verses 7, 8.
    NOTE.—"The labors of the early days of the week that was spent
at Troas are not related to us, but concerning the last day we have a
narrative which enters into 'details with all the minuteness of orie of
the Gospel histories. It was tthe evening which -succeeded the Jewish
Sabbath."—"Life and Epistles of the Apostle Paul," Conybeare and
Howson, p. 520.
    "The meeting was held on what we should call Saturday evening;
but we must remember that the Jewish first day began from sundown
on Saturday or the Sabbath."—"The Expositor's Bible," Vol. 2, p. 393.
See Gen. 1:15; Lev. 23:32; Mark 1:32.

ing, what does Luke say he and his companions were doing? Verses
13, 14.
    NOTE.—The distance across country by a well-paved road from
Troas to Assos was about nineteen miles,1 which could be traveled on
foot in much less than the sailing time around the promontory.
    11. Trace the route from Assos to Miletus. What was Paul's
reason for sailing by Ephesus without visiting his former field of
labor? Verses 15, 16.
    NoTE.—"As the travelers sailed southward from Assos, they passed
the city of Ephesus, so long the scene of the apostle's labors. Paul
had greatly desired to visit the church there; for he had important in-
struction and counsel to give them. But upon consideration he deter-
mined to hasten on; for he desired, 'if it were possible for him, to be
                                  C 10]
at' Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.'""The Acts of the Apostles,"
p. 392.
    12. When Paul learned that the ship would tarry for a time in the
harbor at Miletus, what means did he take of communicating with the'
Ephesian believers? Verse 17.
    NOTE.— Ephesus was about thirty miles north from Miletus. The
time of the ship's sailing being uncertain, Paul sent for the leaders of
the church at Ephesus to meet him at Miletus, where followed one of
the most touching addresses ever spoken.
    13. How does the apostle begin his address to the Ephesian elders?
How faithful had been his labors among them? Verses 18-21.
    14. With what uncertainty did he contemplate his future labors?7
Verses 22, 23.
                 "I know not what awaits me;
                     God kindly veils mine eyes,
                  And o'er each step of my onward way
                     He makes new scenes to rise;

                • "Where He may lead I'll follow,
                    My trust in Him repose;
                   And every hour in perfect peace
                    I'll sing, 'He knows! He knows !' "
                                 —P. P. Bliss. From the last song written
                                  before the accident which caused his death.

   15. What shows that Paul did not allow this uncertainty to weaken
him in his purpose? Verse 24.
    16. What solemn declaration did he make to the Ephesian brethren?
Verses 25-27.
    NOTE.—"Paul had not designed to bear this testimony, but while
he was speaking, the Spirit of inspiration came upon him, confirming.
his fears thal this would be his last meeting with his Ephesian breth-
ren."—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 393.
    17. What solemn charge did he give them? Of what did he warm
them? Verses 28-30.
    NOTE.—Paul warns the elders against two dangers which threat-
ened the church,—wolves from without that would come in to destroy,.
and those of their own number who would arise in their midst, who.
would cast away their for,mer faith, and would teach things contrary to•
the truth. In this way, division in the church would be created, and
these false brethren would draw away some of the flock after them..
Observe that these disciples are drawn to these "false brethren" in-
stead of to Christ. This danger still threatens the church.
    18. Of what did Paul remind them? To what source of divine
power and grace did the apostle direct them? What is the word of
God able to do? Verses 31, 32.
    19. What had Paul not coveted? What example had he given them?
What words of Jesus did he ask them to remember? Verses 33-35.
                                  [ 111
   ,20. Describe the scene of Paul's leave-taking of the Ephesian
brethren. Verses 36-38.
                       PERSONAL REFLECTIONS
    Does the Holy Spirit bring to my soul, as it did to that of Paul,
the comforting conviction that I am pure from the blood of all men"?
    Am I as diligent and faithful in my sphere of activity as I ought
to be?
    Will the troubles of the future be able to move me from my course'?

                                  THE LESSON
   1. Having said farewell to the brethren who met him at Miletus,
where did Paul go next? (Trace on the map.) Acts 21:1.
   2. What transfer was made at Patara? Verse 2. '
   3. What island did they pass on the voyage? At what port did
they land? Verse 3.
                               [ 12
    NoTE.—Sailing within sight of Cyprus, the apostle Paul could
hardly fail to recall his experience with Elymas, the sorcerer, when
visiting that island in company with Barnabas.
    4. How long did they remain at Tyre? What counsel was given to
Paul? Verse 4.
    NOTE.—"At Tyre, where the ship was unloaded, they found a few
disciples, with whom they were permitted to tarry seven days.. Through
the Holy Spirit, these disciples were warned of the perils awaiting
Paul at Jerusalem, and they urged him 'that he should not go up to
Jerusalem.' But the apostle allowed not the fear of affliction and im-
prisonment to turn him from his purpose."—"The Acts of the Apos-
tles," p. 396.
    5. Describe Paul's leave-taking of the believers at Tyre.' Verses
5, 6.
   •NOTE.—The last parting moments here, as at Miletus, were em-
ployed in praying to Him who alone can give true comfort and pro-
tection. This contains a lesson we all will do well to heed.
   6. What was the next place at which Paul and his Company
stopped? Verse 7.
   7. What place did they reach the following day? Who provided
them entertainment at Cxsarea? Verse 8.
   NoTE.—This is the same Philip who preached the gospel to he
Samaritans, and baptized the Ethiopian eunuch.
   "Here Paul spent a few peaceful, happy days—the last of perfect
freedom that he was to enjoy for a long time."—"The Acts of the
Apostles," p. 397.
   8. What is said of Philip's four daughters? Verse 9.
    9. What prediction did the prophet Agabus make concerning Paul?
Verses 10, 11..
    NOTE.—"His [Agabus's] revelation was made in that dramatic
form which impresses the mind with a stronger sense of reality than
mere words can do, and which was made familiar to the Jews of old by
the practice of the Hebrew prophets. As Isaiah (chapter 20), loosed
the sackcloth from his loins, and put off his shoes from his feet, to de-
clare how the Egyptian captives should be led away into Assyria naked
and barefoot,—or as the girdle of Jeremiah (chapter 13), in its
strength and its decay, was made a type of the people of Israel in
their privilege and their fall,—Agabus, in like manner, using the
imagery of action, took the girdle of St. Paul, and fastened it round
his own hands and feet, and said, 'Thus saith the Holy Ghost: So shall
the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man to whom this girdle belongs, and
they shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.' "—"Life and
Epistles of the Apostle Paul," Conybeare and Howson.
    10. What united warning was given Paul by his companions in
travel and the believers in Cxsarea? Verse 12.
    NomE.7--"Both at Tyre and at Csarea, prophets warned Paul of
the danger of going to Jerusalem. It was revealed to them, not that
                                 [ 13 ]
Paul should not go, but that if he went, he Would go into bonds,
prison; and sufferings. The prophets inferred from this foreknowledge
that Paul should not go on. But Paul recognized more clearly the
voice of the Spirit and his duty to proceed in spite of warnings and
remonstrances."—Peloubet.
    11. What reply did Paul make to their warnings? What was the
effect of his reply? Verses 13, 14.
   12. At what place was the third missionary journey terminated?
VerSe 15.
   NOTE.—"Never before had the apostle approached Jerusalem with
so sad a heart. He knew-that he would find few friends and many
enemies. He was nearing the city which had rejected and slain the
Son of God, and over which now hung the threatenings of divine wrath.
Remembering how bitter had been his own prejudice against the fol-
lowers of Christ, he felt the deepest pity for his deluded countrymen.
And yet how little could he hope that he would be able to help them!
The same blind wrath which had once burned in his own heart, was
now with, untold power kindling the hearts of a whole nation against
him."—"The Acts of the Apostles," pp. 397, 398.
   13. Who joined them at Cmsarea on their journey to Jerusalem?
Verse 16.
   NOTE.—"Some of the Christians of Caesarea went along with them,
not merely, as it would seem, to show their respect and sympathy for
the apostolic company, but to secure their comfort on arriving by tak-
ing him to the house of Mnason, a native of Cyprus, who had been
long ago converted to Christianity,—possibly during the life of our
Lord Himself,—and who may have been one of those Cyprian Jews
who first made the gospel known to the Greeks at Antioch."—"Life and
Epistles of the Apostle Paul," Conybeare and Howson.
     14. How were Paul and his companions received at Jerusalem?
Verse 17.
     Noma.—Paul arrived at Jerusalem in time for the feast of Pente-
cost. This was his fifth visit to Jerusalem since his conversion many
years before.
                        PERSONAL REFLECTIONS
     We must maintain a very close connection with Heaven to be as
certain as Paul was of the path of duty.
     The times are very uncertain. In parting with friends or brethren,
it is well to make prayer a part of the farewell.
     Life itself must be kept continually on the altar.

  LESSON SCRIPTURE: Acts 21: 18-40.

                         SETTING OF THE LESSON
    The meeting of Paul, the Lord's chosen apostle to the Gentiles,
with the Jewish believers in Jerusalem, was an occasion of more than
ordinary interest. James, the brother of Jesus, still occupied a posi-
tion of responsibility in the church there. None of the twelve apostles
are mentioned. They were probably widely scattered on various mis-
sions. Some of the leading brethren at Jerusalem still cherished preju-
dice against the methods of Paul and his associates. Paul felt that if
he could remove this prejudice, he would clear away a great hindrance
to the success of the work of the gospel; but the counsel of the breth-
ren to Paul was not in harmony with the will of God.
                        Suggestions for Daily Family Study
     1. Read the "Setting of the Lesson" and the Lesson Scripture. Drill on the
 memory verse each day.

 Instructor," if the paper is available.
     7. Review the lesson by asking questions from any of the lesson'sheets. Read
 notes in the "Youth's Instructor." Consider topics under "Personal Reflections."
                                  THE LESSON
    1. What report of his labors, did Paul make to the brethren at Je-
 rusalem? Acts 21: 18, 19.
    NomE.—"In the eight years since Paul had reported his work to the
 church at Jerusalem at the great conference (Acts 18: 21, 22), he had
 (1) made two long missionary tours; (2) revisited and strengthened
 the churches in Asia, Minor; (3) he had carried the gospel into
 Europe; (4) he had founded large churches in Philippi, Corinth, Thes-
 salonica, and Ephesus; (5) he had been the means of great numbers of
 conversions, and the great extension of the gospel; (6) some of the
 converts had been willing to endure much for the gospel; (7) they bad
 sent large, contributions by Paul to the poor at Jerusalem; (8)' special
 miracles had been wrought by the hand of Paul."—Peloubet: •
    2. How was this report received? Verse 20.
                                        [ 15]
    3. What did Paul present to the leaders of the work at Jerusalem?
    NOTE.—"On this occasion, Paul and his companions formally pre-
sented to the leaders of the work at Jerusalem the contributions for-
warded by the Gentile churches for the support of the poor among their
Jewish brethren. The gathering of these contributions had cost the
apostle and his fellow workers much time, anxious thought, and weari-
some labor. The sum, which far exceeded the expectations of the
elders at Jerusalem, represented many sacrifices and even severe priva-
tions on the part f the Gentile believers."—"The Acts of the Apos-
tles," p. 399.
   4. Of what did they say the brethren at Jerusalem had been in-
formed concerning Paul's labors? Verses 21, 22.
    5. What did they urge Paul to do? Verses 23, 24.
    NOTE.—"This was the golden opportunity for all the leading breth-
ren to confess frankly that God had wrought through Paul, and that at
times they had erred in permitting the reports of his enemies to arouse
their jealousy and prejudice. But instead of uniting in an effort to
do justice to the one who had been injured, they gave him counsel
which showed that they still cherished a feeling that Paul should be
held largely responsible for the existing prejudice. They did not stand
nobly in his defense, endeavoring to show the disaffected ones where
they were wrong, but sought to effect a compromise by counseling him
to pursue a course which in their opinion would remove all cause for
misapprehension."—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 403.
    "He [Paul] felt that if by any reasonable concession he could win
them to the truth, he would remove a great obstacle to the success of
the gospel in other places. But he was not authorized of God to con-
cede as much as they asked."—Id., p, 405.
    6. What compromise did Paul make in yielding to their demands?
Verse 26.
    NOTE.—"When we think of Paul's great desire t9 be in harmony
with his brethren, his tenderness toward the weak in the faith, his
reverence for the apostles who had been with Christ, and for James,
the brother of the Lord, and his purpose to become all things to all
men so far, as he could without sacrificing principle,—when we think
of all this, it is less surprising that he was constrained to deviate from
the firm, decided course that he had hitherto followed."—"The Acts of
the Apostles," p. 405.
    7. Were the results of this concession what the elders had expected?
Verse 27.
    NOTE. But instead of accomplishing the desired object, his ef-
forts for conciliation only precipitated the crisis, hastened his pre-
dicted sufferings, and resulted in separating him from his brethren, t
depriving the church of one of its strongest pillars, and bringing sor-
row to Christian hearts in every land."—"The Acts of the Apostles,"

                     PERSONAL REFLECTIONS
    Any deviation from right principles to gain a seeming present ad-
vantage, always hinders the cause of right and truth which we may be
trying to advance.
    Paul was not irritated by criticism, and was ever ready to listen to
counsel. Rom. 12-: 3, 16.
  • Paul, in the confusion on' the stairway, was calmly thinking how he
could secure an opportunity to testify for Christ. 2 Tim. 4: 2.

  PAUL'S ADDRESS ON THE CASTLE STAIRS

LESSON SCRIPTURE: Acts 22.
MEMORY VERSE: "This is My commandment, That ye love one another, as
   I have loved you." John 15: 12.
LESSON HELP: "The Acts of the Apostles," pp. 408-410.
                     SETTING OF THE LESSON
    Paul had been seized by *the angry Jews while he was in the temple,
and they sought to take his life. He was protected from his enemies
by Roman soldiers under the command of Claudius Lysias, the chief
captain. As the soldiers were taking him up the'steps into the Castle
of Antonia, at the northwest corner of the temple area, Paul asked
permission to speak to the Jews, and the captain gave consent. "Paul's
every word and act at this moment of supreme danger evince remark-
able courage, coolness, and self-possession. His one thought now was
to seize the occasion of speaking to the people, when he had a great
crowd before him, with their attention fixed on him. This might be an
opportunity of bringing the truth to them."

notes in the "Youth's Instructor." Consider topics under "Personal Reflections."
                           THE LESSON
    1. By what courteous introduction did Paul gain the attention of
his hearers? Acts 22: 1.
   '2. What helped him to arouse their interest? Verse 2.
    NomE.—"Had he [Paul] spoken in Greek, the majority of those
who heard him would have understood his words. But the sound of the
holy tongue in that holy place fell like a calm on the troubled waters.
The silence became universal and breathless."—"Life and Epistles of
the Apostle Paul," Conybeare and Howson-.
     3. What did Paul say of his early life and training? How did he
refer to his former zeal as a persecutor of the Christians? Verses 3-5.
    NomE.—Gamaliel was the most famous teacher of that time. "His
learning was so eminent and his character so revered, that he is one of
the seven who alone among Jewish doctors have been honored with the
title of ‘Rabban.' " He it was who gave counsel against slaying Peter
and others. Acts 5: 34-40. He was still living, an aged man, when
Paul spoke, but died three years later, while Paul was on his journey
to Rome. The burial honors of a king were given him, while his pupil
was to be put to death as a criminal. But in another school, at the
feet of the divine Teacher, this pupil had exchanged the dead forms of
learned rabbinical teaching for the life-transforming and saving truths
of the gospel, "determined not to know anything, . . . save Jesus
Christ, and Him crucified." 1 Cor. 2: 2.
  ' 4. How does Paul say he was arrested in his wrong course? Acts
22:6.
    5. What conversation does he repeat? Verses 7, 8.
    NomE.—Saul saw that Just One, and heard His voice; and that one
glimpse of the Saviour won his soul, and• changed his life. It was
conversion. Not with the same physical demonstration, but just as
really, Jesus, by His Spirit, seeks to reveal Himself to every soul.
    6. How were his companions affected by this vision? Verse 9.
    NOTE.—To the casual reader there may appear to be a contradic-
tion between verse 9 of this chapter and verse 7 of chapter 9.
   "Paul heard intelligible words, the others heard a sound, but it was
not speech to them. 'Heard not the voice,' that is, the words which

  them."—Cambridge Bible.
     7. What was Paul's first question after recognizing that Jesus was
  the Lord? What reply did Paul receive to his anxious question?
  Verse 10.
      8. How was he enabled, in his blindness,' to reach Damascus?
  Verse 11.
      9. How was he delivered from this helpless condition? Verses
  12, 13.
      10. What message did Ananias bear to him? Verses 14, 15.
       11. To what Christian duty was his attention next called? Verse 16.
     12. When Paul made his first visit to Jerusalem after his conver-
  sion, what experience came to him? Verses 17, 18.
     13. What led him at that time to feel that he ought to bear his wit-
1 ness in Jerusalem? Verses 19, 20.
     14. At what point in Paul's address did they cease to hear him?
  Verses 21, 22.
     NOTE.—"Hitherto the people had listened with close attention, but
  when Paul reached the point in his history where he was appointed
  Christ's ambassador to the Gentiles, their fury broke forth anew. Ac-
  customed to look upon themselves as the only people favored by God,
  they were unwilling to permit the despised Gentiles to share the privi-
  leges which had hitherto been regarded as exclusively thir own. Lift-
  ing their voices above the voice of the speaker, they cried, 'Away with
  such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.' "—
  "The Acts of the Apostles," pp. 409, 410.
     15. What command`was given by the chief captain? Verses 23,.24.
      NOTE.—"He [the chief captain] had not been able to understand
  the apostle's Hebrew speech; and when he saw its results, he concluded
  that his prisoner must be guilty of some enormous crime; . . . and
  before long, the body of the apostle was 'stretched out,' like that of a
  common malefactor, `to receive the lashes.' "—"Life and Epistles of
  the Apostle Paul," Conybeare and Howson.
    16. How was the captain's plan interrupted? Verses 25, 26.
     NomE.—"The Valerial law forbade any Roman citizen to be bound.
  The Porcian law forbade any to be beaten with rods."—Clarke.
     17. What conversation followed? With what result? Verses
  27-29.
     18. What action was taken by the chief captain the next day?
  Verse 30.
     NOTE.—"The apostle was now to be tried by the same tribunal of
  which he himself had been a member before his conversion. As he
  stood before the Jewish rulers, his bearing was calm, and his counte-
  nance revealed the peace of Christ."—"The Acts of the Apostles,"
  pp. 410, 411.
                                    [ 19 ]

       PAUL BEFORE THE COUNCIL; A PLOT
                MADE KNOWN
                               May 14, 1927
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Acts 23.
MEMORY VERSE: "God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in

                        SETTING OF THE LESSON
    Paul had been ejected from the temple and roughly treated, but
Claudius Lysias, the chief captain, had been unable to find out what
the apostle had done that was wrong, for in the confusion "some cried
one thing, some another, among the multitude." When Paul spoke
from the castle stairs, Lysias could not understand him, for he spoke
in the Hebrew tongue. When the Jews cried out and would listen
longer, the chief captain thought Paul must be a very wicked man.
He gave orders to have him scourged, expecting that he.would then
confess his evil deeds; but Paul let it be known that he was a Roman
citizen, and this plan was abandoned as "unlawful." Then the chief
captain commanded the Sanhedrin to meet and set Paul before them,
that he might understand what fault the Jews found with him.

notes in the "Youth's Instructor.' Consider topics under "Personal Reflections."
                                THE LESSON
   1. When Paul was brought before the Sanhedrin,.what was his
opening statement? Acts 23: 1.
                                     [ 20
    2. How was the apostle's declaration of sincerity received?
Verse 2.
    NOTE.—The high priest Ananias presiding over th'e council, accord-
ing to Josephus, was a tyrant of violent and unscrupulous conduct.
"This unscrupulous man, angry at Paul's claim to be innocent, while
the Jews, by word and act, had publicly treated him as a criminal
worthy of death, 'commanded them that stood by him to smite him on
the mouth.' "—Peloubet.
   3. How did Paul show such a command to be unworthy the office
of high priest? Verse 3.
    NOTE.—"`God shall smite thee,' is about to smite thee. Not a
malediction, or a wishing of evil upon the high priest; but, like
Christ's woes against the scribes and Pharisees, an expression of his
belief that such conduct would be punished and ought to be punished.
Within two years this Ananias was deposed, and four years later he
met a terrible death at the beginning of the Jewish wars."—Peloubet.
   4. What did those standing by ask Paul? What excuse did Paul
offer? What words did he quote to show his respect fof those in
authority? Verses 4, 5.
   NoTE.—Paul did not know it was the high priest who spoke. In
reality, Ananias was not legally the high priest. He had been deposed
from the office for bad conduct, and sent to Rome to, answer. Re-
leased, he returned to Jerusalem, and found that his successor had
been assassinated, and the office was vacant. "The Sanhedrin being
destitute of a president, Ananias appears to have discharged that of-
fice by his own authority, and with much tyranny, and he might not
then have worn the robes of the high priest."—Henry and Scott's
Commentary. But Paul respected the office, however perverted.
   5. What was Paul quick to perceive in the council? What advan-
tage did he take of this? Verse 6.
   NOTE.—Paul's belief in the resurrection had been Confirmed by the
tact that Jesus had risen from the grave. 1 Cor. 15:16-18.
  6. What confusion did Paul's statement make in-the council?
What did the Pharisees cry out? Acts 23:7-9.
   7. How was he again rescued from the violence of the mob?
Verse 10.
   NoTE.—"The result was that the council came to no decision as to
the charge against Paul, but continued to quarrel so fiercely among
themselves that the soldierp were compelled to rescue Paul again, and
bring him into Castle Antonia."—Peloubet.
    8. What cheering message came to Paul from the Lord, following
his rescue from mob violence? Verse 11.
    NOTE.—"While reflecting on the trying experiences of the day, Paul
began to fear that his course might not have been pleasing to God.
Could it be that he had made a mistake after all in visiting Jerusalem?
Had his great desire to be in union with his brethren led to this dis-
astrous result? . . .
                                [ 21 ]
anxiety he thought of the perils of the scattered churches, exposed as
they were to the persecutions of just such men as he had encountered
in the Sanhedrin council. In %distress and discouragement he wept
and prayed. In this dark hour the Lord was not unmindful of His
servant."—"The Acts of the Apostles," pp. 412, 413.
    9. What desperate plot against Paul's life was entered into by a
large number of men? Verses 12, 13.
   10. 'What was the plan of the onspirators? Verses 14, 15.
   NOTE.—These men knew the character of the priests, and did not
hesitate to ask their cooperation in the plan to commit murder, to
which they had bound themselves by a religious oath, a "great" oath.
The priesthood had traveled the downward way so far that the buying
and selling of preferment was common, and the use of a class known as
professional assassins was not unknown in their own factional quarrels.
   11. How was this plot made known to Paul? What steps did Paul
then take? Verses 16, 17.
  12. How was this knowledge given to the chief captain, Lysias?
What appeal did the young man make? Verses,18-21.
   13. What timely action was taken by the chief captain? Verses
22-24.
    14. What friendly communication did Lysias, the chief captain,
send to Felix, the Roman governor? Verses 25-27.
    NorE.—"Lysias at once decided to transfer Paul from his jurisdic-
tion to that of Felix the procurator. As a people, the Jews were in a
state of excitement and irritation, and tumults were of frequent occur-
rence. The continued presence of the apostle in Jerusalem might lead
to consequences dangerous to the city, and even to the commandant
himself."—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 415.
   15. Wha preliminary steps did Lysias say he had taken in Paul's
case? How was the message of Lysias concluded? Verses 28-30.
   16. How far did the soldiers take Paul on the journey? Verse 31.E
    17. Who continued the journey with Paul to Cmsarea? Upon their
arrival, what did they do? Verses 32, 33.
 ' NorE.—So within a fortnight Paul was back at Cnsarea, where his
friends were who had besought him not to go up to Jerusalem. He
probably entered the city in the broad light of day, attended by "three-
score and ten" horsemen. How unlike his present escort was the
humble Christian company that had but a few days before attended
him on the journey from Ciesarea! Notwithstanding his changed sur-
roundings, he was no doubt recognized by"Philip and others whose
hearts were shocked and saddened at the calamity that had overtaken
their beloved leader.
    18. How was Paul received by Felix, the Roman governor? Verses
34, 35.
                               [ 22
            w nen a maws ways please the Lora, tie mattetn even ins
enemies to be at peace with him." Prov. 16: 7.
                        PERSONAL REFLECTIONS
    The Lord's message to Paul (Acts 23:11), at what must have been.
one of the most discouraging moments of his eventful life, is a beauti-
ful illustration of the assurance ta,every loyal Christian that, "the
Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptation." 2 Peter
2:9.
   Though Paul had the promise of God that he would be delivered, he
did all that human wisdom could suggest to aid himself.
   "Man's extremity is God's opportunity."



                                LESSON 8
       - PAUL ACCUSED BEFORE FELIX
                               May 21, 1927
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Acts 24.
MEMORY VERSE: "Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time;
   when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee." Acts 24: 25.
LESSON HELP: "The Acts of the Apostles," pp. 419-427.

              •         SETTING OF THE LESSON
    Paul had been brought to Caesarea under escort of a soldier guard
provided by Lysias, the chief captain in Jerusalem. Felix, the Roman
governor, had commanded that Paul be kept a prisoner in Herod's
judgment hall until his accusers came from Jerusalem to be present
              7
at his trial.
                         Suggestions for Daily Family Study
     1. Read the "Setting of the Lesson" and the Lesson Scripture. Drill on the
memory verse each day.
    2. Study Questions 1-5, and notes. Children may read paragraphs 1-4 of the
primary lesson. Read pages 419 and 420 of the Lesson Help.
    3. Study Questions 6-12, and notes. Children may read paragraphs 5-10 of
the primary lesson. Read pages 421 and 422 of the Lesson Help.
     4. Study Questions 13-17, and notes. Children may read paragraphs 11.13 of
the primary lesson. Read pages 423-427 of the Lesson Help.
     5. Study the meaning of the unusual words in this lesson, such as heresy,
void, tumult, clemency, sedition, profane, etc. Children may answer questions in
primary lesson.
    6. Tell the story of the lesson in detail, each member of the family taking
part. What is the teaching of this lesson on the following: Respect due author-
ities; the resurrection of the dead; God's care for His servants; improving op-
portunities of telling the gospel; the danger of delay in obedience.
     7. Review the lesson by asking questions from any of the lesson sheets. Read
notes in the "Youth's Instructor." Discuss questions under "Personal Reflec-
tions."
                                   THE LESSON
    1. How long was Paul kept waiting by Felix, before being brought
to trial? Who came from Jerusalem to attend the trial? Acts 24:1.
   2. By what false flattery did Tertullus introduce his speech?
Verses 2-4.
                                      [23 7
    NOTE.—The usual recourse was had to flowery and untruthful
flattery. Yet, while the character of Felix was base, he had put down
the bandits and robbers with an iron hand, and had pursued and
scattered the band of revolutionists led by the fanatical Egyptian, for
whom the Roman captain had at first mistaken Paul. Acts 21:38.
Paul's own manner of address, a few moments later (Acts 24: 10), was
respectful and complimentary, but without false flattery.
    Felix is said to have been the worst governor that ever ruled Judea.
"With all manner of cruelty and lust ho [Felix] exercised royal func-
tions in the spirit of a slave."—Tacitus, in Standard Bible Dictionary.
    3. What three charges were laid against Paul? Verses 5, 6.
    NOTE.—"The charge brought against the prisoner seems to have
included three particulars: (1) that he was guilty of sedition, and so
of disloyalty to the Roman government; (2) that he was guilty of
heresy, the ringleader of a sect, and so a renegade from Judaism; (3)
that he was guilty of profaning the temple, sand thus of affronting a
worship which was under the patronage and protection of Rome."—
Vaughn.
    4. What interference with the plans of the Jews did Tertullus re-
sent? What variation from the truth is noticeable in his words?
Verses 7, 8.
    5. How was the plea of Tertullus supported? Verse 9.
    NOTE.—"Felix had sufficient penetration to read the disposition and
character of Paul's accusers. He knew from what motive they had
flattered him, and he saw also that they had failed to substantiate
their charges against Paul. Turning to the accused, he beckoned to
him to answer for himself."—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 420.
    6. In what courteous terms did Paul open his defense? Verse 10.
    Nom.—In response to a gesture of invitation from the governor,
Felix, Paul answered Tertullus in a courteous way. "Paul felt at least
his judge had had, during his long years of office, ample opportunities
of becoming acquainted with the character of the leaders of the Jews,
with their jealousies and narrowness."—Schaff.
    7. How long did Paul say he had been in Jerusalem? Verse 11.
    8. In what      statement did he refute all three of the charges
laid against him? Verses 12, 13.
    NomE.—Paul showed that he had not been long enough in Jerusalem
to be the leader of a seditious party. He challenged proof of the
things charged. The Jews themselves were seditious, and plotters
against the superior civil authority, which latter they tried to over-
turn altogether. As a Christian, the apostle Paul was subject to the
powers of government in all things civil.
    9. What confession of faith did Paul make? Verses 14-16.
   .10. What did he say he had brought to the Jewish nation?
Verse 17.
    11. What was Paul's Story of his arrest at Jerusalem? Verses
18-21.
                               24]
     Nom.E.—"He came to make offerings in the temple, to worship there;
and he engaged in the Jewish rites and ceremonies there; how could
he then wish to profane the temple? 'And offerings.' The usual sac-
rifices customary at the feast of Pentecost, and also those special con-
tributions which were part of the Nazarite's vow (Acts 21:23-26)."—
Schaff.
     12. Until what time was further investigation of Paul's case de-
ferred? Verse 22.
     13. What liberty was given him as a prisoner? Verse 23.
     14. What private interview was afforded him in which to present
the gospel to Felix? Verse 24.
     NOTE.—"Paul regarded this as a God-given bpportunity, and faith-
fully he improved it. He knew that he stood in the presence of one
who had power to put him to death, or to set him free; yet he did not
address Felix and Drusilla with praise.or flattery. He knew that his
words would be to them a savor of life or of death, and forgetting all
selfish considerations, he sought to arouse them to a sense of their
peril."—"The Acts of the Apostles," pp. 422, 423.
     15. How did Felix manifest conviction as the claims of the gospel
were presented to him? Verse 25.
     NoTE.—"Felix felt that Paul's words were true. Memory went
 back over the guilty past. With terrible distinctness there came up
 before him the secrets of his early life of profligacy and bloodshed,,
 and the black 'record of his later years. He saw himself licentious,
 cruel, rapacious. Never before had the truth been thus brought home
 to his heart. Never before had his soul been so filled with terror. The
 thought that all the secrets of his career of crime were open before the
 eye of God, and that he must be judged according to his deeds, caused
 him to tremble with dread.
     "But instead of permitting his convictions to lead him to repent-
 ance, he sought to dismiss these unwelcome reflections. The interview
 with Paul was cut short. . . . He had slighted his last offer of mercy.
 Never was he to receive another call from God."—"The Acts of the
 Apostles," pp. 425-427.
    _ 16. What base motive influenced Felix? . What did he do in the
 hope of gain? Verse 26.
      NOTE.—"Felix visited him several times, and listened attentively to
  his words. But the real motive for this apparent friendliness was a
  desire for gain, and he intimated that by the payment of a large sum
  of money Paul might secure his release. The apostle, however, was of
  too noble a nature to free himself by a bribe. He was not guilty of
  any crime, and he would not stoop to commit a wrong in order to gain
  freedom. Furthermore', he was himself too poor to pay such a ransom,
  had he been disposed to• do so, and he would not, in his own behalf, i
  appeal to the sympathy and generosity of his converts."—"The Acts
  of the Apostles," pp. 426, 427.
      17. What is the last word concerning Felix? Verse 27.
      NovE.—The inspired record leaves Felix in his baseness, doing in-
  justice to Paul to please the Jews. There had been an outbreak be-
                                '    [25 ]
tween the Jews and the Gentiles in Cmsarea; and on accusation of the
Jews, Felix had been called to account by Nero, at Rome. He was par-
doned, however, but apparently never achieved distinction again, and
he had turned from life eternal. It is the opinion of historians that
Drusilla and her son by Felix perished in the great eruption of Vesu-
vius, in A. D. 79. One of those shapeless human forms dug out of the
ashes and lava beds of Pompeii in recent years may represent the
wicked but beautiful princess who listened to Paul's sermon that day
in Cmsarea, calling in vain to repentance before the judgment to come.
                         PERSONAL REFLECTIONS
    Am I, in my daily life, saying yes to the Holy Spirit, as did the
Philippian jailer (Acts 16: 25-31) ; or, am I saying no, as did Felix?
    Am I ready to avoid all wrong methods to secure advantage
    There is danger in delay. The "convenient season" may never come
to those who put off salvation.


                                LESSON 9
                    PAUL BEFORE FESTUS ,
                               May 28, 1927
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Acts 25.
MEMORY VERSE: "If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are
   ye." 1 Peter 4: 14.
LESSON HELP: "The Acts of the Apostles," pp. 428-435.

                        SETTING OF THE LESSON
   Felix, desiring to please the Jews, kept Paul in prison, but granted
him many favors. Two years passed away, and Porcius Festus was ap-
pointed governor in the place of Felix. That Paul's enemies had not
forgotten him, but were simply waiting for a favorable time to renew
their efforts to have him put to death, is evident from the scriptures
considered in this lesson.

                                    THE LESSON
   1. Who succeeded Felix as governor of Judea? Acts 24: 27.
                                     [ 26 ]
   NomE.--Porcius Festus was appointed governor of Judea by Nero,
A. D. 60. Josephus tells us that he governed his stormy province with
a wise and firm rule. His firmness in resisting the unjust demands of
the Jews must elicit our admiration.
    2. Where did Festus first go after assuming the duties of his of-
fice? What further effort against Paul was made by the Jews at
Jerusalem? Acts 23: 1, 2.                             .    •
    NOTE.—That the Jews were so quick to approach Festus, after
waiting two years, shows that the spread of the Christian teaching
kept irritating them, and also that Paul was considered a leader of the
new movement.
   3. What did the Jews ask Festus to do? Verse 3.
   NOTE.—They poured' into the ears of the new governor all the
charges Tertullus had brought against Paul, and begged Festus to
have Paul brought to Jerusalem for trial since the accusations against
him were chiefly for breaking the Jewish law. They purposed to
assassinate Paul while he was on the way from Ceesarea to Jerusalem,
somewhat after their plan of two years before, IAA now with much
better chance of success.
  . 4. What was the reply of Festus? What better plan did he pro-
pose? Verses 4, 5.
    NOTE.—"Festus held firmly to his purpose of giving Paul a fair
trial at Ceesarea. God in His providence controlled the decision of
Festus, that the life of the apostle might be lengthened."—"The Acts
of the Apostles," p. 429.
     The unprejudiced Roman governor was, more susceptible to the
influence of God's Spirit than the Jewish priests who had year after
year been rejecting light and instruction.
   5. On being arraigned before the court of Festus at Ceasarea, what •
accusations were laid against Paul? Verses 6, 7.
    6. How did Paul briefly reply to these false charges? Verse 8.
    7. What question, pleasing to the Jews, did Festus ask Paul?
Verse 9.
    NomE.—"Governor Festus summoned Paul into court where they
emphasized these 'many and grievous complaints,' and asked Paul if he
were willing to go up to Jerusalem for his trial. The question was
whether Paul would accept an informal acquittal from the Roman
court on condition that he submit to a trial before his own people on
the other counts, which would naturally come before the Sanhedrin.
Thus Festus would throw upon Paul the responsibility of refusing to
go to Jerusalem. 'As far as he was concerned, the Jewish notables
would be able to see that no obstacles were thrown by him in the way
of their carrying out their customs and rights.'"—Peloubet.
   8. What noble reply and appeal did Paul den make? Verses 10, 11.
    NomE.—Paul stood up "foursquare to all the winds that blow" for
his rights as as-Roman citizen. His independent manhood speaks out,
"I deny their charges; I will not go to Jerusalem to be tried by my
                                 [ 27 ]
 enemies; I appeal unto Cusar." This appeal was Paul's only safety.
 "He no doubt saw in this appeal an opportunity of accomplishing his
 long-cherished desire of going to Rome (Acts 19:21) and realizing the
 Lord's promise to him that he should preach the gospel there (Acts
23:11). 'We can but suppose that a sudden inspiration opened his eyes
 to the path by which he might be carried to the long-desired goal of
 his hopes at Rome.' "—McGiffert.
     9. What was governor's official reply? Verse 12.1
     10. Who now paid a friendly visit to Festus?. Verse 13.
     NoTE.-*—Agrippa II was the great grandson of Herod the Great,
 who ordered the massacre of the children in his effort to destroy the
 newborn King of the Jews. Matt. 2:16-18. He was son of Herod
 Agrippa I, who put James to death, and who was smitten by the Lord
 in this same city of Cmsarea. Acts 12:1, 2, 21-23.
     11. How did Festus introduce Paul's case to Bing Agrippa?
 Verses 14-17.
     12. What did he say of the character of the charges against Paul?
Verses 18, 19.
     13. What had he asked Paul? What was the outcome of the trial?
Verses 20, 21.
     14. What desire was expressed by King Agrippa? What reply did
Festus make? Verse 22. •
     15. What is said of the circumstances under which Paul witnessed
for Christ before Agrippa? Verse 23.
     NOTE.—The court assembled in the same magnificent hall of the
palace which had witnessed the still more stately scene, eighteen years
before, when the father of Agrippa was called a god, and came to his
tragic death because of his pride.
     16. How did Festus introduce Paul's case to Agrippa and those
present? Verses 24, 25.
    17. What peculiar embarrassment was Festus under in the matter
of sending Paul to Cmsar's court? Verses 26, 27.
    NOTE.—"Festus was puzzled to know what charges to send with
Paul to Rome. For Paul was no such criminal as the Jews tried to
make him out. He had broken no Roman law. And yet Festus could
not send a prisoner to Rome without stating why he was a prisoner,
and why he was sent. Hence he asked Agrippa, who was a Jew, to
help him out of this dilemma."—Peloubet.
                     PERSONAL REFLECTIONS
    "Though- an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not
fear." "For in the time of trouble He shall hide me in His pavilion:
in the secret of His tabernacle shall He hide me." Ps-alm 27: 3, 5.
    How much depends upon the answer to the question which seemed
so trivial to the governor! Acts 25: 9.
    Why was Paul so well prepared to meet unexpected situations in
his experience'
                                  28

                    PAUL BEFORE AGRIPPA
                              • June 4, 1927
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Acts 26.
MEMORY VERSE: "Behold, now is the -accepted time; behold, now is                the
   day of salvation." 2 Corinthians 6: 2. .

                        SETTING OF THE LESSON
    King Agrippa and Bernice, visiting Festus, learned of Paul and.,
the accusations of the Jews against him. Agrippa expressed a desire
to see Paul and to hear him speak, and Festus arranged for such a
meeting.
                        Suggestions for Daily Family Study

                                 THE LESSON            '
   1. Who assembled in the judgment hall at Cmsarea to hear Paul
speak? Acts 25: 23.
    2. When the preliminaries of the public hearing were over, what
did Agrippa say to Paul? How did Paul arrest the attention of his.
audience? Acts 26: 1.
    NOTE.—Not as a guilty criminal cringing before the judge, but
as a witness and pleader for a great cause, the apostle stood before
the assembly. His hand, though possibly the one from which a chain
was hanging, was stretched forth in gesture to command attention,
after the manner of the practiced orator.
    3. In what respectful words did Paul begin his speech? What
gave him special satisfaction in speaking before Agrippa? Verses
2, 3.
    NOTE.—Paul appealed to the one good point in Agrippa's bad
chUracter and life, not only because it was a courteous and fitting thing
to do, but because it was the only way to open Agrippa's heart to the
gospel. Agrippa, being a Jew, could understand Paul's argument
better than Festus, for he was acquainted with the Scriptures, and the
customs of the Jews. Paul had been condemned for preaching that
the Messiah, for whom the Jews were looking, had come.
                                       [ 29
   4. What did the Jews know concerning Paul's life? Verses 4, 5.
    5. For what did he say he was now being judged? Verses 6, 7.
    NOTE.—"He showed how thel Old Testament Scriptures had de-
clared that the Messiah was to appear as a man .among men; and how
in the life of Jesus had been fulfilled every specification outlined by
Moses and the prophets. For the purpose of redeeming a lost world,
the divine Son of God had endured the cross, despising the shame, and
had ascended to heaven triumphant over death and the grave."—"The
Acts of the Apostles," p. 436.
    6. What appeal did he make to the king, touching the hope for
which he was on trial and in bonds? Verse 8.
    NOTE.—The fulfillment of the hope of Israel was dependent upon
the resurrection. Abraham and all the faithful were dead, yet God
had promised an everlasting inheritance to them.
    7. What did Paul say of his former zeal in the Jews' religion?
Verses 9-11.
    8. How does he, for the third time, relate the experience of his re-
markable conversion? Verses 12-16.
    9. What commission does he say he received at that time? Verses
17, 18.
    10. How does he say he responded to the heavenly vision? Verses
19, 20.
    NoTE.—Paul's strongest argument was that he was not disobedient
to the heavenly vision, but he preached what he believed, and gave his
entire life, amid perils, in hunger and thirst, cold and nakedness, per-
secutions, "stripes above measure," and shipwrecks (2 Cor. 11: 23-25),
to urging Jews and Gentiles 10. "repent and turn to God, and do works
meet for repentance" as he had done.
    11. Because of these things, what had the Jews attempted to do?
Verse 21.
    NoTE.—The charges against Paul were evidently false, for the
Jews went about to kill him because he proclaimed the very Messiah
they were expecting, the One who would be the fulfillment of their
hopes.
    12. Who had helped the apostle thus far to witness for Jesus?
What were the main points in his teaching? Verses 22, 23.
    13. What interruption bore witness to Paul's earnestness in speak-
ing? Verse 24.
    NoTE.--"The whole company had listened spellbound to Paul's
account of his wonderful experiences. The apostle was dwelling upon
his favorite theme. None who heard him could doubt his sincerity.
But in the full tide of his persuasive eloquence he was interrupted by
Festus, who cried out, 'Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning
doth make thee mad.' "—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 437.
                                 [30 1
   14. What was Paul's reply? Verse 25.
   15. What did Paul say that King Agrippa knew? Verse 26.
   16. What personal question did Paul put to the Jewish king? As
he apparently saw the king deeply moved, what did 'he declare?
Verse 27.
   Now.—As Paul made the appeal direct, to the wicked king, it is
plainly apparent that it was Agrippa, and not Paul, who was on trial
that day.
    17. What conviction was expressed by the king? Verse 28.
    NOTE.—"Deeply affected, Agrippa for the moment lost sight of his
surroundings and the dignity of his position. Conscious only of the
truths which he had heard, seeing only the humble prisoner standing
before him as God's ambassador, he answered involuntarily, 'Almost
thou persuadest me to be a Christian.' . . .
    "Festus, Agrippa, and Bernice might in justice have worn the
fetters that bound the apostle. All were guilty of grievous orimes.
These offenders had that day heard the offer of salvation through the
name of Christ. One, at least, had been almost persifided to accept the
grace and pardon offered. But Agrippa put aside the proffered mercy,
refusing to accept the cross of a crucified Redeemer."—"Tlie Acts of
the Apostles," p. 438.
   18. What heartfelt desire did Paul express in response to Agrippa's
declaration? By what act did the king show that he did not desire to
hear more of Paul's words? Verses 29, 30.
    19. What did the king and those with him say after conferring to-
gether? What did Agrippa say to Festus? Verses 31, 32.
    NoTE.—"The court decided that Paul was innocent, and might have
been set at liberty had he not appealed to Cmsar ; but that the appeal
must stand. The whole process of two years and more, at Jerusalem
and Caesarea, ended in a public and decisive acquittal. Claudius
Lysias, Festus, and Agrippa had each declared him innocent; three
times was it publicly announced of the apostle, as of the Lord, that
he had done nothing worthy of death. But this decision was the means
of bringing him safely to Rome. It made a favorable impression on
the Roman officer who took him there, and upon the Roman authori-
ties after his-arrival."—Peloubet.
                         PERSONAL REFLECTIONS
     It is a fearful thing to trifle with conscience, especially when con-
science is stirred by the Holy Spirit, as was the case with King
Agrippa.
    As the apostolic preaching was a witness to fulfilling prophecy in
that generation, so now the gospel carries a message of prophecy ful-
filling in our own generation. Acts 26: 22, 23; Rev. 14: 6-12.
     What is the hope for which we stand before the world, even as
Paul stood?                                          •
     What five things does the. Lord wish to do for us all? Acts 26: 18.

                                 THE LESSON
    1. What was now determined in Paul's case? What Roman ofECer
had charge of Paul when he started on his voyage to Rome? Who of
the same faith accompanied Paul? Acts 27: 1, 2.
    NOTE.—"One circumstance greatly lightened the hardship of his
lot,—he was permitted the companionship of Luke and Aristarchus.
In his letter to the Colossians, he afterwards referred to the latter as
his 'fellow prisoner' (Col. 4:10) ; but it was from choice that Aristar-
chiis shared Paul's bondage, that he might minister to him in his
afflictions."—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 440.
    Aristarchus had passed through some stirring experiences before
this, in his service with the apostle. Acts 19: 28, 29.               •
    2. Trace the voyage from Cmsarea to Myra. What privilege was.
given Paul at Sidon? At what port did they change ships? Verses
3-6.
    NOTE.—The voyagers for Rome left the ship at Myra, at which
port frequent wheat-laden ships from Egypt arrived en route for
Rome. "The second ship was a large Egyptian merchantman loaded
with grain from Alexandria, having on board two hundred and seventy-
six persons, besides the freight."—Peloubet.
    3. How does Luke describe the voyage to the next port? Verses
7, 8.
                                       [ 33
      YYlldl, We:till/11g itt;l11111.pirillittl raulA ala v       111J11/
Fair Havens? Verses 9, 10.
    NOTE.—"At Fair Havens they were compelled to remain for some
time, waiting for favoring winds. Winter was approaching rapidly;
`sailing was now dangerous;' and those in charge of the vessel had to
give up hope of reaching their destination before the season for travel
by sea should be closed for the year. The only question now to be
decided was, whether to remain at Fair Havens, or attempt to reach a
more favorable place in which to winter.
    "This question was earnestly discussed, and was finally referred by
the centurion to Paul, who had won the respect of both sailors and
soldiers. The apostle unhesitatingly advised remaining where they
were. . . . But 'the master and the owner of the ship,' and the
majority of passengers and crew, were unwilling to accept this coun-
sel."—"The Acts of the Apostles," pp. 440, 441.
    5. How was Paul's counsel overruled? Verses 11, 12.
    6. What favorable omen led them to continue the voyage? What
overtook them soon after they started? Verses 13, 14.
    NOTE.—Euroelydon is from two Greek words which mean "east
wind" and "wave." It means a tempestuous wind at sea.
    7. How does Luke describe the course and handling of the ship in
the tempest? Verses 15-17.
    NoTE.—The hurricane was so great the ship could not be managed,
so it was driven before the wind. The ship's small boat had been in
tow behind, but now with great difficulty they hoisted it aboard. There
was great danger of the ship's timbers springing apart, thus letting in
water, so ropes were passed around the ship and drawn taut.
    8. What further efforts were made to keep the ship from going
down? What did Paul and his companions unite with the sailors in
doing the third day? Verses 18, 19.
    9. What caused the people on board to give up hope of being saved?
Verse 20.
    NOTE.—The ancient mariners were ignorant of the use of the com-
pass, but directed their course largely by the position of the heavenly
bodies. When they could not see the sun or the stars for so long a
time, they lost hope.
    10. In their darkest hour, what cheering message came to the ship's
company through the servant of the Lord? Verses 21, 22.
    NOTE.—Now Paul comes to the front, the only one- in the whole
ship's company who could bring a message of hope. He begins with a
gentle reminder that his advice had not been heeded. This was a good
reason why they should trust him now. Then he promises them safety.
Paul, "the prisoner of Jesus Christ," stood among them as a star of
hope in the dark heavens, as a lighthouse on a stormy, rockbound coast.
    11. Upon what assurance was Paul's message of hope based?
Verses 23, 24.
    NOTE.—The message was that he would be saved because he must
be brought before Caesar, as God had promised him before. Acts 23:
11. Paul's safety was as sure as God's promise.
                                         [ 34 ]
the outcome of the voyage? Verses 25, 26.
   13. How long had the voyage lasted when sight of land appeared?
What did the sailors do to safeguard the ship? For what did they
long? Verses 27-29.
   14, What selfish plan did the sailors form? How was their purpose
frustrated? Verses 30-32.
   15. What counsel and assurance did Paul give the ship's company?
Verses 33-36.
    16. How many were in the ship? After partaking of food, what
was next done? Verses 37, 38.
    17. What was seen as day broke? What plan was formed? What
did the seamen do? Verses 39, 40.
    18. As the ship was about to go to pieces, what counsel was given
by the soldiers? How did the presence of one godly man save the lives
of many others? Verses 41-43.
    NoTE.—The proposition was not a strange one. The 'Roman sol-
dier must forfeit his life if a prisoner intrusted to him escaped.
    19. How did those who could not swim get ashore? What came to
pass in fulfillment of the angel's word to Paul? Verse 44.
    NOTE.—When the roll was called, not one was missing. Nearly
three hundred souls,—sailors, soldiers, passengers, prisoners,—stood
that stormy morning upon the shore of the island of Melita.
                       PERSONAL REFLECTIONS ,
    There is but one true port to which we should steer across the ocean
of ,life. It is the city of God. Only Jesus is wise enough and strong
enough to pilot us safely into the harbor of everlasting rest and safety.

                                  THE LESSON
   1. What-was the name of the island on which Paul and the ship's
company had been cast? Acts 28: 1.
    NOTE.—The modern name is-Malta, now a British naval station.
It is sixty miles from the island of Sicily, and two hundred from the
African coast. A bay on the north side 'of the island has been named
St. Paul's Bay, where it is supposed the party landed.
    2. What kindness was shown the shipwrecked. crew and passengers
by the people of the; island? Verse 2.
    NOTE.—To the Greeks, all were "barbarians" who did not speak
Greek. The people were of Phoenician origin. It was probably late
in October, and already the chill nights and mornings of autumn had
begun. The kindness shown by the islanders was repaid in blessings
later.
    3. What service did Paul render? Verse 3.
    NOTE.—Paul "was ready to do the humblest duty. He knew the
greatness of serving. His Master had taught this duty and privilege
when He washed His disciples' feet. 'Whatever was to be done, if he,
were able to take a part in it, he was never wanting, whether it was
in counseling about a difficulty, in comforting under danger, or help-
ing by bodily labor to relieve the general distress.' "—Peloubet.
    Heroic deeds are no more praiseworthy than the commonest daily
toil done with the same high motive of love to God and man.
   4. What change in the attitude of the people of the island was
caused by Paul's experience with the viper? Verses 4-6.
   NOTE.—"One writer on this verse says that no poisonous serpent
ever fastens itself to what it strikes with its fangs. I went to a
naturalist and he tells me that the, writer is mistaken; and he showed
me 'The Reptile Book' by Raymond Lee Ditmars, curator of reptiles in
the New Fork City Zoological Park (1907), who says the viperine
snakes `do not strike and then await the death of .the animal from
poison, . . . but once seizing the animal retain their hold With fangs
deeply embedded until its struggles have ceased.' "—Peloubet.
   5. Who had quarters in this part of the island? What did he do?
What blessing came to the hospitable Publius? Verses 7, 8.
   6. What followed this,manifestation of God's power? How did
the islanders generally treat the party? Verses 9, 10.
                                     [36 ]
    7. After remaining at Melita (modern Malta) three months, by
what means and course did they journey to Italy? Verses 11-13.
    NoTE.—The sign of the ship on which Paul sailed was really its
name. Such signs were used because many could not read. Castor and
Pollux were supposed to be twin sons of Jupiter.
    November, December, and January evidently had been spent in
Malta, and with early February, the Alexandrian grain ships were
again moving toward Italy. Syracuse was the great port of Sicily;
and at Rhegium, at the toe of the Italian boot, the apostle first touched
Italy. The company landed at Puteoli, on the present Bay of Naples.
    8. Where was Paul permitted to tarry with friends? Verse 14.
    9. Who came to meet him at Appii Forum? How did this meeting
with the brethren from Rome affect the apostle? Verse 15.
    NOTE.—"From Puteoli they marched thirty-three miles before they
reached the famous Appian Way, the great military road from Rome
to Southern Italy, 'by which many a Roman general had passed in tri-
umph to the capitol, seated on a car of victory, surrounded by the
plaudits of rejoicing Rome.' . . . Fifty-seven miles farther along this
road they came to Appii Forum."—Peloubet. Here they were met by
the first delegation of brethren from Rome.
    "At last the travelers reach Appii Forum, forty miles from Rome.
As they make their way through the crowds that throng the great
thoroughfare, the gray-haired old man, chained with a group of hard-
ened-looking criminals, receives many a glance of scorn, and is made
the subject of many a rude, mocking jest.
    "Suddenly a cry of joy is heard, and a man springs from the pass-
ing throng and falls upon the prisoner's neck, embracing him with
tears and rejoicing, as a son would welcome a long-absent father.
Again and again is the scene repeated, as, with eyes made keen by
loving expectation, many discern in the chained captive the one who at
Corinth, at Philippi, at Ephesus, had spoken to them the words of life.
    "As the warm-hearted disciples eagerly flock around their father
in the gospel, the whole company is brought to a standstill. The sol-
diers are impatient of delay, yet they have not the heart to interrupt
this happy meeting; for they too have learned to respect and esteem
their prisoner."—"The Acts of the Apostles," pp. 448, 449.
    10. When delivered by Julius to the Roman guard, how was Paul
treated differently from other prisoners? Verse 16.
    11. How soon after reaching Rome did Paul call a meeting of the
leading Jews at Rome? What are the main points in his talk to the
brethren at Rome? Verses 17-20.
    NOTE.—"Many of the Jews who had been banished from Rome
some years previously had been allowed to return, so that large num-
 bers were now to be found there. To these, first of all, Paul deter-
mined to present the facts concerning himself and his work, before his
enemies should have opportunity to embitter them against him."—
"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 450.
    12. What inforMation concerning Paul's case had these Jews failed
to receive? What reason did they give for desiring to hear his mes-
sage? Verses 21, 22.
                                   [ 37 1
     13. How did the apostle take advantage of this opening? What two
classes of hearers were there? Verses 23, 24.
     14. 'What is said of those wIn rejected the message? To what pro-
phetic warning did Paul direct their attention? Verses 25-27.
     15. What solemn declaration did the apostle make? Verse 28.
     16. What was the effect of these words? Verse 29.
     17. How long and under what conditions did Paul, the prisoner,
live at Rome? Verses 30, 31.
     NOTE.—"Paul was treated in Rome with the utmost leniency. He
was allowed to hire a house or a lodging in the city and live there at
his own convenience under the surveillance of a soldier who was re-
sponsible for his presence when required. A light chain fastened
Paul's wrist to that of the soldier. No hindrance was offered to his
inviting friends into his house, or to his preaching to all who came in
to him ; but he was not allowed to go out freely."—Ramsay.             -
     Paul's first trial before Nero was delayed these two years by the
failure of his accusers to present themselves.
     "In the providence of God, this delay resulted in the furtherance
of the gospel. . . . During this time, the churches that he had estab-
lished in many lands were not forgotten. Realizing the dangers that
threatened the converts to the new faith, the apostle sought so far as
possible to meet their needs by letters of warning and practical instruc-
tion. And from Rome he sent out consecrated workers to labor not
only for these churches, but in fields that he himself had not visited.
. . . Thus, while apparently cut off from active labor, Paul exerted a
wider and more lasting influence than if he had been free to travel
among the churches as in former years."—"The Acts of the Apostles,"
pp. 453, 454.
     18. What promise was thus fulfilled to Paul? Acts 23:11; 27:24.
     NomE.—Paul spent two busy years in his own hired house preaching
the gospel and writing letters to the churches. The epistles of Phile-
mon, Colossians, Ephesians, and Philippians were written during his
first captivity at Rome.
     The chronology of events in these years, as nearly as students have
worked it out, is as follows:
         Paul's arrival in Rome                        A. D. 61
         Trial and acquittal                           A. D. 63
         Burning of Rome                               A. D. 64
         Paul's condemnation and martyrdom             A. D. 68,
    During the visit to Greece and Macedonia and Asia, the apostle
wrote the epistle to Titus and the first to Timothy; the second epistle
to Timothy, so full of courage and trust, his last message to the church,
being written in Rome after his condemnation. It is supposed that
Paul must have been executed in May or June, A. D. 68.
    Of Paul's last moments we read: "As he stands at the place of
martyrdom, he sees not the sword of the executioner or the earth so
soon to receive his blood; he looks up through the calm blue heaven of
that summer day to the throne of the Eternal. . . . His faith is
                                 [ 38 ]
strengthened as he calls to mind how patriarchs and prophets have re-
lied upon the One who is his support and consolation. . . . From the
rack, the stake, the dungeon, from dens and caves of the earth, there
falls upon his ear the martyr's shout of triumph.. . . His mind grasps
the Saviour's promise, 'I will raise him up at the last day.' His
thoughts and hopes are centered on the second coming of his Lord.
And as the sword of the executioner descends, and the shadows of
death gather about the martyr, his latest thought springs forward, as
will his earliest in the great awakening, to meet the 'Life-giver, who
shall welcome him to the joy of the blest."—"The Acts of the Apos-
tles," pp. 511-513.
                       PERSONAL REFLECTIONS                            •
     As the apostolic church carried the gospel to all the world in their
day, so a commission is given the church to-day. What is this com-
mission?
     Whether temporarily or permanently settled in a place, every place
 is a mission field.
 - 'Wherever the child of God may be, he is under,the care of his ever-
present Saviour.
