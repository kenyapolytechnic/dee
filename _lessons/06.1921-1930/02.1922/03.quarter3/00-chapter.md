                             Notes
   1. "Cain and Abel represent two classes that will exist in
the world till the close of time. One class avail themselves
of the appointed sacrifice for sin; the other venture to de-
pend upon their own merits; theirs is a sacrifice without the
virtue of divine mediation, and thus it is not able to bring
man into favor with God. It is only through the merits of
Jesus that our transgressions can be pardoned, . . . The
desk of worshipers who follow the example of Cain includes
by far the greater portion of, the world; for-nearly every
false religion has .been based on the same principle,— that
man can depend upon his own efforts for salvation. It is
claimed by some that the human race is in need, not of re-
demption, but of development,— that it can refine, elevate,
and regenerate itself. As Cain thought to secure the di-
vine favor by an offering that lacked the blood of a sacrifice,
so do these expect to exalt humanity to the divine standard,
independent of the atonement. The history of Cain shows
what must be the result. It shows what man will become
apart from Christ. Humanity has no power to regenerate
itself. It does not tend upward, toward the divine, but
downward, toward the satanic. Christ is our only hope.
`There is none other name under heaven given among men,
whereby we must be saved.' Neither is there salvation in
any other.'"—"Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 72, 78.
    2. From the fact that offerings were made, we may un-
derstand that specific instruction had been given to the
human race concerning the worship of God. Adam's family
had a- knowledge of sin and of its evil consequences. They
understood their need of a Saviour, and they had been in-,
strutted in the proper way to show their faith in the com-
ing Redeemer.

                            Notes
    1. "Enoch's walk with God was not in a trance or a vis-
ion, but in all the duties of his daily life. He did not be-
come a hermit, shutting himself entirely from the world; for
he had a work to do for God in the world. In the family and
in his intercourse with men, as a husband and father, a
friend, a citizen, he was the steadfast, unwavering servant
of the Lord.
    "His heart was in harmony with God's will; for 'can two
walk together, except they be agreed?' And this holy walk
was continued for three hundred years. There are few
Christians who would not be far more earnest and devoted if
they knew that they had but a short time to live, or that the
coming of Christ was about to take place. But Enoch's
faith waxed the stronger, his love became more ardent, with
the lapse of centuries.
    "Enoch was a man of strong and highly cultivated mind,
and extensive knowledge; he was honored with special reve-
lations from God; yet being in constant communion with
heaven, with a sense of the divine greatness and perfection
ever before him, he was one of the humblest of men. The
closer the connection with God, the deeper was the sense of
his own weakness and imperfection."—"Patriarchs and
Prophets," p. 85.                          •
    2. "They [the antediluvians] possessed great physical
and mental strength, and their advantages for acquiring
both religious and scientific knowledge were unrivaled. It
is a mistake to suppose that because they lived to a great
age their minds matured late; their mental powers were
early developed, and those who cherished the fear of God
and lived in harmony with His will, continued to increase
in knowledge and wisdom throughout their life. Could
illustrious scholars of our 'time be placed in contrast with
men of the same age who lived before the Flood, they would
appear as greatly inferior in mental as in physical strength.
As the years of man have decreased, and his physical
strength has diminished, so his mental capacities have less-
ened. There are men who now apply themselves to study
during a period of from twenty to fifty years, and the world
is filled with admiration of their attainments. But how
limited are these acquirements in comparison with those of
men whose mental and physical powers were developing for
centuries!"— Id., pp. 82, 83.

14. In what country did he sojourn for a time, and for what
       reason? Verse 10. Note 5.
                             Notes
    1. "The call from heaven first came to Abraham while
he dwelt in 'Ur of the Chaldees,' and in obedience to it he re-
moved to Haran. Thus far his father's family accompanied
him; for with their idolatry they united the worship of the
true God. Here Abraham remained till the death of Terah.
But from his father's grave the divine voice bade him go
forward. His brother Nahor with his household clung to
their home and their idols. Besides Sarah, the wife of Abra-
ham, only Lot, the son of Haran long since dead, chose to
share the patriarch's pilgrim life. Yet it was a large
company that set out from Mesopotamia."—"Patriarchs and
Prophets," p. 127.
    2. "Abraham had grown up in the midst of superstition
and heathenism. Even his father's household, by whom the
knowledge of God had been preserved, were yielding to the
seductive influences surrounding them, and they 'served
other gods' than Jehovah. But the true faith was not to be-
come extinct. God has ever preserved a remnant to serve
Him. Adam, Seth, Enoch, Methuselah, Noah, Shem, in un-
broken line, had preserved from age to age the precious re-
vealings of His will. The son of Terah became the inheritor
of this holy trust."— Id., p. 125.
    For "the other side of the flood," the American Revised
Version gives, "beyond the river." This is a better transla-
tion. The river referred to is the Euphrates.
    3. "Idolatry invited him on every side, but in vain.
Faithful among the faithless, uncorrupted by the prevailing
apostasy, he steadfastly adhered to the worship of the one
true God. 'The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon
Him, to all that call upon Him in truth.' He communicated
His will to Abraham, and gave him a distinct knowledge of
the requirements of His law, and of the salvation that would
be accomplished through Christ."— Ibid.
    4. "In order that God might qualify him for his great
work, as the keeper of the sacred oracles, Abraham must be
separated from the associations of his early life. The in-
fluence of kindred and friends would interfere with the train-
ing which the Lord purposed to give His servant. Now that
Abraham was, in a special sense, connected with heaven, he
must dwell among strangers. His character must be
peculiar, differing from all the world."— Id., p. 126.
    5. "The Lord in His providence had brougt this trial upon
Abraham to teach him lessons of submission, patience, and
faith,— lessons that were to be placed on record for the
benefit of all who should afterward be called to endure elk-

tion. God leads His children by a way that they know not;
but He does not forget or cast off those who put their trust
in Him."- Id., p. 129.

       Note 4.
                           Notes
    1. "Here the noble, unselfish spirit of Abraham was dis-
played. How many, under similar circumstances, would, at
all hazards, cling to their individual rights and preferences!
How many households have thus been rent asunder! How
many churches have been divided, making the cause of truth
a byword and a reproach among the wicked! 'Let there be
no strife between me and thee,' said Abraham, 'for we be
brethren;' not only by natural relationship, but as worshipers
of the true God. The children of God, the world over, are one
family, and the same spirit of love and conciliation should
govern them. 'Be kindly affectioned one to another with
brotherly love; in honor preferring one another,' is the teach-
ing of our Saviour. The cultivation of a uniform courtesy, a
willingness to do to others as we would wish them to do to us,
would annihilate half the ills of life. The spirit of self-
aggrandizement is the spirit of Satan; but the heart in which
the love of Christ is cherished, will possess that charity which
seeketh not her own. Such will heed the divine injunction,
`Look not every man on his own things, but every man also
on the things of others.' "—"Patriarchs and Prophets," pp.
132, 133.
    2. "Although Lot owed his prosperity to his connection
with Abraham, he manifested no gratitude to his benefactor.
Courtesy would have dictated that he yield the choice to
Abraham; but instead of this, he selfishly endeavored to grasp
all its advantages. . . . The most fertile region in all Pales-
tine was the Jordan valley,. reminding the beholders of the
lost Paradise, and equaling the beauty and productiveness of
the Nile-enriched plains they had so lately left. There were
cities also, wealthy and beautiful, inviting to profitable traffic
in their crowded marts. Dazzled with visions of worldly gain,
Lot overlooked the moral and spiritual evils that would be
encountered there. The inhabitants of the plain were 'sinners
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     11

before the Lord exceedingly;' but of this he was ignorant, or,
knowing, gave it but little weight. He 'chose him all the
plain of Jordan,' and 'pitched his tent toward Sodom.' How
little did he foresee the terrible results of that selfish choice!"
—Id., p. 133.
     3. "The fulfillment of God's promise may seem to be long
delayed — for 'one day is with the Lord as a thousand years,
and a thousand years as one day;' it may appear to tarry;
but at the appointed time 'it will surely come, it will not
tarry.' The gift to Abraham and his seed included not merely
the land of Canaan, but the whole earth. So says the apostle,
`The promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was
not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through
the righteousness of faith.' And the Bible plainly teaches
that the promises made to Abraham are to be fulfilled through
Christ. . . .
     "Of the posterity of Abraham it is written, 'These all
died in faith, not having received the promises, but having
seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and em-
braced them, and confessed that they were strangers and
pilgrims on the earth.' We must dwell as pilgrims and
strangers here if we would gain 'a better country, that is, a
heavenly.' Those who are children of Abraham will be seek-
ing the city which he looked for, 'whose builder and maker
is God.' "— Id., p. 170.
     4. "On his return, the king of Sodom came out with his
retinue to honor the conqueror. He bade him take the goods,
begging only that the prisoners should be restored. By the
usage of war, the spoils belonged to the conquerors; but
Abraham had undertaken this expedition with no purpose
of gain, and he refused to take advantage of the unfortunate,
only stipulating that his confederates should receive the
portion to which they were entitled.
     "Few, if subjected to such a test, would have shown them-
selves as noble as did Abraham. Few would have resisted
the temptation to secure so rich a booty. His example is a
rebuke to self-seeking, mercenary spirits.        Id., pp. 135, 136.

                              Notes
    1. After the battle with the kings, "Abraham gladly re-
turned to his tents and his flocks; but his mind was disturbed
by harassing thoughts. He had been a man of peace, so far
as possible shunning enmity and strife; and with horror he
recalled the scene of carnage he had witnessed. But the na-
tions whose forces he had defeated would doubtless renew
the invasion of Canaan, and make him the special object of
their vengeance. Becoming thus involved in national guar-
      the peaceful quiet of his life would be broken. Further-
more, he had not entered upon the possession of Canaan, nor
could he now hope for an heir; to whom the promise might be
fulfilled.
    "In a vision of the night the divine voice was again heard.
`Fear not, Abram,' were the words of the Prince of princes;
`I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.' But his
mind was so oppressed by forebodings that he could not now
grasp the promise with unquestioning confidence as hereto-
fore. He prayed for some tangible evidence that it would be
fulfilled. And how was the covenant promise to be realized,
while the gift of a son was withheld? 'What wilt Thou give
me,' he said, 'seeing I go childless?"And, lo, one born in my
house is mine heir.' He proposed to make his trusty servant
Eliezer his son by adoption, and the inheritor of his posses-
sions. But he was assured that a child of his own was to be
his heir."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 136, 137.
    2. "In token of the fulfillment of this covenant, his name,
heretofore called Abram, was changed to Abraham, which
signifies, 'father of a great multitude.' Sarai's name became
Sarah,—`princess;' for,' said the divine voice, 'she shall be
a mother of nations; kings of people shall be of her.' "—Id.,
 pp. 137, 138.
    3. "Abraham had seen in his guests only three tired way-
farers, little thinking that among them was One whom he
 might worship without sin. But the true character of
the heavenly messengers was now revealed. . . . Two of the
heavenly messengers departed, leaving Abraham alone with
 Him whom he now knew to be the Son of God."— Id., pp.
138, 139.
     4. "Love for perishing souls inspired Abraham's prayer.
 While he loathed the sins of that corrupt city, he desired that
 the sinners might be saved. His deep interest for Sodom
14          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

shows the anxiety that we should feel far the impenitent. We
should cherish hatred of sin, but pity and love for the sinner.
All around us are souls going down to ruin as hopeless, as
terrible, as that which befell Sodom. Every day the pro-
bation of some is closing. Every hour some are passing be-
yond the reach of mercy. And where are the voices of warn-
ing and .entreaty to bid the sinner flee from this fearful doom?
Where are the hands stretched out to draw him back from
death? Where are those who with humility and persevering
faith are pleading with God for him? The spirit of Abraham
was the spirit of Christ."- Id., p. 140.

                           Notes
   1. "God had reserved His last, most trying test for Abra-
ham until the burden of years was heavy upon him, and he
longed for rest from anxiety and toil.
    "The patriarch was dwelling at Beersheba, surrounded by
prosperity and honor. He was very rich, and was honored as
a mighty prince by the rulers of the land. Thousands of sheep
and cattle covered the plains that spread out beyond his en-
campment. On every side were the tents of his retainers,
the home of hundreds of faithful servants. The son of prom-
ise'had grown up to manhood by his side. Heaven seemed to
have crowned with its blessing a life of sacrifice in patient
endurance of hope deferred.
    "In the obedience of faith, Abraham had forsaken his na-
tive country,— had turned away from the graves of his
fathers and the home of his kindred. He had wandered as a
stranger in the land of his inheritance. He had waited long
for the birth of the promised heir. At the command of God
he had sent away his son Ishmael. And now, when the child
so long desired was entering upon manhood, and the patriarch
seemed able to discern the fruition of his hopes, a trial
greater than all others was before him."—"Patriarchs and
Prophets," pp. 147, 148.
16          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

    2. "Satan was at hand to suggest that he must be de-
ceived, for the divine law commands, 'Thou shalt not kill,'
and God would not require what He had once forbidden. Go-
ing outside his tent, Abraham looked up to the calm bright-
 ness of the unclouded heavens, and recalled the promise made
 nearly fifty years before, that his seed should be innumerable
as the stars. If this promise was.to be fulfilled through Isaac,
 how could he be put to death? Abraham was tempted to be-
lieve that he might be under a delusion. In his doubt and
anguish he bowed upon the earth, and prayed, as he had
never prayed before, for some confirmation of the command
if he must perform this terrible duty. . . . Darkness seemed
to shut him in; 'but the command of God was sounding in
his ears, 'Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou
lovest.' That command must be obeyed, and he dared not
delay. Day was approaching, and he must be on his journey."
— Id., p. 148.
    3. Note the faith implied in Abraham's answer, "I and
the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you."
Though preparing to offer Isaac as a sacrifice, he expected
to bring him back with him. He accounted that God was able
to raise him. from the dead (Heb. 11: 19) and thus through
the resurrection fulfill the promise.
    4. "With trembling voice, Abraham unfolded to his son
the divine message. It was with terror and amazement that
Isaac learned his fate; but he offered no resistance. He could
have escaped his doom, had he chosen to do so; the grief-
stricken old man, exhausted with the struggle of those three
terrible days, could not have opposed the will of the vigorous
youth. But Isaac had been trained from childhood to ready,
trusting obedience, and as the purpose of God was opened be-
fore him, he yielded a willing submission. He was a sharer in
Abraham's faith, and he felt that he was honored in being
called to give his life as an offering to God. He tenderly seeks
to lighten the father's grief, and encourages his nerveless
hands to bind the cords that confine him to the altar."— /d.,
p. 152.
    5. "Abraham's great act of faith stands like a pillar of
light, illuminating the pathway of God's servants in all suc-
ceeding ages. Abraham did not seek to excuse himself from
doing the will of God. During that three days' journey he
had sufficient time to reason, and to doubt God, if he was dis-
posed to doubt. He might have reasoned that the slaying of
his son would cause him to be looked upon as a murderer, a
second Cain; that it would cause his teaching to be rejected
and despised, and thus destroy his power to do good to his
fellow men. He might have pleaded that age should excuse
him from obedience. But the patriarch did not take refuge in
any of these excuses. Abraham was human; his passions and
           SABBATH. SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  17

attachments were like ours; but he did not stop• to question
how the promise could be fulfilled if Isaac should be slain.
He did not'stay to reason with his aching heart. He knew
that God is just and righteous in all His requirements, and
he obeyed the command to the very letter. 'Abraham be-
lieved God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness.' "

                             Notes
    1. "And now the last night of Sodom was approaching.
Already the clouds of vengeance cast their shadows over the
devoted city. But men perceived it not. While angels drew
near on their mission of destruction, men were dreaming of
prosperity and pleasure. . . . But there was one man who
manifested kindly attention toward the strangers, and in-
vited them to his home. Lot did not know their true character,
but politeness and hospitality were habitual with him; they
were a part of his religion,— lessons that he had learned from
the example of Abraham. Had he not cultivated a spirit of
courtesy, he might have been left to perish with the rest of
Sodom. Many a household, in closing its doors against a
stranger, has shut out God's messenger, who would have
brought blessing and hope and peace."—"Patriarchs and
Prophets," pp. 157, 158.
    2. "The thought of leaving those whom he held dearest on
earth seemed more than he could bear. It was hard to for-
sake his luxurious home, and all the wealth acquired by the
labors of his whole life, to go forth a destitute wanderer.
Stupefied with sorrow, he lingered, loath to depart. But for
the angels of God, they would all have perished in the ruin of
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  19

Sodom. The heavenly messengers took him and his wife and
daughters by the hand, and led them out of the city."— Id.,
p. 160.
    3. "If Lot himself had manifested no hesitancy to obey the
angels' warning, but had earnestly fled toward the mountains,
without one word of pleading or remonstrance, his wife also
would have made her escape. The influence of his example
would have saved her from the sin that sealed her doom."
—Id., p. 161.
    4. "Christ declared, 'As it was in the days of Lot, . .
even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is re-
vealed.' The daily record of passing events testifies to the
fulfillment of His words. The world is fast becoming ripe for
destruction. Soon the judgments of God are to be poured out,
and sin and sinners are to be consumed."— Id., p. 166.
    "You who are slighting the offers of mercy, think of the
long array of figures accumulating against you in the books
of heaven; for there is a record kept of the impieties of na-
tions, of families, of individuals. God may bear long while
the account goes on, and calls to repentance and offers of par-
don may be given; yet a time will come when the account
will be full; when the soul's decision has been made; when by
his own choice, man's destiny has been fixed. Then the signal
will be given for judgment to be executed."—Id., p. 165.
     5. "He gave to the world, not a race of righteous men, but
two idolatrous nations, at enmity with God and warring upon
His people, until, their cup of iniquity being full, they were
appointed to destruction. How terrible were the results that
followed one unwise step !"— /d., p. 168.
     6. "The Lord had called him to leave his idolatrous coun-
trymen, with the promise of the land of Canaan as an ever-
lasting possession • yet neither he nor his son nor his son's
son received it. When Abraham desired a burial place for
his dead, he had to buy it of the Canaanites. His sole posses-
sion in the land of promise was that rock-hewn tomb in the
cave of Machpelah. —Id., p. 169.
     "Of the posterity of Abraham it is written, 'These all died
in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen
 them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced
 them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims
on the earth.' We must dwell as pilgrims and strangers
 here if we would gain 'a better country, that is, a heavenly.'
 Those who are children of Abraham will be seeking the city
which he looked for, 'whose builder and maker is God.' "—
 Id., p. 170.

    The weekly goal for missions is thirty cents a church mem-
ber, through the Sabbath school. No one thought of setting
this standard for foreign fields, but some of them reached it.

                             Notes
   1. "The inhabitants of Canaan were given to idolatry,
and God had forbidden intermarriage between His people and
them, knowing that such marriages would lead to apostasy.
The patriarch feared the effect of the corrupting influences
surrounding his son. Abraham's habitual faith in God and
submission to His will were reflected in the character of
Isaac; but the young man's affections were strong, and he
was gentle and yielding in disposition. If united wi h one
who did not fear God, he would be in danger of sacr, icing
principle for the sake of harmony. In the mind of Abraham,
the choice of a wife for his son was a matter of grave im-
portance; he was anxious to have him marry one who would
not lead him from God."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 171.
    2. This instruction forbids all compromising partnerships.
Marriage of believers with unbelievers has ever been a snare
by which Satan has captured many earnest souls who thought
they could win the unbelieving; but in most cases, they have
themselves drifted away from the moorings of faith into
doubt, backsliding, and loss of religion. It was one of Israel's
constant dangers, against which God warned them repeatedly.
"Give not your daughters unto their sons, neither take their
daughters unto your sons, nor seek their peace [by such com-
promise] or their wealth forever." Ezra 9: 12. (See also
Ex. 34: 14-16; Judges 14: 1-4; Neh. 13: 23-27.) Even Solo-
mon fell before the influence of heathen wives. Concerning
 him the inspired Word has left this record: "His wives
turned away his heart after other gods." 1 Kings 11: 4. Na
 Christian can marry an unbeliever, placing himself upon the
enemy's ground, without running serious risk. The Scriptures
 do not advocate separation after the union has been formed.
1 Cor. 7: 10-16. Good sense should teach us that faith can
 best be maintained, and domestic happiness best insured,
where both husband and wife are believers, and of the same
22         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

faith. Both ministers and parents should warn the young
against improper marriages.
    3. "Abraham had marked the result of the intermarriage
of those who feared God and those who feared Him not, from
the days of Cain to his own time. The consequences of his
own marriage with Hagar, and of the marriage connections of
Ishmael and Lot, were before him. The lack of faith on the
part of Abraham and Sarah, had resulted in the birth of
Ishmael, the mingling of the righteous seed with the ungodly.
The father's influence upon his son was counteracted by that
of the mother's idolatrous kindred, and by Ishmael's connec-
tion with heathen wives. The jealousy of Hagar, and of the
wives whom she chose for Ishmael, surrounded his family
with a barrier that Abraham endeavored in vain to overcome."
—Id., pp. 173, 174.
    "The patriarch's thoughts turned to his father's kindred
in the land of Mesopotamia. Though not free from idolatry,
they cherished the knowledge and the worship of the true God.
Isaac must not leave Canaan to go to them; but it might be
that among them could be found one who would leave her
home, and unite with him in maintaining the pure worship of
the living God."— Id., pp. 171, 172.
    4. "It was a time of anxious thought with him. Impor-
tant results, not only to his master's household but to future
generations, might follow from the choice he made; and how
was he to choose wisely among entire strangers? Remember-
ing the words of Abraham, that God would send His angel
with him, he prayed earnestly for positive guidance. In the
family of his master he was accustomed to the constant ex-
ercise of kindness and hospitality, and he now asked that an
act of courtesy might indicate the maiden whom God had
chosen."— Id., p. 172.
    5. "Isaac was highly honored by God, in being made in-
heritor of the promises through which the world was to be
blessed; yet when he was forty years of age, he submitted to
his father's judgment in appointing his experienced, God-
fearing servant to choose a wife for him. And the result of
that marriage, as presented in the Scriptures, is a tender and
beautiful picture of domestic happiness. . . . What a con-
trast between the course of Isaac and that pursued by the
youth of our time, even among professed Christians! Young
people too often feel that the bestowal of their affections is
a matter in which self alone should be consulted,— a matter
that neither God nor their parents should in any wise control.
Long before they have reached manhood or womanhood, they
think themselves competent to make their own choice,
without the aid of their parents. A few years of married
life are usually sufficient to show them their error, but often
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY               23
too late to prevent its baleful results. . . . Fathers and
mothers should feel that a duty devolves upon them to guide
the affections of the youth, that they may be placed upon
those who will be suitable companions."- Id., pp. 175, 176.

                             Notes
    1. "Esau grew up loving self-gratification, and center-
ing all his interest in the present. Impatient of restraint,
he delighted in the wild freedom of the chase, and early chose
the life of a hunter. Yet he was the father's favorite. The
quiet, peace-loving shepherd was attracted by the daring and
vigor of this elder son, who fearlessly ranged over mountain
and desert, returning home with game for his father, and with
exciting accounts of his adventurous life. Jacob, thoughtful,
diligent, and care-taking, ever thinking more of the future
than the present, was content to dwell at home, occupied in
the care of the flocks and the tillage of the soil. His patient
perseverance, thrift, and foresight were valued by the mother.
His affections were deep and strong, and his gentle, unremit-
ting attentions added far more to her happiness than did the
boisterous and occasional kindnesses of Esau. To Rebekah,
Jacob was the dearer son."—"Patriarchs and Prophets,"
p. 177.
    2. "The promises made to Abraham and confirmed to his
son, were held by Isaac and Rebekah as the great object of
their desires and hopes. With these promises Esau and Jacob
were familiar. They were taught to regard the birthright as
a matter of great importance, for it included not only an
inheritance of worldly wealth, but spiritual preeminence. He
who received it was to be the priest of his family; and in
the line of his posterity the Redeemer of the world would
come. On the other hand, there were obligations resting upon
the possessor of the birthright. He who should inherit its
blessings must devote his life to the service of God. Like
Abraham, he must be obedient to the divine requirements. In
marriage, in his family relations, in ptiblic life, he must -con-
sult the will of God."— Id., pp. 177, 178.
    "The birthright was a spiritual heritage. It gave the
right — which ever belonged to its possessor — of being the
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   25

priest of the family or clan. It carried the privilege of be-
ing the depositary and communicator of the divine secrets.
It constituted a link in the line of descent by which the Mes-
siah was to be born into the world. The right of wielding
power with God and men; the right of catching up and hand-
ing on — as in the old Greek race — the torch of Messianic
hope; the right of heirship to the promises of the covenant
made to Abraham; the right•of standing among the spiritual
aristocracy of mankind; the right of being a pilgrim of
eternity, owning no foot of earth, because all heaven was
held in fee— this, and more than this, was summed up in the
possession of the birthright."— F. B. Meyer.
    3. Profane: "pro," before; and "fane," a temple, or place
of worship. The ground outside the temple inclosure was
considered common and public. The feet of all classes trod
upon it. To Esau, nothing was sacred. He had no love for
devotion, no inclination for a religious life. His mind cen-
tered on self-indulgence, and he desired nothing so much as
liberty to do as he pleased.
    "For a dish of red pottage he parted with his birthright,
and confirmed the transaction by an oath. A short time at
most would have secured him food in his father's tents; but
to satisfy the desire of the moment he carelessly bartered the
glorious heritage that God Himself had promised to his fa-
thers. His whole interest was in the present. He was ready
to sacrifice the heavenly to the earthly, to exchange a fu-
ture good for a momentary indulgence."—"Patriarchs and
Prophets," p. 179.
    4. "Esau had violated one of the conditions of the cove-
nant, which forbade intermarriage between the chosen people
and the heathen; yet Isaac was still unshaken in his deter-
 mination to bestow upon him the birthright. The reasoning
of Rebekah, Jacob's strong desire for the blessing, and Esau's
 indifference to its obligations, had no effect to change the fa-
 ther's purpose."— Ibid.
    5. "He [Esau] represents those who lightly value the re-
 demption purchased for them by Christ, and are ready to
 sacrifice their heirship to heaven for the perishable things of
 earth. Multitudes live for the present, with no thought or
 care for the future. Like Esau they cry, 'Let us eat and
 drink; for to-morrow we die.' They are controlled by inclina-
 tion; and rather than practice self-denial, they will forego the
 most valuable considerations. If one must be relinquished, the
 gratification of a depraved appetite or the heavenly blessings
 promised only to the self-denying and God-fearing, the claims
 of appetite prevail, and God and heaven are virtually despised.
 How many, even of professed Christians, cling to indul-
 gences that are injurious to health, and that benumb the sen-
 sibilities of the soul. When the duty is presented of cleansing
26          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

themselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfect-
ing holiness in the fear of God, they are offended. They see
that they cannot retain these hurtful gratifications and yet
secure heaven, and they conclude that since the way to eternal
life is so strait, they will no longer walk therein."- Id.,
pp. 181, 182.

                             Notes
   1. "Years passed on, until Isaac, old and blind, and expect-
ing soon to die, determined no longer to delay the bestowal of
the blessing upon his elder son. But knowing the opposition
of Rebekah and Jacob, he decided to perform the solemn cere-
mony in secret. . . . Rebekah divined his purpose. She was
confident that it was contrary to what God had revealed as
His will. Isaac was in danger of incurring the divine dis-
pleasure, and of debarring his younger soh from the position
to which God had called him. She had in vain tried the effect
of reasoning with Isaac, and she determined to resort to
stratagem."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 179, 180.
    2. "Jacob did not readily consent to the plan that she
proposed. The thought of deceiving his father caused him
great distress. He felt that such a sin would bring a curse
rather than a blessing. But his scruples were overborne, and
he proceeded to carry out his mother's suggestions. It was
not his intention to utter a direct falsehood, but once in the
presence of his father he seemed to have gone too far to re-
treat, and he obtained by fraud the coveted blessing."— Id.,

    3. "Trembling with astonishment and distress, the blind
 old father learned the deception that had been practiced upon
 him. His long and fondly cherished hopes had been thwarted,
and he keenly felt the disappointment that must come upon
 his elder son. Yet the conviction flashed upon him that it
was God's providence which had defeated his purpose, and
brought about the very thing he had determined to prevent.
 He remembered the words of the angel to Rebekah, and not-
withstanding the sin of which Jacob was now guilty, he saw
in him the one best fitted to accomplish the purpose of God.
 While the words of blessing were upon his lips, he had felt the
Spirit of inspiration upon him; and now, knowing all the
circumstances, he ratified the benediction unwittingly pro-
nounced upon Jacob: 'I have blessed him; yea, and he shall
be blessed.' "— Id., p. 181.
    4. "Esau had lightly valued the blessing while it seemed
within his reach, but he desired to possess it now that it was
gone from him forever. All the strength Of his impulsive,
passionate nature was aroused, and his grief and rage were
terrible. He cried with an exceeding bitter cry, 'Bless me,
even me also, 0 my father!' Hast thou not reserved a bless-
ing for me?' But the promise given was not to be recalled.
The birthright which he had so carelessly bartered, he could
not now regain. Tor one morsel of meat,' for a momentary
gratification of appetite that had never been restrained, Esau
sold his inheritance; but when he saw his folly, it was too late
to recover the blessing. 'He found no place of repentance,
though he sought it carefully with tears.' Esau was not shut
out from the privilege of seeking God's favor by repentance;
but he could find no means of recovering the birthright. His
grief did not spring from conviction of sin; he did not desire
to be reconciled to God. He sorrowed because of the results
of his sin, but not for the sin itself."— Ibid.

       Note 8.
                             Notes
   1. "The Bible rings from end to end with warnings against
mixed marriages. . . . A mixed marriage is a prolific source
of misery. In the course of a considerable pastoral ex-
perience, I have never known one to result in perfect happi-
ness. Believers, in such unions, do not level their unbelieving
partners up to Christ; but are themselves d"ragged down to
infinite misery and self-reproach. . . . Each feels that there
is one subject on which they are not agreed; and this is a
fatal barrier to perfect union. The ungodly partner despises
the Christian for marrying in the teeth of principle. The
Christian is disappointed because the apparent influence
gained before marriage is dissipated soon after the knot is
irrevocably tied. Well might Rebekah be weary of her life
through those daughters of Heth! Many a Christian girl has
30          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

 married an unbeliever, in the hope of saving him, and has
bitterly rued her choice: she has seen her influence wane; and
 has learned, though too late, that the Holy Spirit will not co-
operate with our efforts, if they are based on distinct disobedi-
ence to one of the clearest commands of the Bible."— F. B.
Meyer.
     2. "The evening of the second day found him far away
from his father's tents. He felt that he was an outcast, and
he knew that all this trouble had been brought upon him by
his own wrong course. The darkness of despair pressed upon
his soul, and he hardly dared to pray. But he was so utterly
lonely that he felt the need of protection from God as he had
never felt it before. With weeping and deep humiliation he
confessed his sin, and entreated for some evidence that he
was not utterly forsaken. Still his burdened heart found no
relief. He had lost all confidence in himself, and he feared
that the God of his fathers had cast him off. . . . Wearied
with his journey, the wanderer lay down upon the ground,
with a stone for his pillow."—"Patriarchs and Prophets,"
 p. 183.
     3. "The mystic ladder revealed to him in his dream was
the same to which Christ referred in His conversation with
Nathanael. Said He, 'Ye shall see heaven open, and the
angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.'
Up to the time of man's rebellion against the government of
God, there had been free communication between God and
man. But the sin of Adam and Eve separated earth from
heaven, so that man could not have communion with his
Maker. Yet the world was not left in solitary hopelessness.
The ladder represents Jesus, the appointed medium of com-
munication. Had He not with His own merits bridged the
gulf that sin had made, the ministering angels could have held
no communion with fallen man. Christ connects man in his
weakness and helplessness with the source of infinite power."
— Id., p. 184.
     4. ",The Lord knew the evil influences that would sur-
round Jacob, and the perils to which he would be exposed.
In mercy He opened up the future before the repentant
fugitive, that he might understand the divine purpose with
reference to himself, and be prepared to resist the temptations
that would surely come to him when alone amid idolaters and
scheming men. There would be ever before him the high
standard at which he must aim; and the knowledge that
through him the purpose of God was reaching its accomplish-
ment, would constantly prompt him to faithfulness."— Ibid.
     5. "What comfort Jacob must have realized! He found,
to his great surprise, that that lone spot was as thickly popu-
lated as the gate of some Eastern town, which is the place
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
                                                           31

of concourse and barter. But it was the gate of heaven; for
it seemed as if the populations of heaven were teeming
around him, thronging to and fro; and all engaged in the
beneficent work of bringing in the needs of men, and carry-
ing out the blessings of God heaped up, after the overflowing
measure with which He is wont to give. We need never yield
to feelings of loneliness again, if we remember that, in
our most retired hours, we are living in the very heart of a
vast throng of angels; and we should hear their songs, and
see their forms, if only our senses were not clogged. with
sin."— P. B. Meyer.
     6. "Jacob was not here seeking to make terms with God.
The Lord had already promised him prosperity, and this
vow was the outflow of a heart filled with gratitude for the
assurance of God's love and mercy. Jacob felt that God had
claims upon him which he must acknowledge, and that the
special tokens of divine favor granted demanded a return.
So does every blessing bestowed upon us call for a response to
the Author of all our mercies."—"Patriarchs and Prophets,"
p. 187.
     7. The setting up and anointing of the pillar in Bethel
is. important as illustrating ancient religious ideas. Several
of these pillars are mentioned in the history of Jacob. (See
Gen. 31: 45; 35: 20; Joshua 24: 26.) These were memorial
stones, marking the scene of the divine revelation, and stood
as a symbol of His presence.
     8. "The Christian should often review his past life, and
recall with gratitude the precious deliverances that God has
 wrought for him, supporting him in trial, opening ways be-
 fore him when all seemed dark and forbidding, refreshing
 him when ready to faint. He should recognize all of them as
 evidences of the watch-care of heavenly angels. In view of
 these innumerable blessings he should often ask, with sub-
 dued and grateful heart, 'What shall I render unto the Lord
 for all His benefits toward me?' "— Ibid.

                              Notes
    1. "With a new and abiding faith in the divine promises,
and assured of the presence and guardianship of heavenly
angels, Jacob pursued his journey to 'the land of the children
of the East.' But how different his arrival from that of
Abraham's messenger nearly a hundred years before! The
servant had come with a train of attendants riding upon
camels, and with rich gifts of gold and silver; the son was
a lonely, foot-sore traveler, with no possession save his staff."
—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 188.
    2. "But the selfish and grasping Laban, desiring to re-
tain so valuable a helper, practiced a cruel deception in
substituting Leah for Rachel. The fact that Leah herself
was a party to the cheat, caused Jacob to feel that he could
not love her. His indignant rebuke to Laban was met with
the offer of Rachel for another seven years' service. But the
father insisted that Leah should not be discarded, since this
would bring disgrace upon the family. Jacob was thus placed
in a most painful and trying position; he finally decided to re-
tain Leah and marry Rachel. Rachel was ever the one best
loved; but his preference for her excited envy and jealousy,
and his life was embittered by the rivalry between the sister-
wives."— Id., pp. 189, 190.
    3. "In early times, custom required the bridegroom, be-
fore the ratification of a marriage engagement, to pay a sum
of money or its equivalent . . . to the father of     wife. . . .
Generally the dowry which the father had received was given
her at her marriage. In the case of both Rachel and Leah,
however, Laban selfishly retained the dowry that should have
been given them; they referred to this when they said, just
before the removal from Mesopotamia, 'He bath sold us, and
bath quite devoured also our money.' "— Id., pp. 188, 18g.
    4. "Jacob would have left his crafty kinsman long before,
but for the fear of encountering Esau. Now he felt that he
34            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

was in danger from the sons of Laban, who, looking upon his
wealth as their own, might endeavor to secure it by violence.
He was in great perplexity and distress, not knowing which
way to turn. But mindful of the gracious Bethel promise, he
carried his case to God, and sought direction from Him.
In a dream his prayer was answered: 'Return unto the land
of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.'"
— Id., p. 193.
    5. Jacob's experiences in Haran were necessary in order
that he might learn the defects of his own nature and the
eternal principles of the golden rule. "That which we do to
others, whether it be good or evil, will surely react upon our-
selves, in blessing or in cursing. Whatever we give, we shall
receive again. The earthly blessings which we impart to
others, may be, and often are, repaid in kind. What we give
does, in time of need, often come back to us in fourfold
measure in the coin of the realm. But, besides this, all gifts
are repaid, even in this life, in the fuller inflowing of His
love, which is the sum of all heaven's glory and its treasure.
And evil imparted, also returns again. Every one who has
been free to condemn or discourage, will in his own experience
be brought over the ground where he has caused others to
pass; he will feel what they have suffered because of his want
of sympathy and tenderness."—"Thoughts from the Mount of
Blessing," p. 194, new edition.

36          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

                              Notes
     1. "As he drew near his journey's end, the thought of
 Esau brought many a troubled foreboding. After the flight
 of Jacob, Esau had regarded himself as the sole heir of their
 father's possessions. The news of Jacob's return would ex-
 cite the fear that he was coming to claim the inheritance.
 Esau was now able to do his brother great injury, if so dis-
 posed, and he might be moved to violence against him, not
 only by the desire for revenge, but in order to secure undis-
 turbed possession of the wealth which he had so long looked
 upon as his own."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 195.
     2. "He [Jacob] therefore dispatched messengers with a
 conciliatory greeting to his brother. He instructed them as to
 the exact words in which they were to address Esau. It had
 been foretold before the birth of the two brothers, that the
 elder should serve the younger, and lest the memory of this
 should be a cause of bitterness, Jacob told the servants they
were sent to 'my lord Esau;' when brought before him, they
 were to refer to their master as thy servant Jacob;' and to
 remove the fear that he was returning, a destitute wanderer,
 to claim the paternal inheritance, Jacob was careful to state,
 in his message, 'I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and men-
servants, and womenservants; and I have sent to tell my lord,
 that I may find grace in thy sight.' "— Id., pp. 195, 196.
     3. "The struggle continued until near the break of day,
when the stranger placed his finger upon Jacob's thigh, and
he was crippled instantly. The patriarch now discerned the
character of his antagonist. He knew that he had been in
conflict with a heavenly messenger, and this was why his
almost superhuman effort had not gained the victory. It was
Christ, 'the Angel of the covenant,' who had revealed Himself
to Jacob. The patriarch was now disabled, and suffering the
keenest pain, but he would not loosen his hold. All penitent
and broken, he clung to the Angel; 'he wept, and made sup-
plication,' pleading for a blessing. He must have the as-
surance that his sin was pardoned. Physical pain was not
sufficient to divert his mind from this object. His determina,
tion grew stronger, his faith more earnest and persevering,
until the very last. The Angel tried to release Himself; He
urged, 'Let Me go, for the day breaketh;' but Jacob answered,
`I will not let Thee go, except Thou bless me.' Had this been
a boastful, presumptuous confidence, Jacob would have been
instantly destroyed; but his was the assurance of one who
confesses his own unworthiness, yet trusts the faithfulness of
a covenant-keeping God."— Id., p. 197.
    4. "As an evidence that he had been forgiven, his name
was changed from one that was a reminder of hie sin, to one
that commemorated his victory."— Id., p. 198.
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   87
     "Jacob's external struggle was the result of a mightier
struggle within. It was a strife between self and God. When
the Angel gained the victory over that soul, Jacob was cruci-
fied; it was then that, in the strength of his mighty Contest-
ant, he conquered; it was then that Jacob, the supplanter,
could receive a new name, Israel, prince of God, power with
man. That night had been one of darkness and suffering,
but the morning was one of light and glory. The greatest
suffering precedes the greatest glory. Now Jacob could see
the face of God, and as he 'passed over Penuel,' the sun rose
upon him. Just so, when we pass through 'the night of
Jacob's trouble,' we shall be prepared through suffering, with
bodies glorified, to behold with joy the face of God; and 'the
Sun of Righteousness shall arise with healing in His wings.'
Suffering precedes the glory." See Luke 24: 26; Dan. 11 : 35;
Acts 14: 22; Phil. 3: 21; Rom. 8: 18; 2 Tim. 2: 12.
     5. "Jacob 'had power over the Angel, and prevailed.'
 Through humiliation, repentance, and self-surrender, this
sinful, erring mortal prevailed with the Majesty of heaven.
He had fastened his trembling grasp upon the promises ,of
God, and the heart of Infinite Love could not turn away the
sinner's plea."-- Id., p. 197.
      6. "While Jacob was wrestling with the Angel, another
 heavenly, messenger was sent to Esau. In a dream,Esau
 beheld his brother for twenty years an exile front his ther's
 house; he witnessed his grief at finding his mother dead; he
 saw him encompassed by the hosts of God. This' dream was
 related by Esau to his soldiers, with the charge not to harm
 Jacob, for the God of his father was with him."— Id., p. 198.
      7. "Jacob's experience during that night of wrestling and
 anguish represents the trial through which the people of God
 must pass just before Christ's second coming. The prophet
 Jeremiah, in holy vision looking down to this time, said: 'We
 have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace.
 . . . All faces are turned into paleness. Alas! for that day
 is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob's
 trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.' When Christ shall
 cease His work as mediator in man's behalf, then this time
 of trouble will begin. Then the case of every soul will have
 been decided, and there will be no atoning blood to cleanse
 from sin. . . . Then the restraining Spirit of God is with-
 drawn from the earth. As Jacob was threatened with death
  by his angry brother, so the people of God will be in peril
  from the wicked who are seeking to destroy them. And as
  the patriarch wrestled all night for deliverance from the
  hand of Esau, so the righteous will cry to God'day and night
  for deliverance from the enemies that surround them."•'..L.

    "We can do nothing of ourselves. In all our helpless un-
worthiness we must trust in the merits of the crucified and
risen Saviour. None will ever perish while they do this. The
long, black catalogue of our delinquencies is before the eye of
the Infinite. The register is complete; none of our offenses
are forgotten. But He who listened to the cries of His serv-
ants of old, will hear the prayer of faith, and pardon our
transgressions."- Id., p. 203.

                             Notes
    1. "Cain hated and killed his brother, not for any wrong
that Abel had done, but 'because his own works were evil,
and his brother's righteous.' So in all ages the wicked have
hated those who were better than themselves. Abel's life of
obedience and unswerving faith was to Cain a perpetual re-
proof. 'Everyone that doeth evil hateth the light, neither
comcth to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.' The
brighter the heavenly light that is reflected from the charac-
ter of God's faithful servants, the more clearly the sins of the
 ungodly are revealed, and the more determined will be their
efforts to destroy those who disturb their peace."—"Patriarchs
 and Prophets," p. 74.
    2. " 'As it was in the days of Noah,' even thus shall it be
in the day when the Son of man is revealed.' The day of
 the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the
heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements
 shall melt with fervent heat, th-„. earth also, and the works
 that are therein shall be burned up.' When the reasoning of
40          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
philosophy has banished the fear of God's judgments; when
religious teachers are pointing forward to long ages of peace
and prosperity, and the world are absorbed in their rounds of
business and pleasure, planting and building, feasting and
merrymaking, rejecting God's warnings and mocking His
messengers,— then it is that sudden destruction cometh upon
them, and they shall not escape."— Id., p. 104.
    3. "The sacrifice required of Abraham was not alone for
his own good, nor solely for the benefit of succeeding genera-
tions; but it was also for the instruction of the sinless in-
telligences of heaven and o5 other worlds. The field of the
controversy between Christ and Satan,— the field on which
the plan of redemption is wrought out,— is the lesson book
of the universe. . . .
    "Heavenly beings were witnesses of the scene as the faith
of Abraham and the submission of Isaac were tested. The
trial was far more severe than that which had been brought
upon Adam. . . . All heaven beheld with wonder and admira-
tion Abraham's unfaltering obedience. All heaven applauded
his fidelity. . . . God's covenant, confirmed to Abraham by
an oath before the intelligences of other worlds, testified that
obedience will be rewarded."— Id., pp. 154, 155.
    4. "The flames that consumed the cities of the plain shed
their warning light down even to our time. We are taught the
fearful and solemn lesson that while God's mercy bears long
with the transgressor, there is a limit beyond which men may
not go on in sin. When that limit is reached, then the offers
of mercy are withdrawn, and the ministration of judgment
begins. . . . The world is fast becoming ripe for destruction.
Soon the judgments of God are to be poured out, and sin and
sinners are to be consumed."— Id., pp. 162, 165, 166.
    5. "No one who fears God can without danger connect
himself with one who fears Him not. Tan two Walk together,
except they be agreed?' The happiness and prosperity of the
marriage relation depends upon the unity of the parties; but
between the believer and the unbeliever there is a radical
difference of tastes, inclinations, and purposes. They are
serving two masters, between whom there can be no concord.
However pure and correct one's principles may be, the in-
fluence of an unbelieving companion will have a tendency to
lead away from God."— Id., p. 174.
    6. "Jacob had received the blessing for which his soul had
longed. His sin as a supplanter and deceiver had been par-
doned. The crisis in his life was past. Doubt, perplexity,
and remorse had embittered his existence, but now all was
changed; and sweet was the peace of reconciliation with God.
Jacob no longer feared to meet his brother: God, who had
 forgiven his sin, could move the heart of Esau also to accept
 his humiliation and repentance."— Id., p. 198.
