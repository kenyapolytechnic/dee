                                                                    •v
 THE CONFLICT OF THE AGES SERIES
                        By Mrs. E. G. White

                              This beautiful set covers the entire
                            chain of Bible history, from the be-
                            ginning of Genesis, the fall of man,
                            and the plan of redemption, through
                            until the conflict is ended and the
                            earth restored.
                               Vol. 1—"Patriarchs and Prophets"
                            opens the story at the beginning, with'
                            creation. Then it covers the entrance
                            of sin, the apostasy before the Flood,
                            and the experiences of the Israelites.
                             Vol. 2—"Prophets and Kings" goes
                         still further into the story of the "cho-
                         sen people," covering parts of Bible his-
                         tory about which little has been writ-
                         ten,—the reign of Solomon, the building
of the temple, the lives of the prophets, down through Old Tes-
tament history until the coming of the Deliverer, Jesus Christ.
   Vol. 3—"The Desire df Ages" follows with its beautiful pres-
entation of the life of the Saviour. It traces His earthly
experiences from birth and through His early years and on
through His ministry.
   Vol. 4—"The Acts of the Apostles" is truly "a record of God's
witnesses subsequent to the life of our Lord." Deep spiritual
lessons of value to the Christian and to the Christian church
of to-day are taught.
   Vol. 5—"The Great Controversy Between Christ and Satan"
introduces later great Christian movements,—the Reformation,
the growth of Protestantism, and the rise and growth of the
last great religious movement pictured in the Revelation.

   This five-volume set is a wonderful library, which should
be in every Christian home. Each volume is complete in
itself. Printed on American Bible paper. Inclosed in a sub-
stantial box.

the Creator, and the one for whom the beautiful earth had
been fitted up, was brought upon the stage of action."—"Pa-
triarchs and Prophets," p. 44.
    2. "Man was to bear God's image, both in outward resem-
blance and in character. Christ alone is 'the express image'
of the Father; but man was formed in the likeness of God.
His nature was in harmony with the will of God. His mind
was capable of comprehending divine things. His affections

trol of reason. He was holy and happy in bearing the image

giance of love, there was perfect harmony throughout the
universe of God. It was the joy of the heavenly host to fulfill
the purpose of their Creator. They delighted in reflecting
His glory and showing forth His praise. And while love to
God was supreme, love for one another was confiding and un-
selfish. There was no note of discord to mar the celestial
harmonies."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 35.
    "The will of God is to be done on earth, as it is done in
heaven. The nations of the saved will know no other law than

Christ's righteousness."—"Ministry of Healing," p. 506.

    "Heavenly angels have long been waiting for human
agents—the members of the church—to cooperate with them

                             Notes
    1. "To man the first intimation of redemption was com-
municated in the sentence pronounced upon Satan in the
garden. The Lord declared, 'I will put enmity between thee
and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall
bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.' This sentence,
uttered in the hearing of our first parents, was to them a
promise. While it foretold war between man and Satan, it
declared that the power of the great adversal7 would finally
be broken. . . . Though they must suffer from the power of
their mighty foe, they could look forward to final victory."—
"Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 65, 66.
    2. "Our Saviour does not promise that those who follow
Him shall have no difficulties. Satan will continually seek to
misrepresent God to every mind. . . . Satan would make
the Christian warfare as hard as possible for every one who
is determined to follow Christ; for it is his purpose to fasten
every soul in. deception."—Mrs. E. G. White, in the "Review
and Herald," July 5, 1892.
    3. Referring to the time when the conflict with sin is over,
the following comment is made in "The Great Controversy,"
page 673: "Satan's work of ruin is forever ended. For six
thousand years he has wrought his will, filling the earth with
woe, and causing grief throughout the universe. The whole
creation has groaned and travailed together in pain. Now
God's creatures are forever delivered from his presence and
temptations." And again on page 678: "The great con-
troversy is ended. Sin and sinners are no more. The entire
universe is clean. One pulse of harmony and gladness beats
through the vast creation."
    4. In the days of slavery, near the close of the Civil War,
an old slave was placed on the auction block, where he silently
awaited his disposal to the highest bidder. He bore the marks
of hard and faithful service, by which his market value was
considerably increased; but, as a slave, it mattered not that
beneath the exterior there beat a heart breaking with the
thought of leaving all that he knew of home and family ties
to continue a life of servitude for whoever might be able to
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    7

pay the required sum. With bowed head, and in absolute de-
jection, he sat while the auctioneer shouted his servile merits
and the bidding of ambitious taskmasters rose higher. He
cared not what price was bidden, he cared not to whom he
was sold. He was a slave, and a slave forever, as far as he
had reason to know. Finally the sale was completed. The
owner stepped up to the slave, and, putting his hand on his
shoulder, said,
    "Well, my man, I have bought you."
    "Yes, massa," came the disconsolate reply, without even an
upward glance.
    "But, my man, you are mine now: I have paid a big
price for you."            .
    "Yes, massa," said the slave, but with no manifestation of
the slightest pleasure or interest in his new master.
    "And, my man," said the owner, "I have bought you to
set yoy free. You are a free man now; no longer a slave to
any one. Stand up and be a free man!"
    As the comprehension of these glad words gradually en-
tered the old slave's mind, he raised his eyes to his liberator,
while tears of joy and gratitude ran down his face, and he
exclaimed,
    "Oh, massa, I am your slave forever!"
    Voluntary, absolute slavery to the loving heavenly Master,
who has paid the redemption price of the precious blood of
Christ, is the longing of the soul who experiences release
from the bondage of sin.
    5. The apostle declares that "all have sinned." Rom. 3:
23. Sin is universal as far as this world is concerned. None
are exempt. It has made a breach between God and man
which nothing save the gospel plan can close. It was `God's
original plan that man, created in innocency and holiness,
should constantly reflect the glory of God. But sin broke
into the plan, separated man from his Maker, planted enmity
in his heart, and stained his soul with a moral taint which
nothing but the gospel could remove. The cure must extend
as far as the disease. Td effect this, the Lord devised a plan
wherein He made provision for every soul to bear witness in
behalf of the one and only remedy. This work He has Com-
mitted to His church, called out of darkness into His mar-
velous light. Its work is to bear witness to the gospel to the
ends of the earth.
    6. "Those who do love God with all the heart, will desire
to give Him the best service of their life, and they will be con-
stantly seeking to bring every power of their being into
harmony with the laws that will promote their ability to do
His will."—"The Great Controversy," pp. 473, 474. •

    1. "In every age the Lord has had His watchmen, who
have borne a faithful testimony to the generation in which
they, lived. These sentinels gave 'the message of warning;
and when they were called to lay off their armor, others took
up the work. God brought these witnesses into covenant rela-
tion with Himself, uniting the church on earth With the church -
in heaven."—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 11.
    2. "All who are born of God will become coworkers with
Christ. Such are the salt of the earth. 'But if the salt have
lost his savor, wherewith shall it ,be salted?' If the religion
we profess fails to renew our hearts and sanctify our lives,
how shall it exert a saving power upon believers? 'It is
thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be
trodden underfoot of men.' That religion which will not exert
a regenerating power upon the world, is of no value. We
cannot trust it for our own salvation. The sooner we cast
it away the better: for it is powerless and spurious."—"Testi-
monies for the Church," vol. 5, p. 389.
    "The good works of the children of God are the most ef-
fectual preaching that the unbeliever has."—Id., vol. 1, p. 193.
    3. "It was for the purpose of bringing the best gifts of
Heaven to all the peoples of earth, that God called Abraham •
out from his idolatrous kindred, and bade him dwell in the
land of Canaan."—"Prophets and Kings," p. 15.
    4. "God had chosen Israel. He had called them to preserve
among men the knowledge of His law, and of the symbols and
prophecies that pointed to the Saviour. He desired them to be
as wells of salvation to the world. What Abraham was in
the land of his sojourn, what Joseph was in Egypt, and Daniel
in the courts of Babylon, the Hebrew people were to be among
the nations. They were to reveal God to men."—"The De=
sire of Ages," p. 27.
    5. "Not alone the men of Israel, but 'all the women and
the little ones,' listened to the reading of the law; for it was
important that they also should know and do their duty. . . .
Greater attention should be given by religious teachers to in-
structing the people in the facts and lessons of 'Bible history
and the warnings and requirements of the Lord. These should
be presented in simple language, adapted to the comprehen-
sion of children. It should be a part of the work both of
10      . SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

  ministers and parents to see that the young are instructed in
 the Scriptures."-"Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 503, 504.
     "We know not in what line our children may be called to
  serve. They may spend their lives within the circle of the
. home; they may engage in life's common vocations, or go as
 teachers of the gospel to heathen lands; but all are alike called
 to be missionaries for God, ministers of mercy to the world.
  They are to obtain an education that will help them to stand
 by the side of Christ in unselfish service."-"Prophets and
Kings," p. 245.

                              Notes
    1. During the reign of David, there existed among the
Israelites a period of rest from their enemies, and peace and
prosperity. A very complete system of organization was op-
erative, tending to promote unity of heart and purpose, arid
 liberality in gifts and service for the advancement of God's
cause. "In the reign of David and Solomon, Israel became
strong among the nations, and had many opportunities to
wield a mighty influence in behalf of truth and the right. The
name of Jehovah was exalted and held in honor, and the pur-
 pose for which the Israelites had been established' in the land
 of promise bade fair of meeting with fulfillment. Barriers
 were broken down, and seekers after truth from the lands of
 the heathen were not turned away unsatisfied. Conversions
 took place, and the church of God on earth was enlarged and
 prospered."—"Prophets and Kings," p. 25.
.    "The name of Jehovah was greatly honored during the first
 part of Solomon's reign. The wisdom and righteousness re-
 vealed by the king bore witness to all nations of the excellency
of the' attributes of the God whom he served. For a time
 Israel was as the light of the world."—Id., p. 32.
     2. "God had designed that His people should be the light of
 the world. From them was to shine forth the glory of His
 law as revealed in the life practice. For the carrying out of
 this design, He had caused the chosen nation to occupy a stra-
12          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

tegic position among the nations of earth. In the days of
Solomon the kingdom of Israel extended from Hamath on the
north to Egypt on the south, and from the Mediterranean
Sea to the river Euphrates. Through this territory ran many
natural highways of the world's commerce, and caravans
from distant lands were constantly passing to and fro. Thus
there was given to Solomon and his people opportunity to re-
veal to men of all nations the character of the King of kings,
and to teach them to reverence and obey Him. . . . Placed at
the head of a nation that had been set as a beacon light to the




     "He failed of improving his splendid opportunities."


surrounding nations, Solomon should have used his God-given
wisdom and power of influence in organizing and directing a
great movement for the enlightenment of those who were ig-
norant of God and His truth."—Id., pp. 70, 71.
   3. "He [Solomon] failed of improving his splendid op-
portunities for enlightening those who were continually pass-
ing through his territory or tarrying at the principal cities.
The missionary spirit that God had implanted in the heart of
Solomon and in the hearts of all true Israelites was supplanted
by a spirit of commercialism. The opportunities afforded by
contact with many nations were used for personal aggrandize-
ment. . . The revenue of the king and of many of his sub-
jects was greatly increased, birt at what a cost! Through the
cupidity and shortsightedness of those to whom had been in-
trusted the oracles of God, the countless multitudes who
thronged the highways of travel were allowed to remain 'in
ignorance of Jehovah."—Id., pp. 71, 72.
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    13

    4. "In striking contrast•to the course pursued by Solomon
was the course followed by Christ when He was on this earth.
The Saviour, though possessing 'all power,' never used this
power for self-aggrandizement. No dream of earthly con-
quest, of worldly greatness, marred the perfection of His
service for mankind."—Id., p. 73.
    5. "Those who, in response to the call of the hour, have en-
tered the service of the Master Worker, may well study His
methods. He took advantage of the opportunities to be found
along the great thoroughfares of travel. . . . In this our day,
the opportunities for coming into contact with men and women
of all classes and many nationalities are much greater than in
the days of Israel. The thoroughfares of travel have mul-
tiplied a thousandfold. Like Christ, the messengers of the
Most High to-day should take their position in these great
thoroughfares, where they can meet the passing multitudes
from all parts of the world. Like Him hiding self in God,
they are to sow the gospel seed, presenting before others the
precidus truths of Holy Scripture that will take deep root
in mind and heart, and spring up unto life eternal."—Id.,
pp. 73, 74.
     6. "Solemn are the lessons of Israel's failure during the
 years when ruler and people turned from the high purpose
 they had been called to fulfill. Wherein they were weak, even
to the point of failure, the Israel of God to-day, the representa-
tives of heaven that make up the true church of Christ, must
 be strong; for upon them devolves the task of finishing the
 work that has been committed to man, and of ushering in the
 day of final awards. Yet the same influences that prevailed
against Israel in the time when Solomon reigned, are to be met
 with still. The forces of the enemy of all righteousness are
 strongly intrenched; only by the power of God can the victory
 be gained. The conflict before us calls for the exercise of
a spirit of self-denial; for distrust of self and for dependence
 on God alone; for the wise use of every opportunity for the
 saving of souls."—Id., p. 74.

    "Anything less than active, earnest service for, the Master
gives the lie to our profession of faith. Only the Christian-
ity that is revealed by earnest, practical work will make an
impression upon those who are dead in trespasses and sins."—
"Testimonies for the-Church," vol. 6, p. 417.
    "It is heart missionaries that are needed. Spasmodic ef-
forts will do little good. We must arrest the attention. We
must be deeply in earnest."—Id., vol. 9, p. 45.

                               Notes
     1. "Jesus says, `Abidd in Me.' These words convey, the
idea of rest, stability, confidence. . . . This rest is not found
in inactivity; for in the Saviour's invitation`the promise of
rest is united with the call to labor : 'Take My yoke upon you,
. . . and ye shall find rest.' The heart that rests most fully
upon Christ will be most earnest and active in labor for Him."
—"Steps to Christ," pp. 75, 76.
     2. "Thus was the church of God comforted in one of the
darkest hours of her long conflict with the forces of evil.
Satan had seemingly triumphed in his efforts to destroy Is-
rael; but the Lord was overruling the events of the present,
and during the years that were to follow, His people were to
have opportunity to redeem the past."—"Prophets and
Kings," p. 474.
     3. "tumbled in the sight of the nations, those who once
had been recognized as favored of Heaven above all other
peoples of the earth were to learn in exile the lesson of obedi-
ence so necessary for their future happiness. Until they had
learned this lesson, God could not do for them all that. He de-
sired to do."—Id., p. 475.
     4. "Yet those who had been the object of His tender love
were not forever set aside; before all the nations of earth He
would demonstrate His plan to bring victory out of apparent
defeat, to save rather than to destroy."—Ibid.
     "Among the children of Israel who were carried captive
to Babylon at the beginning of the seventy years' captivity
were Christian patriots, men who were as true as steel to prin-
ciple, who would not be corrupted by . selfishness, but who
would honor God at the loss of all things. In the land of
their captivity these men were to carry out God's purpose by
givihg to heathen nations the blessings that come through a
knowledge of Jehovah."—Id., p. 479.
     "In affliction many renewed their faithfulness to His cove-
nant: . . . The light of truth shone out through them, and
a knowledge of God was spread among the nations."—"The
 Desire of Ages," p. 28.
 16          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

     "The work which the church has failed to do in a time of
  peace and prosperity, she will have to do in a terrible crisis,
 under most discouraging, forbidding circumstances. . . . The
 members of the church will individually be tested and proved.
 They will be placed in circumstances where they will be forced
 to bear witness for the truth."—"Testimonies for the Church,"
 vol. 5, p. 46.9.
     5. "He [God] imparted to Mose's, in the form of a
 prophecy, a knowledge' of His purpose concerning the final
 triumph of Israel. 'As truly as I live,' He declared, 'all the
 earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord.' God's glory,
 His character, His merciful kindness and tender love,—that
 which Moses had pleaded in behalf of Israel,—was to be re-
 vealed to all mankind. And this promise of Jehovah was
 made doubly sure; it was confirmed by an oath. As surely
 as God lives and reigns, His glory should be declared 'among
 the heathen, His wonders among all- people.'
     "It was concerning the future fulfillment of this prophecy
 that Isaiah had heard the shining seraphim singing before the
 throne, 'The whole earth is full of His glory.' The prophet,
 confident of the certainty of these words, himself afterward
 boldly declared of those who were bowing down to images of
 wood and stone, 'They shall see the glory of the,Lord, and the
 excellency of ,our God.'
     "To-day this prophecy is meeting rapid fulfillment. The
 missionary activities of the church of God on earth ate bear-
 ing rich fruitage, and soon the gospel message' will have been
 proclaimed to all nations. 'To the praise of the glory of His
grace,' men and women from every kindred, tongue, and people
 are being made 'accepted in the Beloved.' "—"Prophets and
 Kings," pp. 313, 314.
     "In proclaiming the truths of the everlasting gospel to
 every nation, kindred, tongue, and people; God's church on
earth to-day is fulfilling the ancient prophecy, 'Israel shall
 blossom and bud, and fill the face of the world with fruit.'
 The followers of Jesus, in cooperation with heavenly intelli-
 gences, are rapidly occupying the waste places of the earth;
 and as the result of their labors, an abundant fruitage of
 precious souls is developing. To-day, as never before, the
 dissemination of Bible truth by means of a consecrated church
 is bringing to the sons of men the benefits foreshadowed cen-
 turies ago in the promise to Abraham and to all Israel—
 to God's church on earth in every age—`I will bless thee, . .
Sand thou shalt be, a blessing.' "—Id., p. 703.
     6. "Among the children of Israel who were carried cap-
 tive to Babylon at the beginning of the seventy years' cap-
 tivity were Christian patriots, men who were as true as steel
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                "17
to principle. . . . Among those who maintained their al-
legiance to God were Daniel and his three .companions,-il-
lustrious examples of what men may become who unite with
the God of wisdom and power."-Id., pp. 479, 480.
    7. "While God was working in Daniel and his companions
`to will and to do of His good pleasure,' they were working
out their own salvation. Herein is revealed the outworking
of the divine principle of cooperation, without which no true
success can be attained. Human effort avails nothing without
divine power; and without human endeavor, divine effort is
with many of no avail. To make God's grace our own, we
must act our part. His grace is given to work in us to will
and to do, but never as a substitute for our effort."-Id.,
pp. 486, 487.

    1. "The hope of Israel was embodied in the promise made
at the time of the call of Abraham, and afterward repeated
again and again to his posterity. . . . This• same blessed
hope was foreshadowed in the benediction pronounced by the
dying patriarch Jacob upon his son Judah."-"Prophets and
Kings," p. 683.
    "From the days of Enoch the promises repeated through
patriarchs and prophets had kept alive the hope of His ap-
pearing."-Id., p. 700.

had been determined. When the great clock of time pointed
to that hour, Jesus was born in Bethlehem."-"The Desire of
Ages," p. 32.
    3. "The 'time' which He declared to be fulfilled was the
period made known by the angel Gabriel to Daniel. . . . In
A. D. 27, Jesus at His baptism received the anointing of the
Holy Spirit, and soon afterward began His ministry. Then
the message was proclaimed, 'The time is fulfilled.' "-
Id., p. 233.

     4. "As a nation, the people of Israel, while desiring the
advent of the MeSsiah, were so far separated from God in
heart and life that they could have no true conception of the
character or mission of the promised Redeemer."—"Prophets
and Kings," p. 709.
     "The Jews had sought to make a monopoly of the truth
which is eternal life. They had hoarded the living manna, and
it had turned to corruption. The religion which they tried to
shut up to themselves became an offense. They robbed God
of His glory, and defrauded the world by a counterfeit of the
gospel. They had refused to surrender themselves to God
for the salvation of the world,. and they became agents of
 Satan for its destruction."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 36.
     5. "For more than a thousand years the Jewish people had
waited the coming of the promised Saviour. Their brightest
 hopes had rested upon this event. For a thousand years, in
song and prophecy, in temple rite and household prayer, His'
 name had been enshrined; and yet when He came, they did
 not recognize Him as the Messiah for whom they had so long
waited."—"Prophets and Kings," p. 710.
      6. "The goodly vine planted by the divine Husbandman
 upon the hills of Palestine was despised by the men of Is-
 rael, and was finally cast over the vineyard wall; they bruised
 it, and trampled it under their feet, and hoped that they had
destroyed it forever. The Husbandman removed the vine, and
 concealed it from their sight. Again He planted it, but on
 the other side of the wall, and in such a manner that the stock
 was no longer visible. The branches hung over the wall, and
 grafts might be joined to it, but the stem itself was placed
 beyond the power of men to reach or harm."—Id., pp. 21, 22.
      7. "The story of Israel's call, of their successes and fail-
 ures, of their restoration to divine favor, of their rejection
 of the Master of the vineyard, and of the carrying out of the
 plan of the ages by a goodly remnant to whom are to be ful-
 filled all the covenant promises,—this has been the theme of
  God's messengers to His church throughout the centuries
  that have passed."—Id., p. 22.
      "That which God purposed to do for the world through
  Israel, the chosen nation, He will finally accomplish through
  His church on earth to-day. He has 'let out His vineyard
  unto other husbandmen,' even to His covenant-keeping people,
  who faithfully 'render Him the fruits in their seasons.'
  Never has the Lord been without true representatives on this
  earth who have made His interests their own. These wit-
  nesses for God are numbered among spiritual Israel, and to
   them will be fulfilled all the covenant promises made by Je-
  hovah to His ancient people."—Id., pp. 713, 714.

                              Notes
   1. "Christ's follOwers have been redeemed for service.
Our Lord teaches that the true object of life is ministry.
Christ Himself was a worker, and to all His followers He
gives the law of service,—service 10. God and to their fellow
men."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 326.
    "In these final hours of probation for the sons of men,
when the fate of every soul is so soon to be decided forever, the
Lord of heaven and earth expects His church to arouse to
action as never before. Those who have been made free in
Christ through a knowledge of precious truth, are regarded
by the Lord Jesus as His chosen ones, favored above all other
people on the face of the earth; and He is counting on them to
show forth the praises of Him who hath called them out of
darkness into marvelous light. The blessings which are so
liberally bestowed, are to be communicated to others. The
good news of salvation is to go to every nation, kindred,
tongue, and people."—"Prophets and Kings," p. 716.
    2. "Jesus is our example. There are many who dwell with
interest upon the period of His public ministry, while they
pass unnoticed the teaching of His early years. But it is in
His home life that He is the pattern for all children and
youth."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 74.
    "Jesus was the healer of the body as well as of the soul.
He was interested in every phase of suffering that came under
His notice, and to every sufferer He brought relief, His kind
words having a soothing balm. None could say that He had
worked a miracle; but virtue—the healing power of love—
went out from Him to the sick and distressed. Thus in an
unobtrusive way He worked for the people from His very
childhood. And this was why, after His public ministry be-
gan, so many heard Him gladly."—Id., p. 92.
    3. "Of all His children to the close of time, no less than
of the first disciples, Christ said, 'As Thou host sent Me into
the world, even so have I also sent them into the world,; to be
 representatives of God, to reveal His Spirit, to manifest His
 character, to do His work."—"Ministry of Healing," pp.
395, 396.
   "Christ commits to His followers an individual work,—a
 work that cannot be done by proxy. Ministry to the sick and
 the poor, the giving of the gospel to the lost, is not to be left
 to committees or organized charities. Individual responsi-
22           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

bility, individual effort, personal sacrifice, is the requirement
of the gospel. . . . Through direct contact, through personal
ministry, the blessings of the gospel are to be communicated."
—Id., pp. 147, 148.
    4. "The greatest praise that men can bring to God is to
become consecrated channels through whom He can work.
Time is rapidly passing, into eternity. Let us not keep back
from God that which is His own. Let us not refuse Him that
which, though it cannot be given without merit, cannot be
denied without' ruin. He asks for a whole heart; give it to
Him; it is His, both by creation and by redemption. He asks
for your intellect; give it to Him; it is His. He asks for your
money; give it to Him; it is His.. 'Ye are not your own; for ye
are bought with a price.' God requires the homage of a sanc-
tified soul, which has prepared itself, by the exercise of the
faith that works by love, to serve Him. He holds up before
us the highest ideal, even perfection. He asks us to be ab-
solutely and completely for Him in this 'world as He is for
us in the presence of God."—"The. Acts of the. Apostles,"
p. 566.

    1. "Christ seldom gathered His disciples alone to receive
His words. He did not choose for His audience those only who
knew the way of life. It was His work to reach the multi-
tudes who were in ignorance and error. He gave His lessons
of truth where they could reach the darkened understanding."
-"The Desire of Ages," p. 298.
   2. "In the interview with Nicodemus, Jesus unfolded the
plan of salvation, and His mission to the world. In none of
His subsequent discourses did He exulaiit so fully, step by step,
the work necessary to be done in the hearts of all who would
inherit the kingdom of heaven."--/d., p. 176.
   3. "The Saviour did not wait for congregations to as-
semble. Often He began His lessons with only a few gathered
about Him, but one by one the passers-by paused to listen,
until a multitude heard with wonder and awe the words of
God through the heaven-sent Teacher. The worker for Christ
should not feel that he cannot speak with the same earnest-
ness to a few hearers as to a larger company. There may
be only one to hear the message; but who can tell how far-
reaching will be its influence?"-Id., p. 194.
    4. "He slept under their, roofs, ate with them at their
tables,-partaking of the food prepared and served by their
hands,-taught in their streets, and treated them with the
dtmost/kindness and courtesy."-M., p. 193.
24    '        SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
   "Jesus saw in every soul ene to whom must be given the
call to His kingdom. He reached the hearts of the people by
going among them as one who desired their good. He sought
them in the public streets, in private houses,- on the boats, in
the synagogue, by the shores of the lake, and at the marriage
feast. He met them at their daily vocations, and manifested
an interest in their secular affairs. He carried His instruc-
tion into the household, bringing families in their own homes
under the influence of His divine presence."—Id., p. 151.

                             Notes
   1. "For the carrying on of His work, Christ did not choose
the learning or eloquence of the Jewish Sanhedrin or the
power of Rome. Passing by the self-righteous Jewish-
teachers; the Master Worker chose humble, unlearned men to
proclaim the truths that were to move the world. . . . For
three years and a half the disciples were under the instruction
of the greatest Teacher the world has ever known. By per-
sonal contact and association, Christ trained them for His
service."—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 17.
    2. "These men He purposed to train and educate as the
leaders of His church. They in turn were to educate others,
and send them out with the gospel message. . . . It was at
the ordination of the twelve that the first step was taken in
the organization of the church that after Christ's departure
was to carry on His work on the earth."—Id., pp. 17, 18.
    3. "During the life of Christ, the sick and afflicted were
objects of His special care. When He sent out His disciples,
 He commissioned them to heal the sick as well as to preach
the gospel. . . . Their physical health was to be first cared
26          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

for, in order that the way might be prepared for their minds
 to be reached by those truths which the apostles were to
}reach. The Saviour of the world devoted more- time and
 labor to healing the afflicted of their maladies than to preach-
 ing. His last injunction to His apostles, His representatives
 upon the earth, was to lay hands on the sick that they might
 recover."—"Testimonies for the Church," vol. 4, p. 225.
     4. Most natural and most desirable does it seem that these
 chosen companions of the Master should seek to convey to
 Him the story of the wonderful power and miraculous results
 attending their efforts. He only could understand, and wisely.
 encourage or caution for future experience. True satisfac-
tion is always found in telling Jesus every detail of each day's
 experience in service, .and disciples to-day as of old may be
 sure of finding a restful retreat in the presence of the Saviour.
     5. "Be/fore ascending to heaven, Christ gave His disciples
 their commission. He told them that they were to be execu-
 tors of the will in which He bequeathed to the world the
 treasures of eternal life.""The Acts of the Apostles," p. 27.
     "In the trust given to the first disciples, believers in every
 age have shared. Every one who has received the gospel has
 been given sacred truth to impart to the world. God's faith-,
 ful people hive always been aggressive missionaries, conse-
 crating their resources to the honor of His name, and wisely
 using their talents in His service."—Id., p. 109.
     6. Aside from the Lord's Prayer, uttered in response to
 the request of the disciples that the Saviour teach them how
 to pray, the one specific thing for which Christ instructed His
 followers to pray was laborers to enter the harvest field.
     7. -,"So vast is the field, so comprehensive the design, that
'every sanctified heart will be pressed into service as an in-
 strument of diVine power."—"Testimonies for the Church,"
 vol. 9, p. 47.
     "Not more surely is the place prepared for us in the
 heavenly mansions than is the special place designated on
 earth where we are to work for God."—"Christ's Object Les-
 sons," p. 327.
     "Christ expects every man to do his duty; let this be the
 watchword throughout the ranks of His followers."—"Testi-
 monies for the Church," vol. 5, p. 460.
     "God calls upon every church member to enter His service.-
   . . Every one must learn to work, and to stand in his place
 as a burden-bearer. Every addition to the church should be
 one more agency for the carrying out of the great plan of
 redemption."-Id., vol. 8, p. 47.
     8. "Christ did riot tell His disciples that their work would
 be easy. He showed them the vast confederacy of evil
             SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                 27

arrayed against them. They would have to fight. 'against
principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the dark-
ness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high
places.' But they would not be left to fight alone. He as-
sured them that He would be with them; and that if they
would go forth in faith, they should move under the shield of
Omnipotence. He bade them be brave and strong; for One
mightier than angels would be in their ranks,—the General
of the armies of heaven. He made full provision for the prose-
cution of their work, and took upon Himself the responsi-
bility of its success. So long as they obeyed His word, and
worked in connection with Him, they could not fail. Go to all
nations, He bade them. Go to the farthest part of the habit-
able globe, and be assured that My presence will be with you
even there. Labor in faith and confidence; for the time will
never come when I will forsake you. I will be with you al-
ways, helping you to perform your duty, guiding, comforting,
sanctifying, sustaining you, giving you success in speaking
words that shall draw the attention of others to heaven."—

                           Notes
   1. "The disciples were to go forth as Christ's witnesses,
to declare to the world what they had seen and heard of Him.
Their office was the most important to which human beings
had ever been called, second only to that of Christ Himself.
They were to be workers together with God for the saving of
men. As in the Old Testament the twelve patriarchs stood as
representatives of Israel, so the twelve apostles stand as
representatives of the gospel church."-"The Acts of the
Apostles," p. 19.
    2. "Upon reaching the Mount of Olives, Jesus led the way
across the summit, to the vicinity of Bethany. Here • He
paused, and the disciples gathered about Him. Beams of
light seemed to radiate from His countenance as He looked
lovingly upon them. He upbraided them not for their faults
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  29

 and failures; words of the deepest tenderness were the last
 that fell upon their ears from the lips of their Lord. With
 hands outstretched in blessing, and as if in assurance of His
 protecting care, He slowly ascended from, among them, drawn
 heavenward by a power stronger than any earthly attraction.
 As he passed upward, the awe-stricken disciples looked with
 straining eyes for, the last glimpse of their ascending Lord.
 A cloud of glory hid Him from their sight; and the words
 came back to them as the cloudy chariot of angels received
 Him, `Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the ,
 world.' At the same time there floated down to them the
sweetest and most joyous music from the angel choir."—"The
 Desire of Ages," pp. 830, 831.
     3. "When the disciples went back to Jerusalem, the people
 looked upon them with amazement. After the trial and cruci-
 fixion of Christ, it had been thought that they would appear
 downcast and ashamed. Their enemies expected to see upon
 their faces an expression of sorrow and defeat. Instead of
 this there was only gladness and triumph. Their faces were
'aglow with a happiness not born of earth. They did not
 mourn over disappointed holies, but were full of praise and
 thanksgiving to God. . . . The disciples no longer had any
 distrust of the future. They knew that Jesus was in heaven,
 and that His sympathies were with them still. They knew
 that they had a friend at the throne of God, and they were
 eager to present their requests to the Father in the name
 of Jesus. In solemn awe they bowed in prayer, repeating
  the assurance, 'Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in My
  name, He will give it you. Hitherto have ye asked nothing in
 My name; ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may' be full.'
 They extended the hand of faith higher and higher, with the
  mighty argument, 'If is Christ that died, yea rather, that is
  risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also
  maketh intercession for us.' "—Id., pp. 832, 833.
      4. "Christ's ascension to heaven was the signal that His
  followers were to receive the promised blessing. For this
  they were to wait before they entered upon their work. When
  Christ passed within the heavenly gates, He was enthroned
  amidst the adoration of the angels. As soon as this ceremony
  was completed, the Holy Spirit descended upon the disciples
  in rich currents, and Christ was indeed glorified, even with
  the glory which He had with the Father from all eternity.
  The Pentecostal outpouring was Heaven's communication that
  the Redeemer's inauguration was accomplished."—"The Acts
  of the Apostles," pp. 38, 39.
      5. "In obedience to the word of their Master, the disciples.
   assembled in Jerusalem to wait for the fulfillment of God's
 30          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

  promise. Here they spent ten days,—days of deep heart-
  searching. They put away all differences, and drew close to-
  gether in Christian fellowship. At the end of ten days the
  Lord fulfilled His promise, by a wonderful outpouring of
  His Spirit."—"Testimonies for the Church," vol. 8, p. 15.
      "They did not wait in idleness. The record says that they
  were 'continually in the temple, praising and blessing God.'
  They also met together to present their requests to the Father
  in the name of Jesus."—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 35..
      6. Contrast the boldness with which Peter denounces the
  Jewish leaders, and the definite, clear-cut statements in which
  he portrays the divinity of the "Man of Galilee," whose be-
  nign presence had ever shed healing, blessing, and comfort
  upon the listeners, and of whose departure from earth to
  heaven he himself was eyewitness, with his conduct a few
  weeks previous, in the palace of the high priest. John 18:
  15-27. No marvel that the hearts of his hearers were
  "pricked" with a sense of astonishment and conviction. "The
  words of the apostles were as sharp arrows of the Almighty,
  convicting men of their terrible guilt in' rejecting and crucify-
  ing the Lord of glory."—Id., p. 45.
      The power of personal testimony vitalized by the Holy
  Spirit is invincible.
      7. "The disciples were astonished and overjoyed at the
  greatness of the harvest of souls. They did not regard this
  wonderful ingathering as the result of their own efforts; they
  realized that they were entering into other men's labors. Ever
  since the fall of Adam, Christ had been committing to chosen
  servants the seed of His word, to be sown in human hearts.
  During His life on this earth, He had sown the seed of truth,
  and had watered it with His blood. The conversions that took
  place on the Day of Pentecost were the result of this sowing,
  the harvest of Christ's work, revealing the power of His
  teaching."—Id., pp. 44, 45.
      Herein lies encouragement for the faithful seed-sower
  to whom results are obscure. During the latter rain, the
  harvest of much of this seed sowing will be manifest. "And
  let us not be weary in well-doing: for in due season we shall
  reap, if we faint not." Gal. 6: 9.
      8. "As the 'former rain' was given, in the outpouring of
  the Holy Spirit at the opening of the gospel, to cause the up-
  springing of the precious seed, so the 'latter rain' will be
  given at its close, for the ripening of the harvest."—"The
  Great Controversy," p. 611.
      "Why has the history of the work of the disciples, as they
• labored with holy zeal, animated and vitalized by the Holy
  Spirit, been recorded, if it is not that from this record the

Lord's people to-day are to gag.' an inspiration to work ear-
nestly for Him? What the Lord did for His people in that
time, it is just as essential, and more so, that He do for His
people to-day. All that the apostles did, every church,member
to-day is to do. And we are •to work with as much more
fervor, to be accompanied by the Holy Spirit in as much
greater measure, as the increase of wickedness demands a
more decided call to repentance. . . . From all believers light
is to be reflected in clear, distinct rays. . . . Should not the
power of God be even more mightily revealed to-day than in
the time of the apostles?"-"Testimonies for the _Church,"

                               Notes
    1. "As - He had sent out the twelve, so He 'appointed
seventy others, and sent them two and two before His face
into every city and place, whither He Himself was about to
come.' These disciples had been for some time with Him, in
training for their work. When the twelve were sent out on
their first separate mission, other disciples accompanied Jesus
in His journey through Gali  lee. - Thus they had the privilege
of intimate association with Hiin, and direct personal in-
struction. Now this larger number also were to go forth on
a separate mission."—"The Desire'of Ages," p. 488.
     2. "Like the apostles, the seventy had received super-
natural endowments as a seal of their mission."—Id., p. 490.
     "When He sent forth the seventy, He commanded them to
heal the sick, and next to preach that the kingdom of God had
come nigh unto them."— 'Testimonies for the Church," vol.
4, P. 225.
     3. Notice that little word "all." It must never be omitted.
They were all with one accord, and they were all in one
place; the Spirit sat upon each of them; and they were all
filled with the Holy Ghost.
     4. "All scattered abroad, . . . except the apostles." It
would therefore seem that one of the results of the outpour-
 ing of the Holy Spirit was the sending forth of a great army
of men and women, who pioneered the way for the gospel into
every city of the heathen world.
     5. "Among those to whom the Saviour had given the com-
 mission, 'Go ye therefore, and teach all nations,' were many
 from the humbler walks of life,—men and women who had
 learned to love their Lord, and who had determined to follow
 His example of unselfish service. To these lowly ones, as well
 as to the disciples who had been with the Saviour during His
earthly ministry, had been giien a precious trust. They were
 to carry to the world the glad tidings of salvation through
 Christ. When they were scattered by persecution, they went
 forth filled with missionary zeal. . . . The Lord wrought
 through them. Wherever they went, the sick were healed, and
 the poor had the gospel preached unto them."—"The Acts of
 the Apostles," pp. 105, 106.
      6. "The time had come, the apostles stated, when the
 spiritual leaders having the oversight of the church should be
 relieved from the task of distributing to the poor and fforn
 similar burdens, so that they might be free to carry forward
 the work of preaching the gospel. . . . The appointment of
  the seven to take the oversight of special lines of work, proved
  a great blessing to the church."—Id., p. 89.
34         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

 . "The fact that these brethren had been ordained for the
special work of looking after the needs of the poor, did not
exclude them from teaching the faith. On the contrary, they
were fully qualified to instruct others in the truth, and they
engaged in the work with great earnestness and success."—
Id., p. 90.                  •
    7. As Stephen was the first Christian martyr, so it was
Philip the deacon who was •the first foreign missionary in
apostolic times,—going "down to the city of Samaria" to
preach the Word, in advance of the apostles.
    8. "Christ's message to the Samaritan woman with whom
He had talked at Jacob's well, had borne fruit. . . . And
when His disciples were driven from Jerusalem, some found
in Samaria a safe asylum. The Samaritans welcomed these
messengers of the gospel, and the Jewish converts gathered
a precious harvest from among those who had once been their
bitterest enemies."—Id., pp. 106, 107.

                                Notes
     1. These disciples were doubtless Hellenist Jews—Jews'
residing in foreign lands who spoke the Greek language.
 They traveled as far as Antioch, which was the third city of
importance in the Roman empire. They anticipated the needs
of that great heathen city, and courageously• advanced into
this difficult heathen mission field, hundreds of miles in ad-
 vance of any of the apostles. They were the first to preach
the gospel to the Greeks, and the record says that "a great
 number believed, and turned unto the Lord." While these
 early disciples were pioneering their way into this advance
mission field, the apostle Peter was learning the lesson con-
 cerning the divine provision for the gentile world, through
 the thrice repeated vision on the housetop. Antioch became
 the center for missionary operations in the heathen world,
 and it was here that the believers were, first called "Chris-
 tians."
36          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

    2. "God had abundantly blessed the labors of Paul and
Barnabas during the year they remained with the believers
in Antioch. But neither of them had as yet been formally
ordained to the gospel ministry. They had now reached a
point in their Christian experience when God was about to
intrust them with the carrying forward of a difficult mis-
sionary enterprise, in the prosecution of which they would
need every advantage that could be obtained through the
agency of the church."—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 160.
    3. That Dorcas was a friend to the widow and the father-
less, the tears shed and the garments exhibited in that upper
chamber at Joppa give full proof. The divine recognition of
her service in the miracle of calling her from the sleep of
death, should rest as a benediction upon such ministry
through all succeeding history of the church. Christians
throughout the world should perpetuate the name of Dorcas
by following her noble example.
    4. The church in Rome cannot claim as its founder a Peter
or a Paul. This church was doubtless raised up through the
efforts of the disciples of the Pentecostal experience. Paul
wrote his epistle to the church at Rome some two or three
years before he reached there in person. In that epistle, he
makes mention of the fact that their "faith is spoken of
throughout the whole world," and also assures them that
"oftentimes I purposed to come unto you," but explains that
he was prevented from doing so, and states that he longed
to see them. Two years later he was permitted to go to Rome.
but he was a prisoner in chains. We are told that the brethren
of the church at Rome went out to meet Paul, coming as far
as "Appii Forum, and the three taverns: whom when Paul
saw, he thanked God, and took courage." We can but faintly
comprehend what this meant to Paul—an aged man, a
prisoner o the Lord Jesus, as he received this cordial greet-
ing from these faithful disciples, who were strangers in face
and form, but to whom he was firmly attached by the bonds
of Christian love and fellowship, and whose faith and good
works he had found so well spoken of throughout the world.
    5. Twenty-eight men and women who were zealous in Chris-
tian service in the early history of the church are here men;
tioned by name, and this number would be greatly increased
if we knew the names of the "household" of Aristobulus and
Narcissus, and the "brethren" and the "saints" referred to in
verses 14 and 15. It is a great honor to have one's name re-
corded in Holy Writ for faithful service; but it is a still
greater privilege to have the name recorded in "the book of
life" with the history "according to their works." Rev. 20: 12.
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     37

    6. "Why has the history of the work of the disciples, as
they labored with holy zeal, animated and vitalized by the Holy
 Spirit, been recorded, if it is not that from this record the
 Lord's people to-day are to gain an inspiration to work ear-
 nestly for Him?"—"Testimonies for the Church," vol. 7, p. 33.
     "As the disciples, filled with the power of the Spirit, went
 forth to proclaim the gospel, so God's servants are to go forth
 to-day. Filled with an unselfish desire to give the message of
 mercy to those who are in the darkness of error and unbelief,
 we are to take up the Lord's work."—Id., p. 32.
     7. "God's church is the court of holy life, filled with varied
'gifts, and endowed with the Holy Spirit. The members are
 to find their happiness in the happiness of those whom they
 help and bless. Wonderful is the work which the Lord de-
 signs to accomplish through His church, that His name may
 be glorified. ' A picture of this work is given in Ezekiel's
 vision of the river of healing."—"The Acts of the Apostles,"
 pp. 12, 13.

                              Notes
    1. Here is brought to view the missionary arena of the
world. " The price has been paid, salvation is free; but with-
out the proclamation of the glad news to every captive in
the bondage of sin, in a manner suited to his comprehension
and appealing to his endorsement and ready acceptance, he
cannot call upon the name of the Lord and be saved. Belief
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                 39

must be established by hearing the word of God; but "how
shall they hear without a preacher?" While the call for
preachers is imperative, and will receive an adequate re-
sponse, there is the still further call to make the response
effective—"How shall they preach, except they be sent?"
Those who preach, and those who furnish the necessary means
to send the preacher on his mission, are alike :helping to bring
an end to sin, and the realization of redemption.
     2. "Go, ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to
every creature," is the commission that Jesus gave to the
members of His church. "God's people are not to cease their
labors until they shall encircle the world."—"Testimonies for
the Church," vol. 6, p. 24.
     3. "Hundreds, yea, thousands, who have heard the mes-
sage of salvation, are still idlers in. the market place, when
they might be engaged in some line of active service. To
these Christ s saying, 'Why stand ye here all the day idle?'
and He adds, 'Go ye also into the vineyard.' Why is it that
many more do not respond to the call? Is it because they think
themselves excused in that they do not stand in the pulpit?
 Let them understand that there is a large work to be done
 outside the pulpit, by thousands of consecrated lay members.
 Long has God waited for the spirit of service to take pos-
 session of the whole church, so that every one shall be work-
 ing for Him according to his ability. When the members of
 the church of God do their appointed work in the needy fields
 at home and abroad, in fulfillment of the gospel commission,
 the whole world will soon be warned, and the Lord Jesus will
 return to this earth with power and great glory."—"The Acts
 of the Apostles," pp. 110, 111.
     4. The eleventh hour is quickly followed by the evening
 glow of setting sun, when the work of the toilers must cease,
 and the laborers receive their reward. There is no further
 call to the vineyard. Those who respond to the eleventh-hour
 call share equally in the reward with those who have borne
 the burden and heat of the day. To be permitted to enter thee
 vineyard at the present stage of earth's history is a privilege
 indeed.
      5. "There is work for every one of us in the vineyard of
 the Lord."—"Testimonies for the Church," vol. 5, p. 386.
      "Every one who stands as an idler in the vineyard of the
 Lord is not merely doing nothing himself, but he is a hin-
  drance to those who are trying to work."—Id., p. 394.
      "To every one who becomes a partaker of His grace, the
  Lord appoints a work for others. . . . It is our work to re-
 veal to men the gospel of their salvation. Every enterprise in
  which we engage should be a means to this end."—"Ministry
  of healing," p. 148.
40           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

    "Every one who is added to the ranks by conversion is to
be assigned his post of duty."—"Testimonies for the Church,"
vol. 7, p. 30.
    6."Those who take up their appointed work will not only
be a blessing to others, but they will themselves be blessed.
The consciousness ofuty well done will have a 'reflex in-
fluence upon their owh souls. The despondent will forget
their despondency, the weak will become strong, the ignorant
intelligent, and all will find an unfailing helper in Him who
has called them."—"Ministry of Healing," p. 148. •
     7. "The redeemed will meet and recognize those whose at-
tention they have directed to the uplifted Saviour. What
blessed converse they will have with these souls! 'I was a
sinner,' it will be said, 'without God and without hope in the
world; and you came to me, and drew my attention to the
precious Saviour as my only hope. And I believed in Him. I
repented of my sins, and was made to sit together with His
saints in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.' . . . Others will
express their gratitude to those who fed the• hungry and
clothed the naked. 'When despair bound my soul in unbelief,
the Lord sent you to me,' they say, 'to speak words of hope
and comfort. You brought me food for my physical' neces-
sities, and you opened to me the word of God, awakening me
to my spiritual needs. . . . I became hungry for the bread
of life, and the truth was precious to my soul. I am here,
saved, eternally saved, ever to- live in His presence, and to
praise Him who gave His life for me.' "—"Gospel Workers,"
 pp. 518, 519.
