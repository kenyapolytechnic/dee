   THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
              March 25
      The Transportation, Outfitting, and Establishment of the
           i922 Missionaries in their Mission Stations,
                       including Homes
                    VITAMINES
A    SUBJECT which concerns every one is that of a proper
     diet. "Foods are substances which, when taken into the
body, supply the necessary elements for promoting growth,
repairing its broken-down tissue, and furnishing it with heat
and power for muscular work. True foods contain the same
elements as are found in the human body, and thus they are
able to build and maintain the body structure."
    "In the past, it has been customary to express the value
of a diet largely in terms of heat units, or calories, since it
was supposed that the value of foods depended largely, if
not entirely, upon the amount of heat produced from the
consumption of their so-called nutritive constituents." ("The
Science of Food and Cookery," pages 11, 26.)
    The recent discoveries of the food laboratories, however,
show that the vitamines are the most essential to our well-
being and even our lives, for the absence of food vitamines
makes life impossible. How important, then, that we have a
knowledge of food values and their proper combination!
    In his book "The Science of Food and Cookery," Mr. H. S.
Anderson, dietitian and food expert at the medical college
and sanitarium at Loma Linda, has given us a most compre-
hensive and instructive statement of facts regarding foods,
their nutritive values, and their proper combinations for the
daily diet, in the light of these recent discoveries, as well as
an excellent cookbook of over five hundred recipes.
    The following chapter titles give but a slight idea of the
broad scope of the book: Foods, Their Uses in the Body; The
Vital Elements in Foods (Vitamines) ; Food Minerals Essen-
tial to All Life; Natural Food of Man; Balancing the Food;
 Food Economics; Cookery and Food Preparation; Principles
 of Successful Cookery; Food Combinations; Dietetic Errors;
 Planning the Meal and Menu Making; Course of Cooking Les-
 sons; Bread; Soups; Entrées and Noon-Meal Dishes; Gravies
 and Sauces; Vegetables; Salads and Dressings; Desserts;
 Toasts, Breakfast Dishes, Cereals, Eggs, Sandwiches; Cook-
 ery for the Sick; Diet in Disease; Fruit Ices, Ice Cream,
 Sherbets; Principles of Canning and Preserving; Miscellane-
 ous Recipes; Warmed-Over Dishes; Wheat Flour and Sugar
 Substitutes.
     "The Science of Food and Cookery" is a book that should
 be in every Seventh-day Adventist home, as a most valuable
 aid in the practice of true health principles. It contains 282
 pages, printed in large, clear type, with illustrations and
 especially drawn chapter and page headings, on a good grade
 of heavy paper, and bound in an attractively printed, durable
 cloth cover, which is waterproof and easily cleaned. The
 price is but $1.50, postpaid. (In Canada, $1.80.)

                             Notes
    1. "Wonderful in its significance is the brief record of His
early life: 'The child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled
with wisdom; and the grace of God was upon Him.' In the
sunlight of His Father's countenance, Jesus 'increased in
wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.' His
mind was active and penetrating, with a thoughtfulness and
wisdom beyond His years. Yet His character was beautiful
in its symmetry. The powers of mind and body developed
gradually, in keeping with the laws of childhood. . . .
    ".With deep earnestness the mother of Jesus watched the
                        ,
unfolding of His powers and beheld the impress of perfection
upon His character. With delight she sought to encourage
that bright, receptive mind. Through the Holy Spirit she re-
ceived wisdom to cooperate with the heavenly agencies in the
development of this child, who could claim only God as His
Father."—"The Desire of Ages," pp. 68, 69.
    2. "The child Jesus did not receive instruction in the syna-
gogue schools. His mother was His first human teacher.
 From her lips and from the scrolls of the prophets, He learned
of heavenly things. The very words which He Himself had
spoken to Moses for Israel, He was now taught at His
mother's knee. As He advanced from childhood to youth, He
did not seek the schools of the rabbis. He needed not the edu-
 cation to be obtained from such sources; for God was His
 instructor."—Id., pp. 69, 70.
6           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON. QUARTERLY

    3. These words were not spoken in sincerity, but were full
of flattery and praise intended to lead Jesus to make state-
ments'for which He could be condemned for either heresy or
treason. But while spoken to deceive and ensnare, they bore a
truthful testimony of the Saviour.
    4. These words from Nicodemus, the Pharisee, resemble
very much those addressed to Christ in Luke 20: 21, but they
came from a sincere heart. Jesus discerned this as He dis-
cerned the other, and shaped His reply to meet the needs of
each.
    5. "The teaching of the scribes and elders was cold and
formal, like a lesson learned by rote. To them the word of
God possessed no vital power. Their own ideas and traditions
were substituted for its teaching. In the accustomed round
of service they professed to explain the law, but no inspira-
tion from God stirred their own hearts or the hearts of their
hearers. . .
    "Jesus met the people on their own ground, as one who
was acquainted with their perplexities. He made truth
beautiful by presenting it in the most direct and simple way.
His language was pure, refined, and clear as a running
stream. His voice was as music to those who had listened to
the monotonous tones of the rabbis. But while His teaching
was simple, He spoke as one having authority. This charac-
teristic set His teaching in contrast with that of all others.
The rabbis spoke with doubt and hesitancy, as if the Scrip-
tures might be interpreted to mean one thing or exactly the
opposite. The hearers were daily involved in greater un-
certainty. But Jesus taught the Scriptures as of unquestion-
able authority. Whatever His subject, it was presented with
power, as if His words could not be controverted."—Id., p. 253.
    6. Those who read the Gospels carefully must note the
extensive limits to which Jesus traveled in Palestine while
teaching the people. During His ministry, He made eight
complete circuits of Galilee. More than once we find Him in
Samaria and Judea and Perea. He journeyed as far north
as parts of Cmsarea Philippi, and we also find Him in the coasts
of Tyre and Sidon. He was sent to the lost sheep of the house
of Israel (Matt. 15: 24; Acts 3: 25, 26) ; and it was His pur-
pose evidently to reach as many as possible of this nation to
which He was specially sent, before His earthly career should
close in death. If they were reached at all, He must go to the
cities and villages in which they lived, and press the claims
of the gospel home to their hearts and consciences.

18. For what purpose do we need alight? Verse 15. Note 7.
19. For what purpose does God give to us the light of truth?
       Verse 16.
                             Notes
      1. "In the sermon on the mount, He [Christ] sought to
  undo the work that had been wrought by false education, and
  to give His hearers a right conception of His kingdom and of
  His own character. . . . Without combating their ideas of
  the kingdom of God, He told them the conditions of entrance
  therein, leaving them to draw their own conclusions as to its
  nature. The truths He taught are no less important to us
  than to the multitude that followed Him. We no less than
  they need to learn the foundation principles of the kingdom of
  God."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 299.
      2. The terns "Beatitudes," by which we designate the nine
  "blesseds" of this chapter, comes from the Latin beati, the
  word with which these verses begin in that version. Jesus
  does not say "happy," but "blessed." There is a difference.
  Happiness may depend upon surroundings and circumstances,
  but blessedness depends on relationship to God. We should
  bear in mind that these "blesseds" are not pronounced alone
  upon those already possessing these virtues, but also upon
  those who, by grace, may acquire them. Luke says, "Blessed
  are ye poor"—poor in this world's goods, but possessing God,
  and growing in grace and knowledge in Him. Such are in-
  deed blessed.
      3. "Jesus places meekness among the first qualifications
  for His kingdom. .In His own life and character the divine
  beauty of this precious grace is revealed. . . . Human nature
  is ever struggling for expression, ready for contest; but he
  who learns of Christ is emptied of self, of pride, of love of su-
  premacy, and there is silence in the soul. Self is yielded to the
  disposal of the Holy Spirit. Then we are not anxious to
• have the highest place. We have no ambition to crowd and
  elbow ourselves into notice; but we feel that our highest
  place is at the feet of our Saviour. . . . The meekness of
  Christ, manifested in the home, will make the inmates happy;
  it provokes no quarrel, gives back no angry answer, but
  soothes the irritated temper, and diffuses a gentleness that is
  felt by all within its charmed circle. Wherever cherished, it
  makes the families of earth a part of the one great family
  above."—"Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing," pp. 29-32,
  current edition.
      "The meek are the self-controlled. The virtue of meekness
  is far from being a passive one. Only a strong person can be
  a truly meek person. . . . A meek man is a tamed man, one
In the Sermon on the Mount, Christ sought to undo the work that had been wrought by
                                    false education.
10          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

who has himself in perfect control under all and every provo-
cation. A meek man does not lack force and fire and power,
but he controls these good qualities and uses them for right
things. The Jews were looking forward to inheriting the
earth in a literal. sense; when the Messiah should come they
expected their land to rule all lands. How strange it must
have sounded to the disciples to hear Jesus proclaim that the
meek shall inherit the earth, to hear such a reward promised
to a virtue, not to a deed!"—Tarbell.
    4. Hunger and thirst are the normal manifestations of
physical health. These strong feelings are used to illustrate
the eager desire the soul should have for righteousness.
    "The invalid loses desire for food, but with returning
health begins to desire and enjoy it. So it is also in the moral
and spiritual realm. Hunger for the highest, for the best and
truest life, is itself a sign of saving relationship with God.
The man who has no hunger, and is conscious of no needs, has
neither knowledge of himself nor of God."—Id.
    5. Peacemakers should not wait until contending parties
resort to open conflict. It is well to discern early the causes
that lead up to an open break, and take steps to avert the
trouble. We may be peacemakers in name, but at the , same
time possess dispositions that are the source of constant
strife and turmoil. A 'quarrelsome, fretful, faultfinding,
criticizing, gossiping disposition is not calculated to bring the
blessing in store for peacemakers.
    6. "I have often seen just such salt, and the identical
disposition of it that our Lord has mentioned. A merchant
of Sidon having farmed of the government the revenue from
the importation of salt, brought over an immense quantity
from the marshes of Cyprus. . . . This he had transferred
to the mountains, to cheat the government out of some small
percentage. Sixty-five houses . . . were .rented and filled
with-salt. These houses have merely earthen floors, and the
salt next to the ground, in a few years, entirely spoiled. I
saw large quantities of it literally thrown into the street, to
be trodden underfoot of men and beasts. . . . It is not only
good for nothing itself, but it actually destroys all fertility
wherever it is thrown ; and this is the reason why it is cast
into the street. . . . There is no place about the house, yard,
or garden where it can be tolerated. No man will allow it to
be thrown on to his field, and the only place for it is the street;
and there it is cast, to be trodden underfoot of men."—
 W. M. Thompson, in "The Land and the Book."
       7. Lord, let me be the torch that springs to light,
           And lives its life in one exultant flame,
          A blaze of living fire against, the night,
           Although :t drop to darkness without fame.
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   11
       For I have watched the smoldering, lukewarm soul,
        Choked in the ashes that itself hath made,
       Despised the grudging measures of its dole,
         And turned from it bewildered and afraid.
        Light rue with light of love - this my desire -
          With light of love, I pray! Then let me burn
        My little moment in pulsating fire,
          And so perform my mission in my turn.
        Let me be lighthouse for some rock or reef,
         Shining afar to light a soul's return,
        That it be saved from shipwreck, loss, and grief.
         Make me Thy torch, 0 Lord, to brightly burn.

16. What high standard is set before every Christian?
        Verse 48.
                              Notes
    1. That Jesus referred to the great moral law is shown
in His reference to two of its commandments. See Matt. 5:
21, 27. He came not to destroy the law, nor the prophets
which His Spirit had inspired. 1 Peter 1: 11. He came to
"fulfill" the law. The only way a moral law can be fulftlled
is by keeping it to the full. John 15: 10; Gal. 6: 2. Thus
Jesus kept the law of God, and then, in His love, died to meet
its claims, that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled
in His followers. Rom. 8: 4. He fulfilled the prophecies re-
lating to His first advent. Eternity alone can fulfill all the
prophecies, for some of them prophesy of the eternal kingdom
of God.
    2. A "jot" (the Hebrew letter yod, answering to our
letter i) is the smallest letter of the Hebrew alphabet. A
"tittle" is a point that serves to distinguish one letter from
another, as the difference between our capital E and F. Some
Hebrew letters are much more alike, and the absence or
presence of the distinguishing point would make great dif-
ference in the meaning. God's law could not be changed in
one jot or tittle till heaven and earth should pass away; and
"the earth abideth forever."
    3. " 'Shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven.'
That is, he shall have no place therein. For he who willfully
breaks one commandment, does not, in spirit and truth, keep
any of them."—"Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing," p. 81,
current edition.
    In the Judgment, those persons who break God's law and
teach men to do so, will be counted "of no esteem in the king-
dom of heaven." They will have no place there.
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   13

    4. The nature of God's law, and its meaning, have never
changed. The meaning which Christ caused to stand out with
clear emphasis was in the law as 'spoken from Mount Sinai.
But the traditions of its teachers had covered up the true
meaning. Christ purposed to take away this false interpre-
tation, and cause the law to stand out in its true interpre-
tation.
    5. "When one who professes to serve God wrongs or in-
jures a brother, he misrepresents the character of God to that
brother, and the wrong must be confessed, he must acknowl-
edge it to be sin, in order to be in harmony with God. ' Our
brother may have done us a greater wrong than we have done
him, but this does not lessen our responsibility. If when we
come before God we remember that another has aught against
us, we are to leave our gift of prayer, of thanksgiving, of
freewill offering, and go to the brother with whom we are at
variance, and in humility confess our own sin, and ask to be
forgiven."-f---/d., pp. 91, 92.
    6. "In order for us to reach this high ideal, that which
causes the soul to stumble must be sacrificed. It is through
the will that sin retains its hold upon us. The surrender
of the will is represented as plucking out the eye or cutting off
the hand. Often it seems to us that to surrender the will to
God is to consent to go through life maimed or crippled.
 But it is better, says Christ, for self to be maimed, wounded,
crippled, if thus you may enter into life. That which you
 look upon as disaster is the door to highest benefit."—Id.,
 pp. 95, 96.                          •
    7. "Our Saviour did not, however, forbid the use of the
 judicial oath, in which God is solemnly called to witness that
what is said is truth, and nothing but the truth. Jesus Him-
self, at His trial before the Sanhedrin, did not refuse to tes-
tify under oath. . . . If there is any one who can consistently
testify under oath, it is the Christian.""—Id., p. 103.
   8. "But let your speech be, Yea, yea:, Nay, nay: and what-
 soever is more than these is of the evil one." A. R. V. The
context shows the admonition to be against unnecessary oaths.
 There are those who are so anxious to make their words
 emphatic, that they use all kinds of adjurations.


   "Its is impossible to estimate the good results of one hour
or even,half an hour each day devoted in a cheerful, social
manner to the word of God."—Mrs. E. G. White, in "Testi-
monies on Sabbath School Work."

16. What instruction is given concerning fasting? Verses
       17, 18. Note 4.
                             Notes
   1. "In the secret place of prayer, where no eye but God's
can see, no ear but His can hear, we may pour out our most
hidden desires and longings to the Father of 'infinite pity;
and in the hush and silence of the soul, that voice which never
fails to answer the cry of human need, will speak to
our hearts."—"Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing," p.
126, current edition.
   2. Study well the instruction of our Saviour, and the
prayers recorded in the Scripture. This passage does not
forbid public prayer; for our Lord prayed in public, as did
His servants. Public prayers, should on all ordinary occasions
be short. Let the long prayers be in secret. Come to God
with humility, with a sense of utter unworthiness, and of His
holiness and mercy. Thank Him for His goodness. Praise
Him for His love and mercy. Ask in simple faith as we need,
but always according to His will. Do not often repeat the
name or titles of Deity, nor speak to the great God as you
would to your human neighbor. Holy reverence becomes the
Christian; and this is fitting to the most implicit faith.
   3. A story is told of a knight in olden times who went to
an aged pastor to ask his blessing before he went to avenge
himself on his enemy. The pastor said, "Son, on one condi-
tion I bestow my blessing; kneel and pray with all thy heart
our Lord's prayer after me." The knight did so until he
came to the petition for forgiveness, and then paused. The
good man bade him continue. The knight said he could not.
"Then," said the aged man, "I cannot bestow my blessing."
Again and again the old man repeated the prayer, and the
knight followed him until he came to that petition. Finally
the words broke his heart, and he followed the prayer clear
through. "Now, my son," said his counselor, "I will bless thee
on thy mission."       have none," replied the knight; "I have
no enemy to avenge."
    4. "Anoint thine head, and wash thy face,—these were
forbidden in the Jewish canon on days of fasting and humilia-
tion; and hypocrites availed themselves of this ordinance that
they might appear to fast. Our Lord, therefore, cautions us
against this; as if He had said, Ar        .iothing, dress in any
ordinary manner, and let the whole of thy deportment prove
that thou desirest to recommend thy soul to God, and not thy
face to men."—Clarke.

   Money is of no more value than sand, only as it• is put to
use in providing for the necessities of life, in blessing others,
and advancing the cause of Christ."—"Christ's Object Les-
sons," p. .951.

16. In undertaking to teach others, what should we first do?
        Verses 4, 5.
                               Notes
     1. The single, clear eye gives correct ideas. The perverted
 eye distorts all outward things to the dark body. So, if our
 spiritual vision is single (seeking only God's glory), His light
 will flood the soul and enlighten the dark body. But if this
 vision is perverted by sin and selfishness, it will further per-
 vert the naturally base passions.
     2. The injunction is not an excuse for laziness, shiftless-
 ness, thoughtlessness. "Take no anxious thought," is the
 idea of the text. God demands prudence, industry, care, in
 His service; but having done your duty in His fear and by
 His grace, do not worry. Leave the results to Him.
     3. "All who have chosen God's service are to rest in His
 care. Christ pointed to the birds flying in the heavens, to the
 flowers of the field, and bade His hearers consider these ob-
 jects of God's creation. 'Are ye not of much more value than
 they?' He said. The measure of divine attention bestowed on
 any object is proportionate to its rank in the scale of being.
'The little brown sparrow is watched over by Providence. The
 flowers of the field, the grass that carpets the earth, share the
 notice and care of our heavenly Father. The great Master
 Artist has taken thought for the lilies, making them so beauti-
 ful that they outshine the glory of. Solomon. How much more
 does He care for man, who is the image and glory of God. He
 longs to see His children reveal a character after His simili-
 tude. As the sunbeam imparts to the flowers their varied and
 delicate tints, so does God impart to the soul the beauty of
 His own character."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 313.
     4. Perhaps one of the most common sins we commit is that
 of judging one another. God has not given this duty to man,
 except in matters of civil relationships. To presume to judge
 is to arrogate to ourselves the ability to read the mind and
 heart, to weigh the, motives, and to balance correctly the
  thoughts and intents of the heart. God alone is able to do this,
  and this prerogative He has reserved to Himself, to be exe-
 cuted at the time when all the mysteries of light and darkness
  shall be made manifest. 1 Cor. 4: 5. We should be careful
  that we do not put ourselves in the place of God by passing
  judgment upon one another.
 , 5. "Do not set yourself up as a standard. Do not make
  your opinions, your views of duty, your interpretations of
  Scripture, a criterion for others, and in your heart condemn
  them if they do not come up to your ideal. Do not criticize
  others, conjecturing as to their motives, and passing judg-
  ment upon them. . . . Those who condemn or criticize others,
  proclaim themselves guilty; for they do the same things. In
18          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

condemning others, they are passing sentence upon them-
selves, and God declares that this sentence is just. He accepts
their own verdict against themselves. . . . Christ is the only
true standard of character, and he who sets himself up as a
standard for others, is putting himself in the place of Christ."

12. What reply will the Lord make to such claims? Verse

13. To whom does Jesus liken the obedient hearer of His say-

14. To whom does He liken the disobedient hearer? Verses
      26, 27.
15. How did the teachings of Jesus affect the people? Why
      were they astonished? Verses 28, 29. Note 5.
                               Notes
    1. "Ask," "seek," "knock." Be in earnest. Many pause
on the very threshold of blessing and deliverance. God does
not wish to see His children in need, and if we will but place
our needs before Him and ask for help, He will help us.
    2. Instead of saying that the Lord will give good things
to them that ask Him, Luke says (Luke 11: 13) that He will
give His Holy Spirit, which "brings all other blessings in its
train." We must yield all in order to receive this blessing.
We must make room in our hearts and lives for the fullness
of the Spirit. Then the love of God will be shed abroad in
our hearts. Rom. 5: 5. •
    3. "Strait" is used in the sense of "narrow" in both verses.
The gate does not open to the pilgrim laden with selfishness,
worldliness, riches, sin. All these must be left without. As
long as we cling to such things, we cannot enter the narrow
gate, whatever we may profess to the contrary.
    4. "I never knew you." Awful words will they be in the
final judgment! Jesus Christ is not the minister of sin. He
came to save from sin, not in sin. He died to "redeem us
from all iniquity [lawlessness, law-breaking], and purify unto
Himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works." Titus 2:
14. It cannot be too strongly emphasized that faith in Christ
leads to cleansing from sin, clean living, and righteous doing.
    5. "Having authority." The scribes built their teachings
on the traditions of men. Jesus came with a mission, a mes-
sage, to save men; and the words He spoke were spirit and
life. As the Father sent Him, so has He sent others.. If we
are His heralds, we have His message. And in that message
is authority and power. He would not have His servants
frightened from the positiveness of the message by the cry of
"dogmatic," or the insolence of tradition, or the sneer of
"learned" philosophical critics. "Preach the word; be instant
in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-
suffering and doctrine." 2 Tim. 4: 2.

                              Notes
     1. "After the Assyrians conquered Samaria, the Israelite
 inhabitants were taken to Babylonia, and colonists were
 brought from Babylonia to occupy their place in Samaria. At
 the time of Christ, the Jews regarded the Samaritans as of
 purely heathen origin, descendants of those Babylonians; but
 the Samaritans claimed that not all the Jews had been driven
 from Samaria at the captivity, and that through intermar-
 riage there was in their veins an admixture of Jewish blood,
 of the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh."—Tarben.
     When the tribe of Judah returned from captivity, these
 people desired to join with them in building the temple at Je-
 rusalem, but were refused. Ezra 4: 3. The Samaritans in
 Consequence built a rival temple on Mount Gerizim. Strong
 enmity sprang up. Greater holiness was claimed for Mount
 Gerizim than for Jerusalem; the Samaritans accused the Jews
 of corrupting God's word. On the other hand, the Jews called
 the Samaritans Cuthites, and forbade all intercourse with
 them; to receive one into the house was thought to bring down
 the curse of God.
     2. Note how carefully the Saviour led the mind of the
 woman, not only to confess, voluntarily her sinfulness, but to
 ask questions for the enlightenment of her darkened mind. He
 precipitated nothing, but let her open the way for the line of
 truth she sought to receive.
     "The Syriac Codex implies that Jesus rose and stood to
 meet politely the standing woman, and this standing was one
 thing that caused His disciples to marvel."—Peloubet.
     3. The Jews had imbibed to an extent the Oriental idea of
  restricting woman's sphere. For a rabbi to speak to a woman
  publicly was highly indecent. The Talmud forbade it, even
•though the woman was the rabbi's own wife. He could not
 even greet her courteously.

                             Notes
    1. "They did not seek Him from any worthy motive; but
as they had been fed with the loaves, they hoped still to re-
ceive temporal benefit by attaching themselves to Him. The
Saviour bade them, 'Labor not for the meat which perisheth,
but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life.' "—
"The Desire of Ages," p. 38k.
    2. Their argument, in asking for a sign that they might
believe in Jesus, was this: Moses proved that he was sent
from God by giving the people bread from heaven to eat; now
what do you do that is greater than this to prove that you are
the greater prophet, the Messiah, who will deliver us from
our bondage to the Romans, as Moses delivered our fathers
from the Egyptians? You have fed five thousand with five
loaves from the earth for one meal. Moses fed millions for
forty years with breat from heaven.
    3. "This figure of speech means more to Orientals than it
does to us, for bread is to all save the rich the very staff of
life, almost the sole article of diet. 'As the son of a Syrian
family,' writes Abraham Mitrie Rihbany, 'I was brought up
to think of bread as possessing a mystic,,sacred significance.
I never would step on a piece of bread fallen on the road, but
would pick it up, press it to my lips for reverence, and place
it on a wall or someother place where it would not be trodden
upon. What always seemed to me one of the noblest tradi-
tions of my people was their reverence for the wish, bread;
24          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
literally, "the life-giver." The wish was something more than
mere matter. Inasmuch as it sustained life, it was God's own
life made tangible for His child, man, to feed upon. The Mok
High Himself fed our hunger.' "—Tarbell.
    4. "To eat the flesh and drink the blood of Christ is to re-
ceive Him as a personal Saviour, believing that He forgives
our sins, and that we are complete in Him. It is by beholding
His love, by dwelling upon it, by drinking it in, that we are
to become partakers of His nature: What food is to the body,
Christ must be to the soul. Food cannot benefit us unless we
eat it; unless it becomes a part of our being. So Christ is of
no value to us if we do not know. Him as a personal Saviour.
A theoretical knowledge will do us no good. We must feed
upon Him, receive Him into the heart, so that His life be-
comes our life. His love, His grace, must be assimilated."—
"The Desire of Ages," p. 389.
    5. "By the public rebuke of their unbelief these disciples
were still further alienated from Jesus. They were greatly
displeased, and wishing to wound the Saviour, and gratify
the malice of the Pharisees, they turned their backs upon
Him, and left Him with disdain. They had made their
choice,—had taken the form without the spirit, the husk
without the kernel. Their decision was never afterward re-
versed; for they walked no more with Jesus."—/d., p. 392.

                            Notes
    1. "The beautiful pastoral symbolism of our Lord's dis-
course runs through the first eighteen verses of this tenth
chapter of John. It has been pointed out, however, that in
these words we have not one parable but three, . . . drawn
from the circumstances attending three different hours of the
pastoral day. The first parable is that of the shepherd, and
comprises the first six verses. The scene is laid in the early
morning. During the night the sheep have been• sheltered in
a large open enclosure, in which, under the care of a single
porter, numbers of flocks belonging to different owners have
shared a common protection.
    "The second parable, which is that of the door, runs from
the seventh to the tenth verse, and carries forward our
 26          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

  thought from daybreak to midday, and from the large night-
  fold to a structure set in the middle of the pasture. This fold
  is meant to afford shade and security amid the day's heat and
  danger. The sheep may go in and out at will, according as
  they want food and rest. It was of this structure, with its
  wide swinging door, that Christ was thinking when He called
  Himself the Door. That door was at once a protection and a
  means of freedom.
      "The third parable shifts the scene still farther forward
r and brings us to the close of the day. The shadows are creep-
  ing up the mountain slopes. The chills of , sundown are in the
  air. The flocks must be led back to the night-fold. But on
  the way a sudden danger emerges. Wolves spring out of am-
  bush and attack the sheep. It is a critical moment, and tests
  the quality of the shepherd. The hireling runs away. The
. good shepherd casts himself between the sheep and the wolves,
  and sacrifices himself to save the flock."—Tarbell.
      2. The shepherd "depends upon the sheep to follow, and
  they in turn expect him never to leave them. They run after
  him if he appears to be escaping from them, and are terrified
  when he is out of sight, or any stranger appears instead of
  him. He calls them from time to time to let them know that
  he is at hand. The sheep listen and continue grazing, but if
  anyone else tries to produce the same peculiar cries and gut-
  tural sounds, they look around with a startled air and begin to
  scatter."—Mackie. .
      3. Christ said He was the "door of the sheep" because He
  was thinking of His individual followers, the sheep, rather
  than of the fold, His church. In this parable, He also speaks
  of Himself as the door of the fold; but He would have us feel
  that individually we are thought of and cared for.
      4. Beneath the burning skies and the clear, starry nights
  of Palestine there grows up between the shepherd and his
  flock a union of attachment and tenderness. In that country,
  at an unexpected moment. sheep are liable to be swept away
  by some mountain torrent, or carried off by hill robbers, or
  torn by wolves. At any moment, their protector may have to
  save their lives by personal hazard.
      5. John 10: 14, 15: "I am the good shepherd; and I know
  Mine own, and Mine own know Me, even as the Father
  knoweth Me, and I know the Father; and I lay down My life
  for the sheep."—American Revised Version.
      6. "One of the most powerful angels is sent from heaven.
  His countenance is like lightning, and his garments white as
  snow. He parts the darkness from his track. . . . The earth
  trembles and heaves as that powerful being from another
  world approaches. . . . The angel laid hold of the great
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                27
stone at the mouth of the tomb, and rolled it away, as if it
had been but a pebble. Then with a voice that caused the
earth to tremble, he cried: 'Jesus, Thou Son of God, come
forth, Thy Father calls Thee!' "-Mrs. E. G. White, in
"Christ Our Saviour," pp. 151-153.

                             Notes
    1. "Looking upon His disciples with divine love and with
the tenderest sympathy,. Christ said, 'Now is the Son of man
glorified, and God is glorified in Him.' Judas had left the
upper chamber, and Christ was alone with the eleven. He
was about to speak of His approaching separation from them;
but before doing this He pointed to the great object of His
mission. It was this that He kept ever before Him. It was
His joy that all His humiliation and suffering would glorify
the Father's name. To, this He first directs the thoughts of
His disciples."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 662.
    2. This commandment here called "new" was really an old
commandment which we had from the beginning. It was new
in the sense in which we sometimes speak of receiving some
new light, or truth, from the Bible—truth which has been
there ever since the Word was written, but is new to us, we
having never seen it before. This commandment was new to
the disciples in that they had never learned to do it.
    3. A picture of the self-confidence ,of Peter and its result
is presented in the dialogue between him and Jesus. "Satan
has a quiver full of poisoned arrows. Knowest thou which of
them is the most deadly?—It is trust and confidence towards
thyself. See to it that he does not wound thee thereby; for in
the wound will grow the proud flesh of security; and that
afterwards festers into what?—Presumption."—Selected.
"When Peter said he would follow
his Lord to prison and to death, he
meant it, every word of it; but he
did not know himself. Hidden in
his heart were elements of evil that
circumstances would fan into life."

30          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

    4. "When Peter said he would follow his Lord to prison
and to death, he meant it, every word of it; but he did not
know himself. Hidden in his heart were elements of evil that
circumstances would fan into life. Unless he was made
conscious of his danger, these would prove his eternal
ruin. The Saviour saw in him a self-love and assurance that
would overbear even his love for Christ. Much of infirmity,
of unmortified sin, carelessness of spirit, unsanctified temper,
heedlessness in entering into temptation, had been revealed
in his experience. Christ's solemn warning was a call to
heart-searching. Peter needed to distrust himself, and to
have a deeper faith in Christ. Had he in humility received
the warning, he would have appealed to the Shepherd of the
flock to keep His sheep. When on the Sea of Galilee he was
about to sink, he cried, 'Lord, save me.' Then the hand of
Christ was outstretched to, grasp his hand. So now if he had
cried to Jesus, Save me from myself, he would have been kept.
But Peter deft that he was distrusted, and he thought it cruel.
He was already offended, and he became more persistent in•
his self-confidence."—"The Desire of Ages," pp. 673, 674.     '
    5. "By this Christ did not mean that the disciples' work
would be of a more exalted character than His, but that it
would have greater extent. He did' not refer merely to
miracle-working, but to all that would take place under the
working of the Holy Spirit."—Id., p. 664.

                              Notes
    1. "Jesus and the disciples were on the way to Geth-
semane, at the foot of Mount Olivet, a retired spot which He
had often visited for meditation and prayer. The Saviour
had been explaining to His disciples His mission to the world,
and the spiritual relation to Him which they were to sustain.
Now He illustrates the lesson. The moon is shining bright,
and reveals to Him a flourishing grapevine. Drawing the
attention of the disciples to it, He employs it as a symbol.
    " 'I am the true Vine,' He says. Instead of choosing the
giaceful palm, the lofty cedar, or the strong oak, Jesus takes
32          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

the vine with its clinging tendrils to represent Himself. The
palm tree, the cedar, and the oak stand alone. They require
no support. But the vine entwines about the trellis, and thus
climbs heavenward. So Christ in His humanity was depend-
ent upon divine power. 'I can of Mine own self do nothing,'
He declared."—"The Desire of Ages," pp. 674, 675.
     2. "It is because God is leading them that these things
come upon them. Trials and obstacles are the Lord's chosen
methods of discipline and His appointed conditions of success.
He who reads the hearts of men knows their characters
better than they themselves know them. He sees that some
have powers and susceptibilities which, rightly directed, might
be used in the advancement of His work. In His providence
He brings these persons into different positions and varied
circumstances that they may discover in their character the
defects which have been concealed from their own knowledge.
He gives them opportunity to correct these_ aofects, and to
fit themselves for His service. Often He permits the fires of
affliction to assail them that they may be purified."—"Ministry
of Healing," p. 471.
     3. "Abiding in ChrfS't is abiding in the love of • Christ.
Abiding in the love of Christ is abiding in the obedience of
Christ. Duty, in other words, is the equivalent of disciple-
ship. Duty conceived as the will of God and the command of
Christ and faithfully fulfilled, evidences the inner union of
the soul with Christ, as of the branch with the vine. 'And the
great duty which He pressed on His disciples was itself the
duty of unselfish brotherly love."—Speer.
     4. "Abiding in Christ is not a question of a little more or
little better fruit; for 'without Me,' or 'apart from Me,' ye can
do, not little, but 'nothing.' The question is of much fruit, or
of none at all."—J. Hudson Taylor.
     "Ye can no more produce a virtue without the Vine than
can a barbed wire fence grow luscious grapes. All the vigor,
verdure, luxuriance, graces, goodness that we possess have
come to us because the life of Christ has been flowing through
His followers."—Peloubet.
     5. "That first relation—the abiding of the soul in Christ—
if it were perfect, would be enough. An entire sympathy be-
tween you and the Lord would make it impossible for you to
do anything but just what was the Lord's will. But that first
relation is very imperfect and unreliable here. Therefore
God must give Him not merely His own Spirit but His own
words. The soul's abiding in Jesus will make 'him ready to
accept Jesus' words, and then the words will come to lead the
soul into a deeper and still deeper abiding-place in its Say-
iour."—Phillips Brooks.

thereof. Cumbered with humanity, Christ could not be in
every place personally. Therefore it was for their interest
that He should go to the Father, and send the Spirit to be
His successor on earth. No one could then have any advan-
tage because of his location or his personal contact with
Christ. By the Spirit the Saviour would be accessible to all.
In this sense He would be nearer to them than if He had not
ascended on high."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 669.
    2. The word "world" is here used in the same sense as the
word "flesh," or "carnal heart," used in other passages of
Scripture. The worldly, or carnal heart is opposed to
spiritual things, and cannot understand them, because they
are spiritually discerned.
    3. "In describing to His disciples the office work of the
Holy Spirit, Jesus sought to inspire them with the joy and
hope that inspired His own heart. He rejoiced because of the
abundant help He had provided for His church. The Holy
Spirit was the highest of all gifts that He could solicit from
His Father for the exaltation of His people. The Spirit was
to .be given as a regenerating agent, and without this the

sacrifice of Christ would have been of no avail. The power of
evil had been strengthening for centuries, and the submission
of men to this satanic captivity was amazing. Sin could be
resisted and overcome only through the mighty agency of the
third person of the Godhead, who would come with no modified
energy, but in the fullness of divine power. It is the Spirit
that makes effectual what has been wrought out by the world's
Redeemer. It is by the Spirit that the heart is made pure.
Through the Spirit the believer becomes a partaker of the
divine nature. Christ has given His Spirit as a divine power
to overcome all hereditary and cultivated tendencies to evil,
and to impress His own character upon His church."—Id.,
 p. 671.
     4. "There are none so hardened as those who have slighted
the invitation of mercy, and done despite to the Spirit of
grace. The most common manifestation of the sin against the
Holy Spirit, is in persistently slighting Heaven's invitation
to repent. Every step in the rejection of Christ is a step to-
ward the rejection of salvation, and toward the sin against
the Holy Spirit.
     "In rejecting Christ the Jewish people committed the un-
pardonable sin; and by refusing the invitation of mercy, we
may commit the same error. We offer insult to the Prince of
life, and put Him to shame before the synagogue of Satan,
 and before the heavenly universe, when we refuse to listen
 to His delegated messengers, and instead listen to the agents
 of Satan, who would draw the soul away from Christ. So
 long as one does this, he can find no hope or pardon, and he
 will finally lose all desire to be reconciled to God."—Id., p. 324.
     "When a person once neglects to heed the invitations, re-
 proofs, and warnings, of the Spirit of God, his conscience be-
 comes seared, and the next time he is admonished, it will be
 more difficult to yield obedience than before. And thus with
 every repetition. Conscience is the voice of God, heard amid,
 the conflict of human passions; when it is resisted, the Spirit
 of God is grieved. .
     "Man at first resists a motion of the Spirit of God, and,
 having once resisted, it is less difficult to do so the second
  time, less the third, and far less the fourth. Then comes the
 harvest to be reaped from the seed of unbelief and resistance.
  Oh, what a harvest of sinful indulgences is preparing for the
  sickle!"—"Testimonies for the Church," volume 5, p. 120.

        CHRISTIAN SCIENCE X-RAYED
                        By William G. Wirth
THERE was a time when Christian Science was regarded
    as a fad, an abnormal growth on the tree of religion. In-
stead of a fad, it is now recognized as a settled thing; the
abnormal growth has turned out to be a large branch. There-
fore, to dismiss Christian Science lightly, as many do, with
a derogatory remark or jest, will not solve the problem.
    Any interpretation of Christian Science stands or falls as
it is or is not based on the Bible. That is the test. This
new book sets the teachings of this system alongside the Word,
that the reader may distinguish the false from the genuine.
    The Sabbath school lessons this quarter point us to Christ,
as revealed in His word. Yet Christian Science would do
away in large measure with the Bible as the one standard for
Christian living, and substitute the word of another.
    Thousands are thus being led away from the Bible and
its truths, and accepting this most subtle substitute.
    It is the duty of every true follower of the great Teacher
to counteract this evil. One of the very best means to this
end is a wide circulation of the pamphlet "Christian Sci-
ence X-Rayed."
    The following are the chapter titles, which will serve to
indicate the method by which the subject is treated:
   Did Mrs. Eddy Get Her Ideas from God, or from Dr. Quimby?
   Do Mrs. Eddy and the Bible Agree?
   The Incarnation, Atonement, Death, and Resurrection of Christ Denied.
   Christian Science on Marriage, Heaven, Angels, and a Devil.
   Is Christian Science Scientific?
   Christian Science Versus Medical Science.
   Did Christ Use Mrs. Eddy's Methods of Healing the Sick?
   Does Christian Science Really Heal? If So, How and Why?
   The Magnetism of Christian Science Explained.

    There are 96 pages in the pamphlet, with cover printed
in colors. Price 25c, postpaid. Liberal discount on quantities.
