                      FROM
       Acorn to Oak
       HIS is a new booklet by Mrs. L. Flora Plummer,
   T   giving a history of the Sabbath school work of
   the denomination. The origin of the Sabbath school
  idea is traced back to the days of Abraham. Points
  of similarity between the Bible schools of the Jews
  and the Sabbath schools of to-day are shown. The
  part that Bible schools had in the work of the Ref-
  ormation is well set forth. The story of Robert
  Raikes's establishment of Sunday schools is re-
  lated, and the personal touch is given by connecting
  with it the experience of one of our own members
  who taught in the Raikes system of schools.
     Coming down to modern times, the story of how
  the Sabbath school acorn, planted in 1852, has be-
  come the giant oak of to-day, is told. The descrip-
  tion of the early schools of the denomination is
  especially interesting. Step by step, the progress
  of the work is traced through its various stages of
  organization. Vital statistics are given in attrac-
  tive form. The illustration showing Elder James
  White writing the first series of Sabbath school
  lessons, using his lunch basket for a desk, is an ap-
  propriate frontispiece. The reading of this booklet
  should deepen appreciation of what the Sabbath
  school stands for, and inspire all to greater en-
  deavors in its behalf.

                              Notes
    1. "The sin of Jacob, and the train of events to which it
led, had not failed to exert an influence for evil,— an influence
that revealed its bitter fruit in the character and life of his
sons. As these sons arrived at manhood, they developed
serious faults. The results of polygamy were manifest in the
household. This terrible•evil tends to dry up the very springs
of love, and its influence weakens the most sacred ties. The
jealousy of the several mothers had embittered the family re-
lation, the children had grown up contentious, and impatient
of control, and the father's life was darkened with anxiety
and grief.
    "There was one, however, of a widely different charac-*
ter,— the elder son of Rachel   , Joseph, whose rare personal
beauty seemed but to reflect an inward beauty of mind and
heart. Pure, active, and joyous, the lad gave evidence also
of moral earnestness and firmness."—"Patriarchs and
 Prophets," pp. 208, 209.
    In Gen. 49: 26, Joseph is spoken of as one "that was
separate from his brethren."
    2. Joseph's coat of many colors was not an inharmonious
combination of colors curiously wrought together, as some
have supposed. The Oriental people are very fond of highly
contrasting colors. The more colors wrought into it, the more
 costly and uncommon the garment. The Oriental style of
 coat is usually long and flowing, and when made up of highly
colored silks and velvets and embroidered with gold thread,
presents an elegant appearance. This was doubtless the kind
of garment Jacob made for Joseph, and it signified his great
 esteem for the lad. But Joseph's possession of this costly
 coat was the cause of much jealousy among his brothers.
    "Jacob unwisely manifested his preference for Joseph, and
this excited the jealousy of his other sons. As Joseph wit-
 nessed the evil conduct of his brothers, he was greatly
 troubled; he ventured gently to remonstrate with them, but
 only aroused still further their hatred and resentment. He
 could not endure to see them sinning against God, and he
 laid the matter before his father, hoping that his authority
 might lead them to reform.
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   5

    "Jacob carefully avoided exciting their anger by harsh-
ness or severity. With deep emotion he expressed his solici-
tude for his children, and implored them to have respect for
his gray hairs, and not to bring reproach upon his name; and
above all not to dishonor God by such disregard of His pre-
cepts. Ashamed that their wickedness was known, the young
men seemed to be repentant, but they only concealed their real
feelings, which were rendered more bitter by this exposure.
    "The father's injudicious gift to Joseph of a costly coat, or
tunic, such as was usually worn by persons of distinction,
seemed to them another evidence of his partiality, and excited
a suspicion that he intended to pass by his elder children, to
bestow the birthright upon the son of Rachel."— Id., p. 209.
    3. "They [Joseph's brothers] would have executed their
purpose but for Reuben. He shrunk from participating in the
murder of his brother, and proposed that Joseph be cast alive
into a pit, and left there to perish; secretly intending, how-
ever, to rescue him, and return him to his father. Having
persuaded all to consent to this plan, Reuben left the com-
pany, fearing that he might fail to control his feelings, and
that his real intentions would be discovered."— Id., p. 211.
    4. "The patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into
Egypt." Acts 7: 9. Envy signifies malice, ill will, spite,
chagrin, mortification, discontent, or uneasiness at the sight of
another's excellence or good fortune; a repining at the pros-
perity or good of another. The wise man asks, "Who is able
to stand before envy?" Prov. 27: 4. The beginning of the
history of the children of Israel was marked with envious
 hatred against their younger brother, Joseph. Near the end
of their history as a nation, they manifested the most in-
tensely bitter hatred, even unto death, against ;their Elder
 Brother, Jesus. Joseph was the tender and most beloved son
of his father, through whom he desired communication with
 his children; but his brothers sold him for twenty pieces of
 silver. Jesus was the only Son of God, through whom God
 emptied His infinite heart .of love upon His fallen sons of
 earth; but they sold Him for thirty pieces of silver.
     5. Jacob did not go into his grave mourning for Joseph,
 as he thought he would. God was only sending Joseph be-
 forehand into Egypt to preserve Jacob and his family in the
 time of famine. That which at times seems to be against us
 may be working for our salvation.

                              Notes
     1. "Joseph with his captors was on the way to Egypt.
 As the caravan journeyed southward toward the borders of
 Canaan, the boy could discern in the distance the hills among
 which lay his father's tents. Bitterly he wept at thought of
 that loving father in his loneliness and affliction. . . . What a
 change in situation — from the tenderly cherished son to the
 despised and helpless slave! Alone and friendless, what
 would be his lot in the strange land to which he was going?
 For a time, Joseph gave himself up to uncontrolled grief
 and terror. . . .
     "Then his thoughts turned to his father's God. In his
 childhood he had been taught to love and fear Him. Often
 in his father's tent he had listened to the story of the vision
 that Jacob saw as he fled from his home an exile and a fugi-
 tive. He had been told of the Lord's promises to Jacob, and
  how they had been fulfilled,— how, in the hour of need, the
 angels of God had come to instruct, comfort, and protect him.
 And he had learned of the love of God in providing for men
  a Redeemer. Now all these precious lessons came vividly be-
  fore him. Joseph believed that the God of his fathers would
8          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

be his God. He then and there gave himself fully to the Lord,
and he prayed that the Keeper of Israel would be with him
in the land of his exile."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," pp.
213, 214.
    2. "Arriving in Egypt, Joseph was sold to Potiphar,
captain of the king's guard, in whose service he remained for
ten years. He was here exposed to temptations of no ordinary
character. He was in the midst of idolatry. The worship of
false gods was surrounded by all the pomp of royalty, sup-
ported by the wealth and culture of the most highly civilized
nation then in existence. Yet Joseph preserved his simplicity,
and his fidelity to God. The sights and sounds of vice were
all about him, but he was one who saw and heard not. His
thoughts were not permitted to linger upon forbidden sub-
jects. The desire to gain the favor of the Egyptians could
not cause him to conceal his principles. Had he attempted
to do this, he would have been overcome by temptation; but
be was not ashamed of the religion of his fathers, and he
made no effort to hide the fact that he was a worshiper of
Jehovah."— Id., p. 214.
    3. "The marked prosperity which attended everything
placed under Joseph's care was not the result of a direct
miracle; but his industry, care, and energy were crowned with
the divine blessing."— Ibid.
    4. "Joseph's faith and integrity were to be tested by fiery
trials. His master's wife endeavored to entice the young man
to transgress the law of God. Heretofore he had remained
untainted by the corruption teeming in that heathen land;
but this temptation, so sudden, so strong, so seductive,—
how should it be met? Joseph knew well what would be the
consequence of resistance. On the one hand were conceal-
ment, favor, and rewards; on the other, disgrace, imprison-
ment, perhaps death. His whole future life depended upon
the decision of the moment. Would principle triumph?
Would Joseph still be true to God? With inexpressible
anxiety, angels looked upon the scene."— Id., p. 217.
    5. "The love and fear of God kept Joseph pure and un-
tarnished in the king's court. He was exalted to great wealth;
to the high honor of being next to the king; and this elevation
was as sudden as it was great. It is impossible to stand upon
a lofty height without danger. The tempest leaves unharmed
the modest flower of the valley, while it wrestles with the
lofty tree upon the mountain top. There are many men whom
 God could have used with wonderful success when pressed
with poverty,— He could have made them useful here, and
crowned them with glory hereafter,— but prosperity ruined
them; they were dragged down to the pit, because they forgot
 to be humble, forgot that God was their strength, and became
 independent and self-sufficient.
             SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  9

   "Joseph bore the test of character in adversity, and the
gold was undimmed by prosperity. He showed the same
sacred regard for God's will when he stood next the throne as
when in a-prisoner's cell. Joseph carried his religion every-
where, and this was the secret of his unwavering fidelity."—
"Testimonies," vol. 4, P. 544.
    6. "There are few who realize the influence of the little
things of life upon the development of character. Nothing
with which we have to do is really small. The varied circum-
stances that we meet day by day are designed to test our
faithfulness, and to qualify us for greater trusts. By ad-
herence to principle in the transactions of ordinary life, the
mind becomes accustomed to hold the claims of duty above
those of pleasure and inclination. . . .
   "An upright character is of greater worth than the gold
of Ophir. Without it none can rise to an honorable eminence.
But character is not inherited. It cannot be bought. Moral
excellence and fine mental qualities are not the result of ac-
cident. The most precious gifts are of no value unless they
are improved. The formation of a noble character is the
work of a lifetime, and must be the result of diligent and per-
severing effort. God gives opportunities; success depends
upon the use made of them."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," pp.
222, 223.

                              Notes
    1. Brugsch Bey discovered inscriptions which tell how "for
seven successive years the Nile did not overflow, and vegeta-
tion withered and failed, that the land was devoid of crops, and
during these years famine and misery devastated the land
of Egypt."
    2. How long a journey had the ten brothers? "One of
from ten to twelve days. They would go from Hebron over
the hills westward to the seacoast plains, and then along the
great caravan road through Philistia southward, and then
the long, hot journey through the desert to the gfeat wall
bordering Egypt, where they would be stopped and examined
before being allowed to continue their course to the capital.
It was the road over which the sadly wronged Joseph had
been led twenty years before. How often during the journey
those ten men must have thought of that!"— P_eloubet.
    3. "We are not to suppose that Joseph personally sold the
grain to all buyers, but that he ordered the selling of it, and
set the price upon it; and very probably when a company of
 foreigners came to purchase in large quantities, they were in-
troduced personally. to Joseph, that he might inquire concern-
 ing them and give direction as to the sale of grain to them."—
 Speaker's Commentary.
    4. "On his [Joseph's] return, he commanded that Simeon
 be bound before them, and again committed to prison. In
 the cruel treatment of their brother, Simeon had been the
 instigator and chief actor, and, it was for this reason that the
 choice fell upon him."—"Patriarehs and Prophets," p. 226.
     5. "Jacob said, 'All these things are against me.' It was
 a great mistake. Joseph was alive — the governor of Egypt
 — sent there to preserve their lives, and to be the stay of
 Jacob's closing years. Simeon was also alive—the blessed
 link which was drawing and compelling his brothers to return
 into the presence of the strange Egyptian governor. Ben-
 jamin would come safely back again. All things, so far from
 being against him, were working together for good to him;
 and if only he would trust in God, he would live to see it so.
 All things are yours, if you are Christ's. All things serve you.
 Even those that seem most awry and trying are really pro-
 moting your best interests. . . . Let us cultivate the 'habit of
 looking at the bright side of things. If there are only a few
12          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

clouds floating in your sky, do not state that the whole is
overcast; and if all the heaven is covered, save one small chink
of blue, make much of that; and by all means do not exagger-
ate the darkness."— Meyer.
    6. Twenty years before, the jealousy of Joseph's brothers
would not permit them to see Joseph better loved than them-
selves. Now, to test them, Joseph .sends Benjamin a portion
of food five times as great as that given the others. They
show no spirit of jealousy at the partiality shown Benjamin.
There were no sullen looks, no spiteful whispers, no envious
glances toward the fortunate younger brother.
    7. "Joseph, in giving corn to save his own brethren and
the Egyptians from starvation, is a type of our Lord, who
gives the bread of life to Jew and gentile — to all that come
to Him in their hopeless need. And in this return of the full
money in the sacks we are reminded that salvation is with-
out money and without price. Whatever we bring to enrich
Christ He returns to us. His gifts are all of His unmerited
grace and favor. Very often we move forward with dread
into the unknown; but that dread is the child of ignorance.
If only we realized that love is waiting for us there, which
does not ask for balm and honey, for spices and myrrh, but
just for ourselves, how much happier life would become! Lift
up your hearts; a feast awaits you !"— Meyer.

                             Notes
   1. "This cup was supposed to possess the power of de-
tecting any poisonous substance placed therein. At that day,
cups of this kind were highly valued as a safeguard against
murder by poisoning. . . .
   "The brothers rent their garments in token of utter
wretchedness, and slowly returned to the city. By their own
promise, Benjamin was doomed to a life of slavery. They fol-
lowed the steward to the palace, and finding the governor
yet there, they prostrated themselves before him. 'What deed
14         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

is this that ye have done?' he said. l'srot ye not that such a
man as I can certainly divine?' Joseph designed to draw
from them an acknowledgment of their sin. He had never
claimed the power of divination, but was willing to have them
believe that he could read the secrets of their lives."—"Patri-
archs and Prophets," p. 229.
    2. Note the following on the speech of Judah:
    "The speech is the finest specimen of dignified and per-
suasive eloquence in the Old Testament."—"International
Critical Commentary."
    "In all literature there is nothing, more pathetic than this
appeal of Judah."— F. B. Meyer.
    "It is a literary gem. It is unstudiedly artful and un-
forcedly rhetorical. It is sustained, pathetic, simple, dra-
matic."— W. W. White, Ph. D.
    "It is a more moving oration than ever orator. pro-
nouiiced."— Lawson.
    3. "Joseph was satisfied. He had seen in his brothers .the
fruits of true repentance. Upon hearing Judah's noble offer,
he gave orders that all but these men should withdraw;
then weeping aloud, he cried, 'I am Joseph; doth my father
yet live?'"—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 230.
    4. "God made Joseph a fountain of life to the Egyptian
nation. Through Joseph the life of that whole people was
preserved. Through Daniel God saved the life of all the wise
men of Babylon. And these deliverances were as object les-
sons; they illustrated to the people the spiritual blessings of-
fered them through connection with the God whom Joseph and
Daniel worshiped. So through His people to-day God desires
to bring blessings to the world. Every worker in whose heart
Christ abides, every one who will show forth His love to the
world, is a worker together with God for the blessing of
humanity."—"Testimonies," vol. 6, p. 227.
    5. "Another act of humiliation remained for the ten
brothers. They now confessed to their father the deceit and
cruelty that for so many years had embittered his life and
theirs. Jacob had not suspected them of so base a sin, but
he saw that all had been overruled for good, and he for-
gave and blessed his erring children. . .
    "Jacob had sinned, and had deeply suffered. Many years
of toil, care, and sorrow had been his since the day when his
great sin caused him to flee from his father's tents. A home-
less fugitive, separated from his mother, whom he never
saw again; laboring seven years for her whom he loved, only
to be basely cheated; toiling twenty years in the service of
a covetous and grasping kinsman; seeing his wealth increas-
ing and sons rising around him, but finding little joy in the
contentious and divided household; distressed by his daugh-
ter's shame, by her brothers' revenge, by the death of Rachel,
by the unnatural crime of Reuben, by Judah's sin, by the cruel
              SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                15
deception and malice practiced toward Joseph,- how- long
and dark is the catalogue of evils spread out to view! Again
and again he had reaped the fruit of that first wrong deed.
Over and over he saw repeated among his sons the sins of
which he himself had been guilty."-"Patriarchs and
Prophets," pp. 232, 237, 238.

       of the promise? Verses 25, 26.
                              Notes
      1. "Evidently Joseph's invitation to his father to come to
 him in Egypt aroused very earnest questionings in Jacob's
 soul. Was it a wise step for him to take? Perhaps he re-
 membered Gen. 15: 13, and dreaded to take the risk. Under
 these circumstances he went to Beersheba, the well of the
 oath, so intimately associated with the lives of Abraham and
 Isaac, and from which he had gone forth On his life's pil-
 grimage. There he offered special sacrifices and received
 special directions and promises. He was not only to go down
 into Egypt, but to go there under the divine guidance and
 protection. When we visit Egypt at our own impulse we shall
 land ourselves, as Abraham and Isaac did, in temptation and
 failure; but when God bids us go, we may make the journey
 with absolute impunity. Though we walk through the dark
 valley, we need not fear, if He be with us."— Meyer.
      2. "The promise had been given to Abraham of a posterity
 numberless as the stars; but as yet the chosen people had in-
 creased but slowly. And the land of Canaan now offered no
 field for the development of such a nation as had been fore-
 told. It was in the poSsession of powerful heathen tribes.
 . . . Egypt, however, offered the conditions necessary to the
 fulfillment of the divine purpose. A section of country, well
 watered and fertile, was open to them there, affording every
 advantage for their speedy increase."—"Patriarchs and
 Prophets," p. 232.
      3. Joseph showed still further his nobleness of character
 in the way he treated his father. He went out to meet him
 with a chariot and servants. He embraced him, and kissed
 him, and honored him. Then he introduced him to the king,
 not as one of whom he was ashamed and for whom he felt he
 must apologize, but as one in whom he took an honorable
             SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                17
pride. And Jacob, we must remember, was not used to the
ways of the court. "To the courtiers of Pharaoh's palace
he would seem simple, rustic, rude, and half civilized. He
could not have presented himself in court attire. He cer-
tainly would not have been able to speak in court dialect, and
would have been wholly unused to court etiquette.
    "Quite likely it was expected that Jacob would prostrate
himself before the king, as was the custom. But Jacob's
life, close to the King of heaven, placed him above a heathen
king, though the greatest monarch on earth, and 'in conscious
superiority, he raised his hands and blessed Pharaoh.'
    "There was great respect for old •age in Egypt; and
Pharaoh, who might have resented the assumption of su-
periority, had it been made by a younger man, yielded grace-
fully to one so far advanced in years, and bent, it may be,
to receive the benediction."—Rawlinson.
    4. "The fear of Joseph's brethren illustrates the insecurity
of a position which is conceded only at the bidding of the ten-
der caprice of love, apart from satisfaction based on satis-
fied justice.. As Joseph had pardoned, so he might retract
his pardon. No satisfaction, beyond tears, had been rendered
for that far-away sin. Might he not even now require it!'
So fears might legitimately arise in our hearts, had not the
divine forgiveness been based on the finished work of the
cross !"—Meyer.
    5. Joseph had lived at home in Hebron seventeen years.
For ten years he was a slave in Egypt, three years in an
Egyptian prison, and eighty years ruler in Egypt.

                              Notes
    1. "Satan was the mover in this matter. He knew that
a deliverer was to be raised up among the Israelites; and by
leading the king to destroy their children he hoped to defeat
the divine purpose. But the women feared God, and dared
not execute the cruel mandate. The Lord approved their
course, and prospered them. The king, angry at the failure
of his design, made the command more urgent and extensive.
The whole nation was called upon to hunt out and slaughter
his helpless victims."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p..242.
     The more they afflicted them, the more they grew! "Times
of affliction have often been the church's growing times.
Christianity spread most when it was persecuted; the blood of
the martyrs was the seed of the church."— M. Henry.
     "The proposed effect of this oppression .was (1) to de-
stroy their physical strength; (2) to break their spirit and
courage; (3) to check their increase by destroying thrift,
thus leading to disease; and (4) perhaps to make them so
wretched that they would destroy their children to save them
from so hard a life."— Peloubet.
     2. "The babe was 'a goodly child;' and the parents, be-
lieving that the time of Israel's release was drawing near,
and that God would raise up a deliverer for His people, de-
termined that their little one should not be sacrificed. Faith
in God strengthened their hearts, 'and they were not afraid
of the king's commandment.'"—"Patriarchs and Prophets,"
 pp. 242, 243.
     3. "Jochebed was a woman and a slave. Her lot in life
was humble, her burden heavy. But through no other woman,
save Mary of Nazareth, has the world received greater bless-
ing. Knowing that her child must soon pass beyond her care,
 to the guardianship of those who knew not God, she the more
 earnestly endeavored to link his soul with heaven. She sought
 to implant in his heart love and loyalty to God. And faith-
 fully was the work accomplished. Those principles of truth
 that were the burden of his mother's teaching and the les-
 son of her life, no after-influence could induce Moses to re-
 nounce."—"Education," p. 61.
     4. We do not know what was the occasion of this great
 decision. But in some way, Moses had come to the place where
 he must go wholly with the Egyptians in religion and life, or
 he must choose God, the truth, and the afflicted people of God.
20          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

Like most great decisions, his case turned on an act which de-
termined his whole future course. The fact that this deci-
sion was made through faith shows that it was not a sudden
passionate impulse, but a deliberate choice of God and
righteousness.
    5. Here is taught an important lesson concerning reverence.
In the East, when a person enters a place of worship, a home,
or sometimes when he stands in the presence of one of su-
perior rank, the shoes, which ordinarily consist of soles tied
to the feet by straps running over the instep, are removed out
of reverence or respect. With those of the West, the equiva-
lent is signified by the removal of the hat, with this difference:
the removal of the shoes is with an Oriental a confession of
unworthiness to stand in the presence of one of superior
holiness or power.
    "Humility and reverence should characterize the deport-
ment of all who come into the presence of God. In the name
of Jesus we may come before Him with confidence, but we
must not approach Him with the boldness of presumption, as
though He were on a level with ourselves. There• are those
who address the great and all-powerful and holy God, who
dwelleth in light unapproachable, as they would address an
equal, or even an inferior. There are those who conduct
themselves in His house as they would not presume to do in
the audience-chamber of an earthly ruler."—"Patriarchs and
Prophets," p. 252.
    6. "After this experience, Moses heard the call from
heaven to exchange his shepherd's crook for the rod of au-
thority; to leave his flock of sheep and take the leadership of
Israel. The divine command found him self-distrustful, slow
of speech, and timid. He was overwhelmed with a sense of his
incapacity to be a mouthpiece for God. But he accepted the
work, putting his whole trust in the Lord. The greatness of
his mission called into exercise the best powers of his mind.
God blessed his ready obedience, and he became eloquent,
hopeful, self-possessed, fitted for the greatest work ever given
to man."—"Ministry of Healing," p. .475.
    7. "A man will gain power and efficiency as he accepts
the responsibilities that God places upon him, and with his
whole soul seeks to qualify himself to bear them aright. How-
ever humble his position or limited his ability, that man will
attain true greatness who, trusting to divine strength, seeks
to perform his work with fidelity. Had Moses relied upon his
own strength and wisdom and eagerly accepted the great
charge, he would have evinced his entire unfitness for such a
work. The fact that a man feels his weakness, is at least
some evidence that he realizes the magnitude of the work ap-
pointed him, and that he will make God his counselor and his
strength."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 255.

                             Notes
    1. "In the command for Israel's release, the Lord said to
Pharaoh, 'Israel is My son, even My first-born. . . . Let My
son go, that he may serve Me.' Ex. 4: 22, 23. The psalmist
tells us why God delivered Israel from Egypt: 'He brought
forth His people with joy, and His chosen with gladness; and
gave them the lands of the heathen; and they inherited the
labor of the people; that they might observe His statutes,
and keep His laws.' Ps. 105: 43-45. Here we learn that the
Hebrews could not serve God in Egypt. . . .
    "The Sabbath was one of the things in which they could
not serve the Lord in Egypt; and when Moses and Aaron
came with the message of God (Ex. 4: 29-31), they attempted
a reform, which only increased the oppression. The Israelites
were delivered that they might. observe the statutes of the
Lord, including the fourth commandment, and this placed
upon them an additional obligation, to keep the Sabbath
strictly, as well as to keep all the commandments."—"Patri-
archs and Prophets," Appendix, note 4.
    2. The Egyptians made Israel serve with "rigor." Ex.
1: 13. "The word translated 'rigor' is a very rare one. It is
derived from a root which means to break in pieces, to crush."
—Rawlinson.
    "From the original word here used comes the Latin ferot,
and the English fierce."— Bush.
    "Such rigor is seen pictured on the ancient monuments of
Egypt; heavy burdens, savage whips wielded by taskmasters,
poor food, naked backs, intolerable suffering."— Pelou bet.
    3. "The Hebrews had expected to obtain their freedom
without any special trial of their faith, or any real suffering
or hardship. But they were not yet prepared for deliverance.
They had little faith in God, and were unwilling patiently to
endure their afflictions until He should see fit to work for
them. Many were content to remain in bondage, rather than
                SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON 'QUARTERLY             23

  meet the difficulties attending removal to a strange land; and
  the habits of some had become so much like those of the
  Egyptians that they preferred to dwell in Egypt. There-
  fore the Lord did not deliver them by the first manifestation
  of His power before Pharaoh. He overruled events more
  fully to develop the tyrannical spirit of the Egyptian king,
  and also to reveal Himself to His people. Beholding His
. justice, His power, and His love, they would choose to leave
  Egypt and give themselves to His service. The task of Moses
  would have been much less difficult, had not many of the
  Israelites become so corrupted that they were unwilling to
  leave Egypt."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 260.
      4. "The magicians did not really cause their rods to be-
  come serpents; but by magic, aided by the great deceiver,
  they were able to produce this appearance. It was beyond
  the power of Satan to change the rods to living serpents. The
  prince of evil, though possessing all the wisdom and might
  of an angel fallen, has not power to create, or to give life;
  this is the prerogative of God alone. But all that was in
  Satan's power to do, he did; he produced a counterfeit. To
  human sight the rods were changed to serpents. Such they
  were believed to be by Pharaoh and his court. There was
  nothing in their appearance to distinguish them from the
  serpent produced by Moses. Though the Lord caused the
  real serpent to swallow up the spurious ones, yet even this
  was regarded by Pharaoh, not as a work of God's power, but
  as the result of a kind of magic superior to that of his
  servants."— Id., p. 264.
      5. "God had declared concerning Pharaoh, 'I will harden
  his heart, that he shall not let the people go.' There was no
  exercise of supernatural power to harden the heart of the
  king. God gave to Pharaoh the most striking evidence of di-
  vine power; but the monarch stubbornly refused to heed the
  light. Every display of infinite power, rejected by him, ren-
  dered him the more determined in his rebellion. The seeds
  of rebellion that he sowed when he rejected the first miracle,
  produced their harvest. As he continued to venture on in his
  own course, going from one degree of stubbornness to an-
  other, his heart became more and more hardened, until he was
  called to look upon the cold, dead faces of the first-born."—
 Id., p. 268.

                              Notes
    1. "In Gen. 15: 13 we read that the Lord said to Abraham,
'Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land
that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict
them four hundred years.' Ex. 12: 40 says, 'The sojourning
of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hun-
dred and thirty years.' But Paul in Gal. 3: 15-17 says that
from the making of the covenant with Abraham to the giving
of the law at Sinai was four hundred and thirty years.
    "From these scriptures, then, we are not to understand
that the Israelites were in Egypt four hundred years. The
actual- time spent in Egypt could have been only about two
hundred and fifteen years. The Bible says that 'the sojourn-
ing of the children of Israel' was four hundred and thirty
 years. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the ancestors of the
 Israelites, were sojourners in Canaan. The period of four
 hundred and thirty years dates from the promise given to
 Abraham when he was commanded to leave Ur of the Chal-
 dees. The four hundred years of Gen. 15: 13 dates from a
 later period. Notice that the period of four hundred years
is not only a time of .sojourning, but of affliction. This, ac-
 cording to the Scriptures, must be reckoned from thirty years
 later, about the time when Ishmael, 'he that was born after
 the flesh, persecuted him [Isaac] that was born after the
 Spirit.' Gal. 4: 29."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," Appendix,
 note 6.
     2. "This song and the great deliverance which it commemo-
 rates, made an impression never to be effaced from the memory
 of the Hebrew people. From age to age it was echoed by the
 prophets and singers of Israel, testifying that Jehovah is the
 strength and deliverance of those who trust in Him. That
 song does not belong to the Jewish people alone. It points
26          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

 forward to the destruction of all the foes of righteousness,
 and the final victory of the Israel of God. The prophet of
 Patmos beholds the white-robed multitude that 'have gotten
 the victory,' standing on the 'sea of glass mingled with fire,'
 having 'the harps of God. And they sing the song of Moses
 the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb.'
     " 'Not unto us, 0 Lord, not unto us, but unto Thy name
 give glory, for Thy mercy, and for Thy truth's sake.' Such
 was the spirit that pervaded Israel's song of deliverance, and
 it is the spirit that should dwell in the hearts of all who love
 and fear God. In freeing our souls from the bondage of sin,
 God has wrought for us a deliverance greater than that of
 the Hebrews at the Red Sea. Like the Hebrew host, we should
 praise the Lord with heart and soul and voice for His 'won-
 derful works to the children of men.' Those who dwell upon
 God's great mercies, and are not unmindful of His lesser gifts,
will put on the girdle of gladness, and make melody in their
 hearts to the Lord."— Id., p. 289.
     3. "They had not as yet suffered from hunger; their
 present wants were supplied, but they feared for the future.
. . . The Lord permitted difficulties to surround them, and
their supply of food to be cut short, that their hearts might
turn to Him who had hitherto been their deliverer."— Id.,
p. 292.
     4. "The history of the wilderness life of Israel was
chronicled for the benefit of the Israel of God to the close of
time. The record of God's dealings with the wanderers of the
desert in all their marchings to and fro, in their exposure to
hunger, thirst, and weariness, and in the striking manifesta-
tions of His power for their relief, is fraught with warning
and instruction for His people in all ages. The varied ex-
perience of the Hebrews was a school of preparation for their
promised home in Canaan. God would have His people in
these days review with a humble heart and teachable spirit
the trials through which ancient Israel passed, that they may
be instructed in their preparation for the heavenly Canaan."
— Id., p. 298.
     5. "For forty years they were daily reminded by this
miraculous provision, of God's unfailing care and tender love.
In the words of the psalmist, God gave them 'of the corn of
heaven. Man did eat angels' food,'— that is, food provided for
them by the angels. Sustained by 'the corn of heaven,' they
were daily taught that, having God's promise, they were as
secure from want as if surrounded by fields of waving grain
on the fertile plains of Canaan.
     "The manna, falling from heaven for the sustenance of
Israel, was a type of Him who came from God to give life to
the world. Said Jesus, 'I am that bread of life. Your fathers
did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead. This is the
             SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  27

bread which cometh down from heaven. . . . If any man eat
of this bread, he shall live forever ; and the bread that I. will
give is My flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.' "

                            Notes
   1. "On the morning of the third day, as the eyes of all
the people were turned toward the mount, its summit was
covered with a thick cloud, which grew more black and dense,
sweeping downward until the entire mountain was wrapped
in darkness and awful mystery. Then a sound as of a trum-
pet was heard, summoning the people to meet with God; and
Moses led them forth to the base of the mountain. From the
thick darkness flashed vivid lightnings, while peals of thun-
der echoed and reechoed among the surrounding heights. . . .
And 'the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder
and louder.' So terrible were the tokens of Jehovah's presence
that the hosts of Israel shook with fear, and fell upon their
faces before the Lord. Even Moses exclaimed, 'I exceedingly
fear and quake.' "-"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 304.
    2. "And now the thunders ceased; the trumpet was no
longer heard; the earth was still. There was a period of
solemn silence, and then the voice of God was heard. Speak-
ing out of the thick darkness that enshrouded Him, as He
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    29
stood upon the mount, surrounded by a retinue of angels, the
Lord made known His law. . . . The law was not spoken at
this time exclusively for the benefit of the Hebrews. God
honored them by making them the guardians and keepers of
His law, but it was to be held as a sacred trust for the whole
world. The precepts of the Decalogue are adapted to all man-
kind, and they were given for the instruction and government
of all. Ten precepts, brief, comprehensive, and authoritative,
cover the duty of ,man to God and to his fellow man; and all
based upon the great fundamental principle of love."— Id., pp.
304, 305.
    3. "Aaron had thought that Moses had been too unyield-
ing to the wishes of the people. He thought that if Moses had
been less firm, less decided at times, and that if he had made
a compromise with the people, and gratified their wishes, he
would have had less tfouble, and there would have been more
peace and harmony in the camp of Israel. He, therefore, had
been trying this new policy. He carried out his natural tem-
perament by yielding to'the wishes of the people, to save dis-
satisfaction and preserve their good will, and thereby prevent
a rebellion, which he thought would certainly come if he did
not yield to their wishes. . . .
    "When, Aaron took the first step in the wrong direction,
the spirit which had actuated the people imbued him, and he
took the lead, and directed as a general, and the people were
singularly obedient. Here Aaron gave decided sanction to
the most aggravated sins, because it was less difficult than
to stand in vindication of the right."—"Testimonies," vol. 3,
 pp. 298, 299.
     4. Nowhere in the Bible is the tremendous power of ear-
nest prayer more clearly revealed than in the words of Je-
hovah to Moses —"Let Me alone."
     5. "If Aaron had had courage to stand for the right,
 irrespective of consequences, he could have prevented that
apostasy. . . .
     "To justify himself, Aaron endeavored to make the people
 responsible for his weakness in yielding to their demand; but
 notwithstanding this, they were filled with admiration of his
 gentleness and patience. But God seeth not as man sees.
 Aaron's yielding spirit and his desire to please, had blinded
 his eyes to the enormity of the crime he was sanctioning.
 His course in giving his influence to sin in Israel, cost the life
 of thousands."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 323.
     6. "It was necessary that this sin should be punished,
 as a testimony to surrounding nations of God's displeasure
 against idolatry. By executing justice upon the guilty, Moses,
 as God's instrument, must leave on record a solemn and public
 protest against their crime. As the Israelites should here-
 after condemn the idolatry of the neighboring tribes, their
30          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

enemies would throw back upon them the charge that the
people who claimed Jehovah as their God had made a calf and
worshiped it in Horeb. Then though compelled to acknowl-
edge the disgraceful truth, Israel could point to the terrible
fate of the transgressors, as evidence that their sin had not
been sanctioned or excused."— Id., p. 325.
    7. "In the prayer of Moses, our minds are directed to the
heavenly records in which the names of all men are inscribed,
and their deeds, whether good or evil, are faithfully regis-
tered. The book of life contains the names of all who have
ever entered the service of God. If any of these depart from
Him, and by stubborn persistence in sin become finally hard-
ened against the influences of His Holy Spirit, their names
will in the Judgment be blotted from the book of life, and they
themselves will be devoted to destruction. Moses realized how
dreadful would be the fate of the sinner; yet if the people
of Israel were to be rejected by the Lord, he desired his name
to be blotted out with theirs; he could not endure to see the
judgments of God fall upon those who had been so graciously
delivered. The intercession of Moses in behalf of Israel il-
lustrates the mediation of Christ for sinful men."—Id.,
p. 326.
    8. "Moses revealed great weakness before the people.
He showed a marked lack of self-control, a spirit similar to
that possessed by the murmurers. He should have been an
example of forbearance and patience before that multitude,
who were ready to excuse their failures, disaffections, and
unreasonable murmurings, on account of this exhibition of
wrong on his part. The greatest sin consisted in assuming
to take the place of God. The position of honor that Moses
had heretofore occupied did not lessen his guilt, but greatly
magnified it."—"Testimonies," vol. 4, p. 370.
    9. "Moses had sinned, and his past fidelity could not atone
for the present sin. . . . Moses artd Aaron must die without
entering Canaan, subjected to the same punishment that fell
upon those in a more lowly position. They bowed in sub-
mission, though with anguish of heart that was inexpressible;
but their love for and confidence in God was unshaken. Their
example is a lesson that many pass over without learning
from it as they should. Sin does not appear sinful. Self-
exaltation does not appear to them grievous."— Ibid.
    10. "The cases of Moses and Aaron, of David, and nu-
merous others, show that it is not a safe thing to sin in
word, or thought, or deed. . . . The touching plea made by
Moses that he might be privileged to enter Canaan was
steadfastly refused. The transgression at Kadesh had been
open and marked; and the more exalted the position of the
offender, the more distinguished the man, the firmer was the
decree, and the more certain the punishment."— Id., pp.
370, 371.

                               Notes
    1. "Nadab and Abihu had not in their youth been trained
to habits of self-control. The father's yielding disposition,
his lack of firmness for right, had led him to neglect the dis-
cipline of his children. His sons.had been permitted to follow
inclination. Habits of self-indulgence, long cherished, ob-
tained a hold upon them which even the responsibility of
the most sacred office had not power to break. They had not
been taught to respect the authority of their father, and they
did not realize the necessity of exact obedience to the re-
quirements of God. Aaron's mistaken indulgence of his sons,
prepared them to become the subjects of the divine judg-
ments."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 360.
    2. "God designed to teach the people that they must ap-
proach Him with reverence and awe, and in His own ap-
pointed manner. He cannot accept partial obedience. It was
not enough that in this solemn season of worship nearly
everything was done as He had directed. God has pro-
nounced a curse upon those who depart from His com-
mandments, and put,,no difference between common and holy
things."— Ibid.
    3. "Nadab and Abihu would never have committed that
fatal sin, had they not first become partially intoxicated by the
free use of wine. . . . Their minds became confused, and
their moral perceptions dulled, so that they could not discern
the difference between the sacred and the common."— Id.,
pp. 361, 362.
    4. "Do not the same evils still exist that lay at the foun-
dation of Korah's ruin? Pride and ambition are widespread;
and when these are cherished, they open the door to envy, and
a striving for supremacy; the soul is alienated from God, and
unconsciously drawn into the ranks of Satan. Like Korah
and his companions, many, even of the professed followers of
Christ, are thinking, planning, and working so eagerly for
self-exaltation, that in order to gain the sympathy and sup-
port of the people, they are ready to pervert the truth,
falsifying and misrepresenting the Lord's servants, and even
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  33
charging them with the base and selfish motives that inspire
their own hearts. By persistently reiterating falsehood, and
that against all evidence, they at last come to believe it to be
truth. While endeavoring to destroy the confidence of the
people in the men of God's appointment, they really believe
that they are engaged in a good work, verily doing God
service."— Id., pp. 403, 404.
    5. "Every advance made by those whom God has called
to lead in His work, has excited suspicion; every act has
been misrepresented by the jealous and faultfinding. Thus it
was in the time of Luther, of the Wesleys and other re-
formers. Thus it is to-day.
   "Korah would not have taken the course he did, had he
known that all the directions and reproofs communicated to
Israel were from God. But he might have known this. God
had given overwhelming evidence that He was leading Israel.
But Korah and his companions rejected light until they
became so blinded that the most striking manifestations of
HIS power were not sufficient to convince them."— Id., pp.
404, 405.

16. For what purpose was he presented in the transfigura-

                              Notes
     1. "It was an ungracious act on the part of the Edomites
- descendants of Esau, Jacob's brother - to forbid the pas-
sage of the chosen people through their territory; and it was
never forgotten. It is referred to again and again in the
strongest terms by prophet and psalmist."- Meyer.
     2. "The hosts of Israel again turned toward the south,
and made their way over sterile wastes, that seemed even
more dreary after a glimpse of the green spots among the
hills and valleys of Edom. From the mountain range over-
looking this gloomy desert, rises Mount Hor."-"Patriarchs
and Prophets," p. 424.
     3. "With deep sorrow, Moses removed from Aaron the
holy vestments, and placed them upon Eleazar, who thus be-
came his successor by divine appointment. For his sin at
Kadesh, Aaron was denied the privilege of officiating as God's
high priest in Canaan,- of offering the first sacrifice in the
goodly land, and thus consecrating the inheritance of Israel.
. . . A wrong act can never be undone. It may be that the
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                 35
work of a lifetime will not recover what has been lost in a
single moment of temptation or even thoughtlessness."—
Id., p. 426.
    4. "Moses turned from the congregation, and in silence
and alone made his way up the mountain side. He went to
the mountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgah.' "— Id., p. 471.
    "And now a panoramic view of the land of promise was
presented to him. . . . In this scene it was presented, not
as it then appeared, but as it would become, with God's
blessing upon it, in the possession of Israel. He seemed to
be looking upon a second Eden."— Id., p. 472.
    "Moses saw the chosen people established in Canaan,
each of the tribes in its own possession. He had a view of
their history after the settlement of the promised land; the
long, sad story of their apostasy and its punishment was
spread out before him. . . . He was permitted to look down
the stream of time, and behold the first advent of our Saviour.
Tie saw Jesus as a babe in Bethlehem. . . . He beheld
Christ's humble life in Nazareth, His ministry of love and
sympathy and healing, his rejection by a proud, unbelieving
nation. . . . He saw Jesus upon Olivet as with weeping
He bade farewell to the city of His love. . . . He followed the
Saviour to Gethsemane, and beheld the agony in the garden,
the betrayal, the mockery and scourging,— the crucifixion."
—Id., p. 475.
    "Moses saw the light of the gospel shining out, through
the disciples of Jesus, to them 'which sat in darkness,'
and thousands from the lands of the gentiles flocking to the
brightness of its rising. And beholding, he rejoiced in the
increase and prosperity of Israel."— Id., p. 476.
    "Still another scene opens to his view,— the earth freed
from the curse, lovelier than the fair land of promise so
lately spread out before him. There is no sin, and death
cannot enter. There the nations of the saved find their
eternal home. With joy unutterable, Moses looks upon the
scene."— Id., p. 477.
    5. "God shut Moses out of Canaan, to teach a lesson which
should never be forgotten,— that He requires exact obedience,
and that men are to beware of taking to themselves the glory
which is due to their Maker. He could not grant the prayer
of Moses that he might share the inheritance of Israel; but
He did not forget or forsake His servant. The God of heaven
understood the suffering that Moses had endured; He had
noted every act of faithful service through those long years of
conflict and trial."— Id., p. 479.
    6. "Upon the mount of transfiguration, Moses was pres-
ent with Elijah, who had been translated. They were sent as
the bearers of light and glory from the Father to His Son.
And thus the prayer of Moses, uttered so many centuries
before, was at last fulfilled. He stood upon 'the goodly
36            SABBATH *SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

mountain,' within the heritage of his people, bearing witness
to Him in whom all the promises to Israel centered. Such
is the last scene revealed to mortal vision in the history of
that man so highly honored of Heaven."— Ibid.
    7. "Christ Himself, with the angels who had buried Moses,
came down from heaven to call forth the sleeping saint. . . .
For the first time, Christ was about to give life to the dead.
As the Prince of life and the shining ones approached the
grave, Satan was alarmed for his supremacy. With his evil
angels he stood to dispute an invasion of the territory that he
claimed as his own. He boasted that the servant of God had
become his prisoner. . . . The Saviour entered into no dis-
pute with His adversary, but He then and there began His
work of breaking the power of the fallen foe, and bringing
the dead to life."— Id., pp. 478, 479.
    8. "Upon the mount the future kingdom of glory was
represented, in miniature,— Christ the king, Moses a repre-
sentative of the risen saints, and Elijah of the translated
ones."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 422.

22. How truly was this promise of the people carried out?
         Verse 31.
                              Notes
     1. The movement that began with the exodus of Israel
 from Egypt was to be a complete movement. It was not de-
 signed to bring a people out of bondage and leave them
 stranded in the wilderness. It was to continue through to
 a complete deliverance, culminating in the possession of the
 promised land. This movement stands as a type of the de-
 liverance of God's people in the final movement connected
 with the closing work of God in the earth. The message
 which called a people out of the world, separating them from
38          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

 darkness and confusion, and turning their footsteps toward
 the eternal kingdom, is not a movement that will leave its
 adherents by the way with the goal unreached. God has
 called us "out" by this message, that He might lead us "in."
 Only unbelief, murmuring, and faint-heartedness can keep
 those connected with this movement from entering in, as in
the case of Israel of old.
     2. The choosing of Joshua to take the place of Moses, was
not a hasty emergency measure. Joshua had been associated
with Moses many years, and had developed marked evidences
 of leadership, wisdom, and faith. He had been tried and
 tested, and found true to his charge. He had been given to
 understand that he would at a future time be a leader of
 Israel. (See Ex. 17: 14.) He was one of the two spies who
 brought back a good report of his expedition into Canaan,
 and turned a threatened apostasy and revolt into a victory
 for God. These long years of association with Moses while
 passing through severe experiences were a preparation for
 future successful leadership.
     3. "During the sojourn in the wilderness he had acted
 as prime minister to Moses, and by his quiet, unpretending
 fidelity, his steadfastness when others wavered, his firmness
 to maintain the truth in the midst of danger, he had given
 evidence of his fitness to succeed Moses, even before he was
 called to the position by the voice of God."—"Patriarchs and
Prophets," pp. 481, 482.
     4. " 'By faith the walls of Jericho fell down.' Heb. 11: 30.
Whose faith? To some extent it was the faith of the people,
who marched round them day by day in full assurance that
 God would not fail. But Joshua and Caleb preeminently were
deeply concerned in the wonderful result.
    "To the citizens the action of the Israelite invaders must
have appeared incomprehensible and even ludicrous. What
do these feeble folk? But God's people were being daily
trained in patience, obedience, and humility. Let God per-
form all things for you! Many strongholds of the enemy
which now remain obstinate would fall if only all the church
would encompags them in faith."— Meyer.
    5. "The great victory that God had gained for them had
made the Israelites self-confident. Because He had promised
them the land of Canaan, they felt secure, and failed to realize
that divine help alone could give them success. Even Joshua
laid his plans for the conquest of Ai, without seeking counsel
from God."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 493.
    6. "The deadly sin that led to Achan's ruin had its root
in covetousness, of all sins one of the most common and the
most lightly regarded. While other offenses meet with de-
tection and punishment, how rarely does the violation of the
tenth commandment so much as call forth censure. The
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  39

enormity of this sin, and its terrible results, are the lessons
of Achan's history."— Id., p. 496.
    "Everywhere its slimy track is seen. It creates discon-
tent and dissension in families; it excites envy and hatred in
the poor against the rich; it prompts the grinding oppression
of the rich toward the poor. And this evil exists not in the
world alone, but in the church. . . . Many a man comes
statedly to church, and sits at the table of the Lord, while
among his possessions are hidden unlawful gains, the things
that God has cursed. For a goodly Babylonish garment, mul-
titudes sacrifice the approval of conscience and their hope of
heaven. Multitudes barter their integrity, and their capa-
bilities for usefulness, for a bag of silver shekels. The cries
of the suffering poor are unheeded; the gospel light is hindered
in its course; the scorn of worldlings is kindled by practices
that give the lie to the Christian profession; and yet the
covetous professor continues to heap up treasures. Will a
man rob God? Yet ye have robbed Me,' saith the Lord."
— Id., p. 497.

view the matter;. his sin was one of common occurrence. The
psalmist says that 'he spake unadvisedly with his lips.' To
human judgment this may seem a light thing; but if God dealt
so severely with this sin in His most faithful and honored
servant, He will not excuse it in others. The spirit of self-
exaltation, the disposition to censure our brethren, is dis-
pleasing to God. Those who indulge in these evils cast
doubt upon the work of God, and give the skeptical an excuse
for their unbelief."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 420.
    2. "Courageous, resolute, and persevering, prompt, incor-
ruptible, unmindful of selfish interests in his care for those
committed to his charge, and, above all, inspired by a living
faith in God,— such was the character of the /man divinely
chosen to conduct the armies of Israel in their entrance upon
the promised land."— Id., p. 481.
