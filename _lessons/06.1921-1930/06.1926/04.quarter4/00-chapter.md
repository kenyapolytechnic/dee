     We have just completed an extended study of the life and teachings
 of Jesus, and have felt afresh the spiritual uplift of that life and in-
struction. "The Acts of the Apostles" is the simple title given the
 hook we shall now study. If has been suggested that this book might
appropriately be named, "The Acts of the Holy Spirit." In it, as in
no other book in the Bible, is found the manifestation of the mighty
power, the wonderful working, of the third Person of the Godhead.
    Christ declared, "When He, the Spirit of truth, is come," "He sha'l
not speak of Himself." John 16: 13.
  • "Luke, the beloved physician," is the writer of the book of Acts.
Acts 1: 1; Luke 1: 1-4; Col. 4: 14.•
    It is supposed to have been written about A. D. 65. • We should con-
stantly keep in mind that the events recorded in the .book of Acts took
place in the years immediately following Pentecost, the time of the
"former rain." Then the gospel was carried to all the world in one
short generation (Col. 1: 23). Under the ministration of the Spirit,
the gospel of the last message will likewise be carried to all the world
in one generation.



    SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON HELP

                       T     HE Sabbath school lesson help for this
                             quarter and for the first six months of 1927

                        every lesson note refers to this book. Quite a
                        full history of the early church and the apostolic
                        dispensation is set forth in this remarkably in-
                        teresting work. It is a most encouraging ac-
                        count of the church at, work,,and a very strong
                        help to every believer.
                            The thorough student of these lessons will
                        wish to secure a copy of the lesson help prior to

the primary lesson. Read pages 25-30 of "The Acts of the Apostles."
    3. Study Questions 5-9, and notes. Children may read paragraphs 4-6 of the
primary lesson. Read pages 31-34 of"The Acts of the Apostles."

primary lesson.
                                  THE LESSON
    1. What special theme is the basis of every chapter of this book?
    NOTE.—It is not the dreams, the theories, the speculations the
prophecies, or the doctrines of men, but the acts of the apostles,—their
deeds,—which more than all else, are the subject of every chapter of
this book.
    The molt wonderful fact that will face us all through the book of
Acts is that Jesus intrusted to converted sinners the mission of carry-
ing on to completion the -work He had begun. The entire book is a
record of what He accomplished through fallible man by the preaching
of the Word and the power of the Holy Spirit in the .early rain, and.
is an example of what He can and will d6 in the, time of the latter rain.
    2. What had the author formerly written? Acts 1:1.                 •
                                       3
       3. What "treatise" is here referred to?—Answer: The Gospel of
  Luke. Luke 1:1-4.
      4. Of what did Luke say he had written? Acts 1: 1, 2.
    • 5. What are the principal.topics of the first chapter of the book
  of Acts?—Answer: The five chief topics are as follows:._
       a. The introduction. Verses 1-5.
       b. The ascension. Verses 6-11.
       c. The upper chamber. Verses 12-14.
      d. Peter speaks of Judas. Verses 15-20.
      C. The election of Matthias. Verses 21-26.
          How long did Christ remain with His disciples after His resur-
  rection? What kind of proofs did He give to demonstrate that He
  was truly the Son of God? Acts 1: 3.
      7. As He met with the disciples, what special command did Jesus
  give? What was the promise of the Father? Verses 4, 5.
      8. What hope was still lingering in the hearts of the disciples?
  How did Jesus reply to their questions? Verses 6, 7.
      NOTE,—"Let all our brethren and sisters beware of anyone who
  would set a time for the Lord to fulfill His word in regard to His com-
  ing, or in regard to any other promise He has made of special signifi-
  cance. . . . False teachers may appear to be very zealous for the work
  of God, and may expend means to bring their theories before the world
,and the church; but as they mingle error with truth, their message is
 one of deception, and will lead souls into false paths. They are to be
 met, and opposed, not because they are bad men, but because they are
 teacheis of falsehood, and are endeavoring to put upon falsehood the
 stamp of truth.
      "What a pity it is that men will go to such pains to discover some
 theory of error, when there is_a whole storehouse of precious gems of
 truth by which the people might be enriched in the most holy faith.
 Instead of teaching truth, they let their imagination dwell upon that
 which is new and strange, and throw themselves out of harmony with
 those whom God is using to bring the people-up upon the platform
 of truth."--"Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel Workers," p. 55.
      9. What promise was given? What were the disciples to become
_when clothed with power? Verse 8.
     11-ova.—The promise of the Holy Spirit- is also recorded in John
     --
16:7; 15:26. In His words of farewell Jesus said, "Ye shall be wit-
 nesses unto Me both in Jerusalem [at home], and in all Judea [neigh-
 borhood], and in Samaria [near-by countries], and unto the uttermost
 part of the earth [foreign mission fields]." The object of the book
 of Acts is to record how this promise was fulfilled.
 • 10. What is a witness expected to do? How extensive was the
 apostles' commission? Mark 16:15. How far -had the gospel been
 preached before Paul died? Col. 1:23.
     NOTE.—"The gospel commission is the great missionary charter of
 Christ's kingdom. The disciples were to work earnestly for souls,
 giving to all the invitation of mercy. They were not to wait for the
 people to come tb them; they were to go to the people with their mea-
                                   [4]
sage. . . . When Christ said to the disciples, Go forth in My name to
gather into the church all who believe, He plainly set before them the
necessity of maintaining simplicity. The less ostentation and show,
the greater would be their influence for good. The disciples were to
speak with the same simplicity with which Christ had spoken. They
were to impress upon their hearers the lessons He had taught them."
—"The Acts of the Apostles," pp. 28, 29.
    "Our confession of His faithfulness is Heaven's chosen agency for
revealing Christ to the world. We are to acknowledge His grace as
made known through the holy men of old; but that which will be most
effectual is the testimony of our own experience. We are witnesses
for God as we reveal in ourselves .the working of a power that is
divine."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 347.
   -11. DesCribe the manner of Christ's ascension. What assurance
did the angels give the belivvers? Acts 1:9-11.
    12. Where did this event take place? Luke 24: 50, 51.
   6
   . How many times is the second coming of Christ said to be
spoken of in the New Testament?
   NoTE.—"The second coming of Christ is said to be mentioned 318
times in the 260 chapters of the New Testament, and it occurs once in
every ,twenty-five verses from Matthew to Revelation."—"Studies in
the Bbok of Acts," Grace Saxe, p. 7.
   14. After the ascension of Jesus, to what place did the disciples
return? Who are mentioned as being together in the upper room?
What prayer season then began? 'What was the spirit of the occasion?
Acts 1: 12-14.
    Nom—This is the last time that Mary, the mother of Jesus, is
mentioned in the Scriptures.,
    "As the disciples waited for the fulfillment of the promise, they
humbled their hearts in true repentance, and confessed their un-
belief. . .
   "The disciples prayed with intense earnestness for a fitness to meet
men, and in their daily intercourse •to speak words that would lead
sinners to Christ. Putting away all differences, all desire for the
supremacy, they came close together in Christian fellowship. They
drew nearer and nearer to God, and as they did this, they realized
what a privilege had been theirs in being permitted to associate so
closely with Christ. 'Sadness filled their hearts as they thought of how
many times they had grieved Him by their slowness of comprehension,
their failure to understand the lessons that, for - their good, He was
trying to teach them.
    "These days of preparation were days of deep heart searching.
The disciples felt their spiritual need, and cried to the Lord for the
holy unction that was to fit them for the work of soul saving. They did
not ask for a blessing for themselves merely. They were weighted
with the burden of the salvation of souls. They realized that the gos-
pel was to be carried to ,the world; and they claimed the power that
Christ had promised."—"The Acts of the Apqstles," pp. 36, 37.
                                   15]
    15. What did Peter do? To what scripture did Peter refer? What
reference did he make to Judas? Verses 1540.
    16. What business was necessary at that time? By what method
was the choice made? Verses 21-26.
    NOTE.—"From these scriptures we learn that the Lord has certain
men to fill certain positions. God will teach His people to move care-
fully, and to make wise choice of men who will_not betray sacred
trusts. If in Christ's day the believers needed to be guarded in ,their
 choice of men for positions of responsibility, we who are living in this
time certainly need to move with great discretion. We are to present
every case before God, and in earnest prayer ask Him to choose for
us."—"Testimonies," vol. 9, p. 264.
    17. How many attended this prayer meeting and also the business
meeting? Verse 15.
                        PERSONAL APPLICATION
   Did you attend the last prayer meeting .or business meeting in your' •
church? If not, why not?
   What instruction given in this chapter applies to me?
   What errors should I avoid?
   What promises may I claim?
   For what should I pray?

                               LESSON 2
                 THE HOLY SPIRIT GIVEN
                        - October 9, 1926
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Acts 2: 1-21.
MEMORY VERSE: "Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be
  saved." Acts 2: 21.
LESSON HELPS: "The Acts of the Apostles," pp. 35-41, 47-56; "Testi-
   monies," vol. 7, pp. 31-33; "The Great Controversy," pp. 611, 612,
                       SETTING OF THE LESSON
    After Jesus ascended into heaven, the disciples returned to Jeru-
salem and sought earnestly to prepare their hearts for the outpouring
of the Holy Spirit. For ten days they prayed, confessing their sins,
and making every wrong right, seeking the promised blessing. The
Feast of the Harvest, or the Feast of Weeks, was celebrated each year
by the Jews. It occurred on the fiftieth day from the offering of the
first fruits. The first fruits were offered on the second day of the
Feast of Unleavened Bread, or the Passover, and inasmuch as the Feast
of the Harvest occurred fifty days later, it was called the day of Pent&
cost, as "Pentecost" means fiftieth.' The resurrection of Jesus took
place on the day the first fruits were offered. Pentecost therefore
came fifty days from the resurrection of Jesus, and ten days after His
ascension. .          •
                      Suggestions for Daily Family Study
    1. Read the "Setting•of the Lesson" and the.Lesson Scripture. Drill on the
memory verse each day.
    2. Study Questions 1-5, and notes. Children may read paragraphs 1-4 of the
primary lesson. Read selected portions from the Lesson Helps.
                                     [6 ]
    3. Study Questions 6-9. Children may read paragraphs 5 and 6 of the

    5. Study Questions 13-17, and notes. Children may read paragraphs 7 and 8
of the primary lesson. Read of an experience similar to that of Pentecost, yet to
come, in "The Great Controversy," pp. 611, 612.
    6. Let the story of the lesson be told, each member of the family taking part.
Discuss the personal application of the lesson.
    7. Review the lesson by using questions in the various lesson papers.

                                THE LESSON
    1. What is the meaning of the word "Pentecost"?—Answer: Lit
el ally, "fiftieth," that is, the fiftieth day from the second day of un- •
leavened bread. Lev. 23 : 15, 16.                  •
    2. At what time of year did this feast come? How many days were
there between the Passover and Pentecost? Lev. 23: 9-16; Deut.
16: 9, 10.
     3. How many disciples Were gathered together in Jerusalem after
the resurrection of Jesus? -Acts 1: 15.,
     NOTE.—"For forty days Christ remained on the earth, preparing
the disciples for the work before them, and explaining that which here-
tofore they had been unable to comprehend. . . . During these days
that Christ spent with His disciples, they gained a new experience.
. . . They began to realize the nature and extent of their work, to see
that they were to proclaim to the world-the• truths intrusted to them."
—"The Acts of the Apostles," pp. 26, 27.
     "As the disciples waited for the fulfillment of the promise, they
humbled their hearts in true repentance, and confessed their unbelief.
 . . . They reproached themselves for their misapprehension of the
Saviour. Like a procession, scene after scene of His wonderful life
passed before them. As they meditated upon His pure, holy life, they
felt that no toil would be too hard, no sacrifice too great, if only they
could bear witness in their lives to the loveliness of Christ's chara•eter."
—Id., p. 36.
      4. Where were the believers on the day of Pentecost? What sud-
denly took place? Acts 2: 1-3.                        •
      NOTE.—"Christ's ascension to heaven was the signal that His fol-
lowers were to receive the promised blessing. For this they were to
wait before they entered upon their work. When Christ passed within
 the heavenly gates, He was enthroned amidst the adoration of the
angels. As soon as this ceremony was completed, the Holy Spirit de-
 scended upon the disciples in rich currents, and Christ was indeed glori-
 fied, even with the glory which He had with the Father from all
 eternity. The Pentecostal outpouring was. Heaven's communication
 that the Redeemer's inauguration was accomplished. According to His
 promise He had sent the Holy Spirit from heaven to His followers, as
 a token that He had, as priest and king, received all authority in
 heaven and on earth, and was the Anointed One over His people."—
 "The Acts of the Apostles," lip. 38, 39.
      5. How were the disciples affected? As noon as they were filled
 with the Spirit, what did they do? Verse 4.
                                    [71
      6. Of what promise was this experience a fulfillment? Luke 24:
  49; Acts 1: 4.
      7. What had Jesus said of the Comforter, the Holy Spirit? John
  14: 16, 17.
      8. Where is God's earthly dwelling place now? 2 Cor. 6: 16; Isa.
  57: 15.
      9. What is said of the man in whom the Spirit of God dwells?
  What of one in whom the Spirit does not dwell? Rom. 8: 9, 10.
      10. How long should the Spirit.thus abide in us, according to the
  promise? John 14: 16./
      11. Who dwelt at Jerusalem at the time spoken of in this lesson?
  How did all these hear what was spoken? Acts 2: 5:8.
      NOTE.—"Dhring the dispersion, the Jews had been scattered to al-
  most every part of the inhabited world, and in their exile they had
  learned to speak various languages. Many of these Jews were on this
  occasion in Jerusalem, attending the religious festivals then in prog-
  ress. Every known tongue was represented by those assembled. This
  diversity of languages would have been a great hindrance to the proc-
  lamation of the gospel; God therefore in a miraculous manner supplied
  the deficiency of the apostles. The Holy Spirit did for them that
  which they could not have accomplished for themselves in a lifetime."
  —"The Acts of the Apostles," pp. 39, 40.
      12. 'How many nationalities are mentioned as hearing the message
I in their own tongue? From this experience at Pentecost, what may we
  decide is the purpose of - God in bestowing the gift, of tongues?
  Verses 9-11.
      NOTE.—"The gift of tongues on the day of Pentecost was the gift
  of sane, sensible, connected, convincing, and converting speech. Men
  and women of all lands,—and they were there from everywhere,—
  heard the gospel of Christ in their own tongues, and three thousand
  people were 'swept into the kingdom. The gift of tongues to-day is
  more like the confusion of tongues at the building of the tower of
  Babel, and like the Babelites these modern-tongue apostles are going
  everywhere trying fo find some use for their so-called gift. Tie great-
  est miracle of the ages, and the miracle before which all outward mani-
  festations and demonstration sink into absolute insignificance, is the
  miracle of 'reborn' men and women."—J. E. Brown, in "The Spirit-
  Filled Life."
      13. While some were amazed, how did others derisively pretend to
  account for what they saw and heard? Verses 12, 13.
      NomE.—"The priests,. determined to account for the miraculous
  power of the disciples in some natural way, declared that they were
  drunken from partaking largely of the new wine prepared for the
  feast Some of the most ignorant of the people present seized upon
  this suggestion as the truth, but the more intelligent knew it to be
  false; and those who understood the different languages testified to
  the accuracy with which these languages were used by the disciples."
  —"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 40.
      14. What did Peter say in reply to this, accusation? Verses 14, 15.
                                  [ 8 ]
      NOTE.—The "third hour of the day" was 9 a. In., according to
  Jewish reckoning. This was the hour of morning prayer. Before this
  hour, the Jdws did not partake of food, and on festal days, such 'as
  Pentecost, they abstained from food and drink till the sixth hour, noon.
  Peter refers to the early hour as proof that the charge of drunkenness
  was contrary to all probability. (Compare 1 Thess. 5: 7.)_
      When the Lord is working in power, there are those who make light
  of His Rresence, and mock when they should pray. In the most.solemn
  meetings, some will laugh, whisper, and in other ways show their con-
  tempt and indifference. It was so at Pentecost. There were 'those
  who said with a sneer, "It is nothing ;these men are drunken."
      15. To what prophecy did Peter refer? What did he say of /its
  fulfillment? Acts 2: 16-18.
      NOTE.—"Those only who are constantly receiving frgsh supplies of
• grace, will have power proportionate to their daily need arid their
  ability to use that power. Instead of looking forward to some future
  time when, through a special endowment of spiritual power, they will
  receive a ,miraculous fitting up for soul winning, they are yielding
  themselves daily to God, that He may make them vessels meet for His
  use. Daily they are improving the opportunities for service that lie
  within their reach. Daily they are witnessing for the Master wherever
  they may be, whether in some humble sphere of labor in the home, or
  in a public field of usefulness."—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 55.
  ' 16. Where did Peter say the sign's,mentioned by Joel would appear?
  How many of these signs were seen at Pentecost? Verses 19, 20.
      17. What glorious promise is given? Verse 21.
      NOTE.—"Every worker who follows the example of Christ will be
  prepared to receive and use the power that God has promised to His
  church for the ripening of earth's harvest. Morning by morning, as the
  heralds of the gospel kneel before the Lord and renew their vows of
  consecration to Him, He will grant them the presence of His Spirit,
  with its reviving, sanctifying power. As they go -forth to the day's
  duties, they have the assurance that the unseen agency of the Holy
  Spirit enables them to be 'laborers together with God.' "—"The Acts of
  the Apostles," p. 56.
                    - PERSONAL APPLICATION
    Am I filled with the Holy Spirit?

                        SETTING OF THE LESSON
  ' Every known tongue was represented in the multitude that had
come to Jerusalem to the yearly feast. This confusion might have been
a great hindrance to the spread of the gospel, but the Holy Spirit en-
abled the disciples so to speak that every man heard what was said "in
his own tongue." The priests and rulers tried to bring the apostles into
disfavor by accusing them of being drunken, but Peter began to speak
to the people very earnestly, showing them the meaning of what had
taken place. This lesson is a continuation of Peter's sermon.
                      Suggestions for Daily Family Study
    1. Read the "Setting of the Lesson" and the Lesson Scripture. Drill on the
memory verse each day.
    2. Study Questions 1-4, and notes. Children may read paragraphs 1-4 of •the
primary lesson. Read pages 41 and 42 of the Lesson Help.
    3. Study.Questions 5-7, and notes. Children may read paragraphs 5-7 of the
primary lesson. Read pages 43 and 44 of the Lesson Help.
    4. Study Questions 8-12, and notes. Children may answer the questions in
paragraphs 1-7 of the primary lesson. Read pages 45 and 46 of the Lesson Help.
    5. Study Questions 13-17, and notes. Children may read paragraphs 8-10 of
the primary lesson.
    6. Note the teaching of the lesson on the state of the dead, the resurrection,
conviction, repentance, baptism, and the gift of the Spirit. See that the children
comprehend the essential points.
    7. Review the lesson by using questions. Discuss the questions under "Per-
sonal Application."
                                 THE LESSON
   1. In speaking to the Jews, what does Peter say of the way God
showed approval of Jesus of Nazareth? Acts 2: 22. ,
   2. What did he charge them with doing? Verse 23.
   NOTE.—This text is rendered in the American Revised Version:
"Him, being delivered up by the determinate counsel and foreknowl-
edge of God, ye by the hand of lawless men did crucify and slay."
    3. What does Peter declare God had done? Why was it not pos-
sible for death to hold°Christ captive? Verse 24.
    NoTE.—"Could one sin have been found in Christ, had He in one
particular yielded to Satan to escape the terrible torture, the enemy
of God and man would have triumphed. Christ bowed His head and
died, but He held fast His faith and His submission to God."—"The
Desire of Ages," p. 761.
    4. Will death be able to hold the righteous dead? If you should
die, would it be able to hold you? John 5: 24, 25; 1 Thess.,4: 14.
    5. How had David foretold the resurrection? Acts 2: 25-28; Ps.
16: 8-11.
    NOTE.—David here voices beautifully the hope of every one who
dies fully trusting the Lord. It was written beforehand of Christ,
"My flesh also shall rest in hope," because it was impossible that He,
the Life-giver, should be holden of death. He passed through the por-
tals of the tomb, and "tasted death for every man." But He "arose
triumphant" over the foes of all mankind, death ; and "at the last
trump," He will call forth the sleeping saints, who shall arise from
their dusty beds "with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads,"
and "sorrow and sighing shall flee pv-ny."            ._
                                   10 ]
    6. How did Peter apply this prophecy? Of whom was David writ-
ing? Acts 2: 29-32.
    NOTE.—To show that this prophecy did not refer to David himself,
but to Christ, the "Holy One," Peter appealed to the fact that David
was still dead and in his tomb. Jesus had been raised without seeing
corruption, and was now exalted at the right hand of God, shedding
forth the Pentecostal blessing promised when He ascended.
    "Peter did not refer'to the teachings of Christ to prove his posi-
tion, because he knew that the prejudice of his hearers was so great
that his words on this subject would be of no effect. Instead, he spoke
to them of David, who was regarded by the Jews as one of the patri-
archs of their-nation."—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 41.
    7. When Christ ascended, where did,He go? For how long a:     ime?
How did Peter connect Him with the gracious outpouring of the
Spirit? Verses 33-35.
    8. Where was Jesus when He was revealed to Stephen? What sig-
nificance do you attach to the expression so often used in the Scrip-
tures, "at His right hand"? Acts 7: 55, 56.
    9. Did David go to heaven when he died? What became- of him at
his death? Acts 2: 34, 29.
    10. In closing his sermon, what assuring conclusion did Peter
draw? Verse 36.
    11. What effect did Peter's sermon have on the people? What in-
quiry did they make? Verse 37.
   ,NOTE.—"Some of tliose who listened to the apostles had taken an
active part in the condemnation and-death of Christ. Their voices had
mingled with the rabble in calling for His crucifixion. : . . Now they
heard the disciples declaring that it was the Son of God who had been
crucified. Priests and rulers trembled. Conviction and anguish seized
the people. . . . Among those who listened to the disciples were devout
Jews, who were sincere in their belief. The power that accompanied
the words of the speaker convinced them that Jesus was indeed the
Messiah."—"The Acts of the Apostles," pp. 42, 43.
    12. -What reply did Peter make? Will this answer apply to all who,
are convicted of sin? In whose name are all to be baptized? For what
purpose? What gift is prOmised? Verse 38. (See also Matt. 28': 19.)
    NOTE.—Cicero says the words of Pericles left stings in the minds of
his hearers. Luke says that when the multitude heard the words of
Peter, they were pricked in their heart. The words in the American
Revised Version of the sixteenth and seventeenth verses of the fifty-
first psalm are these:
     "Thou delightest not in sacrifice; else would I give it:
         Thou hast no pleasure in burnt offering.
       The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit:
       A broken and a contrite heart, 0 God, Thou wilt not despise."
   "Contrite" comes from the Latin word "contritus," and means lit-
erally crushed, bruised, ground to powder. A mind that is stung, a
                                 [ 11 ]
heart that is pricked, or broken, or bruised, are expressions denoting
contrition, an awakened conscience.
    13. How inclusive is the promise of the gift of the Spirit? From
what did Peter exhort them to save themselves? Acts 2: 39, 40.
    NOTE.—"The disciples were to begin their work where they were.
The hardest and most unpromising field was not to be passed by. So
every one of Christ's workers is to begin where he is. In our own
families may be souls hungry for sympathy, starving for the bread of
life. There may be children to be trained for Christ. There are
heathen at our very doors. Let us do faithfully the work that is near-
est. Then       our efforts be extended as far as God's hand may lead
the way./The work of many may appear to be restricted by circum-
stances; but wherever it is, if performed with faith and diligence it
will be felt to the uttermost parts of the earth. Christ's work when
upon earth appeared to be confined to a narrow field, but multitudes
from all'lands heard His message. God often uses the simplest means
to accomplish the greatest results. It is His plan that every part of
His work shall depend on every other part, as a wheel within a wheel,
all acting in harmony. The humblest worker, moved by the Holy
Spirit, will touch invisible chords, whose. vibrations will ring to the
ends of the earth, and make melody through eternal ages."—"The De-
sire of Ages)" pp. 822, 823.
    14. Who, and how many, were added to the Lord that day?
Verse 41.
    NOTE.—When a person is converted, he is joined, "added," to the
Lord. Acts 5: 14. "I am the vine, ye are the branches," Jesus said.
The converted one also unites with God's people, and in this sense may
be said to be "added unto them."
    15. What were the results of the day's experience? Acts 2: 42, 43.
    16. How were the believers affected with reference to their earthly
possessions? Verses 44, 45.
    17. What did the 'believers do daily? What did the Lord do daily?
Verses 46, 47.
                       PERSONAL APPLICATION
    Have I repented? Have I received remission of sins?
    Have I been baptized? Have I received the gift of the Holy
Ghost?      •                              ‘•
    What personal' lesson may I learn from the experience of Christ on
the cross?
    What comfort in death may I receive from this lesson?       ,
    How many souls have been "added to the Lord" through my in-
strumentality?

                          SETTING OF THE LESSON
      "A short time after the descent of the Holy Spirit, and immediately
  after a season of earnest prayer, Peter and John, going up to the
  temple to worship, saw at the gate Beautiful a, cripple, forty years of
  age, whose life, from his birth, had been one of pain and infirmity.
  This unfortunate man had long desired to see Jesus, that he might be
  healed; but he was almost helpless, and was far removed from the
. scene of the great Physician's labors. His pleadings at last induced
  some friends to bear him to the gate of the temple, but upon arriving
  there, he found that the One upon whom his hopes were centered, had
  been put to a cruel death.
      "His disappointment excited the sympathy of those who knew for
   how long he had eagerly hoped to be healed by Jesus, and daily they
  brought him to the temple, in order that passers-by might be induced
   by pity to give him a trifle to relieve his wants."—"The Acts of the
  Apostles," pp. 57, 58.
                          Suggestions for Daily Family Study

     7. Review the lesson by using questions. Discuss the questions under "Per-
 sonal Application."
                                    THE LESSON
     1. How did the believers spend much of their time after Pentecost?
 What was the result of this continued labor for souls? Acts 2: 46, 47.
     NorrE.New members were added to the church "daily." To what,
 think you, was this increase due?
     2. How did they provide for the physical needs of believers?
 Verses 44, 45.
     Nova.—"'Had all things common.' They were members of one
 family and held things in common as members of a family do. Every-
 thing was for the good of all. No one said that anything 'was his
 own.' Some sold of their possessions, and distributed the money as
                                        [ 13
  very man had need, whether citizens or strangers. Some were poor,
some may have suffered loss by being driven from their homes on ac-
count of their religion. Some were strangers without employment.
Great numbers had come from distant countries, and were remaining to
know more about the new religion. There was no compulsion to sell
their property, but the impulse of their own loving generous hearts.
`Parted them to all,' riot to friends only, but 'as every man had need.' "
—Peloubet.
    3. With what were their hearts filled? What gave them faVor with
all the people? Verse 46, last part; 47, first part.
    4. What is the second named fruit of the Holy Spirit? Gal. 5: 22.
    5. With what was Jesus anointed? Heb. 1: 9.
    NOTE.—"We need to praise God more 'for His goodness, and for
His wonderful works to the children of men.' Ps. 107: 8. Our devo-
tional exercises should not consist wholly in asking and receiving.
Let us not be always thinking of our wants, and never of the benefits
we receive. We do not pray any too much, but we are too sparing of
giving thanks. We are the constant recipients of God's mercies, and,
yet how little gratitude we express, how little we praise Him for what
He has done for us."—"Steps to Christ," pp. 107, 108.
    6. Who saw Peter and John going into the temple one dart() pray?
Why was this man there? For what did he ask? How did Peter arouse
expectation in the heart of this poor man? Acts 3: 1-5.
    7. What shows the pecuniary poverty of Peter and John? What
shows their spiritual wealth? How was the lame man healed? Which
is greater, that which the man asked for, or that which was imparted
to him? Verses 6,7.
    NoTE.—"Petergave the lame man two thiings, each of which was
worth far more than silver and gold. He gave him the power to earn
his own living.     . . Then Peter bestowed a far greater gift than
this,—he brought him to the Lord Jesus, into the Christian life. Jesus
in all His healings gave the higher blessing with the lower. He always
did more than heal the body. That was, the lesser part of the cure."
—Peloubet.
    8. What was the man's conduct after his healing? How did this
miracle affect the people? Verses 8-11.
    9. What shows that a wonderful change had been wrought in
Peter since the trial and condemnation of Christ? Verse 12. (Com-
pare Matt. 26: 69-75.)
    10. In what words did Peter disclaim all credit for this miracle?
To whom did he direct the attention of the people? Acts 3: 12, 13,
first part.
    11. What awful charge did he make against the Jews standing by?
What endearing names did he use in referring to Jesus? Who was
the murderer referred to in verse 14? Verses 13-15.           •
    12. Through what channel did he say healing. power came to the
cripple? How- did he seem to soften the charge against the priests?
                                    14
What reference does he again make to the prophecy concerning Jesus?
Verses 16-18.
    13. What did Peter then exhort the people to do? What would be
the result if they would repent? Verse 19.
    14. Do men need to repent of sin committed ignorantly? Lev.
4: 27, 28.
    NoPE.—"I saw that none could share thw'refreshing,' unless they
obtain the victory over every besetment, over pride; selfishness, love of
the world, and over every wrong word and action. We should, there-
fore, be drawing nearer and nearer to the Lord, and be earnestly seek-
ing that preparation necessary to enable us to stand in the battle in
the day of the Lord. Let all remember that God is holy, and that none
but holy beings can ever dwell in His presence."—"Early Writings,"
P. 7j•
    15. Who does Peter say will be sent to His people? How long will
Christ remain in heaven? Who has spoken of the time when all things
will be restored? Acts 3: 20, 21.
    16. What scripture did Peter then quote? Where is it fouhd?
What does he say will be the fate of the man who does not accept
Christ? Verses 22, 23.
    17. How many of the prophets spoke of these things? What, was
the relation of Peter's hearers to the prophets? Verses 24, 25.
    18. How had God specially favored the Jews of Petees day?
 Verse 26.

    What did Peter have to give that made the cripple whole? Do I
have that power to give to otheks? If not, why not? ,
    What do I need to-day in my Christian experience more than any-
thing else?
    Which do I regard of greater value—the .power of Christ in my
life, or much silver and gold?          •
    What does preparation for the Lord's coming involve? Aets 3: 19.

12, first clause; 4: 1, first clause.                _
    2. How was it abruptly terminated? Acts 4: 1.
    NOTE.—"Inside the sacred area [of the temple] the Jewish law was
supreme, and Jewish penalties were enacted. In order, therefore, that
the temple might be duly protected the priests watched in three places,
and the Levites in twenty-one places, in addition to all their other
duties connected with the offering of sacrifices and the details of pub-
lic worship. These guards discharged the duties of a sacred or temple
police, and their captain was called the captain of the temple."—"The
Expositor's Bible," vol. 1, p. 175.             •
    The Sadducees were not only a religions, but a political party.
They formed a part of the Jewish Sanhedrin. They were the free
thinkers of the day. They stood in direct opposition to the Pharisees.
They believed that" the Scriptures did not teach a future life, and that
angels and spirits, did not exist. They possessed wealth, influence, and
power, and lived's, life of ease and luxury. The humble, self-denying
life of Jesus did not appeal to them, and they despised Him and His
followers.
    3. What truth did the apostles preach? What was done with them
after Peter had spoken to the people in Solomon's Porch?! What
fruit was borne by Peter's sermon? Verses 2-4.
    4. Name the men and the different classes that assembled, at the
trial of the apostles. Verses 5, 6.
    NoTE.—Rulers, elders, scribes, temple police, high priest, John and
Alexander, not mentioned elsewhere, were present to try the apostles
on this occasion. The Sanhedrin, when complete, consisted of seventy-
one members;' but twenty-three constituted a' quorum competent to
transact business. The trial of the followers of Jesus was conducted
by , the same men who had condemned their Lord. John 11: 49;
18: 12-14.
    5. What question was first asked the disciples? Acts 4: 7.
    NoTE.—"The Sanhedrin were sitting as a board of inquisitors.
They did' not deny the miracle which had been wrought. We are
scarcely fit judges of the attitude of mind occupied by an Easterner,
specially by an Eastern Jew of those earlier ages, when confronted
                                      [161
with a miracle. He did not deny the facts brOught under his notice.
He was too well acquainted with magic and the strange performances
of its professors to do so. He merely inquired as to the sources of the
power, whether they were divine or diabolical."—"The Expositor's
Bible," vol. 1, p. 188.

respectful reply? Verse 8.                        '
   7. What are the principal points in Peter's reply? Verses 8-12.
  - NOTE.—"Than Christ, 'there is none other name under heaven given
among men, whereby we must be saved.' Through faith we receive
the grace of God; but faith is not our Saviour. It earns nothing. It
is the hand by which we lay hold upon Christ, and appropriate His
merits, the remedy for sin. And we can not, even repent withbut the
aid of the Spirit of God."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 175.
'   8. What caused the persecutors to marvel? What further helped
the apostles? Verses 13, 14.
    9: What question did the Sanhedrin discuss among themselves?
What did they decide? In, accordance with this decision, what 'com-
mand was given the apostles? Verses 15-18.
  - 10. When Peter and John heard their command, what reply did
they make? Verses 19, 20.
     NOTE.—"We are to recognize human government as as ordinance of
divine appointment, and teach obedience to it as a sacred duty, within
its legitimate sphere. But when ;its claims conflict with the claims of
God, we must obey God rather than men. God's word must be recog-
nized as above all human legislation. A 'Thus saith the Lord' is not
to be set aside for a 'Thus saith the church' or a 'Thus saith the state.'
The crown of Christ is to be lifted above the diadems of earthly
potentates."—"The Acts of the Apostles," p.
     "Conscientious men are not the enemies, but the friends, of any
government but a tyranny. They are its strength, and not its weak-
ness. Daniel, in Babylon, praying contrary to the law, was the true
friend and supporter of the government while those who, in their
pretended zeal for the law and the constitution, tvould strike down the
good man, were its real enemies. It is only when government trans,
scends its sphere, that it comes in conflict with the consciences of men."

                       SETTING OF THE LESSON
   "As the disciples proclaimed the truths of the gospel in Jerusalem,
God bore -Witness to their word, and a multitude believed. Many of
thdse early believers were immediately cut off from family and friends
by the zealous bigotry .of the Jews, and it was necessary to provide
them with food and shelter. . . . Those among the believers who had
money and, possessions, cheerfully sacrificed them to meet the emer-
gency."—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 70.

sonal Application."
                                THE LESSON
  1. What is said of the spirit of unity and benevolence
                                                  ‘      of the early
Christians? Acts 4: 32.
                                    [ 18 ]
      NOTE.—"Those who are destitute of sympathy, tenderness, and love,
 can not do Christ's work. . . . Christian benevolence and brotherly
 love must be far more abundantly shown. The words are ringing in
 my ears, ‘Dtaw together, draw together.' The solemn, sacred truth for
 this time is to unify the people of God. The desire for preeminence
 must die. One subject of emulation must swallow up all others,—who
  will most nearly' resemble Christ in character? Who will most en-
 tirely hide self in Jesus?"—"Testimonies," vol. 6, p. 42.
      2. How did the experience of being filled with the Spirit affect the
 preaching of the apostles? What theme did they continue to present?
  Verse 33.
      3. What 'plan of support was voluntarily entered upon? What was
 the effect on the believers? Verses 34, 35.
      NOTE.—"This liberality on the part of, the believers was the iesult
 of the outpouring of the Spirit. The converts to the gospel were 'of
 one heart and of one soul.' One 'Common interest controlled them,—
  the success of the mission intrusted to them; and covetousness had no
 place in their lives. Their love for their brethren and the cause they
  had espoused, was greater than their love of money and possessions.
  Their works testified that they accounted the souls of men• of higher
  value than earthly. wealth.
   • "Thus it will ever be when the Spirit of God takes possession of the
  life. Those whose hearts are filled with the love of Christ, will follow
  the example of Him who for our sake became poor, that through His
 poverty we might be made rich. Money, time, influence,—all the gifts
 they have received from God's hand,—they will value only as a means
  of advancing the work of the gospel. Thus it was in the early church;
  and when in the church of to-day it is seen that by the power of the
  Spirit the members have taken their affections from the things of the
  world, and that they are willing to make sacrifices in order that their
  fellow men may hear the gospel, the truths proclaimed will have a
  powerful influence upon the hearers."—"The Acts of the Apostles,"
- pp. 70, 71.
      4. Who is named as one who sold his land? Where was hii home?
  Verses 36, 37.
      NOTE.—With yofir concotdance trace the history of this man in the
  New Testament, noting the lessons we-may learn from him.
      The chapter division just here is unfortunate. The mean, covetous,
,hypocritical act of Ananias is so sharply contrasted with the noble,
  generous act of Barnabas, that it should not be separated from it in
  the narrative.
      5. What case of deception occurred in the community of believers?
  Acts 5: 1, 2.
      6. What evidently-was the motive of Ananias and Sapphira in thus
  doing? How did Peter reason with Ananias about his act? What
  right did he have concerning his possessions? Verses 3, 4.
      NOTE.—"In sharp contrast to the example of benevolence showm by
  the believers, was the conduct of Ananias and Sapphira., . . . They
  had been present with other believers when, after the apostles had
                                  [ 19
prayed, 'the plaCe was shaken where they were assembled together ; and
they were all filled with the Holy Ghost.' Deep conviction had rested
upon all present, and under the direct influence of the Spirit of God,
Ananias and Sapphira had made a pledge to give to the Lord the pro-
ceeds from the sale of certain property.
   "Afterward, Ananias and Sapphira grieved the Holy Spirit by
yielding to feelings of covetousness. They began to regret their prom-
ise. . . . They thought they had been too hasty, that they ought to
reconsider their decision. They talked the matter over, and decided
not to fulfill their pledge. They saw, however, that those who parted
with their possessions to supply the needs of their poorer brethren,
were held in high esteem' among the believers; and ashamed to have
their brethren know that their selfish souls grudged that which they
had solemnly dedicated to God, they deliberately decided to sell their
property, and pretend to give all the proceeds into the general fund,
but really to keep a large share for themselves. Thus they would
secure their living from the common store, and at the same time gain
the high esteem of their brethren:
   "But God hates hypocrisy and falsehood. Ananias and Sapphira
practiced fraud in their dealing with God; they lied to the Holy Spirit,
and their sin was visited with swift and terrible judgment."—"The
Acts of the Apostles," pp. 71, 72.
   7: As Ananias heard the words of Peter, what judgment of God
came upon him? How were those present and those who heard what
had happened, affected by these things? What disposal was made of
the body of Ananias? Verses 5, 6.
    8. Not long after, who came in where the apostles were? Of what
did she have no knowledge? Verse 7.
   9. What did Peter ask her? What was her reply? Verse 8.
   10. In the power of the Spirit, what solemn words did Peter then
address to her? Against whom had Ananias and Sapphira sinned?
Verse 9.
   11. 'What followed Peter's words? Verse 10.
   NOTE.—"Infinite Wisdom saw that this signal manifestation of the
wrath of God was necessary to guard the young church from becoming
demoralized. Their numbers were rapidly increasing. The church
would have been endangered if, in the rapid increase of converts, men
and women had been added who, while professing to serve God, were,
worshiping mammon. This judgment testified that men can not de-
ceive God, that He detects the hidden sin of the heart, and that He
will not be mocked. It was designed as a warning to the church, to
lead them to avoid pretense and hypocrisy, and to beware of robbing
God.
   "Not to the early church only, but to all future generations, this
example of God's hatred of covetousness, fraud, and hypocrisy, was,
given as a danger signal. It was covetousness that Ananias and
Sapphira had first cherished. The desire to retain for themselves a
part of that.which they had promised to the Lord, led them into fraud
and hypocrisy."—"The Acts of the Apostles," pp. 73, 74.
                                 [ 20 ]
    12. What resulted from this awful visitation? Verse 11.
    NOTE.—The case of Ananias was a clear case of hypocrisy. He
was not compelled to contribute his property to the common cause.
He might have kept his possessions, or he might have sold them and
kept the money. Under the influence of the Spirit, he pledged his
property, but did not have the courage to keep his pledge. Yet he
loved the appearance of paying it, and the esteem of men that would
follow. So he adopted a course of hypocrisy—attempted to serve God
and mammon.
    13. What is a root of all kinds of evil? What is the result of
cherishing this love? 1 Tim. 6: 10. Answer: The American Revised
Version reads: "For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil:
which some reaching after have been led astray from the faith, and
have pierced themselves through with many sorrows."
    14. How may we secure "great gain"? What is the danger to those
who "will be rich"? "1 Tim. 6: 6-9.
    15. What is the believer urged to do? Verse 11.
    16. What does the apostle Paul exhort us to do with a covetous dis-
position, in common with other evil things? What definition does he
give to covetousness? Col. 3: 5.
    NOTE.—"In the case of Ananias and Sapphira, the sin of fraud
against God was speedily punished. The same sin was often repeated
in the after history of the church, and is committed by many in our
time. But though it may not be attended by the visible manifestation
of God's displeasure, it is no less heinous in His sight now than in the
apostles' time. The warning has been given; God has clearly mani-
fested His abhorrence of this sin; and all who give themselves up to
hypocrisy and covetousness may be sure that they are destroying their
own souls."—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 76.
                      PERSONAL APPLICATION
    Am I like AnanOs and Sapphira in any way/
    Am I guilty of not strictly speaking the truth?
    Am I guilty of any of the sins coupled with covetousness in the
 Scriptures?

                     SETTING OF THE LESSON
   The disciples continued to tell the story of Jesus in the city of
Jerusalem. Priests and rulers were greatly surprised to hear the clear,
                                 [ 21 ]
bold preaching of the apostles. "The power of the risen Saviour had
indeed fallen on the disciples, and their work was accompanied by
signs and miracles that dailj, increased the number of believers."
       "Self is the only prison that can ever bind the soul;   -
        Love is the only angel who can bid the gates unroll."
                       Suggestions for Daily Family Study
    1. Read the "Setting of the Lesson" and the Lesson Scripture. Drill on the
memory verse each day.
    2. Study Questions 1-4, and notes. Children may read paragraphs 1 and 2
of the primary lesson. Read "The Acts of the Apostles," pp. 77-80.

primary lesson. Read "Early Writings," pp. 192-197.
    6. Tell the story of the lesson in detail, each person taking part. Topics for
discussion:
     Does the memory verse apply under all circumstances?
     What two illustrations are given of Peter's courageous spirit?
     Was Gamaliel's counsel wise or unwise?
     7. Review the lesson by using questions. Discuss questions under "Personal
Application."
                                 THE LESSON
    1. For what had the apostles prayed? Acts 4: 29,1 30.
    2. How was the prayer that signs and wonders be wrought an-
swered? Where, and in what spirit, did they meet? Acts 5: 12.
    3. What did those dare not do who were not in accord with the
believers? How were the believers regarded? Verse 13.
    NOTE.—Great fear came upon all the church,—the fear of doing
wrong. No doubt those who were not Christians were afraid to join
a people where sin was swiftly uncovered even though done in secret,
and where punishment speedily followed. Only those who were honest
in heart asked for admittance to church fellowship.             •
    4. What shows that the punishment of sin did not keep people
from being "added to the Lord"? What were some of the "signs and
wonders"? How many were healed? Verses 14-16.
    NOTE.—"The crowds gathered round them, and those who were
healed shouted the praises of God, and glorified the name of the Re-
deemer. The priests and rulers saw that Christ was extolled above
them."—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 78.
    5. How did the members of the Sanhedrin feel about these mani-
festations of God's power? What did they do? Verses 17, 18.
    6. What experience did the apostles have that night? What com-
mand did the angel give? Verses 19, 20.
    NoTE.—"There was to be no attempt made to conceal their escape.
They were to go back to the same place where their most frequent
teachings had been given before, and they were to continue the same
teaching. They are not directed to appeal to the multitude for sym-
pathy, nor to try and excite any feeling against those who had arrested
them."—"Cambridge Bible," p. 63.
    7. Relate the events of the next morning. Verses 21-23.
                                  [ 221
  8. What effect did these things have upon the Jewish officials?
What disquieting message came to them? Verses 24, 25.. —
   9. What did they then do? Of what did the high priest accuse the
apostles? Were his charges in a measure true? Verses 26-28.
   .10. What reason did Peter give for disregarding the command of
the council? In what stirring way did Peter again set forth the truth
concerning Jesus? Verses 29-32.
    NOTE.—"Although the apostles were miraculously delivered from
prison, they were not saved from examination and punishment. . .
By sending an angel to deliver them, God had given them a token of
His love, and an assurance of His presence. It was now their part to
suffer for the sake of the One whose gospel they were preaching. In
the history of prophets, andapostles, are many noble examples of loy-
alty to God. Christ's witnesses have endured imprisonment, torture,
and death itself, rather than break God's commands."—"The Acts of
the.Apostles," p. 81.
    11. What did Peter say Christ had been exalted to give? Verse 31.
    12. Who did he say were witnesses of those things? To whom did
he say God had given the Holy Spirit? Verse 32.
    NOTE.—"Let any humble disciple submit wholly to the Spirit's sov-
ereign control, and He becomes to that disciple all and more than all
that nature's forces become 10.rhumanity when guided by scientific in-
telligence,—his artist to delineate for him things divine and celestial,
his refiner and purifier to purge away the dross from character, his
giant helper to subdue all foes before him, his pilot over life's unknown
sea, his motive power in holy enterprise, his messenger between earth
and heaven, and his illuminator in the darkness of midnight and
mystery.. . . And therefore it-is that our Saviour bade His disciples
wait, tarrying until endued, for up to that point power was not theirs."
—Pierson, in "The New Acts of the Apostles," pp. 194, 195.
   13. How did Peter's words affect the council? How did God pro-
vide for the defense of His servants? Verses 33, 34.
    NoTE.—"In the council there was one man who recognized the voice
of God in the words spoken by the disciples. This was Gamaliel, a
Pharisee of goodreputation, and a man of learning and high position.
His clear intellect saw that the violent step contemplated by the
priests would lead to terrible consequences. Before addressing those
present, he requested that the prisoners be removed. He well knew the
elements he had to deal with; he knew that the murderers of Christ
would hesitate at nothing in order to carry out their purpose. He then
spoke with great deliberation and calmness."—"The Acts of the
Apostles," pp. 82, 83.
    14. What did Gamaliel admonish the council to do? What two
illustrations did he give? Verses 34-37.
    15. What was Gamaliel's final conclusion? What effect did this
address have on the council? What did they do before letting the
apostles go? Verses 38-40.
                                  [ 23 ]
    NOTE.—Paul tells us, in 2 Corinthians 11: 24, that he "was five
times flogged by the Jews. When the Jews inflicted this punishment'
the culprit was tied to a pillar in the synagogue; the executioner,
armed with a scourge of three distinct lashes, inflicted the punish-
ishment; while an official standing by read selected portions of ,the
law between each stroke. Thirteen strokes of the threefold scourge
was equivalent to the thirty-nine stripes. This was the flogging the
apostles suffered on this occasion."—"The Expositor's Bible," vol. 1,
pp. 244, 245.
    16. How did this affect the labor of the apostles? Verses 41, 42.
                        PERSONAL APPLICATION
   Am I ready to suffer shame for Christ's sake?
   If not, how shall I prepare myself for that time?
   What would I do if the answers to my prayers brought hardship?
   Do I rejoice when I am "counted worthy to suffer shame for His
name"

  pp. 197-199.
                 SETTING OF THE LESSON
    The early Christian church was made up of people of various na-
tionalities. Among these were Grecian Jews between whom and the
Jews of Palestine there had long existed a feeling of distrust and
dislike. Complaint was made that the widows of the foreign Jews
did not receive a just share of the support given to needy believers.
Naturally they would need it even more than the widows who were
among acquaintances and friends.
                        Suggestions for Daily Family Study
    1. Read the "Setting of the Lesson" and the Lesson Scripture. Drill on the
memory verse each day.

                             THE LESSON
    1. When the number of disciples had multiplied, what arose among
them? Why did they murmur? Acts 6: 1.
    NOTE. "The early church was made up of many classes of people,
of various nationalities. . . . Among those of the Hebrew faith who
were gathered at Jerusalem, were some commonly known as Grecians,
between whom and the Jews of Palestine there had long existed dis-
trust and even antagonism."—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 87.
    2. What is meant by the terms "Hebrews" and "Grecians"?
    NOTE. "A Hebrew, according to the description of the time, was
a Jew born in Palestine who spoke the Hebrew tongue, or the dialect
of it called Aramaic, and read the Scriptures in their original language,
Hebrew. A Hellenist (Grecian Jew) was a Jew of the Dispersion or a
converted foreigner, who used, not the sacred language of the race,
but Greek', and read his Bible in the Septuagint (i. e., Greek) version."
—Luckock.
    3. What steps did the apostle4 take to settle the difficulty? Verse 2.
    NOTE.—Up to this time, the apostles themselves had looked after
the distribution of assistance jo the needy. . But the number of be-
lievers had now increased to such extent that if the apostles continued
to give personal attention to this work, it would virtually mean that
they should "leave the word of God," and give all their time to business
matters. This it did not seem right to them to do.
    4: What plan did they lay before the brethren? What were re-
garded as essential qualifications in the men to be selected? Verse 3.
    NOTE.—Notice the qualifications needed-by the men to be appointed
over "this business." First, they were to be men known to be honest,
and of good reputation in the community. Second, though they were 10.
look after temporal matters, they must be "full of the Holy Ghost."
Third, they were to be wise men, those hawing an understanding of the
responsibilities to be placed upon them:
    5. What would the apostles themselves do? Verse 4.
    6. How did the believers receive the plan? Who was the first man
chosen? What is said of him? Verse 5.
    7. After the men had been chosen, how were they set apart for the
special work which they were to do? Verse 6. ,
    8. What was the result of electing these deacons? Who are es-
pecially mentioned as accepting the faith? Verse 7.
    NOTE.—"That this step was in the order of God, is revealed in the
immediate results for good that were seen. . . . This ingathering of
souls was due both to the greater freedom secured by the apostles, and
to the zeal and power shown by the seven deacons. The fact that these
brethren had been ordained for the special work of lqoking after the
needs of the poor, did not exclude them from teaching the faith. On
the contrary, they were fully qualified to instruct others in the truth,
and they engaged in the work with great earnestness and success."—

                                  [ 25 1
    9. Who of the seven was especially blessed in his• ministration?
Verse 8.
    10. What opposition did Stephen encounter? Verse 9.
    Nomi.—The Libertines were "freedmen" who had bought their
liberty from Roman slavery. They had a synagogue in which they met.
The Cyrenians were Jews from Cyrene, in North Africa. The Alexan-
drians came from Egypt, and others were present from Cilicia and dif-
ferent parts of Asia. These all disputed Stephen's claim that Jesus
was the Son of God—the Saviour of the world.
    11. 'What were Stephen's opponents not able to resist? Verse 10.
    NoTE.—"Stephen, the foremost of the seven deacons, was a man of
deep piety and broad faith. Though a Jew by birth, he spoke the
Greek language, and was familiar with the customs and manners of
the Greeks. He therefore found opportunity to preach the gospel in
the synagogues of the Greek Jews. He was very active in the cause of
Christ, and, boldly proclaimed his faith. Learned rabbis and doctors
of the law engaged in public discussion with him, confidently expect-
ing an easy victory. But 'they were not able to resist the wisdom and
the spirit by which he spake.' Not only did he speak in the power of
the Holy Spirit, but it was plain that he was a student of the proph-
ecies, and learned in all matters of the-law. He ably defended the
truths that he advocated, and utterly defeated his opponents."—"The
Acts of the Apostles," p. 97.
    12. What measures did they then take against him? Verses 11, 12.
    NOTE.—"As the priests and rulers saw the power that attended the
preaching of Stephen, they were filled with bitter hatred. Instead of
yielding to the evidence that he presented, they determined to silence
his voice by putting him to death. On several occasions, they had
bribed the Roman authorities to pass over without comment instances
where the Jews had taken the law into their own hands, and had
tried, condemned,, and executed prisoners in accordance with their
national custom. The enemies of Stephen did not doubt that they
could again pursue such a course without danger to themselves. They
determined to risk the consequences, and therefore seized Stephen, and
brought him before the Sanhedrin council for trial."—"The Acts of
the Apostles," p. 98.
    13. What charge was brought against Stephen? Verse 13.
    14. What did false witnesses testify they had heard him say?
Verse 14.
    15. How did Stephen appear to the members of ..the council?
Verse 15.
    16. What similarity is there in the accusation against Stephen and
the charge against Jesus? Matt. 26: 61.
                      PERSONAL APPLICATION
   What lesson may I learn from what was required of the persons
chosen to serve as deacons?

   Witnesses had been hired to swear that they had heard Stephen
speak blasphemous words against the temple and the law.
   "When Stephen was questioned as to the truth of the charges

questions under "Personal Application."
                                THE LESSON
   1. What was the formal charge brought against Stephen? Acts 6:
11, 13, 14.
    NOTE.—"Learned Jews from the surrounding countries were sum-
moned for the purpose of refuting the arguments of the prisoner.
Saul of Tarsus was present, and took a leading part against Stephen.
He brought the weight of eloquence and the logic of the rabbis to bear
upon the case, to convince the people that Stephen was preaching de-
lusive and dangerous doctrines; but in Stephen he met one who had
a full understanding of the purpose of God in the spreading of the
gospel to other nations."—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 98.
    2. In what ways did Stephen's trial resemble that of Jesus?—
Answer: Stephen's' trial was similar to that of Jesus in these particu-
lars:
    a. He was hated by priests and rulers.
    b. They were determined that he should die, thus making him an
example to intimidate other Christians.
                                     [27 1
      c. False witnesses were hired to testify against him.
      d. His last words were similar to those of Christ on the cross, as he
  prayed for forgiveness for his murderers.
      3. What question did OR high priest ask at the beginning of the
  trial? In reply, what line of history did Stephen rehearse? Why did
  he choose this method? What experiences of Abraham were first out-
' lined? Acts 7: 1-4.
      4. How much of the land promised to him did Abraham himself
  inherit? What experience did his descendants have in Egypt? What
  promise of deliverance was given them? Verses 5-8.
      5. What motive caused Jacob's sons to sell their brother Joseph?
  How did God overrule Joseph's experience to fulfill His promise?
  Verses 9, 10.
      6. What circumstances brought 'Joseph's 'brothers to Egypt? How
  did they become located there? Verses 11-15.
      NOTE.—It will be noticed that in each hikorical case presented by
  Stephen, the servant of God was first rejecte'd by his people, as was
  Jesus, yet God approved His own, and their adversaries were humili-
  ated. This was true of Moses, and the unexpressed, inference was that
  it would be the same in the case of Jesus, whom the Jews had put to
  death. The gist of Stephen's argument, however, was that a promise
  had been made to Abraham that had not yet been fulfilled (verse 5),
  and was therefore still to be fulfilled. This promise was to Abraham
  and to his seed. Abraham having died, the promise could be fulfilled
  only by a resurrection from the dead. The one thrOugh whom it was to
  be fulfilled was Christ, the Prophet promised in Deuteronomy 18:
  15, 18. His hearers saw the drift of the argument ,plainly enough,
 'but being determined not to be convinced, they stopped their ears, and
  condemned Stephen to death.
      7. What circumstances surrounded God's people as the time drew
  near for their deliverance from Egypt? Acts 7: 17-19.
      8. What deliverer was born at this time? What were some of his
  early experiences? VersOs 20-29.
      9. What call came to Moses after he had spent forty years in
  Midian? Verses 30-36.
      10. After thus rehearsing the history of Israel, what prophecy did.
  Stephen quote? Verse 37; Deut. 18: 15.
      11. What did Moses say would be the fate of the man -who did not
  receive that Prophet? Deut. 18: 18, 19.
      12. Who did Stephen say was with Moses in the wilderness? To
  whom did He speak? Acts 7: 38.
      13. How did the "fathers" treat the messenger from heaven? What
  demand did they make? In what way did God turn from them?
  Verses 39-43.
     14. What did Stephen say became of the taber:eacle? Afterward
  what did David and Solomon do? Verses 44-47.
      15. Did the tabernacle or the temple keep the pebple from idolatry?
1 Kings 11: 7, 8; 2 Kings 23: 12-14.
                                    [ 28
     16. How did the Jews regard the temple and the law? 1 Sam. 4:
3; Jer. 7: 4.
     17. What did Stephen say of the dwelling place of the Most High?
 What statement did he then make that brought the crisis in his trial?
 Acts 7: 48-53.
     NOTE.—"When Stephen had reached this point there was a tumult
 among the people. The prisoner read his fate in the countenances be-
 fore him. He perceived the, resistance that met his words, which were
 spoken at      dictation of the Holy Ghost. He knew that he was giving
 his last testimony. Few who read this address of Stephen properly
 appreciate it. The occasion, the time and place should be borne in
 mind to make his words convey their full significance. When he con-
 nected Jesus Christ with the prophecies, arid spoke of the temple as
 he did, the priest, affecting to be horror-stricken, rent his robe. This
 act was 'to Stephen a signal that his voice would soon be silenced for-
 ever. Although he was just in the midst of his sermon, he abruptly
 concluded it by suddenly breaking away from the chain of history, and,
 turning upon his infuriated judges,. said, 'Ye stiff-necked and un-
 circumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost; as
 your fathers did, so do ye.' ""The Spirit of Prophecy," vol, 3, pp.
297, 298.
     18. Did this statement concerning the temple justify the charge of
 Stephen's enemies, or was it the unfolding of the same, truth taught
 by Christ in John 4: 21, 24?
• 19. What did his enemies then do? Acts 7: 54.
     NOTE.—"At this, priests and rulers were beside themselves with
 anger. Acting more like beasts of prey than human beings, they
 rushed upon Stephen, gnashing their teeth. In the cruel faces about
 him, the prisoner read his fate; but he did not waver. For him the
 fear of death was gone. For him the enraged priests and the excited
 mob had no terror."—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 100.
     20. What view was given Stephen before his death? Verses 55, 56.
     NOTE.—"The scene about him faded from his vision; the gates of
 heaven were ajar, and Stephen, looking in, saw the glory of the courts
 of God, and Christ, as if just risen from His throne, standing ready to
 sustain His servant, who was about to suffer martyrdom for His name.
 When Stephen proclaffned the glorious scene opened before him, it was
 more than his persecutors could endure. They stopped their ears, that
 they might not hear his words, and uttering loud cries ran furiously
 upon him with one accord. . . . Amid the agonies of this most cruel
 death, the faithful martyr, like his divine Master, prayed for his
 murderers."—"The Spirit of Prophecy," vol. 3, pp. 298, 299.
     21. Who appears now for the first time in this experience? Verses
57, 58.
     NOTE.—"The witnesses who had accused Stephen were required to
 cast the first stones. These persons laid down their clothes at the feet
 of Saul, who had taken an active part in the disputation, and had con-
 sented to the prisoner's death."—"The Spirit of Prophecy," vol. 3, p.
299.'

                       SETTING OF THE LESSON
  . The persecution of the believers in Jerusalem became more bitter
after the death of Stephen. Many who had temporarily resided in that
city now returned to their distant homes: The means by which the
enemies of Christ sought to crush the gospel, were the means of scatter-
ing it, and "these holy fugitives were like so many lamps lighted by the
fire of the Holy Spirit, spreading everywhere the sacred flame by which
they themselves had been illuminated."

    7. Review the lesson by using questions. Discuss topics under "Personal
Application."
                                   THE LESSON
   1. Who took part in the martyrdom of Stephen by consenting to
his death? Acts 7: 58; 8: 1.
    2. What is said of the burial of Stephen? How did Saul manifest
his zeal as a persecutor? Acts 8: 2, 3.
   3. What did he afterward say as to his motives and experience at
that time? Acts 26: 9-11.
                                     [30 ]
    NOTE.—"At the scene of Stephen's trial and death, Saul had seemed
10. be imbued with a frenzied zeal. Afterward -he was angered by his
own secret conviction that Stephen had been Honored by God at the
very time when he was dishonored by men, Saul continued to perse-
cute the church of God, hunting them down, seizing them in their
houses, and delivering them up to the priests and rulers for imprison-
ment and death. His zeal in carrying forward this persecution brought
terror to the Christians at Jerusalem. The Roman authorities made no
special effort to stay the -cruel work, and, secretly aided the Jews, in
order to conciliate them, and to secure their favor.„.
    "After the death of Stephen, Saul was elected a member of the
Sanhedrin council, in consideration of the part he had acted on that
occasion. For a time he was a mighty instrument in the hands of
Satan to carry out hiS rebellion against the Son of God."—"The Acts
of the Apostles,” pp. 101, 102.
    4. What- good result followed the persecution of the church?
Where did the members go? What did they do? Who alone remained
in Jerusalem? Acts 8: 4, 1, last part; 11: 19-21.
    NOTE.—"The persecution that came upon the church in Jerusalem
resulted in giving a great impetus to the work of the gospel. Success
had attended the ministry of the Word in that place, and there was
danger that the disciples would linger there too long, unmindful of the
Saviour's commission to go to all the world. . . To scatter His repre-
sentatives abroad, where they could work for others, God permitted
persecution to come upon them."—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 105.
    5. To what place did Philip go? What did he preach to the people?
What success attended his efforts? How did the Holy Spirit confirm
Philip's preaching? How was the city affected? Acts 8: 5-8.
    NoTE.—"Philip, one of the seven deacons, was among thoge driven
from Jerusalem. . . And when His disciples were driven from Jeru-
salem, some found'ill. Samaria a safe asylum. The Samaritans web
comed these _messengers of the gospel, and the Jewish converts
gathered a precious harvest from among those who had once been their .
bitterest enemies.
    "Philip's, work in' Samaria was marked with great success, and thus
encouraged, he sent to Jerusalem for help. _The apostles now perceived
more fully the meaning Of the words of Christ, 'Ye shall be witnesses
unto Me both in Jerusalm, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto
the uttermost part of the earth.' "—"The Acts of the Apostles," pp: .
106,-1,07.
    6. What noted sorcerer 'did Philip meet? What had this man
done? Verse 9.
    7. How was this sorcerer regarded by the people? Verses 10, 11.
    8. How did Philip's preaching affect the followers of Simon? How
was Simon himself affected? Verses 12, 13.
   NOTE.—"In the traditions of the early centuries this Simon Magfis
occupies a large place as a reputed enemy of the church. So far as
the story of the Acts is concerned; he appears as a clever and un-
                                   31 ]
scrupulous magician, who by his arts and deceptions has played upon
the ignorance and credulity of his followers so that they might accept
his crude and mystical teachings, and more particularly might enrich
him by their gifts. He had so impressed the people of Samaria that
they regarded him as an incarnation of divine power.. . . The success
of Philip is evidenced, then, by the fact that all the people turned to
him from Simon, and that even 'Simon also himself believed; and
being baptized, he continued with Philip.' Of course, his belief was
quite imperfect; the sequel shows that he experienced neither true re-
pentance nor faith. His influence over the people, however, was de-
stroyed, and he was himself convinced that in the name of Jesus there
was a power he himself had never known. He is thus the symbol of
the false religious teachers, past and present, mystical, deceiving, self-
ish, who have oppoed the gospel, but have been overcome by its
power."—"The Acts," Charles R Erdman, p. 71.
   9. When the apostles at Jerusalem he\ard of Philip's success, whom
did they send to assist him? Verse-14.
   10. When these men arrived, what lack did they find in the expe-
rience of the believers? How was this lack supplied? Verses 15-17.
   11. What proposal did Simon make to the apostles? What object
did he have in making such a request? Verses 18, 19.
    12. *What name has been given to the sin of securing money, place,
or position in the church by bribes or by unscrupulous personal in-
fluence?
    NoTE.—"All traffic in things sacred has been called 'simony' from
the name of this ancient sorcerer; and all who are tempted to make
gain from holy Offices or spiritual gifts do well to ponder the solemn;
searching rebuke which fell from the lips of Peter. The words of
Peter, however, are not to be regarded as an imprecation or a curse.
They contain a call to repentance, but intimate thatthere is small hope
that Simon will or can change his evil course. tfis reply to Peter ex-
presseh fear but no real contrition; it indicates, however, how com-
pletely Simon, the popular leader, has been discredited and silenced."
—';The Acts," Charles R. Erdman, p. 73.
   13. What was Peter's reply to Simon's request? Verses 20-23.
   14. After this rebuke, what request did Simon make? Did he re-
pent of his sin, or did he seek only to be sheltered from its punishment?
Verse 24.
   15. What did the apostles do on their return to Jerusalem?
Verse 25.
    16. What change had taken place in John's feelings since his visit
to Samaria on another occasion? Luke 9: 52-54.
                    PERSONAL APPLICATION
   What am I doing to win souls for Jesus?
   What lessons may I learn from Philip's experience with Simon?

    1. While Philip was laboring at Samaria, ,what instruction was
 given him by the angel of the Lord? Acts 8: 26.
    NoTE.—"In this instance we have an illustration of the care of God
 for His children. He called/ Philip from his successful ministry in
`Samaria, to cross the desert and go to Gaza to labor for a single in-
 quiring soul. The promptness with which the eunuch accepted the
 gospel and acted upon its belief should be a lesson to us. God designs
 that we should be prompt in accepting and confessing Christ, prompt
 in obeying Him, and in answering the call of duty."—"The Spirit of
 Prophecy," vol. 3, p. 305.
    2. How did Philip obey this call? Whom did he meet on' his
journey? Verse 27.
    NOTE.—"Froin his great work in the city of Samaria Philip was
suddenly summoned to the desek hills of southern Judea. Instead of
addressing multitudes he.was to bring the gospel message to one man;
but the task is no less difficult and, to the mind of the Master, it is
no less important. . . . The man whom Philip found on the road which
led down from Jerusalem to Gaza was none other than the chancellor
of the exchequer of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians. He became a
                                  [33 ]
Christian missionary to the continent of Africa."—"The Acts,"

    3. What was the Ethiopian officer doing when Philip saw him?
Verse 28.
    4. Through what agency was Philip directed in this missionary
effort? Verse 26, first part; verse 29.

prising openings for testimony are certain to appear. These oppor-
tunities are fleeting. The Spirit said, `Go,' and 'Philip ran.' . . .

would have been gone forever. Work for Christ demands immediate
obedience to every prompting of His Spirit."—"The Acts," Charles
R. Erdman, p. 75.
   5. How does this experience show the goodness and love of God,
and His desire to save men?
    NOTE.—God brings 'the man who l?as light in touch with the man
who desires light.
   "An angel guided Philip to the one who was seeking for light, and
who was ready to receive the gospel; and to-day angels will guide the
footsteps of those workers who will allow the Holy Spirit to sanctify
their tongues and refine and ennoble their hearts. The angel sent to

    he appears in the story he is pictured as the' host who is entertaining
    missionaries and training his daughters to testify for Christ; at this
    time he is called 'the evangelist.' . . . One may be called to preach to
    thousands as was Philip in Samaria, or to speak to one man as in the
    desert of Judea; but he may be evangelizing the world quite as truly
    by the aid he gives to religious workers, and by exerting the abiding

                                  LESSON 12
                   THE CONVERSION OF SAUL
                              December 18, 1926

    MEMORY VERSE: "Lord, what wilt Thou have me to do?" Acts 9: 6.
    LESSON HELP: "The Acts of the Apostles," pp. 112-122.

                           SETTING OF THE LESSON
.       Saul had taken a prominent part in bringing about the death of
    Stephen. He was deeply impressed with the words and manner of
    Stephen, and began to fear that he was doing wrong in persecuting
    the followers of Jesus. "In his perplexity he appealed to those Yin
    whose wisdom and judgment he had full confidence. The arguments
    of the priests and rulers finally convinced him that Stephen was a
    blasphemer, that the Christ whom the martyred disciple had preached
    was an impostor, and that those ministering in holy office must be
    right.
        "Not without severe trial did Saul come to this conclusion. But in
    the end, his education and prejudices, his respect for his former
    teachers, and his pride of popularity, braced him to rebel against the
    voice of conscience and the grace of God. And having fully• decided
    that the priests and scribes were right, Saul became very bitter in his

                                  THE LESSON
    1. Under what circumstances do we first become acquainted with
Saul? Acts 7: 58; 8: 1, 3, 4.
    NOTE.—"Prominent among the Jewish leaders who became
thoroughly aroused by the success attending the proclamation of the
gospel, was Saul of Tarsus. A Roman citizen by birth Saul was                       •
nevertheless a Jew by descent, and had been educated in Jerusalem by
the most eminent of the rabbis. 'Of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of
Benjamin,' Saul was 'a Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law,
a Pharisee; concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the
righteousness which is in the law, blameless.' He was regarded by the
rabbis as a young man of great promise, and high hopes were cher-
ished•concerning him as an able and zealous defender of the ancient
faith. His elevation to membership in the Sanhedrin council placed
him in a position of power."—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 112.
    2. Whose assistance did Saul secure in persecuting God's people?
Acts 9: 1, 2.
     3. To what city did his zeal now lead him to go? How far did he
 travel from Jerusalem? Verse 3, first part.
     NOTE.—"Those who were driven from Jerusalem by this persecu-
 tion 'went everywhere preaching the word.' Among the cities to which
`they went was Damascus, where the new faith gained many converts."
 —"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 113.
     The distance to Damascus from Jerusalem was about 136 miles, and
 six days were required to make the journey.
     "Damascus is perhaps the oldest city in the world, and has now a
 population of 150,000. It has a fine situation in a plain at the foot of
 the Anti-Lebanon Mountains,- on the highway of traffic with the East.
 The street called Straight still runs through the city from east to
 west, but it is now called Sultany or Queen Street, and its former
 spacious width of a hundred feet has been narrowed to almost a lane.
 Tarsus, the boyhood home of Saul, is in Cilicia,'Asia Minor. It was
 an important Greek city, Zone of the great university towns of his
 time."—Adapted from Tarbell.
     4. What suddenly stopped Saul on his journey? Verse 3, last part.
     NomE.—"Filled with ,fear, and almost blinded by the intensity of
 the light, the companions of Saul heard a voice, but saw no man.
 But Saul understood the words that were spOien; and to him was
 clearly revealed the One who spoke—even the Son of pod. In the
 glorious Being who stood before him, he saw the Crucified One. Upon
                            •         [ 36 ]
the soul of the stricken Jew the image of the Saviour's countenance was
imprinted forever. The words spoken struck home to his heart with
appalling force. Into the darkened chambers of his mind there poured
a flood of light, revealing the ignorance and error of his former life,
and his present need of the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit."—"The
Acts of the Apostles," p. 115.
    5. What time of day was it when this great light shone upon him?
-How bright was it? Whence came this light which shone brighter than
the sun? Acts 26: 13.
   6. How did the brightness affect Saul and his companions? What
did Saul hear? Acts 9: 4; 26: 14.
    7. What question did Saul ask? What answer was given to him?
Acts 9: 5.
    NOTE.—"Now Christ had spoken to Saul with His own voice, say-
ing, 'Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou Mel' And the question, 'Who
art Thou, Lord?' was answered'by the same voice, am Jesus whom
thou persecutest.' Christ here identifies Himself with His people, In
persecuting the followers of Jesus, Saul had struck directly against the
Lord of heaven. In falsely accusing and testifying against them, he
had falsely accused and testified against the Saviour of the world."
—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 117.
    8. What is meant by the expression, "It is hard for thee to kick
against the pricks"?
                                                                . •
    NOTE.—"This is 'a Greek and Latin as well as Jewish proverb, de-
rived from the use of an oxgoad. The oxgoathis a-pole seven to ten
feet long, on one end of which is a broad, thin piece of iron used for
cleaning the plowshare, and on the other a pointed iron, or 'Prick' used
on the oxen instead of a whip. . . . An unruly ox that begins to kick
finds himself striking against the sharp prick. 'Paul had been lashing
out blindly, fiercely, like a restive ox, who fails to realize that the
path he is to travel in is laid out before him, and that the One who
controls him is both wiser and stronger than he. He feels the sharp
prick of the steel-pointed goad,-'and at first only kicks the harder; till
mere brute strength can bear the pain no longer, and the stronger,
wiser will prevails.'"—Tarbell.
  9. What was the first thought that seemed to come to Saul's mind?
What definite reply did Jesus make to his question? Verse 6.
  10. How were the men with Saul affected by what had taken place?
What was Saul's further experience? Verses 7, 8.
•    NoTE.—"How unlike his anticipations was his entrance into the
 city! Stricken with blindness, helpless, tortured by remorse, knowing
 not what further judgment might be in store for him, he sought out
 the home of the disciple Judas, where, in solitude, he had ample op-
 portunity for reflection and prayer."—"The Acts of- the Apostles,"
 p. 118.
    11. How earnestly did Saul seek the Lord? Verse 9.
                                  [ 37 ]
    NOTE.—"For three days Saul was 'without sight, and neither did
eat nor drink.' These days of soul agony were to him as years. Again '
and again he recalled, with anguish of spirit,'the part he had taken in
the martyrdom of Stephen. With horror he thought of his guilt in al-
lowing himself to be controlled by the malice and prejudice of the
priests and rulers, even when the face of Stephen had been lighted up
with the radiance of heaven. In sadness and brokenness of spirit he re-
counted the many times he had closed his eyes and ears against the
most striking evidences, and had relentlessly urged on the persecution
of the believers in Jesus of Nazareth. • These days of close self-
examination and of heart humiliation were spent in lonely seclusion."
—"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 118.
   12. What provision did the Lord make to enlighten Saul? Verses
10-12.
   NOTE.—"In the record of the conversion of Saul, importanePrinci-
pies are given us, which we should ever bear in mind. Saul was
brought directly into the presence of Christ. He was one whom Christ
intended for a most important work, one who was to be a 'chosen
vessel' unto Him; yet the Lord did not at once tell him of the work
that had been assigned him. He arrested him in his course and con-
victed him of sin; but when Saul asked, 'What wilt Thou have me to
do?' the Saviour placed the inquiring Jew in connection with His
church, there to obtain a knowledge of God's will concerning him."—
"The Acts of the Apostles," p. 120.
  13. What objection did Ananias make to the Lord's plan? Of what
was he fearful? Verses 13, 14.
    14. What did the Lord say He had chosen Saul to do? Verses
15, 16.
 _ 15. How did Ananias address Saul when he came to him? What
blessing did,he say he had come to bring? Verse 17.
   16. What immediate change took place in Saul's condition? What
advanced step in experience did he take? How was this advanced step
suggested to him? Verse 18; Acts 22: 16.
   17. What steps did he take to prepare for'his work? Acts 9: 19, 20.
    18. How did he progress in his experience? Verses 21, 22; Gal.
1: 15-17.
    NoTE.—"The opposition grew so fierce that Paul was not allowed to
continue his labors at Damascus. A messenger from heaven bade him
leave for a time; and he 'went into Arabia,' where he found a safe
retreat.
    "Here, in the solitude of the desert, Paul had ample opportunity
for quiet study and meditation. He calmly reviewed his past experience
and made sure work of repentance. He sought God with all his heart,
resting not until he knew for a certainty that his repentance was ac-
cepted and his sin pardoned., He longed for the assurance that Jesus
would be with him in his coming ministry. He emptied his soul of the
prejudices and traditions that had hitherto shaped his life, and re-
                                   38 ]
ceived instruction from the Source of truth. Jesus communed with
him, and established him in the faith, bestowing upon him a rich
measure of wisdom and grace."—"The Acts of the Apostles," pp. 125,
126.
                        PERSONAL APPLICATION
   Have I had the thorough conversion that Saul experienced?
   Do I daily inquire, "Lord, what wilt Thou have me to do?"
   When I know my duty, am I willing, like Saul, to do it?
