                          SETTING OF THE LESSON
   In the temple, in this last public teaching which Jesus. did, He
spoke the truth in parables to the chief priests and the rulers: The
scene is vividly described thus:
   "The contrast between Jesus and the high priest as- they talked
together was marked. The proud dignitary of the temple was clothed
in- rich and costly garments. Upon his head was a - glittering tiara.
His bearing was majestic, his hair and his long flowing beard. were
silvered by age., His appearance awed the beholders. Before / this
august personage stood the Majesty of heaven, without adornment
or display.• His garments were travel-stained; His face was pate:
and expressed a patient sadness; yet written there were dignity and
benevolence that contrasted strangely with the prolid, self-confident.
and angry air of the high priest. Many of those who witnessed the
words ,and deeds of Jesus in the temple, from that time enshrined
Him in their hearts as a prOphet of God. But as the popular feeling
turned in His favor, the hatred of the priests toward Jesus in-
creased."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 594.

16. Why did they not lay hands on Him? Verse 46.
                                    NOTES
    1. The householder is represented as planting the vineyard and
supplying all the conditions essential in producing fruit. In Isaiah
5: I, the vineyard of the Lord is represented as planted "in a very
fruitful, hill."
   - "The parable of the vineyard applies not alone to the Jewish
nation. It has a lesson for us. The -church in this generation has
been endowed by God with great yrivileges and blessings, and He
expects corresponding returns.
      We have been redeemed by a costly ransom. Only by the great-
ness of this ransom can we conceive of its results. On this earth,
the earth whose soil has been moistened by the tears and blood of
                                [4 1
the Son of God, are to be brought forth the precious fruits of Para-
dise. In the lives of God's people, the truths of His word are to
reveal their glory and excellence. Through His people Christ is
to manifest His character and the principles of His kingdom."—
"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 300.
    2. This final act of violence on the part of the husbandmen warns
of the terrible results of starting upon a course of evil. Probably
when they maltreated the first servants, they did not purpose to go
so far in wickedness. Their greed extended only to seizing the crop
of the season. This greed indulged, the way soon opened for greater
evil—they would seize upon the vineyard itself and make it their own
possession. Crime against the servants hardened them for the greater
crime of killing the son. Sin of any kind grows rapidly when al-
lowed to come into the life in any degree.
    3. In His desire for fruit from His vineyard, the Lord will not
ultimately be disappointed. If His offers of grace are rejected by
one, they will be made to another. The vineyard misused by the first
husbandmen passes into the hands of others, who 'will deal justly
with their Lord.
    Christ's sorrowful words, "Behold, your house is left unto you
desolate," express in a short form the fearful doom which the scribes
and Pharisees were facing. They were about to be separated from
God. Awful destruction was just before them. The vineyard was
about to be intrusted to other husbandmen. Hitherto those to whom
the parable was addressed had been the trusted and responsible
leaders of God's people, the shepherds of His flock, the keepers of
His vineyard, the officers of His church. But all this was to be taken
from them; His people, His church, was to be taken from those
husbandmen, the Jewish rulers and spiritual leaders, and to be given
to other husbandmen. What a warning there is in this experience,
 for the church of Christ to-day! The Lord will surely require as
 much of this people, favored above all others with gospel light and
privileges, as He did of His chosen people of old.
     "The hearers recognized the warning. But notwithstanding the
sentence they themselves had pronounced, the priests and rulers were
 ready to fill out the picture by,saying, 'This is the heir; come, let us
 kill him.' "—"The Desire of Ages," p. 597.
     4. "In quoting the prophecy of the rejected stone, Christ referred
 to an actual occurrence in the history of Israel. The incident was
 connected with the building of the first temple. While it had a
 special application at the time of Christ's first advent, and should
 have appealed with special force to the Jews, it has also a lesson for
 us. When the temple of Solomon was erected, the immense stones
 for the walls and the foundation were entirely prepared at the
 quarry; after they were brought to the place of building, not an
 instrument was to be used upon them; the workmen had only to
 place them in position. For use in the foundation, one stone -of
 unusual size and peculiar shape had been brought; but the workififf
 could find no place for it, and would not accept it. It was an annoy-
 ance to them as it lay unused in their way. Long it remained a
  rejected stone. But when the builders came to the laying of the
                                   [51
corner, they searched for a long time to find a stone of sufficient
size and strength, and of the proper shape, to take that particular
place, and bear the great weight which would rest upon it. Should
they make an unwise choice for this important place, the safety of '
the entire building would be endangered. They must find a stone
capable of resisting the influence of the sun, of frost, and of tempest.
Several stones had at different times been chosen, but under the ,
pressure of immense weights they had crumbled to pieces. Others
could not bear the test of the sudden atmospheric changes. But at
last, attention was called to the stone so long rejected. It had been
exposed to the air, to sun and storm, without revealing the slightest
crack. The builders examined this stone. It had borne every test
but one. If it could bear the test of severe pressure, they decided
to accept it for the corner stone. The trial was made. The stone
was accepted, brought to its assigned position, and found to be an
exact fit.          pp. 597, 598.
   5. "In the parable the householder represented God, the vineyard
the Jewish nation, and the hedge the divine law which was their
protection. The tower was a symbol of the temple. . , . As the hus-
bandmen had killed the servants whom the master sent to them for
fruit, so the Jews had put to death the prophets whom God sent to
call them to repentance. Messenger after messenger had been
slain. . . . In the beloved son whom the lord of the vineyard finally
sent to his disobedient servants, and whom they seized and slew,
the priests and rulers saw a distinct picture of Jesus and His impend-
ing fate. Already they were planning to slay Him whom the Father
had sent to them as a last appeal. In the retribution inflicted upon
the ungrateful husbandmen was portrayed the doom of those who
should put Christ to death."—Id., pp. 596, 597.

                                  NOTES
     1. "The call to the feast had been given by Christ's disciples. Our
 Lord had sent out the twelve and afterward the seventy, proclaiming
 that the kingdom of God was at hand, and calling upon men to repent
 and believe the gospel. But the call was not heeded. Those who
 were bidden to the feast did not come."—"Christ's Object Lessons,"
 P. 314. 3 a le>
     2.) Referring to the second call, and commenting upon verse 4 in
 the lesson, we have this statement: "This was the message borne to
 the Jewish nation after the crucifixion of Christ; but the nation that
 claimed to be God's peculiar people rejected the gospel brought to
 them in the power of the Holy Spirit. Many did this in the most
 scornful manner. Others were so exasperated by the offer of salva-
 tion, the offer of pardon for rejecting the Lord of .glory, that they
 turned upon the bearers of the message. There was 'a great perse-
 cution."—Id., pp. 314, 315.
     3. This seems to foreshadow the terrible retribution which came
 upon Jerusalem and the Jewish people in A. D. 70. The lesson, how-
 ever, is for all time.
     4. "The third call to the feast represents the giving of the gospel
 to the gentiles."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 315.
     5. In this reply, Jesus drew a clear distinction between the sphere
 of the church and the sphere of the state, and established as a Chris-
tian principle an absolute separation of the one from the other. He
 was not laying down any new principle, but was putting into the
 form of a direct statement the lesson which had already been taught
 in a concrete way in the experience of the three worthies under
 Nebuchadnezzar's rule in Babylon. During all the centuries since this
statement was made, there was a more or less close union of the
church with the state, until the eighteenth century, when, for the
first time, notably in the American nation, the principle enunciated
by Christ was adopted. For many years, however, an organized
effort has been made to reverse this new order of things, and to use
the power of the state to enforce the observance of religious dogmas.
This has all been foretold in prophecy, and the message against the
beast and his image (Rev. 54:9, 5o) involves an intelligent opposi-
tion to every effort to establish those false principles which found
their highest expression in the Middle Ages, when the church and the
state were but different aspects of the same power, and the pope and
the emperor were bound together in the closest union.
    6. "The spies had expected Jesus to answer their question directly,
in one way or the other. If He should say, It is unlawful to give
tribute to Cxsar, He would be reported to the Roman authorities and
arrested for inciting rebellion. But in case He should pronounce it
lawful to pay the tribute, they designed to accuse Him to the people
as opposing the law of God. Now they felt themselves baffled and
defeated. Their plans were disarranged. The summary manner in
which their question had been settled left them nothing further to
say."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 6oz.

                     SETTING OF THE LESSON
    The Pharisees and the Sadducees had asked Jesus many questions,
hoping to lead Him into saying something that would cause the people
to lose confidence in Him, or which could be made to appear as a
statement of disloyalty to the government, so that the Romans would
arrest Him. "Not a word had been spoken of which the least ad-
vantage could he taken for His condemnation. His adversaries had
gained nothing but the contempt of the people. The Pharisees, how-
ever, did not yet despair of driving Him to speak that which they
could use against Him. Tliey prevailed upon a certain learned scribe
to question Jesus as to which of the ten precepts of the law was of
the greatest importance."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 6o6.

     Note 7.
                                NOTES
    1. The Pharisees, Sadducees, and Herodians were joining hands
in the effort to entangle Jesus by asking shrewd questions. The
Pharisees stood in no friendly relation either to the Sadducees or to
the Herodians, but the Pharisees could make common cause with
them in seeking to entrap Jesus. His plain, pointed teaching had
often rebuked both sects; and they sought to break His influence
as a teacher, and to disprove His claim to being the Messiah, by
entangling Him in His talk—by leading Him to say something upon
which they could seize to condemn Him as. an impostor. Disputes,
too, between these sects were sometimes carried to Jesus, to secure
His influence on one side or the other. But no one ever came for
any purpose without receiving instiluction, which, if heeded, would
have worked salvation for himself.
    2. "The heart of Jesus went out in pity to the honest scribe who
had dared to face the frowns of the priests and the threats of the
rulers to speak the convictions of his heart. 'And when Jesus saw
that he answered discreetly, He said unto him, Thou art not far
from the kingdom of God.'
    "The scribe was near to the kingdom of God, in that he recog-
nized deeds of righteousness as more acceptable to God than burnt
offerings and sacrifices. But he needed to recognize the divine char-
acter of Christ."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 6o8.
    3. "The Pharisees had gathered close about Jesils as He answered
the question of the scribe. Now turning, He put a question to them :
`What think ye of Christ? whose son is He?' This question was
designed, to test their belief concerning the Messiah,—to show
whether they regarded Him simply as a man or as the Son of God."
—Ibid.

    4. "The same rebuke falls upon many in our day who make a
high profession of piety. Their lives are stained by selfishness and
avarice, yet they throw over it all a garment of seeming purity, and
thus for a time deceive their fellow men. But they can not deceive
God. He reads every purpose of the heart, and will judge every
man according to his deeds."--/d., p. 614.
    5. Jesus saw the gifts cast into the treasury and understood their
value. He beheld the "much" cast in by the "many" who were "rich."
He saw also the little cast in by the poor. He saw infinitely more
than all this. He accurately balanced the gift with the circumstances
of the giver. The value in His sight was not altogether measured
by the amount cast in. Jesus looked into the hearts of the givers,
and beheld the motives prompting the gifts. This "how" the givers
gave, above all else made the offering either of little value or precious
in the eyes of the Master. The many rich cast in a little of their
surplus. The destitute widow put in "out of her deficiency; all as
much as she had, . . . the whole of her living."—Rotherham.
    6. "The word translated 'mite' denotes a small coin made of
brass—the smallest in use among the Jews. ... It was in value about
three mills and a half, or one third of a cent [two thirds of an Eng-
lish farthing]."—Barnes.
    7. "Jesus was in the court where were the treasure chests, and
He watched those who came to deposit their gifts. Many of the rich
brought large sums, which they presented with great ostentation.
Jesus looked upon them sadly, but made no comment on their liberal
offerings. Presently His countenance lighted as He saw a poor
widow approach hesitatingly, as though fearful of being observed.
As the rich and haughty swept by, to deposit their offerings, she
shrank back as if hardly daring to venture farther. And yet she
longed to do something, little though it might be, for the cause
she loved. She looked at the gift in her hand. It was very small
in comparison with the gifts of those around her, yet it was her all.
Watching her opportunity, she hurriedly threw in her two mites, and
turned to hasten away. But in doing this she caught the eye of
Jesus, which was fastened earnestly upon her.
    "The Saviour called His disciples to Him, and bade them mark
the widow's poverty. Then His words of commendation fell upon
 her ear: 'Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor .widow hath cast
 in more than they all.' Tears of joy filled her eyes as she felt that
 her act was understood and appreciated. . . . Jesus understood her
 motive."—"The Desire of Ages," pp. 614, 615.

PERSONS: Jesus and His disciples.
                       SETTING OF THE LESSON
   Jesus had spent the day in the temple, answering the questions
with which the Pharisees were trying to entangle Him, and speaking
parables of warning. Though He had wrought so many miracles
before them, and though His words convicted them, the Pharisees
turned from Him, hardening their hearts and refusing to believe.
Jesus then said to the Jews, "Behold, your house is left unto you
desolate." Slowly and with deepest regret He left the precincts of
the temple, never to return.
   Jesus' words and manner struck terror to the hearts of the priests
and rulers, even though they seemed indifferent. The disciples, too,
were fearful, and anxiously waited for some further explanation.

                                NOTES
    1. "Christ's words to the priests and rulers, 'Behold, your house
is left unto you desolate,' had struck terror to their hearts. They
affected indifference, but the question kept rising in their minds as to
the import of these words. An unseen danger seemed to threaten
them. Could it be that the magnificent temple, which was the nation's
glory, was soon to be a heap of ruins? The foreboding of evil was
shared by the disciples, and they anxiously waited for some more '
definite statement from Jesus."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 627.
    2. It did not seem possible to the disciples that so magnificent a
structure as the temple could be destroyed. Therefore on going out
of the building, they called the attention of Jesus to the immense
stones, so closely fitted that the wall appeared almost like a solid
rock. What catastrophe could bring desolation to it? Then came
Jesus' amazing answer.
    When Jesus spoke these words concerning the destruction of the
temple, the Jewish nation was at peace. Yet in the short space of
forty years all His words came true. The Roman army, under the
command of Titus, in A. D. 70, laid siege to Jerusalem, and took
the city. A soldier thrust a lighted torch between the hinges of the
door of the temple, and in an instant the cedar-lined chambers were
ablaze. The soldiers continued their work of destruction until both
the city and the temple were "razed to their foundations, and the
ground upon which the holy house had stood was plowed like a field."
    3. In order to understand the teaching of Matthew 24, especially
to avoid confusing the sequence of events, we should keep the fol-
lowing considerations in mind:
    a. The disciples had not given up the idea that Jesus would de-
liver the Jews from the Roman yoke, and set up a temporal kingdom
of His own.
     b. The disciples were amazed when Jesus told them plainly that
 not one of the stones in the magnificent temple walls would be left
 upon another.
     c. Through parables and otherwise, Jesus had repeatedly woken
of His coming again. This coming had been represented in type at
                                 [ 13 ]
  the transfiguration, and in miniature at the triumphal entry into
  Jerusalem, when the disciples and the multitude thought He was in
  the very act of taking the kingdom. When Jesus left the temple
  the last time, He had declared to the people that they would not see
  Him again till they should say, "Blessed is He that cometh in the
  name of the Lord." Thus He called up anew the scene of His
  triumphal entry, which tended to revive the hope of the disciples
\ that they might see Him established in His kingship.
      cj! Seemingly with the idea in mind that these three events—the
  destruction of the temple, the coming of Jesus, and the end of the
  world—might occur at the same time, the disciples inquire of Jesus
  privately about "these things:"
          There are two particular points in their question—when shall
  these things take place, and what shall be the sign of their approach?
     ' In His answer, Jesus "mingled the description of these two
  events"—the destruction of Jerusalem and the second coming of
  Christ—giving the signs by which the approach could be discerned.
  Since events connected with the first advent of Christ, culminating
  in the destruction of Jerusalem and the deliverance of the Christians,
  resembled in many respects those preceding His second coming, many
  of the words of Christ in answer to the disciples' question have a
  double application: (I) to the events leading up to the destruction
  of Jerusalem; (2) to those leading up to the second coming of Christ.
          The historian Josephus says that there were many who, claim-
  ing divine inspiration, deceived the people, leading out numbers of
  them to the desert, pretending that God would, there show them the
  signs of liberty—meaning redeiription from the Roman power.
  (See "Wars," book 2, chapter 3.)
      "Christ's words were fulfilled. Between His death and the siege
 of Jerusalem, many false messiahs appeared."—"The Desire of
  Ages," p. 628.
      That this prophecy applies also to the last days is evident because
 it is virtually repeated in verses 23, 24. "The Desire of Ages" con-
 tinues : "But this warning was given also to those who live in this
 age of the world. The same- deceptions practiced prior to the de-
 struction of Jerusalem have been practiced through the ages, and
 will be practiced again."
      5. Verse 14 stands out prominently in Matthew 24. The verses
 preceding and those. following verse 14 picture distressing conditions
 that would obtain between the time of Christ and that of His second
 coming. There would‘be war, famine, pestilence, deception, perse-
 cution, great tribulation. But despite these forbidding conditions,
 the gospel of the kingdom was to "be preached in all the world for
 a witness unto all nations; and then" should the end come.' Following
 long centuries of darkness, the Reformation again set the light of
 the gospel ablaze. In more recent times, many agencies have co-
 operated in preparing the way for the message of the soon coming
 of Jesus. Bible societies have distributed millions of copies of the
 word of God in many lands. More than a century ago missionaries
 began opening the doors of heathen countries.
                                    14
    Then a little time before 1844, the attention of the world waa
turned to the prophecies of His coming kingdom. Following th<
disappointment of 1844, a handful of believers rallied to the task of
sending to the remotest parts of the earth the message of the coming
of Jesus. This message has advanced from a small beginning until
in the face of opposition, it has been carried into countries far ark
near. There is hardly a part of the world where the messengers of
this movement have not gone. -More than 15,00o workers \ are in
unison telling the story in about two hundred languages. Possibly
the most important and most definite sign of the end is the fulfill-
ment of Matthew 24: 14.

                       SETTING OF THE LESSON
   Jesus continues His talk to the disciples in answer to their ques-
tion concerning the destruction of the temple and the end of the
world.
   "Jesus did not answer His disciples by taking up separately the
destruction of Jerusalem and the great day of His coming. He
mingled the description of these two events. Had He opened to His
disciples future events as He beheld them, they would have been
unable to endure the sight. In mercy to them He blended the de-
scription of the two great crises, leaving the disciples to study out
the meaning for themselves. 'When He referred to the destruction
of Jerusalem, His prophetic words reached beyond that event to the
final conflagration in that day when the Lord shall rise out of His
place to punish the world for their iniquity, when the earth shall
disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain. This entire
discourse was given, not for the disciples only, but for those who
should live • in the last scenes of this earth's history."—"The Desire
of Ages," p. 628.
    The lesson begins with a reference to the destruction of Jeru-
salem, and to Daniel's prophecy concerning that event.

                                     NOTES
    1. The 2300 prophetic days, or literal years, began with the com-
 mand to restore and build Jerusalem, in the autumn of 457 a. c.
 Seventy weeks, or 490 full years,. from that time, reaches to the
 autumn of 34 A. D., when Stephen was stoned to death, the church
 at Jerusalem was scattered by persecution, and the apostles "went
.everywhere preaching the Word, to gentiles as well as to Jews.
    2. Christ caused "the sacrifice and the oblation to cease" by His
 death upon the cross, when the veil of the temple was rent in twain,
 and the typical service of the sanctuary came to an end. Of what
                                  16
Jesus formerly had called "My Father's house," He had said, "Be-
hold, your house is left unto you desolate." Matt. 23: 38. "Desolate'
means unoccupied, empty after being occupied. God no longer mani-
 fested His presence there.
     3. At the siege of Jerusalem, a pagan power, the Roman, set up
its own gods in the holy place,—fitting sequel to the rejection of the
 Messiah by those who once were God's "peculiar people"! This is
what Jesus refers to as "the abomination of desolation," a type of
the greater abominations to follow in the Dark Ages.
     4. The "days" of "great tribulation" Jesus here speaks of can be
no other than the long period of 126o years of papal persecution
through which the church was to pass, when millions of the saints
of God were cruelly put to death as heretics. Dan. 7: 25; Rev. 12: 6,
13, 14. These days of papal supremacy began in 538 A. D., and ended
in 1798. But Jesus said the time of persecution should be "short-
ened." As a result of the Reformation under Luther and his asso-
ciates, Jesus' words met their literal fulfillment in that the days of
persecution ended about the middle of the eighteenth centur
fat-y-years-trefure-the- close . of-t14. period-in-17A-
     5. "As one of the signs of Jerusalem's destruction, Christ had
said, 'Many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.' False
prophets did rise, deceiving the people, and leading great numbers
into the desert. Magicians and sorcerers, claiming miraculous
power, drew the people after them into the mountain solitudes. But
this prophecy was spoken also for the last days. This sign is given
as a sign of the second advent. Even now false christs and false
prophets are showing signs and wonders to seduce His disciples. Do
we not hear the cry, 'Behold, He is in the desert'? Have not thou-
sands gone forth into the desert, hoping to find Christ? And from
thousands of gatherings where men profess to hold communion with
departed spirits, is not the call now heard, 'Behold, He is in the
secret chambers'? This is the very claim that Spiritualism puts forth.
But what says Christ?—`Believe it not. For as the lightning cometh
out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the
coming of the Son of man be.' "—"The Desire of Ages," p. 631.
     6. The second coming of Jesus can not be counterfeited. It will
be impossible for Satan to imitate the manner of His coming as
outlined in these words of Scripture. Jesus has forewarned His
people, so that none need be deceived by false teaching concerning
the coming of Christ.
     7. "In these words our Saviour announces a vital principle of
eternal justice. The destruction to come first upon Jerusalem and
the men of that generation, and later upon the last generation, would
not come because of an arbitrary decree of an offended God, but as
the inevitable result of the deliberate choice of the people. Taking
note of the calamities foretold by our Lord, but failing to discern
the principle involved, the disciples asked, 'Where, Lord?' And Jesus
answered, 'Wheresoever the body is, thither will the eagles be gath-
ered together.' Luke 17: 37. In other words, wherever the cup of
iniquity of an individual, a city, a nation, or a generation has been
 filled up, there will fall the condemnation and judgments."—"Her-
 aids of the King," pp. 72, 73.
                                [ 17
    8. The signs given in verse 29 have had their fulfillment as
follows :
    May 19, 178o, is known in history as "the dark day." The follow-
ing night, although the moon was almost at its full, was so dark that
a sheet of white paper held close to the eyes was equally invisible
with the blackest velvet.
    November 13, 1833, is noted for the remarkable display of falling
stars, which has been described as "the greatest display of celestial
fireworks" ever seen.
    9. Just what "the sign of the Son of man" will be is not directly
stated in the text, but rather implied. However, we have this de-
scription by the servant of God of the coming of Jesus : "Soon
appeared the great white cloud, upon which sat the Son of man.
When it first appeared in the distance, this cloud looked very small.
The angel said that it was the sign of the Son of man. As it drew
nearer the earth, we could behold the excellent glory and majesty
of Jesus as He rode forth to conquer. A retinue of holy angels,
with bright, glittering crowns upon their heads, escorted Him on His
way. No language can describe the glory of the scene."—"Early
Writings," p. 286.

ing words of our Lord from the Mount of Olives: 'Take heed to
yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeit-
ing, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come
upon you unawares.' Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye
may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come
to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.'"—"The Desire of

    1."The sins that called for vengeance upon the antedib-vian
 world, exist to-day. The fear of God is banished from the hearts
                                     [ 19
of men, and His law is treated with indifference and. contempt. The
intense worldliness of that generation is equaled by that of the gen-
eration now living. . . . God did not condemn the antediluvians for
eating and drinking; He had given them the fruits of the earth in
great abundance to supply their physical wants. Their sin consisted
in taking these gifts without gratitude to the Giver, and debasing
themselves by indulging appetite without restraint. It was lawful
for them to marry. Marriage was in God's order ; it was one of
the first institutions which He established. He gave special directions
concerning this ordinance, clothing it with sanctity and beauty; but
these directions were forgotten, and marriage was perverted, and
made to minister to passion. A similar condition of things exists
now. That which is lawful in itself is carried to excess."—"Patri-
archs and Prophets," p.
    2. In studying verses 32-51 of this chapter, it is well to keep in
mind that some of the many texts of the Bible referring to the sec-
ond coming of Christ refer to specific incidents in that group of ex-
periences, others to the broader event as a whole. There are only two
advents of Christ particularly named and numbered in the Bible,—
the first advent and the second advent. Taken in their larger aspect,
each of these events covers all the incidents of its respective period.
   3. "Jesus has left us word, 'Watch ye therefore: for ye know not
when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at
the cock-crowing, or in the morning; lest coming suddenly he find
you sleeping. And what I say unto you, I say unto all, Watch.' We
are waiting and watching for the return of the Master, who is
to bring the morning, lest coming suddenly He find us sleeping.
What time is here referred to? Not to the revelation of Christ in
the clouds of heaven to find a people asleep. No; but to His return
from His ministration in the most holy place of the heavenly sanc-
tuary, when He lays off His priestly attire, and clothes Himself with
garments of vengeance, and when the mandate goes forth, 'He that
is unjust, let him be unjust still: . . . and he that is holy, let him
be holy still.' "—"Testimonies," vol. 2, pp. 19o, 191.
   4. No one knows the day and hour when Jesus is to lay down
His censer in the most holy place in the heavenly sanctuary. That
most important day of all days to the children of men, the Father
keeps in His own power. (See Acts i:6, 7.) On that day, the
destiny of every soul is fixed for either weal or woe, life or death,
beyond the possibility of recall. A most solemn hour !
   "When Jesus ceases to plead for man, the cases of all are forever
decided. . . . This time finally comes suddenly upon all, and those
who have neglected to purify their souls by obeying the truth, are
found ,sleeping. They became weary of waiting and watching; they
became indifferent in regard to the coming of their Master."—
"Testimonies," vol. 2, p. 191.
   5. "They [the evil servants] longed not for His appearing, and
thought there was no need of such continued, persevering watching.
They had been disappointed in their expectations, and might be again.
They concluded that there was time enough yet to arouse. They
would be sure not to lose the opportunity of securing an earthly
                                20
treasure. It would be safe to get all of this world they could. And
in securing this object, they lost all anxiety and interest in the
appearing of the Master. They became indifferent and careless, as
though His coming were yet in the distance. But while their interest
was buried up in their worldly gains, the work closed in the heavenly
sanctuary, and they were unprepared."—Ibid.
    6. "If such had only known that the work of Christ in the heav-
enly sanctuary would close so soon, how differently would they have
conducted themselves! how earnestly would they have'watched! The
Master, anticipating all this, gives them timely warning in the com-
mand to watch: He distinctly states the suddenness of His coming.
He does not measure the time, lest we shall neglect a momentary
preparation, and in our indolence look ahead to the time when we
think He will come, and defer the preparation. 'Watch ye there-
fore : for ye know not.' . . . Those not found waiting and watching,
are finally surprised in their unfaithfulness. The Master comes, and
instead of their being ready to open unto Him immediately, they are
locked in worldly slumber, and are lost at last."—Id., pp. 191, 192.
    7. "The world, full of rioting, full of godless pleasure, is asleep,
asleep in carnal security. Men are putting afar off the coming of
the Lord. They laugh at warnings. The proud boast is made, 'All
things continue as they were from the beginning.' To-morrow shall
be as this day, and much more abundant.' We will go deeper into
pleasure loving. . . .
    "Everything in the world is in agitation. The signs of the times
are ominous. Coming events cast their shadows before. The Spirit
of God is withdrawing from the earth, and calamity follows calamity
by sea and by land. There are tempests, earthquakes, fires, floods,
murders of every grade. Who can read the future? Where is
security? There is assurance in nothing that is human or earthly....
    "The crisis is stealing gradually upon us. The sun shines in the
heavens, passing over its-usual round, and the heavens still declare
the glory of God. Men are still eating and drinking, planting and
building, marrying, and giving in marriage. Merchants are still
buying and selling. Men are jostling one against another, contend-
ing for the highest place. Pleasure lovers are still crowding to
theaters, horse races, gambling hells. The highest excitement pre-
vails, yet probation's hour is fast closing, and every case is about
to be eternally decided. Satan sees that his time is short. He has
set all his agencies at work that men may be deceived, deluded, occu-
pied, and entranced, until the day of probation shall be ended, and
the door of mercy be forever shut."—"The Desire of Ages," pp.
635, 636.
   "Take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be over-
charged with surfeiting, and drunkenness,.and cares of this life, and
so that day come upon you unawares. For as a snare shall it come
on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth. Watch ye
therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to
escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before
the Son of man." Luke 21: 34-36.

   "Christ with His disciples is seated upon the Mount of Olives.
The sun has set behind the mountains, and the heavens are curtained
with the shades of evening. In full view is a dwelling house, lighted
up brilliantly, as if for some festive scene. The light streams from
the openings, and an expectant company wait around, indicating that
a marriage procession is soon to appear. . . . As Christ sat looking
upon the party that waited for the bridegroom, He told His disciples
the story of the ten virgins, by their experience illustrating the ex-
perience of the church that shall live just before His second coming."

                                NOTES
    1. "Then" refers to the time described in the latter part of the
preceding chapter. There is a very evident relation between this
parable and the theme of the preceding chapter, which deals with
the coming of the Lord. T o notes sound forth clearly throughout
the parable and its applica 'on: Watch, and be ready. Watching—
that is, keeping wide-awa e—is the main essential t being ready.
This represents a class f people who are looking f r the coming
Bridegroom, and waitin to go out to imeet Him.
     2. Mark the difference, in the parable, between the preparation
of the foolish virgins and that of the wise ones, for on this difference
turns the meaning of the whole parable: the foolish "took no oil ;"
the wise "took oil." All had lamps, and the lamps were all filled with
oil to start With; but only half of the virgins provided against delay
in the coming of the bridegroom.
     3. "On the occasion of a marriage the bridegroom, attended by
his friends, went to the house of his bride, and brought her with her
friends in joyful procession to his own house. The virgins mentioned
in the text were probably some of the friends of the bride, who were
to meet and join the procession at some convenient place. . . .
     "Whether these virgins carried torches, or merely lamps, as, some
commentators suppose, they needed a supply of oil to replenish their
light, and hence were obliged to carry 'vessels' to contain the supplies
of oil. Great efforts are made to have an abundance of light at
Oriental weddings. . . . Reference is made to this custom of night
 weddings, not only in these two verses, but also in the first verse,
and in the fifth and sixth verses. Lamps, torches, and lanterns are
 freely used in the marriage procession, and also at the house of the
bridegroom, where the ceremony is performed. . . .
     "At all formal banquets the invited guests presented their tablets
 or cards to a servant stationed at the entrance door for the purpose,
 care being taken to keep out uninvited spectators. When the com-
 pany were assembled the 'master of the house' shut the door, and
 after that the servant was not allowed to admit anyone, no matter
                                  I 23 1
how great the importunity. This illustrates not only the text, but
also Luke 13: 24, 25."—"Bible Manners and Customs," pp. 378, 379.-
    4. "In the parable, all the ten virgins went out to meet the bride-
groom. All had lamps, and vessels for oil. For a time there was
seen no difference between them. So with the church that lives just
before Christ's second coming. All have a knowledge of the Scrip-
tures. All have heard the message of Christ's near approach, and
confidently expect His appearing. But as in the parable, so it is now.
A time of waiting intervenes, faith is tried; and when the cry is
heard, `Behold, the Bridegroom cometh ; go ye out to meet Him,'
many are unready. They have no oil in their vessels with their lamps.
They are destitute of the Holy Spirit."—"Christ's Object Lessons,"
P. 459.
    5. "The class represented by the foolish virgins are not hypocrites.
They have a regard for the truth, they have advocated the truth, they
are attracted to those who believe the truth ; but they have not
yielded themselves to the Holy Spirit's working. . . .
    "This is the class that in time of peril are found crying, Peace and
safety. They lull their hearts into security, and dream not of danger.
When startled from their lethargy, they discern their destitution, and
entreat others to supply their lack; but in spiritual things no man
can make up another's deficiency."—Id., pp. 419, 420.
    6. At first thought, the answer of the wise may seem selfish.
But these virgins were to have an important part in making the
wedding a success. Their first duty was to discharge this responsi-
bility faithfully. It had to be an individual work. So with the
Christian ; he can not say to another, Give me of your supply of
grace; he is to go to "them that sell," to the Source of grace, and
buy for himself. "Though Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, as I
live, saith the Lord God, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter;
they shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness."
Eze. 14: 20.
    7. "Saddest of all words that ever fell on mortal ear are those
words of doom, `I know you not.' The fellowship of the Spirit,
which you have slighted, could alone make you one with the joyous
throng at the marriage feast. In that scene you can not participate.
Its light would fall on blinded eyes, its melody upon ,deaf ears. Its
love and joy could awake no chord of gladness in the world-
benumbed heart. You are shut out from heaven by your own unfit-
ness for its companionship."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 422.

    "Christ op the Mount of Olives had spoken to His disciples of
 His second advent to the world. He had specified certain signs that
 were to show when His coming was near, and had bidden His dis-
 ciples watch and be ready. Again He repeated the warning, 'Watch
 therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son
 of man cometh.' Then He showed what it means to watch for His
 coming. The time is to be spent, not in idle waiting, but in diligent
 working. This lesson He taught in the parable of the talents."—

     What statement did he add? Verse 3o.
                                NOTES
    1. The parable of the talents is an explanation of the waiting time
between Jesus' departure from this earth and His return. The
parable of the ten virgins emphasizes the need of continual prepara-
tion for the Master's return; this of the talents, the use of the time
during His absence. The words, "Occupy till I come" (Luke 19: 13),
show that this parable reaches, as does that of the ten virgins, to the
end of the world.
    2. The lord is represented here as giving his goods to each serv-
ant according to his ability. No more is required of any man than
the faithful, energetic use of his God-given ability, whatever it may
be. Ability, talents, grow by use. It is not the Lord's plan that we
merely preserve from waste the ability He gives us, if that were
possible; but He expects an increase.
    3. "The talents, however few, are to be put to use. The question
that most concerns us is not, How much have I received? but, What
am I doing with that which I have? The development of all our
powers is the first duty we owe to God and to our fellow men. No
one who is not growing daily in capability and usefulness is fulfilling
the purpose of life. In making a profession of faith in Christ we
pledge ourselves to become all that it is possible for us to be as
workers for the Master, and we should cultivate every faculty to
the highest degree of perfection, that we- may do the greatest amount
of good of which we are capable."-"Christ's Object Lessons," pp.
331, 332. .
                                    26
    4. "The word 'strew' means to scatter—as men scatter seed in
sowing it. It may mean also to ventilate, or to fan by ventilating or
winnowing. As sowing the seed is mentioned just before, it may be
that this refers to gathering grain fanned or winnowed by others,
while he did nothing—indicating also a hard or sordid disposition."
—Barnes.
    "Gathering where thou hast not strawed (scattered), 'with the
winnowing, fan—appropriating everything produced on his land by
the labor of his servants, without giving them any share—no induce-
ment to work for such a c irmudgeon master.' "—Expositor's Greek
Testament.
    Peloubet says, "This representation of the worst kind of landlord
is set forth in the parable in order to show by contrast that if it was
mean and unworthy to misuse the property of such a man, how
infinitely worse it was so to treat the gifts intrusted by One who is
holy and just."
    5. "It needs no comment to show that his [the one-talent serv-,
ant's] own words, however honest and self-righteous they might
sound, admitted dereliction of his work and duty as a servant, and
entire misunderstanding as well as heart alienation from his master.
He served him not, and he knew him not; he loved him not, and he
sympathized not with him. But, besides, his answer was also an
insult and a mendacious pretext. He had been idle and unwilling
to work for his master. If he worked, it would be for himself. He
would not incur the difficulties, the self-denial, perhaps the reproach,
connected with his master's work. We recognize here those. who,
although His servants, yet, from selfish indulgence and worldliness,
will not do work for Christ with the,one talent intrusted to them—
that is, even though the responsibility and claim upon them be the
 smallest."—"Life and Times of Jesus," Edersheim, vol. 2, p. 462.
    6. "The punishment for refusing to use the talent is the loss of
 the talent itself. (I, ) The opportunities will be taken away from him
 who neglects them; he will not see them, nor be able to use them.
 (2) The ability to use them is taken away. The unused limb grows
 weak ; the still water dries up or becomes foul; the inactive mind
loses its power. This loss of the talent begins in this life; is gradual,
 that men may take warning and have opportunity to repent ; but
 finally,atAte--tadginent..cln, the talent will be wholly and irrevocably
 taken away."—Peloubet.
     7. "Upon the slothful servant the sentence was, 'Take therefore
 the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents.'
 Here, as in 'the reward of the faithful worker, is indicated, not
 merely the reward at the final judgment, but the gradual process of
 retribution in this life. As in the natural, so in the spiritual world:
 every power unused will weaken and decay. Activity is the, law of
 life; idleness is death."—"Christ's Object Lessons," pp. 367, 368.

   "The knowledge of God is obtained from His word. The experi-
mental knowledge of true godliness, found in daily consecration and
service, insures the highest culture of body, mind, and soul."—

   "Christ on the Mount of Olives pictured to His disciples the scene
of the great judgment day. And He represented its decision as
turning upon one point. When the nations are gathered before Him,
there will be but two classes, and their eternal destiny will be deter-
mined by what they have done or have neglected to do for Him in
the person of the poor and the suffering. In that day Christ does not
present before men the great work He has done for them in giving
His life for their redemption. He presents the faithful work they

                                NOTES
    1. When Jesus comes the second time, the event is to be so glori-
ous that heaven will be emptied of all its inhabitants to form His
escort of honor. Our finite imagination can gain but a faint con-
ception of what the glory of that event will be. Jesus is to bring
"all the holy angels with Him." Revelation 5: II gives an impression
of an innumerable host: "The number of them was ten thousand
times ten thousand, and thousands of thousand' or as the original
gives it, "myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands." A
myriad in Greek is the definite number ten thousand, so that this
text really says, "ten thousands of ten thousands, and thousands of
thousands." Well may we conclude that "all the holy angels" who
will escort the coming King on His glorious return, will be, as the
translators of Hebrews put it, "innumerable hosts of angels." Heb.
I2: 22, R. V.
    2. The angels do not come with Jesus as an escort of honor alone.
In Matthew 24: 31, it is said that "they shall gather together His elect
from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other." A
gloriou's gathering that will be!
    3. "While Satan was rallying his army, the saints were in the
city, beholding the beauty and glory of the Paradise of God. Jesus
was at their head, leading them. All at once the lovely Saviour was
gone from our company; but soon we heard His lovely voice, saying,
`Come. ye blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for
you from the foundation of the world.' We gathered about Jesus,
and just as He closed the gates of the city, the curse was pronounced
upon the wicked. The gates were shut. Then the saints used their
wings and mounted to the top of the wall of the city. Jesus was also
with them; His crown looked brilliant and glorious. It was a crown
within a crown, seven in number. The crowns of the saints were
of the most pure gold, decked with stars. Their faces shone with
glory, for they were in the express image of Jesus; and as they
arose, and moved all together to the top of the city, I was enrap-
tured with the sight."—"Early Writings," pp. 53* 54.
    4. It is important to notice that the service on which the King
will base His commendation or condemnation, is service that is
within the reach of every one, even of the least. The words "these
 My brethren" may seem to indicate that this service is to be given
to Christ's followers only, but we should not interpret them nar-
                                 [ 29]
rowly. While there is a special bond of love between Christ and
His followers, and a special promise to any who give them, so much
as."a cup of cold water" (Matt. to: 42), yet Christ will recognize the
spirit of unselfish service that ministers to anyone in distress, even
when the service is performed by one who is not apparently a fol-
lower of Christ.
   "Even among the heathen are those who have cherished the spirit
of kindness; before the words of life had fallen upon their ears,
they have befriended the missionaries, even ministering to them at
the peril of their own lives. Among the heathen are those who wor-
ship God ignorantly, those to whom the light is never brought by
human instrumentality, yet they will not perish. Though ignorant
of the written law of God, they have heard His voice speaking to
them in nature, and have done the things that the law required.
Their works are evidence that the Holy Spirit has touched their
hearts, and they are recognized as the children of God."—"The
Desire of Ages," p. 638.
    5. The word "everlasting" in verses 41 and 46, and the word
"eternal" in verse 46, are the same word in the original. It must be
understood in each case as meaning everlasting in effect. The fire
will be everlasting in effect by consuming the wicked. As Malachi 4
says, it shall "burn them up," and "they shall be ashes under the soles
of your feet." Verses 1, 3. The punishment thus inflicted will be
everlasting in effect—there will be no recovery from this destruction.
Life can be everlasting in effect, only by never being cut off. Tn
short, there are only two results—everlasting death and everlasting
life. The means and process of producing death need not be con-
fused with the result—death.

                                     NOTES
   1. From this point, Jesus prepares to enter the final struggle with
the prince of darkness. His public ministry is ended. His heart
yearningly turns to His disciples. He is closeted, as it were, with
                                 31
them, and imparts all the instruction He sees they can bear. Much
that He longs to tell them is stayed upon His lips; for they are not
ready. His hour has now come, but they are unprepared for it.
   2. It will be observed that the Bible record lifts the veil and
reveals the principal events taking place within two circles—that of
Jesus and His little band, and that of the Jews under the leadership
of Satan, with whom they were closely allied in this conspiracy.
First we are shown the one, and then the other.
   3. "We look with horror upon the treachery of Judas ; but his
case represents a large class who file in under the banner of Christ,
yet are really His worst enemies. They worship only self and money,
and use the name of Christian as a cloak to hide their evil deeds.
They sell their integrity for money, and their Saviour for a little
worldly advantage."—"Spirit of Prophecy," vol. 3, pp. 82, 83.
   4. "The Passover was to be both commemorative and typical, not
only pointing back to the deliverance from Egypt, but forward to
the greater deliverance which Christ was to accomplish in freeing
His people from the bondage of sin. The sacrificial lamb represents
`the Lamb of God,' in whom is our only hope of salvation. Says the
apostle, 'Christ our passover is sacrificed for us.' "—"Patriarchs and
Prophets," p. 277.
   "The Saviour desired to keep this feast alone with the twelve. He
knew that His hour was come; He Himself was the true paschal"
lamb, and on the day the Passover was eaten, He was to be sacrificed.
He was about to drink the cup of wrath; He must soon receive the
final baptism of suffering. But a few quiet hours yet remained to
Him, and these were to be spent for the benefit of His beloved dis-
ciples."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 642.
   5. Carrying water was usually woman's work in Palestine, hence
the sign Jesus gave was an unusual one. Note that He does not give
the man's name nor the location of the house. The preparations
which Peter and John were to make no doubt involved the provid-
ing of the lamb, the bitter herbs, the unleavened bread, and wine for
the Passover feast.

   We take great satisfaction in the fact that the Sabbath school les-
sons are published monthly for the blind, and that those who have
heretofore been without them may now have the blessing which comes
from their study. The texts are printed in full, but the notes are
omitted; many, however, are pleased to receive the lessons in this
form. Recently 326 copies were sent to blind people, 141 copies being
printed in the Revised Braille, and 185 in the New York Point. If
you have blind friends, the lessons may be secured for them from
the Christian Record Publishing Company, College View, Nebraska.

   "If the word of God were appreciated as it should be, both young
and old would possess an inward rectitude, a strength of principle,
that would enable them to resist temptation."—"Testimonies," vol. 8,

                        SETTING OF THE LESSON
   Jesus and His disciples entered the upper chamber where Peter
and John had made preparations for the Passover feast. Jesus knew
that He was soon to be put to death, and on this last evening they
were to be together He had much to say to them. But the disciples
were cherishing a bitter spirit, and were striving among themselves,
each desiring to be the greatest, and so were unprepared to hear and
understand the words of Jesus.

                               NOTES
   1. "There was 'a strife among them, which of them should be
accounted the greatest.' This contention, carried on in the presence
of Christ, grieved and wounded Him. The disciples clung to their
favorite idea that Christ would assert His power, and take His posi-
tion on the throne of David. And in heart each still longed for the
highest place in the kingdom. They had placed their own estimate
upon themselves and upon one another, and instead of regarding
their brethren as more worthy, they had placed themselves first. The
request of James and John to sit on the right and left of Christ's
throne, had excited the indignation of the others. That the two
brothers should presume to ask for the highest position, so stirred
the ten that alienation threatened. They felt that they were mis-
judged, that their fidelity and talents were not appreciated. Judas
was the most severe upon James and John.
   "When the disciples entered the supper room, their hearts were
full of resentful feelings. Judas pressed next to Christ on the left
side; John was on the right. If there was a highest place, Judas was
determined to have it, and that place was thought to be next to
Christ. And Judas was a traitor."—"The Desire of Ages," pp.
643, 644.
   2. "Another cause of dissension had arisen. At a feast it was
customary for a servant to wash the feet of the guests, and on this
                             [34 ]
occasion preparation had been made [by Peter and John] for the
service. The pitcher, the basin, and the towel were there, in readi-
ness for the feet-washing; but no servant was present, and it was
the disciples' part'to perform it. But each of the disciples, yielding
to wounded pride, determined not to act the part of a servantyAll
manifested a stoical unconcern, seeming unconscious that there was
anything for them to do. By their silence they refused to humble
themselves."—Id., p. 644.
    "Such girding was the common mark of a slave, by whom the
service of foot-washing was ordinarily performed."—"Life and
Times of Jesus," Edersheim, vol. 2, pp. 501, 502.
    3. "The service which Peter refused was the type of a higher
cleansing. Christ had come to wash the heart from the stain of sin.
In refusing to allow Christ to wasEhis feet, Peter was refusing the
higher cleansing included in the lower. He was really rejecting
his Lord. .
    "At the words, 'If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with Me.'
 Peter surrendered his pride and self-will. He could not endure the
thought of separation from Christ; that would have been death to
him. —"The Desire of Ages," p. 646.
     4. "When Jesus girded Himself with a towel to wash the dust
 from their feet, He desired by that very act to wash the alienation,
 jealousy, and pride from their hearts. This was of far more conse-
 quence than the washing of their dusty feet. With the spirit they
 then had, not one of them was prepared for communion with Christ.
 Until brought into a state of humility and love, they were not pre-
 pared to partake of the paschal supper, or to share in the memorial
 service which Christ was about to institute. Their hearts must be
 cleansed. Pride and self-seeking create dissension and hatred, but
 all this Jesus washed away in washing their feet. A change of feel-
 ing was brought about. Looking upon them, Jesus could say, `Ye
 are clean.' Now there was union of heart, love for one another.
 They had become humble and teachable. Except Judas, each was
 ready to concede to another the highest place. Now with subdued
 and grateful hearts they could receive Christ's words."—Ibid.
     5. "So far as Judas himself was concerned, Christ's work of love
 had been without avail. But not so as regards his fellow disciples.
  To them it was a lesson of lifelong influence. Ever would its ex-
 ample of tenderness and longsuffering mold their intercourse with
  the tempted and the erring. And it had other lessons. At the ordi-
  nation of the twelve, the disciples had greatly desired that Judas
  should become one of their number; and they had counted his acces-
  sion an event of much promise to the apostolic band. . . . But the
.methods he desired to introduce into Christ's Work were based upon
  worldly principles and were controlled by worldly policy."—"Edu-
 cation," p. 93.
    6. "Christ would have His disciples understand that although He
 had washed their feet, this did not in the least detract from His
 dignity. ... Being so infinitely superior, He imparted grace and sig-
 nificance to the service. No one was so exalted as Christ, and yet
 He stooped to the humblest duty."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 649.

                                NOTES
     1. "The communion service points to Christ's second coming. It
 was designed to keep this hope vivid in the minds of the disciples."
 -"The Desire of Ages," p. 659.
     2. "As we receive the bread and wine symbolizing, Christ's broken
 body and spilled blood, we in imagination join in the scene of com-
 munion in the upper chamber. We seem to be passing through the
 garden consecrated by the agony of Him who bore the sins of the
  world. We witness the struggle by which our reconciliation with
 God was obtained. Christ is set forth crucified among us.
     "Looking upon the crucified Redeemer, we more fully compre-
  hend the magnitude and meaning of the sacrifice made by the Majesty
  of heaven. The plan of salvation is glorified before us, and the
  thought of Calvary awakens living arid sacred emotions in our hearts.
  Praise to God and the Lamb will be in our hearts and on our lips
  for pride and self-worship can not flourish in the soul that keeps
• fresh in memory the scenes of Calvary."-(d., p. 66r.
     3. "At these words amazement and consternation seized them.
  They could not comprehend how any one of them could deal treach-
                                  [ 37 1
crously with their divine Teacher. For what cause could they betray
Him? and to whom? Whose heart could give birth to such a design?
Surely not one of the favored twelve."—Id., p. 654.
   4. "The disciples had •searchect one another's faces closely as they
asked, 'Lord, is it I?' And now the silence of Judas drew all eyes
to him. Amid the confusion of questionS and expressions of aston-
ishment, Judas had not heard the words of Jesus in answer to John's
question. But now, to escape the scrutiny of the disciples, he asked
as they had done, 'Master, is it I?' Jesus solemnly replied, 'Thou
bast said.' "—Ibid.
   5. "In surprise and confusion at the exposure of his purpose,
Judas rose hastily to leave the room. 'Then said Jesus unto him,
That thou doest, do quickly. . . . He then having received the sop
went immediately out : and it was night.' Night it was to the traitor
as he turned away from Christ into the outer darkness. Until this
step was taken, Judas had-not passed beyond the possibility of repent-
ance. But when he left the presence of his Lord and his fellow
disciples, the final decision had been made. He had passed the boun-
dary line."—Ibid.
    "Though Jesus knew Judas from the beginning, He washed his
feet. And the betrayer was privileged to unite with Christ in par-
taking- of the sacrament. . . This example is for us. When we
suppose one to be in error and sin, we are not to divorce ourselves
from him. . . Christ's example forbids exclusiveness at the Lord's
supper. It is true that open sin excludes the guilty. This the Holy
Spirit plainly teaches (I Cor. 5: ii). But beyond this none are to
pass judgment."—Id., pp. 655, 656.
    6. To love one another, was not a new precept. But never before
had the world witnessed such love as the love of Jesus. The new
feature of this command was "that ye love one another; as 1 have
loved you." John 13: ; Rom. 5 : 5 ; i John 3: 18, 54.
    7. The word "offended" as here used, does not mean angry as we
understand the word, but caused to stumble. Jesus knew that the
events soon to take place would cause the disciples disappointment
and fear. Instead of seeking a place close to Him, they would flee
to save their own lives, thus leaving Him alone.
   8. "Over and over again, on the very verge of ruin. Peter's words
of boasting brought him nearer and still nearer to the brink. Over
and over again was given the warning, 'Thou shalt . . deny that
thou knowest Me.' . . . When in the judgment hall the words of
denial had been spoken; when Peter's love and loyalty, awakened
under the Saviour's glance of pity and love and sorrow, had sent him
forth to the garden where Christ had wept and prayed; when his
tears of remorse dropped upon the sod that had been moistened
with the- blood-drops. of- His agony,—then the Saviour's - words, 'I
have prayed for thee; . . . when thou art converted, strengthen thy
brethren,' were a stay to his soul. Christ,.-though foreseeing his sin,
had.not:abandoned--him to despair."—"Education," p. 89.

     Let      cross. of. Christ he made the science of all education, the
center of - all teaching and alt study."—"2"e'stintonies," vol. 8, p. 32o.
