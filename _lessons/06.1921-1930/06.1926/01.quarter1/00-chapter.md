    ENROLL IN THE SABBATH SCHOOL
  You are not a member of the Sabbath school unless your
name is enrolled. There are persons who attend frequently,
but who, because their names are not recorded, can not be
counted, and so are among the "missing members."

                              LESSON 1
JESUS DINES WITH A PHARISEE; PARABLE
        OF THE GREAT SUPPER
                           January     2, 1926

                     SETTING OF THE LESSON
   "The Saviour was a guest at the feast of a Pharisee. He
accepted invitations from the rich as well as the poor, and, ac-
cording to His custom, He linked the scene before Him with
His lessons of truth. Among the Jews the sacred feast was
connected with all their seasons of national and religious re-
joicing. It was to them a type of the blessings of eternal life.
The great feast at which they were to sit down with Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob, while the gentiles stood without, and looked
on with longing eyes, was a theme on which .they delighted to
dwell."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 219.

                              NOTES
    1: The evidence is strong that the invitation for Jesus to dine
with this Pharisee was given for the purpose of affording oppor-
tunity to entrap Him in some way. Although knowing this, and
that eminent men,-rabbis and Pharisees, acting as spies,-would
be present, Jesus did not hesitate to accept the invitation. Before
the company reclined to eat, Jesus saw a poor afflicted man enter
the house, according to Oriental license. This gave Jesus occasion
for asking a direct question upon the topic which was no doubt
uppermost in the minds of many: "Is it lawful to heal on the
Sabbath?"
    2. "Christ's words were a rebuke to their selfishness. To the
Pharisees His words were distasteful. Hoping to turn' the con-
versation into another channel, one of them, with a sanctimonious
air, exclaimed, 'Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom.
of God.' This man spoke with great assurance, as if he himself
were certain of a place in the kingdom. His attitude was similar
to the attitude of those who rejoice that they are saved by Chris'
                                C 4]
when they do not comply with the conditions upon which salva-
tion is promised. . . . The Pharisee was not thinking of his own
fitness for heaven, but of what he hoped to enjoy in heaven. His
remark was designed to turn away the minds of the guests at
the feast from the subject of their practical duty. He thought
to carry them past the present life to the remote time of the res-
urrection of the just.
     "Christ read the heart of the pretender, and, fastening His
eyes upon him, He opened before the company the character and
value of their present privileges. He showed them that they had
a part to act at that very time, in order to share in the blessed-
ness of the future."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 221.
     3. It was the custom in Oriental countries to send a messenger
to summon the guests, previously invited, to a feast. To refuse
to keep the promise of acceptance without furnishing the host
with sufficient reason for the absence, was regarded as a grievous
insult.
     4. "All the excuses betray a preoccupied mind. To these in-
tended guests other interests had become all-absorbing. The in-
vitation they had pledged themselves to accept was put aside, and
 the generous friend was insulted by their indifference."—"Christ's
 Object Lessons," p. 222.
     5. A lesson of comfort and hope is taught by the urgency of
 the master of the feast. It was imperative that he have guests
 at his feast. "Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter
 therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in be-
 cause of unbelief : again, He limiteth a certain day, saying in
 David, To-day, after so long a time ; as it is said, To-day if ye
 will hear His voice, harden not yOur hearts." Heb. 4: 6, 7. There
 is none so poor and wretched but that he will be accepted as a
 guest. Such are entreated to come. They will make as worthy
 guests as any, since the robe and all the fitness that is necessary
 are supplied by the Lord. It is He that "hath made us meet to
 be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light." Col. 1: 12.
     6. The gospel invitation to accept Jesus as the Saviour was
  first given to the Jewish people, those who professed to serve
  God. When the priests and leaders refused to accept, the message
 was given to publicans and sinners, the poor, the halt, the blind.
 Afterward the gospel was preached to the gentiles.
      "We are living in a time when the last message of mercy, the,
 last invitation, is sounding to the children of men. The command,
  `Go out into the highways and hedges,' is reaching its final fulfill-
  ment. To every soul Christ's invitation will be given., The mes-
  sengers are saying, `Come; for all things are now ready.' Heav-
  enly angels are still working in cooperation with human agencies.
  The Holy Spirit is presenting every inducement to constrain you
"to come. Christ is watching for some sign that will betoken the
  removing of the bolts and the opening of the door of your heart
  for His entrance. Angels are waiting to bear the tidings to
                                   [5]
heaven that another lost sinner has been found. The hosts of
heaven are waiting, ready to strike their harps, and to sing a song
or rejoicing that another soul has accepted the invitation to the
gospel feast."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 237.


                            LESSON 2
          PARABLE OF THE LOST SHEEP;
                THE PRODIGAL
                         January 9, 1926
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Luke 15: 1-32.
PARALLEL SCRIPTURE: Matt. 18: 11-14.
MEMORY VERSE: Luke 15: 18.
LESSON HELP: "Christ's Object Lessons," pp. 185-211.
PLACE: Jesus was doubtless in Perea, the country east of the jgrdan, when
  He gave this instruction.
PERSONS: Jesus and His disciples; Pharisees, scribes, and publicans.

                     SETTING OF THE LESSON
    In the parable of the lost sheep, Jesus appealed to the experi-
ence of His hearers. "The wide spreading tablelands on the east
of Jordan afforded abundant pasturage for flocks, and through the
gorges and over the wooded hills had wandered many a lost
sheep, to be searched for and brought back by 'the shepherd's
care. In the company about Jesus there were shepherds, and
also men who had money invested in flocks and herds, and all
could appreciate His illustration."—"Christ's Object' Lessons,"
pp. 186, 187.
    The parable of the prodigal son has been called "the crown and
pearl of all our Lord's parables." A great English' writer refers
to it as "the most touching story in all literature."

                             NOTES
   1. "This parable, like the preceding, sets • forth the loss of
something which with proper search may be recovered, and that
with great joy. But the two parables represent different classes.
The lost sheep knows that it is lost. It has left.the shepherd and
the flock, and it can not recover itself. It represents those who
realize that they are separated from God, and who are in a cloud
of perplexity, in humiliation, and sorely tempted. The lost coin
represents those who are lost in trespasses and sins, but who have
no sense of their condition. They are estranged from God, but
they know it not. Their souls are in peril, but they are uncon-
scious and unconcerned. In this parable Christ teaches that even
                               [7 1
those who are indifferent to the claims of God, are the objects
of His pitying love. They are to be sought for, that they may be
brought back to God.                      •
    "The sheep wandered away from the fold; it was lost in. the
wilderness or upon the mountains. The piece of silver was lost
in the house. It was close at hand, yet it could be recovered only
by diligent search. This parable has a lesson to families. In the
household there-is often great carelessness concerning the souls
of its members."—"Christ's Object Lessons," pp. 193, 194.
   2. "In the parable of the prodigal son is presented the Lord's
dealing with those who have once known the Father's love, but
who have allowed the tempter to lead them captive at his will."7
Id., I). 198.
    "By the elder son were represented the unrepenting Jews of
Christ's day, and also the Pharisees in every age, who look with
contempt upon those whom they regard as publicans and sinners.
Because they themselves have not gone to great excesses in vice,
they are filled with self-righteousness. Christ met these cavilers
on their own ground. Like the elder son in the parable, they had
enjoyed special privileges from God. They claimed to be sons in
God's house, but they had the spirit of the hireling. They were
working, not from love, but from hope of reward:- In their eyes,
God was an exacting taskmaster. They saw Christ inviting pub-
licans and sinners to receive freely the gift of His grace,—the
gift which the rabbis hoped to secure only by toil and penance,—
and they were offended. The prodigal's return, which filled the
Father's heart with joy, only stirred them to jealousy."—Id.,
p. 209.
    3. According to Jewish law, the elder son would receive a
double portion, and each of the younger sons a single portion, of
the father's property at his death. Deut. 21 : 17. "The latter then
desired that his father, anticipating the division, should give him
the equivalent of his portion in money, an arrangement in virtue
of which the entire domain, on the father's death, would come
to the elder."—Godet.
    Unappreciative of his father's love, and restive under home
discipline, he ungratefully requests his inheritance. What is the
spiritual significance? "It is the expression of man's desire to be
independent of God, to be a god to himself (Gen. 3: 5), and to
lay out his life according to his own will and for his own pleas-
ure. It is man growing weary of living upon God and upon His
fullness, and desiring to take the ordering of his life into his own
hands, and believing that he can be a fountain of blessedness to
himself. All the subsequent sins of the younger son are included
in this one, as in their germ,—are but the unfolding of this the
sin of sins."—Trench.
    4. "Whatever the appearance may be, every life centered in
self is squandered. Whoever attempts to live apart from God, is
wasting his substance. He is squandering the precious years,
                                 [8 1
squandering the powers of mind and heart and soul, and working
to make himself bankrupt for eternity. The man who separates
from God that he may serve himself, is the slave of mammon.
The mind that God created for the companionship of angels, has
become degraded to the service of that which is earthly and
bestial. This is the end to which self-serving tends."—"Christ's
Object Lessons," pp. 200, 201.
   5. "Little did the gay, thoughtless youth, as he went out from
his father's gate, dream of the ache and longing left in that fa-
ther's heart. When he danced and feasted with his wild compan-
ions, little did he think of the shadow that had fallen on his
home. And now as with weary and painful steps he pursues the
homeward way, he knows not that one is watching' for his re-
turn. But while he is yet 'a great way off,' the father discerns his
form. Love is of quick sight. Not even the degradation of the
years of sin can conceal the son from the father's eyes. He 'had
compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck' in a long, clinging,
tender embrace."—/d., p. 203.
   6. The great sin of the younger son was lack of appreciation
of his father's love. The elder brother was self-righteous, and
was working for the benefits that would accrue to him. He mis-
interpreted his father's love, and was hard-hearted toward' his
brother. The father does not give him merited rebuke, but ten-
derly pleads with him, to, show him his error.

                           LESSON 3
                THE UNJUST STEWARD
                       January 16, 1926
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Luke' 16: 1-15.
MEMORY VERSE: Luke 16: 10.
LESSON HELP: "Christ's Object Lessons," pp. 366-375.
PLACE: Perea, east of the Jordan.
PERSONS: Jesus and His disciples; Pharisees and publicans.

                    SETTING OF THE LESSON.
   "The Saviour had been censured by the Pharisees for ming-
ling with publicans and sinners; but His interest in them was not
lessened, nor did His efforts for them cease. He saw that their
employment brought them into temptation. They were sur-
rounded by enticements to evil. The first wrong step was, easy,
and the descent was rapid to greater dishonesty and increased
crimes. Christ was seeking by every means to win them to higher
aims and nobler principles. This purpose He had in mind in the
story of the unfaithful steward. There had been among the'
publicans just such a case as that represented • in the parable,
and in Christ's description they recognized their own practices.
                                 (9]
Their attention was arrested, and from the picture of their own
dishonest, practices many of them learned a lesson of spiritual
truth."-"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 368.

                              NOTES
     I. The definition given for the word "steward" is : "A per-
son intrusted with the management of estates or affairs not his
own; hence, one who manages or disburses for another or others.
An agent appointed by a lord of the manor, or other great land-
lord, to lease lands, collect rents, etc."
    2. The solemnity of our individual responsibility in the day
when it shall be said to us, "Give an account of thy stewardship,"
is well set forth in the following paragraphs:
    "Christian stewardship has its final issue in the reckoning be-
fore Him for whom men have been stewards. The wage earner
and the millionaire, the one who had the least committed to him
and the one who had the most, each must stand before the judg-
ment seat of Christ and have their gettings and their givings,
their accumulations and their expenditures, their motives and
their methods, brought under the searching scrutiny of Him
whose eyes are as a flame of fire. All wrong ways of getting
money, all fraud and dishonesty and oppression, together with all
wrong ways of using and spending money, will be laid bare -in
that day. All withholding from God, all selfishness and covet-
ousness, all wastefulness and extravagance, all spending of
money to gratify pride or sensual desires, will be seen in the light
of the eternal throne, and no cloak of respectability or religious-
ness, no paltry excuse, such as is so often made by those who do
not give, will be able to conceal or extenuate any blemish or flaw
in, any man's stewardship. Every man will be rewarded accord-
ing as his works have been.
    "On the other hand, all diligence and fidelity in the service of
God as His stewards, all getting and giving for God's glory, all
prayerfulness and consecration, all unselfishness and liberality
and self-sacrifice, whether by those who have had little, or by
those who had much, will be remembered by the Lord of those
servants."—"Stewardship and Missions," pp. 167, 168.
    3. Dr. Adam Clarke comments thus on Luke 16: 3 : " 'I can
not dig': He could not submit to become a common day laborer,
which was both a severe and base employment: `To beg I am
ashamed.' And as these were the only honest ways left him to
procure a morsel of bread, and he would not submit to either, he
found he must continue the system of knavery, in order to pro-
vide for his idleness and luxury, or else starve. Woe to the man
who gets his bread in this way! The curse of the Lord must be
on his head, and on his heart ; in his basket, and in his store."
     4. "The worldly man praised the sharpness of the man who
had defrauded him. But the rich man's commendation was not
the commendation of God. Christ did not commend -the unjust
steward, but He made use of a well-known occurrence to illus-
trate the lesson He desired to teach."—"Christ's Object Lessons,"
 p. 367.
     5. "After relating the parable, Christ said, 'The children of
this world are in their generation wiser than the children of
                                 [11 ]
light.' That is, worldly-wise men display more wisdom and ear-
nestness in serving themselves than do the professed children of
God in their service to Him. So it was in Christ's day. So it is
now. Look at the life of many who claim to be Christians. The
Lord has endowed them with capabilities, and power, and influ-
ence; He has intrusted them with money, that they may be co-
workers with Him in the great redemption. All His gifts are to
be used in blessing humanity, in relieving the suffering and the
needy. . . . The means over and above the actual necessities of
life are intrusted to man to do good, to bless humanity."—Id.,
   370.
    6.," 'Make to yourselves friends by means of the mammon of
unrighteousness,' Christ says, 'that when it shall fail, they may
receive you into the eternal tabernacles.' God and Christ and
angels are all ministering to the afflicted, the suffering, and the
sinful. Give yourself to- God for this work, use His gifts for
this purpose, and you enter into partnership with heavenly beings.
Your heart will throb in sympathy with theirs. You will be as-.
similated to them in character. To you these dwellers in the
eternal tabernacles will not be strangers. When earthly things
shall have passed away, the watchers at heaven's gates will bid
you welcome."—Id., p. 373.

18. After this, where did Jesus go? Verse 54.
                             NOTES
    1. "They [Mary and Martha] thought that He [Jesus] would
immediately respond to their message, and be with them as soon
as He could reach Bethany.
    "Anxiously they waited for a word 'from Jesus. As long as the
spark of life was yet alive in their brother, they prayed and
watched for Jesus to come. But the messenger returned without
Him. Yet he brought the message, 'This sickness is not unto
death,' and they clung to the hope that Lazarus would live.
Tenderly they tried to speak words of hope and encouragement
to the almost unconscious sufferer. When Lazarus died, they
were bitterly disappointed; but they felt the sustaining grace of
Christ, and this kept them from reflecting any blame on the
Saviour."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 526.
   2. Jesus answered the objections of the disciples by saying,
"'Are there not twelve hours in the day?' I am under the guid-
ance of My Father; as long as I do His will, My life is safe. My
twelve hours of day are not yet ended. I have entered , upon the
last remnant of My day; but while any of this remains, I am
safe."—Id., p. 527. •
   3. "On His journey to Bethany, Jesus, according to His cus-
tom, ministered to the sick and the needy. Upon reaching the
town He sent a messenger to the sisters with the tidings of His
arrival. Christ did not at once enter the house, but remained
in a quiet place by the wayside. The great outward display ob-
served by the Jews at the death of friends or relatives was not
in harmony with the spirit of Christ. He heard the sound of
wailing from the hired mourners, and He did not wish to meet
the sisters in the scene of confusion. Among the, mourning
friends were relatives of the .family, some of whom held high
positions of responsibility in Jerusalem. Among these were some
of Christ's bitterest enemies. Christ knew their purposes, and
therefore He did not at once make Himself known.
    "The message was given to Martha so quietly that others in
the room did not hear. Absorbed in her grief, Mary did not
hear the words. Rising at once, Martha went out to meet her
Lord, but thinking that she had gone to the place where Lazarus
was buried, Mary sat still in her sorrow, making no outcry."—
Id., p. 529.
    4. It is worthy of note that the absence of Jesus meant death,
His coming, life; "Lord, if Thou hadst been here, my brother
had not died." He is not the death-bringer, but the Life-giver.
    5. "Still seeking to give a true direction to her faith, Jesus
declared, 'I am the resurrection, and the life.' In Christ is life,
                               [ 14 ]
 original, unborrowed, underived. 'He that hath the Son hath
 life.' The divinity of Christ is the believer's assurance of eter-
 nal life: . . . Christ here looks forward to the time of .,His
 second coming. Then the righteous dead shall be raised incor-
 ruptible, and the living righteous shall be translated to heaven
 without seeing death. The miracle which Christ was about to
 perform, in raising Lazarus from the dead, would represent the
 resurrection of all the righteous dead. By His word and His
 works He declared Himself .the Author of the resurrection. He
 who Himself was soon to die upon the cross, stood with the keys
of death, a conqueror of the grave, and asserted His right and
 power to give eternal life."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 530.
    6. "He [Jesus] read the hearts of all assembled. He saw
 that with many, what passed as a demonstration of grief was
only pretense. He knew that some in the company, now mani-
 festing hypocritical sorrow, would erelong be planning the death,
not only of the mighty Miracle-worker, but of the one to be
 raised from the dead."—Id., p. 533.
    "It was not only because of the scene before Him that Christ
 wept. The weight of the grief of ages was upon Him. . . .
Looking down the years to come, He saw the suffering and
sorrow, tears and death, that were to be the lot of men. His
heart was pierced with the pain of the human family of all ages
and in all lands."—Id., p. 534.
    7. "Lazarus is set free, and stands before the company, not
as one emaciated from disease, and with feeble, tottering limbs,
but as a man in the prime of life, and in the vigor of a noble
manhood. His eyes beam with intelligence and with, love for
his Saviour. He casts himself in adoration at the feet of Jesus.
    "The beholders are at first speechless with amazement. Then
there follows an inexpressible scene of rejoicing and thanksgiv-
ing. The sisters receive their' brother back to life as the gift of
God, and with joyful tears they brokenly express their thanks
to the Saviour. But while brother, sisters, and friends are re-
joicing in this reunion, Jesus withdraws from the scene. When
they look for the Life-giver, He is not to be found."—Id., p. 536.
    8. "In declaring that one man should die for the nation,
Caiaphas indicated that he had some knowledge of the prophecies,
although it was very limited. But John, in his account of this
scene, takes up the, prophecy, and shows its broad and deep sig- •
nificance. He says, 'And not for that nation only, but that also
He should gather together in one the children of God that were
scattered abroad.' How blindly did the haughty Caiaphas ac-
knowledge the Saviour's mission!
    "On tle lips of Caiaphas this most precious truth was turned
into a. lie. The policy he advocated was baste' on a principle
borrowed from heathenism. Among the heathen, the dim con-
sciousness that one-was to die for the human race, had led to the
offering of human sacrifices. So Caiaphas proposed by the sacri-
fice of Jesus to save the guilty nation, not from transgression,
                              [ 15 ]
but in transgression, that they might continue in sin. And by his
reasoning he thought to silence the remonstrances of those who
might dare to say that as yet nothing worthy of death had been
found in Jesus."—Id., P. 54o.

                             NOTES
    1. Too many people mistake the meaning of the parable of the
unjust judge. It is not an illustration of how God deals with
men, and an indication that we shall receive notice from God
only by repeated effort. God is just, and the judge was unjust.
There is no comparison, but a sharp contrast, between God and
the judge. God is listening to hear before we ask. I Peter 3: 12.
He has provided the way for us to come to Him, and asks us to
come boldly. He delights in mercy. Micah 7: 18. The reason
why we are to be encouraged to continue instant in prayer, and
not to faint, is that God is so kind and ready to give. ROm. 8: 32.
    2. "The widow's prayer, 'Avenge me'-`do me justice'-`of
mine adversary,' represents the prayer of God's children. Satan
is their great adversary. He is the 'accuser of our brethren.'
who accuses them before God day and night. He is continually
working to misrepresent and accuse, to deceive and destroy the
people of God. And it is for deliverance from the power of
Satan and his agents that in this parable Christ teaches His dis-
ciples to pray."-"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 166.
    3. "Give me these links,-(t) sense of need; (2) desire to
get; (3) belief that God has it in store; (4) belief that though
                               [17 ]
  He withholds a while, He loves to be asked; and (5) belief that
  asking will obtain—give me these links, and the chain will reach
  from earth to heaven, bringing. heaven all down to me, or bearing
  me up into heaven."—Willion Arnot.
      4. Standing was an ordinary attitude ; but the word used to
 describe the Pharisee's position "differs from that used to desig-
  nate the publican's standing, and gives a very different impression.
  It means that he stationed himself, struck an attitude, ostenta-
 tiously."—Vincent. How different the attitude of the poor publi-
 can, who, feeling himself unworthy to mingle with other worship-
 ers or approach near the altar, "stood afar off" with bowed
  head and downcast eyes. The publican's sense of his own sin-
  fulness did not allow any comparison with others.
      5—The Pharisee did not pray in the sense of offering a peti-
 tion or thanksgiving to God. It was communing with himself,
 and boasting in the name of thanksgiving. "The nearer we come
 to Jesus, and the more clearly we discern the-purity of His char-
 acter, the more clearly we shall discern the exceeding sinfulness of
 sin, and the less we shall feel like exalting ourselves. Those whom
 heaven recognizes as holy ones are the last to parade their own
 goodness."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 160.
     6. He who measures himself by others is living by a low
 standard. Yet how natural it is to do it! H. Clay Trumbull says:
 "Even of those who admit that they are not righteous, most feel
 sure that they are not the worst men in the world; and they are
 glad of it. Men who will lie, boast that they do not steal. Men
.who will lie and steal, are glad that they are not drunkards. Men
 who are liars, thieves, and drunkards, take comfort in the thought
 that they have never been licentious. Men who know that they
 have broken every commandment of the moral law, thank God
 that they are not hypocrites and make no pretense to decency.
    . . The echo of the Pharisee's prayer fills the air to-day; and
 it is a very rare thing to find a person anywhere who does not
 think he is better than most men, if not better than all."
     7. "There is nothing so offensive to God, or so dangerous to
 the human soul, as pride, and self-sufficiency. Of all sins it is the
 most hopeless, the most incurable."—"Christ's Object Lessons,"
 p. 154.
     8. A shepherd, when asked the secret of his success in raising
 such a fine flock of sheep, said, "I take care of the lambs." How
 many to-day, like the disciples, say, in actions if not in words,
 that the work of God is too important to stop to give attention
 to the children ! Children are hindered (I) by a lack of interest
 in religious things and proper religious instruction on the part
 of the parents in the home; (2) by neglect of their' religious
 education; (3) by conduct of the church services with little or
 no regard to the lambs of the flock, thus making the church
 services distasteful to them; (4) by criticism of the .lurch and
 Christian workers in their presence.

17. What statement did Jesus add? Verse 3o.
                              NOTES
   1. We do not understand that Jesus' reply was a rebuke, or a
denial that Christ was good, but rather an attempt to lead the
young man toward the only ideal of good,—the only source of
good. The ruler used the common title of respect for a teacher ;
but Christ desired to test his sincerity, and to lead him to declare
whether he regarded Him merely as any other teacher, or if he
recognized Him as the Son of God.
   2. God's "commandments are righteousness" (Ps. II9 : 172),
and "in the way of righteousness is life" (Prov. 52: 28). That we
can not of ourselves keep the law, does not lessen our obligation,
especially when the promise of God is that our righteousness is
of Him. Isa. 54: 17. The sinner who truly seeks with all his
heart, over his repeated failures it may be, to do God's will, shall
find Christ the door. Rom. 7: 24, 25: 8: 1-3. In seeking to keep
the commandments in their spiritual fullness, the young man
would have understood his personal need, and accepted Christ,
whom to know aright is life eternal.
   3. No doubt this young man's life conformed outwardly to
the letter of the law. Perhaps he could recall no special act of
disobedience. But if he had been satisfied, he would not have
sought Jesus.
   4. " 'One thing thou lackest,' Jesus said. 'If thou wilt be
perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou
shalt have treasure in heaven, and come and follow Me.' Christ
read the ruler's heart. Only one thing he lacked, but that was a
vital principle. He needed the love of God in the soul. This lack,
unless supplied, would prove fatal to him; his whole nature would
become corrupted. By indulgence, selfishness would strengthen.
That he might receive the love of God, his supreme love of self
must be surrendered. . . .
                               [ 20J
    "His claim that he had kept the law of God was a deception.
He showed that riches were his idol. He could not keep the
commandments of God while the world was first in his affections.
He loved the gifts of God more than he loved the Giver. Christ
had offered the young man fellowship with Himself. 'Follow
Me,' He said. But the Saviour was not so much to him as his
own name among men or his possessions. To give up his earthly
treasure, that was seen, for the heavenly treasure, that was un-
seen, was too great a risk. He refused the offer of eternal life,
and went away, and ever after the world was to receive his wor-
ship."—"The Desire of Ages," pp. 519, 520.
    5. According to the young man's testimony, he had observed
the commandment not to covet anything that was his neighbor's,
and so had caught the negative view of this commandment. But
the idea that he should take his own goods and give them to the
poor, was too severe a test for him, even though Jesus had prom-
ised him "treasure in heaven" in return. There was an idol in
 his heart which stood in the way of the perfect keeping of the
commandments. Our idol may not be riches, but still may con-
stitute some other god before Jehovah.
     6. Jesus recognized the danger of riches' weaning the heart
 away from God. One who loves his riches makes an idol of
 them, trusts in theni. One who so cherishes his possessions can
 not be truly following the Saviour. God intrusts men with means
 that they may be His agents in helping the poor, and in advancing
 His work in the earth.
     7. Jesus promised a hundredfold in value in the blessings
 received. "Even the young ruler would have received an hun-
 dredfold. Now his name is unknown, his influence unfelt. In a
 few years his possessions were ravaged by the Roman legions,
 while the disciples introduced a new and blessed kingdom on
 earth, whose influence is widening all down the ages. And in
 this he might haye had a part, rejoicing in the triumph, and filled
 with immortal joy; and in the world to come life everlasting—
  the eternal life the young ruler wanted so much, but refused to
  accept."—Peloubet.

                              NOTES
    is All the parables of Jesus are given to illustrate' one dis-
tinct truth or phase of truth. In studying them, we do well not
to lose the point among the details of the setting. Jesus often
makes the application Himself, as He did here. In order to
appreciate His conclusion, one must study the setting carefully.
    2. The Roman denarius, here translated "penny," was equiva-
lent to about seventeen cents. In the parable, this definite wage
was agreed upon as satisfactory to both the householder and the '
laborers first hired.
    3. Settlement for the day's labor began with the last employed.
If the laborers had received their pay in the order in which they
were hired, the first might have received their pennies and gone
on their way satisfied. But the greed and envy in their hearts
was revealed as soon as they saw others faring better than them-
selves. Selfishness can never enter heaven. This parable teaches
also that eternal life is not earned, but bestowed out of the grace
and love in the heart of the Giver.
    4. "In the parable the first laborers agreed to work for a
stipulated sum, and they received the amount specified, nothing
more. Those later hired believed the master's promise, 'Whatso-
ever is right, that shall ye receive.' They showed their confidence
in him by asking no question in regard to wages. They trusted
to his justice and equity. They were rewarded, not according to
the amount of their labor, but according to the generosity of his
purpose."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 397.
    5. "This parable does not excuse those who hear the first
call to labor, but who neglect to enter the Lord's vineyard. When
the householder went to the market-place at the eleventh hour,.
and found men unemployed, he said, 'Why stand ye here all the
day idle?' The answer was, 'Because no man hath hired us.'
None of those called later in the day were there in the morning.
They had not refused the call. Those who refuse and afterward
repent, do weH to repent; but it is not safe to trifle with the first
call of mercy."—Id., p. 399.
    6. "The householder's dealing with ,the workers in his vine-
yard represents God's dealing with the human family. It is
contrary to the customs that prevail among men. In worldly busi-
ness, compensation is given according to the work accomplished.
The laborer expects to be paid only that which he earns. But in
the parable, Christ was illustrating the principles of His king-
dom,—a kingdom not of this world. He is not controlled by any
human standard. . . .
    "Not the, amount of labor performed, or its visible results,
but the spirit in which the work is done, makes it of value with
God. Those who came into the vineyard at the eleventh hour
were thankful for an opportunity to work. Their hearts *ere
full of gratitude to the one who had accepted them; and when
at the close of the day the householder paid them for a full day's
                               [ 237
work, they were greatly surprised. They knew they had not
earned such wages. And the kindness expressed in the counte-
nance of their employer filled them with joy. They never forgot
the goodness of the householder, or the generous compensation
they had received. Thus it is with the sinner, who, knowing his
unworthiness, has entered the Master's vineyard at the eleventh
hour. His time of service seems so short, he feels that he is un-
deserving of reward; but he is filled with joy that God has ac-
cepted him at all. He works with a humble, trusting spirit,
thankful for the privilege of being a coworker with Christ. This
spirit God delights to honor."—Id., pp. 396-398.
    7. "The Jews had been first called into the Lord's vineyard;
and because of this they were proud and self-righteous. Their
long years of service they regarded as entitling them to receive
a larger reward than others. Nothing was more exasperating
to them than an intimation that the gentiles were to be admitted
to equal privileges with themselves in the things of God."—Id.,
P. 400.

    "The time of the Passover was drawing near, and again Jesus
turned toward Jerusalem. In His heart was the peace of perfect
onenesS. With the Father's will, and with eager steps He pressed
citi'tbimard the place of sacrifice. But a sense of mystery, of doubt
and ikar, fell upon the disciples. The Saviour 'went before them,
anti they were amazed, and as they followed, they were afraid.'
    "Again Christ called the twelve about Him, and with greater
definiteness than ever before, He opened to them His betrayal
and, sufferings."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 547.
 . All the Jewish men were required to attend the Passover
feast, .and the roads were doubtless thronged with travelers.

                                  NOTES
   1. Since the time of His rejection in Galilee, Jesus had been
walking as it were in the shadow of the cross. He had endeav-
ored to give the twelve a true understanding of the nature of
His work on earth, and to prepare them for the supreme crisis
before them. Matt. 16 : 21 ; 17 : 22, 23. As they journeyed toward
Jerusalem, Jesus told the disciples in detail the things that should
come to pass.
                                      25
    2. The disciples knew the dangers that threatened Jesus. On
 this account, they had objected to His going to Judea at the time
 of the sickness of Lazarus, and at that time the Sanhedrin had
 again determined upon His death. Now His face is turned
 steadily toward Jerusalem again. Knowing these things, and yet
 thinking of a temporal kingdom and the twelve thrones that had
 recently been promised them (Matt. 19:28), the apostles must
 have been greatly troubled and confused.
    3. By referring to Matt. 4: 21, we recall that "Zebedee's
 children" were James and John, whom Jesus had called next
 after Simon Peter and Andrew, to become His disciples. John
 is mentioned as "the disciple whom Jesus loved."
    "At every possible opportunity, John took his place next the
 Saviour, and James longed to be honored with as close connec-
 tion with Him. Their mother was a follower of Christ, and had
 ministered to Him freely of her substance. With a mother's
 love and ambition for her sons, she coveted for them the most
 honored place in the new kingdom. For this she encouraged
 them to make request."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 548.
    4. How far-reaching was Jesus' answer, "Ye know not, what
ye ask." The mother and her sons asked for a certain result, or
final attainment, which was uppermost in their minds. Jesus
 saw all that was implied in the question,—the experience neces-
 sary to realize their wish. Our prayers are often thus blind or
 limited in comprehension. We too often ask for something we
 long for, without sensing what the answer to our request would
 mean. Then when the Lord grants our petition by sending us
 the experience by which it is necessary for us to realize our own
desire, we think that something strange has happened to us, and
 take a rebellious attitude toward it. Should not part of our
 prayer always be, "Lord, make us to know what we ask, and to
 recognize the answer when it comes"?
       "In the kingdom of God, position is not gained through
 favoritism. It is not earned, nor is it received through an arbi-
trary bestowal. It is the result of character.' The crown and the
throne are the tokens of a condition attained; they are the' tokens
of self-conquest through our Lord Jesus Christ."—"The Desire
of Ages," P. 549.
    6. "Christ was establishing a kingdom on different principles.
He called men, not to authority, but to service, the strong to bear
the infirmities of the weak. Power, position, talept, education,
placed their possessor under the greater obligation to serve his
fellows."—Id., p. 55o.
    7. "The one who stands nearest to Christ will be he who on
earth has drunk most deeply of the spirit of His self-sacrificing
love."—Id., p. 549.
    In Matt. 20: 25-28, rthe spirit of the world and the spirit
of Christ are clearly. contrasted. Nearly all the evils that have
come into God's churCh have been a result of .disregarding this
principle, and have sprung from the desire to be honored and to
rule, rather than to serve.

                     SETTING OF THE LESSON
    The road Jesus was traveling to Jerusalem led through Jer-
icho, a city watered by living springs, and beautified by palm
trees and rich gardens. "Jericho was one of the cities anciently
set apart for the priests, and at this time large numbers of priests
had their residence there. But the city had also a population
of a widely different character. It was a great center of traffic,
and Roman officials and soldiers, with strangers from different
quarters, were found there, while the collection of customs made
it the home of many publicans. 'The chief among the publicans,'
Zaccheus, was a Jew, and detested by his countrymen."—"The
Desire of Ages," p. 552.

                              NOTES
    1. "Matthew speaks of two blind men, Mark and Luke mention
only one of them, Bartimxus, who may have been either previously
or subsequently better known. A more important difference is,
that Matthew and Mark describe the miracle as having been per-
formed after our Lord's departure from Jericho, while Luke says
that it was during His approach to the city. . . . The true solution
of the difficulty seems to lie in the fact that our Lord probably
spent some days in Jericho or its vicinity, and while there would
naturally have made excursions 'into the country. Very possibly
He spent His nights at some house in the country and came into
the city during the day, as was His custom at Jerusalem, and as is
still often done by travelers in the East. A miracle performed
when He had thus gone into the country, and was nearing the
city on His return, might naturally be described by one evangelist
as taking place when He had gone out of the city, and by another
with more particularity, as being performed on His approach to the
city."—Gardiner, quoted in "A Critical Harmony of the Gospels,"
by Cadman.
    2. The taxes imposed on subject nations by Rome were"
farmed out to wealthy men who would pay a definite sum for
the privilege of collecting them. These men would subcontract
the work to tax-gatherers in the same way. The system was
productive of a great deal of dishonesty and extortion. It is
probable that Zaccheus had the contract to collect the customs at
Jericho, and had tax-collectors, or publicans, working under him.

berry in appearance, size, and foliage, but belonging, generically,
to the fig 'trees. It grows to a great size- and height."—Curry.
    4. "The wealthy customs officer was not altogether the hard-
ened man of the world that he seemed. Beneath the appearance
of worldliness and pride was a heart susceptible to divine influ-
ences. Zaccheus had heard of Jesus. The report of One who
had borne Himself with kindness and courtesy toward the pro-
scribed classes, had spread far and wide. In this chief of the
publicans was awakened a longing for a better life. Only a few
miles from Jericho, John the Baptist had preached at the Jordan,
and Zaccheus had heard of the call to repentance. The instruc-
tion to the publicans, 'Exact no more than that which is appointed
you,' though outwardly disregarded, had impressed his mind. He
knew the Scriptures, and was convicted that his practice was
wrong. Now, hearing the words reported to have come from
the great Teacher, he felt that he was a sinner in the sight of
God. Yet what he had heard of Jesus kindled hope in his heart."
 —"The Desire of Ages," p. 553.
     5. "No repentance is genuine that does not work reformation.
The righteousness of Christ is not a cloak to cover unconfessed
 and unforsaken sin; it is a principle of life that transforms the
 character and controls the conduct. Holiness is wholeness for
 God; it is the entire surrender of heart and life to the indwelling
 of the principles of heaven."—Id., p. 555.
  . 6. "He also is a son of Abraham." Jesus did not here refer
 to his family connection as a descendant from Abraham. Sal-
 vation on this basis was universally held by the Jews, and was
 one of their great errors, for which Jesus often corrected them.
 "We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man,"
 said the caviling Pharisees. But Jesus replied: "I know that ye
 are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill Me, because My word
 hath no place in you. . . . If ye were Abraham's children, ye
 would do the works of Abraham." John 8: 33, 37, 39.
     "Before Zaccheus had looked upon the face of Christ, he had
 begun the work that made him manifest as a true penitent."—
 "The Desire of Ages," p. 555. It was because of this that sal-
 vation came to his house. (See Gal. 3:7, 29.)

                 SETTING OF THE LESSON
   "The Saviour had reached Bethany only six days before the
Passover, and according to His custom had sought rest at the
home of Lazarus. The crowds of travelers who passed on to
the city, spread the tidings that He was on His way to Jeru-
salem, and that He would rest over the Sabbath at Bethany.
Among the people there• was great enthusiasm. Many flocked
to Bethany, some out of sympathy with Jesus, and others from
curiosity to see one who had been raised from the dead."—"The
Desire of Ages," p. 557•
   So far as we know, this is the first time Jesus had been at
Bethany since Lazarus was raised from the dead.

                            NOTES
    1. "Simon -of Bethany was accounted a disciple of Jesus. He
was one of the few Pharisees who had openly joined Christ's
followers. He acknowledged Jesus as a teacher, and hoped that
He might be the Messiah, but he had not accepted Him as a
Saviour. His character was not transformed; his principles were
unchanged. Simon had been healed of the leprosy, and it was
this that had drawn him to Jesus. He desired to show his grati-
tude, and at Christ's last visit to Bethany he made a feast for
the Saviour and His disciples."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 557.
    2. At this feast, there sat with Jesus both Simon, the healed
leper, and Lazarus, whom Jesus had raised from the dead. Then
Mary, who had been cleansed of seven devils, and had been led
into sin by this same Simon the leper, was there to pour out her
soul in deep gratitude for the forgiveness of sins, as symbolized
by the precious ointment she used. Simon, too, repented on this
occasion, and obtained forgiveness. Wonderful• gathering at this
His last visit to Bethany of those who had been objects of Jesus'
special mercy!
    3. "Judas had a high opinion of his own executive ability.
 As a financier he thought himself greatly superior to his fellow
disciples, and 'lie had led them to regard him in the same light.
He had gained their confidence, and had a strong influence over
 them. ' His professed sympathy for the poor deceived them, and
 his artful insinuation caused them to look distrustfully upon
 Mary's devbtion. The murmur passed round the table, 'To what
                              1 31
purpose is this waste? for this ointment might have been sold
for much, and given to the poor.'"—"The Desire of Ages," p. 559.
    4. "The fragrant gift which Mary had thought to lavish upon
the dead body of the Saviour, she poured upon His living form.
At the burial its sweetness could only have pervaded the tomb,
now it gladdened His heart with the assurance of her faith and
love. Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus offered not their gift
of love to Jesus in His life. With bitter tears they brought their
costly spices for His cold, unconscious form. The women who
bore spices to the tomb found their errand in vain, for He had
risen. But Mary, pouring out her love upon the Saviour while
He was conscious of her devotion,• was anointing Him for the
burial. And as He went down into the darkness of His great
trial, He carried with Him the memory of that deed, an earnest
of the love that would be His from His redeemed ones forever."
—Id., p. 56o.
    5. "Simon the host had been influenced by the criticism of
Judas upon Mary's gift, and he was surprised at the conduct of
Jesus. His Pharisaic pride was offended. . . . But it was
Simon's ignorance of God and of Christ that led him to think
as he did. He did not realize that God's Son must act in God's
way, with compassion, tenderness, and mercy. Simon's way was
to take no notice of Mary's penitent service. Her act of kissing
Christ's feet and anointing them with ointment was exasperating
to his hard-heartedness. He thought that if Christ were a
prophet, He would recognize sinners and rebuke them."—Id.,
p. 566.
    6. "By the two debtors of the parable, Simon and the woman
were represented. Jesus did not design to teach that different
degrees of obligation should be felt by the two persons, for each
owed a debt of gratitude that never could be repaid. But Simon
felt himself more righteous than Mary, and Jesus desired him to
see how great his guilt really was. He would show him that his
sin was greater than hers, as much greater as a debt of five hun-
dred pence exceeds a debt of fifty pence."—Id•., pp. 566, 567.
"Stern denunciation would have hardened Simon against repent-
ance, but patient admonition convinced him of his error. He
saw the magnitude of the debt which he owed his Lord. His
pride was humbled, he repented, and the proud Pharisee became
a lowly, self-sacrificing disciple."—Id., pp. 567, 568.
    7. "When to human eyes her case appeared hopeless, Christ
saw in Mary capabilities for good. He saw the better'traits of
her character. The plan of redemption has invested humanity
with great possibilities, and in Mary these possibilities were to
be realized. Through His grace she became a partaker 9f the
divine nature. The one who had fallen, and whose mind had
been a habitation of demons, was brought very near to the Sav-
iour in fellowship and ministry. It was Mary who sat at His
feet and learned of Him. It was Mary who poured upon His
head the precious anointing oil, and bathed His • feet' with her
                              I 32 ]
tears. Mary stood beside the cross, and followed Him to the
sepulcher. Mary was first at the tomb after His resurrection.
It was Mary who first proclaimed a risen Saviour."—Id., p. 568.
   8. "Many expected to hear from Laiarus a wonderful account
of scenes witnessed after death. They were surprised that he
told them nothing. He had nothing of this kind to tell. Inspira-
tion declares, 'The dead know not anything. . . . Their love, and
their hatred, and their envy is now perished.' But Lazarus did
have a wonderful testimony to bear in regard to the work of
Christ. He had been raised from the dead for this purpose.
With assurance and power he declared that Jesus was the Son
of God."—Id., pp. 557, 558.
                 "How oft we, careless, wait till life's
                    Sweet opportunities are past,
                  And break our 'alabaster box
                    Of ointment' at the very last!
                  0, let us heed the living friend
                    Who walks with us life's common ways,
                  Watching our eyes for look of love,
                    And hungering for a word of praise."

prophecy is now to be fulfilled. He who has so long refused
royal honors, now comes to Jerusalem as the promised heir to
David's throne.
    "It was on the first day of the week that Christ made His
triumphal entry into Jerusalem. Multitudes who had flocked to
see Him at Bethany, now accompanied Him, eager to witness
His reception. Many people were on their way to the city to
keep the Passover, and these joined the multitude attending
Jesus. All nature seemed to rejoice. The trees were clothed
with verdure, and their blossoms shed a delicate fragrance on
the air. A new life.and joy animated the people. The hope of
the new kingdom was again springing up."—"The Desire of Ages,"

                             NOTES
    1. The name "Bethphage" means "place of figs." It was a
village near Bethany, on or near the road from Jericho to Jeru-
salem. Mark mentions both villages. Bethphage probably stood
between Bethany and Jerusalem, near the descent from the Mount
of Olives, and not far from the old road that crosses the moun-
tain at the summit.
    2. The term "Hosanna" is derived from the Hebrew, and
means, "Save, I pray" or "Save now." It is found in the opening
part of Ps. 118: 25.
    3. The very question, "Who is this?" reveals an ignorance of
Jesus that is widespread to-day. When Saul, on the way to Da-
mascus, fell terror-stricken to the earth, and heard the voice of
Jesus, he cried out, "Who art Thou, Lord?" The answer came
clear and definite, "I am Jesus whom- thou persecutest." It' was
enough. Saul's next trembling quegtion was, "Lord, what wilt
Thou have me to do?" So here the multitude answered, "This
is Jesus." It is our privilege to be part of a multitude to tell
the world, by our lives and by our words, "This is Jesus. Hear
ye Him."
    4. "Christ was following the Jewish custom for a royal entry.
The animal on which He rode was that ridden by the kings of
Israel, and prophecy had foretold that thus the Messiah should
come to His kingdom. No .sooner was He seated upon the colt
than a loud shout of triumph rent the air. The multitude hailed
Him as Messiah, their King. Jesus now accepted the homage
which He had never before permitted, and the disciples received
this as proof that their glad hopes were to be realized by seeing
Him established on the throne. The multitude were convinced
that the hour of their emancipation was at hand. In imagination
they saw the Roman armies driven from Jerusalem, and Israel
once more an independent nation. All were happy and excited ;
the people vied with one another in paying Him homage. They
could not display outward pomp and splendor, but they gave. Him
the worship of happy hearts. They were unable to present Him
with costly gifts, but they spread their outer garments as a carpet
in His path, and they also strewed the leafy branches of the olive
and the palm in the way. They could lead the triumphal proces-
sion with no royal standards, but they cut down the spreading
 palm boughs, Nature's emblem of victory, and waved them aloft
 with loud acclamations and hosannas."—"The Desire of Ages,"
 P. 570.
     5. This is not the first cleansing of the temple, though it is
 the only one recorded by Matthew. In John 2 : 13-16 is the ac-
 count of an earlier cleansing, which probably took place in the
 first year of Jesus' ministry. Though the two accounts are simi-
 lar, they should not be confused.
     6. "Never before in His earthly life had Jesus permitted such
 a demonstration. He clearly foresaw the result. It would bring
                               [ 351
Him to the cross. But it was His purpose thus publicly to present
Himself as the Redeemer. He desired to call attention to the
sacrifice that was to crown His mission to a fallen world. While
the people were assembling at Jerusalem to celebrate the Pass-
over, He, the antitypical Lamb, by a voluntary act set Himself
apart as an oblation. It would be needful for His church in all
succeeding ages to make His death for the sins of the world a
subject of deep thought and study. Every fact connected with
it should be verified beyond a doubt. It was necessary, then, that
the eyes of all people should now be directed to Him; the events
which preceded His great sacrifice must be such as to call at-
tention to the sacrifice itself. After such a demonstration as
that attending His entry into Jerusalem, all eyes would follow
His rapid progress to the final scene.
    "The events connected with this triumphal ride would be the
talk of every tongue, and would bring Jesus before every mind.
After His crucifixion, many would recall these events in their
connection with His trial and death. They would be led to search
the prophecies, and would be convinced that Jesus was the Mes-
siah ; and in all lands converts to the faith would be multiplied."—
"The Desire of Ages," p. 575.
    "This day, which seemed to the disciples the crowning day of
their lives, would have been shadowed with gloomy clouds had
they known that this scene of rejoicing was but a prelude to the
suffering and death of their Master. Although He had repeatedly
told them of His certain sacrifice, yet in the glad triumph of the
present they forgot His sorrowful words. and looked forward
to His prosperous reign on David's throne."—Id., pp. 571, 572.

                                  NOTES
  1. The two words, "He hungered," record an intensely human
experience of our Lord. Like men, He felt. hungry. Like men
                                    [ 37 ]
at times, He had not wherewith to satisfy His hunger, and was
obliged to search for food.
    One may wonder why Jesus should return to Jerusalem in
the morning hungry, since He had lodged at Bethany, the home
of Lazarus and his sisters, with whom He often stayed. But
seemingly He did not pass the night at their home, for "The De-
sire of Ages," page 58s, says, "The entire night Jesus spent in
prayer, and in the morning He came again to the temple."
    2. "The cursing of the fig tree was an acted parable. That
barren tree, flaunting its pretentious foliage in the very face of
Christ, was a symbol of the Jewish nation. The Saviour desired
to make plain to His disciples the cause and the certainty of
Israel's doom. For this purpose He invested the tree with moral
qualities, and made it the expositor of divine truth. The Jews
stood forth distinct from all other nations, professing allegiance
to God. They had been ,specially favored by Him, and they laid
claim to righteousness above every other people. But they were
corrupted by the love of the world and the greed of gain. They
boasted of their knowledge, but they were ignorant of the re-
quirements of God, and were full of hypocrisy. Like the barren
tree, they spread their pretentious branches aloft, luxuriant in
appearance, and beautiful to the eye, but they yielded 'nothing
but leaves.' The 'Jewish religion, with its magnificent temple, its
sacred, altars, its mitred priests and impressive ceremonies, was
indeed fair in outward appearance, but humility, love, and benevo-
lence were lacking."—"The Desire of Ages," pp, 582, 583.
    "The warning is for all time. Christ's act in cursing the tree
which His own power had created, stands as a warning to all
churches and to all Christians. . .     In the sentence pronounced
on the fig tree Christ demonstrates how hateful in His eyes is
this 'vain pretense. He declares that the open sinner is less
guilty than is he who professes to serve God, but who bears no
fruit to His- glory."—Id., p. 584.
    3. Here is an illustration of the kind of reasoning that has
respect to selfish interests only, that seeks to avoid a trap while
pursuing a wrong course. It is right to reason. Faculties of
mind* are given us for that use, but our reasoning is not to be
such as darkens and weakens faith. When we reason with the
Lord, let our reasoning not be Pharisaical, seeking to justify self,
but let it be rather that which seeks to determine how we and the
Lord can come together, and be fully reconciled.
    4. "Scribes, priests, and rulers were all silenced. Baffled and
disappointed, they stood with lowering brows, not daring to press
further questions upon Christ. By their cowardice and indecision
they had in a great measure forfeited the respect of the people,
who now stood by, amused to, see these proud, self-righteous men
defeated. . . . Many of those who had anxiously awaited the
result of the questioning of Jesus, were finally to become His
disciples, first drawn toward Him by His words on that eventful
                                38
day. . . . Many of those who witnessed the words and deeds of
Jesus in the temple, from that time enshrined Him in their hearts
as a prophet of God."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 594.
    5. "In this parable the father represents God, the vineyard the
church. By the two sons are represented two classes of people.
The son who refused to obey the command, saying, 'I will not,'
represented those who were living in open transgression, who
made no profession of piety, who openly refused to come under
the yoke of restraint and obedience which the law of ,God imposes.
But many of these afterward repented, and obeyed the call of
God. . . . In the son who said, 'I go, sir,' and went not, the
character of the Pharisees was revealed. Like this son, the Jew-
ish leaders wore impenitent and self-sufficient. The religious life
of the Jewish nation had become a pretense."—"Christ's Object
Lessons," pp. 275, 276.
    6. "Many to-day claim to obey the commandments of God,
but they have not, the love of God in their hearts to flow forth
to others. Christ calls them to unite with Him in His work for
the saving of the world, but they content themselves with saying,
`I go, sir.' They do not go. They do not cooperate with those
who are doing God's service. They are idlers. Like thv unfaith-
ful son, they make false promises to God."—Id., p. 279.
    "The son who for a time refused obedience to his father's
command was not condemned by Christ; and neither was he
commended. The class who act the part of the first son in re-
 fusing obedience deserve no credit for holding this position.
Their frankness is not to be regarded as a virtue. . . . The fact
 that a man is not a hypocrite does not make him any the less
 really a sinner. When the appeals of the Holy Spirit come to
 the heart, our only safety lies in responding to them without
 delay."—Id., pp. 280, AI.
