     B                     EGINNING with the
                             fourth quarter of 1926
                       and extending over a period
                       of nine months, the book of
                       Acts will form the basis
                       for study in the Sabbath
                       school; and as a help in
                       studying the lesson, the
                       book,

ACTS OF THE APOSTLES
by Mrs. E. G. White, will be indispensable. Prac-
tically every lesson note refers to this book. Quite
a full history of the early church and the apostolic
dispensation is set forth in this remarkably inter-
esting book. It is a most encouraging account of
the church at work, and a very strong help to
every believer.
    Secure a copy of the book before this interest
ing series of lessons begins, and study it closely
in connection with each lesson.

    The book contains 58 chapters, 63o pages,
printed on Bible paper. Cloth, $2.25 ; limp leather,
$3.25.

Lord's Supper.
    "There can not be doubt that the first discourse was spoken while
still at the supper table. It connects itself closely with that statement

that, whither' He was 'going, they could not come."—"Life and Times
of Jesus," Edersheitn, vol. 2, P. 513.

                               NOTES
    1. "There can not be doubt that the first discourse was spoken
while at the supper table. It connects itself closely with that state-
ment which had caused them [the disciples] so much sorrow and per-
plexity, that, whither He was going, they could not come; . . . the
two great elements in the discourse being, teaching and comfort"-
"Life and Times of Jesus," Edersheim, p. 513.
    "The disciples could not rejoice when they heard this. Fear fell
upon them. They pressed close about the Saviour. Their Master and
Lord, their beloved Teacher and Friend, He was dearer to them than
life. To Him they had looked for help in all their difficulties, for
comfort in their sorrows and disappointments. Now He was to leave
them, a lonely, dependent company. Dark were the forebodings that
filled their hearts."-"The Desire of Ages," p. 662.
    2. The object of Christ's departure was the opposite of what the
disciples feared. It did not mean a final separation. He was going .to
prepare a place for them, that He might Come again, and receive them
unto Himself. While He was building mansions for them, they were
to build characters after the divine similitude."-Id., p. 663.
                                [4]
    3. "By this Christ did not mean that the disciples' work would be
of a more exalted character than His, but that it would have greater
extent. He did not refer merely to miracle-working, but to all that
would take place under the working of the Holy Spirit."-14., P. 664.
    "The Saviour's promise to His disciples is a promise to 13 is church
to the end of time."—Id., p. 667. -
    4. "The Holy Spirit is Christ's representative, but divested of the
personality of humanity, and independent thereof. Cumbered with
humanity, Christ could not be in every place personally. Therefore it
was for their interest that He should go to the Father, and send the
Spirit to he His successor on earth. No one could then have any ad-
vantage because of his location or his personal contact with Christ.
By the Spirit the Saviour would be accessible to all. In this sense He
would be nearer to them than if He had not ascended on high."—
Id., p. 669.
    The Holy Spirit "is the only effectual teachei of divine truth.
Only when the truth is accompanied to the heart by the Spirit; will it
quicken the conscience or transform the life. . . . No amount of edu-
cation, no advantages, however great, can make one a channel of light
without the cooperation of the Spirit of God. The sowing of the
gospel seed will not be a success unless the seed is quickened into life
by the dew of heaven."—Id., pp. 671, 672.
    5. "Christ has promised the gift of the Holy Spirit to His church,
and the promise belongs to us as much as to the first disciples. • But
like every other promise, it is given on conditions. There are many
who believe and profess to claim,the Lord's promise; they talk about
Christ and about the Holy Spirit, yet receive no benefit. They do not
surrender the soul to be guided and controlled by the divine agencies.
We can not use the Holy Spirit. The Spirit is to use us. Through the
Spirit God works in His people 'to will and to do of His good
pleasure.' But many will not submit to this. They want to manage
theniselves. This is why they do not receive the heavenly gift. Only
to those who wait humbly upon God, who watch for His guidance and
grace, is the Spirit given. The power of God awaits their demand
and reception. This promised blessing, claimed by faith, brings all
other blessings in its train. It is given according to the riches of the
grace of Christ, and He is ready to supply every soul according to the
capacity to receive."—Id., p. 672.
    6. What better and more valuable gift could Jesus bestow upon
His children than His own blessed peace—that heavenly peace which
the world can neither give nor take away? It is of more value than
gold or silver or diamonds. He said, "My peace I give unto you."
Let us take it, and be at rest in Him, amid the troubles of life which
surround us. Matt.ii: 28, 29; Isa. 3o: 15; Phil. 4: 7.
    7. " 'Ilath nothing in Me.' There is in Me no principle or feeling
that accords with his, and nothing, therefore, by which he can pre-
vail."—Barn es' Ar.e.t
    8. "Before leaving the upper chamber, the Saviour led His disci-
ples in a song of praise. His voice was heard, not in the strains of
                                  [5]
some mournful lament, but in the joyful notes of the Passover
hallel [Psalm 117] : -
                    '0 praise the Lord, all ye nations;
                    Praise Him all ye people.
                    For His merciful kindness is great toward us,
                    And the truth of the Lord endureth forever.
                    Praise ye the Lord.'

   "After the hymn, they went out. Through the crowded streets
they made their way, passing out of the city gate toward the Mount of
Olives. Slowly they proceeded, each busy with his own thoughts."—
"The Desire of Ages," p. 672.


                               LESSON 2
           THE VINE AND THE BRANCHES
                              July 10, 1926
LESSON SCRIPTURE: John 15: 1-15.
MEMORY VERSE: "I am the vine, ye are the branches." John 15: 5.

   pp. 71-75.
PLACE: On the way from Jerusalem to the foot of Mount Olivet.

                       SETTING OF THE LESSON
   "Jesus and the disciples were on the way to Gethsemane, at the
foot of Mount Olivet, a retired spot which He had of ten visited for
meditation and prayer. The Saviour had been explaining to His dis-
ciples, His mission to the world, and the spiritual relation to Him
which they were to sustain. Now He illustrates the lesson. The
moon is shining bright, and reveals to Hjm a flourishing grapevine.
Drawing the attention of the disciples to it, He employs it as a
symbol."—"The Desire of Ages," P. 674.

                                 NOTES
    1. "The Jews had always regarded the vine as the most noble of
plants, and a type of all that was powerful, excellent, and fruitful.
Israel had been represented as a vine which God had planted in the
promised land. The Jews based their hope of salvation on the fact
of their connection with Israel. But Jesus says, I am the real Vine.
Think not that through a connection with Israel you may become par-
takers of the life of God, and inheriters of His promise. Through
 Me alone is spiritual life received."-"The Desire of Ages," p. 675.
 (See Isa. 5: 1-7.)
    "What a beautiful and appropriate type does the vine afford of the
 mystical body of Christ. . . . Christ is not the trunk, nor the
 branches, but the whole vine; they are members of His body, of His
 flesh, of His bones [Col. 2: 17, 10."-Peloubet's Notes.
     2. "'He taketh away.' Because their presence injures the other
 branches; and their remaining is of no benefit to themselves. As long
 as there is hope of their bearing fruit, they are permitted to remain,
 and are pruned and cared for. (See Luke 13:6-9.)"-Id.
     " 'Every branch that beareth fruit, He purgeth [pruneth] it, that
 it may bring forth more fruit.' From the chosen twelve who had fol-
 lowed Jesus, one as a withered branch was about to be taken away,
 the rest were to pais under the pruning-knife of bitter trial. Jesus
                                   [7
 with solemn tenderness explained the purpose of the husbandman.
 The pruning will cause pain, but it is the Father who applies the
 knife. He works with no wanton hand or indifferent heart. There
 are branches trailing upon the ground; these must be cut loose from
 the earthly supports to which their tendrils are fastening. They are
 to reach heavenward, and find their support in God. The excessive
 foliage that draws away the life current from the fruit, must be
 pruned off. The overgrowth must be cut out, to give room for the
 healing beams of the Sun of Righteousness. The husbandman prunes
 away the harmful growth, that the fruit may be richer and more
 abundant."—"The Desire of Ages," pp. 676, 677.
     3. "You are just as dependent upon Christ, in order to live a holy.
 life, as is the branch upon the parent stock for growth and fruitful-
 ness. Apart from Him you have no life. You have no power to
 resist temptation or to grow in grace and holiness. Abiding in Him,
 you may flourish. Drawing your life from Him, you will not wither
 nor be fruitless. You will be like a tree planted by the rivers of
 water.
     "Many have an idea that they must do some part of the work
 alone. They have trusted in Christ for the forgiveness of sin, but
 now they seek by their own efforts to live aright. But every such
 effort must fail. Jesus says, `Without Me ye can do nothing.' Our
 growth in grace, our joy, our usefulness,—all depend upon our union
 with Christ. , It is by communion with Him, daily, hourly,—by abiding
 in Him,—that we are to grow in grace."—"Steps to Christ," pp. 73, 74-
     4. Abiding in Christ is being as closely connected with Him as
 the branch is to the vine. The branch draws its life through the vine
 from its roots. This makes the branch so much a part of the vine as
 to partake of the same nature; in fact, it is but an extension of the
•vine itself. Remaining in that connection, the branch can bear only
 the fruit of the vine, which is the product of the life of the vine. TO
 have such close connection with Christ is to receive life from God
 through Him and to bear only that fruit which is the product of His
 life,—in short, to be the extension of Christ in humanity.
     5. To abide in Christ is to abide in His love; not simply,to accept
 forgiveness through His love, but to make His love our own, and
 live in it. This is the transforming power of Christ, which changes
 life's ambition, and directs the thoughts from a self-center to seek the
 upbuilding of the distressed and wretched. This is the fruit of the
 heavenly vine, which its connected branches must certainly bear.
     6. "`That My joy.' The same kind of joy that I [Jesus] have,
 and to be obtained in the same way. This joy is: (I) The joy of a
 free activity in doing right, like the joy of motion in health, like the
 song of a bird in the morning. (2) The joy of entire consecration
 and submission to God. (3) The joy of doing good, of self-denial for
 others. (4) The joy of perfect faith in a wise and loving God, com-
 mitting everything to His care. (5) Joy in the conscious love of God
 to us, communion and friendship with Him. (6) The joy of loving
 others. (7) The joy of seeing others saved. (8) The joy of victory.
  (9) In the. end, outward delights and pleasures to correspond with
 the inward joy."—Peloubet's Notes.

                                LESSON 3
  JESUS IN THE GARDEN OF GETHSEMANE
                               July 17, 1926
LESSON SCRIPTURE: Matt. 26: 36-56. -
PARALLEL SCRIPTURES: Mark 14: 32-52; Luke 22: 39-53; John 18: 1-12.
MEMORY VERSE: "Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation."
   Matt. 26: 41.
LESSON HELP: "The Desire of Ages," pp. 685-697.
PLACE: The Garden of Gethsemane.
PERSONS: Jesus and the eleven; Judas with the soldiers and the mob.

                        SETTING OF THE LESSON
   In the upper room, earlier in the evening, Jesus had eaten the
Passover supper with the disciples. He had instituted the ordinances
of humility and the Lord's Supper. He had pointed out Judas as the
one who should betray Him, and Judas had hastily left the room. On
the way from Jerusalem, Jesus had paused in the moonlight to give
His disciples the beautiful lesson of the vine and its branches, after-
ward offering the wonderful prayer recorded in John 17.
              "Toward the garden called Gethsemane
               We turn our faces and our steps to-day
               And wait in hushed and pitying grief apart,
               While Christ the world's sins takes upon His heart.
               For this He came—the Child of Bethlehem!
               To meet this hour He trod strange, toilsome roads,
               Misunderstood, hated, despised and feared;
               He takes at last the heaviest of all loads—
               To bear for others punishment and pain,
               And so redeem the world for God again."

                                NOTES
    1. Gethsemane was an inclosure at the foot of the Mount of Olives.
Here our Lord was accustomed to go with His disciples for prayer
and instruction.
    2. "Jesus had been earnestly conversing with His disciples and
instructing them; but as He neared Gethsemane, He became strangely
silent. . . . As they approached the garden, the disciples had marked
the change that came over their Master. Never before had they seen
Him so utterly sad and silent. As He proceeded, this strange sadness
deepened; yet they dared not question Him as to the cause. His form
swayed as if He were about to fall. Upon reaching the garden, the
disciples looked anxiously for His usual place of retirement, that
their Master might rest. Every step that He now took was with
labored effort. He groaned aloud, as if suffering under the pressure
                                   10
of a terrible burden. Twice His companions supported Him, or He
would have fallen to the earth."—"The Desire of Ages," pp. 685,686.
    3. The three disciples taken to the interior of the garden, to wit-
ness Christ's suffering, had been the chosen witnesses of His trans-
figuration. These alone were permitted to behold the power of Christ
in raising the ruler's daughter from the dead.
    4. "The human heart longs for sympathy in suffering. This long-
ing Christ felt to the very depths of His being. In the supreme agony
of His soul He came to His disciples with a yearning desire to hear
some words of comfort from those whom He had so often blessed
and comforted, and shielded in sorrow and distress. The One, who
had always had words of sympathy for them was now suffering super-
human agony, and He longed to know that they were praying for
Him and for themselves. How dark seemed the malignity of sin,
Terrible was the temptation to let the human race bear, the conse-
quences of its own guilt, while He stood innocent before God. If He
could only know that. His disciples understood and appreciated this,
He would be strengthened.
    "Rising with painful effort, He staggered to the place where He
had left His companions. But He ffindeth them asleep' Had He
found them praying, He would have been relieved."—"The Desire of
Ages," pp. 687, 688..
    5. Our Lord shrank from the awful agony before Him; not the
physical suffering, not the mocking, the shame, the anguish; but from
the awful sense of sin which hid te Father's face, and weighed upon
the Son of man like the agony of a lost soul. No wonder He prayed
that if possible the cup be removed. God did not condemn Him for
that. He does not condemn us when we pray for deliverance from
some awful trial. God pities and loves us still.; "for He knoweth our
frame; He remembereth that we are dust." He loved His Son no
less in dark Gethsemane than on the shining mount of transfiguration.
    6. "God suffered with His Son. Angels beheld the Saviour's
agony. They saw their Lord inclosed by legions of satanic forces,
 His nature weighed down with a shuddering, mysterious dread.
There was silence in heaven. No harp was touched. Could mortals
have viewed the amazement of the angelic host as in silent grief they
 watched the Father separating His beams of light, love, and glory
 from His beloved Son, they would better understand how offensive in
 His sight is sin."—"The Desire of Ages," p.'693.
    7. Judas could hardly have played the part of a betrayer better.
 His words of greeting mean literally, Rejoice, Rabbi, or, Be well,
 Rabbi. He had given the mob a sign: "Whomsoever I shall kiss."
 The record says he "kissed Him." But the latter word "kiss" is an
 intensive form, meaning he kissed Him fondly or heartily; "kissed
 Him much." A. R. V., margin.
    "Judas did not, however, believe that Christ would permit Himself
 to be arrested. . . . Since He had escaped so many snares, thought
 Judas, He certainly would not now allow Himself to be taken."—

                                NOTES
    1. John's record ( John 18: 13, 14) states that Jesus was taken first
to the home of Annas, the former high priest, a man much respected
by the Jews and still at the head of the officiating priestly family.
Later He was taken to the palace of Caiaphas, who was then high
priest. Caiaphas is identified as the one who had declared that it was
expedient that one man should die for the people. The occasion of
this utterance is found in John ii : 47-53, where it is said that the
expression did not originate with Caiaphas, but that as high priest, he
had been used of the Lord to utter a prophecy concerning Jesus'
death. Now he takes a leading part, by illegal and unbecoming means,
in bringing about the condemnation of Jesus.
    2. "After deserting their Master in the garden, two of the disciples
had ventured to follow, at a distance, the mob that had Jesus in
charge. These disciples were Peter and John. The priests recognized
John as a well-known disciple of Jesus, and admitted him to the hall,
hoping that as he witnessed the humiliation of his leader, he would
scorn the idea of such a one being the Son of God. John spoke in
favor of Peter, and gained an entrance for him also.
    "In the court a fire had been kindled; for it was the coldest hour
of the night, being just before the dawn. A company drew about the
fire, and Peter presumptuously toOkshis place with them. He did not
wish to be recognized as a disciple of Jesus. By mingling carelessly"
with the crowd, he hoped to be taken for one of those who had
brought Jesus to the hall."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 710.
    3. "Early in His ministry Christ had said, 'Destroy this temple,
and in three days I will raise it up.' In the figurative language of
prophecy, He had .thus foretold His own death and resurrection.
`He spake of the temple of His body.' These words the Jews had
understood in a literal sense, as referring to the temple at Jerusalem:
                                  f 13 1
Of all that Christ had said, the priests could find nothing to use
against Him save this. By misstating these words they hoped to
gain an advantage. The Romans had engaged in rebuilding and em-
bellishing the temple, and they took great pride in it; any contempt
shown to it would be sure to excite their indignation. Here Romans
and Jews, Pharisees and Sadducees, could meet; for all held the
temple in great veneration. On this point two witnesses were found
whose testimony was not so contradictory as that of the others had
been. One of them; who had been bribed to accuse Jesus, declared,
`This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build
it in three days.' Thus Christ's words were misstated. If they had
been reported exactly as He spoke them, they would not have secured
His condemnation even by the Sanhedrim."—Id., pp. 705, 706.
    4. When asked directly by the proper person o declare His iden-
tity, Jesus did not hesitate to answer. His words, "Thou hast said,"
are equivalent to an affirmative answer, as when He used the same
expression in answering Judas in verse 25.
    In answering Caiaphas, "Christ presented the reverse of the scene
then taking place. He, the Lord of life and glory, would be seated at
God's right hand. He Would be the judge of all the earth, and from
His decision there could be no appeal. Then every secret thing would
be set in the light of God's countenance, and judgment be passed
upon every man according to his deeds."—"The Desire of Ages,"
'. 707.
     5. According to Jewish law, as cited in the "Cambridge Bible for
Schools and Colleges," "the penalty for procuring false witnesses was
death." Other violations of the rules of Hebrew justice were, "the
trial by night, the sentence on the first day of trial, the trial of a
capital charge on the day before the Sabbath, the suborning of wit-
nesses, the direct interrogation by the high priest." Also, "the con-
demned was not to be executed on the day of his trial."
     6. "While the degrading oaths were fresh upon Peter's lips, and
the shrill crowing of the cock was still ringing in his ears, the Saviour
turned from the frowning judges, and looked full upon His poor
disciple. At the same time Peter's eyes were drawn to his Master.
In that gentle countenance he read deep pity and sorrow, but there
was no anger there.
    "The sight of that pale, suffering face, those quivering lips, that
look of compassion and forgiveness, pierced his heart like an arrow.
. . . He reflected with horror upon his own ingratitude, his false-
hood, his perjury. Once more he looked at his Master, and saw a
sacrilegious hand raised to smite Him in the face. Unable longer to
endure the scene, he rushed, heartbroken, from the hall.
    "He pressed on in solitude and darkness, he knew not and cared
not whither. At last he found himself in Gethsemane.. . . On the
very spot where Jesus had poured out His soul in agony to His
Father, Peter fell upon his face, and wished that he might die. It was
in sleeping when Jesus bade him watch and pray that Peter had pre-
pared the way for his great sin."—"The Desire of Ages," pp. 712, 713.

                        SETTING OF THE LESSON
   The beginning of this lesson seems to have been a formal meeting

The purpose of this session in the morning was no doubt that of pass-
ing the legal sentence, and approving the acts of the previous night.

17. What prophecy was thus fulfilled? Verses 9, 10.
                                 NOTES
    1. The charge against Christ before the Sanhedrin, or Jewish
national council, hastily assembled at the house of Caiaphas, the high
priest, was that of blasphemy, because, as they said, He, being a man,
made Himself God. But blasphemy against the God of the Hebrews
was not a crime under Roman law ; therefore, when Jesus was
brought before Pilate, He was charged with making Himself a king,
forbidding to pay tribute, and speaking against Caesar.
     2. "After condemning Jesus, the council of the Sanhedrin had
come to Pilate to have the sentence confirmed and executed. . . .
When the Saviour was brought into the judgment hall, Pilate looked
upon Him with no friendly eyes. The Roman governor had been
called from his bedchamber in haste."-"The Desire of Ages," p. 723.
     3. Jesus' answer, "Thou sayest," is similar to that used before
Caiaphas when urged to say whether He was the Son of God or not.
 (See Matt. 26: 64.) It is equivalent to an affirmative answer. Jesus
could not deny that He was the Son of God or King of the Jews.
     4. "Pilate expected an answer. He knew the substantial falsehood
of both charges, but he would have them met by a reference to well-
known facts, that he might have ostensible grounds for requital,
which from first to last it was evidently his wish to pronounce. But
our Lord was silent."--Dean Mansel.
     5. Several things show that the repentance of Judas was not of
the genuine kind that brings remission of sins : (i) It did not come
till be saw that Jesus was condemned-it was based on consequences,
not on the sinfulness of betrayal. (2) If the repentance had been of
the right kind, he would not have taken his own life. (3) The word
"repented" used here is not the usual one for repentance of sin, but
rather,,denotes a growing anxiety over a thing after it is dOne, and
could very properly be rendered here "filled with regret or remorse."
                                  [ 16
    6. "Judas reasoned that if Jesus was to be crucified, the event must
come to pass. His own act in betraying the Saviour would not change
the result. .    . Judas did not, however, believe that Christ would
permit Himself to be arrested. . . . Judas beheld the captors of
Christ, acting upon his words, bind Him firmly. In amazement he
saw that the Saviour suffered Himself to be led away.. Anxiously he
followed Him from the garden to the trial before the Jewish rulers.
At every movement he looked for Him to surprise His enemies, by
appearing before them as the Son of God, and setting at naught all
their plots and power. But as hour after hour went by, and Jesus
submitted to all the abuse heaped upon Him, a terrible fear came to
the traitor that he had sold his Master to His death.
   "As the trial drew to a close, Judas could endure the torture of his
guilty conscience no longer. Suddenly a hoarse voice rang through
the hall, sending a thrill of terror to all hearts : He is innocent;
spare Him, 0 Caiaphas!
   "The tall form of Judas was now seen pressing through the
startled throng. His face was pale and haggard, and great drops of
sweat stood on his forehead. Rushing to the throne of judgment, he
threw down before the high priest the pieces of silver that had been
the price of his Lord's betrayal. Eagerly grasping the robe of
Caiaphas, he implored him to release Jesus, declaring that He had
done nothing worthy of death. Caiaphas angrily shook him off, but
was confused, and knew not what to say. The perfidy of the priests
was revealed. It was evident that they had bribed the disciple to be-
tray his Master."—"The Desire of Ages," pp. 720-722.
   7. This is a striking example of straining at a gnat and swallowing
a camel. Matt. 23: 24. It was a matter for serious counsel what to do
with this "tainted" money,—tainted by themselves in taking it out of
the Lord's treasury and using it to bribe the betrayer of Jesus. They
were mindful of the law in not putting the price of bribery back into
the treasury, but they ignored the law in the murder of the innocent
Son of God.

   Jesus had been seized in the Garden of Gethsemane, tak6n before
Annas, thence to Caiaphas, the high priest; and had been condemned
to death bythe Sanhedrin, the highest Jewish authority. Having no
authority to execute the death sentence, the Jews brought Him be-
fore Pilate, the Roman governor, and sought to have him put Jesus
to death.

17. What was -Pilate's final decision regarding Jesus? Verse 26.
                              NOTES
    1. Three charges against Jesus were made before Pilate by the •
Jews, and these may be summed up as follows : (I) sedition, inciting
revolution; (2) "forbidding to give tribute to Cxsar," the Roman
emperor; (3) claiming to be the Son of God and the king of the Jews.
    2. The Herod here mentioned is Herod Antipas, son of Herod the
Great. He waA ruler- of Galilee and Perea. He was a wicked man,
and one of his greatest crimes was the beheading of John the Bap-
tist. At the time of the events of this lesson, he was in Jerusalem,
having come -to attend the Passover.
    3. "The Roman authorities at this time held a prisoner named
Barabbas, who was under sentence of death. This man had claimed
to be the Messiah. He claimed authority to establish a different
order of things, to set the world right. Under satanic delusion he
claimed that whatever he could obtain by theft and robbery was his
own. He had done wonderful things through satanic agencies, he
had gained a following among the people, and had excited sedition
against the Roman government. Under cover of religious enthusiasm
he was a- hardened and desperate villain, bent on rebellion and
cruelty."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 733.
 • 4. "By giving the people a choice between this man and the inno-
cent Saviour, Pilate thought to arouse them to a sense of justice.
He hoped to gain their sympathy for Jesus in opposition to the priests
and rulers. So, turning to the crowd, he said with great earnestness,
`Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is
called Christ?' "—Ibid.
    5. "Pilate was not left to act blindly. A message' from God
warned him from the deed he was about to commit. In answer to
Christ's prayer, the wife of Pilate had been visited by an angel from
heaven, and in a dream she had beheld the Saviour and conversed
with Him. Pilate's wife was not a Jew, but as she looked upon
Jesus in her dream, she had no doubt of His character or mission."—
Id.. p. 732.
    After describing how there passed before her in the dream the
scenes in the judgment hall, the crucifixion, and the second coming of
Christ in glory, the record continues : "With a cry of horror she
awoke, and at once wrote to Pilate words of warning. While Pilate,
                                 [ 19 ]
was hesitating as to what he should do, a messenger pressed through
the crowd, and handed him the letter from his wife, which read,—
`Have thou nothing to do with that just man; for I have suffered
many things this day in a dream because of Him.' "—Ibid.
    6. "Like the bellowing of wild beasts came the answer of the mob,
Release unto tis Barabbas. Louder and louder swelled the cry,
Barabbas! Barabbas! Thinking that the people had not understood
his question, Pilate asked, Will ye that I release unto you the King
of the Jews?' But they cried out again, 'Away with this man, and
release unto us Barabbas !"What shall I do then with Jesus which is
called Christ?' Pilate asked. Again the surging multitude roared
like demons. Demons themselves, in human form, were in the crowd,
and what could be expected but the answer, 'Let Him be crucified'?"—
Id., p. 733.
   7. "The Jews were accustomed to wash their hands when they
wished to show that they were innocent of a crime committed by
others. (See Deut. 21: 6; Ps. 26: 6.) Pilate, in doing this, meant to
denote that they were guilty of His death, but that he was innocent."
—Barnes' NMea-:
   No one can lay the responsibility of his actions upon others.
Pilate could not wash his hands of the evil deed.

                                   NOTES

    1. "Into the common hall," or the pretOrium; or governor's house.
(See margin.) The whole band, or cohort, .gathered together to
mock Jesus. He had endured six trials, , before Annas, before
Caiaphas and the Sanhedrin at night, before the same body in the
morning, before. Pilate, before Herod, and again before Pilate. At
last, to appease the mob, sentence was given agairist Him. Yet, after
all this, Pilate put forth one more effort to save the Prisoner whom
he feared, and knew to be innocent.
    2. Cyrene was in North Africa, a province of Libya. That part
is now known as Tunis. A large colony of Jews had settled there
centuries before; and there ware large numbers there. still.
                                 [ 21 1
    "As Jesus passed the gate of Pilate's court, the cross which had
been prepared for Barabbas was laid upon His bruised and bleeding
shoulders. . . . He fell fainting beneath the burden. . . . At this
time a stranger, Simon a Cyrenian, coming in from the country, meets
the throng. He hears the taunts and ribaldry of the crowd; he hears
the words contemptuously repeated, Make way for the King of the
Jews. He stops in astonishment at the scene ; and as he expresses his
compassion, they seize him and place the cross upon his shoulders.
    "Simon had heard of Jesus. His sons were believers in the
Saviour, but he himself was not a disciple. The bearing of the cross
to Calvary was a blessing to Simon, and he was ever after grateful
 for this providence. It led him to take upon hitriself the cross of
Christ from choice, and ever cheerfully stand beneath its burden."—
"The Desire of Ages," pp. 741, 742.
    3. "Two companions of Barabbas were to suffer death at the
same time with Jesus, and upon them also crosses were placed."—
Id., P. 741.
    4. " Tor if they do these things in a green tree, what shall.be done
in the dry?' By the green tree, Jesus represented Himself, the inno-
cent Redeemer. God suffered His wrath against transgression to fall
on His beloved Son. Jesus was to be crucified for the sins Of men.
What suffering, then, would the sinner bear who continued in sin?
All the impenitent and unbelieving would know a sorrow and misery
that language would fail to express."—Id., P. 743.
    "For, if Israel had put such flame to its 'green tree,' how terribly
would the divine judgment burn among the dry wood of an apostate
and rebellious people, that had so delivered up its divine King, and
pronounced sentence upon itself by pronouncing k upon Him !"—
"Life and Times of Jesus,"_Edersheim, vol. 2, p_588.
    5. "It was a merciful Jewish practice to give—tE:those led to exe-
cution a draught of strong wine mixed with myrrh, so as to deaden
consciousness. This charitable office was performed at the cost of, if
not by, an association of women in Jerusalem. That draught was of-
fered to Jesus when He reached Golgotha. But having tasted it, and
ascertained its character and object, He would not drink it."—
PP. 589, 590.
    6. "The enemies of Jesus vented their rage upon Him as He hung
upon the cross. Priests, rulers, and scribes joined with the mob in
mocking the dying Saviour. At the baptism and at the transfigura-
tion the voice of God had been heard proclaiming Christ as His Son.
Again, just before Christ's betrayal, the Father had spoken, witnessing
to His divinity. But now the voice from heaven was silent. No
testimony in Christ's favor was heard. Alone He suffered abuse and
mockery from wicked men."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 746.
    7. "In their mockery of the Saviour, the men who professed to be
the expounders of prophecy were repeating the very words which in-
spiration had foretold they would utter upon this occasion. Yet in
their blindness they did not see that they were fulfilling the prophecy.
Those who in derision uttered the words, 'He trusted in God ; let
Him deliver Him now, if He will have Him ; for He said, I am the
                                  [22 ]
Son of God,' little thought that their testimony would sound down
the ages. But although spoken in mockery, these words led men to
search the Scriptures as they had never done before. Wise men
heard, searched, pondered, and prayed. There were those who never
rested until, by comparing scripture with scripture, they saw the
meaning of Christ's mission. Never before was there such a general
knowledge of Jesus as when He hung upon the cross. Into the hearts
of many who beheld the crucifixion scene; and who heard Christ's
words, the light of truth was shining."—Id., P. 749.

                                 NOTES
    1. "To Jesus          agony  on the cross there came one gleam of
comfort. It was the prayer .of the penitent thief. Both the men who
were crucified with Jesus had at first railed upon Him ; and one
under his suffering, only became more desperate and defiant. But
not so with his companion. This man was not a hardened criminal;
he had been led astray by evil associations, but he was less guilty than
many of those Who stood beside the cross reviling the Saviour. He
had seen and heard Jesus, and had been convicted by His teaching,
but he had been turned away from Him by the priests and rulers.
Seeking to stifle conviction; he had plunged deeper and deeper into sin,
until he was arrested, tried as a criminal, and condemned to die on
the cross. . . .
    "When condemned for his, crime, the thief had become hopeless
and despairing; but strange, tender thoughts now spring up. He calls
10. mind all he has 'heard of Jesus, how He has healed the sick and
pardoned sin. He has heard the words of those who believed in
Jesus and followed Him• weeping. He has seen and read the title
above the Saviour's head. He has heard the passers-by repeat it, some
with grieved, quivering lips, others with jesting and mockery. The
Holy Spirit illuminates his mind, and little by little the chain of evi-
dence is joined together. In Jesus, bruised, mocked, and hanging
                                  [ 24]
upon the cross, he sees the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of
the world. Hope is mingled with anguish in his voice as the helpless,
dying soul casts himself upon a dying Saviour."—"The Desire of
Ages," pp. 749, 750.
    2. "I say unto thee to-day, Thou shalt be with Me in Paradise.
Christ did not promise that the thief should be with Him in Paradise
that day. He Himself did not go that day to Paradise. He slept in..
the tomb, and on the morning of the resurrection He said, 'I am not
yet ascended to My Father.' But on the day of the crucifixion, the
day of apparent defeat and darkness, the promise was given. 'To-
day,' while dying upon the cross as a malefactor, Christ assures the
poor sinner, 'Thou shalt be with Me in Paradise.' "—Id.,-p. 751.
    "It is well known that the punctuation of the Bible is not the work
of the inspired writers. Indeed, punctuation is but a modern art, the
comma in its present form having been invented in 1490 by a printer
of Venice. . . . In Luke 23: 43, place the comma after 'to-day,' and
give the direct instead of the inverted form of the verb; and the text
 reads, 'Verily I say unto thee to-day, Thou shalt be with Me in
 Paradise.' There is now no lack of harmony between this text and
Christ's later statement, that He had not yet ascended to, His: Father."
—Id., Appendix.
   3. "0 pitiful, loving Saviour; amid all His physical pain and
mental anguish; He had a thoughtful care for His mother.. He had
no money with which to provide for her comfort; but He was en-
shrined in the heart of John, and He gave His mother to him as a
precious legacy. Thus He provided for her that which she most
needed,—the tender r sympathy of one who loved her because she
loved Jesus. And in receiving her as a sacred trust, John was re-
ceiving a great blessing. She, was a constant reminder of his beloved
Master."—Id., p. 752.
   4. "In that thick darkness God's presence was hidden. He makes
darkness His pavilion, and conceals His glory from human eyes. God
and His holy angels were beside the cross. The Father was with His
Son. Yet His presence was, not revealed. Had His glory flashed
forth from the cloud, every human beholder would have been de-
stroyed. And in that dreadful hour, Christ was not to be comforted
with the Father's presence. He trod the winepress alone, and of the
people there was none with Him.
   "In the thick darkness, God veiled the last human agony of His
Son. All who had seen Christ in His suffering had been convicted
of His divinity. That face, once beheld by hunianity, was never for-
gotten. As the face of Cain expressed his guilt as a murderer, so the
face of Christ revealed innocence, serenity,lienevolence,—the image
of God. But His accusers would not give heed to the signet of
heaven. Through long hours of agony, Christ had been. gazed 'upon
by the jeering multitude. Now. He was mercifully •hidden by• the
mantle of God."—Id., pp. 753? 754•
    5. The seven sayings of Jesus on the cross form a remarkable
index to the Christ-life, and a striking epitome' of Christian expe-
rience :

    6. "Never before had the earth witnessed such a scene. The mul-
titude stood paralyzed, and with bated breath gazed upon the Saviour.
Again darkness settled upon the earth, and a hoarse rumbling, like
heavy thunder, was heard. There was a violent earthquake. The
people were shaken together in heaps. The wildest confusion and
consternation ensued. In the' surrounding mountains, rocks were
rent asunder, and went crashing down into the plains. Sepulchers
were broken open, and the dead were cast out of their tombS. Crea-
tion seemed to be shivering to atoms. Priests, rulers, soldiers, exe-
cutioners, and . people, mute with terror, lay prostrate upon the
ground."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 756.

                     SETTING OF THE LESSON
   Jesus was crucified in the morning on Friday. He died in the
middle of the afternoon. As it was against 'the Jewish law for
criminals to, remain on the cross on the Sabbath, preparations were
hastened for the removal of the bodies. It was customary to bury
those who were executed, in a plot of ground set apart for that pur-
pose. The disciples were greatly troubled, for they did not want
Jesus buried in a place of dishonor. They lingered at the cross after
the death of Jesus, not knowing what to do.

                                 NOTES
    1. "With the death of Christ the hopes of His disciples perished.
They looked upon His closed eyelids and drooping head, His hair
matted with blood, His pierced hands and feet, and .their anguish was
indescribable. Until the last they had not believed that He would die;
they could hardly believe that He was really dead. Overwhelmed
with sorrow, they did not recall His words foretelling this very scene.
Nothing that He had said, now gave them comfort. They saw only
the cross and its bleeding victim. The future seemed dark with
despair. Their faith in Jesus had perished; but never had they, loved
their Lord as now. Never before had they so felt His worth, and
their need of His presence."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 772.
    2. Joseph was a "counselor," which probably means that he was
a member of the great council of the Sanhedrin. Luke 23: 5o, 51.
Probably no one but a member of that court would have dared ask
such a favor of Pilate, who alone could give permission for the re-
moval of the body. Joseph had secretly believed in Christ for some
time, having but one friend to whom he had divulged his feelings,
namely, Nicodemus. Together they had decided to brave indignation,
and give the Saviour an honorable burial.
    3. At this point, John introduces Nicodemus, who "brought a mix-
ture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight,". and adds,
"Then took they [Joseph and Nicodemus] the body of Jesus, and
wound it in linen clothes with the spice's." John 19 39, 40. Thus did
two rich men contribute to the fulfillment of Isaiah 53 : 9.
                                                                  night
                 at first came to Jesus by night; but it was a night
which
which brought light to his soul. He next dared to raise his voice be-
fore the Sanhedrin, demanding fair treatment of Jesus. "both our
law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he dQeth?"
he said. Now he comes forward in this time of peril and utter need,
to identify himself with the Crucified One, who was lifted up.
    4. How singular that these murderers of Jesus should remember
His repeated prediction that He should rise again inithree days, while
His own disciples, according to the testimony of one 'of the most de-
voted of them, "knew not the scripture, that He must rise again"
(John zo 9), but were found mourning and weeping when Mary
Magdalene came to announce the resurrection, and even then "be-
lieved not." Mark 16 : 9-11.
    The perfidy and hypocrisy of the priests and rulers who con-
demned Jesus is shown in many things, and in none more than in the
fact that while they pretended to believe false witnesses who accused
Jesus of desiring to destroy the temple, and build it again in three
days, yet they understood so well Christ's prediction concerning. His
resurrection on the third day that they obtained Pilate's consent, and
sealed the tomb with the Roman seal, placing a strong soldier guard
about it.
    5. "The priests gave directions for securing the sepulcher. A great
stone had been placed before the opening. Across this stone they
placed cords, securing the ends to the solid rock, and sealing them
with the Roman seal. The stone could not be moved without break-
                                  ( 28 3
ing the seal. A guard of one hundred soldiers was then stationed
around the sepulcher to prevent it from being tampered with. The
priests did all they could to keep Christ's body where it had been
laid. He was sealed as securely in His tomb as if He were to remain
there through all time."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 778.,
    6. Among these women were:
    (I) Mary Magdalene, out of whom Mark and Luke say Jesus had
cast seven devils, who is usually mentioned first in each of the Gospels.,
(John only excepted), who was first at the sepulcher on the morning
of the resurrection, first to discover that the tomb was empty, first to
be addressed by Jesus as He revealed to her His identity, first to carry
to the disciples, "as they mourned and wept," the joyful news that
Jesus had risen.
    (2) Mary the mother of James and Joses, generally accepted as
identical with the one whom John calls "Mary the wife of Cleophas,"
of whom but little is known.
    (3) "The mother of Zebedee's children," whose name is given by
 Mark as Salome, and who .was very probably identical with the
woman mentioned in John 19 : 25 as "His mother's sister," that is,
sister to Mary, the mother of Jesus. In "The Desire of Ages," page
548, it is said that she "was a follower of Christ, and had ministered
to Him freely of her substance.' If it be true that Jesus' mother and
John's mother were sisters, it affords an added reason why Jesus
commended His mother to John's care at the cross, and why John's
mother made the special request for her sons to sit next to Jesus in
 His kingdom.
    7. "Now, priests and rulers, where is the power of your guard?—
 Brave soldiers that have never been afraid of human power, are now
as captives taken without sword or spear. The face they look upon
 is not the face of mortal warrior ; it is the face of_ the mightiest of
 the Lord's host. This messenger is he- who fills the position from
 which Satan fell. It is he who on the hills of Bethlehem proclaimed
 Christ's birth. The earth trembles at his approach, the hosts of dark-
 ness flee, and as he rolls away the stone, heaven seems to come down
 to the earth. The soldiers see him removing the stone as he would
 a pebble, and hear him cry, Son of God, come forth; Thy Father calls
 Thee. They see Jesus come forth from the grave, and hear Him
 proclaim over the rent sepulcher, 'I am the resurrection and the life.' "

       Very early in the morning on the first day of the week, Jesus came
    forth from the tomb, according to His promise that He would rise the
    third day. The sealing of the tomb, the soldier guard, the power of
    Satan,-none of these had been able to prevent Christ's glorious resur-
    rection.

                                 NOTES
   1. "The women had not all come to the tomb from the same di-
rection. Mary Magdalene was the first to reach the place ; and upon
seeing that the stone was removed, she hurried away to tell the
disciples. Meanwhile the other women came up."—"The Desire of
Ages," p. 788.
    2. "He goeth before you." It is not in past traditions, however
holy ; it is not in past conceptions of truth, however much they may
have been blessed; it is not in dead creeds written by men, however
good; it is not in plans once successful, that our success lies; it is in
following the present living Christ in His work to-day, out into the
great fields where the need lies.
    "Tell His disciples and Peter." Poor, discouraged, repentant
Peter! He is not forgotten by his Lord. Now, when risen from the
dead, Jesus remembers His sorrowing disciple, and fearing he will in
his despondency conclude that the Master does not care for him, He
asks that Peter especially be told He is risen from the dead. We have
the same loving, compassionate Saviour to-day.
    3. "It was Christ Himself who had placed those grave clothes
with such care. When the mighty angel came down to the tomb, he
was joined by another, who with his company had been keeping guard
over the Lord's body. As the angel from heaven rolled away the
stone, the other entered the tomb, and unbound the wrappings front
                                   31
the body of Jesus. But it was the Saviour's hand that folded each,
and laid it in its place. In His sight who guides alike the star and the
atom, there is nothing unimportant. Order and perfection are seen
in all His work."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 789.
    4. The individual characteristics of Peter and John are seen in
their visit to the tomb. Peter, rash and impetuous, went into the
tomb as soon as he reached it. John, more cautious and deliberate,
first looked in, going in later.
    5. After visiting the sepulcher, the disciples went to their home.
Not so with Mary Magdalene. She .could not 'go home. She had
lost her Lord, and could not rest till she had found Him. She re-
mained by the sepulcher to weep. Often to such anxious souls the
Lord appears. While she wept, her Lord appeared with words of
comfort. She was the first to greet Him after He had, risen from the
dead.
    6. "At sight of the angels and the glorified Saviour the Roman
guard had fainted and become as dead men. When the heavenly
train was hidden from their view, they arose to their feet, and as
quickly as their trembling limbs could carry them, made their way
to the gate of the garden. Staggering like drunken men, they hur-
ried on to the city, telling those whom they met the wonderful news.
They, were making their way to Pilate, but their report had been
carried to the Jewish authorities, and the chief priests and rulers
sent for them to be brought first into their presence. A strange ap-
pearance those soldiers presented. Trembling with fear, their faces
colorless, they bore testimony to the resurrection of Christ. The
soldiers told all, just as they had seen it; they had not had time to
think or speak anything but the truth. With painful utterance they
said, It was the Son of God who was crucified; we have heard an
angel proclaiming Him as the Majesty of heaven, the King of Glory.
    "The faces of the prists were as those of the dead. Caiaphas
tried to speak. His lips moved, but they uttered no sound. The
soldiers were about to leave the council room, when a voice stayed
them. Caiaphas had at last found speech. Wait, wait, he 'said. Tell
no one the things you have seen.
    "A lying report was then given to the soldiers. 'Say ye,' said the
priests, 'His disciples came by night, and stole Him away while we
slept.' "—"The Desire of Ages," pp. 781', 782.
    7. "The soldiers were horrified at the thought of bringing upon
themselves the charge of sleeping at their post. This was an offense
punishable with death. Should they bear false witness, deceiving the
people, and placing their own lives in peril? Had they not kept their
weary watch with sleepless vigilance? How could they stand the
trial, even for the sake of money, if they perjured themselves?
    "In order to silence the testimony they feared, the priests prom-
ised to secure the safety of the giiard, saying that Pilate would not
desire to have such a report circulated any more than they did. The
Roman soldiers sold their integrity to the Jews for money. They
came in before the priests burdened with a most startling message
of truth; they went out with a burden of money, and on their tongues
a lying report which had been framed for them by the priests."—

    The eleven disciples seem to be the last to accept the truth that
Jesus had risen from the dead. The Roman soldiers believed, the-
priests knew the truth of the matter, and Mary and the other women.
testified that they had seen Him. To the eleven, these things seemed.
as "idle tales," and they "believed not."

                                NOTES
    1. The name "Emmaus" means "warm springs." This was a little
town about eight miles from Jerusalem. Its location is not now iden-
tified with certainty. Doubtless the disciples left Jerusalem in the
afternoon, for the day was far spent when they reached Emmaus.
These two disciples were not of the twelve, but of "the rest."
Luke 24: 9.
    2. "Their eyes were holden." They were so absorbed in the con-
templation of their disappointed hopes, and so sad and troubled at
the perplexing tidings they had received concerning the empty tomb
and the absent body of Jesus, that they did not observe the Stranger
very closely. So in our perplexity and trials the blessed Master is
near to -us, but our eyes are often holden through unbelief, and we
do not see Him.
    3. They rehearsed the events of the last three days, the betrayal
and trials of Jesus, their own disappointment, the visit to the
                                 [ 34 ]
sepulcher, the half-believed story of His resurrection. Note that of
the three days in which all these things happened, 'this is i`the third
day," thus showing how elastic is the term over which many are led
into controversy. The three days so often mentioned in connection
with the Saviour's sufferings include parts of two days and the whole
of one.
     "Strange that the disciples did not remember Christ's words, and
realize that He had foretold the events which had come to pass. They
did not realize that the last part of His disclosure would be just as
verily fulfilled as the first part, that the third day He would rise
again. This was the part they should have remembered."—"The
Desire of Ages,' p. 796.
     4. The word "fools" as here used means "dull," or as Christ ex-
plains, "slow" to see and understand.
     5. Jesus might easily have convinced the disciples of His resurrec-
tion by showing them His wounded hands, or revealing His power in
 some supernatural way. But He desired that their belief in Him
should rest, not on sight, or some miraculous revelation, but on the
 Scriptures. In like manner He desires that we believe in Him, not
 because We see some miracles performed, but on the plain statement
of the Scriptures themselves.
     6. Do we desire the Lord's presence sufficiently to urge that He
 abide with us? We often urge the coming or tarrying of a friend.
 Would ,not Christ be oftener our companion in the common things
 of life if we but urged or "constrained" Him more?
      7. "The simple ,evening meal of bread is soon prepared. It is
 placed before the guest, who has taken His seat at the head of the
 table. Now He puts forth His hands to bless the food. The disciples
 start back in astonishment. Their companion spreads forth His hands
 in exactly the same way as their Master used to do. They look again,
 and lo, they see in His hands the print of nails. Both exclaim at
 once, It is the Lord Jesus! He has risen from the dead! They rise
 to cast themselves at His feet and worship Him, but He has vanished
 out of their sight."—"The Desire of Ages," p. 800.
      8. "The travelers find all in surprised excitement. The voices of
 those in the room break out into thanksgiving and praise, saying, The
 Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.' Then the two
 travelers, panting with -the haste with which they have made their
 journey, tell the wondrous story of how Jesus has appeared to them.
 They have just ended, and some are saying that they can not believe
 it, for it is too good to be true, when behold, another person stands
 before them. Every eye is fastened upon the stranger. No one has
 knocked for entrance. No footstep has been heard. The disciples are
 startled, and wonder what it means. Then they hear a voice which
  is no other than the voice of their Master. Clear and distinct the
  words fall from His lips, 'Peace be unto you.' "—Id., pp. 802, 803.
      9. "Many who are given to doubt excuse themselves by saying
  that if they had the evidence which Thomas had from his companions,
  they would believe. They do not realize that they have not only that
  evidence. but much more. Many who, like Thomas, wait for all
  cause of doubt to be removed, will never realize their desire. They
                                  E 35 3
gradually become confirmed in unbelief. Those who educate them-
selves to look on the dark side, and murmur and complain, know note
what they do. They are sowing the seeds of doubt, and they will
have a harvest of doubt to reap. At a time when faith and confi-
dence are most essential, many will thus find themselves powerless
to hope and believe."—Id., pp. 807, 808.

                                  NOTES
      1. "Jesus had appointed to meet His disciples in Galilee; and soon
  after the Passover week was ended, they bent their steps thither.
  Their absence from Jerusalem during the feast, would have been
  interpreted as disaffection and heresy, therefore they remained till
  its close; but this over, they gladly turned homeward to meet the
  Saviour as - He had directed.
       "Seven of the disciples were in company. They were clad in the
  humble garb of fishermen; they were poor in worldly goods, but rich
                                   [37]
in the knowledge and practice of the truth, which in the sight of
Heaven gave them the highest rank as teachers."—"The Desire of
Ages," p. 800.
   2. The Sea of Galilee was also known as the Sea of Tiberias.
   3. This is another illustration of the fact that in obeying the Lord's
commands there follows a reward which meets the demand of the
hour. When the Lord said to the nobleman, "Go thy way; thy son
liveth," on returning home he found his heart's desire. When Jesus,
out on the deep sea, said to Peter, "Come," obedience to the com-
mand provided power with which to walk on the water. The law of
friendship with Christ is still the same. John 15: 14. To obey im-
plicitly is the first step into the Lord's confidence, and toward final
reward.
    4. This question was to refresh Peter's mind regarding what he
had said on the night of the betrayal,—that, although all the other
disciples should deny the Lord, he never would; that he loved Him
enough to go to prison or to death with Him, even though the other
disciples should forsake Him. So the Lord reminds us frequently, •
after our failures, of our boasted love, not by direct reference to
the boasts made, but by some other test which will cause us to reflect
on the failures.
   5. "While Christ and the disciples were eating together by the
seaside, the Saviour said to Peter, 'Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou
Me more than these?' referring to his brethren. Peter had once de-
clared, 'Though all men shall be offended because of Thee, yet will I
never be offended.' But he now put a truer estimate upon himself.
`Yea, Lord,' he said, 'Thou knowest that I love Thee.' There is no
vehement assurance that his love is greater than that of his brethren.
He does not express his own opinion of his devotion. To Him who
can read all the motives of the heart he appeals to judge as to his
sincerity,—`Thou knowest that I love Thee.' And Jesus bids him,
`Feed My lambs.'
   "Again Jesus applied the test to Peter, repeating His former
words: 'Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou Me?' This time He did
not ask Peter whether he loved Him better than did his brethren.
The second response was like the first, free from extravagant assur-
ance : Tea, Lord; Thou knowest that I love Thee.' Jesus said to
him, 'Feed My sheep.' Once more the Saviour put the trying ques-
tion: 'Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou Me?' Peter was grieved; he
thought that Jesus doubted his love. He knew that his Lord had
cause to distrust him, and with an aching heart he answered, 'Lord,
Thou knowest all things; Thou knowest that I love Thee.' Again
Jesus said to him, 'Feed My sheep.'
   "Three times Peter had openly denied his Lord, and three times
Jesus drew from him the assurance of his love and loyalty, pressing
home that pointed question, like a barbed arrow to his wounded heart.
Before the assembled disciples Jesus revealed the depth of Peter's re-
pentance, and showed how thoroughly humbled was the once boasting •
disciple."—"The Desire of Ages," pp. 811, 812.
    6. This change is remarkable because it shows 'that Christ not
only distinguished between the older and younger members of His
                                     38
 body, but that He in this case called attention to the younger ones
.first,_ indicating that they should find a prominent place in the labors
 of those who work for the Master. It is also remarkable that the
 word "feed," used in verses 16 and 17, comes from two different
 originals. The one in verse 17 means to give pasture, and the other
 conveys the sense of tending as a shepherd. Not only, then, were
 the individual members of the flock to be fed, but also tended, and
 cared for in every need.
     7. Peter in his old age "should stretch forth his hands in un-
 wonted helplessness, perhaps to allow them to be fastened to the
 transverse beam of a cross; and the executioner should gird him,
 fastening him to the cross with cords; and he should be carried to
 death against his natural will, though glad thus to suffer for his
 Lord. It must have humbled him, showing him that he, the denier,
 was to die the same death as his Lord. According to Origen, Peter
 was crucified with his head downwards, . . . perhaps at his own re-
 quest, because in his humility he would not occupy the exact position
 held by his Master."—Peloubet.
     8. So it is now; many take their eyes from their own work, tc
 watch the course of others, as though it were a part of their duty to
 know all the particulars of a fellow laborer's calling. But the
 answer to Peter's question is a good one now for all inquisitive ones :
 "What is that to thee? follow thou Me."
     9. "At the time appointed, about five hundred believers were col-
 lected in little knots on the mountain-side, eager to learn all that
 could be learned from those who had seen Christ since His resurrec-
 tion. From group to group the disciples passed, telling all they had
 seen and heard of Jesus, and reasoning from the Scriptures as He
 had done with them. Thomas recounted the story of his unbelief,
 and told how his doubts had been swept away. Suddenly Jesus stood
 among them. No one could tell whence or how He came. Many
 who were present had never before seen Him; but in His hands and
  feet they beheld the marks of the crucifixion ; His countenance was
 as the face of God, and when they saw Him, they worshiped Him.
  But some doubted. So it will always be."—"The Desire of Ages,"
 p. 819.
