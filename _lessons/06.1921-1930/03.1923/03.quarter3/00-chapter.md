                              Notes
    1. In Peter's own summary at the conclusion of this
epistle are clearly seen the key words to the twofold burden
that called it forth: "beware" and "grow"; in other ,words,
warning and exhortation.
    2. Peter's Christian experience had been an intense one.
More than any other of the disciples, perhaps, he had gone to
the extreme of failure at the crisis of his Master's humilia-
tion. Now that his work is about done, Peter feels especially
anxious that after his death the believers shall continue to
grow in experimental knowledge of God.
    3. In 2 Peter 3: 2, Peter sums up what he has amplified in
chapter 1— that the means of Christian growth is the dili-
gent study of the Word, both prophetic and practical, in
order to keep fresh in mind the "exceeding great and pre-
cious promises" (2 Peter 1: 4), making them a basis for cul-
tivating the Christian virtues.
    4. According to the margin, the original, and other scrip-
tures, Jesus is both God (John 1: 1) and Saviour (Matt.
1:21; Luke 2: 11) ; He is also Son of man (Acts 7: 55, 56)
and Mediator (Heb. 9: 13-15). It is the righteousness of
such a being that forms the basis of faith, the most precious
possession of the believer.
    5. It is safe to say that the only reason there is a sinner
in the world to-day is because he does not know God and Jesus
our Lord as he ought; for really to know God and His Son
Jesus, is declared to be eternal life. John 17: 3. "My grace
is sufficient for thee," declared Jesus to Paul in a crisis of
the latter's experience — sufficient for every need. The only
way to grow in grace is to avail ourselves of it every time
we are under temptation or failure. The experience of grace
applied brings peace, and "grace upon grace" (John 1: 16,
A. R. V., margin) leads on to "perfect peace" (Isa. 26: 3).
    6. The word "knowledge" used in verses 2 and 3 is a
compound of the simple form used in verses 5 and 6. It de-
notes thorough knowledge, knowing a thing as it really is.
It implies expanding, added knowledge, and may properly be
rendered here "knowledge upon knowledge," until it includes
"all things that pertain unto life and godliness."
    7. It should be noted here that after the sinner has been
reconciled to God and has made every possible adjustment
with his neighbor, his Christian life has only begun. The
seed of faith hasnee merely planted; he must now cultivate
the plant diligently. He has merely cleared the obstructions
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY •                5

to advancement in the strait and narrow way. He has only
laid the foundation of the spiritual temple for God's indwell-
ing; he must now work at his own profession and build with
"all diligence."
    8. Faith: belief to the saving of the soul. Heb. 10: 39.
    Virtue: habitual purity of thought and action; and un-
wavering courage, lacking in Peter's early experience.
    Knowledge: faith and virtue without enlightenment are
like steam in the boiler of an engine without the intelligent
hand to direct it in effective service. "My people are de-
stroyed for lack of knoWledge." "Fools hate knowledge."
    Temperance: self-control. Besides the steam and the en-
gineer, the engine must have its "governor" to regulate its
action. The acquisition of knowledge must not become an
uncurbed passion; its proper use is what tells. Temperance
is self-control in all things — to the extent of non-indulgence
in hurtful practices, and of moderation in good ones.
    Patience: endurance. "Not weary in well-doing." It is
not enough to pursue virtue, knowledge, and temperance for
a time, or spasmodically; it must be a continuous persever-
ance in well-doing.
    Godliness: literally, reverence toward God,' spiritual-
mindedness. Unbelievers often cultivate patience, temper-
ance, knowledge, and virtue, but they do not cultivate these
qualities for the honor and glory of God. The believer's cul-
tivation of these graces must have in it the spiritual mind,
the unselfish motive — of honor to God and blessing to his
neighbor.
    Brotherly kindness: literally, brotherly love. Disinter-
ested kindness and loving service to a brother, friend, neigh-
bor, or enemy, is one of the highest practical tests of love to
God. The keeping of the last six commandments is the natural
 fruitage of keeping the first four.
• Charity: love. The keeping of all the commandments—
 the result of developing the previous seven graces of char-
acter.
     The virtues enumerated here are often called "Peter's
 ladder," and very properly. Another conception would be
 "Peter's rainbow"; for as the seven colors of the rainbow
 combine to fom white light, so the seven traits of Christian
 character enumerated by the apostle blend into the one su-
 preme virtue, charity or love.
    9. The word "ministered" in verse 11 is the same word
 that is rendered "add" in verse 5. Observe the parallel: if
 through diligence we add abundantly to our faith by develop-
 ing the sturdy elements of Christian character, there shall
 be added to us what we can not add — an abundant entrance
 into the everlasting kingdom.

                             Notes
      1. Here was a faithful preacher who was determined to
  "die in the harness," even though he probably understood
  that his end would come by violence. 2 Peter 1: 14; John
  21: 18, 19. His guiding principle had been, "We ought to
  obey God rather than men"; and his only apology for con-
  tinuing to preach Christ, even when forbidden by civil au-
  thority, was, "We can not but speak the things which we
  have seen and heard." ,
      2. This passage is sometimes interpreted to mean, We
  have the word of prophecy made more sure by the witness of
  the eye and the ear. But it reads literally thus: And we
  have more sure the prophetic word. This reading, and the
  additional fact that Peter lays the emphasis on taking heed
  to the prophecy rather than depending on his personal tes-
  timony, and supports his exhortation by showing how
  prophecy came, seem sufficient to justify our interpreting
  the passage thus: And we have, as a more sure testimony
• than that of one who had seen the transfiguration and heard
  the voice, the prophetic word. The angel of the annunciation
  quoted prophecy; Simeon was waiting for its fulfillment
  when he recognized the child Jesus; and Peter himself had
  depended largely upon prophecy in, interpreting the mean-
  ing of Pentecost.
       3. We can appreciate the force of this figure when we
  consider how great a light prophecy sheds on present-day
  events which without it would be as dark to believers as to
  unbelievers.
       4. That this verse deals with the origin of prophecy
  rather than its interpretation, seems evident from the con-
   nection and from a closer reading of the language used.
   Peter has just been affirming that he had not taught the be-
   lievers "cunningly devised fables"— something that he or
   some other man had made up — but like John, he declared
   what he saw and what he heard of the word of life. But,
   he continues, there is something still more sure as a basis
   for the believer's faith — the prophetic word. This is re-
   liable because, as verse 20 reads more literally, "No prophecy
   of Scripture comes on its own initiative"— it does not evolve
   itself. Nor was it brought forth by the will of man (verse
   21, R. V., margin), but the men who wrote it spoke as they
   were moved by the Holy Spirit. This leaves no room for hu-
   man devising, and does not depend upon personal testimony
   alone.
       5. The fulfillment of prophecy is like an anchor to the
   believer. When he is tempted to doubt .the true nature of
   some of his personal experiences, or the certainty of God's
8          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

word applying to his individual case, the surety of prophecy
strengthens his faith in God's "precious promises" to him
personally.

       state? James 4: 6, 7; Eph. 5: 21; 1 Peter 2: 13-17.
       Note 5.
                             Notes
   1. As the defection among the angels in heaven, headed
by Lucifer, was at first carried on by secret insinuations and
covert motives, so these false teachers do their work
"privily." The true follower of Jesus should ever be on his
guard against sly suggestions, "confidential" tales, and
skeptical intimations; for what looks innocent at first, often
leads to serious consequences, even to shipwreck of faith.
   2. Two things are characteristic • to false teachers: they
speak evil of the way of truth in which they once walked,
and they do their evil work among the believers, beguiling
unstable souls, and making merchandise of them to their own
ends. "From such turn away."
    3. The Lord saved Noah because he was "a just man,"
"perfect in his generation," and because he "walked with
God." But Lot, for the sake of sordid gain, pitched his tent
toward the cities of the plain, and presently entered Sodom,
dwelling among men who were "wicked and sinners before
the Lord exceedingly." Some of his daughters married
Sodomites and perished with them. Yet the Lord, at the
earnest entreaties of Abraham, five times repeated, saved
Lot by the extreme measure of sending two angels to his
house, who finally had to lay hands on him and draw him
out of destruction.
   4. For the one who is afflicted with impure, unwholesome
thoughts, this is a gospel remedy — keep the mind dwelling
                                                               •
10            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

upon such wholesome, uplifting things as are enumerated in
this verse. As a man "thinketh in his heart, so is he."
   5. Here are three steps, given in logical order, which if
taken will keep a man from becoming a despiser of govern-
ment or of good organization of any kind: 1. Submit to God.
2. Submit to one another in the fear of God. 3. Submit to
every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake.

12. By what striking proverbs does Peter describe the condi-

13. What exhortation should we heed? Heb. 3: 12-14.
                            Notes
    1. "Speak evil of the things that they understand not."
Here is the key to a large amount of mischief-making,—
people speaking against a thing on first impression, or with-
out sufficient knowledge of it to base a judgment upon. If
persons of critical temperament — in fact, if all Christians
everywhere — would adopt the principle of not commenting
upon a thing, especially to make slighting remarks about it,
until they understand it fully, with the reasons for it, how
many evils would be avoided!
    2. The cover of night is usually sought for evil. excesses
of all 'kinds. When people come to the place where they find
pleasure in such indulgences in the daytime, it is the boldness
of a reprobate condition. The reward of such is no worse
than the reward of false teachers,..according to the severe
arraignment of them in this chapter.
    3. It is "unstable souls" that are drawn into the vortex
of sin. How important, then, to give all diligence to build-
ing solid elements of stability into the character, according
to the outline in chapter 1!                            •
    4. The greatest bondage he world has ever known —
the bondage of sin — originathd in the despising of govern-
ment, and the vain promise of liberty, resulting in the final
destruction of the participants in the rebellion against God,
and of all who have joined it since. Beware of those whb
wear a cloak of liberty to conceal their maliciousness. See
1 Peter 2:15, 16.
    5. That there is added responsibility in a knowledge of
the truth, is no excuse for a man to avoid learning more of
it. He is held as responsible for his opportunities to know as
for his actual knowledge.


   "It is impossible to estimate the good results of one 'hour
or even half .an hour each day devoted in a cheerful, social
manner to the word of God."— Mrs. E. G. White, in "Testi-
monies on Sabbath School Work."

      ration to meet the Lord? Verse 44.
                              Notes
    1. "Walking after their own lusts" is the one cause above
all others, perhaps, that produces scoffers. These find satis-
faction in turning upon believers and scoffing at their "nar-
row," "deluded" faith and practice. A pricking conscience
seeks to obtain soothing by mocking at the conscientious.
    2. The strongest argument of last-day scoffers — in their
minds — is that "all things continue as they were from the
beginning of the creation." Thus it seems to the casual ob-
server, as he looks out on a perfect day, at the clear blue sky,
the beautiful trees and flowers, the merry birds and children.
Thus it seems also as he looks further upon the wonderful
progress in the arts and sciences and the spread of knowledge.
Yet these fail to look upon the signs the Saviour said should
appear in the heavens, the sea, and the things of nature and
experience about us. It is only the light of the Word, as
Peter goes, on to show, that will enable us to interpret cor-
rectly the external, material signs given us, in addition to
prophetic periods, as evidence of ,Christ's soon coming.
     3. The ignorance of scoffers at all times shows that they
do not receive nor study the word of God. They therefore do
not know the power of that Word, nor the part it acts in
world events. The antediluvians saw no evidence of the
 Flood in earth or sky. They evidently did not remember how
the heavens and the earth had been created (Ps. 33: 6) ; that
in their own day, the heavens and the earth "were" by the
word of God; and that at this same word, the course of na-
ture could be changed in a day. "The bright rays of-the
morning seemed to speak only prosperity and peace to
the cities of the plain. The stir of active life began in the
streets; men were going their various ways, intent on the busi-
 ness or the pleasures of the day. The sons-in-law of Lot
were making merry at the fears and warnings of the weak-
 minded old man. Suddenly and unexpectedly as would be
 a thunder peal from an unclouded sky, the tempest broke.
 The Lord rained brimstone and fire out of heaven upon the
 cities and the fruitful plain; its palaces and temples, costly
 dwellings, gardens and vineyards, and the gay, pleasure-
 seeking throngs that only the night before had insulted the
14          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

messengers of heaven,— all were consumed. The smoke df
the conflagration went up like the smoke of a great furnace.
And the fair vale of Siddim became a desolation, a place
never to be built up or inhabited,— a witness to all genera-
tions of the certainty of God's judgments upon transgression."
—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 162.
    4. The word "whereby" is a rendering of two words in
the Greek — through which, the "which" being plural in form,
and therefore not referring back directly to the word of God,
but to the heavens and the earth. In Gen. 7: 11, we read that
"the same day were all- the fountains of the great deep
broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened," the
heavens and the earth uniting in producing the Flood. The
consideration that the things of nature which seem to "con-
tinue as from the beginning of the creation," may be turned
any hour, by the word of God, into a means of destruction,
gives much weight to Peter's teaching in this chapter in
reference to the coming of Christ and the final destruction
of the world.
    5. "By the same word are kept in store, reserved unto
fire against the day of Judgment." The Revised Version,
margin, reads thus: "By the same word have been stored
with fire, being reserved against the day of Judgment." This
reading makes clearer the meaning of the whole passage,—
that as the water stored in the heavens and the earth was
turned into an element of destruction at the time of the Flood,
so in the day of Judgment the fire stored in the heavens and
the earth will be used in the destruction of ungodly men.

         3: 18, last part.
                             Notes
     1. This passage of Scripture makes it clear that the point
  of comparison is the coming suddenly or unexpectedly.
     2. "Burned up." In the comment by Westcott and Hort
  on the passage, other readings are given: "shall not be
  found," "shall disappear." The whole passage is evidently
  intended to describe the natural results of intense heat.
•    3. The effect should not be that of stimulating to greater
  spiritual earnestness merely because of a "fearful looking
  for of indignation," but knowledge of such an end to ma-
  terial things ought to lead us not to put our trust in them,
16           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

but to "desire a better country," a "kingdom which shall
never be destroyed."
    4. The word "hasting" has the force of either hastening
or desiring earnestly. If we take the latter meaning, and ap-
ply it as we are exhorted, it will surely lead to our helping
hasten that great event.
    5. Grace comes by faith. It is exercised toward us by
applying the righteousness of Christ to cover our sin. It
is multiplied through the increase of experimental knowledge
of God.

        tion? Eph. 4: 30-32.
                             Notes
    1. The real, living hope of soon meeting Jesus trans-
forms and shapes the whole life. By faith we see Jesus
hastening forward His closing work in order that He may
come again. He is preparing a place for us in the heavenly
city. John 14: 1-3.. He is making intercession for us be-
fore the Father's throne, that we may be prepared for the
place. Heb. 7: 25. And our attitude is one of watching for
His coming —"looking for that blessed hope." Titus 2: 13.
Now we must do the work He has left us to do, and be ready
to meet Him.
    2. Notice the marginal reading of the text, "run out as
leaking vessels." Unless the truths that we know, are kept
living and bright in our hearts by daily personal experience
in the Lord, the level of our "love of the truth" will be found
sinking lower and lower, imperceptibly perhaps, as' water
sinks slowly in a leaking vessel. The Revised Version puts
it, "lest haply we drift away from them." Ships do not drift
into port, but are easily carried by tide and current or storm
on to the rocks to disaster.
     3. We can no more expect to be spiritually strong with-
out feeding the soul upon the word of God, than physically
strong without eating our daily food. Take some Scripture
portion into every day's work, and let it speak to the heart
again and again amidst the hurry of business. It will keep
the thought of God near.
• 4. Every believer is marking out a path for some one else.
A Swiss mountaineer starting out from home along a familiar
way by the edge of a precipice, with little thought of where
18         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

he was stepping, was startled to hear a child's voice crying,
"Be careful where you step, papa, for I am following you."
All are making footprints for some one to follow. Let us
carry a burden for the straying ones who may have been
turned out of the way by some one's Misstep. Jesus has
marked the path. He is the one to follow, having left "us
an example, that ye should follow His steps." 1 Peter 2: 21.

       Him to the cross? Luke 23: 34.
14. What shows that Stephen cherished no unkind feeling to-
       ward those who stoned him? Acts 7: 59, 60.
                              Notes
    1. The Bible makes a distinction between a sin and a fault.
We sin against God; "for sin is the transgression of the
law." 1 John 3: 4. We trespass one against another. These
offenses, while involving sin, are called faults, and should be
corrected by confession and forgiveness. The only remedy
for either pointed out in the word of God is heartfelt con-
fession. One writer aptly says: "Confess your sins to God,
who only can forgive them, and your faults to one another.
If you have given offense to your friend or neighbor, you are
to acknowledge your wrong, and it is his duty freely to for-
give you. Then you are to seek the forgiveness of God, be-
cause the brother you have wounded is the property of God,
and in injuring him you sinned against his Creator and
Redeemer."
    To confess one's faults is not an easy thing to do; in fact,
it is one ofc the hardest lessons to learn, for it requires the
grace of humility as well as that of sorrow and true repent-
ance. Some one has said that the four hardest words to pro-
nounce in the English language are, "I made a mistake."
When Frederick the Great wrote to the Prussian Senate, "I
have just lost a battle, and it is my own fault," Goldsmith
says, "His confession shows more greatness than his vic-
tories."                                                      •
    The confession should not only be complete, but it should
be as broad and as public as was the offense. Private offenses
should be confessed in private.
    2. This scripture is especially encouraging. God hates
sin. He wants us likewise to hate it and shun it, because it
invariably leads into trouble, causes sorrow of heart, and in
the end brings death. But when one is involved in it, as was
 David, as soon as it is acknowledged and sincerely confessed,
that very moment it is forgiven. David said, "I have sinned."
 The immediate answer was returned, "The Lord . . hath
 put away thy sin."
     3. It is much easier to tell some one else of a brother's
 faults than it is to tell him of them himself ; but this is not
 the Christian way to proceed. The first efforts should be
20          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

made with the offender in person, and alone. But it is easier
even to tell a brother of his faults than it is to confess to him
our own. This, again, let it be noted, is a very difficult les-
son to learn, a Christian duty difficult to perform. Only
humility and the grace of God will enable us to do it.
    4. "He who is unforgiving, cuts off the very channel
through which alone he can receive mercy from God. We
should not think that unless those who have injured us con-
fess the wrong, we are justified in withholding from them
our forgiveness. It is their part, no doubt, to humble their
hearts by repentance and confession; but we are to have
a spirit of compassion toward those who have, trespassed
against us, whether or not they confess their faults. However
sorely they may have wounded us, we are not to cherish our
grievances, and sympathize with ourselves over our injuries;
but as we hope to be pardoned for our offenses against God,
we are to pardon all who have done evil to us."—"Thoughts
from the Mount of Blessing," page 166.
   5. This expression means an unlimited number of times.
We must pardon offenses against us though ever so often
done; we must forgive to the end.

        keeping? 1 John 1: 9; Rom. 4: 7; 5: 1. Note 3.
14. When does the Sabbath begin and end? Lev. 23: 32;
        Mark 1: 32. How much of the day is holy?
15. What is the sixth day of the week called in Scripture?
        Luke 23: 54. What work was to be done in the camp
        of Israel on the sixth day in preparation for the Sab-
        bath. Ex. 16: 23. Note 4.          •
16: How does the Lord regard carelessness or disobedience
        in the treatment of the sacred and holy? Eze. 22:
        26, 31.
17. What promise of blessing is made to the keepers of God's
        Sabbath? Isa. 58: 13, 14.
                              Notes
     1. The burden of the message of Revelation 14 is a call
to "worship Him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea,"
etc. This is a plain reference to the terms of the fourth
commandment. It is the Creator who is to be recognized -in
worship, whose sign or memorial is His holy Sabbath. The
warning of the last gospel message is against giving homage
to the apostagy, whose sign or mark is the rival day, Sunday.
     2. It is at the time when the Lord says that His "salva-
tion is near to come" and His "righteousness to be revealed"
that Sabbath keeping is emphasized as a feature of that
preparation which must be undertaken by the children of
men. The Lord placed a blessing on the Sabbath day; and
those who keep it, find the blessing. We hear this testimony
from men and women in. all lands. The Sabbath is a blessed
gift from God to men—something given to us, not a day
taken from us, as appears to unbelief.
     3. Some people ask, "Do you think Sabbath keeping will
 save you?" Not at all. In fact, we must be saved from sin
by faith in Jesus•in order truly to keep the Sabbath. So it
 is with obedience to all God's commandments. We are not
 saved because we obey, but we obey because we have found
 the saving grace of Christ. The call to keep the Sabbath
 holy is in a direct way a call to holiness of life and the
 putting away of sin.
22          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

    4. "God requires that His holy day be as sacredly observed
now as in the time of Israel. The command given to the
Hebrews should be regarded by all Christians as an injunc-
tion from Jehovah to them. The day before the Sabbath
should be made a day of preparation, that everything may
be in readiness for its sacred hours. In no case should our
own business be allowed to encroach upon holy time. God
has directed that the sick and suffering be cared for; the
labor required to make them comfortable is a work of mercy,
and no violation of the Sabbath; but all unnecessary work
should be avoided. Many carelessly put off till the beginning
of the Sabbath little things that might have been done on the
day of preparation. This should not be. Work that is
neglected until the beginning of the Sabbath should remain
undone until it is past. This course might help the memory
of these thoughtless ones, and make them careful to do
their own work on the six working days."—"Patriarchs and
Prophets," p. 296. •

15. What are we doing for ourselves in devoting our means
      to the work of God? Matt. 6: 19-21.
                             Notes
    1. The Lord reserved one day of the week from common
use by man, and made it holy, to be kept by man in recogni-
tion of the Creator's sovereignty over all. So He has re-
served one tenth of man's income as His, to be returned to
God in recognition of the Lord's ownership of all things.
"It is He that giveth thee power to get wealth." Deut. 8: 18.
    2. "All the tithes." The Revised Version renders it,
"Bring ye the whole tithe into the. storehouse." The word
"tithe" means a tenth. To bring a twentieth, or a thirtieth,
does not meet His call. The Lord asks for "the whole tithe."
We are to bring to the Lord's treasury, the treasury of His
church, a tenth of all our income.
    3. This record shows the payment of tithes over four
hundred years before the establishing of the Levitical serv-
ice. And the text suggests that the devoting of the tithe to
God's service was not a new thing even to Abraham. It is
treated as an obligation well known to Abraham, the father
of the faithful. Later, when Jacob made his vow to God,
he said, "Of all that Thou shalt give me I will surely give
the tenth unto Thee." Gen. 28: 22. These patriarchs, with
whom God held communion, were taught to reserve the tithe
as the Lord's.
    4. "Even so," says the Scripture. Just as the ti        as
set apart by God in old time for the service of the sa
"even so" the gospel ministry is to be supported in the carry-
ing of the message of salvation to all the world. The Levites
24            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

paid a tithe of their income, as well as the people. Num.
18: 26. All are to recognize God's ownership.
    "Let none feel at liberty to retain their tithe to use ac-
cording to their own judgment. They are not to use it for
themselves in any emergency, nor to apply it as they see fit,
even in what they may regard as the Lord's work.
The minister should, by precept and example, teach the people
to regard the tithe as sacred. He should not feel that he can
retain and apply it according to his own judgment because
he is a minister. It is not. his. . . . Let him not give his
influence to any plans for diverting from their legitimate
use the tithes and offerings dedicated to God. Let them be
placed in His treasury, and held sacred for God's service as
He has appointed."- Mrs. E. G. White, in "Review and
Herald," November 10, 1896.

                             Notes                  .
    1. Temperance, or self-control, is a fruit of the Spirit.
And where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. In
Christ, we find liberation from the power of every habit of
self-indulgence. The spiritual nature is made master over
the flesh, instead of being ruled by it. There is power in
Christ to set men free from the drink habit, and the tobacco
habit, and all other habits that enslave.
    2. These principles never change. Conditions change and
human requirements vary ; but the principle holds always
true, that every Christian is under bonds to shape his life in
all things to glorify God, according to the light given him of ,
God. This emphasizes the importance of becoming informed
as to the principles of proper home sanitation and healthful
living. "Parents should seek to awaken in their children an
interest in the study of physiology. Youth need to be in-
structed in regard to their own bodies. . . . If parents them-
selves would obtain knowledge upon this subject, and felt
the importance of putting it into practical use, we should see
a better condition of things."—"Christian Temperance," p. 71.
    3. The Bible rule is to eat for strength, not for mere in-
dulgence of appetite. This calls for the supply of proper
food as well as the elimination of unhealthful articles. "A
diet lacking in the proper elements .of nutrition, brings re-
proach upon the cause of health reform. . . . Some of our
people, while conscientiously abstaining from eating im-
proper foods, neglect to supply themselves with the elements
necessary for the sustenance of the body. Those who take
an extreme view of health reform are in danger of preparing
26          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

tasteless dishes, making them so insipid that they are not
satisfying. Food should be prepared in such a way that it
will be appetizing as well as nourishing."—"Testimonies for
the Church," vol. 9, pp. 161, 162.
    4. "The inhabitants of the antediluvian world were in-
temperate in eating and drinking. They would have flesh
meats, although at that time God had given man no permis-
sion to eat animal food. They ate and drank till the indul-
gence of their depraved appetites knew no bounds, and they
became so corrupt that God could bear with them no longer."
—"Christian Temperance," p. 43.
    5. "When we study this question in the fear of God, we
shall learn that it is best, for both our physical and our
spiritual advancement, to observe simplicity in diet. Let us
patiently study this question. We need knowledge and judg-
ment in order to move wisely in this matter. Nature's laws
are not to be resisted, but obeyed. Those who have received
instruction regarding the evils of the use of flesh foods, tea
and coffee, and rich and unhealthful food preparations, and
who are determined to make a covenant with God by sacri-
fice, will not continue to indulge their appetite for food that
they know to be unhealthful. God demands that the appe-
tites be cleansed, and that self-denial be practiced in regard
to those things which are not good. This is a work that will
have to be done before His people can stand before Him a
perfected people."—"Testimonies for the Church," vol. 9, pp.
153, 154.

    14. Give some reason why the work of educating our children

    16. What is the highest aim for a successful career? Dan.
          12:3.
    17. What words will parents, teachers, and workers for souls

                                 Notes •
'      1. In full harmony with this answer is the familiar pas-
    sage in "Patriarchs and Prophets," page 595, "The true ob-
    ject of education is to restore the image of God in the soul."
       2. There are seeming exceptions to this rule; but where
    the promised result does not follow, careful examination will
    usually show some fault in the training rather than in the
    principle enunciated.
       3. In the very nature of the case, the state-supported
    school can not make the Bible the basis of instruction. This
    work can be done only by the church and the parents. "Those
    who attend the public schools often associate with others
    more neglected than they, those who, aside from the time
    spent in the schoolroom, are left to obtain a street education.
28          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

The hearts of the young are easily impressed; and unless their
surroundings are of the right character, Satan will use these
neglected children to influence those who are more carefully
trained. Thus before Sabbath-keeping parents know what
evil is being done, the lessons of depravity are learned, and
the souls of their little ones are corrupted."—"Testimonies
 for the Church," vol. 6, p. 193.
    4. "The church has a special work to do in educating and
training its children that they may not, in attending school,
or in any other association, be influenced by those of corrupt
habits."— Ibid.
    "Wherever there are a few Sabbath keepers, the parents
should unite in providing a .place for a day school where their
children and youth can be instructed. They should employ
a Christian teacher, who, as a consecrated missionary, shall
educate the children in such a way as to lead them to become
missionaries. Let teachers be employed who will give a
thorough education in the common branches, the Bible being
made the foundation and the life of all study."— Id., p. 198.
    5. While primarily the education of the child is the duty
of the parent, the training of the children of the church is a
part of church duty. "Feed My lambs," said Jesus to the
church. "Let all share the expense. Let the church see that
those who ought to receive its benefits are attending the
school. Poor families should be assisted. We can not call
ourselves true missionaries if we neglect those at our very
doors, who are at the most critical age, and who need our
aid to secure knowledge and experience that will fit them for
the service of God."— Id., p. 217.
    6. "It should be the great aim in every intermediate school
to do most thorough work in the common branches."—"Coun-
sels to Teachers," p. 210.
    "The word of God is to lie at the foundation of all the
work done in our intermediate schools. And the students are
to be shown the true dignity of labor." "In these schools
thorough work is to be done; for many students will go forth
from them directly into the great harvest field. They will go
forth to use what they have learned, as canvassers, and as
helpers in various lines of evangelistic work. Many workers,
after laboring for a time in the field will feel the need of
further study, and with the experience gained in the field will
be prepared to value school privileges, and to make rapid ad-
vancement. Some will desire an education in the higher
branches of study. For these our colleges have been estab-
lished."— Id., p. 203.
    7. "The primary object of our college was to afford young
men an opportunity to study for the ministry, and to pre-
pare young persons of both sexes to become workers in the
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                29

various branches of the cause."—"Testimonies for the
Church," vol. 5, p. 60.
    "In our schools the standard of education must not be
lowered. It must be lifted higher and still higher, far above .
where it now stands; but the education given must not be
confined to a knowledge of textbooks merely."—"Testimonies
for the Church," vol. 6, p. 126.
    "While attending school, the youth should have an oppor-
tunity for learning the use of tools. Under the guidance of
experienced workmen, carpenters who are apt to teach, pa-
tient, and kind, the students themselves should erect buildings
on the school grounds and make needed improvements, thus
by practical lessons learning how to build economically. The
students should also be trained to manage all the differ-
ent kinds of work connected with printing, such as typeset-
ting, presswork, and bookbinding, together with tent making
and other useful lines of work. Sm'all fruits should be
planted, and vegetables and flowers cultivated, and this work
the lady students may be called out of doors to do. Thus,
while exercising brain, bone, and muscle, they will also be
gaining a knowledge of practical life."— Id., p. 176.
    8. "It is for the honor of Christ that well educated
workers should be multiplied among us; they will be better
able to communicate the truth in a clear, intelligent way, and
the truth should be presented in a way that will be as free
 as possible from defects."—"Christian Education," p. 138.

     Matt. 18: 12-14.
7. What evidences are there in the work of Christ of this

8. What record is there of the personal work of Christ for
     individuals? Matt. 9: 9; Mark 1: 19, 20; John 3: 1-21;

9. What may we learn from the way in which Christ worked
     with individuals? Answer: To begin by finding in the
     person something that we can commend. John 1: 42,
     47. Note 5.
10. What is another important principle to be followed in
     personal work? Answer: To begin with that in which
     the individual is interested, and from that lead to that
     which concerns his salvation. John 4: 7-10; 6: 26, 27,
     34, 35; Luke 5: 4-6, 10. Note 6.
11. Why is personal work often found the hardest to do?
     Answer: Because Satan knows it is the most effective.
     Eph. 6: 12. Note 7.
                            Notes
   1. God has given to every man a free will to choose 10. fol-
low good or evil. it is the will of God that every one should
choose to follow Him, but not all accept this will of God as
their guide and director. He commissions those who accept
his will as theirs, to labor to bring others to accept it too.
   2. "The words, 'Go ye into all the world, and preach the
gospel to every creature' (Mark 16: 15), are spoken to each
one of Christ's followers. All who are ordained unto the life
of Christ are ordained to work for the salvation of their fel-
low men. The same longing of soul that He felt for the sav-
ing of the lost is to be manifest in them."—"Testimonies for
the Church," vol. 8, p. 16.
   3. "The case of Philip and Nathanael is an example of
true home missionary work. Philip had seen Jesus, and was
convinced that He was the Messiah. In his joy he wished his
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  31 •
friends also to know the good news. He desired that the truth
which had brought such comfort to him should be shared by
Nathanael. True grace in the heart will always reveal its
presence by diffusing itself. Philip went in search of Na-
thanael, and as he called, Nathanael answered from his place
of prayer under the fig tree. Nathanael had not had the
privilege of listening to the words of Jesus, but he was being
drawn toward Him in spirit. He longed for light, and was
at that moment sincerely praying for it. . . . At Philip's in-
vitation, Nathanael sought and found the Saviour, and in his
turn joined in the work of winning souls for Christ."—"Testi-
2nonies for the Church," vol. 6, p. 428.
     4. The need of the one blind man called forth the sympathy
and help of the Saviour; He went sixty miles to help one who
was in need; He crossed the sea to save another; He re-
crossed the sea to help one woman and one child. The Saviour
was always ready to spend and be spent for the one soul who
might need His help.
     5. "The use of hearty commendation is common in Christ's
earthly ministry. The surest way to drive men from us is
to begin with condemnation or criticism. It is not reason-
 able to suppose that we can win men to ourselves or to Christ
 if we begin by telling them of their sins. Christ did not work
 that way. He never began His message to any individual
 or group of persons by condemnation of sib. He did not hesi-
 tate to denounce sin and sinful persons under certain cir-
 cumstances; . . . but when Jesus set out to win a person to
 Himself, it seemed to be His resolute purpose to find some-
 thing in that one which He could commend, and then to com-
 mend it in all heartiness.
     "For example, the men whom Jesus first invited to follow
 Him undoubtedly had as glaring sins and as obvious defects
 as most of us have to-day. Those imperfections must have
 been quite as much of a trial to Jesus as our fellows' short-
 comings are to us. But He did not commence by telling them
 of this, nor did He seek to help them at the outset by show-
 ing them what was wrong with them. His first recorded
 word to faulty Simon was, 'Thou art Simon the son of Jona;
 thou shalt be called Rock'; as though to say, 'for you deserve
 a stalwart name.' So with another of the disciples: there is
 no reason to suppose that Jesus could not have found, and
  did not see, any sin in Nathanael; but instead of condemning
  that which was there, Jesus' . first word was an outspoken,
  hearty admiration of this man, in that he was particularly
  free from craftiness, or deceit. . . . We must learn to work
  in that way, if we would take men alive as Christ did. We
  shall never lose, but always gain, in our influence for Christ,
  if we determinedly seek that which can be commended in one
32            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

whom we would win, and speak heartily of it."—"Taking Men
Alive," pp. 176, 177.
     6. One of the principles on which Christ worked was that
of giving the present interest of the one with whom He
worked prominent place to begin with. An instance of this
is found in the first miraculous draft of fishes and the call
to the fishermen. With the woman of Samaria, He com-
menced with a request for a drink of water, that in which
she was then interested. The multitude who had been mi-
raculously fed, He led from the temporal bread in which they
were interested to the Bread of heaven. In the same manner,
we must, if we would be successful soul winners, begin our
work with the subjects in which the people are interested.
    7. Dr. Trumbull was a personal worker for nearly fifty
years. Here is his testimony concerning this question: "From
nearly half a century of such practice, as I have had op-
portunity day by day, I can say that I have spoken with thou-
sands upon thousands on the subject of their spiritual
welfare. Yet, so far from my becoming accustomed to this mat-
ter, so that I can take hold of it as a matter of course, I find
it as difficult to speak about it at the end of these years
as at the beginning. Never to the present day can I speak
to a single soul for Christ without being reminded by Satan
that I am in danger of harming the cause by introducing
it just now. If there is one thing that Satan is sensitive
about, it is the danger of a Christian harming the. cause
he loves by speaking'of Christ to a needy soul. He [Satan]
has more than once, or twice, or thrice, kept me from speak-
ing on the subject by his sensitive pious caution, and he has
tried a thousand times to do so. Therefore my experience
leads me to suppose that he is urging other persons to try
any method for souls except the best one.
    "Have we not the answer here to the question as to why
this work is the hardest in the world? Just because it is the
most effective work for Christ, the devil opposes it most bit-
terly, and always will while he is permitted to oppose any-
thing good. The devil strikes hardest and most persistently
at the forces which will, if effective, hurt his cause most. . . .
This, then, is what we face when we enter upon this [per-
sonal] work. The greatest and hardest work in the world,
it will never grow easy, but it will never grow small. If it
always remains the hardest, it always remains also the great-
est."—"Taking Men Alive," pp. 44-.l6.
    The series of Senior Sabbath school lessons for next quar-
ter is entitled "The Gifts and Fruits of the Spirit." The book,
"The Ministry of the Spirit," by Elder G. B. Thompson, will
be a valuable help.
