              SOUTH AND EAST CHINA
ARE YOU READING THE "SIGNS" AND
   USING IT TO REACH OTHERS?
  The "Signs of the Times," with its up-to-the-minute presentation of •
current events and interesting Bible study features, is exerting a
mighty influence wherever it goes. Never before were the mails so
full of appreciative letters from Christian people who are reading it,
and from those who are seeing results from its distribution. Repre-
senting the first class, the following letter from a Presbyterian lady
in Washington, D. C., is typical:
        "Inclosed is my order for a renewal. Did think I would not
      take the paper another year, but I cannot live without its
      weekly visits ; its messages have become a part of my life. I
      love the Bible lessons, the daily meditations, the poetry ; in
      fact, every word is read and passed on to others.
        "And I'm sorry the paper is not larger. Am I not selfish?
      I know* is the best religious paper, printed, and cheaper than
      many others. The paper has given me a deeper insight into
      the Bible; made my life happier, richer, fuller; and drawn me
      nearer to God than I have ever been before. I wanted to write
      and tell you what it has done for one subscriber. May the
      `Signs of the Times'' girdle the whole earth, and the true
      Sabbath be an established fact."

  Of the possibilitiei in using the "Signs" to bring persons to an
acceptance of the truth, the following note--only one of hundreds
received—tells the story:
        "I want to tell you how the Lord is touching hearts. Brother
      Kruse seat the 'Signs' to a Mr. Snyder, out here in the
      country, and from that one paper we have three in this mes-
      sage,—Mr. and Mrs. J. R. Snyder and her brother, Mr. Quinn,
      —and prospects are good for three more. Praise the Lord from
      whom all blessings flow!
        "Yesterday afternoon five different ones came to us in the
      afternoon and evening to find out if this is the truth about the
      Sabbath ; and this morning a stranger came and ordered the
      'Signs' and paid for it for his neighbor, Mr. J. R. Johnson.
        "How we wish for a good minister to teach these hungry
      souls, and preach to them ! Pray for us that we may receive
      wisdom from God."
  While you are engaged in other work, if need be, you can be en-
joying a continuous experience in active work for God by personally
getting the "Signs" into homes, by furnishing it to persons direct
through the mails, or by helping to furnish the church club of papers
that others are distributing.
  The plan is so simple and inexpensive, but it is fraught with un-
limited possibilities for good. In the church club you pay $1.10 a
copy a year for any number of copies above five; your lists of single
names and addresses,, where five or more are furnished, are received at
$1.25 each a year. Order through your church missionary secretary
or of your tract society.
     THE EPISTLE OF JAMES
                  INTRODUCTORY NOTE

    AUTHORSHIP.— Several persons bearing the name of James
are mentioned in the New. Testament: (1)L the son of Zebedee,
Mark 1: 19, 20; 3: 17; (2) the son of Alpheus, Matt. 10: 3;
Mark 3: 18; (3) the Lord's brother, Matt. 13: 55; Mark 6:
3; (4) James the Less (possibly the same as the second men-
tioned), Mark 15: 40; (5) the brother of Jude (who may be
identical with one or more of the foregoing), Jude 1. While
there is some question as to the authorship of the epistle of
James, Bible scholars generally concede that it was written
by James the Just, the Lord's brother. He is called "the
Just" by Josephus, who says that he was celebrated for his
integrity and zeal. Dr. Adam Clarke says: "Modern critics.
are agreed, with almost entire unanimity, that 'James the
brother of our Lord,' who seems to have been recognized as
the chief minister of the church at Jerusalem, was the author
of the epistle." "He resided at Jerusalem, seems to have
been married (1 Cor. 9: 5), and was early recognized as a
leader in the church. Acts 12: 17; 21: 18; Gal. 2: 9, 12. He
appears to have seen Christ shortly before His ascension
 (1 Cor. 15: 7), and to have presided over the council held at
Jerusalem A. D. 49. - Acts 15: 13."—"Smith's Bible Dic-
tionary."
    DATE AND PLACE.— There is some difference of opinion
concerning the date of the epistle, the latest date assigned
being A. D. 62. "The epistle of James is generally supposed
to have been written at Jerusalem, about A. D. 61, by James
the Just, shortly before his death."— Id.
    "Many expressions and references in the epistle make it
fully certain that it was written before the destruction of
Jerusalem. . . . It would seem, from a comparison of all the
evidence that can be made to bear upon the case, that the
epistle could-not have been written earlier than A. D. 50, nor
later than A. D. 62."— Adam Clarke. •

                              Notes
    1. James assumes no title. He does not claim to be the
Lord's brother, or an apostle, or bishop at Jerusalem. He
simply designates himself as "a servant of God," a title that
is an honor above all others.
    He writes- to the twelve tribes scattered abroad,— to all
Christians. His exhortations to faith, stability, obedience,
patience, and devotion to God, while equally applicable to any
age and to any people, may be especially helpful to those who
live through the conflicts of the last days.
    2. As the instruction given reaches down to the last days,
and Christians are designated as "the twelve tribes which are
scattered abroad," it shows that no Israel is now recognized
but Christian, or spiritual Israel. This would explain how the
sealing work of Rev. 7: 1-8, which gathers twelve thousand
from each of the twelve tribes of Israel, can be fulfilled in
the last generation.
    3. "The word which is here translated 'temptation' sig-
nifies affliction, persecution, or trial of any kind; and in this
sense is used her
                e."— Clarke.
    When temptations come, we are not to consider them as
a punishment, or some curse or calamity visited upon us be-
cause we are wicked. God's people in all ages have been
tried, many even suffering death.
    4. The word "steadfastness" is given in the margin of the
Revised Version instead of "patience." This gives the true
idea. A person might seemingly be very patient and yet be
very unstable. The design of all trials is to develop stead-
fastness, and stability is wrought into the character of the
person who patiently endures trials.
    5. Nothing presents a more striking symbol of unstability
and restlessness than the surging, ever-changing, shifting
waves of the sea, never at rest, always on the move, coming
 in and going out, subject to wind and tide. Compare Isa.
57: 20, 21. The Lord does not want us to be like that. He
exhorts us to be established on the immovable rock of faith.
It is ask and receive, seek and find. If we ask fin' wisdom,
He will not upbraid us for our ignorance, but from the store-
house of His fullness, will give liberally all that we need.

   In the latest quarterly report made out by the General
 Conference Sabbath School Department, 21,632 were reported
 present every Sabbath, and 9,218 had studied the lesson every
,day.

  At the present time, our Sabbath schools are giving about
$28,000 a week, or $4,000 a day.

15. What has God done for us? By what are we begotten?
       For what purpose? Verse 18. Compare 1 Peter 1:
       23. Note 7.
                             Notes
    1. Among men, there are class distinctions; but all are one
in Christ Jesus. Christianity brings all up on the same level.
The true value of a man consists in moral worth. Character
is what the Lord considers of value. Christ did not die for
the talented and wealthy only.. He died for all. All have
equal opportunity to be saved. The poor of this world, the
ignorant, the downcast, the downtrodden, the one of lowly
rank or humble circumstances, though of "low degree" in
man's sight, may be of infinite value in God's sight. The rich
of this world, without noble aspirations, covetous and selfish,
unless they repent, may be only as a withered branch. Well
indeed may such a one who comes to himself, and seeks the
Lord in lowliness of spirit, rejoice in that his heart has beer
broken and humbled.
    2. Before we receive the crown, we must be tested. It is
in trial that the chaff is separated from the wheat. There
must be battle fields in every life. Fire and hammer and file
are necessary to give form to metal. So character is shaped
and brightened in trial. Those who faithfully endure the
grinding, testing process ,will receive the crown.
    3. The word "lust" here means desire. The source of all
temptation is in man himself. There may be inducement to
sin; but there must be some inclination, some desire for it, to
give it power. If there were no desire, or appetite, for food,
there would be no disposition to eat even if food were placed
before us. The unrestrained man will be drawn along by his
own natural propensities to sin. Power over sin in his own
fleshly heart is the need of every human being.
    4. The wages, or reward, of sin is not eternal life in
misery, and unspeakable torture in the lake of fire; but it is
death, the second death, in the "fire prepared for the devil
and his angels." The righteous receive the gift of God,
eternal life; the wicked, the opposite, eternal death.
    5. Error is darkness. Truth is light. Ignorance of the
Scriptures and of the power of God is responsible for all the
error and darkness that cover the earth, whether scientific
or religious.
    6. God is always the same, at all seasons and in all ages.
"I am the Lord, I change not." There is no alteration in His
character, His purposes, His plans. What He was in the
eternity of the past, He will be countless ages yet to come.
Human affairs change, nations pass away, but God is the
same. We have to-day the same blessed Christ that healed
8            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

the sick and comforted the sorrowful when on earth. Heb.
1: 10-12; 13:8.
    7. The word from which the phrase "begat He us" is
translated is the same that in verse 15 is rendered "bringeth
forth." Sin "bringeth forth" death, but the word of God
"bringeth forth" life. It- is the voices of God, His word, that
"bringeth forth" the dead out of their dusty beds at the
resurrection.

16. To what should we not be conformed? What transforma-
      tion should be experienced? Why should this change
      take place? Verse 2.
                            Notes
    1. "In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin."
Prov. 10: 19. "He that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life."
Prov. 13: 3. "Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine
heart be hasty to utter anything before God." Eccl. 5: 2.
Many times we have occasion to regret that wet have spoken,
but seldom that we remained silent.
  • 2. The Revised Version reads, "the implanted Word;" and
in the margin, "the inborn Word." The word of God im-
planted in the heart creates us new creatures in Christ Jesus.
"Having been begotten again, not of corruptible seed, but of
incorruptible, through the word of God who liveth and abid-
eth." 1 Peter 1: 23, A. R. V., margin.
    3. It is not enough to look occasionally into the great
mirror of God's law; because, as in looking into a glass, we
soon lose sight of the defects shown us. We should continu-
ally look into the law. of God, by which sin is revealed, not
being forgetful hearers, but doers of the Word. Some en-
deavor to destroy the law, because it reveals defects and
failures in their lives. This is no wiser than it would be to
dash a mirror into fragments because it revealed defects in
our persons or clothing. Such are like the Hindu who, when
the microscope made known to him the fact that there were
living organisms in the water he drank, at once destroyed the
microscope.
    4. "Many will be weighed in the balance and found want-
ing in this mptter of so great importance. Where are the
              SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY               11

Christians who walk by this rule? who will take God's part
against the evil speaker? who will please God, and set a
watch, a continual watch, before the mouth, and keep the
door of the lips? Speak evil of no man. Hear evil of no man.
If there be no hearers, there will be no speakers of evil. If
anyone speaks evil in your presence, check him. Refuse to
hear him, though his manner be ever so soft, and his accents
mild. He may profess attachment, and yet throw out covert
hints and stab the character in the dark."—"Testimonies,"
vol. 2, p. 54.
    5. Much is said about the need of the' physical nature for
pure water, pure air, and pure food. But that which is of
the greatest importance is pure religion. It is possible to
drink pure water, breathe pure air, and eat pure food, and
yet be corrupt in heart, and have a censorious, domineering
character. Only by the power of God, through the Holy
Spirit, can the wicked, deceitful heart -of man be changed.

                             Notes
    1. The Revised Version, margin, of this text reads, "My
brethren, do ye, in accepting persons, hold the faith of our
Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory?" None who profess
the pure and undefiled religion of our Lord should countenance
any distinction, or manifest any partiality, among members
of the church, because of difference in wealth or social stand-
ing. We are all one in Christ Jesus.
    2. While God is no respecter of persons, He is a respecter
of character. He will immortalize a pure and holy character
in His kingdom. We too should love and respect good charac-
ter, no matter in whom it may be found.
    3. We are here cited to the higher, supreme law, before
which all will stand on an equality. There will be no •rich or
poor, no high or low. Right and wrong, guilt and innocence
alone will be considered. It is "the royal law" because it is
the law of the great King. Before this law all must bow..
By it all differences must finally be settled.
    4. The moral law "is that revelation of the divine will
which relates to the duties men owe both to their Maker and
to their fellow men, or neighbors, as explained in Luke 10:
33-37. This law is spiritual and perfect, extending to all the
inward creations and outward actions of men, and can never
be changed or annulled."—"Binney's Theological Compend,"
p. 153.

   •                          Notes
     1. "Can faith save him?"- Yes, real faith can save the
soul. "By grace are ye saved through faith." "He that be-
14          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

lieveth • . . shall be saved." Works cannot save us. We
are saved by faith alone. But the writer of this epistle is
seeking to show that the mere profession of faith does not
prove that we have faith. James is setting forth the empti-
ness of the claim when there is no fruit in the life as a proof.
A sign advertising wares for sale is not sure evidence that
the goods are within. The meaning here seems to be that
that faith which a man may claim to have, but which does not
manifest itself in a holy life, will save no one, for it is not
genuine faith.
    2. The apostle. Paul speaks of the "work of faith." 1
Thess. 1: 3. Faith is living, and manifests itself in good
works. That kind of faith which permits a man to say, "I
have faith," and at the same time allow the destitute to go
unfed and unclothed, when he might minister to their needs,
is of no avail. It is dead. It does not exist in reality. Such
a person does not really believe. He is professing to be what
he is not. The fruit seen in the life will determine whether
or hot we have real faith. The tree is known by the fruit.
    3. "The word which ,is rendered 'yea' would be better
rendered by 'but.' The apostle designs to introduce an ob-
jection, not to make an affirmation. The sense is, 'Some one
might say,' or, `To this it might be urged in reply.' That is,
it might perhaps be said that religion is not always manifested
in the same way, or we should not infer, because it is not
always exhibited in the same form, that it does not exist.
One man may manifest it in one way, and another in another,
and still both have true piety. One may be distinguished for
his faith, and another for his works, and both may have real
religion."— Barnes.
    "But it must be a living faith— a faith that shows its
sincerity by the sacrifices of self which it makes, by the works
of love which it performs. A merely intellectual orthodoxy
may be held by demons. A mere profession of faith may be
worth no more than the body of a man without the breath
of life. A true faith loves, works, lives. It regulates the
conscience, the speech, and the life, by the conviction of God's
constant presence; it shows its appreciation of spiritual
realities by separation from the world. It takes the law of
God as a reality, and; bringing its grand truths and inspiring
motives to bear directly upon the conduct of every day, works
by love."—"Bible in the Home," p. 115.
    4. A mere intellectual belief is not faith: It will save no
one. The fallen angels intellectually believe in God. They
know He exists. They have been in heaven. They know
something of His nature and majesty, though engaged in war-
fare against Him. Their belief does not lead them to re-
pentance. It terrifies them. They tremble at the knowledge
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                15

of the future which their belief reveals to them. Mari-y have
what might be termed an intellectual belief in, the existence
of God, and in the inspiration of the Word, yet continue in
sin. Real faith leads to a reformation of life, a surrendering
of all to God, manifested in a service of love.
    5. "There are many who fail to understand the relation
of faith and works. They say, 'Only believe in Christ, and
you are safe. You have nothing to do with keeping the law.'
But genuine faith will be manifest in obedience."-"Patri-
archs and Prophets," pp. 153, 154.

                             Notes
    1. The•plan of this epistle seems to be to call attention to
such things as especially needed to be corrected. Some of the
errors and improprieties that existed among the people have
been noticed in the previous chapter. Others are noticed in
this chapter.
    The Revised Version of this verse reads, "Be not many of
you teachers, my brethren, knowing that we shall receive
heavier judgment." "Evidently designed to censure the false
mania for teaching, the dogmatizing contentiousness which is
thoroughly characteristic of Judaizing Christians."— Lange.
    2. "He who truly masters his words will master his works."
    3. The Revised Version, margin, reads, "Behold, how great
a forest is kindled by how small a fire!" The figure is that of
a widespread conflagration kindled by the incendiary work
of an unruly, unsanctified tongue.
    4. "Setteth on fire the wheel of nature." R. V. This in-
dicates how an unbridled tongue can completely possess and
have a reflex influence on the soul, changing the whole course
of human life into a great fire wheel of destruction. "Set on
fire of hell." The word "hell" is not here translated from
the word hades, meaning the grave, but from gehenna. The
unsanctified, unruly tongue kindles in the family, in the
church, in the neighborhood, the flames of gehenna —"fire of
hell." We should individually take heed that we do not kindle
the first spark of this awful devastation.
    How often this "fire of hell" has been kindled in churches
and communities by the improper use of the tongue! Nothing
will drive the Holy Spirit from the life more effectually than
a wrong use of this unruly member. An unbridled, uncon-
secrated tongue may be a remorseless tool of Satan. There
is no more infamous instrument of evil than the tongue of
the gossiper, the tattler, the backbiter, and the slanderer.
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  17

There are many tearful eyes, broken hearts, ruined homes,
and blasted lives, as the result of the wrong use of the
tongue. Churches have been ruined and neighborhoods dis-
graced by busybodies and scandalmongers.

18          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

14. What comparison does Solomon make between a sound
      heart and one filled with envy? Prov. 14: 30.
15. What is said of the wisdom from above? James 3: 17.
16. How is the fruit of righteousness sown? By whom is it
     sown? Verse 18. Note 7.
                              Notes
    1. "These things ought not so to be." That is, they must
not be, they are not fitting.
    2. No fountain is both sweet and bitter. Be the stream
of impure water ever so small that comes into the fountain
of pure water through some opening or fissure in the rock,
the whole fountain is made impure. No such inconsistency is
found in nature as for a fountain to send forth both fresh
water and salt, and•none such should be found in the life of
any individual, especially a Christian.
    3. Four illustrations are given, showing the inconsistency
of living such a contradictory life: (a) a fountain; (b) a fig
tree • (c) a vine; (d) salt water. A fountain cannot produce
sweet water and bitter; a fig tree cannot produce olive berries;
a vine cannot bear figs; the sea cannot yield fresh water. Ac-
cording,to the ordinary operations of nature, these things are
impossible. All these illustrations are used to show the utter
impossibility of depravity and virtue dwelling in the same
heart, or of the love of God dwelling in the heart when hatred
and malice are cherished.
    4. Proud, haughty, disdainful, unholy persons may pass
for great scholars, and have the reputation of being very
learned; but such do not have true wisdom. This comes from
above, and is revealed in a holy life.
    5. That "the life is the light" is true of Christ's followers
also. We are epistles known and read of men. Our words
have but little weight unless they are emphasized by a con—
sistent life.
    6. "If ye be under the influence of an unkind, fierce, and
contemptuous spirit, even while attempting or pretending to
defend true religion, do not boast. . . . Ye have no religion,
and no true wisdom; and to profess either is to lie against the
truth."— Clarke.
    7. "Sown in peace." Fields are not sown with grain in the
tumult of a mob, or in a battle. Nothing is more peaceful
than a farmer going forth with measured tread to scatter
seed over his field. "The whole effect, therefore, of religion is
to produce peace. It is all peace — peace in the original, and
in its results; in the heart of the individual, and in society;
on earth, and in heaven."— Barnes.

      James 4: 8. Note 7.
                              Notes
    1. Hitherto the instruction and admonitions seem to have
been somewhat general. But now the application is made
more personal: "Whence come wars and fightings among you."
    "Not public or national wars, nor yet conflicts in the
courts, but rather quarrels growing out of their selfishness
and uncharitableness."— Clarke.
    2. "Ye have not, because ye ask not." One of the great
causes of all spiritual death, and strife in homes and churches,
is here pointed out. It is the lack of prayer.
   '3. "The general sense is: If you prayed aright, this feel-
ing of continued craving after more of worldly things would
not exist. All your proper wants would be supplied; and
these improper ones, which beget wars and fightings among
you, would not exist"— Alford.
    4. This world has its god. We cannot worship the God
of heaven and the god of this world. Those who bow before
the god of this world are truly the enemies of God.
    "How strange it is that people professing Christianity can
suppose that with a worldly spirit, worldly companions„ and
their lives governed by worldly maxims, they can be in favor
of God, or have a place in the kingdom of heaven! When the
world gets into the church, the church becomes a painted
sepulcher, its spiritual vitality being extinct."— Clarke.
    5. The Revised Version, margin, reads: "Or think ye that
the Scripture speaketh in vain? That Spirit which He made
to dwell in us yearneth for us even unto jealous envy." This
rendering contains a promise of the indwelling presence of
the Holy Spirit to resist envy.
    6. "The sure way to ,please God is to submit to the dis-
pensations of His grace and providence; and when a man
acknowledges Him in all his ways, He will direct all his steps.
The covetous man grasps at the shadow and loses the sub-
stance."— Clarke.
    7. "The heathen and the Jews were accustomed to wash
their hands before they engaged in public worship. The
particular idea here is, that in order to obtain the favor of
           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  21

God, it is necessary to put away our sins; to approach Him
with the purpose and desire to be pure and holy. The mere
washing of the hands, in itself, could not recommend us to
His favor; but that of which,the washing of the hands would
be an emblem would be accepted in His sight. It may be in-
ferred from what is said here that no one can hope for the
favor of God who does not abandon transgression."- Barnes!

those who through lack of Christian experience were guilty

repentance and humiliation of heart are demanded from those
who transgress the instruction of the Lord.
    2. "Mourners and penitents lay on the ground and rolled
themselves in the dust. When comforted and pardoned, they
arose from the earth, shook themselves from the dust, and
clothed themselves in their better garments. God promises to
raise men from the dust, when they are truly humbled."—
Clarke.
    3. ."There is nothing more decidedly condemned in the
Scriptures than the habit of pronouncing a judgment on the
motives and conduct of others. There is nothing in which we
are more liable to err, or to indulge in wrong feelings; and
there is nothing which God claims more for Himself as His
peculiar prerogative."— Barnes.
    4. Those who judge usurp the office and prerogative of
the supreme Judge. As God alone knows the heart and can
read the motives, He alone can be the Judge. Those, there-
fore, who assume to judge others, put themselves in the place
of God, which is the essence of papacy.
    5. Reference is here made, probably, to a custom of an-
cient times. People traded from city to city, carrying their
goods on their backs. Presumptuously planning concerning
the things of this life, while leaving God out of the reckon-
ing, and taking no account of the vicissitudes and uncertain-
ties of life, is rebuked. The evil of fixing a time to make a
journey, designating the period during which they would re-
main, and when they would return, without any reference to
God's will or purpose, is pointed out. This contains a search-
ing lesson for this time.

   6. The Revised Version reads: "What is your life? For
ye are a vapor that appeareth for a little time, and then
vanisheth away." Surely man, being but a vapor, has nothing
whereof to boast. How needful that he lay hold upon an en-
during substance!
   7. "Not only our doing depends on the will of the Lord,
but also, first of all, life itself."- Lange.

                               Notes
    1. "The term 'riches' •is to be taken . . . generically for
all kinds of property having a money value which is proverbi-
ally liable to loss or perishing."— Clarke.
    2. "A witness." "Their putrefied stores, moth-eaten gar-
ments, and tarnished coin are so many proofs that it was not
for want of property that they did not help the poor, but
through selfishness and avarice they defrauded the poor."
   " 'Eat your flesh as it were fire.' This is a very bold and
striking figure. He represents the rust of their coin as be-
coming a canker that should produce gangrenes and phage-
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                25




             "The hire of the laborers . . . crieth."

denous ulcers in their flesh, till it should be eaten away from
their bones."— Clarke.
    3. "And he doth not resist." The poor have no one to
plead their cause while they are groaning under the load of
injustice and oppression. But if they wait patiently, the
One into whose ears their cry has entered will give justice
and equity to all.
     4. The reference to the early and the latter rain has a
broader application. The early rain was the rain of the
seedtime, the latter rain was the rain of ripening for the
harvest. The first fell in Judea about November; the second,
toward the end of April, when the ears of grain were filling.
 Without these, the earth would have been unfruitful. In like
manner, the former rain of the Spirit fell at Pentecost to
water the seed. The latter rain is to fall to ripen the harvest
of the earth. We are to be patient until then.
     5. In the time of trial, we are not to grow impatient, and
 seek, as many do. to right wrongs by resorting to force and
 questionable methods; but we should look forward patiently
 to the time when Jesus will come and render a just reward
 to every man.
     6. "Groan not; grumble not; do not murmur through im-
 patience; and let not any ill treatment which you receive
 induce you to vent your feelings in imprecations against your
 oppressors. Leave all this in the hands of the Lord."— Clarke.

                          Questions

            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  27

14. How is this same comforting truth expressed by one of
        the prophets? Eze. 18: 23, 32.
                               •
                              Notes
    1. "The end of the Lord." The word "end" here means
object. There was a purpose in the trial and affliction of
Job. The Lord was working toward an end. It is even so
in the trials and afflictions that He permits to befall each of
us. In trial, we are to learn that the Lord is pitiful and com-
passionate.
    2. "Our Saviour did not, however, forbid the use of the
judicial oath, in which God is solemnly called to witness that
what is said is the truth, and nothing but the truth. Jesus
Himself, at His trial before the Sanhedrin, did not refuse to
testify under oath. The high priest said unto Him, 'I adjure
Thee by the living God, that Thou tell us whether Thou be
the Christ, the Son of God.' Jesus answered, 'Thou hast
said.' Had Christ, in the Sermon on the Mount, condemned
the judicial oath, He would at His trial have reproved the
high priest, and thus, for the benefit of His followers, have
enforced His own teaching."—"Mount of Blessing," p. 103.
    3. "The remedy is prayer; not necessarily to obtain the
reward of trial, but at any rate for the increase of faith, to
raise the spirits, so that we' be comforted and of good cheer."
—"Speaker's Commentary."
    4. "In the word of God we have instruction relative to
special prayer for the recovery of the sick. But the offering
of such prayer is a most solemn act, and should not be entered
upon without careful consideration. In many cases of prayer
for the healing of the sick, that which is called faith is noth-
 ing less than presumption."—"Ministry of Healing," p. 227.
    Read the entire chapter on this subject.
    5. "It is labor lost to teach people to look to God as a
healer of their infirmities, unless they are taught also to lay
aside unhealthful practices. In order to receive His blessing
 in answer to prayer, they must cease to do evil and learn to
 do well. Their surroundings must be sanitary, their habits
of life correct. They must live in harmony with the law of
 God, both natural and spiritual."— Id., pp. 227, 228.
     6. "If any who are seeking health have been guilty of evil
 speaking, if they have sowed discord in the home, the neigh-
 borhood, or the church, and have stirred up alienation and
 dissension, if by any wrong practice they have led others into
 sin, these things should be confessed before God and before
 those who have been offended."— Id., p. 229.
     7. It would be helpful, in the study of this lesson, to read
 carefully the story of Elijah's remarkable experience recorded
28         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

in 1 Kings, chapters 17, 18. We should remember that ,Elijah
was a man like ourselves, having the same passions and de-
sires; and what God did for him in answer to prayer, He is
able and willing to do for us, if we continue in prayer as
Elijah did.

      leaders among God's people? Ex. 18: 21.

      we belong? Ps. 24: 1; 50: 9-12; Haggai 2: 8.

      19: 13.

                               Notes
     1. "The greatest sin which now exists in the church is
covetousness. '—"Testimonies," vol. 1, p. 194.
     2. "I saw that anciently the covetousness of some led them
to withhold a suitable proportion; they made their offering
stinted. This was recorded in heaven, and they were cursed
in their harvest and their flocks just as they withheld. Some
were visited with affliction in their pmilies. God would not
accept a lame pffering."— Id., p. 221.
     3. "The word of God defines covetousness as idolatry. It
 is impossible for men and women to keep the law of God and
 love money. The heart's affections should be placed upon
 heavenly things. Our treasure should be laid up in heaven;
 for where our treasure is, there will our heart be also."— Id.,
 vol. 3, p. 130.
     4. "A concealed golden wedge and a Babylonish garment
 troubled the entire camp of Israel.. The frown of God was
 brought upon the people because of the sin of one man.
 Thousands were slain upon the field of battle because God
 would not bless and prosper a people among whom there was
 even one sinner, one who had transgressed His word."— Id.,
 p. 239.
     5. "I saw that many who profess to be keeping the com-
 mandments of God are appropriating to their own use the
 means which the Lord has intrusted to them, and which should
 come into His treasury. They rob God in tithes and in of-
 ferings. They dissemble, and withhold from Him to their
 own hurt. They bring leanness and poverty upon themselves-
 and darkness upon the church, because of their covetousness,
 their dissembling, and their robbing God in tithes and in
'offerings."— Id., p. 269.

Our Hearts and Treasure
                 Are in foreign missions. Some of
                 us have sons, daughters, or other
                 relatives, or personal acquaintances,
                 out at the front. Most of us are
                 giving generously of our means for
                 the carrying forward of the work
                 they are doing.
   Nothing else thrills like the mission stories that
are told to us. Did you ever notice how willing our
people are to remain overtime when Elder Spicer
tells of the experiences of our missionaries? Seems
as if we can't get enough. And so it should be.
   To read his new book, OUR STORY OF MIS-
SIONS, is almost like hearing him talk. Its 372
pages contain not only scores of incidents in connec-
tion with our own work in almost every country in
the world, but also chronicle the noble daring and
supreme sacrifices of those pioneers who blazed the
trail for the gospel and civilization. They do more.
They carry the reader back
to ancient Israel, to apostolic
times, and on down' the cen-
turies to the Reformation, to
show God's plan of making
Himself known through His
witnesses.
