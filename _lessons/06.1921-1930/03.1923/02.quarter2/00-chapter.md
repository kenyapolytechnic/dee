                              Notes
     1. The expression in the first verse, "strangers scattered,"
 is in the Revised Version "sojourners of the dispersion," and
it is thought by many to refer to Israel according to the flesh;
 but while believing Jews are doubtless,included, evidently the
 epistle is addressed, and comes with peculiar force, to gentile
believers. See chapter 2: 10. As we proceed in the study of
 these lessons, we shall see that though this epistle has been a
blessing to the church through all the past, it has special ap-
plication and force in the last days. See chapter 1: 13; 4: 7,
12, 13, 17.
     2. The elect of God primarily is Christ Himself (Isa.
42: 1), and all those who are Christ's are therefore also the
elect of God. They are chosen "before the foundation of the
world" (Eph. 1: 4), "according to the foreknowledge of God"
 (1 Peter 1: 2), chosen to be "holy and without blame" (Eph.
1:4), chosen to salvation (2 Thess. 2:13; 2 Tim. 2:10),
chosen through the belief of the truth, the sanctification of
the Spirit, and the "sprinkling of the blood of Jesus" (2 Thess.
2: 13; 1 Peter 1:2).
     When we choose what God chooses, and as long as we con-
tinue so to / choose, our election is sure. That this election is
not unconditional, but dependent on man's choice, is clearly
shown by the fact that it is through sanctification of the Spirit
unto obedience. That is, only those who yield to the convicting,
sanctifying power of God's Spirit, even to a life of obedience
to God, are elect, according to the foreknowledge of God.
     3. Faith is based upon God's word. God says it; faith
says it is so, and so it is. Hope is based on God's promise.
The one all-embracing promise of God is that relating to the
Seed, Jesus Christ. (See Gen. 3: 15; 13: 16; 22: 17, 18; and
other passages.) This hope centers in Christ, His death and
resurrection. To this, Paul refers as "the hope of the promise
made of God unto our fathers." Acts 26: 6. This hope in-
cluded the resurrection of the dead (verse 8; 24: 15) ; it was
"the hope of Israel" (28: 20) ; it is the hope of the Lord's
coming (Titus 2: 13), of eternal life (3: 7), of salvation (1
Thess. 5: 8), of the incorruptible inheritance (1 Peter 1: 4) ;
it is the hope of the gospel (Col. 1: 23), Christ our hope (1
Tim. 1:1), "Christ in you, the hope of glory" (Col. 1:27).
We are begotten again unto that hope by the word of the gos-
pel (1 Peter 1: 23; James 1:18) ; but that word of the gospel
is the living Word, our Lord Jesus Christ, who demonstrated
His power over sin and death by His resurrection (Acts
2: 24). This hope in Christ is therefore "a living hope,"
ever growing brighter, bigger, stronger, as we appropriate
the living Word.

    4. Trial of Your Faith.— Every day brings its trials of
faith, every temptation puts faith to the teat; but to him who
has genuine faith, there is never any more danger of faith's
failing under one test than under another. It matters not
how great the test; power sufficient for every need awaits
faith. It is not a matter of the strength of the person tempted,
nor of the strength of the temptation brought; it is a matter
of simple faith in Christ. Faith puts Christ in our place, and
Christ is as able to meet all the armies of Satan. as He is to
meet the weakest foe. He who thus endures temptation proves
in every trial that his faith is genuine — a precious experience
indeed here, but more precious when found unto praise and
glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
    5. Love.— Faith begets love by continually proving God
to be what He is. The Christian therefore knows Christ,
though having never seen Him. Faith has brought Him into
the heart (Eph. 3: 17), put Him into the life (Gal. 2: 20),
and proved Him to be love in all places, under all circum-
stances; and the soul loves Him with an ever-growing love.
Again, the Spirit of God is given to those who ask in faith
 (Luke 11: 9-13; Gal. 3: 14), and to the sons of God (Gal.
4: 6) ; and by that Spirit, "the love of God is shed abroad in
our hearts" (Rom. 5: 5).

                              Notes
     1. Have Inquired.— The holy men of old certainly knew the
salvation of Christ personally. (See Gen. 49: 18; Ex. 15: 2;
 Ps. 9: 14; 51: 12.) In fact, the whole inspired psalmody of
Israel breathes of the salvation of God, both present and fu-
ture. Yet they did not understand the plan of salvation in
its fuller development, as did and do those of the Christian
era. This is expressly declared in the Scripture (1 Peter
1: 12), by the prophets themselves (Dan. 12: 4, 9), by Christ
 (Matt. 13: 16, 17), by the apostles (Rom. 16: 25, 26; Eph.
3: 5) • but this understanding was not necessary, for God, by
His gpirit, spoke through the prophets things which they did
not know nor understand. They were the instruments; it
was the Spirit of Christ which was in them that testified, not
the prophets themselves. The Spirit of God knows the mind
and thoughts of God (1 Cor. 2: 11) , and therefore it was
necessary that the Spirit of God should convey the thoughts
of God to future generations (2 Sam. 23: 2; see also 1 Cor.
2: 13; 2 Tim. 3: 16).
    2. A true prophet, when speaking for God, does not ex-
press his own thoughts. His testimony does not originate
with himself, but comes from One higher, for whom he speaks.
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   7

After giving the message, he must in turn apply his mind
to understand its meaning fully; for this could in no wise be
guaranteed simply because he had been chosen as a vehicle to
convey it.
    3. The Revised Version gives a thought in the rendering
of this verse which ought to be considered in its study; it
reads, "Wherefore girding up the loins of your mind, be sober
and set your hope perfectly on the grace that is being brought
[margin] unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ." Note,
the girding is not a single act, but a constant work, a binding
up with the truth of God (E.ph. 6: 14), as that truth is con-
stantly revealed in the onward path of the Christian (Phil.
3: 15, 16). And note also that this grace is not all future, but
is constantly flowing from a full fountain to which we have
access by faith (Rom. 5: 2), as Christ is revealed to us more
and more in His word; for to the faithful Christian student
of the word are constantly revealed new manifestations of the
glory of the Master (2 Cor. 4: 6), which will increase "from
glory to glory" (2 Cor. 3: 18), until the day of the revealing
of the glory. of His presence (2 Thess. 1: 7, 10; 2: 8), when
His people shall be made like Him (Phil. 3:20, 21; 1
John 3: 2).
    4. Be Ye Holy.— The Revised Version puts the expression
as both a command and a declaration: "Like as He which
called you is holy, be ye yourselves also holy in all manner of
living; because it is written, Ye shall be holy; for I am holy."
See Lev. 19: 2. God commands things impossible for us in
and of ourselves. He says, "Be ye holy;" but of ourselves we
have no holiness about us. "We are all as an unclean thing,
and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags" (Isa. 64: 6) ;
but He who called us is holy, and as He called us in our
 uncleanness to holiness (1 Thess. 4: 7; Eph. 1: 4), Christ
sanctified or made holy Himself, that we might be holy (John
17: 19), and to those who submit to Him, He gives a new heart
and a new spirit, cleansing them from all their pollution (Eze.
36: 25-27). They are "created in righteousness and true holi-
ness" (Eph. 4: 24) ; and being made free from the power of
sin, they have, by- God's grace, "fruit unto holiness, and the
end everlasting life" (Rom. 6: 22). So the expression, "Ye
shall be holy; for I am holy," is a pledge of God's holiness and
power that, if we will but submit to Him, we shall be estab-
lished "unblamable in holiness before God, even our Father,
at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ" (1 Thess. 3: 13).
 Our part is to submit to God's plan, to yield to His holy con-
ditions; God, by. the Spirit of holiness and His word, does the
work.

             SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    9

16. By what means is the word made known to others ? Verse
          25, last part.
                               Notes _
      1. "The more joy in Christ any man has, the more will he
 be afraid of not conforming sufficiently to Christ. Fear is in-
 separable from earnestness of purpose. It accompanies all
 the nobler feelings. If you love, you fear; if you strive and
 aspire, you fe-ar. Whatever may be one's estimate of the
 fear of judgment, all must recognize the nobility of the fear
 that springs from thinking of the greatness of redemption.
 This fear is only possible to men who have spiritual sight,
  tender conscience, and gratitude."— J. Leckie, in "The Ser-
• mon Bible."'
       2. Conversation.— This word, found in verse 15 of the last
  lesson, and verse 18 of this (see also 2: 12; 3: 1, 2), means
  the whole course of conduct, manner of life, behavior. See
 the Revised Version. This is what "conversation" meant in
  English when the Bible was translated, and the word is so
  used now in some instances, but in most cases is applied to
  common talking among persons. Let the student understand
  that, while it is not confined to speech, it includes this as a
  part of the "manner of life." From the vain worldly manner
 of life, God has redeemed us to a new manner of life, even
  His own.
       3. Purified in Obeying the Truth.— This text is a parallel
  to Acts 15: 9, "purifying their hearts by faith." The faith is
  faith in the cleansing, purifying word (John 15: 3) ; the
  obedience is the obedience of faith (Rom. 16: 26) to the word
  or truth of the gospel. The cleansing power in the word is
  the Spirit of God. Compare with 1 Peter 1: 2; 2 Thess. 2: 13.
       4. "The apostle's words were written for the instruction of
  believers in every age, and they have a special significance for
  those who live at the time when the 'end of all things is at
  hand.' His exhortations and warnings, and his words of faith
  and courage, are needed by every soul who would maintain
  his faith 'steadfast unto the end.'
       "The apostle sought to teach the believers how important
  it.is to keep thc mind from wandering to forbidden themes,
   or from spending its energies on trifling subjects. Those
  who would not fall a prey to Satan's devices, must guard well
  the avenues of the soul; they must avoid reading, seeing, or
  hearing that which will suggest impure thoughts. The mind
   must not be left to dwell at random upon every subject that
  the enemy of souls may suggest. The heart must be faithfully
  sentineled, or evils without will awaken evils within, and the
  soul will wander in darkness."—"The Acts of the Apostles,"
   p. 518.
10            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

    5. "Since we are grass and live a brief day of years, what
is the use of so much anxious care, of so much fretting and
fussing? What is the good of hoarding money for other
people to ruin themselves with when you are dead? What is
the good of hating your neighbor? What is the sense of try-
ing to act a part, of seeming other than we are, of being
hypocrites? What is the gain of guile, or envy, or evil
speaking? Let us think no evil, and do no wrong; for this is
the word of the Lord that endureth forever: that ajl bitterness
and wrath, that all anger and clamor, that all evil speaking,
that all malice, be nut away from you. And let us be kind one
to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God
for Christ's sake hath forgiven us. Then, since I am grass,
and disease is in the air, and I die to-morrow, I will have no
dealings with malice, or hate, or envies; I will chide nobody
in the world except myself, against whom I know most faults.
And that is the moral. If all flesh is grass, let us remember
it: no grudge, no guile, no hate, no evil speaking, but to love
one another."— J. R. Paxton, in "The Sermon Bible."

                               Notes
     1. "The habit of backbiting, gosSip, ungenerous criticism
. . . reveals a lack of culture and refinement and of true good-
ness of heart; it unfits one both for the society of the truly
cultured and refined in this world, and for association with the
holy ones of heaven. We think with horror of the cannibal
who feasts on the still warm and trembling flesh of his victim;
but are the results of even this practice more terrible than are
the agony and ruin caused by misrepresenting motive, black-
ening reputation, dissecting character?"—"Education," p. 235.
     "Nothing else in this world is so dear to God as His church.
Nothing is guarded by Him with such jealous care. Nothing
so offends God as an act that injures the influence of those
who are doing His service. He will call to account all who,
aid Satan in his work of ,criticizing and discouraging."—
"Testimonies," vol. 6, p. 42.
     "An earnest effort should be made in every church to put
away evil speaking and a censorious spirit as among the sins
productive of the greatest evils in the church. Severity and
faultfinding must be rebuked as the workings of Satan."—
Id., vol. 5, p. 609.
      2. "Christ is represented by the chief corner stone. Jew
and gentile must build upon this foundation, and their con-
 nection with Christ, this 'precious stone' makes them living
stones."—"Spirit of Prophecy," vol. 3, p. 38.
      "Many persons are hewn, polished and beautified by their
 own endeavors, but they never will become 'living stones' be-
cause they are not connected with Christ. When the rain
falls, and the tempest rages, and the floods come they will
 fall in ruin because they are not riveted to the eternal rock,
the chief corner stone, Christ Jesus."— Id., P. 40.
12           SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

     3. Lively Stones.— Better, "living stones." The child of
God is ever represented by something which has life and im-
plies action. He is the soldier on duty (Eph. 6: 13), the
contender in the games (1 Cor. 9: 24), the pilgrim traveler
  (Heb. 11: 13), a living branch of the True Vine (John 15: 5) ;
he is to grow (Eph. 4: 15), to walk (Eph. 4: 1), to run (Heb.
12: 1), to fight the fight of faith (1 Tim. 6: 12), to watch, to
 work, etc.; 'and when an inanimate object like a stone is taken
to represent the Christian, life is imputed to that object.
This life comes from Christ, the living Rock, on which be-
 lievers as stones are built, receiving life from the foundation,
Christ (1 Cor. 3: 11; Gal. 2: 20). They thus become welded
or grown to the rock, connected with the one life. The object
of this building is said to be to offer up spiritual sacrifices
acceptable to God. All that makes anything acceptable to
 God is that Christ shall be in it; and if Christ is in us, and we
are in Him, the praises and prayers of His people, the sac-
 rifices for His sake, their labors of love, in fact, the very life,
are all acceptable in the Beloved. (See Mal. 1: 11; Rom.
12:1; Heb. 13:15, 16.)
     4. "The stones were not prepared for their respective places
just as they were about to be laid in the wall of the temple;
all the fitting and planning was done previous to their being
brought to the place of building. So it is that all the hewing,
fitting and polishing of character must be done during man's
probation. . . . Earth is the quarry and the workshop where
men are to be fitted and refined for the courts of heaven. As
the stones composing Solomon's temple came together in the
 wall a perfect fit, without the touch of ax or hammer or
any other instrument, so will the resurrected saints, and those
who are alive at the time of His coming be caught up together
to meet the Lord in the air, each one fitted for the great
change and taking his proper place in the temple of God's
 love."—"Spirit of Prophecy," vol. 3, pp. 40, 41.
     5. To the believer, Christ is the precious foundation. To
the unbeliever, or disobedient (for the terms are synonymous
— see Revised Version), He is a stone of stumbling. The
same sun and rain .which ripen and develop the wheat, also
ripen and develop the tares and the weeds. The latter class
stumble because they will not obey; they do not wish to do
God's will. "Who is wise, and he shall understand these
things? prudent, and he shall know them? for the ways of
the Lord are right, and the just shall walk in them: but the
transgressors shall fall therein." Hosea 14: 9. The earnest
student of prophecy will find added interest in this lesson by a
diligent study of Isa. 28: 14-22. This scripture comes with
especial force to those living in the last days. When God's
 judgments sweep away the refuge of lies, and the house
              SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                13

built on the sand is overthrown, blessed indeed will those
be who have "digged deep," and laid their foundation on the
Rock Christ Jesus. Luke 6: 47-49.
   6. We are not to understand, from the closing words of
verse 8, that certain persons are foreordained to disobedience
and death, but that those who choose sin instead of right-
eousness are appointed to destruction. It is character that
is chosen, and not individuals. Those who partake of• the
character of Christ will be saved; those who reject His right-
eousness will be lost.

        will be the result? 1 Peter 2: 15.
12. In what way should this obedience be rendered? Verse 16.
        Note 5.
                                Notes
    1. "Evil angels are commissioned to employ men as their
agents upon the earth. These can the most successfully exert
an influence to make Satan's attacks effective against the
remnant whom God calls 'a chosen generation, a royal priest-
hood, a holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should show
forth the praises of Him who hath called you out of darkness
into His marvelous light.' This, Satan is determined to hinder.
He will employ everyone who will engage in his service to
hinder the chosen people of God from showing forth the praises
of Him who has called them from darkness into His marvelous
light. To hide, to cover up this light, to cause people to dis-
trust it, to disbelieve it, is the work of the great rebel and his
 host."—"Testimonies," vol. 2, p. 105.
    2. "Fleshly Lusts."— We are exhorted as strangers and
pilgrims to abstain from fleshly -lusts. They consist of the
sinful desires and longings of the carnal, unrenewed mind
and heart. Selfish gratification of the appetites and passions
is to be denied, not indulged. Every power of the mind and
body should be consecrated to God and His service, and not
perverted and weakened by indulgence. We are not our own,
because we have been bought with the precious blood of Christ;
hence whether we eat or drink, or whatsoever we do, we should
 do all to the glory of God. 1 Cor. 6: 19, 20; 10: 31. We do
not glorify God in our bodies and spirits, which are His,
when we seek carnal pleasures and selfish gratification. These
fleshly lusts war against the soul; that is, when we indulge
them, we injure our spiritual natures, we weaken our moral
powers, and defile ourselves with. sin. Hence we are exhorted
to abstain from them.
    3. When rulers enact unwise or oppressive laws, they are
frequently spoken of with disrespect and contempt by the
people. Such examples often become contagious; but Chris-
tians should not allow themselves to be carried away by these
bad examples; and all laws, needless and oppressive though
 they may be, should be obeyed with faithfulness unless they
contravene God's law. In such case only may we refuse
to obey.
    4. All expressions like these in our lesson pertain to proper
laws, and to such only as rulers have a right to make. "Ren-
der to Cmsar the things that are Cwsar's, and to God the
things that are God's." To God belongs everything which
pertains to His worship or service as commanded in His word
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  15

or conceived by the conscience. The civil duties, between man
and man, and the duty of man to support the state, are dis-
tinct from the duties which pertain to religion. Daniel was
prime minister in an idolatrous empire, and was obedient to
all civil laws, but. he could not obey a law which would compel
him to dishonor God. Dan. 6: 4-23. The three young He-
brews, high in position, faithful in all civil duties, could not
do otherwise than refuse to dishonor God by obeying the king's
command to bow down before the golden image. Dan. 3: 8-18.
See also Acts 4: 19 and 5: 29. The matter of obedience to
laws which deny, or dishonor God is not a matter of "will not"
or "would not," but of "cannot" and "could not." The Chris-
tian would die rather than dishonor God.
     5. "The true Christian is the only man who is free upon
earth, because he will never desire to do more than God's law
permits him, and that, indeed, is glorious liberty. There is
no such freedom as serving God."-"The Sermon Bible,"
vol. 12, p. 42.

15. What relationship does Christ sustain to every obedient
       child of God? Verse 25.
                             Notes
    1. The practical duties enjoined in this lesson are those
which are very likely to be overlooked. "Honor 411 men."
"Some are not worthy of honor," says one; neither are we.
We are by nature the same as they (Eph. 2: 3) ; all were
made originally in the likeness of God as much as we (James
3: 9) ; all are bought by the same precious blood. of Christ
(1 Tim. 2: 6) ; all are therefore for Christ's sake entitled to
esteem and honor.
    2. Love the Brotherhood.— A closer, deeper affection than
that which we cherish for all men, for we are bound, together
by the life and presence of Christ (John 17: 23).
    3. Fear God.— The fear of the Lord, not cringing or slRv-
ish fear, but loving reverence, is the foundation of wisdom.
He who knows God most, fears and loves Him most.
    4. Honor the King.— Under God he is your ruler; honor his
office and respect his authority. See 1 Peter 2: 14, 15.
    5. Servants.— We are all servants, servants of God and
the Lord Jesus Christ. He was misunderstood, unappreciated,
scorned, maligned, crucified; so will we be. Let us do our
work faithfully wherever we labor, with all fear of God, not
with eyeservice,as men pleasers, but as doing service to God,
and not to man. Eph. 6: 5-7. A bad servant will many times
be patient under a gentle master; but only the servant who is
loyal to God will be patient and true under the froward
master. If he maintains this spirit for Christ's sake, of
Christ will- he receive the reward. We are called thus to
suffer and deny ourselves. See Matt. 16: 24; Acts 14: 22 ;
2 Tim. 3: 12.
    6. "Not in freedom from trial, but in the midst of it, is
Christian character developed. Exposure to rebuffs and op-
             SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                 17

position leads the follower of Christ to greater watchfulness,
and more earnest prayer to the mighty Helper. Severe trial
endured by the grace of God develops patience, vigilance, for-
titude, and a deep and abiding trust in God. It is the triumph
of the Christian faith that it enables its follower to suffer
and be strong; to submit, and thus to conquer; 10.be killed
all the day long, and yet to live; to bear the cross, and thus
 to win the crown of glory."—"Acts of the Apostles," pp..
467, 468.
    7. "Stars shine brightest in the darkest night; torches are
the better for beating; grapes come not to the proof till they
come to the press; spices smell sweetest when pounded; young
trees root the faster for shaking; . . . gold looks the brighter
for scouring; gloWworms glisten best in the dark; juniper
smells sweetest in the fire; pomander becomes most fragrant
for chasing; the palm tree proves the better for pressing;
camomile, the more you tread it, the more you spread it.
Such is the condition of all God's children': they are the most
triumphant when most tempted, most glorious when most af-
flicted, most in the favor of God when least in man's; as their
conflicts, so their conquests; as their tribulations, so their
triumphs."— Spencer.

14. What instructions are given to him who loves life and
      good days ? Verses 10,11.
                             Notes
    1. Wives and Husbands.— Such instructions as are here
given are frequently laughed at or sneered about even by those
who profess the name of Christ. An unwise, overbearing
husband has pressed them too far, or an obstinate, self-willed,
worldly-minded wife has rebelled against them; but it is well
to remember that these words are the words of God, to be
listened to or studied with reverence, and that we must meet
them in the judgment. Subjection to a husband does not mean
slavish homage, but the simple respect due to him whom God
and nature have placed first as head and protector of the
family. The very name husband — house-band — indicates a
binding together, not a lording over. Husbands should love
their wives as their own selves (Eph. 5: 25, 28), and should
not be bitter against them (Col. 3: 19), but dwell with them
according to the knowledge revealed in the word of God,
giving them honor (1) because they are the weaker sex, (2)
because they are heirs together of the grace of life. Wives are
to submit to their husbands as is fit in the Lord (Col. 3: 18);
to defer to them in matters that do not violate conscience or
cause the wife to dishonor God, never disparaging them in the
eyes of their children or others. She should be modest, pru-
dent, economical. If these virtues appear, and affection ex-
ists,'God will be honored, and the united prayers of husband
and wife put up to Him for their children and various needed
blessings will not be hindered.
             SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                19

   2. Of One Mind.- The only way to be of one mind is to
have the mind of Christ (Phil. 2: 5). This mind will take
possession of us when we fully renounce self and let Christ in.
This unites us with Christ, and through Christ with one an-
other (John 17: 21-23). Union of each soul with God is the
only way possible to have union with one another.

14. What assurance do we have that Christ is able to save
      us from all that can come upon us? Verse 22.
                              Notes
    1. Who Is He That Will Harm You? — Even though we
suffer persecution for righteousness' sake, that will not work
to our ultimate harm, though it causes present sufferings; for
10. them that love God, all things work together for good.
Even in the greatest sufferings, His followers are, through the
love of God, more than conquerors. See Rom. 8: 28, 37. In
the very sufferings, then, they may find happiness and rejoice.
See also Matt. 5: 11, 12.
    2. "The followers of Christ know little of the plots which
Satan and his hosts are forming against them. But He who
sitteth in the heavens will overrule all these devices for the
accomplishment of His deep designs. The Lord permits His
people to be subjected to the fiery ordeal of temptation, not
because He takes pleasure in their distress and affliction, but
because this process is essential to their final victory. He
could not, consistently with His own glory, shield them from
temptation; for the very object of the trial is to prepare them
to resist all the allurements of evil."—"The Great Contro-
versy," pp. 528, 529.
    3. The Revised Version makes the latter part of verse 14
and the first part of verse 15 almost identical with the latter
part of Isa. 8: 12 and the first part of verse 13. Isaiah says:
"Neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid. Sanctify the Lord
of hosts Himself." Peter says: "Fear not their fear, neither
be troubled; but sanctify in your hearts Christ as Lord."
Isaiah tells us in the next verse what the Lord will be to those
who trust in Him. "He shall be for a sanctuary," a safe and
holy place; for in the time of trouble, God will spread over us
the pavilion of His power (Ps. '27: 5; 34: 7), and hide us
under the shadow of His wings (Ps. 17: 8), in the secret place
of His tabernacle (Ps, 27: 5).
    4. "Trial is part of the education given in the school of
Christ, to purify God's children from the dross of earthliness.
It is because God is leading His children, that trying ex-
periences come to them. Trials and obstacles are His chosen
methods of discipline, and His appointed conditions of success.
He who reads the hearts of men knows their weaknesses better
than they themselves can know them. He sees that some have
qualifications which, if rightly directed, could be used in the
advancement of His work. In His providence He brings these
              SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                21

souls into different positions and varied circumstances, that
they may discover the defects that are concealed front their
own knowledge. He gives them opportunity to overcome
these defects, and to fit themselves for service. Often He
permits the fires of affliction to burn, that they may be puri-
fied. God's care for His heritage is unceasing. He suffers
no affliction to come upon His children but such as is essential
for their present and eternal good."—"Acts of the Apostles,"
 p. 524.
     5. The "spirits" referred to by Peter, to whom Christ
preached, were the people living in the days of Noah; while
-the ark was preparing. The prison referred to was not a
literal prison of cells and iron bars, but a condition far worse
— a bondage of soul brought about through their disobedience.
 Read Gal. 3:22, 23 and Isa. 61: 1.
     Noah was the actual preacher, a preacher of righteousness;
but he was controlled by the Spirit of God, which Spirit, Peter
declares, raised Jesus from the dead.

                              Notes
     1. Suffered in the Flesh.— Christ took upon Himself the
infirmities and sins of the flesh (Heb. 2: 14; 4: 15; 2 Cor.
5: 21) ; but to every sin He died, every lust He crucified, every
selfish desire He denied Himself — and all for our sakes. We
are to reckon ourselves dead unto sin (Rom. 6: 11), to put to
death the passions and sins of the flesh (Rom. 8: 12, 13; Gal.
 . 24), to deny ourselves (Matt. 16: 24), to renounce all and
5:
follow Him (Luke 14: 33). Thus dying to sin, in Christ
we cease from sin and live unto God. Rom. 7: 4. And surely
is not the time past of our life sufficient for indulgence in
all these sins and lusts? Christ will take them all away,
and put in their place His own righteousness.
     2. The Spirit of Christ is given to every child of His
 (Rom. 8: 9) ; and the gift of preaching is bestowed through
it (1 Cor. 12: 4). Through that Spirit, Christ has always
ministered to the souls in the prison house of sin (Isa. 61: 1;
Ps. 51: 12, 13). In the days of Noah, that Spirit spoke
through the patriarch (2 Peter 2: 5), who by faith preached
the message and saved his house (Heb. 11: 7). As Noah by
faith did what God enjoined, so we by baptism .show our
faith in the death and resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ.
It is not the baptism that saves, but faith in the resurrection
of Jesus Christ. Baptism is the manifestation of our faith,
even as the baptism of 'Noah in the ark by the Deluge was
the manifestation of his faith in the power of God. It is not
the mere act that saves, not the physical washing, but faith in
a risen Redeemer, which cleanses the conscience of its dead
works.
     3. "The end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore
sober, and watch unto prayer.' We' are not only required
to pray, but to guard the words and actions, and even the
thoughts,— to 'watch unto prayer.' If the mind is centefed
upon heavenly things, the conversation will run in the same
channel. The heart will overflow at the contemplation of the
Christian's hope, the exceeding great and precious promises
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   23

left on record for our encouragement; and our rejoicing in
view of the mercy and goodness of God need not be repressed;
it is a joy that no man can take from us. During the wak-
ing hours, the mind will be constantly employed. If it dwells
upon unimportant matters, the intellect is dwarfed and
weakened. There may be some spasmodic flashes of thought,
but the mind is not disciplined to steady, sober reflection.
There' are themes- that demand serious consideration. They
are those of the great plan of redemption, which is soon to be
finished. Jesus is about to be revealed in the clouds of
heaven, and what manner, of characters must we have, to
enable us to stand in that day?"—"Gospel Workers," old edi-
tion, p. 419.
     4. The apostle does not teach here that charity is to excuse
and cover up the sins we should confess to God and our fellow
men and put away from us. It will help us to look for the
good, the desirable, the commendable in others rather than
 their mistakes and defects. If you have knowledge of any-
thing that would damage or bring suspicion upon the charac-
 ter of another, keep it as a sacred trust. Do not divulge -
it unless your silence would directly involve you in a wrong.
 Even after you have told the offender of his wrong, you
should not feel at liberty to advertise his defects to others.
 You cannot ascend to honor and influence by using the de-
 fects in others as a scaffolding upon which to climb. Make it
 a ruling principle to bring to the fore a person's good quail-
;ties. If a fault is noticed, search for and mention the extenu-
 ating circumstances, the possible causes for failure. Make
 it a point to search for these; for they are in the lives of the
 most imperfect. Be quick to discern some generous construc-
 tion to put upon the fault, or mention some consideration to
 weigh in the opposite scale. "True, he was unpardonably
 dull and slow; but then, how trustworthy and reliable!" "Yes,
 he was irritable and abrupt; but remember what a strain he
 has been under lately, not leaving his office until late at night,
 and returning early every morning, with no let-up of the.busi-
 ness pressure." -"Are you sure there is not some other
 explanation possible for his action?" In some such ways as
 these, Christian love argues with itself and others; and as
 the result, many a sin is hindered on its way, and many a
 fault condoned. True charity rebukes with great • tender-'
 ness. There are cases where duty demands severe treatment.
  The sore must not go unlanced, lest it spread infection and
  death to the whole body; but the lancing is done with ex-
 quisite tenderness. The wrongdoer is reproved, rebuked, and
 exhorted, but with all long-suffering. 2 Tim. 4: 2. The man
  overtaken in a fault is restored in the spirit of meekness.
  Gal. 6: 1.

  11. To how many and by whose choice are these gifts be-
         stowed ? 1 Cor. 12: 11.
                              Notes
      1. "The privilege granted Abraham and Lot is not denied
  to us. By showing hospitality to God's children we, too, may
  receive His angels into our dwellings. Even in our day,
  angels in human form enter the homes of men and are en-
  tertained by them. And Christians who live in the light .of
  God's countenance are always accompanied by unseen angels,
  and these holy beings leave behind them a blessing in our
  homes. . . . Christ keeps an account of every expense in- '
  curred in entertaining for Hip sake. He supplies all that is
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                  25

necessary for this work. Those who for Christ's sake enter-
tain their brethren, doing their best to make the visit profit-
able„both to their guests and to themselves, are recorded in
heaven as worthy of special blessings."—"Testimonies," vol.
6, pp. 342, 344, 345.
    2. "But not to any class is Christ's love restricted. He
identifies Himself with every child of humanity. That we
might become members of the heavenly family, He became a
member of the earthly family. He is the Son of man, and thus
a brother to every son and daughter of Adam. His followers
are not to feel themselves detached from the perishing world
around them. They are a part of the great web of humanity;
and Heaven looks upon them as brothers to sinners as well as
to saints. The fallen, the erring, and the sinful, Christ's
love embraces; and every deed of kindness done to uplift a
fallen soul, every act of mercy, is accepted as done to Him."
—"Desire of Ages," p. 638.
    3. The Revised Version of 1 Peter 4: 10 reads, "According
as each hath received a gift, ministering it among yourselves,
as good stewards of the manifold grace of God." God's grace
is here said to be manifold, because manifested in so many
ways in the church of God, even as the raindrops separate
the light into the glorious colors of the rainbow. This grace
comes through the gracious Spirit of God (Eph. 4: 7; 1 Cor.
12: 4) ; these gifts of God's Spirit are given to everyone who
is Christ's (Rom. 8: 9), to profit, or increase (1 Cor. 12: 7),
 divided not according to the will of the man, but the wisdom
of the Spirit (verse 11) ; these gifts were bestowed upon the
 church when Jesus left this world (Eph. 4: 8), for the per-
fecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the
 building up of the body, or church, of Christ (verse 12) ; and
 these gifts will continue, according to the measure of faith
 and consecration of the church, till the perfect day, or till
 Christ comes (1 Cor.. 13: 8-10; Eph. 4: 13). Some of these
 gifts are mentioned in Rom. 12: 6-8; 1 Cor. 12: 8-10, 28; Eph.
4: 11.
     4. "The Lord calls for every talent and ability to be put
 to use. When the reproach of indolence and slothfulness shall
 have been wiped away from the church, the Spirit of the
 Lord will be graciously manifested; divine power will com-
 bine with human effort; the church will see the providential
 interpositions of the Lord God of hosts, the light of truth will
 be diffused, the knowledge of God and of Jesus ,Christ whom
 He has sent."— Mrs. E. G. White, in "Conference Bulletin,"
1893, p. 420.

                             Notes
    1. The Fiery Trial.- Trials are, a part of our heritage;
for "hereunto were ye called" (1 Peter 2: 21). The last days
will be especially perilous (2 Tim. 3: 1) ; every wind of doc-
trine will be blowing (Eph. 4: 14) ; men will put darkness for
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   27

light, and light for darkness (La. 5: 20) ,•' false prophets will
do great signs and wonderg, to deceive, if possible, the elect
of God (Mark 13: 22) ; Satan himself will appear as an angel
of light, and his ministers as ministers of righteousness (2
Cor. 11: 14, 15) ; persecution will break forth upon those who
honor God's law in the gospel of Christ (Rev. 12: 17; 13: 11-
17) ; Satan will work with all power and signs and lying
wonders (2 Thess. 2: 9-12) ; in short, every delusion of the
past, every device of the devil adapted for the present, a
very flood of iniquity and persecution, will roll in upon the
world and the people of God in these days of peril, culminat-
ing in the hour of temptation such as the world has never
before seen (Rev. 3: 10). These are the perils.
    2. On the other hand, the Lord Jesus Christ, who con-
quered Satan, has promised, "Lo, I am with you alway, even
unto the end of the world." He has given His precious truth
to meet all the wiles of the adversary (2 Thess. 2: 10-12) ;
He has promised that when the enemy shall come in like a flood,
the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him
 (Isa. 59: 19) ; God will keep His people in the hour of temp-
tation which is coming on all the world to try those who dwell
on the earth (Rev. 3: 10).
    3. "There is a fellowship of Christ's sufferings in re-
lation to pain. The pains of life, inward and outward, are
as varied as the bodies and souls on which they fasten. Our
sensibilities to pain are very various: one thing hurts one
person, and another another; that which is agony to me my
neighbor scarcely feels. This is true of the roughnesses of
life, and it is true of the calumnies of life, and it is true of
the disappointments of life; it is true of those trials which
come to us through the affections, and it is true of those
trials which come to us through the ambitions of our nature.
Thus much we may say with certainty: that no man, and
therefore no Christian, passes through life untouched by
distress. The cause may vary, and the kind may vary, and
the degree may vary, all but infinitely ; still the fact is there,
the thing is there; the experience must be gained, as alone it
can be gained, through suffering; and oftentimes the even
tenor of an untroubled life, in its brightest and serenest
day, is but the torrent's smoothness ere it dash below. . . .
    "There is a fellowship of ,Christ's sufferings in relation to
sin. As He resisted unto blood, striving against sin, so must
we. It is a life-and-death battle for each one of us. We shall
never have done with it for long together while life lasts.
 Sometimes by craft and sometimes by assault, sometimes by
ambush, sometimes by feigned flight, sometimes with parade
of arms and trumpets, as though secure of intimidation and
of triumph, the old enemy attacks again, the old sin rises
28             SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

from its fall, and there is nothing before us yet once more
save hard-earned victory or shameful defeat. In the midst
of all, let this be our stay: 'Greater is He that is with us,
than he that is in the world.' "- C. J. Vaughn, in "Lectures
on Philippians."
    4. "In the typical service; only those who had come be-
fore God with confession and repentance, and whose sins,
through- the blood of the sin offering, were transferred to the
sanctuary, had a part in the service of the day of,atonement.
So in the great day of final atonement and investigative
judgment, the only cases considered are those of the pro-
fessed people of God. The judgment of the wicked is a dis-
tinct and separate work, and takes place at a later period.
`Judgment must begin at the house of God; and if it first
begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the
gospel?' "-"Great Controversy," p. 480.

       Verse 6.

                              Notes
     1. A Partaker of the Glory That Shall Be Revealed.—
God's glory is in His character. (See Ex. 33: 18, 19; 34: 5-
7.) That character, that glory, will be seen in all its tran-
scendent loveliness when the King appears in His beauty (Isa.
33: 17) ; but men may know Him here (John 17: 3), by faith
they may now appropriate His righteousness (Rom. 3: 21, 22) ,
and have the beauty of the Lord upon them (Ps. 90: 17).
And so Peter in this life partook of the glory which shall
be revealed, not only in Christ but in us (Rom. 8 : 18).
    2. Neither as Being Lords over God's Heritage.— There
is a strange and striking contrast between that church which
claims to find her primal head in Peter, and in which is the
highest development of the mystery of iniquity, and the in-
struction given by the Lord through Peter to the true church
of Christ. In the apostate church, we have lords many, who do
little else but lord it over the souls of God's heritage; and
when they held the power, they lorded it over their bodies, and
all of the persecutions of the Dark Ages have come because
men professing to be ministers of Christ have lorded it over
God's heritage in their lust of power and filthy lucre. The
apostle presents the duty of the true elder; let him heed the
instructions, and not content himself with being better than
others. Feed the flock of God with the Word (1 Peter 2: 2),
which is able to build them up (Acts 20: 32) ; doing willingly
even as the Master, having compassion (Mark 6: 34), not for
gain of lucre, but gain of souls, ensamples to the flock in all
soberness, humility, and faithfulness. (See 1 Tim. 3: 1-7;
Titus 1: 5-9.)
     3. "AU who regard as an unwelcome task the care and
burdens that fall to the lot of the faithful shepherd, are re-
proved by the apostle: 'Not by constraint, but willingly; not
for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind.' All such unfaithful
servants the Chief Shepherd would willingly release. The
 church of Christ has been purchased with His blood, and
every shepherd should realize that the sheep under his care
 cost an infinite sacrifice. He should regard them each as of
 priceless worth, and should be unwearied in his efforts to keep
 them in a healthy, flourishing condition. The shepherd who is
 imbued with the spirit of Christ will imitate His self-denying
30          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

example, constantly laboring for the welfare of his charge;
and the flock will prosper under his care."—"Patriarchs and
Prophets," p. 192.
    4. Submit — Be Subject.— Of course under God. God is
first. His requirements are paramount. But the faithful
man of God upon whom, in the providence of God, is placed
burdens in the church, God Will sustain, and through him will
give instruction to the flock, which may not be disregarded
or despised except at peril to the soul. As the elder must
watch for souls as they that must give account (Heb.
13: 17), so it is a corresponding duty of the church to heed
the faithful admonitions, warnings, and instruction which
God gives through the elders. See Heb. 13: 7, 17; 1 Thess.
5: 12, 13. The dignity and position of the elder is to be
respected for Christ's sake (1 Tim. 5: 1), and no accusation
is to be received against him except at the mouth of two or
three witnesses (verse 19).
    5. Subject One to Another.— See Phil. 2: 3; Rom. 12: 10;
Eph. 5: 21.
    6. Humility.— A most precious grace, because teachable.
See Matt. 5: 3; Isa. 57: 15; 62: 2; James 4: 10.
    7. "God would have His people disciplined and brought
into harmony of action, that they may see eye to eye, and be
of the same mind and of the same judgment. . . . It will
be necessary to reprove and exhort, and some will need to be
rebuked sharply, as the case demands. We hear the plea, 'Oh,
I am so sensitive, I cannot bear the least reflection!' If these
persons would state the case correctly, they would say, 'I ,
am so self-willed, so self-sufficient, so proud-spirited, that I
will not be dictated to; I will not be reproved. I claim the.
right of individual judgment; I have a right to believe and
talk as I please.' The Lord would not have us yield up our
individuality. But what man is a proper judge of how far
this matter of individual independence should be carried?
Peter exhorts his brethren: 'Likewise, ye younger, submit
yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to
another, and be clothed with humility; for God resisteth the
proud, and giveth grace to the humble.' "—"Testimonies,"
vol. 3, p. 360.

   1. "Jesus is our friend; all heaven is interested in our
welfare; and our anxiety and fear grieve the Holy Spirit
of God. We should not indulge in a solicitude that only frets
and wears us, but does not help us to bear. trials. No place
should be given to that distrust of God which leads us to make

a preparation against future want the chief pursuit of life, as
though our happiness consisted in these earthly things. It is
not the will of God that His people should be weighed down
with care."—"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 294.
    2. "The inspired warning is sounding down the centuries
to our time: 'Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary
the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he
may devour.'         on the hole armor of God, that ye may be
able to stand against the wiles of the devil.' From the days
of Adam to our own time, our great enemy has been exer-
cising his power to oppress and destroy. He is now prepar-
ing for his last campaign against the church. All who seek
to follow Jesus will be brought into conflict with this relent-
less foe. The more nearly the Christian imitates the divine
Pattern, the more surely will he make himself a mark for the
attacks of Satan."—"Great Controversy," p. 510.
    3. Whom Resist.— The only way to resist the enemy is
by faith in Christ. If our eyes are fixed upon the enemy, we
fall before him. When Peter looked down upon the raging
waves, he sank; when his eyes were on Christ, he safely
walked the boiling billows. "Looking unto Jesus" is our only
safety (Heb. 12: 2, 3) ; for faith puts Him before us so that
we do not have to meet the enemy; Christ meets him.
    4. Called.— Let the heart rest on the great fact that God
has called us, not to wrath (1 Thess. 5: 9), but to eternal
glory (1 Peter 5: 10) ; Christ died that all might have it
 (John 3: 16; 20: 31) •' He accepted us according to the good
pleasure of His will (Eph. 1: 5, 6) ; He has wrought us for
immortality (2 Cor. 5: 4, 5) ; and He who has begun the good
work is able to finish it till the day of Jesus Christ (Phil.
1: 6). Why should we doubt God? God Himself has under-
taken the work which it is His will, His good pleasure, to
finish. Shall we not make His will ours? The sufferings and
trials we meet will not hinder Him. Satan will say that we
are killed all day long like sheep for the slaughter; but faith
says, because Christ says, that in all these things, we are
more than conquerors through Him that loved us. Rom.
8: 36-39.
    5. "Thus Peter wrote to the believers at a time of peculiar
trial.to the church. Many had already become partakers of
Christ's sufferings, and soon the church was to undergo a
period of terrible persecution. Within a few brief years many
of those who had stood as teachers and leaders in the church
were to lay down their lives for the -gospel. Soon grievous
wolves were to enter in, not sparing the flock. But none of
these things were to bring discouragement to those whose
hopes were centered in Christ."—"Acts of the Apostles,"
p. 528.
