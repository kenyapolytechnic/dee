                              Notes
    1. The American Revised Version reads, "For the perfect-
ing of the saints, unto the work of ministering, unto the
building up of the body of Christ." The whole idea is the
fitting of the church for united service. The "perfecting" is
not of individual characters; that is implied in the term
"saints." Rather it is the blending of all these individual
units into one working body for Christ; Spirit-filled, Spirit-
endowed, Spirit-guided, for the service or ministry of Christ
in soul-saving, and so building up the body, or church, of
Christ. The Greek word has the thought of fitting up as a
ship is fitted. Peter's wife's mother "ministered" to Jesus,
gave loving heart and hand service. Matt. 8: 15. Ministering
is the rendering of any service, from preaching to the smallest
act, sometimes only a helpful smile. The acceptance of the
gifts of God's Spirit may demolish worldly plans and policies,
but results in building up the church of God. "Knowledge
puffeth up, but love buildeth up." 1 Cor. 8: 1, R. V., margin.
     2. "Every one," "each one." Both expressions are used.
There is not one soldier in Christ's army, not one child in
 His family, not one member in His body, who is to be an
idler. Each and every one has a work to do for the Master
which will use every power of his being. He needs that work
for the formation of character; he owes that work to Him
who released him from the bondage of sin; he must share in
 it as a privilege if he is to be a partaker in the eternal jay.
 The great need of the world now demands our consecration '
 to God's service.
     3. "A gift," according to the Revised Version. Every
 soul has received at least a gift, one gift; and as he has so
 received, let him use it in blessing others.
     4. It is through the Holy Spirit, which is freely given to
 those who believe, that these spiritual gifts are bestowed upon
 the followers of Christ. These gifts are given, not as the
 believer may choose, but as the Spirit wills. They can not
 be acquired by education, or obtained by exercise, and no
 school can bestow them.
     There are many different and distinct gifts of the Holy
 Spirit, such as "gifts of healing, helps, governments," etc.
  Many make a mistake in emphasizing one gift of the Spirit to
 the exclusion of other important and helpful gifts which have
 been placed in the church for the edification of the body.
  While one gift may be more important and helpful than the
 others, all are necessary.
     5. There is no difference in the origin of these gifts, for
 all of them come from a perfect God. The office they fill in
  the church is measured by the extent of the service they are
  designed to render.

15. What will follow the confirmation of the testimony of
      Jesus in us? Verses 6, 7. Note 5.
16. What will this confirmation do for us? Verse 8.
17. How then will the church stand? Eph. 5: 26, 27.
                            Notes
     1. Jesus personally called the first twelve apostles. (Luke
6: 13.) The names of these apostles will be inscribed on the
twelve- foundations of the wall of the New Jerusalem. But
there were other apostles chosen, in addition to the first
twelve. Note the following: Matthias, to take the place of
Judas Iscariot (Acts 1: 26) ; Paul and Barnabas (Acts 13: 2,
3; 14: 14) ; James, the Lord's brother (Gal. 1: 19).
     2. Disciples — followers, learners — come first. We must
first be taught of the Great Teacher before we can be sent
with a message. Jesus chose apostles from among those
whom He had instructed. ,Mark 3: 14.
     3. "Jesus had called His disciples that He might send
them forth as His witnesses, to declare to the world what they
had seen and heard of Him. Their office was the most im-
portant to which human beings had ever been called, and
was second only to that of Christ Himself. They were to be
workers together with God for the saving of the world. As
in the Old Testament the twelve patriarchs stand as repre-
sentatives of Israel, so the twelve apostles were to stand as
representatives of the gospel church."—"Desire of Ages,"
p. 291.
     4. "Prophesy" does not primarily mean to foretell, but to
speak forth, to announce, to declare. • The prophet spoke for
God as Aaron spoke for Moses. Ex. 7: 1, 2. He was God's
messenger to speak God's message. He reproved, rebuked,
warned of present and coming danger, instructed in righteous-
ness and present duty. Foretelling was only a small part of
his work, which frequently was only practical instruction in
righteousness.
     5. We are not to understand that the church, even when
blind to God's law, has not had teachers and evangelists and
 pastors and other persons called of God; for the history of
the past down to the present shows that she has had, but he
 who receives God's law in truth will accept of all the gifts of
 God. 1 Cor. 1: 6, 7 shows that these gifts will come to the
 church when the testimony of Christ is confirmed in the
 church. There is a difference between "confirmed in you"
 and having God's message merely "confirmed unto us." Com-
 pare 1 Cor. 1: '7 and Heb. 2: 3. A thing that is confirmed in
 us becomes a part of us. A thing may be confirmed to us and
 still be rejected.

            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                     7

                               Notes
      1. It will be noted that Paul does not follow the same
 order each time in naming the gifts to the church; and in one
' record, he names more than in the other. Compare 1 Cor.
12: 28-30 with Eph. 4: 11. That some of these gifts are more
  prominent than others, there can be no question (1 Cor. 12:
  31) ; but this prominence does not necessarily depend upon the
  order in which they are named.
      2. An evangelist is one who heralds or preaches the
  evangel, the gospel. Eusebius, writing in the third century
  concerning evangelists, says, "Men do the work of evangelists,
  leaving their homes to preach Christ, and deliver the written
  Gospels to those who were ignorant of the faith."
      The work of the itinerant evangelist prepared the way for
  the permanent pastor. Philip was at first set apart as one of
  seven deacons (Acts 6: 1-7) ; but when persecution arose, and
  they were scattered abroad, they took up the work of evan-
  gelists. Compare Acts 8: 4-6 with 21: 8. The evangelist
  was not necessarily an apostle, bishop, elder, or deacon, al-
  though he might be any of these.
      3. The words "pastor" and "shepherd" are generally
  translations of the same word. The intimate relation of the
  Eastern shepherd to his flock, and its entire dependence upon
  him, are often used to illustrate God's relation to His people.
   Ps. 23; 74: 1; 79: 13; Eze. 34: 8; John 10: 11-18. In the
  church of God, the pastor's work is essentially the same as
  that of the elders. See 1 Peter 5: 1-4.
       4. A glimpse of the life of the Eastern shepherd will
   help us to understand better the figure as applied to the
   Christian pastor. (1) He is exposed to the extremes of heat
   and cold. Gen. 31: 40. (2) His food is frequently simple and
   sometimes insufficient. Amos 7: 14, margin. (3) He is often
   attacked by wild beasts. 1 Sam. 17: 34-36; Isa. 31: 4; Amos
   3: 12. (4) Sometimes he is attacked by robbers. Gen. 31: 39.
   (5) His equipment is very simple, consisting of a sheepskin
   mantle with the fleece on, a wallet containing a small amount
   of food, a sling (1 Sam. 17: 40), and a staff (Ps. 23: 4). (6)
   When at a distance from home, he is supplied with a light tent
    (Song of Solomon 1: 8), which can easily be moved (Isa. 38:
   12). (7) Some of the shepherd's duties are to lead forth his
   flock in the morning (John 10: 4), to find the lost and straying
   ones (Eze. 34: 12; Luke 15: 4) , to supply the sheep with
   pasturage and water (Gen. 29: 7; Ps. 23: 2), to count them as
   they enter the fold at night (Luke 15: 4). The shepherd's
   office requires great watchfulness by night (Luke 2: 8; com-
   pare with Nahum 3: 18) , tenderness toward the young and
   the feeble (Isa. 40: 11), particularly in driving them (Gen.
   33: 13).

17. What is said of those who do and teach the command-
      ments of God? Matt. 5: 19.
18. To what are those teachers compared who turn many to
      righteousness? Dan. 12: 3, margin.
                            Notes
    1. "Went about . . . teaching." It was customary in
Eastern countries for teachers to travel about in their work
of teaching, in company with their disciples, or students.
Christ followed this custom largely in His work of teaching.
    2. "Rabbi" was a term of respect for teachers. Jesus
was called "teacher" oftener, perhaps, than by any other title.
The word translated "master" in the Bible means teacher, and
is generally so rendered in the Revised Version. The office
of teacher was an honorable one in Christ's day, and had been
for centuries before. Many of the most illustrious leaders
in Israel were teachers. The prophetic office was essentially
a teaching office, and Solomon was as much teacher and
preacher as king. So Christ came into an atmosphere of in-
herited respect for the calling of teacher, and He gladly
availed Himself of it.
    "In the Teacher sent from God, heaven gave to men its
best and greatest. He who had stood in the councils of the
Most High, who had dwelt in the innermost sanctuary of the
Eternal, was the One chosen to reveal in person to humanity
the knowledge of God."—"Education," p. 73.
    3. "Whit He taught, He lived. 'I have given you an ex-
ample,' He said to His disciples; 'that ye should do as I have
done.' I have kept My Father's commandments.' Thus in
His life, Christ's words had perfect illustration and support.
And more than this; what He taught, He was. His words
were the expression, not only of His own life-experience; but
of His own character. Not only did He teach the truth, but
He was the truth. It was this that gave His teaching power."
— Id., pp. 78, 79.

   "Those who will put on the whole armor of God, and devote
some time every day to meditation and prayer, and to the
study of the Scriptures, will be connected with Heaven, and
will have a saving, transforming influence upon those around
them."—"Testimonies," vol. 5, p. 112.

                             Notes
    1. "'God is love.' His nature, His law, is love. It ever
has been; it ever will be. 'The high and lofty One that in-
habiteth eternity,' whose ways are everlasting,' changeth not.
With Him 'is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.'
    "Every manifestation of creative power is an expression
of infinite love. The sovereignty of God involves fullness of
blessing to, all created beings. . . .
    "The history of the great conflict between good and evil,
from the time it first began in heaven to the final overthrow
of rebellion and the total eradication of sin, is also a dem-
onstration of God's unchanging love."—"Patriarchs and
Prophets," p. 33.
    2. "All the paternal love which has come down from gen-
eration to generation through the channel of human hearts,
all the springs of tenderness which have opened in the souls
of men, are but as a tiny rill to the boundless ocean, when
compared with the infinite, exhaustless love of God. Tongue
can not utter it; pen can not portray it. You may meditate
upon it every day of your life; you may search the Scriptures
diligently in order to understand it; you may summon every
power and capability that God has given you, in the endeavor
to comprehend the love and compassion of the heavenly
Father; and yet there is an infinity beyond.. You may study
that love for ages; yet you can never fully comprehend the
length and the breadth, the depth and the height, of the love
of God in giving His Son to die for the world., Eternity itself
can never fully reveal it. Yet as we study the Bible, and
meditate upon the•life of Christ and the plan of redemption,
these great themes will open to our understanding more and
more. And it will be ours to realize the blessing which Paul
 desired for the Ephesian church, when he prayed 'that the
 God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may
 give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the
 knowledge of Him; the eyes of your understanding being en-
 lightened, that ye may know what is the hope of His calling,
 and what the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the
 saints, and what is the exceeding greatness of His power to
 us-ward who believe.' "—"Testimonies," vol. 5, p. 70.
     3. "Who can comprehend the love here displayed! The
 angelic host beheld with wonder and with grief Him who had
 been the Majesty of Heaven, and who had worn the crown of
 glory, now wearing the crown of thorns, a bleeding victim to
12            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

the rage of an infuriated mob, fired to insane madness by the
wrath of Satan. Behold the patient sufferer! Upon His head
is the thorny crown. His lifeblood flows from every lacerated
vein. All this in consequence of sin! Nothing could have
induced Christ to leave His honor and majesty in heaven,
and come to a sinful world, to be neglected, despised, and re-
jected, by those He came to save, and finally to suffer upon
the cross, but eternal, redeeming love, which will ever remain
a mystery."Z— /d., vol. 2, p. 207.
    "In the gracious blessings which our heavenly Father
has bestowed upon us, we may discern innumerable evidences
of a love that is infinite, and a tender pity surpassing a
mother's yearning sympathy for her wayward child. When
we study the divine character in the light of the cross, we see
mercy, tenderness, and forgiveness blended with equity and
justice."— Id., vol. 4, p. 461.
    4. "Talk, Pharisaism, and self-praise are abundant; but
these will never win souls to Christ. Pure, sanctified love,
such love as was expressed in Christ's life-work, is as a sacred
perfume. . . . Eloquence, knowledge of truth, rare talents,
mingled with love, are all precious endowments. But ability
alone, the choicest talents alone, can not take the place of love.
    "This love must be manifested by God's workers. Love
for God and for those for whom Christ has died, will do a
work that we can scarcely comprehend. Those who do not
cherish and cultivate this love can not be successful mis-
sionaries."-- Id., vol. 6, p. 84.

                                   Notes
   1. "Those truly love their neighbor as themselves who
realize their responsibilities and the claims that suffering
humanity has upon them, and carry out the principles of God's
law in their daily lives."-"Testimonies," vol. 4, p. 57.
   "The fact that we are under so great obligation to Christ,
places us under the most sacred obligation to those whom He
died to redeein. We are to manifest toward them th'e same
sympathy, the same tender compassion and unselfish love,
which Christ has manifested toward us. Selfish ambition,
desire for supremacy, will die when Christ takes possession
of the affections."- Id., vol. 5, p. 170.
    2. "In order for the church to prosper, there must be a
studious effort on the part of its members to cherish the
precious plant of love. Let it have every advantage that it
14          SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

may flourish in the heart. Every true Christian will develop
in his life the characteristics of this divine love, he will re-
veal a spirit of forbearance, of beneficence, and a freedom
from envy and jealousy. This character developed in word,
and act will not repulse, and will not be unapproachable, cold,
and indifferent to the interests of others. The person who cul-
tivates the precious plant of love will be self-denying in spirit,
and will not yield self-control even under provocation. He
will not impute wrong motives and evil intentions to others,
but will feel deeply over sin when discovered in any of the
disciples of Christ."— Id., p. 123.
    3. "God's love for us is proved daily; yet we are thought-
less of His favors and indifferent to His entreaties. He seeks
to impress us with His spirit of tenderness, His love and for-
bearance; but we scarcely recognize the marks of His kind-
ness, and have little sense of the lesson of love He desires us
to learn. Some, like Haman, forget all God's favors, because
Mordecai is before them and is not disgraced; because their
hearts are filled with enmity and hatred, rather than love,
the spirit of our dear Redeemer, who gave His precious life
for His enemies. We profess to have the same Father, to be
bound to the same immortal home, to enjoy the same solemn
faith, and to believe the same testing message; and yet many
are at strife with one another like quarrelsome children. Some
who are engaged in the same branch of the work are at vari-
ance with one another, and therefore at variance with the
spirit of Christ"— Id., vol. .4, pp. 222, 223.
    4. "There are many in our world who are starving for
the love and sympathy which should be given them. Many
men love their wives, but are too selfish to manifest it. They
have a false dignity and pride, and will not show their love
by words and deeds. There are many men who never know
how starved is the heart of the wife for words of tender ap-
preciation and affection. They bury their loved ones from their
sight, and murmur at the providence of God that has deprived
them of their companions, when, could they look into the
inner life of those companions, they would see that their own
course was the cause of their premature death. The reli-
gion of Christ will lead us to be kind and courteous, and not
so tenacious of our opinions. We should die to self, and
esteem others better than ourselves."— Id., vol. 3; pp. 527, 528.
    5. "We must let Christ into our hearts and homes if we
would walk in the light. Home should be made all that the
word implies. It should be a little heaven upon earth, a place
where the affections are cultivated instead of being studiously
repressed. Our happiness depends upon this cultivation of
love, sympathy, and true courtesy to one another."— Id.,
p. 539.
             SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                            15
    "Hearts that are filled with the love of Christ can never
get very far apart. Religion is love; and a Christian home
is one where love reigns, and finds expression in words and
acts of thoughtful kindness and gentle courtesy."- Id., vol.
5, p. 335.
    "Home is the holy of holies of a man's life. There he
withdraws from all the world, and, shutting his door, is alone
with those who are his own. It is the reservoir of hrs strength,
the restorer of his energies, the resting place from his toil,
the brooding place for his spirit, the inspiration for all his
activities and battles.
    "Home is where love lives. Not where it boards, nor pays
occasional visits, even long visits, nor even where it may be
a sort of permanent guest, with familiar access to certain
rooms and cozy corners. But where it owns the front-door
key, sits by the glow of a hearth-fire of its own kindling, and
pervades the whole house with its presence. It may be a
king's spacious, luxurious palace. It may be the poor man's
narrow-walled cottage, or anywhere in between these two ex-
tremes."-"Quiet Talks on Home Ideals," Gordon, p. 81.

                             Notes
    1. "When the straying sheep is at last brought home, the
shepherd's gratitude finds expression in melodious songs of
rejoicing. He calls upon his friends and neighbors, saying
unto them, 'Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which
was lost.' So when a wanderer is found by the great Shep-
herd of the sheep, heaven and earth unite in thanksgiving and
rejoicing."-"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 189.
    "The rabbis had a saying that there is rejoicing in heaven
when one who has sinned against God is destroyed; but Jesus
taught that to God the work of destruction is a strange work.
That in which all heaven delights is the restoration of God's
own image in the souls whom He has made."- Id., p. 190.
    2. "Ever before Him He [Jesus] saw the result of His mis-
sion. His earthly life, so full of toil and self-sacrifice, was
cheered by the prospect that He would not have all this travail
for naught. By giving His life for the life of men, He would
win back the world to its loyalty to God. Although the bap-
tism of blood must first be received; although the sins of
the world were to weigh upon His innocent soul; although the
shadow of an unspeakable woe was upon Him ; yet for the
joy that was set before Him, He chose to endure the cross,
and despised the shame."-"Desire of Ages," p. 410.
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                    17

     3. "All who have borne with Jesus the cross of sacrifice,
will be sharers with Him of His glory. It was the joy of
Christ in His humiliation and pain, that His disciples should be
glorified with Him. They are the fruit of His self-sacrifice. The
outworking in them of His own character and spirit, is His
reward, and will be His joy throughout eternity."— Id., p. 624.
     4. "The life in which the fear of the Lord is cherished
will not be a life of sadness and gloom. It is the absence of
Christ that makes the countenance sad, and the life a pil-
grimage of sighs. Those who are filled with self-esteem and
self-love do not feel the need of a living, personal union with
Christ. The heart that has not fallen on the Rock is proud of its
wholeness. Men want a dignified religion. They desire to
walk in a path wide enough to take in their own attributes.
Their self-love, their love of popularity and love of praise, ex-
clude the Saviour from their hearts, and without Him there
is gloom and sadness. But Christ dwelling in the soul is a
wellspring of joy."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 162.
     5. "They will enter into the joy of the Lord as they see in
 His kingdom those who have been redeemed through their
instrumentality. And they are privileged to participate in
 His work there, because they have gained a fitness for it by
participation in His work here. What we shall be in heaven
 is the reflection of what we are now in character and holy
service. Christ said of Himself, 'The Son of man came not to be
ministered unto, but to minister.' This, His work on earth,
is His work in heaven. And our reward for working with
Christ in this world is the greater power and wider privilege
of working with Him in the world to come."— Id., p. 361.
     "However trying their labor, the true workers do not re-
 gard it as drudgery. They are ready to spend and to be
 spent; but it is a cheerful work, done with a glad heart.
 Joy in God is expressed through Jesus Christ. Their joy is
 the joy set before Christ,—`to do the will of Him that sent
 Me, and to finish His work.' They are in cooperation with the
 Lord of glory. This thought sweetens all toil, it braces the will,
 it nerves the spirit for whatever may befall. Working with
 unselfish heart, ennobled by being partakers of Christ's suf-
 ferings, sharing His sympathies, and cooperating with Him
 in His labor, they help to swell the tide of His joy, and bring
 honor and praise to His exalted name."— Id., pp. 402, 403.
     "All who commune with God will find abundance of work
 to do for Him. Those who go forth in the spirit of the Mas-
 ter, seeking to reach souls with the truth, will not find the
 work of drawing souls to Christ a dull, uninteresting
 drudgery. They are charged with a work as God's husband-
 men, and they will become more and more vitalized as they
give themselves to the service of God. It is a joyous work to
 open the Scriptures to others."—"Testimonies," vol. 9, p. 118.

                              Notes
    1. " 'Peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ' is
the state and the experience of those who have been 'recon-
ciled' to the Father through the sacrifice offered by the Son
of His love, whose 'trespasses' are 'forgiven' and in whose
heart 'the spirit of adoption' dwells. Reconciled to God, men
are reconciled to life and the world; by His cross Christ 'has
slain' at a blow 'the enmity' between God and man and be-
tween race and race. 'Peace on earth' is to flow from 'the
peace of Christ.' "— G. G. Findlay, in "Hastings' Bible Dic-
tionary," art. "Peace."
    "The only power that can create or perpetuate true
peace is the grace of Christ. When this is implanted in the
heart, it will cast out the evil passions that cause strife and
dissension."—"Desire of Ages," p. 305.
    2. "In His discourse to the disciples, Jesus made no mourn-
ful allusion to His own sufferings and death. His last
legacy to them was a legacy of peace. He said, 'Peace I
leave with you, My peace I give unto you; not as the world
giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled,
neither let it be afraid.' "— Id., p. 672.
    "Shortly before His crucifixion, Christ had bequeathed to
His disciples a legacy of peace. . . . This peace is not the
peace that comes through conformity to the world. Christ
never purchased peace by compromise with evil. The peace that
Christ left His disciples is internal rather than external, and
was ever to remain with His witnesses through strife and
contention."—"Acts of the Apostles," p. 84.
    3. It is only the peace we make on earth that we can con-
fidently look forward to in heaven. If we lose it here, we shall
not overtake it there. And this peace is to be found in Christ,
of whom it is said: "In the heart of Christ, where reigned
perfect harmony with God, there was perfect peace. He was
never elated by applause, nor dejected by censure or disap-
pointment. Amid the greatest opposition and the most cruel
treatment, He was still of good courage. But many who pro-
fess to be His followers have an anxious, troubled heart, be-
cause they are afraid to trust themselves with God. They
do not make a complete surrender to Him; for they shrink
from the consequences that such a surrender may involve.
Unless they do make this surrender, they can not find peace."
—"Desire of Ages," p. 330.

                             Notes
   1. The Greek word means more than patience, means
more than an equable demeanor and sweetness under provo-
cation. It means endurance. Some versions render it "en-
durance," some "patient endurance." Our moods, our feel-
ings, are not always the same,. but endurance presses on to
the end. The great thought is illuminated in the Revised
Version of James 5: 11, 12, "Behold, we call them blessed that
endured: ye have heard of the patience [endurance] of Job."
Job was often what we call impatient, in its little meaning,
toward his friends and toward God, but he endured. God
wants those who are sweet and pleasant always, of course;
but above all things else, He wants those who endure.
    "In patient forbearance we shall conquer. It is patience
in service that brings rest to the soul. It is through humble,
diligent, faithful toilers that the welfare of Israel is pro-
moted. A word of love and encouragement will do more to
subdue the hasty temper and willful disposition than all the
faultfinding and censure that you can heap upon the erring
one."—"Gospel Workers," p. 497.
    " 'The husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the
earth, and hath long patience for it, until' he receive the early
and latter rain.' So the Christian is to wait with patience
for the fruition, in his life, of the word of God. Often when
we pray for the graces of the Spirit, God works to answer
our prayers by placing us in circumstances to develop these
fruits; but we do not understand His purpose, and wonder,
and are dismayed. Yet none can develop these graces ex-
cept through the process of growth and fruit-bearing. Our
part is to receive God's word and to hold it fast, yielding our-
selves fully to its control, and its purpose in •us will be ac-
complished."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 61.
    "There is a high standard to which we are to attain if we
would be children of God, noble, pure, holy, and undefiled;
and a pruning process is necessary if we would reach this
standard. How would this pruning be accomplished if there
were no difficulties to meet, no obstacles to surmount, noth-
ing to call out patience and endurance? These trials are not
the smallest blessings in our experience. They are designed
to nerve us to determination to succeed. We are to use them
as God's means to gain decided victories over self, instead of
allowing them to hinder, oppress, and destroy us.
22.        SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY
    "Character will be tested. Christ will be revealed in us
if we are indeed branches of the Living Vine. We shall be
patient, kind, and forbearing, cheerful amid frets and irri-
tations. Day by day and year by year we shall conquer self
and grow into a noble heroism. This is our allotted task; but
it can not be accomplished without continual help from Jesus,
resolute decision, unwavering purpose, continual watchful-
ness, and unceasing prayer. Each one has a personal battle
to fight. Each must win his own way through struggles and
discouragements. Those who decline the struggle lose the
strength and joy of victory. No one, not even God, can carry
us to heaven unless we make the necessary effort on our part.
We must put features of beauty into our lives. We must
expel the unlovely natural traits that make us unlike Jesus.
 While God works in us to will and to do of His own good
pleasure, we must work in harmony with Him. The religion
of Christ transforms the heart. It makes the worldly-
minded man heavenly-minded. Under its influence the self-
ish man becomes unselfish, because this is the character of
Christ. The dishonest, scheming man becomes upright, so
that it is second nature to him to do unto others as he would
have others do unto him. The profligate is changed from im-
purity to purity. He forms correct habits; for the gospel of
Christ has become to him a savor of life unto life."—"Testi-
monies," vol. 5, pp. 344, 345.
    2. "The first great business of your life is to be a mis-
sionary at home. Clothe yourself with humility and patience,
forbearance and love, and go about the work that God has
ordained you should do, which no other one can do for you.
It is a work for which you will be held responsible in the
day of retribution. God's blessing can not rest upon an ill-
disciplined household. Kindness and patience must rule in
the home to make it happy."— Id., vol. 4, p. 138.
    3. "Cultivate a disposition to esteem others better than
yourself. Be less self-sufficient, less confident; cherish pa-
tience, forbearance, and brotherly love. Be ready to help the
erring, and have pity and tender sympathy toward those who
are weak. You need not leave your business in order to
glorify the Lord; but you may, from day to day, in every deed
and word, while pursuing your usual avocations, honor Him
whom you serve, thereby influencing for the right those with
whom you are brought in contact."— Id., p. 133. It is this
admonition, adhered to, that will make the remnant church
one of which it can be said, "Here is the patience of the
saints."

tiGn to the appropriation voted to that field. Shall we not

                            Notes
    1. Most versions render "kindness" in Gal. 5: 22 instead
of "gentleness," and that seems to be the sense. "Mercy" in
Ex. 34: 7 means loving-kindness, and is so rendered in Ps.
103: 4 and elsewhere.
    "The pattern of all kindness is set before us in the Bible
in the behavior of God to our race. He gives the sunshine
and the rain, and fruitful seasons and glad hearts, food and
all the good we have, to the just and the unjust alike. But
the exceeding wealth of His grace is shown unto us in kind-
ness toward us in Christ Jesus. God's glory no man can look
upon and live. It is a light that no man can approach un10.
It is inconceivably great, incomprehensibly grand, unimagin-
ably exalted above the grasp of man's mind. But the kind-
ness of God is God's glory stooping to man's need. It is God's
power brought within man's reach. It is God's mercy and
God's love and God's grace flowing through time and through
eternity, as broad as the race, as deep as man's need. . . .
The Bible reveals it. Jesus incarnated it"— Hayes, in "Hast-
ings' Bible Dictionary," p. 515, art. "Kindness."
    2. "We ourselves owe everything to God's free grace.
Grace in the covenant ordained our adoption. Grace in the
Saviour effected our redemption, our regeneration, and our
exaltation to heirship with Christ. Let this grace be revealed
to others."—"Christ's Object Lessons," p. 250.
    "Man can not transform himself by the exercise of his
will. He possesses no power by which this change can be
effected. The leaven — something wholly from without —
must be put into the meal before the desired change can be
wrought in it. So the grace of God must be received by
the sinner before he can be fitted for the kingdom of glory.
All the culture and education which the world can give, will
fail of making a degraded child of sin a child of heaven. The
renewing energy must come from God. The change can be
made only by the Holy Spirit. All who would be saved, high
or low, rich or poor, must submit to the working of this
power."— Id., pp. 96, 97.
    "The power and tenderness, the majesty and meekness,
the strength and patience, that he [John I saw in the daily life
of the Son of God, filled his soul with admiration. He yielded
his resentful, ambitious temper to the molding power of
             SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                            25

Christ, and, divine love wrought in him a transformation of
character."-"Acts of the Apostles," p. 557.
    3. "Those who are fighting the battle of life at great odds
may be refreshed and strengthened by little attentions which
cost nothing. Kindly words simply spoken, little attentions
simply bestowed, will sweep away the clouds of temptation
and doubt that gather over the soul. The true heart-expres-
sion of Christlike sympathy, given in simplicity, has power
to open the door of hearts that need the simple, delicate touch
of the spirit of Christ."-"Testimonies," vol. 9, p. 30.
    "My brethren and sisters, visit those who live near you,
and by sympathy and kindness seek to reach their hearts."-
Id., p. 34.

21. What is the end of perfect faith? Verses 8, 9.
                             Notes
    1. Goodness is represented in the Bible as a particular at-
tribute of God, the Father. Thus when one came to Jesus
calling Him good, He declared that God alone is good. And
in the texts referred to in Questions 1 and 2 of this lesson,
"goodness" is used as a general term covering the other
phases of God's character as revealed to Moses. Neverthe-
less, in the record of Jesus, it is stated that He went about
doing good; thus, even as with God, the appellation must
be fitting when applied to Him. Not only so, but as sons
of God and followers of Christ, we, in our sphere, are cer-
tainly to have our characters illuminated with this godly
attribute.
    2. "It is not enough to believe about Christ; we must
believe in Him. The only faith that will benefit us is that
which embraces Him as a personal Saviour; which appro-
priates His merits to ourselves. Many hold faith as an
opinion. But saving faith is a transaction, by which those
who receive Christ join themselves in covenant relation with
God. Genuine faith is life. A living faith means an in-
crease of vigor, a confiding trust, by which the soul becomes
a conquering power."-"Gospel Workers," p. 261.
    3. One can hardly read the words, "The just shall live by
faith," without thinking of the experience of Martin Luther,
a brief sketch of which is given in "Great Controversy," page
125: "An indulgence had been promised by the pope to all
who should ascend upon their knees 'Pilate's staircase,' said
to have been descended by our Saviour on leaving the Roman
judgment hall, and to have been miraculously conveyed from
            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY                   27

Jerusalem to Rome. Luther was one day devoutly climbing
these steps, when suddenly a voice like thunder seemed to
say to him, 'The just shall live by faith.' He sprung to his
feet, and hastened from the place, in shame and horror.
That text never lost its power upon his soul: From that
time he saw more clearly than ever before the fallacy of trust-
ing to human works for salvation, and the necessity of
constant faith in the merits of Christ. His eyes had been
opened, and were never again to be closed, to the delusions
of the papacy."
    4. " 'What things soever ye desire when ye pray, believe
that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.' Here is faith,
naked faith, to believe that we receive the blessing, even be-
fore we realize it. When the promised blessing is realized
and enjoyed, faith is swallowed up. But many suppose they
have much faith when sharing largely of the Holy Spirit,
and that they can not have faith unless they feel the power
of the Spirit. Such confound faith with the blessing that
comes through faith. The very time to exercise faith is when
we feel destitute of the Spirit. When thick clouds of dark-
ness seem to hover over the mind, then is the time to let living
faith pierce the darkness and scatter the clouds. True faith
rests on the promises contained in the word of God, and those
only who obey that Word can claim its glorious promises.
`If ye abide in Me, and My words abide in you, ye shall ask
what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.' John 15: 7.
`Whatsoever we ask we receive of Him, because we keep His
 commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in His
sight.' 1 John 3: 22."—"Early Writings," pp. 72, 73.
    5. "True faith and true prayer—how strong they are!
 They are as two arms by which the human suppliant lays
hold upon the power of Infinite Love. Faith is trusting in
 God,— believing that He loves us, and knows what is for our
best good. Thus, instead of our own way, it leads us to choose
 His way. In place of our ignorance, it accepts His wisdom ;
 in place of our weakness, His strength; in place of our sin-
 fulness, His righteousness. Our lives, ourselves, are already
 His; faith acknowledges His ownership, and accepts its bless-
 ing. Truth, uprightness, purity, are pointed out as secrets
 of life's success. It is faith that puts us in possession of
 these. Every good impulse or aspiration is the gift of God;
 faith receives from God the life that alone can produce true
 growth and efficiency.                                          •
     " 'This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our
 faith.' "—"Gospel Workers," p. 259.
     "Let a living faith run like threads of gold through the
 performance of even the smallest duties. Then all the daily
 work will promote Christian growth. There will be a continual
 looking unto Jesus. Love for Him will give vital force to
28            SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

everything that is undertaken. Thus through the right use
of our talents, we may link ourselves by a golden chain to the
higher world. This , is true sanctification; for sanctification
consists in the cheerful performance of daily duties in per-
fect obedience to the will of God."-"Christ's Object Lessons,"
p. 360.
   6. "When faith is in strong and blessed exercise, there is
no limit to its possibilities, because it taps the reservoirs of
Omnipotence, and opens- the sluice-gates, so that all God's
power begins to flow into the soul. Our faith is the means
of our receptivity; the straits through which the ocean of
divine fullness pours its tides.
   "But if our faith be meager and struggling, we can
not expect mighty deliverances. Smite but thrice upon the
ground, and Syria will still defy you (2 Kings 13: 19). If
you do not expect that God is able to keep you, do not be
surprised if you are not kept. According to your faith, or
unbelief, so will it be done to you."- F. B. Meyer.

                             Notes
   1. "Christ's enemies had demanded a miracle as evidence
of His divinity. They had evidence far greater than any
they had sought. As their cruelty degraded His torturers
below humanity into the likeness of Satan, so did His meek-
ness and patience exalt Jesus above humanity, and prove His
'dnship to God. His abasement was the pledge of His
exaltation. The blood-drops of agony that from His wounded
temples flowed down His face and beard were the pledge of
His anointing with 'the oil of gladness' as our great high
priest."-"Desire of Ages," p. 734.
   2. "Moses 'was very meek, above all the men which were
upon the face of the earth,' and this is why he was granted
divine wisdom and guidance above all others. Says the Scrip-
ture, 'The meek will He guide in judgment, and the meek
will He teach His way.' The meek are guided by the Lord,
because they are teachable, willing to be instructed."-
"Patriarchs and Prophets," p. 384.
   3. " 'Blessed are the meek.' The difficulties we have to
encounter may be very much lessened by that meekness which
hides itself in Christ. If we possess the humility of our
Master, we shall rise above the slights, the rebuffs, the an-
noyances to which we are daily exposed, and they will cease
to cast a gloom over the spirit. The highest evidence of
nobility in a Christian is self-control. He who under abuse
or cruelty fails to maintain a calm and trustful spirit, robs
 God of His right to reveal in him His own perfection of char-

acter. Lowliness of heart is the strength that gives victory
to the followers of Christ; it is the token of their connection
with the courts above.
    " 'Though the Lord be high, yet hath He respect unto the
lowly.' Those who reveal the meek and lowly spirit of Christ
are tenderly regarded by God. They may be looked upon
with scorn by the world, but they are of great value in His
sight."—"Desire of Ages," p. 301.
    4. "Jesus places meekness among the first qualifications
for His kingdom. In His own life and character the divine
beauty of this precious grace is revealed. . . . Human na-
ture is ever struggling for expression, ready for contest; but
he who learns of Christ is emptied of self, of pride, of love
of supremacy, and there is silence in the soul. Self is yielded
to the disposal of the Holy Spirit. Then we are not anxious
to have the highest place. We have no ambition to crowd
and elbow ourselves into notice; but we feel that our highest
place is at the feet of our Saviour. . . . The meekness of
Christ, manifested in the home, will make the inmates happy;
it provokes no quarrel, gives back no angry answer, but
soothes the irritated temper, and diffuses a gentleness that
is felt by all within its charmed circle. Wherever cherished,
it makes the families of earth a part of the one great family
above."—"Mount of Blessing," pp. 29, 30, 32.
    5. The next few questions introduce the word "humble-
ness," but "humbleness" and "meekness" are often closely
allied in meaning.
    6. "The meekness and lowliness of Christ is the Ghristian's
power. It is indeed more precious than all things which
genius can create, or wealth can buy. Of all things that are
sought, cherished, and cultivated, there is nothing so valuable
in the sight of God as a pure heart, a disposition imbued with
thankfulness and peace."—"Testimonies," vol. 4, p. 559.
    7. "We may be sure of this blessed thought, that they
who meekly live, knowing and mourning their sin, and who
meekly take to their hearts as their only hope the comfort
of Christ's pardon and cleansing, who are meekly recipient,
meekly enduring, meekly obedient, shall have in their hearts,
even here, a quiet fountain of peace which shall make the
wilderness rejoice and blossom as the rose, and hereafter
shall be crowned with the lordship of all. Meekness over-
comes, 'and he that overcometh shall inherit all things.' "—
"Exposition of the Scriptures," vol. 6, pp. 134, 135.

day for the quarter? The Sabbath schools are expected to
raise one half the sixty cents a week. Why not square up?

32         SABBATH SCHOOL LESSON QUARTERLY

                             Notes
    1. For the word "temperance" given in the Authorized
Version, the Revised Versions have "self-control." See such
texts as Gal. 5: 23; Acts 24: 25; 1 Cor. 9: 25; etc. This gives
a clearer idea. True temperance means to exercise self-
control in all things.
    2. "If we can arouse the moral sensibilities of our people
on the subject of temperance, a great victory will be gained.
Temperance in all things of this life is to be taught and
practiced. Temperance in eating, drinking, sleeping, and
dressing is one of the grand principles of the religious life.
Truth brought into the sanctuary of the soul will guide in the
treatment of the body. Nothing that concerns the health of the
human agent is to be regarded with indifference. Our eternal
welfare depends upon the use we make during this life of our
time, strength, and influence."—"Testimonies,' vol. 6, p. 375.
     3. "There are many in the world who indulge pernicious
habits. Appetite is the law that governs them; and because
of their wrong habits, the moral sense is clouded and the
power to discern sacred things is to a great extent destroyed.
But it is necessary for Christians to be strictly temperate.
They should place their standard high. Temperance in eat-
ing, drinking, and dressing is essential. Principle should rule
instead of appetite or fancy. Those who eat too much, or
whose food is of an objectionable quality, are easily led into
dissipation, and into other 'foolish and hurtful lusts, which
drown men in destruction and perdition.' "—Id., p. 374.
     4. "There is real common sense in health reform. People
can not all eat the same things. Some articles of food that
are wholesome and palatable to one person, may be hurtful
to another. Some can not use milk, while others can subsist
upon it. For some, dried beans and peas are wholesome, while
others can not digest them. Some stomachs have become so
sensitive that they can not make use of the coarser kind of
Graham flour. So it is impossible to make an unvarying rule by
which to regulate every one's dietetic habits. Narrow ideas,
an overstraining of small points, have been a great injury
to the cause of hygiene."—"Christian Temperance," p. 57.
     Temperance is a fruit of the Holy Spirit, and in its truest
sense can be acquired only by the operations of the Spirit of
 God on the intemperate passions of the natural heart. It is
a thing of the heart, a fruit of righteousness, a purification
of the soul from unclean passions through faith. Its object
is the attainment of a pure and holy life, which is wrought
only by the operation of the Spirit of God.
     5. The Revised Version of Rom. 12: 1 reads: "I beseech
 you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present
 your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which
 is your spiritual service."
