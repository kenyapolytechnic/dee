                            THE IMPORTANCE
                       OF SABBATH-SCHOOL GIVING


      H      OW fitting it is that the missions feature should be a prominent
              part of every Sabbath-school session, and that each member in
      each division should be encouraged to bring a liberal offering as he
      enters the house of God on Sabbath morning. The Sabbath school
      is the church at study. The subject is the love of God, who made the
      supreme gift of His Son for the salvation of men. This is the one
      grand theme of the Bible. The human agents seeking the lost are
      those men and women who have themselves believed and who long
      to give their all in order to be channels of that divine blessing which
      has brought them eternal life.
          So, regularly every week in the year, and in every division of the
      Sabbath school, the mission appeal is given. The marvelous results of
      our past liberality are revealed in the thrilling reports from the fields
      beyond. We are reminded, too, of the lands of earth where the mes-
      sage of present truth is still unknown. May we continue to give of our
      abundance in these closing days of opportunity.
          The foreign missions program of the church largely depends
      upon the offerings received in the Sabbath school. These gifts have
      been a rich and unfailing source of supply for the world-wide harvest
      field. But the task is not yet done. The calls for more workers and
      more facilities continue to multiply. Some overseas fields have been
      obliged to reduce their staff of laborers for want of sufficient funds to
      meet the rapidly increasing costs that have overtaken them. We must
      by all means see to it that this condition is temporary and soon reme-
      died. Every Sabbath-school member is under the most solemn obliga-
      tion to make sure that he is doing his full part in bringing bountiful
      gifts to the treasury of heaven, and thus having a share in hastening
      the Lord's return.

                        THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
                                     September 24

       This quarter the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering overflow again goes to the Far
 Eastern Division to give help on three specific projects: (I) the Philippine Union
 College, (2) the West New Guinea school, and (3) medical work in Okinawa.
       The buildings of the Philippine Union College, constructed twenty-five years
ago, are the same buildings that are in use today; despite the fact that the enroll-
ment has grown from less than 30o to more than 1,15o students. Among the
many needs of the college, one of the most urgent is for a house of worship. And
it is this need we may help to supply through a portion of the offering overflow.
      The West New Guinea Mission is one of the newest missions in the Far
Eastern Division. The needs in this field are great, and one of the greatest is for
a school where young people can be trained to work for their own people.
      Perhaps the name Okinawa was seldom heard before World War II, but now
it is known by every schoolboy. Our work is making progress on that island, but
there are many needs, the chief of which is for some kind of medical work. And
that is what we are going to help to supply through the Thirteenth Sabbath
Offering overflow.
