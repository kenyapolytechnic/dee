                          THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING

                                      December 24, 1955

   This quarter the overflow of the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering goes to two
interesting fields- that we do not hear as much about as we do of some other
parts of the world. These are two mission fields of the Southern European
Division—the island of Madagascar, and Portuguese East Africa. The Gen-
eral Conference, through the Southern European Division, has bought 2,50o
acres of good land twelve miles from the railroad near Vila Pery in Portu-
guese East Africa in order to establish a new mission station. We have pros-
pects of a good evangelistic work among the natives and also among the
large white population. There are no other missions in the locality. We must
build a school, a church, a dispensary, and houses for missionary families.
Our first secular work will be farming, and for this we need agricultural
implements. It is to help meet these needs that part of the overflow will be
used at the end of the fourth quarter.
    The rest of the overflow will go to Madagascar to help establish a new
mission station at Tamatave. The main thing about this mission station will
be a training school where workers can be trained to work for their own peo-
ple. These far-distant fields are looking to Sabbath-school members around
the world to bring a real Christmas offering on December 24. Let us not dis-
appoint them.
