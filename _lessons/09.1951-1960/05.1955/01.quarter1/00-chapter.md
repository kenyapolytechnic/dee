   Faith must come first. Someone must
believe before the power of Jesus could be

the faith of the disciples. The Pharisees and
the crowd had no faith. Jesus saw the solu-

heart of the boy's father.

                       THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING

                     March 26, 1955—Middle East Division

   This quarter we visit the ancient lands of the Middle East, where go per
cent of the ninety-five million people are Moslems. In considering the many
urgent needs in this division, the division committee chose two projects to
benefit from the overflow of the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering. The first
project is a medical launch to take the message to people living in the thou-
sands of villages along the banks of the Nile River, Egypt. To the hundreds
of thousands of suffering ones living along the entire length of this river,
the doctor and nurses of this medical launch will seem like angels of mercy.
   The second project is an evangelistic center for the city of Beirut, Lebanon.
Beirut is a modern, metropolitan city, and we greatly need a place where
year-round evangelism can be carried on.
