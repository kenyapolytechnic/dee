              Introduction
  Whether it be nations, states, churches,
groups, families, or individuals, the usual
question is, "Who shall be the greatest?"
Jesus wants men to learn that greatness de-
pends upon the willingness to serve.


      Jesus Discusses Greatness

   1. With what discerning question
to His disciples did Jesus open the
subject of greatness prior to the in-
stitution of the Lord's Supper? Mark
9:33, 34.

2:1-4, 16-18.


   NoTE.—As the disciples would take their
eyes off the physical presence of Jesus in
His human flesh (for "the flesh profiteth
little") and would feel their need for His
spiritual presence (2 Cor. 6:16) in their
own flesh, the Spirit would come. Christ
would be closer to them in the Spirit than
ever He had been in the flesh.
   "Henceforth through the Spirit, Christ
was to abide continually in the hearts of His
children. Their union with Him was closer
than when He was personally with them."

Spirit? John 16:7-11. Compare Acts

                                                words are life, and since the bodily flesh
                                                profiteth little, then Christ's words and His

God's image in man, the integration of man
into all the loving purposes of God, is the
real reason for giving to the disciples the         Close of the Upper-Room Service

  NOTE. Smith's Bible Dictionary, under
"Passover," says that, at the time of the
Passover, Jesus and His disciples are sup-
posed to have sung Psalms 115 to 118. Ac-
cording to The Desire of Ages, page 672, Je-
sus and His disciples sang (at least) Psalm
117 after the Last,Supper. It is significant
that Jesus sang this particularly joyful
psalm when He was under such a burden.

     the section of the "Worker" giving the Reading Course assign-

New Guinea—places that made news headlines during World War II—come
alive again as we listen to the mission stories this quarter, for the overflow
from the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering that will be given on December 26
will go to the Australasian Division to help in building the Coral Sea Union
Mission College, where young people from many of these South Sea islands
may be trained to carry the gospel to their own people. Let us rally to the aid
of these young people who showed such a spirit of integrity and Christian
helpfulness during the war when they were cut off from mission help.
