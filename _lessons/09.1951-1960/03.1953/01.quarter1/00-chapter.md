SENIOR DIVISION   FIRST QUARTER 1953
                                    Introduction
          The Christian church is passing through a perilous age. In
       many lands the forces of evil have passed from veiled opposition
       into open persecution. There are Christian martyrs today as
       there were in the distant past. The fiercest testing time in his-
       tory may break upon the church in this hour.
          In such an age as this the church needs the sustaining assur-
       ance of God's presence. From the Sacred Word of God we must
       draw living power by storing its precious promises in our minds
       and by building character on its eternal truths. From the mes-
       sages of the spirit of prophecy we are to find heaven's counsel
       for the church. In the church of Jesus Christ we are to find the
       sweet fellowship of kindred spirits, encouraging, inspiring,
       strengthening us for the last great conflict.
          Such are the themes of this quarter's lessons. Studied daily,
       received into the heart, they cannot fail to bring great blessing
       to the faithful.

               Their Names                           NoTE.—Observe the expressions, "gave,"

Writings? Luke 4:21; Matt. 21:42.


  NOTE.—The expressions Scripture and
Scriptures are used many times in the Holy
Writings. Besides these there are expressions
such as the "Holy Scriptures" (Rom. 1:2),
"the Scriptures of the prophets" (Matt.
26:56), "the Scripture of truth" (Dan.
10:21).

  2. What other terms are used to
designate the written revelation from
heaven? Eph. 6:17; Heb. 5:12; Acts
7:38.

                 The Call                        "chief" is in other places rendered "judge"
                                                 and "governor."
  1. What provision for leadership
did God make in the apostolic church?              2. What were some of the terms
1 Cor. 12:28.                                    used to designate the leaders of the
                                                 apostolic church? Eph. 4:11; Acts

             THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
              March 28, 1953—Far Eastern Division
    The overflow from the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering on March 28
will go to the Far Eastern Division to help in providing essential build-
ings and equipment in three major educational institutions:
    i. Japan Missionary College, near Tokyo. This is our only secondary
or collegiate school in Japan, and it is badly handicapped by a lack of
essential buildings and equipment.
    2. The North Celebes Training School in the Indonesia Union. This
school has several incomplete buildings which must be finished before
it can function efficiently.
    3. The new junior college now being started on the island of Min-
danao. This college will meet an urgent need for educational facilities
in the newly organized South Philippine Union Mission.
