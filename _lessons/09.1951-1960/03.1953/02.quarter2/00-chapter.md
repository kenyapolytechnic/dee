                We may learn much from the lives of truly great men.
            Biography, especially when penned under the guidance of
            the Holy Spirit, is an inspiring and ennobling study, for
            it directly tends to reproduce in the lives of the students
            the excellencies which it records. The successes and
            achievements of the patriarchs, together with their faults
            and failures, are alike profitable to us ; for, in the lan-
            guage of the apostle Paul: "All these things happened
            unto them for ensamples : and they are written for our
            admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come."
            1 Cor. 10:11.

                  THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
                   June 27, 1953—Southern European Division
   Two Macedonian needs of the Southern European Division call for a
liberal Thirteenth Sabbath Offering overflow on June 27:
   1. In beautiful Sicily, where our work in the Italian Union Mission field
has found its most fertile soil, we have but one small chapel for our 425 mem-
bers and their numerous children, and only a small handful of ministers and
Bible workers to labor among the island's four million inhabitants. Our peo-
ple there are earnest, zealous, and sacrificing, but most of them—like the
majority of Sicilians—are poor. We must help them so they will no longer
have to meet in small, unsanitary halls and rooms, and so there will be salaries
for their fine young people now preparing for work in God's service in 'their
country. We should also help them to undertake some medical work'in their
 needy almost-mission field and to establish some church schools for the many
"lambs" of their "flock."
    2. Little, so far, has been done by our people for the millions of Moham-
medans in North Africa. Many of them have lost practically all but the
formal shell of their religion; others have turned to Maraboutism, a perver-
sion of their own religion, and almost worship their deceased holy men, or
 Marabouts; still others, unsatisfied with what they have, are reaching out for
something better. We should send them ministers, teachers, doctors, and
 nurses to live and work among them and to win them to Christ.
