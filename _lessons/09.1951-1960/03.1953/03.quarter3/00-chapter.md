   The Fullness of Time: "When the full-
ness of the time was come, God sent forth
His Son, . . . to redeem them that were
under the law, that we might receive the
adoption of sons." Gal. 4:4, 5.
  The Saviour's coming was foretold by
patriarchs and prophets down through the
ages. His sacrifice and the shedding of His
blood were revealed in every offering that
was slain. The prophecy of Daniel fore-
told the exact time of His crucifixion. But
with the passing of the centuries the peo-
ple had almost lost hope. They exclaimed,
"The days are prolonged, and every vision
faileth." Ezek. 12:22. Finally, when He

              Introduction                     What was the precious price that was

sold into bondage. We are in abject slav-

our redemption. He alone is able to rescue       NorE.—"All men have been bought with

                 THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
            September 26, 1953—Southern African Division
    The Southern African Division will receive the Thirteenth Sabbath Offer-
ing overflow on September 26. Elder R. S. Watts, president of the division•,
writes: "We have eagerly looked forward to being the recipients of this special
offering. The previous offering overflow for the Southern African Division
was received at the end of the first quarter of 1951 and brought this division
the very welcome amount of $44,099.71, which was used to help provide new
buildings for the Cuale school in Angola, the Kasai training 'school in the
Congo, and the Malamulo hospital in Nyasaland. Again we have two very
needy and worthy projects for which the overflow at the end of this quarter •
will be used; namely, the Kendu hospital in East Africa, and the Yuka hospi-
tal in Barotseland.
    "Several years ago the administration building for the Kendu hospital
was started, but because of lack of funds it still stands unfinished. We are
hoping the overflow this quarter will enable us not only to complete this
building, but also to erect an additional much-needed ward. Our Yuka hospi-
 tal has already been started. It will be the only hospital in the western part of
Barotseland, and its influence will be felt for. many, many miles around."
