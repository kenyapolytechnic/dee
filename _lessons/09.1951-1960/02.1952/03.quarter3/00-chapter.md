                        THE HOLY SPIRIT


                         Lesson 1, for July 5, 1952

       Personality and Deity of the Holy Spirit
  MEMORY VERSE: "Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy
Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?" 1 Cor. 6:19.
  STUDY HELP: W. H. Branson, "The Holy Spirit," chapter 1.

                          DAILY STUDY ASSIGNMENT
1. General survey of the lesson;             4. Questions 7-10.
     memorize 1 Cor. 6:19.                   5. Read "The Holy Spirit," chapter 1.
2. Questions 1-4.                            6. Questions 11-13.
3. Questions 5, 6.                           7. Review the entire lesson.


                               A Divine Mystery
   1. How inadequate is the unaided human mind to, understand
the Godhead? Rom. 11:33, 34; Isa. 40:28.

   NoTE.—"Man cannot by searching find out God. Let none seek with pre-
sumptuous hand to lift the veil that conceals His glory. `Unsearchable are
His judgments, and His ways past finding out.' It is a proof of His mercy
that there is the hiding of His power; for to lift the veil that conceals the
divine presence is death. No mortal mind can penetrate the secrecy in which
the Mighty One dwells and works. Only that which He sees fit to reveal
can we comprehend of Him. Reason must acknowledge an authority
superior to itself. Heart and intellect must bow to the great I AM."—The
Ministry of Healing, page 438.
   2. How many persons comprise the eternal Godhead? Matt.
28:19.
    NoTE.—"There are three living persons of the heavenly trio; in the name
of these three great powers—the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit—
those who receive Christ by living faith are baptized, and these powers will
co-operate with the obedient subjects of heaven in their efforts to live the
new life in Christ."—Special Testimonies, Series B, No. 7, p. 63.
    "The Godhead, or Trinity, consists of the Eternal Father, a personal,
spiritual Being, omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient, infinite in wisdom and
love; the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Eternal Father, through whom
all things were created and through whom the salvation of the redeemed
hosts will be accomplished; the Holy Spirit, the third person of the Godhead,
the great regenerating power in the work of redemption. (Matt. 28:19.)"—
Church Manual, page 29.
                                         3
   3. How much of the mystery surrounding the personality of
the Father, Son, and thq Holy Spirit is open to our study? Deut.
29:29; 1 Cor. 2:11, 12.

   NoTE.—"The revelation of Himself that God has given in His word is for
our study. This we may seek to understand. But beyond this we are not to
penetrate. The highest intellect may tax itself until it is wearied out in con-
jectures regarding the nature of God; but the effort will be fruitless. This
problem has not been given us to solve. No human mind can comprehend
God. Let not finite man attempt to interpret Him. Let none indulge in
speculation regarding His nature. Here silence is eloquence. The Omniscient
One is above discussion."—Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 279.
   4. What attribute of Deity belongs to the Holy Spirit? Heb.
9:14. See also 1 Tim. 1:17.

   ANSWER:    He, like the Father and Son, is eternal.

                     Personality of the Holy Spirit

   5. What Scriptural evidence do we have of the personality of
the Holy Spirit? John 14:26.

   NOTE.—"It is not essential for us to be able to define just what the Holy
Spirit is. Christ tells us that the Spirit is the Comforter, 'the Spirit of truth,
which, proceedeth from the Father.' It is plainly declared regarding the Holy
Spirit, that in His work of guiding men into all ,truth, 'He shall not speak
of Himself.'"—The Acts of the Apostles, page 51.
   "The Spirit of God certainly acts as a person and is presented to us as a
person, throughout the Old Testament. In no passage is He conceived other-
wise than personally—as a free, willing, intelligent being."—Benjamin B.
Warfield, Biblical Doctrines, page 125.
  6. How do the words of Peter to Ananias show that the Holy
Spirit is a divine Person? Acts 5:3, 4.

                      Activities of the Holy Spirit
   7. What are some of the personal activities of the Holy Spirit?
John 16:7, 8, 13.
    NoTE.—"The Spirit is constantly seeking to draw the attention of men to
the great offering that was made on the cross of Calvary, to unfold to the
world the love of God, and to open to the convicted soul the precious things
of the Scriptures.
    "Having brought conviction of sin, and presented before the mind the
standard of righteousness, the Holy Spirit withdraws the affections from the
things of this earth, and fills the soul with a desire for holiness. 'He will
guide you into all truth,' the Saviour declared. If men are willing to be
molded, there will be brought about a sanctification of the whole being. The
                                       4
Spirit will take the things of God and stamp them on the soul. By His power
the way of life will be made so plain that none need err therein."—The Acts
of the Apostles, pages 52, 53.

   8. What works of Deity are performed by tRe Holy Spirit?

   ANSWER: (a) He speaks as God. 2 Sam. 23:2, 3.
   (b) He convicts of sin, righteousness, judgment. John 16:8-11.
   (c) He guides in church affairs. Acts 13:2-4.

   9. Who searches and tries the heart of man? 1 Thess. 2:4; Rev.
2:18, 23; 1 Cor. 2:9-11.

  NOTE.—The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit—the fullness of the
Godhead—are unitedly engaged in the divine work of redemption.
   10. What part is acted by the Holy Spirit in conversion? Rev.
22:17; 1 Cor. 6:11.

              The Dwelling Place of the Holy Spirit
  11. What earthly dwelling place is provided for the Holy
Spirit? 1 Cor. 3:16, 17; 6:19.

    NoTE.—"As at Jerusalem the holy of holies, though it contained no image
of God, was for Israel the divine dwelling place on earth; so the Christian
congregation in every place where the church had been planted, and even
the body of the individual believer, had become a holy place, a sanctuary of
the divine Spirit which dwells in the Ecclesia collectively and in its members
as individuals. Both collectively and individually believers are in virtue of
their baptism consecrated shrines of the presence of God, and in both capaci-
ties it is laid upon them to guard the sanctity of the divine abode."—H. B.
Swete, The Holy Spirit in the New Testament, pages 180, 181.
    "From eternal ages it was God's purpose that every created being, from
the bright and holy seraph to man, should be a temple for the indwelling of
the Creator. Because of sin, humanity ceased to be a temple for God.
Darkened and defiled by evil, the heart of man no longer revealed the glory
of the divine One. But by the incarnation of the Son of God, the purpose of
Heaven is fulfilled. God dwells in humanity, and through saving grace the
heart of man becomes again His temple. . . . His presence will cleanse and
sanctify the soul, so that it may be a holy temple unto the Lord, and 'an
habitation of God through the Spirit.' "—The Desire of Ages, pages 161, 162.

   12. What threefold assurance does Jesus give of the divine
presence in the heart of the believer? John 14:16-18, 23.
    NOTE.—"Those who see Christ in His true character, and receive Him into
the heart, have everlasting life. It is through the Spirit that Christ dwells
in us; and the Spirit of God, received into the heart by faith, is the beginning
of the life eternal."—The Desire of Ages, page 388.
                                      [6 1
   13. In what words does Scripture record the Holy Spirit's final
gracious call to men? Rev. 22:17.
     NOTE.—"The same divine mind that is working upon the things of na-
ture is speaking to the hearts of men, and creating an inexpressible craving
for something they have not. The things of the world cannot satisfy their
longing. The Spirit of God is pleading with them to seek for those things
that alone can give peace and rest,—the grace of Christ, the joy of holiness.
. . . To all these souls, who are vainly seeking to drink from the broken
cisterns of this world, the divine message is addressed, 'Let him that is
athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.' "—
Steps to Christ, pages 31, 32.


                     Lesson 2, for July 12, 1952

           The Holy Spirit and the Scriptures
    MEMORY VERSE: "For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man:
but holy men of God spake as they were movedlay the Holy Ghost." 2 Peter 1:21.
   STUDY HELP: W. H. Branson, "The Holy Spirit," chapter 2.
                          DAILY STUDY ASSIGNMENT
1. General survey of the lesson;        4. Read "The Holy Spirit," chapter 2.
     memorize 2 Peter 1:21.             S. Questions 8-10.
2. Questions 1-4.                       6. Questions 11-14.
3. Questions 5-7.                       7. Review the entire lesson.

          The Scriptures and Their Divine Authorship
   1. What is comprehended by the term "Scriptures"? Luke 24:
27, 44, 45; 2 Peter 3:16.

    NorE.—"Beginning at Moses, the very Alpha of Bible history, Christ ex-
pounded in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself. Had He first
made Himself known to them, their hearts would have been satisfied. In the
fullness of their joy they would have hungered for nothing more. But it was
necessary for them to understand the witness borne to Him by the types and
prophedes of the Old Testament. Upon these their faith must be established.
Christ performed no miracle to convince them, but it was His first work to
explain the Scriptures. They had looked upon His death as the destruction
of all their hopes. Now He showed from the prophets that this was the very
strongest evidence for their faith."—The Desire of Ages, pages 796, 799.
  2. Give examples of Scripture authorship by the Holy Spirit.
Acts 1:16; 28:25-28; Heb. 3:7, 8.

   3. What does the apostle Paul say about the authorship of the
Scriptures? 2 Tim. 3:16, 17.

   NoTE.—"The idea that certain portions of the Bible cannot be understood
has led to neglect of some of its most important truths. The fact needs to be
                                       6
emphasized, and often repeated, that the mysteries of the Bible are not such
because God has sought to conceal truth, but because our own weakness or
ignorance makes us incapable of comprehending or appropriating truth. The
limitation is not in His purpose, but in our capacity. Of those very portions
of Scripture often passed by as impossible to be understood, God desires us
to understand as much as our minds are capable of receiving. 'All Scripture
is given by inspiration of God,' that we may be 'throughly furnished unto
all good works.'"—Education, page 171.
   4. How were the Holy Scriptures given? 2 Peter 1:21.

    NoTE.—"The scribes of God wrote as they were dictated by the Holy
Spirit, having no control of the work themselves. They penned the literal
truth, and stern, forbidding facts are revealed for reasons that our finite minds
cannot fully comprehend. It is one of the best evidences of the authenticity
of the Scriptures that the truth is not glossed over, nor the sins of its chief
characters suppressed."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 9.

          Preservation and Fulfillment of the Scriptures
  5. How were the prophecies and divine messages preserved?
Hab. 2:2; Jer. 36:1, 2; Deut. 10:4, 5.

   6. How closely were these Old Testament prophecies related
to the earthly, life of the Saviour? Matt. 1:22; 2:15, 23; 4:14; 8:17.
Compare 1 Peter 1:11.

   NOTE.-"It is the voice of Christ that speaks through patriarchs and
prophets, from the days of Adam even to the closing scenes of time. The
Saviour is revealed in the Old Testament as clearly as in the New. It is the
light from the prophetic past that brings out the life of Christ and the teach-
ings of the New Testament with dearness and beauty. The miracles of
Christ are a proof of His divinity; but a stronger proof that He is the world's
Redeemer is found in comparing the prophecies of the Old Testament with
the history of the New."—The Desire of Ages, pages 799.
   7. What authority did Jesus constantly use? Matt. 4:1-10; 21:
42; Mark 7:6.

   NoTE.—"Jesus met Satan with the words of Scripture. 'It is written,' He
said. In every temptation the weapon of His warfare was the word of God.
Satan demanded of Christ a miracle as a sign of His divinity. But that
which is greater than all miracles, a firm reliance upon a 'thus saith the Lord,'
was a sign that could not be controverted. So long as Christ held to this
position, the tempter could gain no advantage."—The Desire of Ages, page
120.

                      Testimony of the Scriptures
    8. Of whom do the Scriptures testify? John 5:39.
                                       [7]
   NoTE.—"Jesus said of the Old Testament Scriptures,—and how much
more is it true of the New,—`They are they which testify of Me,' the Re-
deemer, Him in whom our hopes of eternal life are centered. Yes, the whole
Bible tells of Christ. From the first record of creation,—for 'without Him
was not anything made that was made,'—to the closing promise, 'Behold,
I come quickly,' we are reading of His works and listening to His voice. If
you would become acquainted with the Saviour, study the Holy Scriptures."
—Steps to Christ, pages 92, 93.
   9. Of whom does the Holy Spirit testify? John 15:26.

   10. What should be our attitude to the testimony of the Scrip-
tures? 2 Chron. 20:20, last part; 1 Thess. 2:13.
                        Power of the Scriptures
   11. What effective weapon is wielded by the Holy Spirit? Heb.
4:12.

   12. In Paul's admonition to Timothy, what saving power does
he attribute to the Scriptures? 2 Tim. 3:15.

   13. By what powers are the new birth and sanctification ef-
fected? John 3:5; 1 Peter 1:23; Eph. 5:26.

    N0TE.—"What Jesus said in justification of His doctrine of the new birth
is equally applicable to the doctrine of inspiration: 'That which is born of
the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is .spirit.' Educate,
develop, and refine the natural man to the highest possible point, and yet he
is not a spiritual man till, through the new birth, the Holy Ghost renews
and indwells him. So of literature; however elevated its tone, however lofty
its thought, it is not Scripture. Scripture is literature indwelt by the Spirit
of God. The absence of the Holy Ghost from any writing constitutes the
impassable gulf between it and Scripture. Our Lord, in speaking of His own
doctrine, uses the same language, to show its separateness from common
teaching which He employs above to mark the distinction of the new man.
He says: 'It is the Spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing; the
words that I have spoken unto you are spirit, and are life.' (John 6:63, R.V.)"
—A. J. Gordon, The Ministry of the Spirit, pages 169, 170.
  14. In what service of consolation are the Scriptures and the
Holy Spirit united? Acts 9:31; Rom. 15:4.

                        Lesson 3, for July 19, 1952

       The Holy Spirit From Creation to Christ
   MEMORY VERSE: "And I will put My Spirit within you, and cause you to
walk in My statutes, and ye shall keep My judgments, and do them." Ezek. 36:27.

                          DAILY STUDY ASSIGNMENT
1. General survey of the lesson;             4. Questions 6-9.
     memorize Ezek. 36:27.                   5. Questions 10-12.
2. Questions 1-3.                            6. Questions 13, 14.
3. Questions 4, 5.                           7. Review the entire lesson.

                           Holy Spirit in Creation
  1. How early in the creation story do we find the Spirit of
God mentioned? Gen. 1:2.

  2. How does Job speak of the Spirit as an active associate in the
work of creation? Job 26:13.

   3. What particular act of creation indicates that man was made
to be a temple of the Holy Spirit? Gen. 1:27; 2:7. Compare John
20:22; 1 Cor. 6:19.

   NOTE.—"Through Christ was to be fulfilled the purpose of which the
tabernacle was a symbol,—that glorious building, its walls of glistening gold
reflecting in rainbow hues the curtains inwrought with cherubim, the
fragrance of ever-burning incense pervading all, the priests robed in spotless
white, and in the deep mystery of the inner place, above the mercy seat,
between the figures of the bowed, worshiping angels, the glory of the Holiest.
In all, God desired His people to read His purpose for the human soul. It
was the same purpose long afterward set forth by the apostle Paul, speaking
by the Holy Spirit:
   " 'Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God
dwelleth in you? If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy;
for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.' "—Education, page 36.
  4. Long before the birth of Christ, what characteristic of the
Spirit had been made known? Ps. 139:7-10; 104:30.

   NoTE.—"The greatness of God is to us incomprehensible. The Lord's
throne is in heaven;' yet by His Spirit He is everywhere present. He has
an intimate knowledge of, and a personal interest in, all the works of His
hand."—Education, page 132.
  5. Before the Flood, against whom did the antediluvians rebel?
Gen. 6:3.
                                      [9 ]
                  Qualification for Leadership
   6. What convinced Pharaoh that Joseph was a fit man for high
office in Egypt? Gen. 41:38.
   NorE.—"In all the realm, Joseph was the only man gifted with wisdom
to point out the danger that threatened the kingdom, and the preparation
necessary to meet it; and the king was convinced that he was the one best
qualified to execute the plans which he had proposed. It was evident that a
divine power was with him, and that there were none among the king's
officers of state so well qualified to conduct the affairs of the nation at this
crisis. The fact that he was a Hebrew and a slave, was of little moment
when weighed against his evident wisdom and sound judgment."—Patriarchs
and Prophets, page 221.
   7. When God directed Moses to share his responsibilities with
other leaders, what special provision did He make? Num. 11:16,
17, 24, 25.
  8. When the tabernacle was to be built, who was appointed as
master workman, and how was he fitted for his duties? Ex. 31:1-5.
    NorE.—"The skillful touch of the physician's hand, his power over nerve
and muscle, his knowledge of the delicate organism of the body, is the wis-
dom of divine power, to be used in behalf of the suffering. The skill with
which the carpenter uses the hammer, the strength with which the black-
smith makes the anvil ring, comes from God. He has entrusted men with
talents, and He expects them to look to Him for counsel. Whatever we do,
in whatever department of the work we are placed, He desires to control
our minds, that we may do perfect work."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 349.
   9. What distinguished Caleb and Joshua from the unbelieving
spies? Num. 14:22-24; 27:18.
                           Essential to Victory
    10. What was the great concern of David as he yearned for a
life of victory? Ps. 51:11.

blessing to Israel? Isa. 63:10.
  12. How does the prophet Isaiah predict the future work of the
Holy Spirit in the life and ministry of Christ? Isa. 11:1, 2; 61:1-3.
            Fullness of Blessing Foretold for Last Days
   13. How does the prophet Joel envision the activities of the
Holy Spirit in the last days? Joel 2:28, 29. Compare Acts 2:16-19.
See The Acts of the Apostles, page 54, last paragraph.
                                110]
   14. What victorious experience does Ezekiel declare will come
to God's people? Ezek. 36:26; 27.

    NoTE.—"Every time a soul is converted, and learns to love God and keep
His commandments, the promise of God is fulfilled, 'A new heart also will I
give you, and a new spirit will I put within you.' The change in human
hearts, the transformation of human characters, is a miracle that reveals an
ever-living Saviour, working to rescue souls. A consistent life in Christ is a
great miracle. In the preaching of the word of God, the sign that should be
manifest now and always is the presence of the Holy Spirit, to make the word
a regenerating power to those that hear. This is God's witness before the
world to the divine mission of His Son."—The Desire of Ages, page 407.

   NorE.—"In these words is announced the fulfillment of the purpose that
had been hidden from eternal ages. Christ was about to visit our world,
and to become incarnate. He says, 'A body hast Thou prepared Me.' Had
He appeared with the glory that was His with the Father before the world
was, we could not have endured the light of His presence. That we might
behold it and not be destroyed, the manifestation of His glory was shrouded.
His divinity was veiled with humanity,—the invisible glory in the visible
human form."—The Desire of Ages, page 23.
  3. By what divine agency did Mary become the mother of
Christ? Luke 1:34, 35.
                 Christ Identified With Humanity

Heb. 2:14-18.

    NOTE.—"Taking humanity upon Him, Christ came to be one with hu-
manity and at the same time to reveal our heavenly Father to sinful human
beings. He was in all things made like unto His brethren. He became flesh,
even as we are. He was hungry and thirsty and weary. He was sustained
by food and refreshed by sleep. He shared the lot of men, and yet He was
the blameless Son of God. He was a stranger and sojourner on the earth—in
the world, but not of the world; tempted and tried as men and women today
are tempted and tried, yet living a life free from sin."—Testimonies, vol. 8,
p. 286.

  5. What human experiences and trials was Jesus called upon to
endure? Heb. 4:15; Isa. 53:3, 4; John 4:6; Mark 4:38.

  6. When. Jesus was baptized, what was seen to descend upon
Him? Matt. 3:16, 17.

   NoTE.—"Of the vast throng at the Jordan, few except John discerned
the heavenly vision. Yet the solemnity of the divine Presence rested upon
the assembly. The people stood silently gazing upon Christ. His form was
bathed in the light that ever surrounds the throne of God. His upturned face
was glorified as they had never before seen the face of man. From the open
heavens a voice was heard saying, 'This is My beloved Son, in whom I am
well pleased.' . . . John recognized the token which God had promised. He
knew that it was the world's Redeemer whom he had baptized. The Holy
Spirit rested upon him, and with outstretched hand pointing to Jesus, he
cried, 'Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.' "
—The Desire of Ages, page 112.

                       His Spirit-Filled Ministry

    7. What does Luke declare regarding the Holy Spirit in the life
of the Saviour? Luke 4:1; Acts 10:38.

    NOTE.—"Jesus lived in dependence upon God and communion with Him.
To the secret place of the Most High, under the shadow of the Almighty,
men now and then repair; they abide for a season, and the result is manifest
in noble deeds; then their faith fails, the communion is interrupted, and the
lifework marred. But the life of Jesus was a life of constant trust, sustained
by continual communion; and His service for heaven and earth was without
failure or faltering.
    "As a man He supplicated the throne of God, till His humanity was
charged with a heavenly current that connected humanity with divinity.
Receiving life from God, He imparted life to men."—Education, pages 80, 81.
                                      [ 12 ]
  8. During the wilderness temptation, to what authority did
Christ constantly appeal? Matt. 4:4, 7, 10. What is the word of
God said to be? Eph. 6:17.


    NorE.—"The work of the Holy Spirit is to enlighten the darkened under-
standing, to melt the selfish, stony heart, to subdue the rebellious transgressor,
and save him from the corrupting influences of the world. The prayer of
Christ for His disciples was: 'Sanctify them through Thy .truth ; Thy word
is truth.' The sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, pierces the
heart of the sinner and cuts it in pieces."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 441.

   9. What power enabled the Saviour to cast out devils? Matt.
12:28, 29.

   NorE.—"The Pharisees had reiterated the charge, 'He casteth out devils
through the prince of the devils.' Christ told them plainly that in attributing
the work of the Holy Spirit to Satan, they were cutting themselves off from
the fountain of blessing. Those who had spoken against Jesus Himself, not
discerning His divine character, might receive forgiveness; for through the
Holy Spirit they might be brought to see their error and repent. . . . They
[the Jewish leaders] were convinced that a divine power attended Christ,
but in order to resist the truth, they attributed the work of the Holy Spirit
to Satan. In doing this they deliberately chose deception; they yielded them-
selves to Satan, and henceforth they were controlled by his power."—The
Desire of Ages, pages 321, 322.

  10. In the Nazareth synagogue how did Jesus speak of His
Spirit-filled ministry? Luke 4:18, 19.

            Enabling Power in Death and Resurrection
   11. What do the Scriptures say regarding the power manifested
in the resurrection of Jesus from the dead? 1 Peter 3:18; Rom. 8:11.

   12. To whom did Jesus continually refer as His director in all
things? John 5:19; 6:57; 10:25.

   NoTE.—"Consider the life of Christ. Standing at the head of humanity,
serving His Father, He is an example of what every son should and may be.
The obedience that Christ rendered God requires from human beings today.
He served His Father with love, in willingness and freedom.            delight to
do Thy will, 0 My God,' He declared; 'yea, Thy law is within My heart.'
Christ counted no sacrifice too great, no toil too hard, in order to accomplish
the work which He came to do. At the age of twelve He said, Wist ye not
that I must be about My Father's business?' He had heard the call, and had
taken up the work. 'My meat,' He said, 'is to do the will of Him that sent
Me, and to fini511 HiS work,' "—Christ's Object Lessons, pages 282, 283.
                                     [ 13
   13. What, therefore, was the relationship of the Father and
the Holy Spirit to the earthly life and work of the Son? John
10:30; 16:13, 14.

   NOTE.—The Trinity—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—are united in a su-
preme effort to save the lost race.

         The Comforter—a New Relationship
   MEMORY VERSE: "He shall glorify Me: for He shall receive of Mine,       and
shall show it unto you." John 16:14.
   STUDY HELP: W. H. Branson, "The Holy Spirit," chapter 4.
                          DAILY STUDY ASSIGNMENT
1. General survey of the lesson;        4. Read "The Holy Spirit," chapter 4.

                    Related in Nature and Work
   1. What did Jesus tell the woman of Samaria regarding the
nature of God? John 4:24.

    Nork.—"The mighty power that works through all nature and sustains
all things is not, as some men of science represent, merely an all-pervading
principle, an actuating energy. God is a spirit; yet He is a personal being,
for man was made in His image."—Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 263.
    "From the beginning God has been working by His Holy Spirit through
human instrumentalities for the accomplishment of His purpose in behalf
of the fallen race. This was manifest in the lives of the patriarchs. To the
church in the wilderness also, in the time of Moses, God gave His 'good Spirit
to instruct them.' "—The Acts of the Apostles, page 53.
   2. How did Jesus speak of His relationship to God the Father?
John 10:15, 30; Matt. 11:27.

   3. What may be said of the work of the Spirit in co-operation
with the Father and Son? 1 Peter 1:2.

    NorE.—"The religion that comes from God is the only religion that will
lead to God. In order to serve Him aright, we must be born of the divine
Spirit. This will purify the heart and renew the mind, giving us a new
capacity for knowing and loving God. It will give us a willing obedience to
all His requirements. This is true worship. It is the fruit Of the working
of the Holy Spirit."—The Desire of Ages, page 189,
                                     [ 14 3
  4. How had the Holy Spirit been manifested during the earthly
mission of Christ? John 3:34, 35; Luke 3:22.

   NOTE.—"In this glory of Christ all His followers are to share. The
Saviour could say, 'I seek not Mine own will, but the will of the Father
which hath, sent. Me.' And John declared, 'God giveth not the Spirit by
measure unto Him.' So with the followers of Christ. We can receive of
heaven's light only as we are willing to be emptied of self. We can discern
the character of God, and accept Christ by faith, only as we consent to the
bringing into captivity of every thought to the obedience of Christ. And
to all who do this, the Holy Spirit is given without measure. In Christ
`dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily. And ye are complete in
Him.' "—Gospel Workers, page 57.

   5. How did the disciples feel when Jesus spoke of leaving
them? John 16:5, 6.

    NOTE.—"They knew that His personal presence was no longer to be with
them, and they recognized, as they had never recognized before, the value
of the opportunities that had been theirs to walk and talk with the Sent of
God. Many of His lessons, when spoken, they had not appreciated or under-
stood; now they longed to recall these lessons, to hear again His words."—
Education, page 94.
 • 6. As the time approached for Jesus to return to His Father,
what announcement was made to the disciples? John 16:7, first
part.

                      CoMing of the Comforter

   7. What advantage would be enjoyed as a result of, the Saviour's
departure? John 16:7, last part.

   NoTE.—"The Holy Spirit is Christ's representative, but divested of the
personality of humanity, and independent thereof. Cumbered with humanity,
Christ could not be in every place personally. Therefore it was for their
interest that He should go to the Father, and send the Spirit to be His suc-
cessor on earth. No one could then have any advantage because of his loca-
tion or his personal contact with Christ. By the Spirit the Saviour would
be accessible to all. In this sense He would be nearer to them than if He
had not ascended on high."—The Desire of Ages, page 669.

   8. Who is the Comforter said to be? John 14:26.

   NoTE.—At Pentecost "the Spirit came upon the waiting, praying disciples
with a fullness that reached every heart. The Infinite One revealed Himself in
power to His church. It was as if for ages this influence had been held in
restraint, and now Heaven rejoiced in being able to pour out upon the church
the riches of the Spirit's grace."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 38.
                                     [ 15]
   9. What change took place in the relation of the Holy Spirit
to mankind when Jesus was glorified? John 16:13, 14; 15:26.
    IsTarE.—"When Christ passed within the heavenly gates, He was en-
throned amidst the adoration of the angels. As soon as this ceremony was
completed, the Holy Spirit descended upon the disciples in rich currents,
and Christ was indeed glorified, even with the glory which He had with
the Father from all eternity. The Pentecostal outpouring was Heaven's com-
munication that the Redeemer's inauguration was accomplished. According
to His promise He had sent the Holy Spirit from heaven to His followers,
as a token that He had, as priest and king, received all authority in heaven
and on earth, and was the Anointed One over His people."—The Acts of the
Apostles, pages 38,39.
  10. In what capacity was the Holy Spirit to be revealed to the
church? John 14:26.

   NOTE.—"Thus it is clearly revealed by a multitude of witnesses that
henceforth the presence of the Spirit in the church, or in the heart of the
believer, was to be as the very presence of Jesus Himself. He comes in
Jesus's name, speaks Jesus's words, ministers Jesus's life to the heart, carries
on Jesus's work, and testifies of Jesus's power in working out our salvation.
So Paul could truly say, 'Christ liveth in me,' although the personal Christ
was seated at the right hand of the Father in heaven.
   "It was in this sense that the Holy Ghost had not been given before
Pentecost. He was to assume an entirely new relationship, taking Christ's
place as head of the church upon earth, while Christ ascended to take up His
work as our great high Priest in the sanctuary above, and to act as our ad-
vocate before the Father. Thus He could be personally present with the
Father, and at the same time spiritually present with every believer."—The
Holy Spirit, page 46.
   11. How are we made children of God? Rom. 8:14-16.

   12. With whom does the Lord dwell? Isa. 57:15.


                     Lesson 6, for August 9, 1952
                     The Comforter at Work
   MEMORY VERSE: "But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the
Father will send in My name, He shall teach you all things, and bring all things to
your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you." John 14:26.

                    The Abiding Presence Within
   1. How permanent was the gift of the Comforter to be? John
14:16.

   2. In addition to abiding with the believer, what still closer
relationship is assured? John 14:17.

    NorE.—"Henceforth through the Spirit, Christ was to abide continually
in the hearts of His children. Their union with Him was closer than when
He was personally with them. The light, and love, and power of the in-
dwelling Christ shone out through them, so that men, beholding, 'marveled;
and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.' "—Steps
to Christ, page 80.
  3. To what extent would the Comforter carry on the work
which Christ had begun? John 14:26.

                             Convicts of Sin
   4. As enumerated by Jesus, what is the first of the three vital
services which the Comforter renders to the world in general?
John 16:8.

   .NorE.—"Man is responsible for receiving or rejecting sacred and eternal
truth. The Spirit of God is continually convicting, and souls are deciding
for or against the truth. How important, then, that every act of life be
such that it need not be repented of, especially among the ambassadors of
Christ, who are acting in His stead !"—Gospel Workers, page 174.
  5. What instrument is used by the Holy Spirit in convincing
men of sin? Ps. 19:7; Rom. 3:20; 7:7.

    NoTE.—"In the new birth the heart is brought into harmony with God,
as it is brought into accord with His law. When this mighty change has taken
place in the sinner, he has passed from death unto life, from sin unto holiness,
from transgression and rebellion to obedience and loyalty. The old life of
alienation from God has ended; the new life of reconciliation, of faith and
love, has begun. Then 'the righteousness of the law' will 'be fulfilled in us,
who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.' "—The Great Controversy,
page 468.
   6. How was Jesus enabled to bring deliverance to the con-
victed sinner? Luke 4:18.

               Establishes Righteousness in the Heart
  7. What does Jesus enumerate as the second work of the
Comforter? John 16:8, 10.
                                      [ 17 ]
   8. How was this work of righteousness, or regeneration, ex-
plained to Nicodemus? John 3:3-7.

   NorE.—"Jesus laid bare the foundation principles of truth. He said- to
Nicodemus, It is not theoretical knowledge you need so much as spiritual
regeneration. You need not to have your curiosity satisfied, but to have a
new heart. You must receive a new life from above before you can am
preciate heavenly things."—The Desire of Ages, page 171.
   "There is no safety for one who has merely a legal religion, a form of
godliness. The Christian's life is not a modification or improvement of the
old, but a transformation of nature. There is a death to self and sin, and a
new life altogether. This change can be brought about only by the effectual
working of the Holy Spirit."—Ibid., p. 172.

   9. When the righteousness of Christ has been accepted through
the ministry of the Holy Spirit, what does the body of the believer
become? 1 Cor. 6:19; Gal. 2:20.

   NoTE.—"He whose body is the temple of the Holy Spirit will not be en-
slaved by a pernicious habit. His powers belong to Christ, who has bought
him with the price of blood. His property is the Lord's."—The Great Con-
troversy, page 475.
   10. In order to maintain this blessed experience and , to grow
in grace, what is our daily necessity? Luke 9:23; Rom. 6:11.

    Nom—Christ "requires the whole heart, the entire affections. The ex-
hibitions of zeal, earnestness, and unselfish labor which His devoted follow-
ers have given to the world should kindle our ardor and lead us to emulate
their example. Genuine religion gives an earnestness and fixedness of pur-
pose which molds the character to the divine image and enables us to count
all things but loss for the excellency of Christ. This singleness of purpose will
prove an element of tremendous power."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 307.
    "When the light is received and acted upon, you will be crucified to sin,
being dead indeed unto the world, but alive to God. Your idols will be
abandoned, and your example will be on the side of self-denial rather than
that of self-indulgence."—Ibid., p. 436.

                 Convinces of Impending Judgment

  11. What is mentioned as the third accomplishment of the
Comforter? John 16:8, 11.

   12: Who is referred to as the prince of this world? John 12:
31, 32.

    Nors.—"With prophetic eye Christ traced the scenes to take place in His
last great conflict. He knew that when He should exclaim, 'It is finished,' all
heaven would triumph. His ear caught the distant music and the shouts of
                                      [ 18 ]
victory in the heavenly courts. He knew that the knell of Satan's empire
would then be sounded, and the name of Christ would be heralded from
world to world throughout the universe."—The Desire of Ages, page 679.
   13. What event marks the final overthrow of the power of .
evil? Rev. 20:10, 14, 15; Matt. 25:41.

                    The Spirit's Gracious Invitation
   14. In offering to man the riches of God's saving grace, what
invitation is given by the Holy Spirit? Rev. 22:17.

    NOTE.—"The Spirit of God is pleading with them [the hearts of men] to
seek for those things that alone can give peace and rest,—the grace of
Christ, the joy of holiness. Through influences seen and unseen, our Saviour
is constantly at work to attract the minds of men from the unsatisfying
pleasures of sin to the infinite blessings that may be theirs in Him. To all
these souls, who are vainly seeking to drink from the broken cisterns of this
world, the divine message is addressed, 'Let him that is athirst come. And
whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.'"—Steps to Christ,
page 32.

   4. Although a brief visit to the Father had assured Jesus that
His sacrifice was accepted (John 20:17), what period elapsed
between the resurrection and the final ascension? Acts 1:3.

   NoTE.—"Jesus quickly ascended to His Father to hear from His lips
that He accepted the sacrifice, and to receive all power in heaven and upon
earth.
   "Angels like a cloud surrounded the Son of God, and bade the everlasting
gates be lifted up, that the King of glory might come in. I saw that while
Jesus was with that bright heavenly host, in the presence of God, and sur-
rounded by His glory, He did not forget His disciples upon the earth, but
received power from His Father, that He might return and impart power to
them. The same day He returned, and showed Himself to His disciples. He
suffered them then to touch Him ; for He had ascended to His Father, and
had received power."—Early Writings, pages 187, 188.
   5. What took place at Christ's ascension? Mark 16:19; Ps. 24:

   6. What had the disciples been told to do before beginning
their work of witnessing? Acts 1:4, 5.

   7. Upon what Jewish feast day, and how long after the cruci-
fixion, was the promise of the Father fulfilled? Acts 2:1; Lev. 23:
15, 16.
   NoTE.—"Christ arose from the dead as the first fruits of those that slept.
He was the antitype of the wave sheaf, and His resurrection took place on
the very day when the wave sheaf was to be presented before the Lord."—
The Desire of Ages, pages 785, 786.
   "Barley was the earliest grain in Palestine, and at the opening of the
[Passover] feast it was beginning to ripen. A sheaf of this grain was waved
by the priest before the altar of God, as an acknowledgment that all was His.
Not until this ceremony had been performed was the harvest to be gathered.
Fifty days from the offering of first fruits, came the Pentecost, called also
the feast of harvest and the feast of weeks."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
pages 539, 540.
   8. Describe the Pentecostal visitation. Acts 2:1-4.

   NOTE.—"On the Day of Pentecost the Infinite One revealed Himself in
power to the church. By His Holy Spirit He descended from the heights of
heaven as a rushing, mighty wind, to the room in which the disciples were
assembled. It was as if for ages this influence had been held in restraint, and
                                     [20]
now heaven rejoiced in being able to pour upon the church the riches of the
Spirit's power."—Testimonies, vol. 7, p. 31.
  9. How does Peter show that Pentecost was a fulfillment of the
Saviour's promise and a result of His glorification? Acts 2:32, 33.

             Early Rain Prepared for World Witness

   10. For what work was the early church now prepared? Mark
16:15-18; Acts 1:4, 5, 8.

    NOTE.-" 'With great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection
of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all' Under their labors
were added to the church chosen men, who, receiving the word of truth,
consecrated their lives to the work of giving to others the hope that filled
their hearts with peace and joy. They could not be restrained or intimidated
by threatenings. The Lord spoke through them, and as they went from place
to place, the poor had the gospel preached to them, and miracles of divine
grace were wrought."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 48.
   11. What gift enabled the apostles to reach the multitudes
gathered in Jerusalem for the Feast of Pentecost? Acts 2:6-8.

    Nom.—"Every known tongue was represented by those assembled. This
diversity of languages would have been a great hindrance to the proclamation
of the gospel; God therefore in a miraculous manner supplied the deficiency of
the apostles. The Holy Spirit did for them that which they could not have
accomplished for themselves in r lifetime. They could now proclaim the
truths of the gospel abroad, speaking with accuracy the languages of those
for whom they were laboring. This miraculous gift was a strong evidence
to the world that their commission bore the signet of Heaven. From this time
forth the language of the disciples was pure, simple, and accurate, whether
they spoke in their native tongue or in a foreign language."—The Acts of the
Apostles, pages 39, 40.
   12. How many were converted at Pentecost? What other re-
sults followed? Acts 2:41, 43; 4:33-35.

 • 13. What symbol is used in Scripture to illustrate the work of
the Holy Spirit upon the human heart? Ps. 72:6, 7; Joel 2:21-24.

   14. As we think of the work of the church as one of seed sow-
ing and harvest, to what may Pentecost be compared? Joel 2:23.

   NoTE.—"The outpouring of the Spirit in apostolic days was the 'former
rain,' and glorious was the result."—The Desire of Ages, page 827.
   "In the East the former rain falls at the sowing time. It is necessary in,
order that the seed may germinate. Under the influence of the fertilizing
showers, the tender shoot springs up. The latter rain, falling near the close
of the season, ripens the grain, and prepares it for the sickle. The Lord
employs these operations of nature to represent the work of the Holy Spirit.
                                     [ 21 3
As the dew and the rain are given first to cause the seed to germinate, and
then to ripen the harvest, so the Holy Spirit is given to carry forward, from
one stage to another, the process of spiritual growth."—Testimonies to
Ministers, page 506.


                      Lesson 8, for August 23, 1952

       The Apostasy: Loss of the Spirit's Power
   MEMORY VERSE: "And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are
sealed unto the day of redemption." Eph. 4:30.
   STUDY HELP: W. H. Branson, "The Holy Spirit," chapter 7.
                          DAILY STUDY ASSIGNMENT
1. General survey of the lesson;        4. Read "The Holy Spirit," chapter 7.
     memorize Eph. 4:30.                5. Questions 8-10.
2. Questions 1-3.                       6. Questions 11, 12.
3. Questions 4-7.                       7. Review the entire lesson.

                               Apostasy Foretold
  1. Against what danger must the church continually be on
guard? Rev. 2:4, 5.

     Nom.—"Christ ascended to heaven and sent His Holy Spirit to give
power to the work of His disciples. Thousands were converted in a day. In
a single generation the gospel was carried to every nation under heaven. But
little by little 'a change came. The church lost her first love. She became
selfish and ease-loving. The spirit of worldliness was cherished. The enemy
cast his spell upon those to whom God had given light for a world in dark-
ness, light which should have shone forth in good works. The world was
robbed of the blessings that God desired men to receive."—Testimonies,
8, p. 26.
   2. How did the apostles foretell the apostasy that would over-
take the church? 2 Thess. 2:3; 2 Peter 2:1, 2.
    NOTE.—"Almost imperceptibly the customs of heathenism found their
way into the Christian church. The spirit of compromise and conformity was
restrained for a time by the fierce persecutions which the church endured
under paganism. But as persecution ceased, and Christianity entered the
courts and palaces of kings, she laid aside the humble simplicity of Christ
and His apostles for the pomp and pride of pagan priests and rulers; and in
place of the requirements of God, she substituted human theories and tra-
ditions. The nominal conversion of Constantine, in the early part of the
fourth century, caused great rejoicing; and the world, cloaked with a form
of righteousness, walked into the church."—The Great Controversy, pages
49, 50.
   3. What evil work would be done by the man of sin? 2 Thess.
2:3 (last part), 4.
                                       [ 22
   NOTE.—"The work of corruption rapidly progressed. Paganism, while
appearing to be vanquished, became the conqueror. Her spirit controlled the
church. Her doctrines, ceremonies, and superstitions were incorporated into
the faith and worship of the professed followers of Christ.
   "This compromise between paganism and Christianity resulted in the
development of the 'man of sin' foretold in prophecy as opposing and exalt-
ing himself above God. That gigantic system of false religion is a master-
piece of Satan's power,—a monument of his efforts to seat himself upon the
throne to rule the earth according to his will."—The Great Controversy,
page 50.
   4. How does John the revelator describe the work of the
apostate? Rev. 13:5-8.

    NOTE.—"In the sixth century the papacy had become firmly established.
Its seat of power was fixed in the imperial city, and the bishop of Rome was
declared to be the head over the entire church. Paganism had given place to
the papacy. The dragon had given to the beast 'his power, and his seat, and
great authority.' "—The Great Controversy, page 54.
   5. For how long a time would the deceiver exercise his power?
2 Thess. 2:7, 8; Rev. 12:6; 13:5.
                           •
    NOTE.—"Now began, the 1260 years of papal oppression foretold in the
prophecies of Daniel and the Revelation. Christians were forced to choose
either to yield their integrity and accept the papal ceremonies and worship,
or to wear away their lives in dungeons or suffer death by the rack, the
fagot, or the headsman's ax."—The. Great Controversy, page 54.
   6. What will be the fate of those who are without the love of
the truth? 2 Thess. 2:10-12.

   7. Who is our Guide to the truth? John 16:13.

    NorE.—Those, therefore, who have not the love of the truth, whose love
is grown cold, or who have left their first love, are in danger of grieving the
Holy Spirit and losing His guidance.
                   Persecution by Apostate Power

   8. What is prophesied by Daniel regarding this apostate power
as represented by the little horn? Dan. 7:25, R.V.

    NOTE.—"Says Daniel, of the little horn, the papacy, 'He shall think to
change the times and the law' And Paul styled the same power the 'man of
sin,' who was to exalt himself above God. One prophecy is a complement of
the other. Only by changing God's law could the papacy exalt itself above
God; whoever should understandingly keep the law as thus changed would
be giving supreme honor to that power by which the change was made.
Such an act of obedience to papal laws would be a mark of allegiance to the
pope in the place of God. . . .
                                    [ 23 ]
  "The change in the fourth commandment exactly fulfills the prophecy.
For this the only authority claimed is that of the church. Here the papal
power openly sets itself above God."—The Great Controversy, page 446.
   9. What would be done to the truth by this same power? Dan.
8:11, 12.
   10. As a result of a similar apostasy, what had been withheld
from Israel? Jer. 3:1-3.
   11. What will characterize the faithful remnant who endure in
spite of the forces of evil? Who makes war with them? Rev. 12:17.
   NOTE.—"Some who today are living on the earth will see these words
fulfilled. The same spirit that in ages past led men to persecute the true
church, will in the future lead to the pursuance of a similar course toward
those who maintain their loyalty to God. Even now preparations are being
made for this last great conflict."—Prophets and Kings, page 605.
  12. What timely admonitions should be ever before God's
people today? 1 Thess. 5:19; Eph. 4:30.


                    Lesson 9, for August 30, 1952
                           The Lattei Rain
    MEMORY VERSE: "Ask ye of the Lord rain in the time of the latter rain; so
the Lord shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain, to everyone grass
in the field." Zech. 10:1.

2. Questions 1-4.                       6. Questions 12-14.
3. Questions 5-7.                       7. Review the entire lesson.

                      Work of Reform Necessary
  1. What condition will prevail in the last days, calling for a
demonstration of divine power? Isa. 60:2, first part.
   2. How will the church be prepared to disperse the gross dark-
ness of error? Isa. 60:1, 3.
   NOTE.—"The day of deliverance is at hand. 'The eyes of the Lord run to
and fro throughout the whole earth, to show Himself strong in the behalf
                                  L 24 1.
of them whose heart is perfect toward Him' Among all nations, kindreds,
and tongues, He sees men and women who are praying for light and knowl-
edge. Their souls are unsatisfied: long have they fed on ashes. The enemy
of all righteousness has turned them aside, and they grope as blind men.
But they are honest in heart, and desire to learn a better way. . . .
    "The Holy Spirit is implanting the grace of Christ in the heart of many
a noble seeker after truth, quickening his sympathies contrary to his nature,
contrary to his former education. The 'Light, which lighteth every man that
cometh into the world,' is shining in his soul; and this Light, if heeded, will
guide his feet to the kingdom of God."—Prophets and Kings, pages 376, 377.
   3. What work of reform is called for as the end approaches?
Isa. 58:12.

   4. What particular truth is to be emphasized by the last-day
reformers? Isa. 58:13.

    NoTE.—"In the time of the end, every divine institution is to be restored.
The breach made in the law at the time the Sabbath was changed by man, is
to be repaired. God's remnant people, standing before the world as re-
formers, are to show that the law of God is the foundation of all enduring
reform, and that the Sabbath of the fourth commandment is to stand as a
memorial of creation, a constant reminder of the power of God. In clear,
distinct lines they are to present the necessity of obedience to all the pre-
cepts of the Decalogue. Constrained by the love of Christ, they are to co-
operate with Him in building up the waste places. They are to be repairers
of the breach, restorers of paths to dwell in."—Prophets and Kings, page 678.

                  SPeciai Outpouring in Last Days
   5. What prophecy regarding the Holy Spirit was cited by Peter
at Pentecost? Acts 2:16-18; Joel 2:28, 29.

   Nom.—"Joel foretells more explicitly than any other the outpouring of
the Spirit upon all flesh (2:28, 29). This prediction has entitled him to be
called, as he often is, 'the prophet of Pentecost.' "—George L. Robinson, The
Twelve Minor Prophets, pages 38, 39.
   6. Although Joel's prophecy was partially fulfilled at Pentecost,
what indicates that it applies also to the time of the god? Acts 2:19,
20; Joel 2:30, 31.

   7. How does Peter further call attention to a special visitation
of the Spirit shortly before the second coming of Christ? Acts 3:19,
20.

   NoTE.—"I heard those clothed with the armor speak forth the truth with
great power. It had effect. Many had been bound; some wives by their
husbands, and some children by their parents. The honest who had been
prevented from hearing the truth now eagerly laid hold upon it. All fear of
their relatives was gone, and the truth alone was exalted to them. They had
                                      25
been hungering and thirsting for truth; it was dearer and more precious than
life. I asked what had made this great change. An angel answered, 'It is the
latter rain, the refreshing from the presence of the Lord, the loud cry of the
third angel.' "—Early Writings, page 271.

                          The Climactic Event--
  8. What is the culminating event in the work of redemption?
Rev. 1:7.

   9. What will happen to the righteous dead and living when
Jesus comes? 1 Thess. 4:16, 17.

   10. What occurs when all nations are gathered before the
throne of the glorified Redeemer? Matt. 25:31-34.

    NOTE.—"When the Son of man comes, the dead are raised incorruptible,
and the living are changed. By this great change they are prepared to re-
ceive the kingdom; for Paul says, 'Flesh and blood cannot inherit the king-
dom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption' Man in his
present state is mortal, corruptible; but the kingdom of God will be incor-
ruptible, enduring forever. Therefore man in his present state cannot entef
into the kingdom of God. But when Jesus comes, He confers immortality
upon His people; and then He calls them to inherit the kingdom of which
they have hitherto been only heirs."—The Great Controversy, pages 322, 323.
   11. What work will be completed before these thrilling events
take place? Matt. 24:14; Rev. 14:6, 7.

   NorE.—"The whole earth is to be illuminated with the glory of God's
truth. The light is to shine to all lands and all peoples. And it is from
those who have received' the light that it is to shine forth. The daystar has
risen upon us, and we are to flash its light upon the pathway of those in
darkness.
   "A crisis is right upon us. We must now by the Holy Spirit's power pro-
claim the great truths for these last days. It will not be long before everyone
will have heard the warning and made his decision. Then shall the end
come."-Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 24.

                        Preparation to Meet God
   12. What warning by the prophet Zephaniah is given regarding
the needed preparation to meet the Lord? Zeph. 2:1-3.

    Norn.—"I was shown that if God's people make no efforts on their part,
but wait for the refreshing to come upon them and remove their wrongs
and correct their errors; if they depend upon that to cleanse them from
filthiness of the flesh and spirit, and fit them to engage in the loud cry of the
third angel, they will be found wanting. The refreshing or power of God
                                       [26]
comes only on those who have prepared themselves for it by doing the
work which God bids them, namely, cleansing themselves from all filthiness
of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God."—Testimonies,
vol. 1, p. 619.
   13. How are God's professed people admonished by the
prophet Joel to prepare for the day of God? Joel 1:14; 2:17. Com-
pare Rev. 3:18-20.

  14. In response to our appeal for the power needed to do our
part, what does the Lord promise? Joel 2:23.

  . NoTE.—"Christ declared that the divine influence of the Spirit was to be
with His followers unto the end. But the promise is not appreciated as it
should be; and therefore its fulfillment is not seen as it might be. The
promise'of the Spirit isea matter little thought of ; and the result is only what
might be expected—spiritual drought, spiritual darkness, spiritual declension
and death: Minor matters occupy the attention, and the divine power which
is necessary for the growth and prosperity of the church, and which would
bring all other blessings in its train, is lacking, though offered in its infinite
plenitude."—Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 21.

                               The Loud Cry

be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord."

                           The Outcry Against Sin
   1. What message is given to the world preceding the giving of
the loud cry? Rev. 14:6-12.

   NorE.—"The first angel's message of Revelation 14, announcing the hour
of God's judgment, and calling upon men to fear and worship Him, was
designed to separate the professed people of God from the corrupting influ-
ences of the world, and to arouse them to see their true condition of worldli-
ness and backsliding. In this message, God had sent to the church a warning,
which, had it been accepted, would have corrected the evils that were
shutting them away from Him."—The Great Controversy, page 379.
                                         [ 27 ]
   2. What additional impetus is given to the message and work
of the third angel? Rev. 18:1-4.
    NoTE.—"Of Babylon, at the time brought to view in this prophecy, it is
declared, 'Her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her
iniquities.' She has filled up the measure of her guilt, and destruction is about
to fall upon her. But God still has a people in Babylon; and before the
visitation of His judgments, these faithful ones must be called out, that they
`partake not of her sins, and receive not of her plagues.' Hence the move-
ment symbolized by the angel coming down from heaven, lightening the
earth with his glory, and crying mightily with a strong voice, announcing
the sins of Babylon. In connection with his message the call is heard, 'Come
out of her, My people.' These announcements, uniting with the third angel's
message, constitute the final warning to be given to the inhabitants of the
earth."—The Great Controversy, page 604.
  3. How urgently does God call upon His people to give a
warning against sin? Isa. 58:1.
    NOTE.—"The trumpet note of warning must be sounded. We are living
in a fearfully wicked age. The worship of God will become corrupted unless
there are wide-awake men at every post of duty. It is no time now for any
to be absorbed in selfish ease. Not one of the words which God has spoken
must be allowed to fall to the ground."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 517.
  4. Who besides men take part in the final warning against evil?
Rev. 10:1-3; 18:1, 2, 4.

    NOTE.—"I saw angels hurrying to and fro in heaven, descending to the
earth, and again ascending to heaven, preparing for the fulfillment of some
important event. Then I saw another mighty angel commissioned to descend
to the earth, to unite his voice with the third angel, and give power and
force to his message."—Early Writings, page 277.
   5. How far-reaching is to be the influence of the message of the
angel? Rev. 18:1, last part.

    NoTE.—"The glory of God rested upon the patient, waiting saints, and
they fearlessly gave the last solemn warning, proclaiming the fall of Baby-
lon, and calling upon God's people to come out of her that they might
escape her fearful doom.
    "The light that was shed upon the waiting ones penetrated everywhere,
and those in the churches who had any light, who had not heard and re-
jected the three messages, obeyed the call, and left the fallen churches. . . .
A compelling power moved the honest, while the manifestation of the power
of God brought a fear and restraint upon their unbelieving relatives and
friends, so that they dared not, neither had they the power to hinder those
who felt the work of the Spirit of God upon them."—Early Writings, pages
277, 278.
    "During the loud cry, the church, aided by the providential interpositions
of her exalted Lord, will diffuse the knowledge of salvation so abundantly
that light will be communicated to every city and town. The earth will be
filled with the knowledge of salvation."—Review, and Herald, Oct. 13, 1904.
                                      28
   6. What is said of those who have acted as God's messengers in
proclaiming the third angel's message? Rev. 14:12.

    NOTE.—"I was pointed down to the time when the third angel's message
was closing. The power of God had rested upon His people; they had ac-
complished their work, and were prepared for the trying hour before them.
They had received the latter rain, or refreshing from the presence of the
Lord, and the living testimony had been revived. The last great warning
had sounded everywhere, and it had stirred up and enraged the inhabitants
of the earth who would not receive the message."—Early Writings, page 279.
    "As the time comes for it [the message of the third angel] to be given
with greatest power, the Lord will work through humble instruments, leading
the minds of those who consecrate themselves to His service. The laborers
will be qualified rather by the unction of His Spirit than by the training of
literary institutions. Men of faith and prayer will be constrained to go forth
with holy zeal, declaring the words which God gives them."—The Great
Controversy, page 606.
              Seeking the Baptism of the Holy Spirit

  7. What should the church be doing in preparation for the out-
pouring of the Holy Spirit? Hosea 10:12.

    NOTE.—"We must pray that God will unseal the fountain of the water
of life. And we must ourselves receive of the living water. Let us, with con-
trite hearts, pray most earnestly that now, in the time of the latter rain, the
showers of grace may fall upon us. At every meeting we attend, our prayers
should ascend that at this very time, God will impart warmth and moisture
to our souls. As we seek God for the Holy Spirit, it will work in us meek-
ness, humbleness of mind, a conscious dependence upon God for the per-
fecting latter rain."—Review and Herald, March 2, 1897.
   8. How should we pray for the baptism of the Spirit? Mark
11:24; Gal. 3:14.

   NoTE.—"If we pray for the blessing in faith, we shall receive it as God has
promised." "Only those who are living up to the light they have, will re-
ceive greater light. Unless we are daily advancing in the exemplification of
the active Christian virtues, we shall not recognize the manifestations of the
Holy Spirit in the latter rain. It may be falling on hearts all around us, but
we shall not discern or receive it."—Review and Herald, March 2, 1897.
   9. How essential is it that we believe that we shall receive what
we ask for when we pray for the blessings God has promised?
James 1:6, 7.

   10. What assurances does the psalmist give that the one who
asks in faith shall not lack any good thing? Ps. 84:11; 34:9, 10.

  11. How willing is God to give the Holy Spirit to His children?
Luke 11:13.
                             [29]
   NOTE.—"He who truly seeks for the precious grace of Christ, will be sure
not to be disappointed. This promise has been given to us by Him who will
not deceive us. It is not stated as a maxim or a theory, but as a fact, as a
law of the divine government. We can be assured that we shall receive the
Holy Spirit if we individually try the experiment of testing God's word."—
Review and Herald, May 5, 1896.
    12. What special time of refreshing and rejoicing is to come
to the church in the last days? Joel 2:23; Acts 2:17; 3:19.

    NoTE.—"The great work of the gospel is not to close with less manifesta-
tion of the power of God than marked its opening. The prophecies which
were fulfilled in the outpouring of the former rain at the opening of the
gospel, are again to be fulfilled in the latter rain at its close."—The Great
Controversy, pages 611, 612.

                         Beware of False Spirits

   1. How are God's people warned against false spirits? 1 John
4:1.

    NOTE.—"Evil spirits, in the beginning created sinless, were equal in nature,
power, and glory with the holy beings that are now God's messengers. But
fallen through sin, they are leagued together for the dishonor of God and
the destruction of men. United with Satan in his rebellion, and with him
cast out from heaven, they have, through all succeeding ages, co-operated
with him in his warfare against the divine authority."—The Great Contro-
versy, page 513.
   2. What did Jesus say regarding the danger of deception? Matt.
24:4, 5.

   NoTE.—"No man can serve God without uniting against himself evil
men and evil angels. Evil spirits will be put upon the track of every soul
that seeks to join the ranks of Christ, for Satan wishes to recover the prey
taken from his grasp. Evil men will give themselves over to believe strong
                                     [ 30 ]
delusions, that they may be damned. These men will put on the garments of
sincerity and deceive, if possible, the very elect."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 595.
   3. To what extent is the deception to be carried? 2 Cor. 11:
13-15.

    NorE.—"The more we learn in reference to the early days of the Chris-
tian church, and see with what subtlety Satan worked to weaken and destroy,
the better we shall be prepared to resist his devices and meet coming perils.
We are in the time when tribulations such as the world has never yet seen
will prevail. . . . But God has set bounds that Satan cannot pass. Our most
holy faith is this barrier; and if we build ourselves up in the faith, we shall
be safe in the keeping of the Mighty One."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 297.

                             Prove the Spirits
   4. How reliable a sign of the Spirit's presence is a demonstra-
tion of great earnestness and fervor? 1 Kings 18:26-28. Compare
verses 36-38.

    NorE.—"God does not require His people to imitate Baal's prophets, to
afflict their bodies and cry out and shout, and throw themselves into almost
every attitude, having no regard for order, until their strength fails through
sheer exhaustion. Religion does not consist in making a noise; yet when the
soul is filled with the Spirit of the Lord, sweet, heartfelt praise to God
glorifies Him."—Testimonies, vol. 1, p. 231.
   5. What experience shows that we are not to depend upon
spectacular manifestations as evidence of the divine presence?
1 Kings 19:11-13.

   NOTE.—"The kingdom of God comes not with outward show. It comes
through the gentleness of the inspiration of His word, through the inward
working of His Spirit, the fellowship of the soul with Him who is its life.
The greatest manifestation of its power is seen in human nature brought to
the perfection of the character of Christ."—The Ministry of Heeling, page 36.
   6. To whom only is the Holy Spirit given? Acts 5:32.

    NorE.—"The Holy Spirit especially rested upon the apostles, who were
witnesses of our Lord's crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension,—important
truths which were to be the hope of Israel. All were to look to the Saviour
of the world as their only hope, and walk in the way which He had opened
by the sacrifice of His own life, and keep God's law and live."—Early Writ-
ings, page 197.

                        'Seeking Spiritual Gifts
   7. What spiritual gifts have been placed in the church? 1 Cor.
12:28-30.
                                      [ 31 ]
   8. What is to be the motive in seeking spiritual gifts? 1 Cor.
14:12. See Phil. 2:3.

  9. What was accomplished at Pentecost by the gift of tongues?
Acts 2:7-11.

   10. What, then, can be said of the genuineness of this or any
other gift of the Spirit? Matt. 7:20.

    NoTE.—"All the true followers of Christ bear fruit to His glory. Their
lives testify that a good work has been wrought in them by the Spirit of
God, and their fruit is unto holiness. Their lives are elevated and pure.
Right actions are the unmistakable fruit of true godliness, and those who
bear no fruit of this kind reveal that they have no experience in the things
of God."—Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, page 329.


                Masterly Deceptions of the Last Days

   11. What warning is given against spiritism? Isa. 8:19.

    NOTE.—"Satan leads men to consult those that have familiar spirits; and
by revealing hidden things of the past, he inspires confidence in his power
to foretell things to come. By experience gained through the long ages, he
can reason from cause to effect, and often forecast, with a degree of ac-
curacy, some of the future events of man's life. Thus he is enabled to de-
ceive poor, misguided souls, and bring them under his power, and lead them
captive at his will."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 687.
    "Through the agency of Spiritualism, miracles will be wrought, the sick
will be healed, and many undeniable wonders will be performed. And as the
spirits will profess faith in the Bible, and manifest respect for the institutions
of the church, their work will be accepted as a manifestation of divine power."
—The Great Controversy, page 588.

  12. What deceptions will be practiced by the archdeceiver?
Rev. 13:13, 14.

    NoTE.—"It was by the display of supernatural power, in making the
serpent his medium, that Satan caused the fall of Adam and Eve in Eden.
Before the close of time he will work still greater wonders. So far as his
power extends, he will perform actual miracles. . . . But there is a limit
beyond which Satan cannot go, and here he calls deception to his aid and
counterfeits the work which he has not power actually to perform. In the
last days he will appear in such a manner as to make men believe him to be
Christ come the second time into the world."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 698.
    "Satan is not permitted to counterfeit the manner of Christ's advent.
The Saviour has warned His people against deception upon this point, and
has clearly foretold the manner of His second coming."—The Great Contro-
versy, page 625.
                                     32
   13. How intense will be his efforts, and at whom will they be
especially directed? 2 Thess. 2:9-12; Matt. 24:24.

   NoTE.—"The only safety now is to search for the truth as revealed in
the word of God, as for hid treasure. The subjects of the Sabbath, the nature
of man, and the testimony of Jesus are the great and important truths to be
understood; these will prove as an anchor to hold God's people in these
perilous times."—Testimonies, vol. 1, p. 300.
   14. By what divine measuring line are all spirit manifestations
to be compared? Isa. 8:20.

   NOTE.—"What message do these teachers bring? Does it lead you to
reverence and fear God? Does it lead you to manifest your love for Him
by loyalty to His commandments? If men do not feel the weight of the
moral law; if they make light of God's precepts; if they break one of the
least of His commandments, and teach men so, they shall be of no esteem in
the sight of heaven. We may know that their claims are without foundation.
They are doing the very work that originated with the prince of darkness,
the enemy of God."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, page 208.



                   Lesson 12, for September 20, 1952

                        The Unpardonable Sin
   MEMORY VERSE: "For if we sin willfully after that we have received the
knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, but a certain fearful
looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries."
Heb. 10:26, 27.
   STUDY HELP: W. H. Branson, "The Holy Spirit," chapter 10.
                          DAILY STUDY ASSIGNMENT
1. General survey of the lesson; •      4. Read "The Holy Spirit," chapter 10.
     memorize Heb. 10:26, 27.           5. Questions 9-12.
2. Questions 1-5.                       6. Questions 13, 14.
3. Questions 6-8.                       7. Review the entire lesson.

                  Spirit Invites to Abiding Fellowship
  1. What experience is necessary in order to be free from sin
and condemnation? Rom. 8:9, first part.

   2. Without the indwelling Spirit, what is the condition? Rom.
8:9, last part.

   NOTE.—" 'If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His.'
He is alienated from God, fitted only for eternal separation from Him."—
Christ's Object Lessons, page 251.
                                           33 ]
    3. By whose invitation do we accept the call of God? Rev. 22:17.

    4. By whose leading do we become sons of God? Rom. 8:14.

    NOTE.—"Doing, not saying merely, is expected of the followers of Christ.
It is through action that character is built. 'As many as are led by the Spirit
of God, they are the sons of God.' Not those whose hearts are touched by
the Spirit, not those who now and then yield to its power, but they that are
led by the Spirit, are the sons of God."—Thoughts From the Mount of
Blessing, page 215.
   5. By whose ministry are both the Father and the Son brought
into abiding fellowship with the believers? John 14:17, 23.

   NorE.—To willfully reject the Holy Spirit, therefore, is to cut off all con-
nection with God, heaven, and salvation.
   "If we know God, and Jesus Christ whom He has sent, unspeakable
gladness will come to the soul. Oh, how we need the divine presence ! For the
baptism of the Holy Spirit every worker should be breathing out his prayer
to God."—Testimonies to Ministers, page 170.
              Warning Against Willful Disobedience

   6. For what reason only, therefore, are sinners lost? John 5:40.

    NorE.—"Christ saw in Jerusalem a symbol of the world hardened in un-
belief and rebellion, and hastening on to meet the retributive judgments of
God. The woes of a fallen race, pressing upon His soul, forced from His
lips that exceeding bitter cry. He saw the record of sin traced in human
misery, tears, and blood; His heart was moved with infinite pity for the af-
flicted and suffering ones of earth; He yearned to relieve them all. But even
His hand might not turn back the tide of human woe; few would seek their
only Source of help. He, was willing to pour out His soul unto death, to bring
salvation within their reach; but few would come to Him that they might
have life."—The Great Controversy, page 22.
  7. What is the result of continuing in a course of willful dis-
obedience? Heb. 10:26, 27.

   NOTE.—"God works by the manifestation of His Spirit to reprove and
convict the sinner; and if the Spirit's work is finally rejected, there is no
more that God can do for the soul. The last resource of divine mercy has
been employed. The transgressor has cut himself off from God; and sin has
no remedy to cure itself. There is no reserved power by which God can
work to convict and convert the sinner. 'Let him alone,' is the divine com-
mand. Then 'there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, but a certain fearful
looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the
adversaries.' "—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 405.
   8. What is said regarding the sin of Esau? Gen. 25:34; Heb.
12:16, 17.
                              [84 ]
   NorE.—"When he sought to buy it [the inheritance] back, even at a great
sacrifice on his part, he was not able to do so. He then bitterly repented his
rashness, his folly, his madness. He looked the matter over on every side.
He sought for repentance carefully and with tears, but it was all in vain. He
had despised the blessing, and the Lord removed it from him forever."—
Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 39.
                  Sinning Against the Holy Spirit
  9. What offense did Jesus say is unforgivable? Matt. 12:31;
Mark 3:29.

    NorE.—"What constitutes the sin against the Holy Ghost? It is willfully
attributing to Satan the work of the Holy Spirit. For example, suppose that
one is a witness of the special work of the Spirit of God. He has convincing
evidence that the work is in harmony with the Scriptures, and the Spirit
witnesses with his spirit that it is of God. Afterward, however, he falls
under temptation; pride, self-sufficiency, or some other evil trait, controls
him; and rejecting all the evidence of its divine character, he declares that
that which he had before acknowledged to be the power of the Holy Spirit
was the power of Satan. It is through the medium of His Spirit that God
works upon the human heart; and when men willfully reject the Spirit and
declare it to be from Satan, they cut off the channel by which God can com-
municate with them. By denying the evidence which God has been pleased
to give them, they shut out the light which had been shining in their hearts,
and as the result they are left in darkness."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 634.
   10. Under what circumstances did Jesus define the unpardon-
able sin? Matt. 12:22-30.

   11. How are we admonished against drifting into a state which
makes it impossible for the Holy Spirit to reach us? Heb. 3:12, 13;
1 Tim. 4:1.

    NOTE.—"Beware of procrastination. Do not put off the work of for-
saking your sins, and seeking purity of heart through Jesus. Here is where
thousands upon thousands have erred, to their eternal loss."—Steps to Christ,
page 37.
    "The book of life contains the names of all who have ever entered the
service of God. If any of these depart from Him, and by stubborn per-
sistence in sin become finally hardened against the influences of His Holy
Spirit, their names will in the judgment be blotted from the book of life,
and they themselves will be devoted to destruction."—Patriarchs and
Prophets, page 326.
    12. What blasphemy uttered by the scribes and Pharisees re-
garding Christ made them guilty of the unpardonable sin? Mark
3:30.
    NOTE.—"In rejecting Christ the Jewish people committed the unpardon-
able sin; and by refusing the invitation of mercy, we may commit the same
error."—The Desire of Ages, page 324 (1940 ed., pp. 324, 325).
   The unpardonable sin, therefore, is committed by a continual rejection
                                       35]
of truth, a repeated hardening of the heart against the wooing of the Spirit,
or procrastination in following Christ until the heart becomes so seared and
hardened that the Holy Spirit can no longer make any impression upon it.
Such a person has grieved away the Spirit, and has left himself without
God and without hope in the world.

              Complete Forgiveness for Confessed Sin

   13. What is the condition upon which God will forgive our
sins? 1 John 1:9.

   14. How complete is the provision for the forgiveness of sin?
Isa. 1:18; 38:17.



                 Lesson 13, for September 27, 1952

                       Receiving the Spirit
   MEMORY VERSE: "If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto
your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to
them that ask Him?" Luke 11:13.
   STUDY HELP: W. H. Branson, "The Holy Spirit," chapter 11.
                          DAILY STUDY ASSIGNMENT
1. General survey of the lesson;        4. Read "The Holy Spirit," chapter 11.
     memorize Luke 11:13.               5. Questions 8-10.
2. Questions 1-4.                       6. Questions 11-13.
3. Questions 5-7.                       7. Review the entire lesson.

           God's Willingness to Bestow the Holy Spirit

  1. When Jesus met with the disciples after the resurrection,
how did He remind them of His promise that the Comforter would
come? John 20:22.

    NorE.—"Not until after the ascension was the gift received in its fullness.
Not until through faith and prayer the disciples had surrendered themselves
fully for His working, was the outpouring of the Spirit received. Then in a
special sense the goods of heaven were committed to the followers of
Christ."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 327.
   2. In the message to the Laodiceans, what moving invitation is
given? Rev. 3:18-20.

    NorE.—"Every warning, reproof, and entreaty in the word of God or
through His messengers is a knock at the door of the heart. It is the voice
of Jesus asking for entrance."—The Desire of Ages, page 490 (1940 ed., pp.
489,490) .
   "He is not repulsed by scorn or turned aside by threatening, but con-
                                  [ 36 ]
tinually seeks the lost ones, saying, 'How shall I give thee up?' Although
His love is driven back by the stubborn heart, He returns to plead with
greater force, 'Behold, I stand at the door, and knock.'"—Christ's Object
Lessons, page 235.

   3. How does the Scripture teach the eagerness of God to bestow
the gift of the Holy Spirit? Luke 11:13.

    NOTE.—"The Father gave His Spirit without measure to His Son, and We
also may partake of its fullness."—The Great Controversy, page 477.
    "The Holy Spirit, the representative of Himself, is the greatest of all
gifts. All 'good things' are comprised in this. The Creator Himself can give
us nothing greater, nothing better. When we beseech the Lord to pity us
in our distress, and to guide us by His Holy Spirit, He will never turn away
our prayer."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, pages 189, 190.

   4. In what words does the prophet Isaiah assure us of the un-
failing, loving care of the heavenly Father? Isa. 49:15, 16.

   NOTE.—"Every soul is as fully known to Jesus as if he were the only one
for whom the Saviour died. The distress of every one touches His heart.
The cry for aid reaches His ear. He came to draw all men unto Himself.
He bids them, 'Follow Me,' and His Spirit moves upon their hearts to draw
them to come to Him."—The Desire of Ages, pages 479, 480 (1940 ed., p.
480).
                        Living Faith Essential
   5. Although saved by grace, what are we required to exercise
in order to possess the promised blessing? Eph. 2:8; Heb. 11:6.

  6. How is the promise of the Spirit made a reality in the life?
Gal. 3:14.

    NOTE.—"In the great and measureless gift of the Holy Spirit are con-
tained all of heaven's resources. It is not because of any restriction on the
part of God that the riches of His grace do not flow earthward to men. If
all were willing to receive, all would become filled with His Spirit. . . .
    "The indwelling of the Spirit will be shown by the outflowing of heavenly
love. The divine fullness will flow through the consecrated human agent, to
be given forth to others."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 419.

   7. What assurance is given the one who prays in faith for the
promised blessing? Mark 11:24.

                        Promise of God is Sure
  8. How may we know that whoever asks in faith for the Holy
Spirit will actually receive Him? Luke 11:9-13.
                                    t37]
   NOTE.—"Plead for the Holy Spirit. God stands back of every promise He
has made. With your Bible in your hands say, I have done as Thou hast
said. I present Thy promise, 'Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye
shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.'
   "We must not only pray in Christ's name, but by the inspiration of the
Holy Spirit. This explains what is meant when it is said that the Spirit
`maketh intercession for us, with groanings which cannot be uttered.' Such
prayer God delights to answer. When with earnestness and intensity we
breathe a prayer in the name of Christ, there is in that very intensity a
pledge from God that He is about to answer our prayer 'exceedingly abun-
dantly above all that we ask or think.' "—Christ's Object Lessons, page 147.
   9. What is the promise regarding the latter rain? Zech. 10:1.

    NOTE. "Near the close of earth's harvest, a special bestowal of spiritual
grace is promised to prepare the church for the coming of the Son of man.
This outpouring of the Spirit is likened to the falling of the latter rain; and
it is for this added power that Christians are to send their petitions to the
Lord of the harvest 'in the time of the latter rain.' "—The Acts of the Apos-
tles, page 55.
    "While we cherish the blessing of the early rain, we must not, on the
other hand, lose sight of the fact that without the latter rain, to fill out the
ears and ripen the grain, the harvest will not be ready for the sickle, and the
labor of the sower will have been in vain. . . . Do not rest satisfied that in
the ordinary course of the season, rain will fall. Ask for it. The growth and
perfection of the seed rests not with the husbandman. God alone can ripen
the harvest. But man's co-operation is required. God's work for us demands
the action of our mind, the exercise of our faith. We must seek His favors
with the whole heart if the showers of grace are to come to us."—Testimonies
to Ministers, pages 507, 508.
   10. Since the promises of God are sure, what is the explanation
of our lack of the Holy Spirit? James 1:6, 7.

   NoTE.—"After the prayer is made, if the answer is not realized immedi-
ately, do not weary of waiting and become unstable. Waver not. Cling to
the promise, 'Faithful is He that calleth you, who also will do it.' Like the
importunate widow, urge your case, being firm in your purpose."—Testi-
monies, vol. 2, p. 131.
                     "Lord, Increase Our Faith "
   11. On the last day of the feast, how did Jesus invite His hearers
to receive the Spirit? John 7:37-39.

    NOTE.—"If, with these promises before us, we choose to remain parched
and withered for want of the water of life, it is our own fault. If we
would come to Christ with the simplicity of a child coming to its earthly
parents, and ask for the things that He has promised, believing that we re-
ceive them, we should have them. . . . Now the question is: Will we come
to the fountain and drink? . . : God will do great things for us if we by
faith take Him at His word."—Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 179.
                                     138]
   12. In healing the demon-possessed child, what gracious as-
surance did Jesus give the father? Mark 9:23.

   13. In what prayer of the apostles should we earnestly join, in
order that our lack may be supplied? Luke 17:5.

       THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
        September 27, 1952—Central European Division
    The overflow of the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering at the close of the third
quarter will go to the Central European Division to be used in restoring the
conference office building and the church in the city of Frankfort, Germany,
both of which were destroyed by bombings during the war. Here is our
opportunity to show our poor people in Germany who have suffered so much
that we truly love them and want to do all we can to see their church homes
restored.
