                             Introductory Note
   "The apostle's words were written for the instruction of believers in every
age, and they have a special significance for those who live at the time when
the 'end of all things is at hand.' His exhortations and warnings, and his
words of faith and courage, are needed by every soul who would maintain
his faith 'steadfast unto the end.' "—The Acts of the Apostles, page 518.

                              Proper Attitudes
   1. In what terms does the apostle Peter exhort to unity? 1 Peter
3:8, first part.

    2. What prayer had Jesus made for His disciples? John 17:20-23.

   NOTE.—"Unity existing among the followers of Christ is an evidence that
the Father has sent His Son to save sinners. It is a witness to His power;
for nothing short of the miraculous power of God can bring human beings
with their different temperaments together in harmonious action, their one
aim being to speak the truth in love."—Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 194.
                                     [3]
   3. What consideration does Peter say should be given to others?
1 Peter 3:8, last part. See margin.

   NOTE.—"The world needs to see worked out before it the miracle that
binds the hearts of God's people together in Christian love. It needs to see
the Lord's people sitting together in heavenly places in Christ. Will you not
give in your lives an evidence of what the truth of God can do for those who
love and serve Him? God knows what you can be. He knows what divine
grace can do for you if you will be partakers of the divine nature."—Testi-
monies, vol. 9, p. 188.

  4. How does Paul set forth these Christian traits? Rotn. 12:10,
16,18.

                          Meeting Opposition
   5. How should the Christian relate himself to mistreatment?
1 Peter 3:9, first part.

    NOTE.—"Christianity will make a man a gentleman. Christ was courteous,
even to His persecutors; and His true followers will manifest the same
spirit. Look at Paul when brought before rulers. His speech before Agrippa
is an illustration of true courtesy as well as persuasive eloquence."—The
Ministry of Healing, page 489.

   6. Instead of retaliating, on whom should the Christian rely
for justice? Rom. 12:19-21.

  7. To what experiences is the Christian divinely called, and
why? 1 Peter 3:9, last part.

                       The Words and the Life
  8. How is the use of right speech related to a happy life now
and hereafter? 1 Peter 3:10. Compare Ps. 34:12, 13.

    NorE.—"The workman for God should make earnest efforts to become a
representative of Christ, discarding all uncomely gestures and uncouth
speech. He should endeavor to use correct language. There is a large class
who are careless in the way they speak, yet by careful, painstaking atten-
tion, these may become representatives of the truth. Every day they should
make advancement. They should not detract from their usefulness and in-
fluence by cherishing defects of manner, tone, or language. Common, cheap
expressions should be replaced by sound, pure words."—Counsels to Parents,
Teachers, and Students, page 238.

   9. How is the inner life revealed through our words? Luke
6:45. Compare James 3:2-6.
                                    [4]
    NoTE.—"The tenor of the conversation reveals the treasure of the heart.
The cheap common talk, the words of flattery, the foolish witticism, spoken
to create a laugh, are the merchandise of Satan, and all who indulge in this
talk are trading in his goods."—Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students,
page 340.
   10. What prayers of the psalmist would be fitting for us all?
Ps. 19:14; 141:3.

    NOTE.—"Evilspeaking is a twofold curse, falling more heavily upon the
speaker than upon the hearer. He who scatters the seeds of dissension and
strife reaps in his own soul the deadly fruits. . . . Grace and peace rest
upon those who refuse to join in the strife of tongues. When vendors of
scandal are passing from family to family, those who fear God will be chaste
keepers at home. . . . The sin of evilspeaking begins with the cherishing of
evil thoughts. Guile includes impurity in all its forms."—Testimonies, vol.
5, pp. 176, 177.

                      Turning From Evil to Good

   11. What should be our attitude toward evil and good? 1 Peter
3:11, first part; Ps. 37:27. Compare Acts 26:18.

    NOTE.—"What God wants is heart transformation, a putting away           , of
evil, a learning to do well. If that change takes place in the life, it will show
itself, not merely in a punctual observance of the mechanical aspects of
religion, but in relieving the oppressed and helping such as have no natural
protectors—the orphan and the widow."—M. L. Andreasen, Isaiah, the Gos-
pel Prophet, vol. 1, p. 19.
  12. What should we pursue? 1 Peter 3:11, last part; Rom. 12:18;
Heb. 12:14.

   NOTE.—"Every man's experience testifies to the truth of .thethe words of
Scripture, 'The wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest... . .
There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.' Isa. 57:20, 21. Sin has
destroyed our peace. While self is unsubdued, we can find no rest. The
masterful passions of the heart no human power can control. We are as
helpless here as were the disciples to quiet the raging storm. But He who
spoke peace to the billows of Galilee has spoken the word of peace for every
soul."—The Desire of Ages, page 336.

   13. What kind of peace is promised by the Saviour? John 14:27.

   NOTE.—"Whether on the land or on the sea, if we have the Saviour in
our hearts, there is no need of fear. Living faith in the. Redeemer will smooth
the sea of life, and will deliver us from danger in the way that He knows to
be best."—The Desire of Ages, page 336.

                       Lesson 2, for April 12, 1952

              The Christian Facing Persecution
     LESSON SCRIPTURE: 1 Peter 3:12-17.
     MEMORY VERSE: "But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready
always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in
you with meekness and fear." 1 Peter 3:15.
     STUDY HELPS: "Early Writings," pages 111-114; "The Great Controversy,"
pages 582-592.
     AIM: To strengthen our faith, that we may bear with courage the fiery trials that
lie ahead of us.
                        DAILY STUDY ASSIGNMENT
   1.   General survey of the lesson.        " 5. Questions 11-13.
   2.   Questions 1-4.                         6. Read "The Great Controversy"
   3.   Questions 5-8.                             assignment.
   4.   Questions 9, 10; read "Early Writ-     7. Review the lesson.
          ings" assignment.


                 The Source of Comfort and Strength
   1. Under whose constant watchcare is the Christian disciple?
1 Peter 3:12, first part.

   NorE.—"To have a consciousness that the eyes of the Lord are upon us
and His ears open to our prayers is a satisfaction indeed. To know that we
have a never-failing Friend in whom we can confide all the secrets of the
soul is a privilege which words can never express."—Testimonies,.vol.1, p. 502.
   2. In contrast, how does God regard the evildoer? 1 Peter 3:12,
second part.

   Nora.—"Neither wicked men nor devils can hinder the work of God, or
shut out His presence from His people, if they will, with subdued, contrite
hearts, confess and put away their sins, and in faith claim His promises.
Every temptation, every opposing influence, whether open or secret, may be
successfully resisted, 'not by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit, saith
the Lord of hosts.' "—The Great Controversy, page 529.
   3. What assuring question indicates God's watchcare in time
of persecution? 1 Peter 3:13.

   NOTE.—"Satan is well aware that the weakest soul who abides in Christ
is more than a match for the hosts of darkness, and that, should he reveal
himself openly, he would be met and resisted. Therefore he seeks to draw
away the soldiers of the cross from their strong fortification, while he lies in
ambush with his forces, ready to destroy all who venture upon his ground.
Only in humble reliance upon God, and obedience to all His commandments,
can we be secure."—The Great Controversy, page 530.
                                     (6 1
   4. What words of Jesus regarding persecution did Peter remem-
ber? 1 Peter 3:14, first part; Matt. 5:10-12.

   Norr.—"The precious Saviour will send help just when we need it. The
way to heaven is consecrated by His footprints. Every thorn that wounds
our feet has wounded His. Every cross that we are called to bear, He has
borne before us. The Lord permits conflicts, to prepare the soul for peace.
The time of trouble is a fearful ordeal for God's people; but it is the time
for every true believer to look up, and by faith he may see the bow of
promise encircling him."—The Great Controversy, page 633.
   5. What comfort and solace did the apostle Peter bring to the
persecuted Christians of his day? 1 Peter 3:14, last part; Ps. 91:1-11.

   Norn.—"When those early Christians were exiled to mountains and deserts,
when left in dungeons to die with hunger, cold, and torture, when martyrdom
seemed the only way out of their distress, they rejoiced that they were
counted worthy to suffer for Christ, who was crucified for them. Their
worthy example will be a comfort and encouragement to the people of God
who will be brought into the time of trouble such as never was."—Testi-
monies, vol. 5, p. 213.
            The Attitude of the Christian Under Trial
   6. Under the fiery trials of persecution what should be our
attitude toward God? 1 Peter 3:15, first part.

    Norn.—"When Christ reigns in the soul, there is purity, freedom from
sin. The glory, the fullness, the completeness of the gospel plan is fulfilled
in the life. The acceptance of the Saviour brings a glow of perfect peace,
perfect love, perfect assurance. The beauty and fragrance of the character
of Christ, revealed in the life, testifies that God has indeed sent His Son into
the world to be its Saviour."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 420.
   7. For what should we ever be prepared? 1 Peter 3:15, second
part.

   NOTE.—"As witnesses for Christ, we are to tell what we know, what we
ourselves have seen and heard and felt. If we have been following Jesus step
by step, we shall have something right to the point to tell concerning the
way in which He has led us. We can tell how we have tested His promise,
and found the promise true. We can bear witness to what we have known of
the grace of Christ. This is the witness for which our Lord calls, and for want
of which the world is perishing."—The Desire of Ages, page 340.
  8. In what attitude of mind will the true Christian bear wit,
ness? 1 Peter 3:15, third part.

   NorE.—The apostle Paul says that we "are saved by hope." (Rom. 8:24.)
In his letter to the Colossians he writes, "To whom God would make known
what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is
Christ in you, the hope of glory." Col. 1:27. The apostle Peter tells us that
                                       L73
in Christ we have been begotten into this "lively hope," or living hope,
which is reserved in heaven for us, "to be revealed in the last time." 1 Peter
1:3-5. When this living hope fills the Christian's heart, he will ever be
ready to give a reason for it to those who ask him.
   9. What is requisite for an effective witness? 1 Peter 3:16, first
part.

   10. If we represent the faith by a good life and a tender con-
science, what will be the effect upon our persecutors? 1 Peter 3:16,
second part.

  11. What was the admonition of the Saviour to His followers
under similar circumstances? Matt. 5:11, 16.

   12. What contrasting reasons for suffering are given, and which
is better? 1 Peter 3:17.

    NorE.—The literal translation of this text is as follows:
    "If God's will wills that you suffer while doing good, that is better than
to be doing evil (and suffer)."
    This is a general statement in harmony with 1 Peter 3:14: "If ye suffer
for righteousness' sake, happy are ye."
    Many persons are confounded to find that, though they are doing good,
they suffer. Yet one should recognize that that is exactly what God may will
under some circumstances. To do evil is reprehensible, and to suffer in the
doing of it is of no benefit. But to be doing the right thing and suffer perse-
cution on account of it, may be noble, and beneficial to the sufferer and the
onlooker. There is a parallelism between the sufferings of Christ and those
of the believer; and the patient endurance of the suffering has the twofold
value of a godly example for others, as well as a strengthening of the
believer's faith. One should never lose sight of the fact that one of the
blessings of persecution endured and triumphed over is that it may bring the
persecutor to Christ.
   13. What phrase indicates the divine control of individual suf-
fering? 1 Peter 3:17.

    NOTE.—"God's servants receive no honor or recognition from the world.
Stephen was stoned because he preached Christ and Him crucified. Paul was
imprisoned, beaten, stoned, and finally put to death, because he was a faith-
ful 'messenger of God .to the Gentiles. The apostle John was banished to the
Isle of Patmos, 'for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.'
These examples of human steadfastness in the might of divine power, are a
witness to the world of the faithfulness of God's promises, of His abiding
presence and sustaining grace. . . . God's heroes of faith are heirs to an
inheritance of greater value than any earthly riches,—an inheritance that
will satisfy the longings of the soul. By the world they may be unknown
and unacknowledged, but in the record books above they are enrolled as
citizens of heaven, and an exalted greatness, and eternal weight of glory, will
be theirs."—Gospel Workers, page 18.

                       Lesson 3, for April 19, 1952
              The Reward of Christ's Suffering
    LESSON SCRIPTURE: 1 Peter 3:18-22.
    MEMORY VERSE: "For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suf-
fered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow His steps." 1 Peter 2:21.
   STUDY HELPS: "Christ's Object Lessons," pages 390-404; "The Great Contro-
versy," pages 635-652.
    AIM: To strengthen our faith in the salvation of Christ through the power of His
resurrection, and to set our hope upon the reward that comes to those who suffer for
Him.
                         DAILY STUDY ASSIGNMENT
   1.   General survey of the lesson.        5. Questions 9-13.

          ject Lessons," assignment.

                    The Purpose of Christ's Suffering
   1. In what two ways was Christ's suffering different from ours?
1 Peter 3:18, first part.

    NOTE.—"His sufferings were vicarious. That is, He, the innocent One,
died in behalf of the guilty. Our sufferings are not vicarious but merely a
natural consequence upon our doing of the right. The words 'just' and `un-
just' are not preceded by the definite article in the Greek text, which is
indicative of the fact that the writer is emphasizing quality or nature. The
 idea is, 'a just Person in character in behalf of unjust persons in character.' "
    Secondly, "Peter says that our Lord died in order that He might bring
us to God. . . . The [Greek] word `bring' in the Greek text means literally
'to lead 10.' . . . Just so, our Lord Jesus by dying on the cross and paying
for our sins, satisfied the just penalty of the broken law which we incurred
by our disobedience, and removed for us that which barred our access to
 God."—Kenneth S. Wuest, First Peter in the Greek New Testament, page 93.
   2. In what terms does Peter speak of Christ's crucifixion and
resurrection? 1 Peter 3:18, last part.

   NOTE.—"The words, 'but quickened by the Spirit,' are set in contrast to
the words, 'having been put to death with respect to the flesh.' . . . That
human spirit during our Lord's earthly existence was energized by the Holy
Spirit, with the result that every prayer our Lord uttered, every word He
spoke, every miracle He performed, the sinless wonderful life He lived, was
in dependence upon, and in the energy of, the Holy Spirit, so that He was
able to offer Himself at the cross without spot to become the sacrifice that
God would accept as the atonement for sin (Heb. 9:14), 'who through the
eternal Spirit offered Himself without spot to God.' "—Kenneth S. Wuest,
First Peter in the Greek New Testament, pages 94-96.
    "Christ's humanity was united with divinity; He was fitted for the con-
                                     [9 ]
flict by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. And He came to make us par-
takers of the divine nature. So long as we are united to Him by faith, sin
has no more dominion over us. God reaches for the hand of faith in us to
direct it to lay fast hold upon the divinity of Christ, that we may attain to
perfection of character."—The Desire of Ages, page 123.

   3. In what words did David predict Jesus' life and resurrec-
tion? Ps. 16:8-10; Acts 2:25-28.

            The Ministry of Christ Through the Spirit
   4. To whom did Jesus, through the ministry of the Holy Spirit,
preach? 1 Peter 3:19.

    NOTE.—"This preaching was done, as to time, while the ark was prepar-
ing; as to place, on this earth, not in Hades; on the point by whom, by
Christ really, but through Noah instrumentally, whom Peter speaks of (2:5)
as a 'preacher of righteousness;' on the point to whom specifically, to those
hardened, defiant sinners, with whom God in long-suffering waited so long,
and of whom He at length said, 'My Spirit shall not always strive.' "—But-
ler, The Bible-Work, vol. 11, p. 660.
  5. What specific example does Peter give of the ministry of the
Spirit to those in prison? 1 Peter 3:20, first part.

   6. How many souls were saved by Noah's ministry? 1 Peter
3:20, last part.

    NoTE.—"The world's Redeemer had many hearers, but few followers.
Noah preached one hundred and twenty years to the people before the
Flood, and yet there were few who appreciated this precious, probationary
time. Save Noah and his family, not one was numbered with the believers
and entered into the ark. Of all the inhabitants of the earth, only eight souls
received the message; but that message condemned the world. The light
was given in order that they might believe; their rejection of the light
proved their ruin. Our message to the world will be a savor of life unto life
to all who accept it, and of condemnation to all who reject it."—Testimonies,
vol. 7, p. 36.
                       The Meaning of Baptism
  7. What other remarkable comparison does Peter make to

        "Testimonies," assignment.        7. Review the week's lesson.
   4. Questions 7-10.

             Patient Endurance Under Suffering
   1. What spiritual lessons •were these persecuted Christians to
learn from the suffering of Christ? 1 Peter 4:1, 2.
   NOTE.—"In [chapter] 3:18-22, Peter spoke of the sufferings of the Lord
Jesus, and of His example of patience and submissiveness under unjust treat-
ment. Now, he exhorts the saints to arm themselves with the same mind
that Christ had regarding unjust punishment."—Kenneth S. Wuest, First
Peter in the Greek New Testament, page 110.
    2. Before these Christians were converted, whose will were
they fulfilling? 1 Peter 4:3, first part. Compare Eph. 2:1-3.
                                    111]
   3. What description does Peter give of the will of the Gentiles?
1 Peter 4:3, last part.
   NorE.—"In an age when sensuality was wrought into all forms of litera-
ture and art, was blazoned shamelessly in the decorations of private houses
and enshrined in the temples of the gods, the contrast of a chaste and godly
conversation in the Christian community witnessed for the redemptive and
renovating power of the gospel. The exhortations of apostles at once testify
of this contrast and urge that it be made emphatic."—Butler, The Bible-
Work, vol. 11, p. 662.
   4. What misconception was held by these former associates of
the Christians to whom Peter was writing? 1 Peter 4:4.

    NOTE.—"The eternal God has drawn the line of distinction between the
saints and the sinners, the converted and the unconverted. The two classes
do not blend into each other imperceptibly, like the colors of the rainbow.
They are as distinct as midday and midnight."—Counsels to Parents, Teach-
ers, and Students, page 341.
   5. To whom must these Gentiles give an account for their
evilspeaking, and persecution of Christians? 1 Peter 4:5.

   6. What has been the purpose of the preaching of the gospel
in all ages? 1 Peter 4:6.
    NOTE.—"Notice, the text does not say that the gospel was preached to
them that were dead, but 'for this cause was the gospel preached also to
them that are dead.' It was preached to the antediluvians (2 Peter 2:5) ; it
was preached to Abraham (Gal. 3:8) ; it was preached to the unbelieving
Israelites (Heb. 4:2) ; it was preached through God's word and works to all
others (Psalm 19). But it was preached to all who are now dead or who
were dead at the time the above text was written, but when the dead were
alive. What utter futility it would be to preach to the dead 1 'His breath
goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.' "
—Milton C. Wilcox, Questions and Answers, No. 1, p. 51.
                        The New Life in Christ
   7. What is the effect of the preaching of the gospel in those who
respond to it? 1 Peter 4:6, last part.

   8. How fully will the judgment deal with the life record of
every individual? 2 Cor. 5:10.

   9. How does the apostle Peter stress the urgency of the call to
vigilance and alertness as we near the end? 1 Peter 4:7.

   Nora.—"We must never forget the warnings of Christ, 'Watch unto
prayer,"Watch, . . . and pray always.' A connection with the divine
                                [12]
agency every moment is essential to our progress. We may have had a
measure of the Spirit of God, but by prayer and faith we are continually to
seek more of the Spirit. It will never do to cease our efforts. If we do not
progress, if we do not place ourselves in an attitude to receive both the
former and the latter rain, we shall lose our souls, and the responsibility will
lie at our own door."—Testimonies to Ministers, page 508.
   10. What stirring appeal does the apostle again make in behalf
of brotherly love? 1 Peter 4:8.

    NoTE.—"Love's agencies have wonderful power, for they are divine. The
Soft answer that `turneth away wrath,' the love that `suffereth long, and is
kind,' the charity that `covereth a multitude of sins,'—would we learn the
lesson, with what power for healing would our lives be gifted! How life
would be transformed, and the earth become a very likeness and foretaste
of heaven !"—Education, page 114.
   11. What else are Christians exhorted to use? 1 Peter 4:9.

    NOTE.—"Much may be said about this ancient hospitality which pro,
vided lodging for a traveling Christian, gave him necessary information and
help to become located, to transact his business, to find work, to expedite
him on his journey. Some had to flee from their homes in other cities because
of persecution and were often destitute. During their many extensive travels
the apostles were guests at many Christian homes. Note Acts 16:15; Phile-
mon 22. . . . Even pagans remarked about how the Christians loved each
other and received a wholly strange Christian as a brother."—R. C. H. Len-
ski, Interpretation of the Epistles of St. Peter, St. John, and St. Jude, page
196.
   12. When we become Christians, of what are we made stew-
ards? 1 Peter 4:10, last part.
   NOTE.—" 'Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of the least of these My breth-
ren, ye did it un10. Me.' Hence we live under the responsibility of steward-
ship. And every man's gift is given to profit with all.: . . Nor can any of
us make it a profit to himself till he have found the way to make it profit-
able to his brethren."—The Expositor's Bible, on 1 Peter .4:10.
  13. What are we taught to do with the "manifold grace of
God"? 1 Peter 4:10, first part.

    NOTE.—"The close connection between gifts and [grace] is better marked
in: the Greek than it can be in the English. . . . Each hath received a gift.
None can plead his lack of faculty; none can claim exemption from the duty
of ministering; none is so poor but he has something that he lay out for the
brethren. All have time ; all have kind words: the least can give, what is the
best of gifts, a good example. But what we have is not our own; it is re-
ceived: and humility would teach us to believe that God has bestowed on
us the powers which we are- best fitted, , by place and opportunities, to use
in His service.. None can say of any gift, 'It is all my own; I may do with
it as I please.' God has set the world about us'full of His exchangers. The
poor, the feeble, the doubting, the fearful—these are God's bankers, with
                                      13
whom we may put out our gifts to usury. And Himself is the security for
all that we deposit."—The Expositor's Bible, on 1 Peter 4:10.
   14. What motive should prompt all Christian service? 1 Peter
4:11.
    NorE.—"Life's glorious meaning: 'That God in all things may be glori-
fied through Jesus Christ.' (Compare 1 Cor. 10:31; Phil. 1:11; 2:11.) . . .
This is the Christian's doxology. (a) He gives God the glory. (b) He ascribes
to God the power. (c) He testifies to the perpetuity of the grace and glory of
God in Christ. Thus by lip and life, in the present and in the future, the
Christian life is to be a doxology to God."—W. H. Griffith Thomas, The
Apostle Peter, page 226.



                         Lesson 5, for May 3, 1952
                Partakers of Christ's Suffering
   LESSON SCRIPTURE: 1 Peter 4:12-19.
   MEMORY VERSE: "Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of
God commit the keeping of their souls to Him in well-doing, as unto a faithful Creator."
1 Peter 4:19.
   STUDY HELPS: "The Acts of the Apostles," pages 509-513; "The Ministry of
Healing," pages 469-482.
   AIM: To teach that God permits nothing to come to us except that which He can

          the Apostles" assignment.

                      The Purpose of the Fiery Trial
  1. By what endearing term does Peter address the persecuted
Christians? 1 Peter 4:12, first part.

    NOTE.—"The word 'beloved' is in the Greek, 'beloved one.' The word is
the Greek word which speaks of God's divine and infinite love. . . . Peter
uses this word as a descriptive title, reminding the recipients of this letter
who were going through much suffering because of persecution, that they
were loved with all the love in the heart of God. What a sweet pillow upon
which to rest our weary hearts, just to know that our Father loves us. . . .
They are exhorted by Peter to think it a natural and expected thing that such
sufferings for righteousness' sake would come in view of the world's hatred
of Christ, and therefore to one who bears His name and reflects Him in his
life."—Kenneth S. Wuest, First Peter in the Greek New Testament, page 118.
   2. Against what wrong attitude toward fiery trials does Peter
caution the believers? 1 Peter 4:12.
                                         [ 14 ]
   3. How should the Christian not regard trials in this life?
1 Peter 4:12, second part.

    NOTE.—"Trials and obstacles are the Lord's chosen methods of discipline
and His appointed conditions of success. He who reads the hearts of men
knows their characters better than they themselves know them. He sees that
some have powers and susceptibilities which, rightly directed, might be used
in the advancement of His work. In His providence He brings these persons
into different positions and varied circumstances that they may discover in
their character the defects which have been concealed from their own knowl-
edge. He gives them opportunity to correct these defects, and to fit them-
selves for His service. Often He permits the fires of affliction to assail them
that they may be purified.
    "The fact that we are called upon to endure trial shows that the Lord
Jesus sees in us something precious, which He desires to develop."—The
Ministry of Healing, page 471.
   4. Why does Peter admonish them to rejoice under such trying
circumstances? 1 Peter 4:13, first part.

   5. When Christ's glory is revealed, what will be the experience
of these persecuted Christians? 1 Peter 4:13, last part.

            •    Bearing Reproach for Christ's Sake
   6. How should the Christian feel if he is reproached for Christ?
1 Peter 4:14, first part.

   7. What rests upon the followers of Jesus when they are re-
proached for His sake? 1 Peter 4:14, last part. Compare Matt.
5:11, 12.

  8. Against what causes of suffering does Peter warn these
Christians? 1 Peter 4:15.

    NoTE.—"Some of the recipients of this letter, before they were saved, had
suffered reproach as murderers, thieves, evildoers, and busybodies. Peter ad-
monishes them to let these sins be a thing of the past. What a life many of
these had been saved out of. The word 'busybody' means in the Greek, 'a
self-appointed overseer in other men's matters.'"—Kenneth S. Wuest, First
Peter in the Greek New Testament, page 121.

                     Glorifying God 'in Suffering
   9. Of what are we never to be ashamed? 1 Peter 4:16, first part.

   NOTE.—"We are not to let the future, with its hard problems, its unsatis-
fying prospects, make our hearts faint, our knees tremble, our hands hang
down. 'Let him take hold of My strength,' says the Mighty One, 'that he may
make peace with Me; and he shall make peace with Me,' Those who sur-
                                   f 163
render their lives to His guidahce and to His service will never be placed in
a position for which He has not made provision. Whatever our situation, if
we are doers of His word, we have a Guide to direct our way; whatever our
perplexity, we have a sure Counselor; whatever our sorrow, bereavement, or
loneliness, we have a sympathizing Friend."—The Ministry of Healing, pages
248, 249.
   10. Who is glorified when Christians suffer for righteousness'
sake? 1 Peter 4:16, last part.

                    Judgment-Hour Admonitions
   11. With whom, and when, will the judgment begin? 1 Peter
4:17, first part.

    NOTE.—"In the typical service, only those who had come before God with
confession and repentance, and whose sins, through the blood of the sin
offering, were transferred to the sanctuary, had a part in the service of the
Day of Atonement. So in the great day of final atonement and investiga-
five judgment, the only cases considered are those of the professed people of
God. The judgment of the wicked is a distinct and separate work, and takes
place at a later period."—The Great Controversy, page 480.
  12. What searching question does Peter ask concerning the
end of the wicked? 1 Peter 4:17, last part. Compare Mal. 4:1, 3.

    NOTE.—"What shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God?"
Peter leaves his readers to answer this important question. They cannot be
said to disobey a law they have not heard: the glad tidings have been preached
unto them, but have found no welcome. "They have had their days of
probation, and are like to Jerusalem at the time of the Lord's lamentation,
`If thou hadst known in this day the things which belong unto peace ! But
now they are hid from thine eyes.' (Luke 19:42.) . . . As of the doomed
city, so of them, it may be said, 'Ye would not.' "—The Expositor's Bible,
on 1 Peter 4 : 17.
   13. What contrast is made in the judgment between the end
of the righteous and that of the wicked? 1 Peter 4:18.

   14. What final exhortation is given those who suffer according
to the will of God? 1 Peter 4:19.

                The Qualifications of a True Leader
   1. What was the title of the most responsible church officers
in the early church? 1 Peter 5:1, first part.

   NoTE.—"The Greek word 'elder' was used as a designation of a man ad-
vanced in years. It became one of the official designations of an officer in a
local church who in other places is called an overseer or a bishop (Acts 20:17,
28; 1 Tim. 3:2), and whose duty it was to exercise spiritual oversight and
authority over its members."—Kenneth S. Wuest, First Peter in the Greek
New Testament, page 124.
   2. Where do we find the title of "elder" first used? Ex. 3:16, 18.

. 3. What are some qualifications of leaders of the church? 1 Tim.
3:1-9; Ex. 18:21.

 • 4. What does Peter say of himself that indicates that he had no
superiority over other officers in the church? 1 Peter 5:1, second
part.

   NOTE.—"The Greek for 'who am also an elder,' could also be rendered
`who am a fellow elder,' which is decisive against the primacy of Peter.
Peter neither claimed nor assumed any higher position than that of an
ordinary elder in the church."—Kenneth S. Wuest, First Peter in the Greek
New Testament, page 124.
                       The Work of the Ministry
   5. To what had Peter been called to bear witness, or testimony?
1 Peter 5:1, last part.
                                      E 17 ]
    NoTE.—"The organization of the church at Jerusalem was to serve as a
model for the organization of churches in every other place where messengers
of truth should win converts to the gospel. Those to whom was given the
responsibility of the general oversight of the church, were not to lord it over
God's heritage, but, as wise shepherds, were to 'feed the flock of God, . . .
being ensamples to the flock;' and the deacons were to be 'men of honest
report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom.' These men were to take their
position unitedly on the side of right, and to maintain it with firmness and
decision. Thus they would have a uniting influence upon the entire flock."
—The Acts of the Apostles, page 91.
   6. What is the elder of the church exhorted to do for his
flock? 1 Peter 5:2, first part. Compare Acts 20:28.

   7. What is said concerning the motives of one to be chosen as
an elder? 1 Peter 5:2, last part.

   NOTE.-" 'Not constrainedly but voluntarily,' not because they must but
because they want to; not like drafted soldiers but like volunteers; not
needing to be urged to every task but as running to put their hands to it,
delighted to do it. . . . Not a mere human eagerness but an eagerness 'in
accord with God' who by His Spirit has made the elders overseers of the
church of God (Acts 20:28)."—R. C. H. Lenski, Interpretation of the Epistles
of St. Peter, St. John, and St. Jude, pages 218, 219.
   8. What is said regarding genuine spiritual leadership in the
elder? 1 Peter 5:3; 1 Cor. 11:1.

    NorE.—"While he warns the elders against the assumption of lordship
over their charges, the apostle adds a precept which, if it be followed, will
abate all tendency to seek such lordship. For it brings to the minds of those
set over the flock that they too are but sheep, like the rest, and are appointed
not to dominate but to help their brethren. Making yourselves ensamples to
the flock. Christ's rule for the good shepherd is, 'He goeth before them, and the
sheep follow him' (John 10:4). The weak take in teaching rather from what
they see than from what they hear. The teacher must be a living witness
to the word, a proof of its truth and power. If he be not this, all his teach-
ing is of little value. The simplest teacher who lives out his lessons in his
life becomes a mighty power; he gains the true, the lawful lordship, and—
                 `Truth from his lips prevails with double sway.'"
                                      —The Expositor's Bible, on 1 Peter 5:3.

                       The Reward of Humility
   9. When and what will be the reward of the true undershep-
herd? 1 Peter 5:4; John 10:28.

   NoTE.—"With unutterable love, Jesus welcomes His faithful ones to the
`joy of their Lord' The Saviour's joy is in seeing, in the kingdom of glory,
the souls that have been saved by His agony and humiliation. And the re-
deemed will be sharers in His joy, as they behold, among the blessed, those
                                      [ 18 ]
who have been won to Christ through their prayers, their labors, and their
loving sacrifice. As they gather about the great white throne, gladness un-
speakable will fill their hearts, when they behold those whom they have won
for Christ."—The Great Controversy, page 647.
  10. What ethical relationship should exist between the younger
members of the church and the elders? 1 Peter 5:5, first part.

   11. What is said regarding the relationship of all church mem-
bers? 1 Peter 5:5, second part; Phil. 2:1-5; John 17:17-21.
   12. How does God differ in His attitude toward the proud and
toward the humble? 1 Peter 5:5, last part; Prov. 8:13; 16:18;
1 John 2:16.

    NOTE.—"He who feels whole, who thinks that he is reasonably good, and
is contented with his condition, does not seek to become a partaker of the
grace and righteousness of Christ. Pride feels no need, and so it, closes the
heart against Christ and the infinite blessings He came to give. There is no
room for Jesus in the heart of such a person."—Thoughts From the Mount
of Blessing, page 19.
  13. What is the true road to ultimate exaltation? 1 Peter 5:6;
Phil. 2:8-16.

   14. What should Christians do with cares and burdens? 1 Pe-
ter 5:7. Compare Phil. 4:6, 7; Isa. 26:3.

   5. Questions 11-13.
                            A Common Enemy
    1. What counsel did Peter send to the persecuted Christians?
1 Peter 5:8, first part.
                                      [ 191
   2. Why is it necessary for the Asian Christians to be sobei and
vigilant? 1 Peter 5:8, second part.

    NoTE.—"From the days of Adam to our own time, our great enemy has
been exercising his power to oppress and destroy. He is now preparing for
his last campaign against the church. All who seek to follow Jesus will.be
brought into conflict with this relentless foe. The more nearly the Christian
imitates the divine Pattern, the more surely will he make himself, a. mark for
the attacks of Satan. All who are actively engaged in the cause of God, seek-
ing to unveil the deceptions of the evil one and to present Christ 'before the
people, will be able to join in the testimony of Paul, in which he speaks of
serving the Lord with all humility of mind, with many tears and temptations."
—The Great Controversy, page 510.
   3. What is the sinister purpose of the "walking about" of the
roaring lion? 1 Peter 5:8, last part.

    NorE.—The word roaring in the Greek text speaks of the howil of a beait
in fierce hunger. "The suggestion is that of drinking the victim's blood. Did
Peter think of martyrs in the arena, who were driven out from the dungeons
to face actual lions? He must have thought at least of bloody death.".—R.
C. H. Lenski, Interpretation of the Epistles of St. Peter, St. John, and St.
Jude, page 226.
   4. What courageous attitude is urged by the apostle in por-
traying the militant conflict? 1 Peter 5:9, first part. Compare
Matt. 10:28-33.

   NOTE.—"The words 'in the faith' refer to the believer's own faith; .
that is, the Christian is to stand firm against the onset of the devil, not in
himself, but in the exercise of a faith that depends upon the strengthening
and protecting power of God."—Kenneth S. Wuest, First Peter in the Greek
New Testament, page 130.
  5. Name the implements of spiritual warfare as outlined by
Paul. Eph. 6:10-18.

   6. As an urge to steadfastness, of what did Peter remind his
readers? 1 Peter 5:9, last part.

    NOTE.—"Just as it is a power in warfare when men see their leader before
them, facing the same perils, hear his voice cheering them, by his courage,
inspiring them with his hope; just as it is a support to brave men to find
brave brethren at their side in the conflict, animated by, the same spirit,
marching forward to the same victory, so is it in the Christian struggle. All
Christians are to be steadfast, the elders like the leaders of -an army,- the
younger like the soldiers who follow, . . . moving with one spirit against
the foe, feeling that each is like-minded with all the rest, while all are equally
conscious of the importance of victory, they may grasp hands as they go .for-
ward, and be heartened thereby, being sure that in the danger they will have
helpers at their side."—The Expositor's Bible, on 1 Peter 5:9.
                                      [ 20 ]
                            Called Unto Glory
   7. As an incentive to remain firm and unmoved by trial and
persecution, of what .gracious call does the apostle remind them?
1 Peter 5:10, first part. Compare Rom. 8:18.

   NoTE.—"You must, indeed, look to Jesus, keeping your eyes fixed on the
glory at the top of the ladder. Through Christ alone can you make sure of
heaven, where all is purity, holiness, peace, and blessedness, where there are
glories that mortal lips cannot describe.'The nearest we can come to a descrip-
tion of thd reward that awaits the overcomer is to say that it is a far more
exceeding and eternal weight of glory. It will be an eternity of bliss, a blessed
eternity, unfolding new glories throughout the ceaseless ages. . . . I want
you . . . to be among the redeemed, to act a part in the coronation of
Christ."—Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 131.
   8. What is the fourfold purpose of God in permitting His fol-
lowers to suffer? 1 Peter 5:10, last part.

    NOTE.—"The trials of life are God's workmen, to remove the impurities
and roughness from our character. Their hewing, squaring, and chiseling,
their burnishing and polishing, is a painful process; it is hard to be pressed
down to the grinding wheel. But the stone is brought forth prepared to fill
its place in the heavenly temple. Upon no useless material- does the Master
bestow such careful, thorough work. Only His precious stones are polished
after the similitude of a palace."--Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing,
Pages 23, 24.
   9. Through what experience did Jesus learn obedience? Heb.
5:7-9; 12:1-4.

  10. With what brief but fitting doxology does Peter close his
exhortation? 1 Peter 5:11.

                         The Close of the Epistle
   11. • By whOin did Peter send this letter to the believers in Asia?
1 Peter 5:12.

   12. Where was Peter, and who was with him, when he wrote
this letter to the believers in Asia? 1 Peter 5:13.

   NOTE.—"In the providence of 'God, Peter was permitted to close his
ministry in Rome, where his imprisonment was ordered by the emperor
Nero about the time of -Paul's final arrest. Thus the two veteran apostles,
who for many years had been widely separated in their labors, were to bear
their last witness for Christ in the world's metropolis, and upon its soil to
shed their blood -as the seed of a vast harvest of saints and martyrs."—The
Acts of the Apostles, page 537.
                                     E 21 ]
   13. With what words of charm and tender affection does the
great apostle close this timely epistle? 1 Peter 5:14.

    NoTE.—"Peace be unto you all that are in Christ. This is the bond which
unites believers into one fellowship. To be in Christ is to be of the brother-
hood which has been so significantly marked just before for its unity. . . .
Individuals are brought by it into close communion, as Peter himself with
Silas and with Mark, whom he speaks of in terms of family love. . . . Well
might the heathen, wonder-struck, exclaim, 'See how these Christians love
one another!' And the apostle's own words mark the all-embracing character
of the love: all that are in Christ. They are all brethren, children of the
common Father, inheritors of the same promises, pilgrims on the same jour-
ney, sustained by the same hope, servants of the same Lord, and strengthened,
guided, and enlightened by the one Spirit, who is promised to abide with
Christ's church forever."—The Expositor's Bible, on 1 Peter 5:14.



                       Lesson 8, for May 24, 1952

            Diligence in Spiritual Development
   LESSON SCRIPTURE: 2 Peter 1:1-11.
   MEMORY VERSE: "Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious
promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the
corruption that is in the world through lust." 2 Peter 1:4.
   STUDY HELPS: "The Acts of the Apostles," pages 529-538; "Christ's Object

                     The Saving Knowledge of God
    1. To whom did Peter address his second epistle? 2 Peter 1:1,
first part.
    NoTE.—As a servant, or rather bondservant, of Jesus Christ, Peter stands
on the same level with those to whom he writes. Jesus had said to the
Twelve, and through them to the whole body of believers, "One is your Mas-
ter, even Christ. But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant."
Matt. 23:10, 11. The servants of Christ are, for His sake, servants to all the
brotherhood. 2 Cor. 4:5. As an apostle, he speaks with authority. The sol-
emn character of the office is stamped by Christ's own words, "As My Fa-
ther hath sent Me, even so send I you;" and the churches are reminded, as
they think of the apostolic office, that the Lord who commissioned the
Twelve to be His servants said, "He that heareth you heareth Me; and he
that despiseth you despiseth Me."
                                        [ 22 ]
   2. How is this "precious faith" obtained? 2 Peter 1:1, last part.

   3. What knowledge is most essential to every Christian? What
blessing will follow the acquiring of this knowledge? 2 Peter 1:2;
John 17:3.

   4. What has God through His divine power provided for all
who accept His gracious offer? To what triumphant experience
are we called? 2 Peter 1:3.

    NoTE.—"The Divine Provision. vv. 3, 4. 1. Its character: v. 3, 'Life and
godliness.' Note these two elements of Christian experience. The possession
of 'life' and its expression in 'reverence.' 2. Its spirit: vv. 3, 4, 'Granted unto
us.' Notice the emphasis in this representation of the thought of God's free
and full gift. Not human merit, but divine love characterizes this provision.
3. Its extent: v. 3, 'All things.' Everything for the commencement, continu-
ance, and completion of the Christian life is thus provided. The certainty
and encouragement of this assurance is evident. 4. Its guarantee: v. 3, 'His
divine power.' This is the adequate and permanent assurance to the believer
of the provision for his life. 5. Its secret: v. 3, 'Through the knowledge of
Him that hath called us by His own glory and virtue.' This divine prOvision
only becomes available in union and communion with God."—W. H. Griffith
Thomas, The Apostle Peter, pages 249, 250.
   5. If we accept the great and precious promises of God, what
will they do for us? 2 Peter 1:4; John 10:28; 12:50.

  6. Upon whose divine power does the Christian's hope of an
abundant entrance to the kingdom of God depend? Gal. 2:20.

                     The Earnest Call to Diligence
   7. Through what seven steps in Christian growth will the
diligent believer be led? 2 Peter 1:5-7.

   NoTE.—"We are saved by climbing round after round of the ladder,
looking to Christ, clinging to Christ, mounting step by step to the height of
Christ, so that He is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctifica-
tion and redemption. Faith, virtue,. knowledge, temperance, patience, god-
liness, brotherly kindness, and charity are the rounds of this ladder. All these
graces are to be manifested in the Christian character; and 'if ye do these
things, ye shall never fall: for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you
abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
Christ.'"—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 147.
  8. What ninefold fruit of the spirit will be seen in the life of
one who is diligently pursuing the Christian life? Gal. 5:22, 23.

    NOTE.—"Spiritual fertility:— . . . First of all, here is the relation of the
                                  [23]
soul with God Himself: Love is that which unites us with God; joy, which
means the thanksgiving and the consciousness of God's infinite goodness, in
which we live and move; peace, whereby we are at rest with God, and in
ourselves, and with all mankind. Then there are the fruits which have rela7
tion to our neighbor; and the first is patience. Do we bear with our neigh-
bors? Are we irritable, revengeful, resentful, malicious? If so, the fruits of
the Holy Ghost are not in us. . . . Long-suffering is another name for
patience. Just as equity is the most delicate form of justice, long-suffering is
the most perfect form of charity, the perpetual radiance of a loving heart,
which, in its dealings with all around, looks kindly upon them and judges
kindly of their faults. . . . Gentleness means kindness and forbearance, the
dissembling of wrong, the absence of the fire of resentment and of the
smoldering of ill will. Next comes goodness; as a fountain pours out pure
water, so the good heart is perpetually pouring out goodness and diffusing
goodness on all around. Faith means veracity, so that a man's word is as
good as an oath. And then, lastly, there are certain fruits which have rela-
tion to ourselves. They are, first, modesty, . . which is both within and
without—modesty of bearing, modesty of conduct, of dress, of demeanor, a
chastened and sensitive regard for others, in all that is due from us to them,
which keeps us from obtrusiveness, and from transgressing the delicate con-
sideration which is their right. Temperance or continence means most espe=
cially the repressing of passions—the passion of anger, the inclination to
pleastire, to honor, to wealth; it is the transparent purity of the soul, and
the custody of the senses, because they are the avenues to the soul by which
sin enters. Such, then, are the fruits of the Holy Spirit."—The. Biblical Il-
lustrator, Galatians, page 387.
   9. What are the blessed results of exercising diligence in adding
these Christian virtues? 2 Peter 1:8; John 15:8.

     NOTE.—"Permanence of character: 'If these things are yours.' . . .
Depth of character: 'And abound.' Reality of character: 'They make you to
be not, idle nor unfruitful unto the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.'
. . . Whatever permanence, depth, and reality become ours as the result of
diligence, the outcome will be an increasing experience of our Master, and
an ever-deepening fellowship with Him."—W. H. Griffith Thomas, The Apos-
tle Peter, pages 254, 255.
   10. How does Peter express the sad experience of those who
lack these virtues? 2 Peter 1:9.

     NoTE.—"Lack of spiritual perception: 'Is blind, seeing only what is near.'
Nearsighted Christians are a sad and sorry fact in the Christian church. This
weakness of spiritual sight, insight, and foresight is always due to unfaith=
fulness in Christian living. . . . Loss of spiritual privilege: 'Forgotten • the
cleansing from his old sins.' The awful possibility here indicated is almost
too terrible to contemplate. To think that a man should actually forget the
moment and early experiences of his conversion and joy of salvation. Yet
all this is clearly regarded as possible, and as resulting from unwillingness to
`add diligently after the reception of God's gifts.' "—W. H. Griffith Thomas,
The Apostle Peter, pages 255, 256.
   11. Having specified the danger of losing our spiritual eyesight,
                              [ 24]
how does Peter renew his exhortation to diligence? 2 Peter 1:10,
first part.

   12. How does Peter stress the assurance of victory to those who
diligently take these progressive steps in Christian growth? 2 Pe-
ter 1:10, last part.

   NoTE.--God promises to multiply to us grace and peace if we will dili-
gently practice adding to our experience these charming attributes of Chris-
tian character. And if we are faithful on our part, He will be responsible to
see that "ye shall never fall."
   13. In what thrilling words does Peter further describe the
permanency of the rich reward of diligence? 2 Peter 1:11.



                     Lesson 9, for May 31, 1952

                The Certainty of Our Faith
   LESSON SCRIPTURE: 2 Peter 1:12-21.
   MEMORY VERSE: "For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when
we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were
eyewitnesses of His majesty." 2 Peter 1:16.
   STUDY HELPS: "Education," pages 301-309; "The Great Controversy," pages
593-602; "Christ's Object Lessons," pages 62-69.
   AIM: To establish our faith in the certainties of God's prophetic word.
                         DAILY STUDY ASSIGNMENT
   1. General survey of the lesson.       5. Questions 10-13.
   2. Questions 1-4.                      6. Read selections from "Christ's Ob-

   4. Questions 7-9; read "The Great Con-
        troversy," assignment.

                      Pastoral Solicitude
   1. What marks of a true undershepherd may we find manifest
in Peter's method of ministry? 2 Peter 1:12.

    NorE.—"It is the privilege of the watchmen on the walls of Zion to live
so near to God, and to be so susceptible to the impressions of His Spirit, that
He can work through them to tell sinners of their peril, and point them to
the place of safety. Chosen of God, sealed with the blood of consecration,
they are to rescue men and women from impending destruction. Faithfully
are they to warn their fellow men of the sure result of transgression, and
faithfully are they to safeguard the interests of the church. At no time may
they relax their vigilance. Theirs is a work requiring the exercise of every
faculty of the being."—Gospel Workers, page 15.
                                     126 ]
  2. What deep conviction possessed the heart of Peter as he
wrote this epistle? 2 Peter 1:13.

   3. Of what was Peter aware regarding the close of his ministry?
2 Peter 1:14. Compare John 21:18, 19.

    NoTE.—This is the clue as to the time when Peter wrote this epistle. He
was martyred by Nero about A.D. 64. It is reasonable to believe that the per-
secutions had already broken out in Rome, and Peter knew that it would be
only a short time before it would extend throughout the provinces of the
empire; therefore he wrote these inspired counsels to prepare all Christians
for like conditions and to teach us how to carry on when we face like situa-
tions.
   4. What was Peter's concern for the believers after his death?
2 Peter 1:15. Compare John 14:26.

   NOTE.—"He will soon be removed. To this he looks forward without
alarm. His concern is for them, not for himself. . . . He must have had
constantly in mind the Master's prophecy, 'When thou shalt be old, thou
shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee
whither thou wouldest not (John 21:18).' . . . His letters are the only
means whereby he can speak after he has been taken from them. . . . When
dead, he will yet speak to them; so that in each new trial, in each time of
need, they may strengthen their faith or be warned of their danger. 'At
every time,' he says; and thus his strengthening words of admonition are a
legacy through the ages to the church for evermore."—The Expositor's Bi-
ble, on 2 Peter 1:15.
                          Personal Testimony
  5. What assurance concerning the power and coming of our
Lord in glory did the apostle give us? 2 Peter 1:16, first part.

   6. What memorable experience in his association with Jesus
had made Peter so confident? 2 Peter 1:16 (first part), 17; Luke
9:32-35.

    NorE.—"Moses upon the mount of transfiguration was a witness to
Christ's victory over sin and death. He represented those who shall come
forth from the grave at the resurrection of the just. 'Elijah, who had been
translated to heaven without seeing death, represented those who will be
living upon the earth at Christ's second coming, and who will be 'changed,
in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump.' . . . Jesus was
clothed with the light of heaven, as He will appear when He shall come 'the
second time without sin unto salvation.' . . . The Saviour's promise to the
disciples was now fulfilled. Upon the mount the future kingdom of glory was
represented in miniature,—Christ the King, Moses a representative of the
risen saints, and Elijah of the translated ones."—The Desire of Ages, pages
421, 422.
                                      [ 26 ]
                 Not Myths, but Divine Revelation
• 7. To what did Peter refer as being even more sure than the
witness of the senses? 2 Peter 1:19, first part.

   8. What admonition is given to us concerning the sure word
of prophecy? 2 Peter 1:19, second part. Compare Ps. 119:9, 11, 105.

    NoTE.—"Holy Scripture speaks from heaven, telling the whence and the
whither. All past and all future are an open book to the living God. We look
to Him to tell us the meaning of events of our own day, and to show us what
is to be the issue of conditions that baffle the wisest of earth. There is light
for this dark time. It is the same light that guided apostolic disciples in
times that saw great changes in the ancient Roman world. Really, it seems
that the apostle Peter spoke more for our time than for his own."—Wm. A.
Spicer, What Next? page 9.
   9. How long will the lamp of prophecy illumine the life of the
believers? 2 Peter 1:19, last part.

    NoTE.—"As we near the close of this world's history, the prophecies re-
lating to the last days especially demand our study. The last book of the
New Testament Scriptures is full of truth that we need to understand. Satan
has blinded the minds of many, so that they have been glad of any excuse
for not making the Revelation their study. But Christ through His servant
John has here declared what shall be in the last days, and He says, 'Blessed
is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep
those things which are written therein.' "—Christ's Object Lessons, page 133.
  10. What warning did Peter give his readers concerning the
misuse of prophecy? 2 Peter 1:20. Compare 1 Cor. 2:9-14.

   NOTE.—"While exalting the 'sure word of prophecy' as a safe guide in
times of peril, the apostle solemnly warned the church against the torch of
false prophecy, which would be uplifted by 'false teachers,' who would
privily bring in 'damnable heresies, even denying the' Lord.' These false
teachers, arising in the church and accounted true by many of their breth-
ren in the faith, the apostle compared to 'wells without water, clouds that
are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for-
ever.' The latter end is worse with them,' he declared. 'than the beginning.
For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteous-
ness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment
delivered unto them.' "—The Acts of the Apostles, page 535.
   11. What guiding principles are given in the Scriptures regard-
ing the importance of prophecy, and what shoule be our relation
to it? Isa. 28:10; 8:20; 2 Chron. 20:20; Prov. 29:18.

   Nora.—"It is the voice of Christ that speaks through patriarchs and
prophets, from the days of Adam even to the closing scenes of time. The
                                 [ 27 ]
Saviour is revealed in the Old Testament as clearly as in the New. It is the,
light from the prophetic past that brings out the life of Christ and the
teachings of the New Testament with clearness and beauty. The miracles,
of Christ are a proof of His divinity; but a stronger proof that He is the
world's Redeemer is found in comparing the prophecies of the Old Testament
with the history of the New."—The Desire of Ages, page 799.
   12. What is said about the initiative of man in giving the words
of prophecy? 2 Peter 1:21, first part.

   13. Who guided men of old when they were called to be .chan-
nels for God's revelations? 2 Peter 1:21, last part.
    NoTE.—"God has been pleased to communicate His truth to the world
by human agencies, and He Himself, by His Holy Spirit, qualified men and
enabled them to do this work. He guided the mind in the selection of what
to speak and what to write. . . .
    "The treasure was entrusted to earthen vessels, yet it is, nonetheless, from
Heaven. The testimony is conveyed through the imperfect expression of
human language, yet it is the testimony of God; and the obedient, believing
child of God beholds in it the glory of a divine power, full of grace and
truth."—The Great. Controversy, Introduction, pages 6, 7.

                               Timely Warnings•
  1. What prediction did Peter make regarding the perils the
church would face? 2 Peter 2:1. Compare ActS 20:28-31.
  2. How successful will these false teachers be in their efforts to
oppose the truth? 2 Peter 2:2; 2 Thess. 2:11, 12.
   NoTE.—"It is the first and highest duty of every rational being to learn
from ,the Scriptures what is truth, and then to walk in the light, and en-
courage others to follow his example."—The Great Controversy, page 598.
                                         [ 28 1
    3. What is the real motive of the false teachers? 2 Peter 2:3,
first part.
   NOTE.—"Covetousness was their besetting sin, the sphere in which they
lived. St. Paul warned Titus against false teachers who taught 'things which
they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake' (Titus 1:11; see also 1 Tim. 6:6 and
Jude 16). . . . The like sin seems to have been characteristic of the false
teachers of apostolic times. The word translated 'feigned' . . . occurs no-
where else in the New Testament; the words of these men were not the
expression of their real thoughts and feelings; they were invented, craftily
contrived to deceive men, and that for the sake of money. . . . The false
teachers will work hard, as the Pharisees did, to make proselytes; but their
real motive is, not the salvation of, souls, but their own selfish gain."—The
Pulpit Commentary, on 2 Peter 2:3.
  4. With what certainty does Peter express the penalty of these
covetous false teachers? 2 Peter 2:3, last part. Compare Eph. 5:5, 6.
    NOTE.—"The sentence of judgment is for them, for their condemnation;
in the foreknowledge of God it has been pronounced long ago, and ever
since it has been drawing near; it doth not tarry. (Compare Jude 4 and
1 Peter 4:17.)"—The Pulpit Commentary, on 2 Peter 2:3.
  5. What example of divine punishment is set forth in this
warning? 2 Peter 2:4.

                    Deliverance of the Righteous
   6. What indicates that God will protect and save all who are
faithful to Him? 2 Peter 2:5; Ps. 32:8.
  7. What ancient cities did God overthrow as a warning to all
who live ungodly? 2 Peter 2:6.

   8. In this destruction, how did God again reveal Himself as
the Deliverer of the true and faithful? 2 Peter 2:7.

   9. How was Lot affected, and how will God's elect today be
affected by the surrounding wickedness? 2 Peter 2:7, 8; Ezek. 9:4.
   10. How does the Lord give assurance of His constant watch-
care over the godly? 2 Peter 2:9, first part; Job 5:19; 1 Cor. 10:13;
2 Tim. 4:18.

                      Punishment of the Wicked
   11. When will the unjust receive their final punishment? 2 Pe-
ter 2:9, last part; Jude 14, 15; Rev. 20:12.
                                     [ 29 ]
   12. What class of sinners are specified as being especially de-
serving of punishment in that judgment? 2 Peter 2:10, first part;
Jude 18, 19.

     NOTE.-"But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of defile-
ment, and despise dominion. These chiefly-that is, above other sinners.
. . . It cannot be otherwise, for on them His chastisements have little effect.
They have entered on a road from which return is rare, neither do they take
hold on the paths of life; their whole bent is for that which defileth, not only
defiling them, but spreading defilement on every side. They are renegades,
too, from the service of Christ; and having cast off their allegiance to Him,
they make their lust their law. The verse describes the same character in two
aspects: those who walk after the flesh follow no prompting but appetite,
have no lord but self."-The Expositor's Bible, on 2 Peter 2:10.
   13. What two strong words are employed to describe these cor-
rupt sinners? 2 Peter 2:10, last part. Compare 1 Cor. 10:8-12.

   14. With what beautiful contrasting example of self-control
and restraint does Peter close this warning against false teachers?
2 Peter 2:11. Compare Jude 9.

    NoTE.-From the above warnings we may learn the following: The unerr-
ing judgment of sin: 1. Swiftly (v. 1) ; 2. sure (v. 3) ; 3. complete (v. 9).
The urgent need of watchfulness: 1. Because error counterfeits good; 2. be-
cause evil lures the good; 3. because of the intimate connection between error
in teaching and evil in practice. The glorious certainties of the gospel teach-
ing: 1. A divine Redeemer (v. 1) ; 2. a way of truth (v. 2); 3. a sure pro-
tection (v. 9).


                      Lesson 11, for June 14, 1952

               The Tragic Result of Apostasy
    LESSON SCRIPTURE: 2 Peter 2:12-22.
    MEMORY VERSE: "For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world
through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled
therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning." 2 Peter
2:20.
    STUDY HELPS: The book of Jude; "Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing,"
pages 119-150.
    AIM: To set before Christians the enormity of the sin of forsaking Christ and
turning again to the former life of sin.
                         DAILY STUDY ASSIGNMENT
   1. General survey of the lesson.          5. Questions 10-13.

                    Character of False Teachers
  1. As Peter continues to describe the false teachers, with what
does he compare them? 2 Peter 2:12.

    NOTE.—"Choose poverty, reproach, separation from friends, or any suf-
fering rather than to defile the soul with sin. Death before dishonor or the
transgression of God's law should be the motto of every Christian. As a
people professing to be reformers, treasuring the most solemn, purifying
truths of God's word, we must elevate the standard far higher than it is at
the present time. Sin and sinners in the church must be promptly dealt
with, that others may not be contaminated. Truth and purity require that
we make more thorough work to cleanse the camp from Achans. Let those
in responsible positions not suffer sin in a brother. Show him that he must
either put away his sins or be separated from the church."—Testimonies, vol.
5, p. 147.
   2. What reward awaits this class of sinners? 2 Peter 2:13.

   3. To what depths have these apostates fallen? 2 Peter 2:14.

   4. Where were these false teachers formerly found? 2 Peter
2:15, first part.

    NoTE.—The fact that these false teachers were once among the Christians
is evidently the reason why Peter pours out this burning lava of indignation
against them.
   5. By leaving the elect, whose example did they follow? 2 Peter
2:15, 16. Compare Num. 22-25.
                            Total Depravity
   6. What indicates that these depraved teachers had sinned away
their day of grace? 2 Peter 2:17.

    NOTE.—"The apostle now describes these traitors to the cause of Christ
under another aspect. They proffer themselves as guides and teachers. As
such they should be sources of refreshment and help. But in every respect
they belie the character which they have assumed. 'These are springs with-
out water' The blessing of a spring is only known to the full in Eastern
lands. Hence it is that in Bible language wells and fountains are constantly
used as emblematic of happiness. . . . 'With joy shall ye draw water out
of the wells of salvation' (Isa. 12:3). To those who had been accustomed to
language of this sort, St. Peter's words convey a picture of utter disappoint-
ment. Where men had a right to expect that they would find brightness and
refreshment, where they were promised an oasis in the world's desert, there
proved to be only a delusive mirage; and for this the brethren were beguiled
to forsake the living waters which Christ has promised to His faithful ones."
 —The Expositor's Bible, on 2 Peter 2:17.
                                     [81]
  7. Having forsaken the truth, what means do these deceivers
employ to beguile unstable souls? 2 Peter 2:18, first part.

   8. How effective are these libertines in their seductions and
allurements? 2 Peter 2:18, last part.

    NoTE.—"Such men are unspeakably dangerous to those who have made
but little progress in spiritual life. It is only those who, like Nehemiah of
 old, have become firm of purpose through prayer to the God of Heaven, and
know the dangers that everywhere beset them, that can withstand such
temptations. . . . 'They thought to do me mischief.' And his sturdy answer
to the tempters is a pattern and a lesson for all time: 'I am doing a great
work, so that I cannot come down.' For it is always to come down that such
counselors invite us, not to be afraid to put ourselves on their level. . . . They
talk of this as liberty and power, just as the archfiend himself spake to the
Saviour, tempting Him to a boastful display of His trust in His Father: 'Cast
Thyself down.' Those who fall in this way, by a too ready yielding to some
acceptable bait, . . . find themselves, not free, but prisoners. And the weak
in faith, those who are only just escaped from error, are those from among
whom the deluders seek and find their victims."—The Expositor's Bible, on
2 Peter 2:17.
  9. While promising their devotees liberty, what is their real
condition? 2 Peter 2:19.

    NOTE.—"Here we have two views of the same persons. First their own
picture. They proclaim their superiority in lofty terms. Satan and his serv-
ants have always been liberal with promises. 'Ye shall be as gods, knowing
good and evil,' All these things will I give Thee, if Thou wilt fall down and
worship me,' are sample speeches of the archtempter. And these men follow
their master; but, says the apostle, they are themselves in the grossest
slavery."—The Expositor's Bible, on 2 Peter 2:19.
   10. Of what danger are those warned who have been rescued
from the pit of sin? 2 Peter 2:20. Compare Gal. 6:7, 8; 5:1; Heb.
6:4-6.

  11. What two classes of people are described, and how is their
punishment contrasted? 2 Peter 2:21, first part; Heb. 10:26, 27, 29.

    NOTE.—"These words of the apostle point out the fear and care which
should possess the hearts of those whom God blesses with large opportuni-
ties; fear lest they receive them amiss and fail to value them; care lest they
pervert them to wrong use."—The Expositor's Bible, on 2 Peter 2:21.
   12. From what had these false teachers turned away? 2 Peter
2:21, last part.

   NorE.—Here one of the apostle's words is very significant. He says, not
holy commandments but holy commandment, telling us thus that the divine
                                      [ 32 ]
law is all comprehended in the right order of the heart. In principle all God's
laws are one. If that inward source of all right and wrong be kept pure,
from it are the issues of life. This is the freedom of which the psalmist
speaks: "I walk at liberty: for I seek Thy precepts." Ps. 119:45.
   13. With what forceful parable did the apostle illustrate the
evil course of these apostates? 2 Peter 2:22.

   NoTE.—"To describe in all its horror the abysmal depth to which these
false teachers have sunk, the apostle makes use of two proverbs, one of
which he adapts from the Old Testament (Prov. 26:11), while the other is
one which would impress the Jewish mind with a feeling of utter abomina-
tion. . . . Solomon spake this proverb of the fool who goes back to his
folly; but of how much grosser lapse is he guilty who, having known the
mercy of Christ, having tasted the Father's grace, having been illumined by
the Holy Spirit, turns again to the world and its pollutions, goes back into
the far country, far away from God, and chooses again for his food the
husks that the swine did eat !"—The Expositor's Bible, on 2 Peter 2:22.
   14. What exhortation should we heed? Heb. 3:12-14.



                      Lesson 12, for June 21, 1952

                        The Day of the Lord
    LESSON SCRIPTURE: 2 Peter 3:1-10.
    MEMORY VERSE: "The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some
men count slackness; but is long-suffering to usward, not willing that any should per-
ish, but that all should come to repentance." 2 Peter 3:9.
    STUDY HELPS: "The Great Controversy," pages 370-374; "Early Writings,"
pp. 69-71; "Patriarchs and Prophets," pages 101-104; "Testimonies," vol. 2, pp. 183-
199.
    AIM: To enable us to withstand the attack of scoffers and to look forward with
confidence to the soon fulfillment of the promise of the Lord's return.
                           DAILY STUDY ASSIGNMENT
    1. General survey of the lesson.             5. Questions 11-13; read "Patriarchs
    2. Questions 1-4.                                  and Prophets" assignment.
    3. Questions 5-8; read "The Great            6. Read "Testimonies" assignment.
           Controversy" assignment.              7. Review the lesson.
    4. Questions 9, 10; read "Early Writ-
           ings" assignment.

                      The Earnest Call to Be Alert
   1. Why did Peter write his two epistles? 2 Peter 5:1; 1 Peter
1:13-15. Compare Matt. 24:44.

   NoTE.—The fiery flow of prophetical diction which begins with chapter
1:16 comes to a rest at the conclusion of chapter 2. Now in the near prospect
of death and in the face of scoffers, he comes to them in all tenderness to
place around them safeguards against the dangers ahead.
                                        [ 33 ]
    2. How does he bear testimony to the reality of the spiritual
life of his readers? 2 Peter 3:1, last part.

    NarE.—"Stir up your pure minds." "In the previous chapter the apostle
showed how the renegade false teachers had published among the brethren
their seductive doctrine declaring that God's fatherly discipline was something
which they need not undergo, that the trials which He sent them might be
escaped, and the natural bent of man's heart indulged as fully as they
pleased. The foul results of such lessons, both to the flock and to the teach-
ers, he also depicted in such wise as to render them abhorrent."—The Exposi-
tor's Bible, on 2 Peter 3:1.
   3. What is his special appeal in these letters? 2 Peter 3:2.

    Nora.—His appeal is to a pure mind at once opposed to errors in doctrine
and to excuses for the practice of vices. The principal means of safeguard-
ing these Christians is to remind them of the revelations of God, deposited
in the writings of the prophets and the apostles.
   4. Who would arise in the last days? 2 Peter 3:3.

   NoTE.—"When Peter adds the fact that such mockers will proceed with
their mockery 'according to their own lusts,' he indicates that they are of the
same nature as the men described in chapter 2, and that he now describes
their worst crime, their blasphemous mockery. Mockery and lusts will go
together. These are their marks. The appearance of such men is a sign of
days' end."—R. C. H. Lenski, Interpretation of the Epistles of St. Peter, St.
John, and St. Jude, page 339.
    5. What doctrine do the mockers attack in a special way? 2 Pe-
ter 3:4.

    NoTE.—"This mockery is concentrated in the question which the heretics
will fling at the readers: 'Where is the promise of His Parousia [coming],' i.e.,
where is its fulfillment? They mean: 'You say that Jesus promised a great
Parousia [coming] ; well, show it to us, where is it?' Catch the sneer in this.
Catch also the folly. When the Parousia [coming] occurs, such sneers will
die in the mocking throats. Compare Isa. 5:19; Jer. 17:15; Matt. 24:38;
Luke 17:26-30."—R. C. H. Lenski, Interpretation of the Epistles of St. Pe-
ter, St. John, and St. Jude, pages 339, 340.

                        The Thorough Exposure
   6. Regarding what historical event does Peter expose the igno-
rance of the mockers? 2 Peter 3:5.

   NoTE.—"Geologists claim to find evidence from the earth itself that it is
very much older than the Mosaic record teaches. . . . But apart from Bible
history, geology can prove nothing. . . . In the history of the Flood, inspira-
tion has explained that which geology alone could never fathom. In the days
of Noah, men, animals, and trees, many times larger than now exist, were
                                   E 34 l
buried, and thus preserved as an evidence to later generations that the ante-
diluvians perished by a flood. God designed that the discovery of these
things should establish faith in inspired history; but men, with their vain
reasoning, fall into the same error as did the people before the Flood,—the
things which God gave them as a benefit, they turn into a curse by making
a wrong use of them."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 112.

   7. What measure did God employ to correct the willfulness of
the mockers in Noah's time? 2 Peter 3:6.

   8. What future catastrophe awaits the present heavens and
earth? 2 Peter 3:7.

    NOTE.—"In this way Peter answers the assumption of the mockers and
their reasoning that there will never be a Parousia [coming] of Christ. He
simply states the two facts that escape these wise fellows. The one fact lies
in the past, namely, the Flood; the other in the future. The word of God
that by its original creation put the world into such a condition that all liv-
ing things on its surface perished 'by water,' that same word is keeping the
present heavens and earth 'for fire' in order to send the ungodly to perdition,
these mockers being among them."—R. C. H. Lenski, Interpretation of the
Epistles of St. Peter, St. John, and St. Jude, page 34.

                      The Complete Explanation
   9. How does Peter explain the question raised by the mockers
as given in verse 4? 2 Peter 3:8; Ps. 90:4. Compare Rom. 9:22;
1 Peter 3:20.

   NorE.—Now for the sake of Christians who may possibly be themselves
perplexed by the delay, a clear statement is given of the facts of the case.
The explanation is found in the character and purpose of God.
   10. How is the perfect wisdom of God seen in His long-suffer-
ing mercy? 2 Peter 3:9; James 5:7.

    NCTIE.—"Peter furnishes the correct answer: God uses time so as to serve
His purpose of grace. . . . To Him time, whether it be brief or long, is an
entirely minor matter, just so His gracious purpose is accomplished. Look
at it in this way. Then you will not think of delay, dilatoriness, emptiness
of the promise. Then you will see that the Lord's waiting is His long-suffer-
ing toward you, His holding out long with the blessed intention . . . that
none are to perish, but that all are to have room . . . for . . . repentance,
change of mind and heart by contrition and faith. This long-suffering extends
the time, puts off the Parousia. What is a thousand years to the Lord, if He
can thereby bring many to repentance?"—R. C. H. Lenski, Interpretation of
the Epistles of St. Peter, St. John, and St. Jude, page 345.
   11. How does Peter set forth the certainty of Christ's promise,
though seemingly delayed? 2 Peter 3:10. Compare Hab. 2:3.
                                     [35]
   NOTE.-"The day of the Lord will come." Thus the long-suffering is
balanced by the justice, and we are told of, (a) The certainty of the coming:
"Will come." (b) The character of the coming: "As a thief." Compare
Matt. 24:43 ; Luke 12:39; 1 Thess. 5:2; Rev. 3:3; 16:15.
  12. How is the "day of the Lord" described by the prophets?
Zeph. 1:14-18; Joel 3:9-17; Dan. 12:1.

   13. What will be the reward of God's faithful children in that
stupendous hour? Dan. 12:1; Ps. 27:3-6.

    NOTE.—"Soon appeared the great white cloud, upon which sat the Son
of man. When it first appeared in the distance, this cloud looked very small.
The angel said that it was the sign of the Son of man. As it drew nearer the
earth, we could behold the excellent glory and majesty of Jesus as He rode
forth to conquer. A retinue of holy angels, with bright, glittering crowns
upon their heads, escorted Him on His way. . . . The earth trembled before
Him, the heavens departed as a scroll when it is rolled together, and every
mountain and island were moved out of their places. . . . Those who a short
time before would have destroyed God's faithful children from the earth,
now witnessed the glory of God which rested upon them. And amid all their
terror they heard the voices of the saints in joyful strains, saying, 'Lc), this
is our God, we have waited for Him, and He will save us.' "—Early Writ-
ings, pages 286, 287.

                                  Expectation
   1. What word does Peter use to describe the destruction of this
present world? 2 Peter 3:11, first part. Compare Isa. 34:4; 24:19;
Micah 1:3, 4.
                                       [ 36
  2. In view of the impending dissolution of the world, what
urgent appeal does the apostle make? 2 Peter 3:11, last part.
Compare Heb. 10:25.

   NOTE.—"It is now that we must keep ourselves and our children unspotted
from the world. It is now that we must wash our robes of character and
make them white in the blood of the Lamb. It is now that we must over-
come pride, passion, and spiritual slothfulness. It is now that we must
awake and make determined effort for symmetry of character. 'Today if ye
will hear His voice, harden not your hearts.' We are in a most trying posi-
tion, waiting, watching for our Lord's appearing. . . . It is ever God's pur-
pose to bring light out of darkness, joy out of sorrow, and rest out of weari-
ness for the waiting, longing soul."—Testimonies, vol. 5, pp. 215, 216.
   3. What should be the attitude of the real Christian during the
closing days of earth's history? 2 Peter 3:12, first part.

   NOTE.—"When the storm of God's wrath breaks upon the world, it will
be a terrible revelation for souls to find that their house is being swept away
because it is built upon the sand. Let the warning be given them before it is
too late. We should now feel the responsibility of laboring with intense
earnestness to impart to others the truths that God has given for this time.
We cannot be too much in earnest."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 16.
   4. What will be the effect of the conflagration that is to eradi-
cate sin and all of its fruitage? 2 Peter 3:12, last part.

   5. In his final answer to those who mock the return of our
blessed Lord, how does Peter express the glorious climax of his
hope? 2 Peter 3:13, first part.

    NOTE.—" 'We, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new
earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.' All creation was marred at the Fall.
It groaneth and travaileth until now in pain along with the sons of men. It
was made subject unto vanity, but that was by reason of God, who made it
thus subject in hope that it shall be delivered, along with man from the
bondage of corruption. And that victory was promised from the first. The
seed of the woman shall not always be the spoil of the serpent. . . . Hence
St. Peter says, 'According to His promise we look forward.' . . . The believer
heeds no more the mockers who ask, 'Where is the promise of His coming?'
He can look and lift up his head, assured that his redemption draweth nigh."
 —The Expositor's Bible, on 2 Peter 3:13.
   6. In what way will the new world be gloriously different from
the present? 2 Peter 3:13, last part; Rev. 21:3, 4.

    NoTE.—"And the consolation of the promise consists largely in the thought
that in the new creation righteousness will dwell, will make its home. First,
there will be Christ the righteous, who is also our righteousness; and all the
hindrances and stumbling blocks of this life will be removed."—The Exposi
tor's Bible, on 2 Peter 3:13.

            Preparation for the Greatest of All Events
   7. What further fitting exhortation is given to those who are
looking for these things? 2 Peter 3:14. Compare Rev. 19:7, 8;
Eph. 5:27; James 1:27.
   NOTE.—"Christ is waiting with longing desire for the manifestation of
Himself in His church. When the character of Christ shall be perfectly re-
produced in His people, then He will come to claim them as His own."—
Christ's Object Lessons, page 69.
   8. What does Peter say of the long-suffering of God, despite
the doubts of scoffers? 2 Peter 3:15, first part.

   9. What other great apostle agrees with Peter concerning the
long-suffering of God? 2 Peter 3:15, last part. See Rom. 2:4.
   NOTE.—The apostle Paul expressed his feeling concerning God's dealing
with him: "For this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ
might show forth all long-suffering, for a pattern to them which should
thereafter believe on Him to life everlasting." 1 Tim. 1:16.
   10. According to Peter's further statement, what is the burden
of all of Paul's epistles? 2 Peter 3:16, first part. See 1 Cor. 2:9, 10;
Eph. 1:9, 10.
   11. What did Peter say about the difficulty of fully understand-
ing Paul's writings? 2 Peter 3:16, second part.

   12. Because some things in Paul's epistles are hard to under-
stand, what is the result among those who are unstable? 2 Peter
3:16, last part.
    NoTE.—"But in St. Peter's word 'hard to be understood' there appears to
be the thought that men's difficulties arise in part because they look on these
subjects as studies for the intellect alone, and fail for this reason to attain
to the best knowledge which is given to man. It is of God's order that for
the lessons which come from Him He also imparts the power of true dis-
cernment. Those who approach the study of Christian truth as a cold intel-
lectual exercise, in the comprehension of which heart and soul bear no part,
will go away empty, and as dark almost as they come."—The Expositor's
Bible, on 2 Peter 3:16.
  13. What is Peter's final affectionate warning to all Christians
who face like dangers? 2 Peter 3:17. Compare Eph. 3:14-21.
  NoTE.—"The whole passage runs over with Christian affection; a very
working out it is in a believer's life of Christ's teaching, 'By this shall all
men know that ye are My disciples, if ye have love one to another.' Love
                                     [ 38 ]
to the brethren, love to his fellow apostle, breathes in every line of these
final sentences. Beloved are the churches, beloved his fellow laborer. And
he is never weary of repeating that word 'looking for,' which marks the
true attitude of the Christian pilgrim."-The Expositor's Bible, on 2 Peter
3:17.
   14. With what earnest admonition does Peter close his epistle?
2 Peter 3:18.

       THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
               June 28, 1952-Middle East Division
    The overflow from the offering received on June 28 will go to the Middle
East Division to be used in providing needed buildings for the Middle East
College and the Iran Training school, and also to help in opening new work
in Libia. This is a needy field, and we need greatly to strengthen our educa-
tional work so that more workers may be trained to work for their own peo-
ple.
