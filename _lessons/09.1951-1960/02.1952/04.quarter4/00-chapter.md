        LESSONS FROM THE EXPERIENCES
                  OF ISRAEL

                                Introduction
   "Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are
written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come."
1 Cor. 10:11.
   "For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learn-
ing, that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope."
Rom. 15:4.
   "The history of the wilderness life of Israel was chronicled for the benefit of
the Israel of God to the close of time. The record of God's dealings with the
wanderers of the desert in all their marchings to and fro, in their exposure to
hunger, thirst, and weariness, and in the striking manifestations of His power
for their relief, is fraught with warning and instruction for His people in all
ages. . . . God would have His people in these days review with a humble
heart and teachable spirit the trials through which ancient Israel passed, that
they may be instructed in their preparation for the heavenly Canaan."—
Patriarchs and Prophets, page 293.


                    Lesson 1, for October 4, 1952
                       The Call of Abraham
   LESSON SCRIPTURES: Gen. 12:1-9; 15; 22:1-18.
   MEMORY VERSE: "I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth
thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed." Gen. 12:3.
   STUDY HELP: "Patriarchs and Prophets," pages 125-128, 140-144.
                        DAILY STUDY ASSIGNMENT
1. Read introductory note and make a  5. Questions 1.1-13.
     general survey of the lesson.    6. Read "Patriarchs and Prophets,"
2. Questions 1-3.                          pages 125-128, 140-144.
3. Questions 4-7.                     7. Review the lesson.
4. Questions 8-10.

                                 Called Out
  1. What form of apostasy had become prevalent in the days of
Abraham? Joshua 24:2.

   NOTE.—"After the dispersion from Babel, idolatry again became well-nigh
universal.... Abraham had grown up in the midst of superstition and heathen-
ism. Even his father's household, by whom the knowledge of God had been
preserved, were yielding to the seductive influences surrounding them, and they
`served other gods' than Jehovah."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 125.
                                        3
   2. What call came to Abraham? Gen. 12:1.

  3. What similar call does God give to His people in the last
days? Rev. 18:1-4. Compare 2 Cor. 6:17, 18.

    NOTE.—"Many are still tested as was Abraham. They do not hear the voice
of God speaking directly from the heavens, but He calls them by the teachings
of His word and the events of His providence. They may be required to
abandon a career that promises wealth and honor, to leave congenial and
profitable associations, and separate from kindred, to enter upon what appears
to be only a path of self-denial, hardship, and sacrifice. God has a work for
them to do; but a life of ease and the influence of friends and kindred would
hinder the development of the very traits essential for its accomplishment"—
Patriarchs and Prophets, pages 126, 127.
   4. What two essentials of practical godliness were revealed
in the life of Abraham? Heb. 11:8, 9; James 2:21-24.

    NcrrE.—"Abraham's unquestioning obedience is one of the most striking
evidences of faith to be found in all the Bible. To him, faith was 'the substance
of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.' Relying upon the divine
promise, without the least outward assurance of its fulfillment, he abandoned
home and kindred and native land, and went forth, he knew not whither, to
follow where God should lead."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 126.
  5. How was the faithfulness of God's servant to be rewarded?
Gen. 12:2; 17:7, 8.

                         The Purpose of the Call
   6. For what purpose did God call Abraham? Rom. 3:1, 2;
9:4, 5.

   NorE.—"He chose Abraham, of the line of Shem, and made him the keeper
of His law for future generations.... The true faith was not to become extinct.
God has ever preserved a remnant to serve Him. Adam, Seth, Enoch, Me-
thuselah, Noah, Shem, in unbroken line, had preserved from age to age the
precious revealings of His will. The son of Terah became the inheritor of this
holy trust."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 125.
  7. What testimony is borne to Abraham's fidelity to His charge?
Gen. 26:4, 5.

   NorE.—"Faithful among the faithless, uncorrupted by the prevailing apos-
tasy, he steadfastly adhered to the worship of the one true God."—Patriarchs
and Prophets, page 125. •
  8. What signal witness did the patriarch bear to the true God?
Gen. 12:7, 8.
                               4
    NoTE.—"Abraham, 'the friend of God,' set us a worthy example. His was a
life of prayer. Wherever he pitched his tent, close beside it was set up his altar,
calling all within his encampment to the morning and the evening sacrifice.
When his tent was removed, the altar remained. In following years, there were
those among the roving Canaanites who received instruction from Abraham ;
and whenever one of these came to that altar, he knew who had been there
before him; and when he had pitched his tent, he repaired the altar, and there
worshiped the living God."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 128.
   9. In what commendable way did Abraham serve as the pre-
server of the truth of God for the world? Gen. 18:19.

    NOTE.—"It was a high honor to which Abraham was called, that of being
the father of the people who for centuries were the guardians and preservers of
the truth of God for the world. . . . The law of God would be the rule in his
household. ... He [God] had separated Abraham from his idolatrous kindred,
that the patriarch might train and educate his family apart from the seductive
influences which would have surrounded them in Mesopotamia, and that the
true faith might be preserved in its purity by his descendants, from generation
to generation."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pages 140-142.
   10. What contrasting relationship between parents and chil-
dren in the last days is presented to us in the Bible? 2 Tim. 3:1, 2;
Mal. 4:6; Eph. 6:1-4.

    NOTE.—"Abraham's affection for his children and his household led him to
guard their religious faith, to impart to them a knowledge of the divine statutes,
as the most precious legacy he could transmit to them, and through them to the
world. All were taught that they were under the rule of the God of heaven.
There was to be no oppression on the part of parents, and no disobedience on
the part of children. God's law had appointed to each his duties, and only in
obedience to it could any secure happiness or prosperity. . . .
    "How few there are in our day who follow this example! On the part of
too many parents there is a blind and selfish sentimentalism, miscalled love,
which is manifested in leaving children, with their unformed judgment and
undisciplined passions, to the control of their own will. This is the veriest
cruelty to the youth, and a great wrong to the world. Parental indulgence
causes disorder in families and in society."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 142.

                             The Promised Seed
   11. Who was the seed promised to Abraham? Gen. 12:2, 3;
22:18; Gal. 3:16.

   NOTE.—"And to this was added the assurance, precious above every other to
the inheritor of faith, that of his line the Redeemer of the world should come."
—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 125.
   12. By what means was the plan of redemption through Christ
revealed to the patriarch? Gen. 15:9-18; 22:13; Gal. 3:8. Compare
John 8:56.
                                 5
  13. How only are men in every age saved? Gen. 15:6; Rom. 4:3;
Eph. 2:8-10.

   NOTE.—"Faith is the condition upon which God has seen fit to promise
pardon to sinners; not that there is any virtue in faith whereby salvation is
merited, but because faith can lay hold of the merits of Christ, the remedy pro-
vided for sin."—Ellen G. White, Review and Herald, Nov. 4, 1890.


                     Lesson 2, for October 11, 1952
                       The Exodus Movement
   LESSON SCRIPTURES: Exodus 1 and 14; Psalm 105:25-45.
   MEMORY VERSE: "And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still,
and see the salvation of the Lord, which He will show to you today." Ex. 14:13, first
part.
   STUDY HELP: "Patriarchs and Prophets," pages 257-272, 281-290.
                           DAILY STUDY ASSIGNMENT •
1.   General survey of entire lesson.    5. Questions 11-14.
2.   Questions 1-3.                   ,  6. Read selections from "Patriarchs and
3.   Questions 4-6.                            Prophets."
4.   Questions 7-10.                     7. Review the lesson.

                        The Pattern of Persecution
   1. After the passing of Joseph and his generation, how were
the children of Israel treated in Egypt? Ex. 1:9-11, 22.

     2. What was the result of this persecution? Ex. 1:12.

   3. What similar experience will come to the people of God in
the last days? Rev. 13:15-17. Compare 2 Timothy 3:12.

   NOTE.—"A decree will finally be issued against those who hallow the Sab-
bath of the fourth commandment, denouncing them as deserving of the severest
punishment, and giving the people liberty, after a certain time, to put them to
death. Romanism in the Old World, and apostate Protestantism in the New,
will pursue a similar course toward those who honor all the divine precepts."—
The Great Controversy, pages 615, 616.

                              Striking Parallels
   4. What larger deliverance did the prophets envisage? Isa.
11:10-12; Jer. 16:14-16.

    NoTE.—"These prophecies of a great spiritual awakening in a time of gross
darkness, are today meeting fulfillment in the advancing lines of mission sta-
tions that are reaching out into the bgnighted regions of earth. The groups of
                                        [ 6]
missionaries in heathen lands have been likened by the prophet to ensigns set
up for the guidance of those who are looking for the light of truth. . . . The
day of deliverance is at hand."—Prophets and Kings, pages 375, 376.
    5. What agency, used to deliver Israel from bondage, was used
by the Lord to give counsel and guidance to the advent movement
in the last days? Deut. 34:10; Hosea 12:13; Rev. 12:17; 19:10.

    NOTE.—"In ancient times God spoke to men by the mouth of prophets and
apostles. In these days He speaks to them by the Testimonies of His Spirit.
There was never a time when God instructed His people more earnestly than
He instructs them now concerning His will and the course He would have them
pursue."—Testimonies, vol. 4, pp. 147, 148.
   "As the end draws near and the work of giving the last warning to the
world extends, it becomes more important for those who accept present truth
to have a clear understanding of the nature and influence of the Testimonies,
which God in His providence has linked with the work of the third angel's
message from its very rise."—Ibid., vol. 5, p. 654.
   6. At the beginning of his work what reform did Moses insti-
tute? What same reform marks the remnant church? Ex. 5:5;
Isa. 58:12-14; Rev. 12:17; 14:12.

    NOTE.—"In their bondage the Israelites had to some extent lost the knowl-
edge of God's law, and they had departed from its precepts. The Sabbath had
been generally disregarded, and the exactions of their taskmasters made its
observance apparently impossible. But Moses had shown his people that
obedience to God was the first condition of deliverance; and the efforts made
to restore the observance of the Sabbath had come to the notice of their
oppressors."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 258.

                   Manifestations of Satanic Power
  7. What manifestations of satanic power were opposed to the
work of God in Egypt? Ex. 7:11, 12, 22; 8:7.

   NOTE.—"The magicians also showed signs and wonders; for they wrought
not by their own skill alone, but by the power of their god, Satan, who assisted
them in counterfeiting the work of Jehovah. The magicians did not really
cause their rods to become serpents; but by magic, aided by the great deceiver,
they were able to produce this appearance. . . . Such they were believed to be
by Pharaoh and his court."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 264.
   8. How will satanic deceptions be manifested in the last days?
2 Thess. 2:9-12; 2 Cor. 11:14.

                            Divine Judgments
  9. As the rulers of earth in the last days are set to crush the
people of God, what judgments similar to the judgments that fell
upon Egypt will fall upon the rejectors of God's message? Ps.
105:25-36; Revelation 16.
                              [7 ]
    NOTE.—"When Christ ceases His intercession in the sanctuary, the un-
mingled wrath threatened against those who worship the beast and his image
and receive his mark, will be poured out. The plagues upon Egypt when God
was about to deliver Israel, were similar in character to those more terrible and
extensive judgments which are to fall upon the world just before the final
deliverance of God's people."—The Great Controversy, pages 627, 628.
   10. What protection from the plagues of Egypt was provided
for Israel? Concerning the time of the seven last plagues, what
assurance is given the people of God? Ex. 8:23; 9:4, 26; 10:22,
23; 12:13; Psalm 91.

  11. When Pharaoh inquired, "Who are they that shall go?"
what was Moses' firm reply? Ex. 10:8, 9.

    NoTE.—"This experience of the Israelites was written for the instruction of
those who should live in the last days. Before the overflowing scourge shall
come upon the dwellers of the earth, the Lord calls upon all who are Israelites
indeed to prepare for that event. To parents He sends the warning cry: Gather
your children into your own houses; gather them away from those who are
disregarding the commandments of God, who are teaching and practicing evil.
Get out of the large cities as fast as possible. Establish church schools."—
Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 195.
                           A Mighty Deliverance
   12. When Israel faced apparent destruction by the armed host
of Egypt, what mighty deliverance was wrought again? Ex. 14:
21-31.

   13. As the advent people are marked for destruction, what
glorious deliverance will again be wrought? Ps. 50:1-5; 2 Thess.
2:8.

   14. What triumphant song celebrated the deliverance of the
Israelites? Standing victorious on the sea of glass before the throne
of God, what will be the song of the 144,000? Ex. 15:1-16; Rev.
14:1-3; 15:2-4.

                     Lesson 3, for October 18, 1952
                         The Two Covenants
    LESSON SCRIPTURES: Exodus 19:3-9; 24:1-8; Hebrews 8.
    MEMORY VERSE: "For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of
Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put My laws into their mind, and write
them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to Me a people."
Hebrews 8:10.
    STUDY HELP: "Patriarchs and Prophets," pages 363-373.
                                          [8]
                            DAILY STUDY ASSIGNMENT
1.   General survey of the lesson.        5. Questions 12-15.
2.   Questions 1-4.                       6. Read "Patriarchs and Prophets,"
3.   Questions 5-7.                            pages 363-373.
4.   Questions 8-11.                      7. Review the lesson.

                   The Old and the New Covenants
   1. Under what names are God's covenants with His people
designated in the Bible? Heb. 8:7, 13.

   2. With whom did He make the "new" covenant? With whom
was it renewed? Gen. 3:15; 17:7, 8; Jer. 31:31; Rom. 9:4; Heb.
6:13-18.
    NOTE.—"The covenant of grace was first made with man in Eden, when
after the Fall, there was given a divine promise that the seed of the woman
should bruise the serpent's head. To all men this covenant offered pardon, and
the assisting grace of God for future obedience through faith in Christ. It also
promised them eternal life on condition of fidelity to God's law. Thus the pa-
triarchs received the hope of salvation."—Patriarchs and Prophets; page 370.
  3. With whom did God later enter into the "old" covenant?
Ex. 19:3-8; 24:7; Deut. 5:2, 3; Heb. 8:9.

   4. When and how were each of the covenants ratified? Ex. 24:
4-8; Heb. 9:12, 18-21; 10:9; 13:20, last part.

    NOTE.—"Another compact—called in Scripture the 'old' covenant—was
formed between God and Israel at Sinai, and was then ratified by the blood of
a sacrifice. The Abrahamic covenant was ratified by the blood of Christ, and it
is called the 'second,' or 'new' covenant, because the blood by which it was
sealed was shed after the blood of the first covenant. That the new covenant
was valid in the days of Abraham, is evident from the fact that it was then
confirmed both by the promise and by the oath of God,—the 'two immutable
things, in which it was impossible for God to lie.' "—Patriarchs and Prophets,
       .
page 371
                              Better Promises
   5. What was the basis of the first covenant? What did each con-
tracting party agree to do? Wherein lay its weakness? Ex. 19:5-8;
20:1-17; Rom. 8:3; 7:18, 19.

    NOTE.—"The people did not realize the sinfulness of their own hearts, and
that without Christ it was impossible for them to keep God's law; and they
readily entered into covenant with God. Feeling that they were able to estab-
lish their own righteousness, they declared, 'All that the Lord hath said will
we do, and be obedient.' They had witnessed the proclamation of the law in
awful majesty, and had trembled with terror before the mount; and yet only
a few weeks passed before they broke their covenant with God, and bowed
down to worship a graven image. They could not hope for the favor of God
through a covenant which they had broken; and now, seeing their sinfulness
                                      [9]
and their need of pardon, they were brought to feel their need of tne Saviour
revealed in the Abrahamic covenant, and shadowed forth in the sacrificial
offerings."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pages 371, 372.
  6. How was the new covenant superior to the old? Ezek. 20:11;
Deut. 27:26; Heb. 8:6.

   NoTE.—"The terms of the 'old covenant' were, Obey and live: `If a man
do, he shall even live in them;' but 'cursed be he that confirmeth not all the
words of this law to do them.' The 'new covenant' was established upon 'better
promises,'—the promise of forgiveness of sins, and of the grace of God to renew
the heart, and bring it into harmony with the principles of God's law."—Patri-

                   A More Excellent Ministry
   7. What difference was there between the ministry of the priest-
hood of the old covenant, and the mediatorial work 'of the High
Priest of the new covenant? Heb. 7:22-27; 4:14-16; 2:18.

   NOTE.—"Christ alone had experience in all the sorrows and temptations
that befall human beings. Never another of woman born was so fiercely beset
by temptation; never another bore so heavy a burden of the World's sin and
pain. Never was there another whose sympathies were so broad or so tender.
A sharer in all the experiences of humanity, He could feel not only for, but
with, every burdened and tempted and struggling one."—Education, page 78.
  8. Under the ceremonial law, what were the sacrifices and, blood
unable to do? Heb. 10:1-4.

   9. What is accomplished by the atoning sacrifice and blood of
the Lamb of God? John 1:29, margin; Matt. 26:28; 1 Peter 1:18,
19; 1 John 1:7.

    NOTE.—"When the sinner believes that Christ is his personal Saviour then,
according to His unfailing promises, God pardons his sin, and justifies him
freely. The repentant soul realizes that his justification comes because Christ,
as his substitute and surety, has died for him, is his atonement and righteous-
ness."—Ellen G. White, Review and Herald, Nov. 4, 1890.

                    The Law Written in the Heart
   10. Under the new covenant where is the law written? By what
agency is this work accomplished? Heb. 8:8-12; 2 Cor. 3:3.

    NoTE.—"The same law that was engraved upon the tables of stone, is
written by the Holy Spirit upon the tables of the heart. Instead of going about
to establish our own righteousness, we accept the righteousness of Christ. His
blood atones for our sins. His obedience is accepted for us. Then the heart
renewed by the Holy Spirit will bring forth 'the fruits of the Spirit.' Through
the grace of Christ we shall live in obedience to the law of God written upon
our hearts."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 372.
                                      [ 10 ]
   11. How does this experience affect the life? 2 Cor. 5:17.

   12. What words will then describe the life of the believer? Ps.
1:1-3; Ezek. 11:19, 20.

   13. What is the fruitage of such an experience? Gal. 5:22-24.

   NoTE.—"As you receive the Spirit of Christ,—the spirit of unselfish love
and labor for others,—you will grow and bring forth fruit. The graces of the
Spirit will ripen in your character. Your faith will increase, your convictions
deepen, your love be made perfect. More and more you will reflect the likeness
of Christ in all that is pure, noble, and lovely."—Christ's Object Lessons,
page 68.
   14. What will be the end of those who, knowing the truth, sin
willfully, despising the blood of the covenant? Heb. 10:26-29.

  15. With what benediction, through the blood of the covenant,
does Paul close the treatise on the two covenants? Heb. 13:20, 21.


                     Lesson 4, for October 25, 1952
                            A Chosen People •
    LESSON SCRIPTURES: Deut. 28:1-13; Daniel 1.
    MEMORY VERSE: "And the Lord skall make thee the head, and not the tail;
and thou shalt be above only, and thou shalt not be beneath; if that thou hearken unto
the commandments of the Lord thy God, which I command thee this day, to observe and
to do them." Deut. 28:13.
    STUDY HELP: "Prophets and Kings," pages 479-490, 503-521, 539-548.

1. General survey of the lesson.        5. Questions 12-14.
2. Questions 1-4.                       6. Read selections from "Prophets and
3. Questions  5-7.                           Kings."
4. Questions 8-11.                      7. Review the lesson.

                          Thou Shalt Be the Head
  1. What was God's high purpose for His people? Deut. 7:6;
26:18, 19; 28:13, first part.

    NOTE.—"Higher than the highest human thought can reach is God's ideal
for His children." "God surrounded Israel with every facility, gave them every
privilege, that would make them an honor to His name and a blessing to sur-
rounding nations. If they would walk in the ways of obedience, He promised
to make them 'high above all nations which He hath made, in praise, and in
name, and in honor.' "—Education, pages 18, 40.
                                    I. 11
   2. Upon what condition would this ideal be reached? Deut.
6:17, 18; 28:13 (last part), 14.

   3. What two great principles underlying the law are essential
in attaining the divine standard? Deut. 6:5; Lev. 19:18; Matt. 22:
35-40.

   4. How diligently were the divine precepts to be studied and
taught? Deut. 4:9, 10; 6:6-9; Joshua 1:7, 8.

    NOTE.—"Here the duties of parents are clearly set forth. The word of God
is to be their daily monitor. It gives such instruction that parents need not err
in regard to the education of their children; but it admits of no indifference or
negligence. The law of God is to be kept before the minds of the children as
the great moral standard. When they rise up, and when they sit down, when
they go out, and when they come in, this law is to be taught them as the great
rule of life, and its principles are to be interwoven with all their experience."—
Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 329.

                         The Light of the World
  5. What, in the divine purpose, was to be Israel's influence
upon the nations? Deut. 4:6.

   NOTE.—"It was God's purpose that by the revelation of His character
through Israel men should be drawn unto Him. To all the world the gospel
invitation was to be given. Through the teaching of the sacrificial service,
Christ was to be uplifted before the nations, and all who would look unto Him
should live. All who, like Rahab the Canaanite, and Ruth the Moabitess, turned
from idolatry to the worship of the true God, were to unite themselves with
His chosen people. As the numbers of Israel increased, they were to enlarge
their borders, until their kingdom should embrace the world."—Christ's Ob-
ject Lessons, page 290.
   6. As a result of obedience to God's statutes what object lesson
in health were the Israelites to be to the nations about them? Ex.
15:26; Ps. 105:37.

    NOTE.—"Had the Israelites obeyed the instruction they received, and
profited by their advantages, they would have been the world's object lesson
of health and prosperity. If as a people they had lived according to God's
plan, they would have been preserved from the diseases that afflicted other
nations. Above any other people they would have possessed physical strength,
and vigor of intellect. They would have been the mightiest nation on the
earth."—The Ministry of Healing, page 283.
    7. What rich blessings were to follow faithfulness in paying
tithes and offerings? What would the nations call the Israelites?
Mal. 3:8-12.
                                      [ 12 ]
                  The Superiority of the Divine Plan
  8. What demonstration of the superiority of the divine plan
was given in the experience of King Solomon? 2 Chron. 9:22, 23.

   9. Wherein lay the excellency of the divine principles of edu-
cation given to Israel? Rom. 3:1, 2; John 5:39; 17:3.

    NOTE.—"He who created the mind and ordained its laws, provided for its
development in accordance with them. In the home and the sanctuary, through
the things of nature and of art, in labor and in festivity, in sacred building and
memorial stone, by methods and rites and symbols unnumbered, God gave to
Israel lessons illustrating His principles, and preserving the memory of His
wonderful works. Then, as inquiry was made, the instruction given impressed
mind and heart."—Education, page 41.
   10. In Babylon what early test came to the Hebrew captives?
How convincingly were the advantages of the divine way of living
revealed? Dan. 1:8-16.

    NOTE.—"They [Daniel and his companions] decided that as flesh meat had
not composed their diet in the past, it should not come into their diet in the
future, and as wine had been prohibited to all who should engage in the service
of God, they determined that they would not partake of it. The fate of the
sons of Aaron had been presented before them, and they knew that the use of
wine would confuse their senses, that the indulgence of appetite would becloud
their powers of discernment. These particulars were placed on record in the
history of the children of Israel as a warning to every youth to avoid all cus-
toms and practices and indulgences that would in any way dishonor God."—
Ellen G. White, The Youth's. Instructor, Aug. 18, 1898. Reprinted Nov. 9, 1948.

   11. How did even a heathen king judge the product of the
divine system of education when compared with the ablest com-
petitors in the realm? Dan. 1:17-20.

    NoTE.—"At the court of Babylon were gathered representatives from all
lands, men of the highest talent, men the most richly endowed with natural
gifts, and possessed of the broadest culture that the world, could bestow; yet
among them all, the Hebrew youth were without a peer. In physical strength
and beauty, in mental vigor and literary attainment, they stood unrivaled. The
erect form, the firm, elastic step, the fair countenance, the undimmed senses,
the untainted breath,—all were so many certificates of good habits, insignia of
the nobility with which nature honors those who are obedient to her laws."—
Prophets and Kings, page 485.
  12. In selecting a prime minister for Medo-Persia, how did
Kings Darius and Cyrus successively manifest appreciation of
Daniel's superior qualifications? Dan. 6:1-3, 28.

   13. When Israel had utterly failed to represent Jehovah before
                                       [ 13 ]
the world, how was God's purpose accomplished through a few
faithful captives? Dan. 3:28, 29; 4:1-3, 37; 6:25-27; Ezra 1:1-3.

   14. How does Daniel's experience demonstrate the outworking
of the divine precepts committed to Israel? Dan. 1:17, 20; 2:48;
6:3.

   NorE.—The prophecies of Daniel are a guiding star of the people of God in
these last days, carrying past the rise and fall of empires to the setting up of the
kingdom of God, when Daniel will be numbered with those who "shine as the
brightness of the firmament; and ... as the stars for ever and ever."

                           Lessons From the Past
  1. Why are the experiences of Israel recorded? 1 Cor. 10:11;
Rom. 15:4.

    Nom.—"Modern Israel are in greater danger of forgetting God and being
led into idolatry than were His ancient people. . . . The sins, and iniquities
of rebellious Israel are recorded and the picture presented before us as a warn-
ing that if we imitate their example of transgression and depart from God we
shall fall as surely as did they ."---T estimonies, vol. 1, p. 609.
   2. What wonderful works of God should have inspired un-
swerving faith and loyalty in His people? Ps. 78:12 -16; 105:26, 27;
1 Cor. 10:1-4.

  3. What is the sad record of Israel's forgetfulness of God?
What are we bidden to remember? Ps. 106:12-14, 21, 22; Isa. 46:9.

     NOTE.—"In reviewing our past history, having traveled over every step of
advance to our present standing, I can say, Praise God! As I see what the Lord
                                       [ 14 ]
has wrought, I am filled with astonishment, and with confidence in Christ as
leader. We have nothing to fear for the future, except as we-shall forget the
way the Lord has led us, and His teaching in our past history."—Life
Sketches, page 196.
   4. In what miraculous way had God provided food in the
wilderness? Ex. 16:14-18; Ps. 78:23-25.

  5. What was man's original diet, appointed by the Creator?
What is the divine plan for those who, are preparing to meet their
Lord? Gen. 1:29; 3:18.
   NOTE.—"Again and again I have been shown that God is trying to lead us
back, step by step, to' His original design,—that man should subsist upon the
natural products of the earth. Among those who are waiting for,the coming of
the Lord, meat eating will eventually be done away; flesh will cease to form a
part of their diet."—Christian Temperance, and Bible Hygiene, page 119.

                       Abstain From Fleshly Lusts
   6. Beginning with the mixed multitude, for what did the chil-
dren of Israel clamor? Num. 11:4-6; Ps. 78:18-20.

   7. How was their request granted? With what results? Num.
11:31-34; Ps. 78:26-32; 106:15.
   8. To what admonition should we take earnest heed? 1 Cor.
10:6; 1 Peter 2:11.
   NoTE.—"The selfish', health-destroying indulgences of men and women have
counteracted the influence of the message that is to prepare a people for the
great day of God. If the churches expect strength, they must live the truth
which God has given them. If the members of our churches disregard the light
on this subject, they will reap the sure result in both spiritual and physical
degeneracy."—Testimonies, vol. 6, pp. 370, 371.

                        Temples of the Holy Spirit
  9. By creation and by redemption what is God's design for us?
Gen. 1:27; Ps. 139:14; 1 Cor. 3:16, 17; 6:19, 20.
   NOTE.—"Let pupils be impressed with the thought that the body is a
temple in which God desires to dwell; that it must be kept pure, the abiding
place of high and noble thoughts. As in the study of physiology they see that
they are indeed 'fearfully and wonderfully made,' they will bd inspired with
reverence. Instead of marring God's handiwork, they will have an ambition to
make all that is possible of themselves, in order to fulfill the Creator's glorious
plan. Thus they will come to regard obedience to the laws of health, not as a
matter of sacrifice or self-denial, but as it really is, an inestimable privilege and
blessing."—Education, page 201.
                                          15
  10. In the light of God's high purpose, what principle should
control our lives? Rom. 12:1; 1 Cor. 9:25-27; 10:31.

   NOTE.—"When we realize the requirements of God, we shall see that He
requires us to be temperate in all things. The end of our creation is to glorify
God in our bodies and spirits, which are His. How can we do this when we
indulge the appetite to the injury of the physical and moral powers? God re-
quires that we present our bodies a living sacrifice. Then the duty is enjoined
on us to preserve that body in the very best condition of health, that we may
comply with His requirements."—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 65.
   11. What testimony was borne of Enoch prior to his transla-
tion? Gen. 5:24; Heb. 11:5.

   12. What similar preparation is to be made by those• now wait-
ing for the coming of the Lord? 1 Thess. 5:23; 1 John 3:2, 3.

    NOTE.—"In the midst of a world by its iniquity doomed to destruction,
Enoch lived a life of such close communion with God that he was not permitted
to fall under the power of death. The godly character of this prophet represents
the state of holiness which must be attained by those who shall be 'redeemed
from the earth' at the time of Christ's second advent. . . . Like Enoch, God's
people will seek for purity of heart, and conformity to His will, until they shall
reflect the likeness of Christ."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pages 88, 89.
  13. By what mighty agencies is this transformation of character
wrought? John 1:12, 13; John 17:17; Rom. 15:16; 1 Peter 1:2.

   NOTE.—"The Lord Jesus is making experiments on human hearts through
the exhibition of His mercy and abundant grace. He is affecting transforma-
tions so amazing that Satan, with all his triumphant boasting, with all his
confederacy of evil united against God and the laws of His government, stands
viewing them as a fortress impregnable to his sophistries and delusions. Whey
are to him an incomprehensible mystery."—Testimonies to Ministers, page 18.

Deut. 1:22-24.

   2. How did this report affect the people? What step did they
propose to take? Num. 14:1-4.

    NOTE.—"Hope and courage gave place to cowardly despair, as the spies
uttered the sentiments of their unbelieving hearts, which were filled with dis-
couragement prompted by Satan. Their unbelief cast a gloomy shadow over the
congregation, and the mighty power of God, so often manifested in behalf of
the chosen nation, was forgotten. . . . When men yield their hearts to unbelief,
they place themselves under the control of Satan, and none can tell to what
lengths he will lead them. . . . Revolt and open mutiny quickly followed; for
Satan had full sway, and the people seemed bereft of reason."—Patriarchs and
Prophets, pages 388, 389.
  3. How did Caleb and Joshua try to counteract the evil influ-
ence of their faithless associates? How did the people respond?
How was the madness of the mob halted? Num. 13:30; 14:6-10.

   4. Because of their unbelief and murmuring, what would be
the fate of the adult members of the congregation apart from
Joshua and Caleb? What reckless prayer was answered? Num.
14:26-38, 2, last part.

   NoTE.—"Because of their unbelief and cowardice He could not manifest His
power to subdue their enemies. Therefore in His mercy He bade them, as the
only safe course, to turn back toward the Red Sea. In their rebellion the people
had exclaimed, 'Would God we had died in this wilderness!' Now this prayer
was to be granted. . . . As the spies had spent forty days in their journey, so
the hosts of Israel were to wander in the wilderness forty years."—Patriarchs
and Prophets, page 391.

                   Parallel in the Advent Movement
  5. What admonition drawn from this experience is given us?
Heb. 3:19; 4:1.

   6. What attitude on the part of those who profess to 1-7 look-
ing for the second coming of Christ has hindered the fulfillment
of the promise? Matt. 24:12; 25:1-5; Rev. 3:14-17.

    NoTE.—"It was not the will of God that Israel should wander forty years in
the wilderness; He desired to lead them directly to the land of Canaan, and
establish them there, a holy, happy people. But 'they could not enter in because
                                      [ 17 3
of unbelief.' . . . In like manner, it was not the will of God that the coming of
Christ should be so long delayed, and His people should remain so many years
in this world of sin and sorrow. But unbelief separated them from God."—The
Great Controversy, page 458.
    "Had the church of Christ done her appointed work as the Lord ordained,
the whole world would before this have been warned, and the Lord Jesus would
have come to our earth in power and great glory."—The Desire of Ages, pages
633, 634.

                          .The Divine Remedy
   7. What is the remedy for this situation? Rom. 13:11; Joel
2:12-17; Rev. 3:18-20.

   NOTE.—"A revival of true godliness among us is the greatest and most
urgent of all our needs. To seek this should be our first work. . . . There is
nothing that Satan fears so much as that the people of God shall clear the way
by removing every hindrance, so that the Lord can pour out His Spirit upon a
languishing church and an impenitent congregation. . . . When the way is
prepared for the Spirit of God, the blessing will come."—Ellen G. White, Re-
view and Herald, March 22, 1887.

   8. What assurance _have we that the, work will be finished
quickly by a mighty outpouring of the Spirit in all its fullness?
Joel 2:28-32; James 5:7, 8; Rom. 9:28.

    NOTE.—"In visions of.the night, representations passed before me of a great
reformatory movement among God's people. Many were praising God. The
sick were healed, and other miracles were wrought. A spirit of intercession was
seen, even as was manifested before the great Day of Pentecost. Hundreds and
thousands were seen visiting families and opening before them the word of God.
Hearts were convicted by the power of the Holy Spirit, and a spirit of genuine
conversion was manifest. On every side doors were thrown open to the procla-
mation of the truth. The world seemed to be lightened with the heavenly
influence."--Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 126.

    9. How only may we share in this refreshing? Acts 3:19.

   NoTE.—"I saw that none could share the 'refreshing,' unless they obtain the
victory over every besetment, over pride, selfishness, love of the world, and
over every wrong word and action."—Early Writings, page 71.

                        The Moment Triumphant

                                      [ 18 ]
   NOTE.—"God has a church upon the earth who are His chosen people, who
keep His commandments. He is leading, not stray offshoots, not one here and
one there, but a people."—Testimonies to Ministers, page 61.
   11. What is said of those who fall away from the movement?
1 John 2:19; Heb. 10:39.
   NOTE.—"The numbers of this company had lessened. Some had been
shaken out and left by the way. The careless and indifferent, who did not join
with those who prized victory and salvation enough to perseveringly plead
and agonize for it, did not obtain it, and they were left behind in darkness, and
their places were immediately filled by others taking hold of the truth and
coming into the ranks."—Early Writings, page 271.

  12. What is characteristic of those who reach Canaan in both
movements? Heb. 11:30; 10:38; Rev. 14:12.

                       The Rebellion in the Camp
  1. While the children of Israel were chafing under the require-
ment to return to the wilderness, what formidable conspiracy
developed? Num. 16:1-3.
   NOTE.—"A temptation, slight at first, had been harbored, and had strength-
ened as it was encouraged, until their minds were controlled by Satan, and
they Ventured upon their work of disaffection. Professing great interest in the
prosperity of the people, they first whispered their discontent to one another,
and then to leading men of Israel. Their insinuations were so readily received
that they ventured still further, and at last they really believed themselves to
be actuated by zeal for God. .. . Jealousy had given rise to envy, and envy to
rebellion."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pages 396, 397.
  2. What test did Moses propose to prove the divine call? How
was the challenge accepted? Num. 16:4-7, 16-19.

   3. What merciful warning was given the congregation? In
fulfillment of Moses' startling declaration, what fate befell the
                                      [ 19 ]
rebellious leaders and their families? What judgment came upon
the two hundred and fifty princes? Num. 16:23-35.
   4. In spite of all these judgments, what evil course did the con-
gregation pursue toward Moses and Aaron on the morrow? How
many were slain by the plague? By whose intervention was the"
judgment stayed? Num. 16:41-50.
                            The Lesson for Us
   5. What warning comes to us from this experience? 1 Cor.
10:10.
    NoTE.—"Do not the same evils still exist that lay at the foundation of
Korah's ruin? Pride and ambition are widespread; and when these are cher-
ished, they open the door to envy, and a striving for supremacy; the soul is
alienated from God, and unconsciously drawn into the ranks of Satan. Like
Korah and his companions; many, even of the professed followers of Christ,
are thinking, planning, and working so eagerly for self-exaltation, that in order
to gain the sympathy and support of the people, they are ready to pervert the
truth, falsifying and misrepresenting the Lord's servants, and even charging
them with the base and selfish motives that inspire their own hearts."—
Patriarchs and Prophets, pages 403, 404.
   6. How are those regarded who lightly bring accusation against
divinely appointed leaders? 2 Peter 2:10, 11; 1 Tim. 5:19.
                 Apostasy on the Borders of Canaan
   7. At the request of the Moabites, how many times did Balaam
try to curse Israel, and with what results? Why could he not bring
a curse upon the people of God? Num. 23:8, 12, 21, 23; 24:10-13.
    NoTE.—"While they were under the divine protection, no people or nation,
though aided by all the power of Satan, should be able to prevail against them.
All the world should wonder at the marvelous work of God in behalf of His
people,—that a man determined to pursue a sinful course, should be so con-
trolled by divine power as to utter, instead of imprecations, the richest and
most precious promises, in the language of sublime and impassioned poetry."—
Patriarchs and Prophets, page 449.

  8. How were the children of Israel beguiled into idolatry?
Num. 25:1-3; 31:15, 16.
   NOTE.—"Balaam knew that the prosperity of Israel depended upon their
obedience to God, and that there was no way to cause their overthrow but by
seducing them into sin. . . . If they could be led to engage in the licentious
worship of Baal and Ashtaroth, their omnipotent Protector would become their
enemy, and they would soon fall a prey to the fierce, warlike nations around
them."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 451.
   9. How was the Lord's anger manifested? How many were
slain in the plague that followed? Num. 25:4, 5, 9.
                                       20
    NOTE.—"Great numbers of the people joined him [Balaaml in witnessing
the festivities. They ventured upon the forbidden ground, and were entangled
in the snare of Satan. Beguiled with music and dancing, and allured by the
beauty of heathen vestals, they cast off their fealty to Jehovah. As they united
in mirth and feasting, indulgence in wine beclouded their senses, and broke
down the barriers of self-control. Passion had full sway; and having defiled
their consciences by lewdness, they were persuaded to bow down to idols."—
Patriarchs and Prophets, page 454.

   10. What heart conditions precede a moral downfall? 1 Cor.
10:12; James 1:13-15. Compare Song of Solomon 2:15.

   NoTE.—"It was when the Israelites were in a condition of outward ease and
security that they were led into sin. They failed to keep God ever before them,
they neglected prayer, and cherished a spirit of self-confidence. . . . A long
preparatory process, unknown to the world, goes on in the heart before the
Christian commits open sin. The mind does not come down at once from
purity and holiness to depravity, corruption, and crime."—Patriarchs and
Prophets, page 459.

   11. What fundamental principle applies in the shaping of
character for good or evil? 2 Cor. 3:18; Prov. 4:23; 23:7, first part.

   NOTE.—"By beholding, we become changed. . . . The mind is educated to
familiarity with sin. The course pursued by the base and vile is kept before the
people in the periodicals of the day, and everything that can excite passion is
brought before them in exciting stories. . . . In every gathering for pleasure
where pride is fostered or appetite indulged, where one is led to forget God and
lose sight of eternal interests, there Satan is binding his chains about the soul."
—Patriarchs and Prophets, pages 459, 460.
    We may well consider the detrimental influence of popular movies and tele-
vision today.

   12. As the people of God approach the borders of the heavenly
Canaan, how will Satan seek to destroy their souls? 2 Thess. 2:9,
10; Rev. 12:12.

   NOTE.—"All along through the ages there are strewn wrecks of character
that have been stranded upon the rocks of sensual indulgence. As we approach
the close of time, as the people of God stand upon the borders of the heavenly
Canaan, Satan will, as of old, redouble his efforts to prevent them from entering
the goodly land. He lays his. snares for every soul. It is not the ignorant and
uncultured merely that need to be guarded; he will prepare his temptations for
those in the highest positions, in the most holy office; if he can lead them to
pollute their souls, he can through them destroy many."—Patriarchs and
Prophets, pages 457, 458.

   13. How may we successfully stand against the wiles of the
enemy of our souls? 2 Peter 1:4; Eph. 6:10-13; Phil. 4:8; Ps. 119:
9, 11.

                    Lesson 8,     for   November 22, 1952

                Lessons From the Life of Moses
   LESSON SCRIPTURE: Exodus 2 to 4.
    MEMORY VERSE: "Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God,
than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season; esteeming the reproach of Christ greater
riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompense of the
reward." Heb. 11 :25, 26.
   STUDY HELP: "Patriarchs and Prophets," pages 241-256, 469-480.
                           DAILY STUDY ASSIGNMENT
1.   General survey of the lesson.       5. Questions 10-12.
2.   Questions 1-3.                      6. Read selections from "Patriarchs
3.   Questions 4, 5.                          and Prophets."
4.   Questions 6-9.                      7. Review the lesson.

                         An Overruling Providence
   1. What circumstances surrounded the birth of Moses? How
did his parents manifest their faith? Ex. 2:2-4; Heb. 11:23.

    NOTE.—"The babe was 'a goodly child;' and the parents, believing that the
time of Israel's release was drawing near, and that God would raise up a de-
liverer for His people, determined that their little one should not be sacrificed.
Faith in God strengthened their hearts, 'and they were not afraid of the king's
commandment.' "—Patriarchs and Prophets, pages 242, 243.
   2. By what providential means were Satan's efforts to destroy
Israel overruled to provide a deliverer? Ex. 2:8-10; Acts 7:19-21.

   NOTE.—"How far-reaching in its results was the influence of that one
Hebrew woman, and she an exile and a slave I The whole future life of Moses,
the great mission which he fulfilled as the leader of Israel, testifies to the 'im-
portance of the work of the Christian mother. There is no other work that can
equal this. . . . She is dealing with developing minds and characters, working
not alone for time, but for eternity. . .. She has not to paint a form of beauty
upon canvas or to chisel it from marble, but to impress upon a human soul the
image of the divine."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 244.
  3. How was Moses qualified to become the future ruler of
Egypt? Acts 7:22.

                              The Great Decision
   4. When Moses attained to manhood, what unfaltering deci-
sion did he make? Why? Ex. 2:11-15; Acts 7:23-29; Heb. 11:
24-27.

    NoTE.—"With the world before him, he had the moral strength to refuse the
flattering prospects of wealth and greatness and fame. . . . Moses had been
instructed in regard to the final reward to be given to the humble and obedient
servants of God, and worldly gain sank to its proper insignificance in compari-
                                      [ 22 ]
son. The magnificent palace of Pharaoh and the monarch's throne were held
out as an inducement to Moses; but he knew that the sinful pleasures that make
men forget God, were in its lordly courts. He looked beyond the gorgeous
palace, beyond-a monarch's crown, to the high honors that will be bestowed on
the saints of the Most High in a kingdom untainted by sip."—Patriarchs and
Prophets, page 246.
   5. How long was Moses in the wilderness? Acts 7:30.

                             The Call of God
   6. Describe the call of Moses to his lifework. Ex. 3:1-11; Acts
7:30-34.

    NOTE.—"The time for Israel's deliverance had come. But God's purpose was
to be accomplished in a manner to pour contempt on human pride. The de-
liverer was to go forth as a humble shepherd, with only a rod in his hand; but
God would make that rod the symbol of His power."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
page 251.
     7. How was Moses to prove his call to deliver Israel? When
he still demurred, what assurance was given? Ex. 4:1-12.

    NOTE.—"The divine command given to Moses found him self-distrustful,
slow of speech, and timid. He was overwhelmed with a sense of his incapacity
to be a mouthpiece for God to Israel. But having once accepted the work, he
entered upon it with his whole heart, putting all his trust in the Lord. The
greatness of his mission called into exercise the best powers of his mind. God
blessed his ready obedience, and he became eloquent, hopeful, self-possessed,
and well fitted for the greatest work ever given to man."—Patriarchs and
Prophets, page 255.

                          A Faithful Shepherd
   8. What characteristics of a true shepherd were manifested by.
Moses as he led a murmuring and backsliding people? Ex. 32:9-
14, 32; Ps. 106:23.

    NOTE.—"God had proved His servant; He had tested his faithfulness, and
his love for that erring, ungrateful people, and nobly had Moses endured the
trial. His interest in Israel sprung from no selfish motive. The prosperity of
God's chosen people was dearer to him than personal honor, dearer than the
privilege of becoming the father of a mighty nation."—Patriarchs and Proph-
ets, page 319.

  9. Near the close of his lifework what single mistake marred
Moses' long years of faithful service? Because of this what privilege
was denied him? Num. 12:3; 20:10-12; Ps. 106:32, 33.

  NOTE.—"Moses was not guilty of a great crime, as men would view the
matter; his sin was one of common occurrence. The psalmist says that 'he
                                 [ 23
spake unadvisedly with his lips.' To human judgment this may seem a light
thing; but if God dealt so severely with this sin in His most faithful and hon-
ored servant, He will not excuse it in others. . . . The more important one's
position, and the greater his influence, the greater is the necessity that he
should cultivate patience and humility."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 420.
                 The Death and Resurrection of Moses
  10. What record of the death and burial of Moses is given?
Deut. 34:5, 6, 10-12.

   NoTE.—"Many who had been unwilling to heed the counsels of Moses while
he was with them, would have been in danger of committing idolatry over his
dead body, had they known the place of his burial. . . . But angels of God
buried the body of His faithful servant, and watched over the lonely grave."—
Patriarchs and Prophets, pages 477, 478.
  11. How did the Lord reward His faithful servant? Jude 9;
Rom. 5:14.

   NoTE.—"He was not long to remain in the tomb. Christ Himself, with the
angels who had buried Moses, came down from heaven to call forth the sleeping
saint. . . . He was raised to immortal life, holding his title in the name of the
Redeemer."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pages 478, 479.
  12. What is the last recorded Scriptural incident concerning
Moses? Matt. 17:3, 4.

  • NOTE.—"Moses upon the mount of transfiguration was a witness to Christ's
 victory over sin and death. He represented those who shall come forth from the
 grave at the resurrection of the just. Elijah, who had been translated to heaven
,without seeing death, represented those who will be living upon the earth at
 Christ's second coming. . . . The Saviour's promise to the disciples was now
 fulfilled. Upon the mount the future kingdom of glory, was represented in
 miniature,—Christ the King, Moses a representative of the risen saints, and
 Elijah of the translated ones."—The Desire of Ages, pages 421, 422.

   STUDY HELP: "Patriarchs and Prophets," pages 481-498.
                            DAILY STUDY ASSIGNMENT
1.   General survey of the lesson.          5. Questions 11-14.

                            The Test of Faith
   1. What was the condition of the Jordan at the time of its
crossing by the children of Israel? What act of faith was per-
formed by the priests who bore the ark of the covenant? How
was the power of God manifested? Joshua 3:14-17.

    NOTE.—"The influence of the miracle, both upon the Hebrews and upon
their enemies, was of great importance. It was an assurance to Israel of God's
continued presence and protection,—an evidence that He would work for them
through Joshua as He had wrought through Moses.... This exercise of divine
power in behalf of Israel was designed also to increase the fear with which they
were regarded by the surrounding nations, and thus prepare the way for their
easier and complete triumph."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pages 484, 485.
   2. What description of the impregnable defenses of the cities
of Canaan was true of Jericho? Num. 13:28; Deut. 9:1.

    NOTE.—"One of the strongest fortresses in the land,—the large and wealthy
city of Jericho,—lay just before them, but a little distance from their camp at
Gilgal. On the border of a fertile plain abounding with the rich and varied
productions of the tropics, its palaces and temples the abode of luxury and vice,
this proud city, behind its massive' battlements, offered defiance to the God of
Israel."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 487.
   3. What unusual instructions were given for the capture of
Jericho? How faithfully were these instructions carried out?
Joshua 6:1-20.

   NOTE. "The Captain of the Lord's host communicated only with Joshua;
He did not reveal Himself to all the congregation, and it rested with them to
believe or doubt the words of Joshua, to obey the commands given by him in
the name of the Lord, or to deny his authority. They could not see the host of
angels that attended them under the leadership of the Son of God. . . . But
the very plan of continuing this ceremony through so long a time prior to the
final overthrow of the walls, afforded opportunity for the development of faith
among the Israelites."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 493. '
   4. What resulted when the forces of Israel had compassed the
city seven times on the seventh day? Joshua 6:15, 16, 20.

    NOTE.—"How easily the armies of heaven brought down the walls of
Jericho, that proud city whose bulwarks, forty years before, had struck terror
to the unbelieving spies! . . . God will do great things for those who trust in
Him. The reason why His professed people have no greater strength, is that
they trust so much to their own wisdom, and do not give the Lord an oppor-
tunity to reveal His power in their behalf."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pages
492, 493.
   5. What fate befell the city and its inhabitants? Why were
they destroyed? Joshua 6:21-24.
                                25
      01 L.—lne Lanaannes ban abanclonea themselves to the toulest and most
debasing heathenism; and it was necessary that the land should be cleared of
what would so surely prevent the fulfillment of God's gracious purposes. . . .
Like the men before the Flood, the Canaanites lived only to blaspheme Heaven
and defile the earth. And both love and justice demanded the prompt execu-
tion of these rebels against God, and foes to man."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
page 492.
               The Results of Overconfidence and Sin
   6. What town was next attacked? With what results? Joshua
7:2-5.

   7. In the disposition of the spoil of Jericho, what positive in-
struction had been given? As Joshua and the elders fell on their
faces before the Lord, what were they commanded to do? Joshua
6:18, 19; 7:6-11.

    NOTE.—"When the church is in difficulty, when coldness and spiritual de-
clension exist, giving occasion for the enemies of God to triumph, then, instead
of folding their hands and lamenting their unhappy state, let its members
inquire if there is not an Achan in the camp. With humiliation and searching
of heart, let each seek to discover the hidden sins that shut out God's presence."
—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 497.
   8. Why had Israel suffered ignominious defeat? How was the
guilty man detected? Joshua 7:12-18. •

  9. When concealment became impossible, what confession did
Achan make? How was this confirmed? Joshua 7:20-23.

    NOTE.—"The deadly sin that led to Achan's ruin had its root in covetous-
ness, of all sins one of the most common and the most lightly regarded. While
other offenses meet with detection and punishment, how rarely does the viola-
tion of the tenth commandment so much as call forth censure. The enormity
of this sin, and its terrible results, are the lessons of Achan's history."—Patri-
archs and Prophets, page 496.
   10. In the punishment of Achan, what warning is given?
Joshua 7:24-26; Eccl. 8:11-13.

                             The Lesson for Us -
   11. How impossible is it to hide our sin from God? How
searching will the judgment be? Ps. 139:1-12; 1 Cor. 4:5.

    NorE.—"So long as they can conceal their transgressions from'their fellow
men, many, like Achan, feel secure, and flatter themselves that God will not be
strict to mark iniquity. All too late their sins will find them out in that day
when they shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering forever. When the
records of heaven shall be opened, the Judge will not in words declare to man
                                      [26 ]
his guilt, but will cast one penetrating, convicting glance, and every deed, every
transaction of life, will be vividly impressed upon the memory of the wrong-
doer."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 498.
  12. What admonition is given in the Bible concerning covet-
ousness? Luke 12:15; Eph. 5:3; Col. 3:5.

    NorE.—"I saw that Satan bade his angels lay their snares especially foY
those who were looking for Christ's second appearing, and keeping all the
commandments of God. . . . 'Go, make the possessors of lands arid money
drunk with cares. If you can make them place their affections upon these
things, we shall have them yet. They may profess what they please, only make
them care more for money than for the success of Christ's kingdom or the
spread of the truths we hate. Present the world before them in the most at-
tractive light, that they may love and idolize it.' "—Early Writings, page 266.
   13. To what does all covetousness and self-seeking lead? Matt.
25:28-30.

   14. What outstanding example do we have of the blessedness
of giving? John 3:16; Phil. 3:5-11.



                   Lesson 10, for December 6, 1952

              Lessons From the Life of Solomon
   LESSON SCRIPTURES: 1 Kings 3; 4:20-34; 11:1-13.
   MEMORY VERSE: "There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the
end thereof are the ways of death." Prov. 14:12.
   STUDY HELP: "Prophets and Kings," pages 25-86.
                            DAILY STUDY ASSIGNMENT

                             Solomon's Wisdom
   1. What invitation did God extend to Solomon in a dream at
the beginning of his reign? What was Solomon's choice? How
was the divine approval manifested? 1 Kings 3:5-15.

   NOTE.—"Solomon was never so rich or so wise or so truly great as when he
confessed, 'I am but a little child: I"know not how to go out or come in.' Those
who today occupy positions of trust should seek to learn the lesson taught by
Solomon's prayer. The higher the position a man occupies; the greater the re-
sponsibility that he has to bear, the wider will be the influence that he exerts,
and the greater his need of dependence on God."—Prophets and Kings, page 30.
                                       [ 27 ]
   2. What test of Solomon's wisdom established his reputation
with his subjects? 1 Kings 3:16-28.

   3. How did Solomon seek to gain a clearer conception of the
love and power and wisdom of the Creator? How did his divinely
inspired wisdom find expression? 1 Kings 4:29-33.

    NOTE—"Solomon took an especial interest in natural history, but his re-
searches were not confined to any one branch of learning. Through a diligent
study of all created things, both animate and inanimate, he gained a clear con-
ception of the Creator. In the forces of nature, in the mineral and the animal
world, and in every tree and shrub and flower, he saw a revelation of God's
wisdom; and as he sought to learn more and more, his knowledge of God and
his love for Him constantly increased."—Prophets and Kings, page 33.

                       Witnessing to All Nations
   4. What evidences of the prosperity of Israel under the rule of
Solomon are presented in the Inspired Record? 1 Kings 4:22-26;
10:21-27.

   5. What did God purpose to accomplish through Israel? Deut.
4:5, 6.

    NOTE.—"The wisdom and righteousness revealed by the king bore witness to
all nations of the excellency of the attributes of the God whom he served. For
a time Israel was as the light of the world, showing forth the greatness of
Jehovah. . . . None understood better than he that it was through the favor
of Jehovah that he had come into possession of power and wisdom and under-
standing, and that these gifts were bestowed that he might give to the world a
knowledge of the King of kings."—Prophets and Kings, pages 32, 33.

  6. How wonderfully was the purpose of God accomplished
during the first part of Solomon's reign? What testimony did the
Queen of Sheba bear? 1 Kings 10:6-9, 24.

    NOTE.—"The name of Jehovah was exalted and held in honor, and the pur-
pose for which the Israelites bad been established in the Land of Promise bade i
fair of meeting with fulfillment. Barriers were broken down, and seekers after
truth from the lands of the heathen were not turned away unsatisfied. Con-
versions took place, and the church of God on earth was enlarged, and pros-
pered."—Prophets and Kings, page 25.

   7. What outstanding monument did Solomon erect to the glory
of God? If Solomon and Israel had remained true to God, how
long would this, temple have stood? How widely would it have
served as a center of worship? 1 Kings 6:1, 37, 38; Isa. 56:6, 7;
Jer. 17:24, 25.
                                      28
                     Danger of Worldly Alliances
  8. Foreseeing the perils.which would beset the rulers of Israel,
what instruction had Moses left on record? What specific caution
was given? How and why did Solomon violate this instruction?
Deut. 17:17-20; 1 Kings 3:1; 11:1, 2.

     NoTE.—"In seeking to strengthen his relations with the powerful kingdom
lying to the southward of Israel, Solomon ventured upon forbidden ground.
. .. He reasoned that political and commercial alliances with the surrounding
nations would bring these nations to a knowledge of the true God; and he
entered into unholy alliance with nation after nation. Often these alliances
were sealed by marriages with heathen princesses. The commands of Jehovah
were set aside for the customs of surrounding peoples."—Prophets and Kings,
pages 52-54.
     9. What was the inevitable consequence of disregarding the
divine counsel? Deut. 7:3, 4; 1 Kings 11:3-8.
    NOTE.—"So gradual was Solomon's apostasy that before he was aware of it,
he had wandered far from God. Almost imperceptibly he began to trust less
and less in divine guidance and blessing, and to put confidence in his own
strength. Little by little he withheld from God that unswerving obedience
which was to make Israel a peculiar people, and he conformed more and more
closely to the customs of the surrounding nations. . . . As he cast off his al-
legiance to God, he lost the mastery of himself. His moral efficiency was gone.
His fine sensibilities became blunted, his conscience seared."—Prophets. and
Kings, pages 55-57.
                             Perils of Prosperity
   10. In the erection of the tabernacle, in the wilderness, what
spirit was manifested by the people? In planning for the building
of the temple, on what basis did David make his appeal? Ex. 25:2;
35:21, 22; 1 Chron. 29:5, 9.

   11. How was the self-sacrificing spirit of earlier days lost sight
of by the builders of the temple? How far-reaching was this self-
seeking influence? 2 Chron. 2:7, 13-15.
    NoTE.—"Because of his unusual skill, Huram demanded large wages. Grad-
ually the wrong principles that he cherished came to be accepted by his asso-
ciates. . . . The spirit of self-denial left them, and in its place came the spirit
of covetousness. The result was a demand for higher wages, which was granted.
The baleful influences thus set in operation permeated all branches of the Lord's
service, and extended throughout the kingdom. . . . In the far-reaching effects
of these influences, may be traced one of the principal causes of the terrible
apostasy of him who once was numbered among the wisest of mortals."—
Prophets and Kings, page 64.
   12. What warning is given against glorying in riches or
 honor? Jer. 9:23, 24; Luke 14:11.
                                       [ 29 ]
    NOTE.—"Another of the deviations from right principles that finally led to
the downfall of Israel's king, was his yielding tp the temptation to take to him-
self the glory tat belongs to God alone.... Raised to a pinnacle of greatness,
and surrounded with the gifts of fortune, Solomon became dizzy, lost his
balance, and fell. . . . Man cannot show greater weakness than by allowing
men to ascribe to him the honor for gifts that are Heaven-bestowed."—Proph-
ets and Kings, pages 65-68.
   13. What experiences show that. Solomon became greatly in-
terested in gathering to himself riches and power? Eccl. 2:4-10;
1 Kings 9:26-28.

  14. Returning to God in his old age, how did Solomon regard
wealth and power and worldly pleasures? What earnest appeal
does he leave on record? Eccl. 2:11; 11:9; 12:1, 8.

    NorE.—"By his own bitter experience, Solomon learned the emptiness of a
life that seeks in earthly things its highest good. . . . Chastened in spirit, with
mind and body enfeebled, he turned wearied and thirsting from earth's broken
cisterns, to drink once more at the fountain of life."—Prophets and Kings,
pages 76, 77.

                           The Elijah Message •
    LESSON SCRIPTURE: 1 Kings 17 to 19.
    MEMORY VERSE: "Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the
coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord: and he shall turn the heart of the
fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and
smite the earth with a curse." Mal. 4:5, 6.
    STUDY HELP: "Prophets and Kings," pages 143-189.

2.   Questions 1-3.                       6. Read selections from "Prophets and
3.   Questions 4-7.                            Kings."
4.   Questions 8-10.                      7. Review the lesson.
                            Withholding the Rain
   1. Because of Israel's apostasy, what startling message was Elijah
commissioned to deliver to the wicked king, Ahab? What warning
had been given through Moses? 1 Kings 17:1; Deut. 11:13-17; 28:
15, 23, 24.
   NOTE.—"The priests still insisted that it was through the power of Baal that
the showers of rain fell. . . . Determined to keep the people in deception, the
priests of Baal continue to offer sacrifices to their gods, and to call upon them
night and day to refresh the earth.... But no clouds appear in the heavens by
day to hide the burning rays of the sun. No dew or rain refreshes the thirsty
earth.... Yet notwithstanding these evidences of God's power, Israel repented
not."—Prophets and Kings, pages 123-125.
                                         [30 ]
   2. How was Elijah provided for during the long famine?
1 Kings 17:2-9, 14-16.

   3. What did Ahab and Jezebel seek to do to Elijah? At the
end, of three and a half years of desolating drought, what face-to-
face challenge did Elijah give to Ahab? 1 Kings 18:10, 17-19.

                           The Power of Faith
  4. In the presence of all Israel assembled on Mount Carmel,
what test did Elijah propose? How long did the priests of Baal
continue their desperate appeals? 1 Kings 18:20-29.

   5. After the priests of Baal had demonstrated the helplessness
of their gods, what did Elijah proceed to do? How many times
were the sacrifice and the wood saturated with water? 1 Kings,
18:30-35.

   6. In response to Elijah's petition, what marvelous revelation of
divine power was witnessed by the people? What was their heart-
felt reaction? What was the fate of the prophets of Baal? 1 Kings
18:36-40.

   7. How did Elijah demonstrate his faith that God would send
rain? How fully was his faith justified? 1 Kings 18:41-46; James
5:17, 18.
   NOTE.—"Faith such as this is needed in the world today,—faith that will lay
hold on the promises of God's word, and refuse to let go until Heaven hears.
Faith such as this connects us closely with Heaven, and brings us strength for
coping with the powers of darkness. . . . With the persevering faith of Jacob,
with the unyielding persistence of Elijah, we may present our petitions to the
Father, claiming all that He has promised. The honor of His throne is staked
for the fulfillment of His word."—Prophets and Kings, pages 157, 158.

                "I Will Send You Elijah the Prophet"
   8. What last-day conditions are similar to those of Elijah's
time? 2 Tim. 3:1-5, 13; 4:3, 4.

    NOTE.—"The present age is one of idolatry, as verily as was that in which
Elijah lived. No outward shrine may be visible; there.may be no image for the
eye to rest upon; yet thousands are following after the gods of this world,—
atter riches, fame, pleasure, and the pleasing fables that permit man to follow
the inclinations of the unregenerate heart. Multitudes have a wrong conception
of God and His attributes, and are as truly serving a false god as were the wor-
shipers of Baal."—Prophets and Kings, page 177.
                                     [311
  9. In the midst of the prevailing apostasy, how many in Israel
had not bowed the knee to Baal? In the final apostasy of the last
days, who alone will not bow in false worship? 1 Kings 19:18;
Rev. 13:8; 14:12.

   NOTE.—"Among earth's inhabitants, scattered in every land, there are those
who have not bowed the knee to Baal. Like the stars of heaven, which appear
only at night, these faithful ones will shine forth when darkness covers the
earth and gross darkness the people. In heathen Africa, in the Catholic lands
of Europe and of South America, in China, in India, in the islands of the sea,
and in all the dark corners of the earth, God has in reserve a firmament of
chosen ones that will yet shine forth amidst the darkness, revealing clearly to an
apostate world the transforming power of obedience to His law."—Prophets
and Kings, pages 188, 189.
    10. Before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the
Lord, what messenger will be sent? What application did Jesus
make of this prophecy? Mal. 4:5, 6; Matt. 11:11, 14; Luke 1:13, 17;
Isa. 40:3, 9, 10.
  11. What message will prepare a people for the great day of
God? Rev. 14:6-11; 18:1-5.

     NOTE.—"False religion may prevail, iniquity may abound, the love of many
may wax cold, the cross of Calvary may be lost sight of, and darkness, like the
pall of death, may spread over the world; the whole force of the popular cur-
rent may be turned against the truth; plot after plot may be formed to over-
throw the people of God; but in the hour of greatest peril, the God of Elijah
will raise up human instrumentalities to bear a message that will not be silenced.
.,.. Earnestly will they call upon men and women to turn from the observance
of a man-made institution to the observance of the true Sabbath."—Prophets
and Kings, pages 186, 187.
   12. What characteristics of John the Baptist are to be found in
those who prepare the way for the coming of the Lord? Luke 1:
15; Matt. 3:4.

    NOTE. "John was a reformer. . . . The simplicity of his dress, a garment
woven of camel's hair, was a standing rebuke to the extravagance and display
of the Jewish priests, and of the people generally. His diet, purely vegetable, of
locusts and wild honey, was a rebuke to the indulgence of appetite and the
gluttony that everywhere prevailed. . . . God has shown that health reform is
as closely connected with the third angel's message as the hand is with the
body."—Testimonies, vol. 3, p. 62.
  13. In what triumphant experience is Elijah a type of the
advent people? 2 Kings 2:11; Matt. 17:1-3; 1 Thess. 4:16, 17.

    NOTE.—"Elijah was a type of the saints who will be living on the earth at
the time of the second advent of Christ, and who will be 'changed, in a moment,
in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump,' without tasting of death."—
Prophets and Kings, page 227.

                          Why Israel Failed
   MEMORY VERSE: "0 Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and
stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children
together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!"
Matt. 23:37.
   STUDY HELPS: "Prophets and Kings," pages 15-22; "The Great Controversy,"
chapter 1.
                         DAILY STUDY ASSIGNMENT
1. General survey of the lesson.             6. Read selections from "Prophets and
2. Questions 1-3.                                  Kings" and "The Great Contro-
3. Questions. 4-6.                                 versy."
4. Questions 7-10.                            7. Review the lesson.
5. Questions 11-14.
                        Conforming to the World
   1. How highly had Israel been favored as a nation? How com-
pletely were they to be separated from the world? Deut. 7:6;
26:18, 19; Num. 23:9.
   2. How fully was the corrupting influence of the Canaanites to
be removed from the earth? What was the result of Israel's failure
to carry out this instruction? Deut. 7:2; 20:16; Judges 1:27-36;
Ps. 106:34-38.
    NOTE.—"Regardless of their high destiny, they chose the course of ease
and self-indulgence; they let slip their opportunities for completing the con-
quest of the land; and for many generations they were afflicted by the remnant
of these idolatrous peoples. . . . They intermarried with the Canaanites, and
idolatry spread like a plague. . . . By their sins the Israelites were separated
from God; His strength was removed from them, and they could no longer
prevail against their enemies."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pages .544, 545.
   3. In the days of Samuel, what further step was taken to become
like the surrounding nations? 1 Sam. 8:19, 20.

    NOTE.—" 'Like all the nations.'—The Israelites did not realize that to be
in this respect unlike other nations was a special privilege and blessing. God
had separated the Israelites from every other people, to make them His own
peculiar treasure. But they, disregarding this high honor, eagerly desired
to imitate the example of the heathen ! And still the longing to conform to
worldly practices and customs exists among the professed people of God."—
Patriarchs and Prophets, page 607.
           Ignoring the Messages of the Prophets
  4. Upon what two things did the prosperity of the people of
God depend? Joshua 1:7, 8; 2 Chron. 20:20; Prov. 29:18.

    5. What attitude of leaders and people toward the messages of
                                       [ 33 ]
the prophets contributed greatly to the downfall of Israel? Jer.
36:23, 24; 2 Chron. 36:14-16; Hosea 4:6.
                           A Lost Opportunity
   6. When ambassadors from Babylon came to inquire concern-
ing the power that had healed Hezekiah and turned the sundial
back, what fatal mistake did King Hezekiah make? Because of
Hezekiah's failure to witness for God, what fate would befall his
people? Isaiah 39; 2 Chron. 32:25, 31.

   NOTE.—"What momentous transformations might have taken place had
these seekers after truth from the plains of Chaldea been led to acknowledge
the supreme sovereignty of the living God ! But pride and vanity took pos-
session of Hezekiah's heart, and in self-exaltation he laid open to covetous eyes
the treasures with which God had enriched His people.. . . Not to glorify God
did he do this, but to exalt himself in the eyes of the foreign princes. . . . How
disastrous the results which were to follow !"—Prophets and Kings, pages
344-346.
  7. What practical lesson may we learn from this experience?
James 3:5, last part; Prov. -15:23; 25:11.

    Nora.—"Great thoughts, noble aspirations, clear perceptions of truth, un-
selfish purposes, yearnings for piety and holiness, will find expression in words
that reveal the character of the heart treasure. Those with whom we asso-
ciate day by day need our help, our guidance. They may be in such a condition
of mind that a word spoken in season will be as a nail in a sure place. Tomor-
row some of these souls may be where we can never reach them again. . . .
One reckless movement, one imprudent step, and the surging waves of some
strong temptation may sweep a soul into the downward path. We cannot
gather up the thoughts we have planted in human minds."—Prophets and
Kings, page 348.
   8. What general conditions led to the Babylonian captivity?
Jer. 25:4-11; 17:27; Ezek. 8:16; Hosea 4:1, 2.
                       The Cause of Israel's Doom
  9. In the days of Christ's earthly ministry, what fatal mistake
were the Jews making? Matt. 15:1-3, 6-9.

   NOTE.—"Priests and scribes and rulers were fixed in a rut of ceremonies and
traditions. . . . They thought their own righteousness all-sufficient. . . . They
clung to the dead forms, and turned away- from the living truth and the power
of God. It was this that proved the ruin of the Jews, and it will prove the ruin
of many souls in our own day."—The Desire of Ages, pages 278-280.
   10. What false principle permeated the Jewish religion? Rom.
10:2, 3.

   NoTE.—"The principle that man can save himself by his own works lay at
                                 1 343
the foundation of every heathen religion. . . . Satan had implanted this prin-
ciple. . . . The people whom God had called to be the pillar and ground of the
truth had become representatives of Satan.... The very priests who ministered
in the temple had lost sight of the significance of the service they performed.
They had ceased to look beyond the symbol to the thing signified. . . . The
ordinances which God Himself had appointed were made the means of blinding
the mind and hardening the heart. God could do no more for man through
these channels. The whole system must be swept away."—The Desire of Ages,
page 36.
    11. What happened to the barren fig tree? What did this para-
ble mean? Mark 11:13, 14, 20.

   NorE.—"The Saviour desired to make plain to His disciples the cause and
the certainty of Israel's doom. . . . They were corrupted by the love of the
world and the greed of gain. . . . They yielded 'nothing but leaves.' . . . Love
to God and man was eclipsed by pride and self-sufficiency. They brought ruin
upon themselves by refusing to minister to others. The treasures of truth which
God had committed to them, they did not give to the world. In the barren tree
they might read both their sin and its punishment."—The Desire of Ages, pages
582, 583.
  12. What final step sealed the doom of the chosen people?
Matt. 21:37-43.

    Nora.—"When Christ should hang upon the, cross of Calvary, Israel's day
as a nation favored and blessed of God would be ended."—The Great Contro-
versy, page 21.
                            A Solemn Warning
   13. Gazing upon Jerusalem from the crest of Olivet at the close
of His earthly ministry, what fateful words did Jesus utter? Matt.
23:37, 38; Luke 19:41-44.

    NOTE.—"Every ray of light rejected, every warning despised or unheeded,
every passion indulged, every transgression of the law of God, is a seed sown,
which yields its unfailing harvest. The Spirit of God, persistently resisted, is at
last withdrawn from the sinner, and then there is left no power to control the
evil passions of the soul, and no protection from the malice and enmity of Satan.
The destruction of Jerusalem is a fearful and solemn warning to all who are
trifling with the offers of divine grace, and resisting the pleadings of divine
mercy."—The Great Controversy, page 36.
   14.. What prediction of Moses was fulfilled in the downfall of
Jerusalem, and in the scattering of the people? Deut. 28:52-57,
64-67; Lam. 4:2-11.

   "The Saviour's prophecy concerning the visitation of judgments upon
Jerusalem is to have another fulfillment, of which that terrible desolation was
but a faint shadow. In the fate of the chosen city we may behold the doom of
a world that has rejected God's mercy and trampled upon His law."—The
Great Controversy, pages 35, 36.

tiles? Isa. 11:10; 42;1, 6; 49:6; Hosea 1:10.

  4. With what figure does Paul illustrate the bringing in of the
Gentiles? Rom. 11:17-25.
   NOTE.—"Paul likens the remnant in Israel to a noble olive tree, some of

Apostles, page 377.
  5. Who constitute the true Israel of God? Rom. 2:28, 29; 9:6-8;
Gal. 3:7, 16, 28, 29.

the high destiny to which God had called them; in their unbelief had failed to
become the light of the world; though they had despised God's mercy, and for-
feited their blessings as His chosen people,—yet God had not cast off the seed
                                      36 ]
of Abraham; the glorious purposes which He had undertaken to accomplish
through Israel were to be fulfilled. All who, through Christ, should become the
children of faith, were to be counted as Abraham's seed; they were inheritors
of the covenant promises; like Abraham they were called to guard and to make
known to the world the law of God and the gospel of His Son."—Patriarchs and

back by the great plan of redemption. All that was lost by sin has been restored.

Isa. 9:6, 7; 24:23; Luke 1:32, 33; Rev. 22:1-3; 21:3.

    NoTE.—"It was Satan's purpose to bring about an eternal separation be-
tween God and man; but in Christ we become more closely united to God than
if we had never fallen. In taking our nature, the Saviour has bound Himself to
humanity by a tie that is never to be broken. Through the eternal ages He is

      THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
          December 27, 1952—Southern Asia Division
    The overflow from the offering taken up on December 27 has been al-
located to the Southern Asia Division, and the brethren there have decided
upon two special projects. One is the establishing of our training school in
South India in a new location. For some years our teachers have faced in-
creasing pressure for urgently needed space in both land and buildings. An
excellent new location has now been purchased with over forty acres of fine
soil on which can be grown all the food needed for the future development
of this school. They are asking our help in putting up the necessary build-
ings on this land.
    The second project is the establishment of an evangelistic center among
the people of the Lushai Hills, Northeast India. A, vast new territory is just
 now opening to our message for the first time. The challenge is one of the
greatest in the whole division. Let us all do everything we can to provide
 for these needs this coming thirteenth Sabbath.
