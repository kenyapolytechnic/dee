Son of the living God." Matt. 16:16.

88, 185, 186; "Steps to Christ," chapter 1; "Testimonies," vol. 4, pp. 485-489.

                   Peter's Early Life and Character
  1. Who were members of Peter's family, according to New
Testament records?
   ANSWER: His father, Jona, John 1:42; his brother, Andrew, John 1:40;
his wife and wife's mother, Mark 1:30.
   2. Where was Peter's home? What was his occupation? John
1:44; Mark 1:16.

   3. What indications do we have of his spiritual interests? John
1:38-41.

   NOTE.—The fact that Peter lived in Bethsaida of Galilee, and yet was
with his brother Andrew attending the Baptist's revival in Judea on the
banks of the Jordan (Matt. 3:1, 5), would indicate that he was among
those who "were waiting for the consolation of Israel" (Luke 2:25). When
Andrew said to Peter, "We have found the Messias," it would seem that
their attention had been caught by the preaching of John the Baptist and
that they were looking for Him.
                                         3
   4. What were some of the weaknesses of Peter's character?

   (a)   Self-confidence                    Luke 22:33.
   (b)   Boastfulness                       Mark 14:29.
   (c)   Self-interest                      Matt. 19:27
   (d)   Disloyalty                         Mark 14:66-6$
   (e)   Deceitfulness                      Mark 14:70, 71 (See The Desire
   •                                          of Ages, page 712.)
   (f) Impulsiveness                        John 18:10.
   NOTE.—"Before his fall, Peter was- always speaking unadvisedly, from the
impulse of the moment. He was always ready to correct others, and to ex-
press his mind, before he. had a clear comprehension of himself or of what
he had to say."—The Desire of Ages, page 812.

                             Peter Meets Jesus
    5. Whom did God use to win the heart of Peter? John 1:40-42,
first part.

   NOTE.—"Andrew sought to impart the joy that filled his heart. Going in
search of his brother Simon, he cried, 'We have found the Messias.' Simon
waited for no second bidding. He also had heard the preaching of John the
Baptist, and he hastened to the Saviour."—The Desire of Ages, page 139.
  6. In what way did Jesus manifest divine insight in reading
Peter's heart? John 1:42.

   NoTE.—"The eye of Christ rested upon him, reading his character and
his life history. His impulsive nature, his loving, sympathetic heart, his
ambition and self-confidence, the history of his fall, his repentance, his labors,
and his martyr death—the Saviour read it all, and He said, 'Thou art Simon
the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A
stone.' "—The Desire of Ages, page 139.

                             Peter's Confession
   7. What varied opinions were held concerning Jesus? Matt.
16:13, 14.

    NoTE.—"Sadly the disciples were forced to acknowledge that Israel had
failed to recognize their Messiah."—The Desire of Ages, page 411.
  8. What searching question did Jesus ask, and what was Peter's
positive reply? Matt. 16:15, 16.

  NoTE.—"We may rest fully assured that these glowing words of Simon
Peter went up, like fragrant incense, to the throne of God, and refreshed the
                                      141
heart of the One who sat there. There is nothing in all the world so precious
to God as a heart that, in any measure, appreciates Christ. Let us never
forget this."—C. H. Mackintosh, Simon Peter, page 32.
   9. Who was the source of Peter's revelation? Matt. 16:17.

               Christ the Foundation of the Church

   10. What fundamental scriptural truth is revealed in Christ's
reply to Peter? Matt. 16:18; Deut. 32:4; 1 Cor. 3:11; 10:4; Eph.
2:19-22.


    NorE.—"The word Peter signifies a stone,—a rolling stone. Peter was not
the rock upon which the church was founded. The gates of hell did prevail
against him when he denied his Lord with cursing and swearing. The church
was built upon One against whom the gates of hell could not prevail. Cen-
turies before the Saviour's advent Moses had pointed to the Rock of Israel's
salvation. The psalmist had sung of 'the Rock of my strength.' Isaiah had
written, 'Thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a
stone, a tried stone, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation.' Peter him-
self, writing by inspiration, applies this prophecy to Jesus."—The Desire of
Ages, pages 412, 413.
  11. What assurance did Jesus give regarding the eventual tri-
umph of His church? Matt. 16:18, last part.


    NoTE.—"The church is God's fortress, His city of refuge, which He holds
in a revolted world. Any betrayal of the church is treachery to Him who has
bought mankind with the blood of His only-begotten Son. . . . He has sent
forth His angels to minister to His church, and the gates of hell have not
been able to prevail against His people."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 11.
   12. What authority did Christ confer on the church? Matt.
16:19.


   NOTE.-" 'The keys of the kingdom of heaven' are the words of Christ.
All the words of Holy Scripture are His, and are here included. These words
have power to open and to shut heaven. They declare the conditions upon
which men are received or rejected. Thus the work of those who preach
God's word is a savor of life unto life or of death unto death. Theirs is a
mission weighted with eternal results.
   "The Saviour did not commit the work of the gospel to Peter individually.
At a later time, repeating the words that were spoken to Peter, He applied
them directly to the church. And the same in substance was spoken also to
the Twelve as representatives of the body of believers. If Jesus had dele-
gated any special authority to one of the disciples above the others, we
should not find them so often contending as to who should be the greatest."
—The Desire of Ages, page 414.

    LESSON SCRIPTURES: Luke 5:1-11; 9:27-37.

shalt catch men. And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and

2. Questions 1-4; memorize Luke 5:          of Ages," pages 244, 251.

                                            review the lesson.

  1. What did Jesus request of Peter as they stood by the lake of
Gennesaret? Luke 5:1-3.

    NorE.—"What a scene was this for angels to contemplate; their glorious
Commander, sitting in a fisherman's boat, swayed to and fro by the restless
waves, and proclaiming the good news of salvation to the listening throng
that were pressing down to the water's edge ! . . . Every message from His
lips came to some soul as the word of eternal life."----The Desire of Ages,
pages 244, 245.
    2. What further request did Jesus make to Peter? Luke 5:4.

   3. After acknowledging a night of failure, what response did
Peter make? Luke 5:5.

   NOTE. "Night was the only favorable time for fishing with nets in the
clear waters of the lake. After toiling all night without success, it seemed
hopeless to cast the net by day; but Jesus had given the command, and
love for their Master moved the disciples to obey. Simon and his brother
together let down the net."—The Desire of Ages, pages 245, 246.
    4. How was his obedience rewarded? Luke 5:6, 7.

   5. How did this miracle affect the conscience of Peter? Luke
5:8.

   NorE.—"This miracle, above any other he had ever witnessed, was to him
a manifestation of divine power. In Jesus he saw One who held all nature
under His control. The presence of divinity revealed his own unholiness.
Love for his Master, shame for his own unbelief, gratitude for the conde-
scension of Christ, above all, the sense of his uncleanness in the presence of
                                        [8 1
infinite purity, overwhelmed him. While his companions were securing the
contents of the net, Peter fell at the Saviour's feet, exclaiming, 'Depart from
me; for I am a sinful man, 0 Lord.'"—The Desire of Ages, page 246.
   6. How does an Old Testament character.,record a comparable
experience? Isa. 6:5, 7.

    NOTE. "When Isaiah beheld the glory of the Lord, he exclaimed, 'Woe is
me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in
the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the
Lord of hosts.' Humanity, with its weakness and sin, was brought in con-
trast with the, perfection of divinity, and he felt altogether deficient and
unholy. Thus it has been with all who have been granted a view of God's
greatness and majesty."—The Desire of Ages, page 246.

                         The Call and Response

   7. With what assuring words did Jesus reply to Peter's confes-
sion of his sinfulness? Luke 5:10; Matt. 4:19.

   NOTE.—" 'Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men.' Such was the
grace that shone upon the soul of Peter. It removed his guilt, hushed his
fears, and filled him with joy and peace in believing. Thus it is in every case.
Divine pardon follows human confession—follows it with marvelous ra-
pidity. 'I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord: and Thou
forgavest the iniquity of my sin.' God delights to pardon. It is the joy of
His loving heart to cancel our guilt, and fill our souls with His own blessed
peace, and to make us the messengers of His grace to others."—C. H. Mackin-
tosh, Simon Peter, page 23.
   ft. What was the response of Peter and his companions to the
call of the Master? Luke 5:11.

           Peter's Misunderstanding of Christ's Mission

  9. What experience indicates that Peter's knowledge of the
mystery of the cross was very incomplete? Matt. 16:21-23.

     NoTE.—"The disciples still expected Christ to reign as a temporal prince.
. . . That the hatred of the priests and rabbis would never be overcome, that
Christ would be rejected by His own nation, condemned as a deceiver, and
crucified as a malefactor,—such a thought the disciples had never enter-
tained."—The Desire of Ages, page 415.
   10. What indicates that Peter still failed to comprehend whz
Jesus was trying to teach him? Luke 9:33; Mark 9:5, 6.

   NoTE.—"The disciples do not yet comprehend the scene; but they re-
joice that the patient Teacher, the meek and lowly One, who has wandered
                                     [ 3
to and fro a helpless stranger, is honored by the favored ones of heaven.
They believe that Elijah has come to announce the Messiah's reign, and that
the kingdom of Christ is about to be set up on the earth. . . . The disciples
are confident that Moses and Elijah have been sent to protect their Master,
and to establish His authority as King."—The Desire of Ages, page 422.
  11. What caused the disciples to be afraid,- and what divine
announcement did they hear? Luke 9:34, 35.

    NoTa.—"Failing to watch and pray, they had not received that which
God desired to give them,—a knowledge of the sufferings of Christ, and the
glory that should follow. . . . Yet they received great light. They were
assured that all heaven knew of the sin of the Jewish nation in rejecting
Christ. They were given a clearer insight into the work of the Redeemer.
They saw with their eyes and heard with their ears things that were beyond
the comprehension of man. They were 'eyewitnesses of His Majesty' (2 Peter
1;16), and they realized that Jesus was indeed the Messiah, to whom pa-
triarchs and prophets had witnessed, and that He was recognized as such by
the heavenly universe."—The Desire of Ages, page 425.
  12. What specific predictions did Jesus 'continue to make, and
how were they received by the disciples? Mark 9:31, 32.

  13. What attitude of the disciples led Jesus to ask them an
embarrassing question, and what did they answer? Matt. 9:33, 34.

   14. What basic principle of Christian ministry does Jesus set
forth? Mark 9:35-37; Matt. 16:24.

                                       [8 )
                       The. Storm on the Lake
   1. After Jesus had fed the multitude, what did He bid the
disciples do, and where did He go? Matt. 14:21-23.

   2. Through what experience were the disciples passing while
Jesus was absent from them? Matt. 14:24.

  3. In what miraculous way did Jesus return to His disciples,
and how were they affected? Matt. 14:25, 26.

   4. What comforting word did Jesus speak to His disciples? How
did Peter's impulsive nature respond? Matt. 14:27, 28.

   5. What did Jesus' bidding enable Peter to do? Matt. 14:29.

   6. What was the cause of Peter's failure? Matt. 14:30, first part.

   NoTE.—"Looking unto Jesus, Peter walks securely; but as in self-satisfac-
tion he glances back toward his companions in the boat, his eyes are turned
from the Saviour. The wind is boisterous. The waves roll high, and come
directly between him and the Master; and he is afraid. For a moment
Christ is hidden from his view, and his faith gives way. He begins to sink.
But while the billows talk with death, Peter lifts his eyes from the angry
waters, and fixing them upon. Jesus, cries, 'Lord, save me.' "—The Desire of
Ages, page 381.
  7. How did Jesus respond to Peter's despairing cry for help?
Matt. 14:31.
   NOTE.—"Jesus read the character of His disciples. He knew how sorely
their faith was to be tried. In this incident on the sea He desired to reveal
to Peter his own weakness,—to show that his safety was in constant depend-
ence upon divine power. Amid the storms of temptation he could walk
safely only as in utter self-distrust he should rely upon the Saviour."—The
Desire of Ages, page 382.
                             Testing Truths
   8. What important truth did Jesus set forth at Capernaum the
day following the feeding of the five thousand? John 6:22-26, 31-
35, 48-51, 58.

   9. How did the multitude react to this wonderful discourse?
   ANSWER: There was (a) Discussion         John 6:28, 30, 31
                       (b) Dissatisfaction          Verses 41, 42
                       (c) Disagreement             Verse 52.
                       (d) Desertion                Verses 60, 61, 66
                                     [9 ]
   10. What did many of the disciples do at that time? John 6:66.

   11. What question did Jesus put to the Twelve? How did Peter
reply? John 6:67-69.

    NOTE.—" 'To whom shall we go?' Not from the teaching of Christ, His
lessons of love and mercy, to the darkness of unbelief, the wickedness of the
world. While the Saviour was forsaken by many who had witnessed His
wonderful works, Peter expressed the faith of the disciples,—Thou art that
Christ.' The very thought of losing this anchor of their souls filled them
with fear and pain. To be destitute of a Saviour was to be adrift on a dark
and stormy sea."—The Desire of Ages, page 393.
   12. What should be our attitude when we, like Peter, may be
tempted to draw away from the Saviour? Heb. 10:23, 35-39.

    NOTE.—"Those who fail to realize their constant dependence upon God
will be overcome by temptation. We may now suppose that our feet stand
secure, and that we shall never be moved. We may say with confidence, I
know in whom I have believed; nothing can shake my faith in God and in
His word. But Satan is planning to take advantage of our hereditary and
cultivated traits of character, and to blind our eyes to our own necessities
and defects. Only through realizing our own weakness and looking stead-
fastly unto Jesus can we walk securely."—The Desire o f Ages, page 382.

66-72.

                           Peter Denies His Lord

   1. What is the cause of Peter's and every other Christian's
shameful betrayal of our blessed Lord? Luke 22:45, 46.
                                10
    Nom.—"It was in sleeping when Jesus bade him watch and pray that
Peter had prepared the way for his great sin. All the disciples, by sleeping
in that critical hour, sustained a great loss. Christ knew the fiery ordeal
through which they were to pass. He knew how Satan would work to para-
lyze their senses that they might be unready for the trial. Therefore it was
that He gave them warning. Had those hours in the garden been spent in
watching and prayer, Peter would not have been left to depend upon his
own feeble strength."—The Desire of Ages, page 713.
   2. How did Peter and the disciples act when Jesus was arrested
in the garden? Mark 14:50.

  3. When Peter, through failing to pray, lost his vital hold upon
God, how did he follow his Lord and Master? Mark 14:54.

  4. How did Peter further attempt to conceal his connection
with Christ? John 18:16, 18; Mark 14:66, 67; Luke 22:55.

   NOTE.—"Peter tried to show no interest in the trial of his Master, but
his heart was wrung with sorrow as he heard the cruel taunts, and saw the
abuse He was suffering. More than this, he was surprised and angry that
Jesus should humiliate Himself and His followers by submitting to such
treatment. In order to conceal his true feelings, he endeavored to join with
the persecutors of Jesus in their untimely jests. But his appearance was
unnatural. He was acting a lie, and while seeking to talk unconcernedly he
could not restrain expressions of indignation at the abuse heaped upon his
Master."—The Desire of Ages, page 712.
   5. When asked if he were one of Christ's followers, what did
Peter say? Luke 22:56-58; Mark 14:68.

   6. To what further depths did Peter fall as a result of following
his Lord afar off, and denying Him? Mark 14:71; Matt. 26:73, 74.

                  The Lord's Look of Compassion
   7. How did Peter's denial affect his Lord and Master? Luke
22:61.

   NoTE.—"While the degrading oaths were fresh upon Peter's lips, and the
shrill crowing of the cock was still ringing in his ears, the Saviour turned
from the frowning judges, and looked full upon His poor disciple. At the same
time Peter's eyes were drawn to his Master. In that gentle countenance he
read deep pity and sorrow, but there was no anger there."—The Desire of
Ages, page 712.
  8. When Peter realized what he had done, how was he affected?
Luke 22:62.
                             [11]
   NOTE.—"The sight of that pale suffering face, those quivering lips, that
look of compassion and forgiveness, pierced his heart like an arrow. Con-
science was aroused. Memory was active. Peter called to mind his promise
of a few short hours before that he would go with his Lord to prison and
to death. He remembered his grief when the Saviour told him in the upper
chamber that he would deny his Lord thrice that same night. Peter had just
declared that he knew not Jesus, but he now realized with bitter grief how
well his Lord knew him, and how accurately He had read his heart, the false-
ness of which was unknown even to himself."—The Desire of Ages, pages
712, 713.
  9. What would have been Peter's fate if Jesus had not inter-
ceded for Him? Luke 22:31, 32.

   NOTE.—"Oh, the grace of those words! `I have prayed for thee,'—not
that he might not fall, but, having fallen, that his faith might not fail, his
confidence might not give way. Nothing can surpass the grace that shines out
here. The blessed One knew all that was to happen—the shameful denial—
the cursing and swearing; and yet, 'I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail
not'—that thy confidence in the eternal stability of My grace may not give
way."—C. H. Mackintosh, Simon Peter, page 64.
                       The Restoration of Peter

   10. Prior to His ascension, what touching question did Jesus
ask Peter, and what commission did He give him indicating that
he had been brought back into full discipleship? John 21:15-19.

     NOTE.—"The first work that Christ entrusted to Peter on restoring him
to the ministry was to feed the lambs. This was a work in which Peter had
little experience. It would require great care and tenderness, much patience
and perseverance. It called him to minister to those who were young in
the faith, to teach the ignorant, to open the Scriptures to them, and to edu-
cate them for usefulness in Christ's service. Heretofore Peter had not been
fitted to do this, or even to understand its importance. But this was the
work which Jesus now called upon him to do. For this work his own
experience of suffering and repentance had prepared him."—The Desire of
Ages, page 812.
   11. In contrast to Peter's denial of Christ, what requirement of
discipleship had Jesus set forth? Matt. 16:24, 25.

   NOTE.—"It seems very wonderful to find on the page of inspiration the
record of the fall of such an eminent servant of Christ as Simon Peter. We,
in our wisdom, would judge it best to draw the curtain of silence over such
an event. Not so the Holy Ghost. He has seen fit to tell us plainly of the
errors, and failures, and sins, of such men as Abraham, Moses, David, Peter,
and Paul, in order that we may learn holy lessons from such records—lessons
of human frailty, lessons of divine grace, lessons full of solemn warning, and
yet of most precious consolation and encouragement. We learn what we
are, and we learn what God is. We learn that we cannot trust ourselves for
                                      [ 12 ]
a single moment; for, if not kept by grace, there is no depth of sin into
which we are not capable of falling; but we learn to trust the eternal stability
of that grace which has dealt with the erring ones and sinning ones of other
days, and to lean with ever-growing confidence on the One who is 'the same
yesterday, today, and forever.' "—C. H. Mackintosh, Simon Peter, page 57.
   12. Why are such experiences recorded in the Scriptures? Rom.
15:4.

    AIM: To inspire us to yield our lives to Christ and to the Holy Spirit.
                           DAILY STUDY ASSIGNMENT
I. General survey of the lesson.         6. Read "The Acts of the Apostles,"
2. Questions 1-3; memorize Acts 3:19.        pages 47-56.
3. Questions 4-6.                        7. Read "The Acts of the Apostles,"
4. Questions 7-9.                            pages 70-76; review the lesson.
5. Questions 10-13.

                A Brief History of Peter's Apostleship
   1. Just before the ascension what promise did Jesus renew to
the apostolic group? Luke 24:49.

   2. In what events in the life of the apostles was this promise sig-
nally fulfilled? Acts 2:1-4, 14-18, 38.

   3. During the experience at Pentecost and the days following,
what evidence do we have that Peter was in earnest about his
restoration to discipleship? Acts 3:12-21.

   NorE.—How may we account for the remarkable change that has come
about in Peter's life? Six weeks earlier than the incidents recorded, in Acts,
chapters 2-5, he was smitten with the cowardice that so disgracefully betrayed
his Master. The answer is Pentecost. How the church needs it today !
   "The Saviour knew that no argument, however logical, would melt hard
hearts, or break through the crust of worldliness and selfishness. He knew
that His disciples must receive the heavenly endowment; that the gospel
would be effective only as it was proclaimed by hearts made warm and lips
made eloquent by a living knowledge of Him who is the way, the truth, and
the life. . . . A vigilant, determined leader was in command of the forces of
                                         [ 13
darkness, and the followers of Christ could battle for the right only through
the help that God, by His Spirit, would give them."—The Acts of the Apos-
tles, page 31.
             A Stalwart Leader in the Early Church

  4. Who appears in the forefront, fighting the battles of the-
Lord during the early crisis of the church? Acts 4:8, 13; 5:29-32.

    NOTE.—"The promise of the Holy Spirit is not limited to any age or to
any race. Christ declared that the divine influence of His Spirit was to be
with His followers unto the end. From the Day of Pentecost to the present
time, the Comforter has been sent to all who have yielded themselves fully
to the Lord and to His service. To all who have accepted Christ as a personal
Saviour, the Holy Spirit has come as a counselor, sanctifier, guide, and wit-
ness. The more closely believers have walked with God, the more clearly
and powerfully have they testified of their Redeemer's love and of His sav-
ing grace."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 49.
   5. In the early development of the church what part did Peter
take? Acts 8:14, 24, 25; 12:1-5, 17.

   Nom—Throughout the first twelve chapters of the book of Acts, the
apostle Peter is frequently mentioned. Chapter 9 speaks of him as the
prominent leader of the Gentile mission. After Peter's arrest in chapter 12
he drops out of sight until the General Council is called in AD. 50. Here
again the apostle Peter takes an active part, and then he disappears from the
scene. The rest of the book of Acts is concerned with the missionary journeys
and ministry of Paul.
  6. What is recorded that would indicate Peter's faith had
become greatly strengthened? Acts 9:31-35, 39-41.

   7. What experience led Peter to understand that the gospel was
not for the Jews only? Acts 10:5, 9, 34.

  8. How does the apostle Paul indicate what Peter's principal
work was?' Gal. 2:7, 8.

   NOTE.—"As time went on, the apostle's influence as an educator and
leader increased; and while he never lost his burden to labor especially for
the Jews, yet he bore his testimony in many lands, and strengthened the faith
of multitudes in the gospel."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 517.

                    Closing Period of Peter's Life
   9. Toward the close of their lives in what city did these two
veteran apostles, Peter and Paul, bear their witness? Compare Acts
28:16, 30 with 1 Peter 5:13.
                                    [ 14 ]
    Nom.—" 'Babylon' of 1 Peter 5:13, is the figurative or symbolical desig-
nation for Rome. The figurative 'Babylon' is used because of the personifica-
tion 'the one elect with you' and because of the figurative term 'my son' as
a designation for Mark. 'Babylon' emphasizes the paganism of Rome, the
great city of the world, all her pagan idolatry and corruption, and also—
quite important—all her hostility to God's elect."—R. C. H. Lenski, Interpre-
tation of Peter, page 232.
    "In the providence of God, Peter was permitted to close his ministry in
Rome, where his imprisonment was ordered by the emperor Nero about the
time of Paul's final arrest. Thus the two veteran apostles, who for many
years had been widely separated in their labors, were to bear their last
witness for Christ in the world's metropolis, and upon its soil to shed their
blood as the seed of a vast harvest of saints and martyrs."—The Acts of the
Apostles, page 537.

   10. What information in Peter's epistle accords with the fact
that he wrote these letters toward the close of his life? 2 Peter
1:13, 14.

    NOTE.—"Throughout his ministry, Peter faithfully watched over the flock
entrusted to his care, and thus proved himself worthy of the charge and
responsibility given him by the Saviour. . . . In the later years of his min-
istry, Peter was inspired to write to the believers 'scattered throughout . . .
Asia.'"—The Acts of the Apostles, pages 516, 517.
  11. What prayer of Jesus was fulfilled in the life of our beloved
apostle? John 17:5, 6, 8, 9, 15, 17.

   12. Sanctified by the truth and prepared for his final work in
the school of adversity, what important mission did Peter fulfill
in the writing of his two epistles? Luke 22:32.

   13. What prophecy of Jesus indicated how Peter was to die?
John 21:18, 19.



                    Lesson 6, for February 9, 1952

             The Elect and Their Inheritance
    LESSON SCRIPTURE: I Peter 1:1-9.
    MEMORY VERSE: "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
which according to His abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by
the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead." 1 Peter 1:3.

                            Peter's Salutation
  1. How does Simon Peter introduce himself to the believers in
Asia Minor? 1 Peter 1:1, first part.

   NOTE.—"He designates himself as an apostle, . . . a technical word used
by one sent from someone else with credentials on a mission. Peter was an
ambassador of Jesus Christ sent by Him with credentials in the form of
miracles, and on a mission, that of proclaiming the good news of salvation."
Kenneth S. Wuest, First Peter in the Greek New Testament, pages 13, 14.
   2. What does Peter call these Christians to whom he is writing?
1 Peter 1:1, second part.

   NorE.—"He writes to them as 'sojourners of the dispersion.' . . . But it
would be a mistake to restrict the word 'dispersion' here to the Jewish con-
verts. The apostle speaks more than once in his letter to those who had never
been Jews . . . (1:14), . . . (2:10), . . . (4:3). . . . They could be verily
only strangers and sojourners; their true home could never be made among
their heathen surroundings. As the Jews in old days sighed for Jerusalem, so
their hope was centered on a Jerusalem above."—The Expositor's Bible,
James, Jude, Peter; First Peter, London, England, 1908, pages 4-6.
   3. In what part of the Roman Empire were these churches
located? 1 Peter 1:1, last part.

    NorE.—"Little mention is made in the bOok of Acts of the later work of
the apostle Peter. During the busy years of ministry that followed the out-
pouring of the Spirit on the Day of Pentecost, he was among those who put
forth untiring efforts to reach the Jews who came to Jerusalem to worship
at the time of the annual festivals.   '
    "As the number of believers multiplied in Jerusalem and in other places
visited by the messengers of the cross, the talents possessed by Peter proved
of untold value to the early Christian church."
    "In the later years of his ministry, Peter was inspired to write to the
believers 'scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and
Bithynia.' His letters were the means of reviving the courage and strength-
ening the faith of those who were enduring trial and affliction."—The Acts of
the Apostles, pages 514, 517.
   4. By what name is the high esteem of these scattered Christians
indicated? 1 Peter 1:2, first part.

    NOTE.—"There is nothing fatalistic or arbitrary about election as taught
in the Scriptures. The gospel is to be preached to all, and all who believe
                                    [ 16 ]
it may be assured that they are numbered among the elect."—H. A. Ironside,
Expository Notes on the Epistles of Peter, page 14.
   5. How had they obtained this honored distinction? 1 Peter
1:2, second part.

   NOTE.—"Here Peter may be his own interpreter. In his sermon on the
Day of Pentecost he employs the same word, 'foreknowledge,' and he is
the only one who uses it in the New Testament. There (Acts 2:23) he says
that Christ was delivered up to be crucified by the determinate counsel and
foreknowledge of God. And on the same subject in this very chapter (1:20)
he speaks of Jesus as foreknown, as a Lamb without spot and blemish before
the foundation of the world. In these passages we are carried back beyond
the ages into the divine council chamber, and we find the whole course of
human history naked and open before the eyes of the All-seeing. God knew
even then what the history of the human race would be, saw that sin would
find an entrance into the world, and that a sacrifice would be needed, if
sinners were to be redeemed."—The Expositor's Bible, James, Jude, Peter;
First Peter, page 8.
   6. How does the apostle close his brief but comprehensive sal-
utation? 1 Peter 1:2, third part.

  NOTE.—"Charis (grace) in classical Greek referred to a favor conferred
freely, with no expectation of return, and finding its only motive in the
bounty and freeheartedness of the giver. This favor was always done to a
friend, never to an enemy. Right here charis leaps forward an infinite dis-
tance, for the Lord Jesus died for His enemies (Romans 5:8-10), a thing
unheard of in the human race. Surely this was beyond the ordinary course
of what might be expected and is therefore commendable." "God stepped
down from His judgment seat and took upon Himself at Calvary's cross, the
guilt and penalty of human sin, thus satisfying His justice and making pos-
sible the bestowal of His mercy. And this He did, not for those who were
His friends, but His bitter enemies, unlovely creatures saturated with sin."—
Kenneth S. Wuest, Treasures From the Greek New Testament, page 17.
   7. How is the magnanimity, or largeness of mind and heart, of
God seen in the closing words of Peter's salutation? 1 Peter 1:2,
last part. Compare John 14:27.

   NOTE.—"Peace," the result of grace in the heart.
                        The Saints' Inheritance

   8. For what does the apostle express gratitude? 1 Peter 1:3.

   9. Through what means will the "lively hope" become a reality?
1 Peter 1:3. Compare Rom. 1:4; Phil. 3:10, 11; 1 Thess. 4:16, 17.

   10. What is the "lively hope" (living hope) cherished by the
followers of Christ? 1 Peter 1:4; John 14:1-3; Titus 2:13.
                                [ 17]
    NOTE.—"How beggared earthly speech appears when we essay by it to pic-
ture the glory that shall be revealed for us! . . . What it will be we cannot
express. We only know some evils from which it will be free. It shall be
incorruptible, like the God and Father (Romans 1:23) who bestows it.
Eternal, it shall contain within it no seed of decay, nothing which can cause
it to perish. . . . It shall be undefiled, for we are to , share it with our
Elder Brother, our High Priest (Hebrews 7:26), who is now made higher
than the heavens."—The Expositor's Bible, James, Jude, Peter; First Peter,
page 20.
                           The Value of Trials

  11. By what are the believers kept while they await the "blessed
hope"? 1 Peter 1:5-7. Compare Heb. 7:25; 12:4-8, 11.

    NOTE.-"But, thanks and praise to our God, the enemy cannot prevail.
`Hitherto shalt thou come, and no further.' The all-prevailing intercession of
our divine Advocate sustains the faith so sorely tried, carries the soul through
the deep and dark waters, restores the broken link of communion, heals the
spiritual wounds, lifts up the fallen one, brings back the wanderer, and fills
the heart with praise and thanksgiving. 'I have prayed for thee that thy
faith fail not; and when thou art restored, strengthen thy brethren.' "—C. H.
Mackintosh, Simon Peter, page 68.
    Peter must have recalled the trial of his faith and the remarkable way
in which his Master brought him through. Now he assures his readers of the
preciousness of their faith, and pleads that the trials before them will only
purify and enrich it and preserve it to the glory and honor of their Master at
His coming.
  12. How does Peter account for the unspeakable joy which
possessed these Christians in Asia Minor? 1 Peter 1:8.

   13. What will be the reward of genuine faith in Jesus? 1 Peter
1:9. Compare 1 John 5:4; Heb. 11:1, 39, 40.

    Note.—"`Great is the reward in heaven' of those who are witnesses for
Christ through persecution and reproach. While the people are looking for
earthly good, Jesus points them to a heavenly reward. But He does not place
it all in the future life; it begins here. The Lord appeared of old time to
Abraham, and said, am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.' This
is the reward of all who follow Christ. Jehovah Immanuel—He 'in whom
are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge,' in whom dwells 'all the
fullness of the Godhead bodily'—to be brought into sympathy with Him, to
know Him, to possess Him, as the heart opens more and more to receive His
attributes; to know His love and power, to possess the unsearchable riches of
Christ, to comprehend more and more 'what is the breadth, and length, and
depth, and height; and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge,
that ye might be filled with all the fullness of God,'—`this is the heritage of
the servants of the Lord, and their righteousness is of Me, saith the Lord.' "
—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, page 57.

                     The Gospel in Prophecy
    LESSON SCRIPTURE: 1 Peter 1:10-12.
    MEMORY VERSE: "Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none
other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved." Acts 4:12.
    STUDY HELPS: "The Desire of Ages," pages 234, 235; "Thoughts From the
Mount of Blessing," pages 67-72; "Patriarchs and Prophets," pages 366, 367; "Proph-
ets and Kings," pages 730-732.
    AIM: To impress us with the urgency of a deeper study of the gospel of our salva-

4. Questions 7-9.                                 Blessing;" review the lesson.
5. Questions 10-14.

                       The Theme of the Prophets
   1. What interest did the prophets of old manifest in the plan of
redemption? 1 Peter 1:10, first part.

   2. What was the central theme of the Old Testament prophets?
1 Peter 1:10, second part.

  3. For what great facts in the plan of salvation were these
ancient prophets so diligently searching? 1 Peter 1:11, first part.

   NOM—They were first concerned with the fact of Christ's suffering.
Isaiah 53 is perhaps the most vivid illustration of that fact. But notice also
that Peter says they were deeply interested in "what manner of time" Christ
should suffer. "In the preceding verses of the chapter the thoughts of the
apostle have been dwelling on the future, on the time when the hope of the
believer shall attain its fruition, and faith shall be lost in sight. He now
turns his glance backward to notice how the promise of salvation has been
the subject of revelation through all time."—The Expositor's Bible, James,
Jude, Peter; First Peter, London, England, 1908, page 30.
   4. What did the apostle Peter say would follow Christ's suffer-
ings? 1 Peter 1:11, last part.

   NOTE.—In the last clause of verse 10, Peter speaks "of the grace that
should come unto you," and in the last clause of the eleventh verse he speaks
of "the glory that should follow." The glory that issues forth from the cross
of Christ is twofold. First, let us never forget that during the age of Im-
perial Rome one could travel from the Euphrates to the Atlantic and find
not a single monument to acts of mercy or kindliness. There were plenty of
monuments to the strength of the Caesars, to the might of the empire, and
                                        [ 19 ]
to the vindictive wrath of the emperors; but it was reserved for the glory of
the cross and the influence of Jesus to bring to our civilization the institu-
tions of mercy that now belt the earth. Hospitals, asylums, sanitariums, Red
Cross organizations, Community Chest, organized charity of all kinds, are
Christian reactions against the severity of the age in which Christ was born.
Secondly, the glory of the cross in the future of Christ's kingdom may be
seen best by reading the following scriptures: Romans 8:18; Ephesians 1:
10-14; Isaiah 65:17-19; Revelation 21; 22.
   5. What significant fact was revealed to the prophets of old?
1 Peter 1:12, first part.

   NorE.—"The prophets to whom these great scenes were revealed longed
to understand their full import. They 'inquired and searched diligently: . . .
searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in
them did signify. . . . Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves,
but unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you.'
   "To us who are standing on the very verge of their fulfillment, of what
deep moment, what living interest, are these delineations of the things to
come,—events for which, since our first parents turned their steps from
Eden, God's children have watched and waited, longed and prayed!"—
Prophets and Kings, page 731.
   6. How did Peter assure the believers to whom he wrote that
the message declared to them was inspired? 1 Peter 1:12, second
part. Compare Acts 1:8; 5:32.

    NorE.—Peter declared that the gospel had been preached to them by "the
Holy Ghost sent down from heaven." "The Spirit was to be given as a
regenerating agent, and without this the sacrifice of Christ would have been
of no avail. The power of evil had been strengthening for centuries, and the
submission of men to this satanic captivity was amazing. Sin could be
resisted and overcome only through the mighty agency of the Third Person
of the Godhead, who would come with no modified energy, but in the fullness
of divine power."—The Desire of Ages, page 671.

                        The Ministry of Angels

   7. In what terse yet striking way does Peter introduce the inter-
est of the angels in the plan of salvation? 1 Peter 1:12, last part.

    NOTE.—"There are mysteries in the plan of redemption—the humiliation
of the Son of God, that He might be found in fashion as a man, the wonder-
ful love and condescension of the Father in yielding up His Son—that are to
the heavenly angels subjects of continual amazement."—Testimonies, vol. 5,
p. 702.
    "The church is the teacher of the angels. Paul says that the apostles 'are
made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men' (1 Cor. 4:9).
How the angels watch the saints. How they wonder at creatures once totally
depraved, now living holy lives that glorify God. It is in the church that
they catch the supreme view of God's love, sinners saved by grace, raised to
                                     20
a seat in heavenly places in Christ. The church is God's university for angels.
The verse reads, 'To the intent that now to the principalities and powers in
heavenly places might be made known by means of the instrumentality of the
church, the manifold wisdom of God.' "—Kenneth S. Wuest, First Peter in
the Greek New Testament, page 32.
   8. How is the special work of the angels defined? Heb. 1:13, 14.

   9. What promise of angelic protection has God made to all
them that fear Him? Ps. 34:7.
   10. How was this promise realized in the days of Elisha?
2 Kings 6:13-17.

   11. What experiences in the time of Daniel indicate that God
protects His children from physical danger through the interven-
tion of angels? Dan. 3:28; 6:22.

   1.2. What evidence of angel guardianship was brought to light
in Jesus' experience in Gethsemane? Luke 22:43; Matt. 26:53.

   13. Following Pentecost, how was angel ministry manifest in
the lives of Peter and his associates? Acts 12:5-11; 5:18, 19.

   14. At the second coming of Christ what important task will
be performed by the angels? Matt. 24:30, 31.
    NOTE.—"So, in all ages, angels have been near to Christ's faithful fol-
lowers. The vast confederacy of evil is arrayed against all who would over-
come; but Christ would have us look to the things which are not seen, to
the armies of heaven encamped about all who love God, to deliver them.
From what dangers, seen and unseen, we have been preserved through the
interposition of the angels, we shall never know, until in the light of eternity
we see the providences of God. Then we shall know that the whole family
of heaven was interested in the family here below, and that messengers from
the throne of God attended our steps from day to day."—The Desire of Ages,
page 240.

    ject Lessons" assignment.

                      An Exhortation to Holiness

  1. What figure does the apostle Peter use in referring to the
control of the mind? 1 Peter 1:13, first part.
   NoTE.—"The apostle sought to teach the believers how important it is to
keep the mind from wandering to forbidden themes, or from spending its
energies on trifling subjects. Those who would not fall a prey to Satan's
devices, must guard well the avenues of the soul; they must avoid reading;
seeing, or hearing that which will suggest impure thoughts. The mind must
not be left to dwell at random upon every subject that the enemy of souls
may suggest."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 518.
   2. What two qualities should characterize the lives of the
believers? 1 Peter 1:13, second part.
    NoTE.—"The first one is, 'be sober' The Greek word means, 'to be calm
and collected in spirit, to be temperate, dispassionate, circumspect.' It speaks
of the proper exercise of the mind, that state of mind in which the individual
is self-controlled, and is able to see things without the distortion caused by
worry, fear, and their related attitudes."—Kenneth S. Wuest, First Peter in
the Greek New Testament, pages 35, 36.
   3. To whom does Peter compare God's chosen ones? 1 Peter
1:14, first part.
    NOTE.—"As children inherit the nature of their parents, so a child of God
is made a partaker of the divine nature, which nature always impels to the
act of obedience. It is natural for a child of God to obey Him."—Kenneth
S. Wuest, First Peter in the Greek New Testament, pages 36, 37.
                          An Exalted Standard

   4. What are they admonished not to do? 1 Peter 1:14, second
part.
    NoTE.—"In our characters as obedient children of God, we are exhorted
not to fashion ourselves with respect to our former lusts. The word 'fashion'
in the Greek text refers to the act of assuming an outward appearance pat-
terned after some certain thing, an appearance or expression which does not
come from and is not representative of one's inmost and true nature."—
Kenneth S. Wuest, First Peter in the Greek New Testament, page 37.
   5. What exalted standard does Peter now set forth as the Chris-
tian's goal? 1 Peter 1:15, 16.
     NOTE.—"God has commanded us, 'Be ye holy; for I am holy;' and an
                                       22
inspired apostle declares that without holiness 'no man shall see the Lord.'
Holiness is agreement with God. By sin the image of God in man has been
marred and well-nigh obliterated; it is the work of the gospel to restore that
which has been lost; and we are to co-operate with the divine agency in this
work. And how can we come into harmony with God, how shall we receive
His likeness, unless we obtain a knowledge of Him? It is this knowledge that
Christ came into the world to reveal unto us."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 743.
   6. What is said regarding the equality of God's judgment?
1 Peter 1:17.
    NorE.—"The word 'sojourning' [in verse 17] is from a word meaning
literally 'to have a home alongside of,' and refers to a person living in a
foreign land alongside of people who are not of his kind. Here it refers to
children of God living far from their heavenly home, in foreign territory, on
a planet that has a usurper, Satan, as reigning monarch, the people of which
are his subjects. The Christian must always live in the consciousness of the
fact that he is being watched by the unsaved, that his responsibility is to bear
a clear, ringing, genuine testimony to his God and Saviour by the kind of
life he lives."—Kenneth S. Wuest, First Peter in the Greek New Testament,
page 41.
                        Price of Our Redemption

   7. What things highly esteemed of men are valueless in pro-
curing our redemption? 1 Peter 1:18, first part.
   NOTE.—The "word translated 'redeemed' means 'to release or liberate by
payment of a ransom.' . . . We are free men, freed from the guilt, penalty,
and the power of sin, some day to be freed from the presence of sin. We
are liberated from all that, so that we might realize in our lives that for
which we were created, namely, to glorify God."—Kenneth S. Wuest, Treas-
ures in the Greek New Testament, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company,
page 52.
   8. From what has the Christian been delivered? 1 Peter 1:18,
second part.
   NoTE.—The words "vain conversation received by tradition" are more
accurately rendered in the Revised Version "vain manner of life handed
down."
   9. How does Peter describe the infinite cost of our redemption?
1 Peter 1:19.
    NOTE.—"Had silver and gold been sufficient to purchase the salvation of
men, how easily might it have been accomplished by Him who says, 'The
silver is Mine, and the gold is Mine.' But only by the precious blood of the
Son of God could the transgressor be redeemed. The plan of salvation was
laid in sacrifice."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 519.
       Inception and Confirmation of Plan of Redemption

   10. When was the plan of redemption ordained by God? 1 Peter
1:20, first part.
                              [23 ]
   11. When and how was the mystery of salvation more fully
revealed? 1 Peter 1:20, second part. Compare Col. 1:26, 27; Gal.
4:4, 5; Heb. 9:26.

   12. How is our belief in God confirmed? 1 Peter 1:21. Com-
pare Rom. 1:4; 1 Cor. 15:12-23.

ble, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever." I Peter 1 :23.

    "Steps to Christ."

                        A New Heart Experience
  1. What transformation of character will be effected by obedi-
ence to the truth of God? 1 Peter 1:22, first part.

    NOTE.—"With the word of God in hand we may draw nearer, step by step,
in consecrated love to Jesus. As the Spirit of God becomes better known, the
Bible will be accepted as the only foundation of faith. God's people will
receive the word as the leaves of the tree of life, more precious than fine gold
purified in the fire, and more powerful to sanctify than any other agency."—
Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 193.
   2. What divine gift has God bestowed upon His children that
they might have the inner strength to obey His word? Ezek.
36:26, 27; John 3:5, 6.

   NoTE.—"It is the Spirit that makes effectual what has been wrought out
by the world's Redeemer. It is by the Spirit that the heart is made pure.
Through the Spirit the believer becomes a partaker of the divine nature.
Christ has given His Spirit as a divine power to overcome all hereditary and
cultivated tendencies to evil, and to impress His own character upon His
church."—The Desire of Ages, page 671.
                                      [24 7
  3. Upon whom did the apostle Peter say the gift of the Holy
Spirit would be bestowed? Acts 5:32.

   Nora.—"Obedience is the test of discipleship. It is the keeping of the
commandments that proves the sincerity of our professions of love. When
the doctrine we accept kills sin in the heart, purifies the soul from defile-
ment, bears fruit unto holiness, we may know that it is the truth of God.
When benevolence, kindness, tenderheartedness, sympathy, are manifest
in our lives; when the joy of rightdoing is in our hearts; when we exalt
Christ, and not self, we may know that our faith is of the right order.
`Hereby we do know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments.'"—
Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, page 210.

                    The Fruitage of the New Life

   4. What is the test of genuine conversion? 1 Peter 1:22, second
part.

  5. What is Peter's final exhortation concerning our love for
one another? 1 Peter 1:22, third part.

   6. How only can Christians love one another with a pure heart
fervently? 1 Peter 1:23, first part.

    NOTE.—"The exhortation is to love one's brother Christian because he is
precious to God, and to love him with a love that is willing to sacrifice one's
self for the benefit of that brother, a love that causes one to be long-suffering
toward him, a love that makes one treat him kindly, a love that so causes
one to rejoice in the welfare of another that there is no room for envy in
the heart, a love that is not jealous, a love that keeps one from boasting of
one's self, a love that keeps one from bearing one's self in a lofty manner, a
love that keeps one from acting unbecomingly, a love that keeps one from
seeking one's own rights, a love that keeps one from becoming angry, a love
that does not impute evil, a love that does not rejoice in iniquity but in the
truth, a love that bears up against all things. . . . That is the kind of love
which God says one Christian should have for another."—Kenneth S. Wuest,
First Peter in the Greek New Testament, pages 47, 48.

                 The Word of God in the New Birth

   7. From what kind of seed does such a new birth come? 1 Peter
1:23, second part.

   NoTE.—"The word of God is the seed. Every seed has in itself a ger-
minating principle. In it the life of the plant is enfolded. So there is life in
God's word. Christ says, 'The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit,
and they are life.' He that heareth My word, and believeth on Him that
sent Me, hath everlasting life.' In every command and in every promise
                                       25
of the word of God is the power, the very life of God, by which the com-
mand may be fulfilled and the promise realized. He who by faith receives
the word is receiving the very life and character of God."—Christ's Object
Lessons, page 38.
    8. What eternal qualities does Peter attach to the word of God
in this Scripture? 1 Peter 1:23, last part. Compare Heb. 4:12, 13.

    Nora.—"When truth becomes an abiding principle in the life, the soul is
`born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of
God, which liveth and abideth forever.' This new birth is the result of
receiving Christ as the Word of God. When by the Holy Spirit divine truths
are impressed upon the heart, new conceptions are awakened, and the ener-
gies hitherto dormant are aroused to co-operate with God."—The Acts of
the Apostles, page 520.
                    The Secret of a Fruitful Life
   9. What supreme privilege is ours when we have experienced
a genuine new birth? Acts 2:38; John 14:16-18; Rev. 3:20.

  10. What is God's pleasure concerning His children in whom
He now dwells? John 15:8.

    11. What kind of fruit will be borne by the Christian who is
filled with the Spirit? Phil. 1:11; Gal. 5:22; Col. 3:12-16.

   12. How did Jesus illustrate this blessed partnership we have
with Him through the Spirit in life and service? John 15:4, 5.

    NoTE.—The effectual working of the Holy Spirit in the life of the believer
has ever been a mystery to most of God's children. But in John 15, Jesus
taught this fundamental truth by the picture method. It is important to
observe that the fruit never grows on the vine, it grows only on the branches.
Jesus produces the fruit, but in this divine partnership He has chosen to let
it grow on the branches. He produces the fruit, and we distribute it to those
who are in such sore need of it. Philippians 2:13. This was the secret of
Paul's ministry as stated in Galatians 2:20. "No longer I," with my failures;
"but Christ" with limitless resources, knowledge, power, patience, love, skill,
all I lack and all I need, all these in Him, and He in me. The art of Christian
living is to give Him unlimited freedom to exercise His faithfulness in us.
    13. After stressing the durability and eternity of the Christian
life, how does Peter contrast the insignificance and frailty of man's
life apart from God? 1 Peter 1:24. Compare Isa. 40:7, 8.

   14. With what assurance does Peter close his presentation of
the new birth? 1 Peter 1:25. Compare John 1:1, 14.
                                    [ 26 ]
                      Lesson 10, for March 8, 1952
                   The Priesthood of Believers
    LESSON SCRIPTURE: 1 Peter 2:1-10.
    MEMORY VERSE: "But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy
nation, a peculiar people; that ye should show forth the praises of Him who hath called
you out of darkness into His marvelous light." 1 Peter 2:9.
    STUDY HELPS: "Steps to Christ," chapter 8; "The Acts of the Apostles,"
pages 593-602; "The Desire of Ages," pages 597-600.
    AIM: To reveal the divine purpose in our conversion—that we may reflect the life
and character of 'Christ.

                                            signment; review the lesson.

                                 Spiritual Food
    1. When the new birth experience is genuine, what effect will
it have in the Christian's life? 1 Peter 2:1.

   NOTE.—" 'Wherefore' goes back to the fact of the new life imparted (1:23),
and argues in 2:1-3 that therefore a new kind of experience is demanded of
the believer. 'Laying aside' is from a participle that has imperative force. In
view of the fact that divine life has been imparted to the believer, it is im-
perative that he 'put away once for all' any sins that may be in his life."—
Kenneth S. Wuest, First Peter in the Greek New Testament, page 50.
   2. What will follow the putting away of sin from the life?
1 Peter 2:2.

   NOTE.—The word "milk" as used here, does not necessarily refer to that
part of the word of God which is in contrast to the meat or solid food of
the word as in Hebrews 5:13, 14, but to the word of God in general.
   3. How does Peter indicate that this desire is awakened? 1 Pe-
ter 2:3.

                              Spiritual Privileges
   4. What illustration does the apostle use to indicate the endur-
ing strength of Christ? 1 Peter 2:4. Compare Ps. 61:2; 89:26; 1 Cor.
10:4.

   5. What figure does Peter use to show the spiritual transforma-
tion in the believer's life through grace? 1 Peter 2:5, first part.
                                         [ 27 ]
    NOTE.—" 'Living stones.' The same title is thus given to believers as to
their Master, through whose transforming grace they, in union with Him,
become like Him, 'living stones.' They were formerly 'dead in trespasses and
sins,' a mass of inert rock; now they are at once alive and strong."—Wm.
H. Griffith Thomas, The Apostle Peter, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Com-
pany, page 181.
   6. What does Christ choose to do with these "living stones"?
1 Peter 2:5, second part.

   NOTE.—"1. Spiritual position: v. 5, 'House' (1 Cor. 3:16 ; Heb. 3:6). All
believers together are regarded as the house of God.
   "2. Spiritual purpose: v. .5, 'Priesthood.' This also refers to the church
as a whole. . . .
   "3. Spiritual privilege: v. 5, 'Sacrifices' (Rom. 12:1; Phil. 4:18; Heb.
13:15, 16). New Testament sacrifices are always 'spiritual,' and include the
sacrifice of ourselves, our gifts, and our praises.
   "4. Spiritual possibility: v. 5, 'Acceptable to God, through Jesus Christ.'
Consider the glory of being able so to live and serve as to be acceptable to
God. This shows what divine grace can do."—Wm. H. Griffith Thomas, The
Apostle Peter, page 182.

                        The Chief Cornerstone
   7. To what Scriptural truth does Peter next refer, and what
promise is made to the believer? 1 Peter 2:6.

   NOTE.—" 'He that believeth on Him shall not be put to shame.' (Isa.
28:16; 8:14. Compare Rom. 9:33 ; Eph. 2:20.) It is because our Lord is
God's foundation that we are invited to believe on Him, and assured that
we shall not be put to shame. Believing is a complex act and attitude of the
soul whereby we (1) approach, (2) rest, (3) abide. And the more we respond
to God's invitation the stronger will be our confidence in the great Rock
foundation of God's eternal love and grace."—Wm. H. Griffith Thomas, The
Apostle Peter, page 183.
  8. What word did Peter use to express how much Jesus really
means to all who believe? 1 Peter 2:7, first part.

   NOTE.—"In 1 Peter 2:7, the Greek has it, 'Unto you who believe, is the
preciousness.' That is, the preciousness of Jesus is imputed to us. He becomes
our preciousness in the eyes of the Father as He becomes our righteousness
before the law. The Son dwells in the bosom of the Father, closest to the
Father's affections. Marvelous grace, that we sinners saved by grace are
brought into that favored place closest to the Father's affections. The Father
loves us as much as He loves His only-begotten Son. What a pillow on
which to rest our weary hearts when going through a testing time."—Kenneth
S. Wuest, Nuggets, pages 15, 16.
  9. What does this Stone which is "disallowed" by the builders
become to those who disbelieve? 1 Peter 2:7 (second part), 8.
                                    [ 28 ]
    NoTE.—The Expositor's Greek Testament offers the following: "The
`precious'-ness of the stone is for you who believe, but for the unbelievers it
is . . . 'a stone of stumbling.' "

                           A Royal Priesthood
  10. What are God's chosen people called? 1 Peter 2:9, first
part. (Margin, a "purchased people.")

    NoTE.—"The Lord hath set apart him that is godly for Himself; this con-
secration to God and separation from the world is plainly and positively
enjoined in both the Old and the New Testament. There is a wall of separa-
tion which the Lord Himself has established between the things of the world
and the things He has chosen out of the world and sanctified unto Himself.
The calling and character of God's people are peculiar, their prospects are
peculiar, and these peculiarities distinguish them from all other people. All
of God's people upon the earth are one body, from the beginning to the end
of time. They have one Head that directs and governs the body. The same
injunctions that rested upon ancient Israel, rest upon God's people now, to
be separate from the world."—Testimonies, vol. 1, p. 283.
  11. What is the peculiar privilege and responsibility of God's
people? 1 Peter 2:9, second part. Compare Isa. 43:21.

   NoTE.—"Christ is waiting with longing desire for the manifestation of
Himself in His church. When the character of Christ shall be perfectly repro-
duced in His people, then He will come to claim them as His own."—Christ's
Object Lessons, page 69.
  12. How completely has their relationship to Christ been
changed? 1 Peter 2:10. Compare Hosea 1:10.

   NOTE.—"We see what God has done for . . . [us]: 'once a non-people,'
not a people in any sense, nothing but sheep without a shepherd; 'now God's
people,' the extreme opposite. All who are far from God are a non-people
spiritually; only those who come to Christ (v. 4) are a real people, God's
people, He being their King, Saviour, Protector, Provider, Benefactor."—R.
C. H. Lenski, Commentary on Peter, page 104.

                         A Spiritual Habitation
   13. According to the apostle Paul, how does God relate Him-
self to this new household of faith? Eph. 2:18-22.

   14. How fully does the gospel restore the fellowship with God
that man had in the Garden of Eden before sin entered? 2 Cor.
6:16-18.
    NOTE.—"The religion of Christ means more than the forgiveness of sin;
it means taking away our sins, and filling the vacuum with the graces of the
                                     [ 29 ]
Holy Spirit. It means divine illumination, rejoicing in God. It means a heart
emptied of self, and blessed with the abiding presence of Christ. When Christ
reigns in the soul, there is purity, freedom from sin. The glory, the fullness,
the completeness of the gospel plan is fulfilled in the life. The acceptance of
the Saviour brings a glow of perfect peace, perfect love, perfect assurance.
The beauty and fragrance of the character of Christ, revealed in the life,
testifies that God has indeed sent His Son into the world to be its Saviour."
—Christ's Object Lessons, pages 419, 420.



                     Lesson 11, for March 15, 1952

             The Deportment of the Christian
    LESSON SCRIPTURE: 1 Peter 2:11-17.
    MEMORY VERSE: "Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, ab-
stain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul." 1 Peter 2:11.
    STUDY HELPS: "Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing," pages 17-72;
"Christ's Object Lessons," pages 325-365; "The Desire of Ages," pages 298-314.
    AIM: To show that a consistent Christian life is the strongest argument in favor
of Christianity.
                           DAILY STUDY ASSIGNMENT
1. General survey of the lesson.                      from "Mount of Bless,ing" as-

5. Questions 10-12; read selections                   ment.

                        An Appeal to Holy Living

   1. What words indicate the apostle Peter's loving interest in
these Christians to whom he is writing? 1 Peter 2:11, first part.

   2. From what does Peter beseech these Christians to abstain?
1 Peter 2:11, second part.

    NOTE.—"Every practice that weakens physical or mental strength unfits
man for the service of his Creator. . . .
   "Peter says, 'Abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul.' Every
sinful gratification tends to benumb the faculties and deaden the mental and
spiritual perceptions, and the word or the Spirit of God can make but a feeble
impression upon the heart."—The Great Controversy, pages 473, 474.
  3. What manner of life does he urge the Christians to practice
among the Gentiles? 1 Peter 2:12, first part.

   NoTE.—"The word 'honest' is the translation of a Greek word that speaks
of goodness which is beautiful, an outer goodness, that strikes the eye. . . .
                                        [ 30 ]
Our manner of life is honest when our lives are in accordance with what we
are inwardly—cleansed, regenerated children of God."—Kenneth S. Wuest,
First Peter in the Greek New Testament, page 59.
  4. When Christians are falsely charged as being evildoers, how
may they answer such accusations? 1 Peter 2:12, second part.

    NoTE.—"The words 'speak against' are literally 'speak down,' referring to
the act of adversely criticizing a person. The separated life of the Christian
is one of the most powerful means God has of convicting the world of its sin.
The world does not like its sin uncovered, hence the persecution which it
directs against the separated Christian. How the people of the world watch
the Christian."—Kenneth S. Wuest, First Peter in the Greek New Testament,
page 60.
                        Relation to Civil Powers

    5. What should be the Christian's attitude toward the civil laws
of the land wherein he lives? 1 Peter 2:13, 14. Compare Acts 5:29.

   NoTE.—"As loyal subjects of the state, Christians are to be obedient to
the laws passed, even though they may feel that in some instances they are
unnecessarily arbitrary and even actually unjust. By their submission they
honor Him whom they recognize as their Lord and Saviour. Whatever form
of government may prevail, so long as it is recognized as the constituted
authority of the country, we are to be in subjection, whether to the king or
by whatever name the supreme executive is known."—Harry Ironside, Exposi-
tory Notes on the Epistles of Peter, pages 31, 32.
   6. On what occasion did the apostle Peter first learn the princi-
ple of obedience to civil authority? Matt. 22:15-22.

    NoTE.—"When the Pharisees heard Christ's answer, 'they marveled, and
left Him, and went their way.' He had rebuked their hypocrisy and presump-
tion, and in doing this He had stated a great principle, a principle that clearly
defines the limits of man's duty to the civil government and his duty to God."
—The Desire of Ages, pages 602, 603.
   7. How does Paul set forth this principle for all? Rom. 13:1-7.

   8. What, however, is our duty when the civil law is contrary
to the law of God? Acts 5:17-20, 28, 29; Dan. 3:14-18.

   9. What will be the result of submission to the laws of the land,
and of good behavior in all of our relations with fellow men?
1 Peter 2:15.

   NoTE.—"We are not required to defy authorities. Our words, whether
spoken or written, should be carefully considered, lest we place ourselves on
record as uttering that which would make us appear antagonistic to law and
                                      [31]
order. We are not to say or do anything that would unnecessarily close up
our way. We are to go forward in Christ's name, advocating the truths
committed to us. If we are forbidden by men to do this work, then we may
say, as did the apostles, 'Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken
unto you more than unto God, judge ye. For we cannot but speak the things
which we have seen and heard.'"—The Acts of the Apostles, page 69.

                      Proper Exercise of Liberty
  10. Since we have been set free from sin, how does the apostle
warn us against misuse of our liberty? 1 Peter 2:16, first part.

   11. In what constructive way are we admonished to use our
liberty? 1 Peter 2:16, second part.

    NoTE.—Since we have been liberated from the bondage of sin, we are to
use our freedom as servants of God, Peter said. "It is the privilege of every
soul to be a living channel through which God can communicate to the world
the treasures of His grace, the unsearchable riches of Christ. . . . There is
nothing that the world needs so much as the manifestation through human-
ity of the Saviour's love. All heaven is waiting for channels through which
can be poured the holy oil to be a joy and blessing to human hearts."—
Christ's Object Lessons, page 419.
   12. With what striking fourfold admonition does the apostle
Peter close this lesson on Christian deportment in social and civil
life? 1 Peter 2:17.

    NOTE.-"1. Humanitarian: 'Honor all men.' Give them that respect and
deference which courtesy or custom demands. Estimate aright what is
involved in true manhood and act accordingly. [The recognition of the right
of every individual to consideration is the obligation of every Christian.] . .
   "2. Christian: 'Love the brotherhood.' This is the special application to
their fellow believers (1 Peter 1:22; 3:8; 4:9; 5:9). It is noteworthy that
whilst we are to honor all men, we are to love Christians.
   "3. Divine: 'Fear God.' (Compare 1 Peter 1:17.) Reverential awe
towards God will necessarily result in submission.
    "4. National: 'Honor the king.' An injunction all the more striking when
we remember that (probably) Nero was on the throne. Loyalty to the
institution is ever to be distinguished from confidence in the person who
occupies the throne. Loyalty necessarily becomes harder if the monarch is
personally unworthy, but though difficult, it is not to be regarded as impos-
sible. (Prov. 24:21; Rom. 13:7)."—Wm. H. Griffith Thomas, The Apostle
Peter, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, pages 195, 196.

                         Our Great Example
    LESSON SCRIPTURE: 1 Peter 2:18-25.
    MEMORY VERSE: "For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suf-
fered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow His steps." 1 Peter 2:21.
    STUDY HELPS: "Early Writings," pages 175-181; "The Desire of Ages," pages
84-92, 698-715, 723-740.
    AIM : To show that all Christians under oppression, persecution, or opposition
should behave in the same manner as their Lord at His trial and crucifixion.
                          DAILY STUDY ASSIGNMENT

5. Questions 11, 12; read "Early Writ-
    ings" assignment.

                Christian Attitude Under Oppression
   1. What counsel does Peter have for Christian servants and
slaves? 1 Peter 2:18.

  2. What kind of behavior on the part of Christians did Peter
consider "thankworthy"? 1 Peter 2:19.

   3. Through what experiences had Peter passed, which enabled
him to instruct these Christians who were continually facing perse-
cution? Acts 4:3, 13, 18, 21; 5:17-20; 12:3, 4.

  4. What merit, if any, is obtained from being patient when
buffeted for wrongdoing? 1 Peter 2:20, first part.

    5. When is patient endurance acceptable? 1 Peter 2:20, second
part.
   6. Unto what experience are Christians called? 1 Peter 2:21,
first part. Compare 2 Tim. 3:12.

    NOTE.—"The divine call of God to a lost sinner is an effectual call unto
salvation, and an accompaniment of that salvation is suffering for righteous-
ness' sake, the natural result of the Christian's contact with the people of
the world and their reaction towards the Lord Jesus who is seen in the life
of the saint. Paul speaks of the same thing when he says, 'For unto you it is
given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on Him, but also to suffer
for His sake.' (Philippians 1:29)."—Kenneth S. Wuest, First Peter in the
Greek New Testament, page 66.
                                        (33 7
                           Christ's Example

   7. What reason does Peter give for this assertion? 1 Peter 2:21,
last part.

   8. Under what circumstances did Jesus set us an example of
patient endurance? Matt. 26:62-67; 27:27-30; Luke 23:34. Com-
pare Isa. 53:7.

    NOTE. "The word 'buffeted' in the Greek text speaks of the act of strik-
ing with the fist. . . . The same word is used in Matthew 26:67, where the
Lord Jesus was pummeled by the frenzied Jewish mob. Isaiah 52:14 gives
us a picture of our Lord after the pummeling which He received at the hands
of the Jews; 'As many were astonied at Thee; His visage was so marred more
than any man, and His form more than the sons of men' The literal render-
ing of this verse according to Hebrew scholars is as follows, 'so marred from
the form of man was His aspect that His appearance was not that of the
Son of man,' namely, not human. This passage bears the marks of Peter's
memories of the awful sight."—Kenneth S. Wuest, First Peter in the Greek
New Testament, pages 65, 66.
   9. How does Peter describe the attitude and conduct of Jesus
during His trial and sufferings? 1 Peter 2:22, 23, first part. Com-
pare Isa. 53:1-12.
                                                                    •
   10. How was Jesus able thus to endure? 1 Peter 2:23, last part.

   NoTE.—"The word 'committed' is the translation of a Greek word which
means literally, 'to hand over.' It means 'to deliver something to someone to
keep, use, take care of, manage.' Our Lord kept on delivering over to God
the Father both the revilers and their revilings as both kept on wounding
His loving heart. It is for us to do the same thing when men revile us be-
cause of our Christian testimony."—Kenneth S. Wuest, First Peter in the
Greek New Testament, page 68.

                         Healed by His Stripes

  11. In what way did Jesus break the power of sin in our lives
and heal the wounded soul? 1 Peter 2:24.

    NOTE.—"There stood the Son of God, wearing the robe of mockery and
the crown of thorns. Stripped to the waist, His back showed the long, cruel
stripes, from which the blood flowed freely. His face was stained with blood,
and bore the marks of exhaustion and pain; but never had it appeared more
beautiful than now. . . . Every feature expressed gentleness and resignation
and the tenderest pity for His cruel foes."—The Desire of Ages, page 735.
   12. What glorious and eternal result has come from the atoning
death of our blessed Saviour? 1 Peter 2:25. See Isaiah 53:5, 10, 11.
                               [ 34 ]
    NOTE.—"Songs of triumph mingle with the music from angel harps, till
heaven seems to overflow with joy and praise. Love has conquered. The lost
is found. Heaven rings with voices in lofty strains proclaiming, 'Blessing,
and honor, and glory, and power, be unto Him that sitteth upon the throne,
and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.' . . . The family of heaven and the
family of earth are one."—The Desire of Ages, pages 834, 835.



                     Lesson 13,      for March      29, 1952

                         The Christian Home
   LESSON SCRIPTURES: 1 Peter 3:1-7; Ephesians 5:25; 6:1-4.
   MEMORY VERSE: "But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is
not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of
God of great price." 1 Peter 3:4.
   STUDY HELP: "The Ministry of Healing," pages 287-294, 349-394.
   AIM: To impress upon our minds the serious fact that the remnant church will
never be prepared to meet her Lord until the homes constituting the church are also
ready to greet Him.
                          DAILY STUDY ASSIGNMENT
1. General survey of the lesson.              6. Read "The Ministry of Healing" se-
2. Questions 1-5.                                 lections.
3. Questions 6-8; memorize 1 Peter            7. Read selections from "The Ministry
     3:4.                                         of Healing" assignment; review
4. Questions 9-12.                                the lesson.
5. Questions 13, 14.

                       Influence of Christian Wives
   1. What counsel does Peter give to wives? 1 Peter 3:1, first
part. Compare Eph. 5:22; Col. •3:18.

    NoTE.—"Neither husband nor wife is to make a plea for rulership. The
Lord has laid down the principle that is to guide in this matter. . . . Do not
try to compel each other to do as you wish. You cannot do this and retain
each other's love. Manifestations of self-will destroy the peace and happiness
of the home. Let not your married life be one of contention."—Testimonies,
vol. 7, p. 47.
  2. What will be the effect of the life of a Christian wife on an
unbelieving husband? 1 Peter 3:1, last part.

   NOTE.—"Great is the work and mission of women, especially those who
are wives and mothers. They can be a blessing to all around them. They
can have a powerful influence for good if they will let their light so shine
that others may be led to glorify our heavenly Father. . . . They can have
an influence which will tend to refine and elevate those with whom they
associate. . . . These women who are doing with ready willingness what
their hands find to do, with cheerfulness of spirit aiding their husbands to
                                         [ 35•]
bear their burdens, and training their children for God, are missionaries in
the highest sense."—Testimonies, vol. 2, pp. 465, 466.
   3. What two qualities are especially mentioned in this whole-
some influence? 1 Peter 3:2. (Moffatt reads, "When they see how
chaste and reverent you are.")

   4. How will such a character be revealed? 1 Peter 3:3, 4.

    NorE.—"The apostle places the outward adorning in direct contrast with
a meek and quiet spirit and then testifies of the comparative value of the
latter: 'In the sight of God of great price.' There is a decided contradiction
between the love of outward adorning and the grace of meekness, the quiet
spirit. It is only when we seek in all things to conform to the will of God
that peace and joy will reign in the soul. The love of dress endangers the
morals and makes woman the opposite of the Christian lady characterized
by modesty and sobriety."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 645.
   5. How is this exemplified in the lives of holy women of old?
1 Peter 3:5, 6.

                         Attitude of Husbands
   6. What counsel is given to husbands? -1 Peter 3:7.

   NOTE.—"The husband should manifest great interest in his family.
Especially should he be very tender of the feelings of a feeble wife. He can
shut the door against much disease. Kind, cheerful, and encouraging words
will prove more effective than the most healing medicines. These will bring
courage to the heart of the desponding and discouraged, and the happiness
and sunshine brought into the family by kind acts and encouraging words
will repay the effort tenfold."—Testimonies, vol. 1, p. 306.
   7. How does Paul set forth the obligation of husbands? Eph.
5:23, 25, 28.

   NorE.—"The husband is to cherish his wife as Christ cherishes the
church. And the wife is to respect and love her husband. Both are to culti-
vate the spirit of kindness, being determined never to grieve or injure the
other."—Testimonies, vol. 7, p. 47.
  8. Upon what basic principle is this obligation established?
Matt. 19:3-6; Eph. 5:31, 33.

    NOTE.—"Around every family there is a sacred circle that should be kept
unbroken. Within this circle no other person has a right to come. Let not
the husband or the wife permit another to share the confidences that belong
solely to themselves. Let each give love rather than exact it. Cultivate that
which is noblest in yourselves, and be quick to recognize the good qualities
in each other."—The Ministry of Healing, page 361.,
                                    [•36 1
                          Parents and Children
   9. What should be the attitude and duty of fathers to their
children? Col. 3:21; Eph. 6:4.
   Nora.—"Children can be molded when they are young. But years pass
when their hearts are tender and susceptible to the impressions of truth, and
but little time is devoted to their moral culture. The precious lessons of truth
and duty should be instilled into their hearts daily. They should have a
knowledge of God in His created works; this will be of greater value to them
than any knowledge of books."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 329.
  10. How should children regard their parents? Eph. 6:1-3;
Col. 3:20.
    NOTE.—"Satan is leading the young captive. Oh, what can I say to lead
them to break his power of infatuation! He is a skillful charmer, luring them
on to perdition. Listen to the instructions from the Inspired Book of God.
I saw that Satan had blinded the minds of the youth that they could not
comprehend the truths of God's word. Their sensibilities are so blunted that
they regard not the injunctions of the holy apostle: 'Children, obey your
parents in the Lord: for this is right.'"—Testimonies, vol. 1, p. 497.
  11. What is said of Abraham's relationship to his children?
Gen. 18:19.
   12. What grave mistake did Eli make in his family responsi-
bilities? 1 Sam. 3:12-14.

    NOTE.—"Eli did not manage his household according to God's rules for
family government. He followed his own judgment. The fond father over-
looked the faults and sins of his sons in their childhood, flattering himself
that after a time they would outgrow their evil tendencies. Many are now
making a similar mistake. They think they know a better way of training
their children than that which God has given in His word. They foster
wrong tendencies in them, urging as an excuse, 'They are too young to be
punished. Wait till they become older, and can be reasoned with.' Thus
wrong habits are left to strengthen until they become second nature. The
children grow up without restraint, with traits of character that are a life-
long curse to them, and are liable to be reproduced in others.
    "There is no greater curse upon households than to allow the youth to
have their own way. When parents regard every wish of their children, and
indulge them in what they know is not for their good, the children soon lose
all respect for their parents, all regard for the authority of God or man, and
are led captive at the will of Satan. The influence of an ill-regulated family
is widespread, and disastrous to all society. It accumulates in a tide of evil
that affects families, communities, and governments."—Patriarchs and Proph-
ets, pages 578, 579.
                            The Elijah Message
   13. What encouraging promise does God make to His people?
Isa. 49:25.
                                      [ 37 I
   14. Before the day of the Lord's judgment, what close family
relationship is assured? Mal. 4:5, 6.

    Nora.—"Before the last terrible judgment came upon the Egyptians in
the death of the first-born, God commanded His people to gather their children
into their own homes. The doorpost of every house was marked with blood,
and within the protection assured by this token all were to abide. So today
parents who love and fear God are to keep their children under 'the bond of
the covenant,'—within the protection of those sacred influences made possible
through Christ's redeeming blood. . . . He is waiting to inspire the youth
with power from above, that they may stand under the bloodstained banner.
of Christ, to work as He worked, to lead souls into safe paths, to plant the
feet of many upon the Rock of Ages."—The Ministry of Healing, pages '403-
405.

      THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
        March 29, 1952—Northern European Division
    The overflow from the offering received on March 29 will go to the
Northern European Division to be used in strengthening evangelistic and
educational work in the mission fields of that division. The two mission
fields that have been chosen to receive help from this fund are the West
African Union and the Ethiopian Union. Let us do our full share in order
that native workers may be trained to hasten the finishing of the work in
these two interesting fields.




         ONFLICT OF THE
                   AGES SERIES
   For spiritual explanation and illumination of the entire Bible
from the time Adam and Eve were driven from the Garden of
Eden to the time when God's ransomed people sing the song of
victory on the sea of glass, this set of books is most valuable to
every Adventist home. As commentaries on the Sabbath-school
lessons, reading for the family worship period, or for personal en-
joyment and devotion, they represent the supreme gift of the spirit
of prophecy as it came from the pen of the author.
