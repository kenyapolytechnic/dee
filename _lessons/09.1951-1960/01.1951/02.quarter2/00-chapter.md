number. At the meeting on a mountain in Galilee, all the believers who could
be called together were assembled.... At the time appointed, about five hun-
dred believers were collected in little knots on the mountainside.... Suddenly
Jesus stood among them. . . . He came and spoke to them saying, 'All power
is given unto Me in heaven and in earth.' . . . 'Go ye therefore, and teach all
nations,' baptizing them into the name of. the Father and of the Son and of
the Holy Spirit: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I commanded
you: and lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world.' Matt.
28:19, 20, R.V."—The Desire of Ages, pages 818, 819.

   NoTE.—"Every follower of Jesus has- a work to do as a missionary for
Christ in the family, in the neighborhood, in the town or city where he lives."
—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 632.

  7. How extensive is to be the final proclamation of the gospel?

tongue, and people the tidings of pardon through Christ are to be carried."—
Gospel Workers, page 29.

                Essentials of the Gospel Commission
   8. What is the gospel? Rom. 1:16.

    NoTE.—The gospel is the good news that Jesus saves from sin. Sin is the
transgression of the law. 1 John 3:4. The gospel, therefore, is the good news
that Jesus saves men from transgressing the law. Matt. 1:21.
   9. What will be the characteristics of the people who are
brought out under the final proclamation of the gospel? Rev. 14:
6, 12.

Rev. 3:14-16, 19.

  12. How is the church to be empowered to carry out the gospel
commission? Matt. 28:18-20; Acts 1:8, first part.

    NoTE.—"It is in doing Christ's work that the church has the promise of
His presence. Go teach all nations, He said ; 'and, lo, I am with you alway,
even unto the end of the world.' To take His yoke is one of the first condi-
tions of receiving His power. The very life of the church depends upon her
faithfulness in fulfilling the Lord's commission. To neglect this work is surely
to invite spiritual feebleness and decay. Where there is no active labor for
others, love wanes, and faith grows dim."—The Desire of Ages, page 825.
   13. What special provision has the Lord made for the comple-
tion of His work on earth? Upon what conditions will this power
be imparted to the church? Rev. 18:1; Zech. 10:1; Acts 5:32.

Him the infirmities of degenerate humanity. Only thus could He rescue man
from the lowest depths of his degradation.... If we have in any sense a more
trying conflict than had Christ, then He would not be able to succor us."—

entered into these poor souls, they were convicted of sin, and many were

                                      [7]
   NoTE.—"It was by personal contact and association that Jesus trained His
disciples. Sometimes He taught them, sitting among them on the mountain-
side; sometimes beside the sea, or walking with them by the way, He revealed
the mysteries of the kingdom of God."—The Desire of Ages, pages 151, 152.

                                 Pentecost

   3. In view of the fact that His visible presence was to be with-
drawn, what provision did Jesus make for His needy disciples?
John 14:12, 16, 25, 26.

    NoTE.—"While Christ was on earth, the disciples had desired no other
helper. Not until they were deprived of His presence would they feel their
need of the Spirit. . . . Therefore it was for their interest that He should go
to the Father, and send the Spirit to be His successor on earth. . . . By the
Spirit the Saviour would be accessible to all. In this sense He would be nearer
to them than if He had not ascended on high."—The Desire of Ages, page 669.
   4. Before the disciples should continue their work after His
ascension, what command did Jesus give them and with what pur-
pose? Luke 24:49.

   NOTE.—"To us today, as verily as to the first disciples, the promise of the

them and will take Him at His word."—Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 20.
  5. What three things did the disciples do in preparation for
Pentecost? Luke 24:53; Acts 1:13, 14.

    NOTE.—"These disciples prepared themselves for their work. Before the
Day of Pentecost they met together, and put away all differences. They were
of one accord. They believed Christ's promise that the blessing would be
given, and they prayed in faith. They did not ask for a blessing for them-
selves merely; they were weighted with the burden for the salvation of souls.
The gospel was to be carried to the uttermost parts of the earth, and they
claimed the endowment of power that Christ had promised. Then it was that
the Holy Spirit was poured out, and thousands were converted in a day. So
it may be now."—The Desire of Ages, page 827.
   6. What results followed the receiving of the Holy Spirit on
the Day of Pentecost? Acts 2:41; 4:33; 6:7.

                                     [8]
    NorE.—"The organization of the church at Jerusalem was to serve as a
model for the organization of churches in every other place where messengers
of truth should win converts to the gospel."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 91.
   8. How is the zeal and benevolent spirit of the early church
brought to view? Acts 2:45-47.

   9. How did persecution stimulate the church at Jerusalem into
carrying out the gospel commission? Acts 8:1, 4; 11419-21.

     NoTE.—"The persecution that came upon the church in Jerusalem resulted
in giving a great impetus to the work of the gospel. Success had attended the
ministry of the word in that place, and there was danger that the disciples
would linger there too long, unmindful of the Saviour's commission to go to
all the world. Forgetting that strength to resist evil is best gained by aggres-
sive service, they began to think that they had no work so important as that
of shielding the church in Jerusalem from the attacks of the enemy. Instead
of educating the new converts to carry the gospel to those who had not heard
it, they were in danger of taking a course that would lead all to be satisfied
with what had been accomplished. To scatter His representatives abroad,
where they could work for others, God permitted persecution to come upon
them. Driven from Jerusalem, the believers 'went everywhere preaching the
word.' "—The Acts of the Apostles, page 105.
                            Methods of Labor
   10. What methods of evangelism did the apostles use? Acts
5:42; 20:20.

   11. In order that the gospel might be preached in regions as
yet unentered, whom did the early church send forth as its first
missionaries? Acts 13:2, 3.

  12. What important part did the lay members in the early
church take in proclaiming the gospel? Acts 11:19-21; 18:24-26.

   13. In the absence of regular church buildings, where do we
find many of the early companies assembling for worship? 1 Cor.
16:19; Col. 4:15.

  14. How long is the gospel commission to remain operative?
Matt. 28:20. Compare 24:14.

   NoTE.—"The example of the followers of Christ at Antioch should be an
inspiration to every believer living in the great cities of the world today....
   "The cause of God in the earth today is in need of living representatives
of Bible truth. The ordained ministers alone are not equal to the task of
warning the great cities. God is calling not only upon ministers, but also
upon physicians, nurses, colporteurs, Bible workers, and other consecrated
                                      [9 ]
laymen of varied talent who have a knowledge of the word of God and who
know the power of His grace, to consider the needs of the unwarned cities.
Time is rapidly passing, and there is much to be done. Every agency must
be set in operation, that present opportunities may be wisely improved."—
The Acts of the Apostles, pages 158, 159.

2.   Questions 1-4.                         Controversy."

   1. What symbol does divine Inspiration use to portray the
apostasy of the Dark Ages? What deception was used to accomplish
the designs of Satan? Rev. 2:20.

    N0TE.—"Little by little, at first in stealth and silence, and then more
openly as it increased in strength and gained control of the minds of men,
the mystery of iniquity carried forward its deceptive and blasphemous work.
Almost imperceptibly the customs of heathenism found their way into the
Christian church. The spirit of compromise and conformity was restrained
for a time by the fierce persecutions which the church endured under pagan-
ism. But as persecution ceased, and Christianity entered the courts and palaces
of kings, she laid aside the humble simplicity of Christ and His apostles for
the pomp and pride of pagan priests and rulers; and in place of the require-
ments of God, she substituted human theories and traditions. . . . And the
world, cloaked with a form of righteousness, walked into the church."—The
Great Controversy, pages 49, 50.
   2. What were some of the ways in which Jezebel led Israel into
sin? 1 Kings 16:31; 18:13, 19, 30.

   3. What do the Scriptures say will be the attitude of this apos-
tate power toward the truth? 2 Thess. 2:7-12; Dan. 8:12.

      4. In what ways has the papacy perverted the truth?
      ANSWER:    (a) By alliance with earthly powers. (Rev. 17:2, 3; 18:9.)
                                      110 1
             (b) By the change of the Sabbath and God's law. (Dan. 7:25.)
             (c) By introducing a counterfeit priesthood. (1 John 2:1, 2;
                    Acts 4:12.)
             (d) By changing the form of baptism. (Eph. 4:5.)
             (e) By claiming divinity and infallibility for the pope.
                     (Isa. 46:9.)
   NOTE.—"The accession of the Roman Church to power marked the begin-
ning of the Dark Ages. As her power increased, the darkness deepened. Faith
was transferred from Christ, the true foundation, to the pope of Rome.
Instead of trusting in the Son of God for forgiveness of sins and for eternal
salvation, the people looked to the pope, and to the priests and prelates to
whom he delegated authority. They were taught that the pope was their
earthly mediator, and that none could approach God except through him."—
The Great Controversy, page 55.
   "This compromise between paganism and Christianity resulted in the
development of the 'man of sin' foretold in prophecy as opposing and exalt-
ing himself above God. That gigantic system of false religion is a masterpiece
of Satan's power."—Ibid., p. 50.
   5. What recovery would the beast make after receiving the
deadly wound? What homage is to be paid him? Rev. 13:3, 8.

   NOTE.—"The infliction of the deadly wound points to the downfall of the
papacy in 1798. After this, says the prophet, 'His deadly wound was healed:
and all the world wondered after the beast.' Paul states plainly that the man
of sin will continue until the second advent. To the very close of time he
will carry forward his work of deception. And the revelator declares, also
referring to the papacy, 'All that dwell upon the earth shall worship him,
whose names are not written in the book of life.' In both the Old and the
New World, the papacy will receive homage in the honor paid to the Sunday
institution, that rests solely upon the authority of the Roman Church."—
The Great Controversy, page 579.

               God's Care for His Persecuted Church
  6. Where did the church find refuge during the long years of
papal persecution? Rev. 12:6.

   NOTE.—The experiences of the Waldenses illustrates this. "Through ages
of darkness and apostasy, there were Waldenses who denied the supremacy of
Rome, who rejected image worship as idolatry, and who' kept the true Sabbath.
Under the fiercest tempests of opposition they maintained their faith. Though
gashed by the Savoyard spear, and scorched by the Romish fagot, they stood
unflinchingly for God's word and His honor.
   "Behind the lofty bulwarks of the mountains,—in all ages the refuge of
the persecuted and oppressed,—the Waldenses found a hiding place. Here the
light of truth was kept burning amid the darkness of the Middle Ages."—
The Great Controversy, pages 65, 66.
   7. How long did the prophecy indicate this persecution would
last? Rev. 12:13, 14.
                             [ 11 ]
   NoTE.="Now began the 1260 years of papal oppression foretold in the
prophecies of Daniel and the Revelation."—The Great Controversy, page 54.
   The word "time" is often used for the word "year." This would be three
and one-half prophetic years. The latter had 12 months of 30 days each,
making 1260 prophetic days or 1260 literal years. See The Prophecies of
Daniel and the Revelation, 1944 ed., pp. 144, 145.
  8. When the tide of persecution, like a flood, was about to
engulf the church, what provision did God make for her survival
and growth? Rev. 12:15, 16.

    NOTE.—"God had permitted trials to come upon His people to prepare
them for the accomplishment of His gracious purpose toward them. The
church had been brought low, that she might be exalted. God was about to
display His power in her behalf, to give to the world another evidence that
He will not forsake those who trust in Him. He had overruled events to cause
the wrath of Satan and the plots of evil men to advance His glory, and to
bring His people to a place of security. Persecution and exile were opening the
way to freedom."—The Great Controversy, page 291.
  9. What characteristics of the remnant church call forth the
wrath of the dragon? Rev. 12:17.

                   The True Church Triumphant
   10. How do we know that the papal persecutions did not suc-
ceed in completely wiping out the truth? Rev. 3:2.

    NOTE.—"The papal power sought to hide from the people the word of
truth, and set before them false witnesses to contradict its testimony. When
the Bible was proscribed by religious and secular authority; when its testi-
mony was perverted, and every effort made that men and demons could in-
vent to turn the minds of the people from it; when those who dared proclaim
its sacred truths were hunted, betrayed, tortured, buried in dungeon cells,
martyred for their faith, or compelled to flee to mountain fastnesses, and to
dens and caves of the earth,—then the faithful witnesses prophesied in sack-
cloth. Yet they continued their testimony throughout the entire period of
1260 years. In the darkest times there were faithful men who loved God's
word, and were jealous for His honor."—The Great Controversy, page 267.

    11. What is the true church called by the apostle Paul? 1 Tim.
3:15.
   NOTE.—If we find the true church, it will have the truth ; and, conversely,
if we find the truth, it will lead us to the true church.

  12. What counsel given the church of Thyatira is good for the
church today? Rev. 2:25.

   13. How complete is to be the victory of the church? Rev. 15:2.

                       Lesson 5, for May 5, 1951

               The Gospel Message for Today
   MEMORY VERSE: Revelation 14:6-12.
   STUDY HELPS: "The Great Controversy," pages 355, 356, 381-390, 409-432
(new ed., pp. 407, 408, 434-445, 467-493); "While It Is Day," chapter 5.
                          DAILY STUDY ASSIGNMENT
1.   General survey of the lesson.     5. Read selections from "The Great
2.   Questions 1-4.                         Controversy."
3.   Questions 5-9.                    6. Read selection from "While It Is
4.   Questions 10-13.                       Day."
                                        7. Review.

                       The First Angel's Message
  1. What message did John hear an angel proclaiming to the
world? Rev. 14:6.

    NOTE.—"A great religious awakening under the proclamation of Christ's
soon coming, is foretold in the prophecy of the first angel's message of Reve-
lation 14. . .. The fact that an angel is said to be the herald of this warning,
is significant. By the purity, the glory, and the power of the heavenly mes-
senger, divine wisdom has been pleased to represent the exalted character of
the work to be accomplished by the message, and the power and glory that
were to attend it. . . . It is declared to be a part of the 'everlasting gospel;'
and it announces the opening of the judgment."—The Great Controversy,
pages 355, 356.
   2. What is the first point of truth proclaimed with great em-
phasis? Rev. 14:7, first part.

   NOTE.—"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom." Ps. 111:10.
Men are exhorted to "fear" God and "give glory to Him." We live in an age
when self-exaltation or the exaltation of a leader of the state is being placed
before the exaltation of God. Man needs to humble himself in the presence
of God, but it is the manifestation of the love of Christ that brings "glory to
God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men."
   3. What urgent reason is given for this challenge to worship
the true God? Rev. 14:7, second part.

   NoTi.—"The subject of the sanctuary and the investigative judgment
should be clearly understood by the people of God. . . . Each has a case
pending at the bar of God. Each must meet the great Judge face to face.
How important, then, that every mind contemplate often the solemn scene
when the judgment shall sit and the books shall be opened, when, with Daniel,
every individual must stand in his lot, at the end of the days."—The Great
Controversy, page 488.
                                      [ 13 ]
   4. What call, fundamental to all true worship, forms a part of
the first angel's message? Rev. 14:7, last part.

    NOTE.—" `The importance of the Sabbath as a memorial of creation is
that it keeps ever present the true reason why worship is due to God,'—
because He is the Creator, and we are His creatures. `The Sabbath, therefore,
lies at the very foundation of divine worship; for it teaches this great truth
in the most impressive manner, and no other institution does this. The true
ground of divine worship, not of that on the seventh day merely, but of all
worship, is found in the distinction between the Creator and His creatures.
This great fact can never become obsolete, and must never be forgotten.' It
was to keep this truth ever before the minds of men, that God instituted the
Sabbath in Eden ; and so long as the fact that He is our Creator continues
to be a reason why we should worship Him, so long the Sabbath will continue
as its sign and memorial."—The Great Controversy, pages 437, 438.

                     The Second Angel's Message
   5. To what is our attention called in the second angel's mes-
sage? Rev. 14:8, first part.

   NOTE.—"The term 'Babylon' is derived from 'Babel,' and signifies confu-
sion. It is employed in Scripture to designate the various forms of false or
apostate religion."—The Great Controversy, page 381.
   6. When Babylon is first mentioned in the Scriptures, of what
spirit does she partake? What accusation was brought against her?
Gen. 10:9, 10; 11:8, 9 (margin, "confusion"); Jer. 51:6, 7.

   7. What is Babylon represented to be? Select the marks which
clearly identify this power as papal Rome. Rev. 17:1-6, 15, 18.

   8. Of what is Babylon the mother? Rev. 17:5.

    NOTE.—"Babylon is said to be `the mother of harlots.' By her daughters
must be symbolized churches that cling to her doctrines and traditions, and
follow her example of sacrificing the truth and the approval of God, in order
to form an unlawful alliance with the world. . . .
    "Many of the Protestant churches are following Rome's example of iniqui-
tous connection with 'the kings of the earth'—the state churches, by their
relation to secular governments; and other denominations, by seeking the
favor of the world. And the term `Babylon'—confusion—may be appropri-
ately applied to these bodies, all professing to derive their doctrines from the
Bible, yet divided into almost innumerable sects, with widely conflicting
creeds and theories."—The Great Controversy, pages 382, 383.
   9. What is Babylon charged with doing? Rev. 14:8, last part.

    NOTE.—"The great sin charged against Babylon is, that she `made all
nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornications.' This cup of intox-
                                      14 ]
ication which she presents to the world, represents the false doctrines that she
has accepted as the result of her unlawful connection with the great ones of
the earth. Friendship with the world corrupts her faith, and in her turn she
exerts a corrupting influence upon the world by teaching doctrines which are
opposed to the plainest statements of Holy Writ."—The Great Controversy,
page 388.

                      The Third Angel's Message

   10. To what is our attention called by the third angel's mes-
sage? What clues are given as to the identity of this power? Rev.
14:9-11; 13:1-10.

    NoTE.—The beast of Revelation 14:9-11 is the same beast so fully identi-
fied in Revelation 13:1-10. It is none other than the papal power.
  11. What power is exercised by the two-horned beast, and what
does he decree? Rev. 13:11-15.

    NOTE.—"The 'image to the beast' represents that form of apostate Protes-
tantism which will be developed when the Protestant churches shall seek the
aid of the civil power for the enforcement of their dogmas."
   "Whe1n the leading churches of the United States, uniting upon such
points of doctrine as are held by them in common, shall influence the state
to enforce their decrees and to sustain their institutions, then Protestant
America will have formed an image of the Roman hierarchy, and the inflic-
tion of civil penalties upon dissenters will inevitably result."—The Great
Controversy, page 445.
   12. What does the two-horned beast cause all to receive? Rev.
13:16, 17.

    NOTE.—"As the sign of the authority of the Catholic Church, papist writ-
ers cite 'the very act of changing the Sabbath into Sunday, which Protestants
allow of; . . . because by keeping Sunday, they acknowledge the church's
power to ordain feasts, and to command them under sin.' What then is the
change of the Sabbath, but the sign, or mark, of the authority of the Roman
Church—`the mark of the beast'?"—The Great Controversy, page 448.
    "When Sunday observance shall be enforced by law, and the world shall
be enlightened concerning the obligation of the true Sabbath, then whoever
shall transgress the command of God, to obey a precept which has no higher
authority than that of Rome, will thereby honor popery above God. He is
paying homage to Rome, and to the power which enforces the institution
ordained by Rome. He is worshiping the beast and his image. As men then
reject the institution which God has declared to be the sign of His authority,
and honor in its stead that which Rome has chosen as the token of her suprem-
acy, they will thereby accept the sign of allegiance to Rome—`the mark of the
beast.' And it is not until the issue is thus plainly set before the people, and
they are brought to choose between the commandments of God and the
commandments of men, that those who continue in transgression will receive
`the mark of the beast.'"—The Great Controversy, page 449.
                                      [ 15 ]
  13. In contrast to those who worship the beast and his image,
what will be the faith and practice of God's true church? Rev. 14:12.


                        Lesson 6, for May 12, 1951
       Christ's Message to the Remnant Church
    MEMORY VERSE: "I counsel thee to buy of Me gold tried in the fire, that thou
mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame
of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest
see." Revelation 3:18.

ter 6.
                          DAILY STUDY ASSIGNMENT
1.   General survey of the lesson.    5. Read selection from "Testimonies."
2.   Questions 1-4.                   6. Read selection from "While It Is
3.   Questions 5-8.                        Day."
4.   Questions 9-12.                  7. Review.

 Laodicean Message Addressed to Final Period of the Church
  1. By what name is the last of the seven churches addressed?
Rev. 3:14, first part.

    NOTE. "The names of the seven churches are symbolic of the church in
different periods of the Christian era. The number seven indicates complete-
ness, and is symbolic of the fact that the messages extend to the end of time,
while the symbols used reveal the condition of the church at different periods
in the history of the world."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 585.
    The ancient city of Laodicea was a prosperous, proud, commercial city
of Asia Minor. The word "Laodicea" means "the judging of the people" or
"a just people," a designation peculiarly fitting tow, the people who have the
responsibility of proclaiming the judgment-hour message.
   2. Who addresses these messages to the church? Why can there
be no question about His testimony? Rev. 3:14, last part. Compare
Rev. 1:5.

     NoTE.—"The testimony, so cutting and severe, cannot be a mistake, for
it is the True Witness who speaks, and His testimony must be correct."—
Testimonies, vol. 3, p. 253.

                   Message of Reproof, Not Rejection
   3. What does the True Witness assert regarding His knowl-
edge of the church and its condition? What does He purpose to
do if there is no change? Rev. 3:15, 16.
                                        [ 16 ]
    NOTE.—"I saw that many measure themselves among themselves, and
compare their lives with the lives of others. This should not be. No one but
Christ is given us as an example. He is our true Pattern, and each should
strive to excel in imitating Him. We are co-workers with Christ, or co-
workers with the enemy. We either gather with Christ or scatter abroad. We
are decided, wholehearted Christians, or none at all."—Testimonies, vol. 1,
p. 126.
   4. What explanation and appeal made by Christ proves that
this rejection is conditional? Rev. 3:19.

   NOTE.—The Saviour Himself states that this severe message of reproof is
given in love and cannot be an unconditional message of rejection, for in
verse 19 He calls the church to repentance.
   5. Of what may the church of God rest assured? Matt. 28:20;
16:18.

                    The Malady and the Remedy
   6. What is the condition of the Laodicean church? Rev. 3:17.

   NOTE.—The True Witness states concerning the church's awareness of its
true condition, Thou "knowest not." He does not charge the church here with
hypocrisy or false doctrines. He states that it is in a state of self-deception
regarding its spiritual condition.
  7. What is the first remedy offered by the True Witness? What
will it do? Rev. 3:18, first part.

    NOTE.—"The gold here recommended as having been tried in the fire is
faith and love. It makes the heart rich."
    "Faith and love are the true riches, the pure gold which the True Witness
counsels the lukewarm to buy. However rich we may be in earthly treasure,
all our wealth will not enable us to buy the precious remedies that cure the
disease of the soul called lukewarmness."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 88.
   8. What is next offered? How may it be obtained? Rev. 3:18,
second part; 19:8, last part. Compare Zech. 3:3, 4; Isa. 61:10.

    NOTE.—"The white raiment is purity of character, the righteousness of
Christ imparted to the sinner. This is indeed a garment of heavenly texture,
that can be bought only of Christ for a life of willing obedience."—Testimo-
nies, vol. 4, p. 88.
    9. What is the last remedy offered the church? From whom is
it obtained? Rev. 3:18, last part.

   NOTE.—"They were blind, yet felt that they were well off. The Spirit of
God did not illumine their minds, and they did not perceive their sinfulness;
therefore they did not feel the necessity of help. . . . The eyesalve is that
                                     [ 17 ]
wisdom and grace which enables us to discern between the evil and the good,
and to detect sin under any guise. .    The divine eyesalve will impart clear-
ness to the understanding. Christ is the depositary of all graces. He says:
`Buy of Me.' "—Testimonies, vol. 4, pp. 88, 89.
    "The churches need to have their eyes anointed with the heavenly eye-
salve, that they may see the many opportunities all about them to minister
for God."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 294.
   10. What glorious experience is promised those whose eyes
are enlightened? Eph. 1:18, 19.

   Nora.—"While those addressed are flattering themselves that they are in
an exalted spiritual condition, the message of the True Witness breaks their
security by the startling denunciation of their true condition of spiritual
blindness, poverty, and wretchedness. . . . We are fully sustained in our
positions by an overwhelming amount of plain Scriptural testimony. But we
are very much wanting in Bible humility, patience, faith, love, self-denial,
watchfulness, and the spirit of sacrifice. We need to cultivate Bible holiness.
Sin prevails among the people of God."—Testimonies, vol. 3, p. 253.
  11. What act on the part of the believer will most effectively
change the character and transform Laodicea into the church tri-
umphant? Rev. 3:20.

    NOTE.-"I saw that many have so much rubbish piled up at the door of
their heart that they cannot get the door open. Some have difficulties between
themselves and their brethren to remove. Others have evil tempers, selfish
covetousness, to remove before they can open the door. Others have rolled
the world before the door of their heart, which bars the door. All this rubbish
must be taken away, and then they can open the door and welcome the
Saviour in."—Testimonies, vol. 1, p. 143.
    12. What further inducement is given the Laodicean church
to change its condition? Rev. 3:21.

   NOTE.-" 'To him that overcometh, will I grant to sit with Me in My
throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with My Father in His
throne.' We can overcome. Yes; fully, entirely. Jesus died to make a way
of escape for us, that we might overcome every evil temper, every sin, every
temptation, and sit down at last with Him."—Testimonies, vol. 1, p. 144.



      "Every man according as he purposeth in his heart,
      so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for
      God loveth a cheerful giver." 2 Corinthians 9:7.

   STUDY HELPS: "Steps to Christ," pages 71-80; "While It Is Day," chapter 7.
                          DAILY STUDY ASSIGNMENT
1.   General survey of the lesson.     5. Read selection from "Steps to
2.   Questions 1-4.                         Christ."
3.   Questions 5-9.                    6. Read selection from "While It Is
4.   Questions 10-12.                       Day."
                                        7. Review.

                                 Repentance
   1. What leads a sinner to repentance? Rom. 2:4; Jer. 31:3.

  2. What cry of Paul expresses the anguish of him who sees his
wretchedness, helplessness, and need? Rom. 7:24. See margin.

    NoTE.—"It is impossible for us, of ourselves, to escape from the pit of
sin in which we are sunken. Our hearts are evil, and we cannot change them.
`Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.' The carnal mind
is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed
can be.' Education, culture, the exercise of the will, human effort, all have their
proper sphere, but here they are powerless. They may produce an outward
correctness of behavior, but they cannot change the heart; they cannot purify
the springs of life. There must be a power working from within, a new life
from above, before men can be changed from sin to holiness. That power
is Christ."—Steps to Christ, page 20.
   3. What is the answer to this cry of the burdened heart? John
1:29.

   4. What invitation is extended to the sinner? Matt. 11:28-30;
Isa. 45:22.

   NOTE.—"Just here is a point on which many err, and hence they fail of
receiving the help that Christ desires to give them. They think that they can-
not come to Christ unless they first repent.. ..
   "The Bible does not teach that the sinner must repent before he can heed
the invitation of Christ, 'Come unto Me.' . . . It is the virtue that goes forth
from Christ, that leads to genuine repentance."—Steps to Christ, pages 29, 30.
   5. What does the Saviour give to those who accept His invita-
tion? Acts 5:31.

  NOTE.—"Repentance includes sorrow for sin, and a turning away from it.
We shall not renounce sin unless we see its sinfulness; until we turn away
                                       [ 19 ]
from it in heart, there will be no real change in the life."—Steps to Christ,
page 26.
   6. How only can our sins be forgiven? Prov. 28:13; 1 John 1:9.

    NOTE.—"Confess your sins to God, who only can forgive them, and your
faults to one another. If you have given offense to your friend or neighbor,
you are to acknowledge your wrong, and it is his duty freely to forgive you.
Then you are to seek-the forgiveness of God, because the brother you have
wounded is the property of God, and in injuring him you sinned against his
Creator and Redeemer.... If we have not experienced that repentance which
is not to be repented of, and have not with true humiliation of soul and brok-
enness of spirit confessed our sins, abhorring our iniquity, we have never
truly sought for the forgiveness of sin; and if we have never sought, we have
never found the peace of God."—Steps to Christ, pages 42, 43.
                              Regeneration
   7. What promise is given to the diligent seeker after God? Jer.
29:13.

   8. As illustrated in the experience of Jacob, what takes place
in the soul before self will submit to God? Why? Gen. 32:24-28.

    NOTE.—"The warfare against self is the greatest battle that was ever
fought. The yielding of self, surrendering all to the will of God, requires a
struggle; but the soul must submit to God before it can be renewed in holi-
ness."—Steps to Christ, page 47.
   9. How is this yielding of the heart or surrendering of the will
described by the Saviour? Luke 14:33.

    NOTE.—"Many are inquiring, 'How am I to make the surrender of myself
to God?' ... What you need to understand is the true force of the will. This
is the governing power in the nature of man, the power of decision, or of
choice. Everything depends on the right action of the will. The power of
choice God has given to men; it is theirs to exercise. You cannot change your
heart, you cannot of yourself give to God its affections; but you can choose
to serve Him. You can give Him your will; He will then work in you to
will and to do according to His good pleasure."—Steps to Christ, pages 51, 52.

   10. What does God do when we thus fully surrender? Ezek.
36:26, 27.

   NOTE.—"You cannot atone for your past sins, you cannot change your
heart, and make yourself holy. But God promises to do all this for you
through Christ. You believe that promise. You confess your sins, and give
yourself to God. You will to serve Him. Just as surely as you do this, God
will fulfill His word to you. If you believe the promise,—believe that you
are forgiven and cleansed,—God supplies the fact. .     Through this simple
                                      20 ]
act of believing God, the Holy Spirit has begotten a new life in your heart."
—Steps to Christ, pages 55, 56.
   11. What will be the experience of one who has truly surren-
dered to God and been given a new heart? 1 John 4:19; 5:3.

   12. While it is God's purpose that we sin not, what provision
is made should we yield to temptation? 1 John 2:1.

    NOTE.—"The character is revealed, not by occasional good deeds and occa-
sional misdeeds, but by the tendency of the habitual words and acts. . . .
    "By what means, then, shall we determine whose side we are on?
    "Who has the heart? With whom are our thoughts? Of whom do we love
to converse? Who has our warmest affections and our best energies? If we
are Christ's, our thoughts are with Him, and our sweetest thoughts are of
Him."—Steps to Christ, page 62.
    "If one who daily communes with God errs from the path, if he turns a
moment from looking steadfastly unto Jesus, it is not because he sins willfully ;
for when he sees his mistake, he turns again, and fastens his eyes upon Jesus,
and the fact that he has erred, does not make him less dear to the heart of
God."—Review and Herald, May 12, 1896.


                       Lesson 8, for May 26, 1951

                      The Life and the Work
   MEMORY VERSE: "Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear
fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in Me."
John 15 :4.
   STUDY HELPS: "Steps to Christ," pages 81-88; "The Ministry of Healing,"
pages 497-516; "While It Is Day," chapter 8.
                           DAILY STUDY ASSIGNMENT
  1.   General survey of the lesson.          Christ" and "The Ministry of
  2.   Questions 1-4.                         Healing."

                               A Twofold Life
   1. What balance did Jesus maintain in His life on earth? Mark
1:35; Acts 10:38.

   NOTE.—"The life must be like Christ's life,—between the mountain and
the multitude. He who does nothing but pray will soon cease to pray, or his
prayers will become a formal routine. When men take themselves out of
social life, away from the sphere of Christian duty and cross bearing; when
they cease to work earnestly for the Master, who worked earnestly for them,
they lose the subject matter of prayer, and have no incentive to devotion."—
Steps to Christ, page 106.
                                        [ 21 ]
   2. What do the Scriptures say regarding fruit bearing? Gal.
5:22, 23; John 15:5, 8, 16; Rom. 1:13.

    NOTE.—"We must live a twofold life,—a life of thought and action, of
silent prayer and earnest work. The strength received through communion
with God, united with earnest effort in training the mind to thoughtfulness
and caretaking, prepares one for daily duties, and keeps the spirit in peace
under all circumstances, however trying."—The Ministry of Healing, page 512.

                       The "Abiding" Experience
  3. What are some of heaven's choicest blessings which are de-
pendent upon the abiding experience?
   ANSWER; (a) Answered prayer. (John 15:7.)
              (b) The abundant life. (Eph. 3:16-19.)
              (c) Victory over sin. (1 John 3:4-6.)
              (d) Our hope of eternity. (Col. 1:27.)
   4. In what words did Paul express his submission to the will
of God? Acts 9:6, first part.

   NOTE.—"By yielding up your will to Christ, you ally yourself with the
power that is above all principalities and powers. You will have strength from
above to hold you steadfast, and thus through constant surrender to God
you will be enabled to live the new life, even the life of faith."—Steps to Christ,
page 52.
  5. How can we maintain our personal relationship with Christ?
Col. 2:6, 7; 1 John 2:6. Compare Acts 10:38.

   NOTE.—"Now that you have given yourself to Jesus, do not draw back,
do not take yourself away from Him, but day by day say, 'I am Christ's; I
have given myself to Him;' and ask Him to give you His Spirit, and keep
you by His grace. As it is by giving yourself to God, and believing Him, that
you become His child, so you are to live in Him. The apostle says, 'As ye have
therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in Him.' "—Steps to
Christ, page 56.
   6. What other important factors enter into the abiding experi-
ence?
   ANSWER: (a) Laying aside every weight. (Heb. 12:1.)
              (b) Trusting in God. (Isa. 26:3.)
              (c) Consecrating body and mind to God. (Rom. 12:1, 2;
                      2 Cor. 10:5.)
              (d) Setting the affections on things above. (Col. 3:1, 2.)
   NoTE.—"Let the mind dwell upon His love, upon the beauty, the perfec-
tion, of His character. Christ in His self-denial, Christ in His humiliation,
Christ in His purity and holiness,. Christ in His matchless love,—this is the
subject for the soul's contemplation. It is by loving Him, copying Him,
                                      r 221
depending wholly upon Him, that you are to be transformed into His like-
ness."—Steps to Christ, page 75.
   7. In what way did Paul experience the abiding presence? Gal.
2:20.

    NoTE.—"Satan will constantly present allurements to induce us to break
this tie,—to choose to separate ourselves from Christ. Here is where we need
to watch, to strive, to pray, that nothing may entice us to choose another
master; for we are always free to do this. But let us keep our eyes fixed upon
Christ, and He will preserve us. Looking unto Jesus, we are safe."—Steps to
Christ, page 77.
   8. .What agencies has God provided for keeping the mind fixed
on Jesus?

   ANSWER: (a)    Prayer. (Phil. 4:6; 1 Thess. 5:17, 18.)
           (b)    Bible study. (John 15:7; 6:63.)
           (c)    Meditation. (1 John 1:3.)
           (d)    Talking to others about Christ. (Rom. 10:8-10.)
    NOTE.—The secret of the victorious Christian life is to believe that when
we yield our wills to Christ He accepts us and begets a new life within us.
Then by keeping the will constantly surrendered and keeping the mind fixed
on Jesus we "abide" in Him. One of the most important benefits of prayer,
Bible study, and missionary activity is that through these agencies the mind
is focused on Christ. If we keep the mind turned continually toward Christ,
He promises not to fail us in the hour of temptation.

                    Service and Growth in Grace
   9. What course should our lives take after we have commenced
the Christian life? 2 Peter 3:18; Heb. 6:1.


   10. How does the parable of the talents illustrate the relation-
ship between growth in grace and diligence in service? Matt. 25:
14-30.

    NOTE.—"The only way to grow in grace is to be disinterestedly doing the
very work which Christ has enjoined upon us,—to engage, to the extent of
our ability, in helping and blessing those who need the help we can give them.
Strength comes by exercise; activity is the very condition of life. Those who
endeavor to maintain Christian life by passively accepting the blessings that
come through the means of grace, and doing nothing for Christ, are simply
trying to live by eating without working. And in the spiritual as in the
natural world, this always results in degeneration and decay. A man who
would refuse to exercise his limbs would soon lose all power to use them.
Thus the Christian who will not exercise his God-given powers, not only fails
to grow up into Christ, but he loses the strength that he already had."—Steps
to Christ, page 85.
                                        23
  11. What symbols does Christ use to illustrate the work of His
church? Matt. 5:13-16.

    NOTE.—"As the sun goes forth on its errand of love, dispelling the shades
of night, and awakening the world to life, so the followers of Christ are to
go forth on their mission, diffusing the light of heaven upon those who are
in the darkness of error and sin."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing,
page 63.
   12. What encouraging prophetic forecast is given of the church?
Isa. 60:1-5.

   NOTE.—"His message to His church at this time is, 'Arise, shine; for thy
light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.' To meet the
conditions existing at the time when darkness covers the earth, and gross
darkness the people, the church of God has been commissioned to co-operate
with God in shedding abroad the light of Bible truth. To those who seek to
do their part faithfully as bearers of precious light, is given the assurance:
`The Lord shall arise upon thee, and His glory shall be seen upon thee. And
the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising.' "
—Testimonies to Ministers, page 458.

5. Read selections from "The Great  7. Review.

                             Spiritual Revival
  1. What divine call preceded great movements in the work of
God? Isa. 55:6, 7; Matt. 3:1, 2; Rev. 3:19.

   2. When backsliding and apostasy had marked the experience
of the children of Israel for many years, how did the earnest
work of King Josiah effect a revival? 2 Kings 22:2, 13, 19; 23:1-3.
(2 Chronicles 34.)
                                      [ 24 ]
    NOTE.—"When churches are revived, it is because some individual seeks
earnestly for the blessing of God. He hungers and thirsts after God, and asks
in faith, and receives accordingly. He goes to work in earnest, feeling his great
dependence upon the Lord, and souls are aroused to seek for a life blessing,
and a season of refreshing falls on the hearts of men."—Christian Service,
page 121.
   3. What earnest appeal did God repeatedly make to His people
through the prophets? 2 Chron. 7:14; Zeph. 2:1-3; Joel 1:14, 15.

   4. What specific course did He urge Israel to take? Jer. 3:12-
14; Hosea 14:1, 2; Joel 2:15-17.

   5. What did God graciously offer to do if His people would
repent? Micah 7:18, 19; Hosea 14:4; Joel 2:12-14.

                  The Final Reformatory Movement
   6. What earnest petition would it be appropriate for us to offer
in this great prophetic hour? Hab. 3:2.

   NorE.—"A revival of true godliness among us is the greatest and most
urgent of all our needs. To seek this should be our first work."—Christian
Service, page 41.
   "I have been deeply impressed by scenes that have recently passed before
me in the night season. There seemed to be a great movement—a work of
revival—going forward in many places. Our people were moving into line,
responding to God's call."—The General Conference Bulletin, May 19, 1913,
page 34.
  7. What experience will accompany a genuine turning of the
heart to God? 2 Cor. 7:9-11; Col. 1:9-11.

   NOTE.—"A revival and a reformation must take place, under the ministra-
tion of the Holy Spirit. Revival and reformation are two different things.
Revival signifies a renewal of spiritual life, a quickening of the powers of
mind and heart, a resurrection from spiritual death. Reformation signifies a
reorganization, a change in ideas and theories, habits and practices. Refor-
mation will not bring forth the good fruit of righteousness unless it is con-
nected with the revival of the Spirit. Revival and reformation are to do their
appointed work, and in doing this work they must blend."—Review and
Herald, Feb. 25, 1902.
   8. What reforms effected in Israel by Ezra and Nehemiah are
as applicable today? Neh. 8:2, 7, 8; 13:10-12, 17-22.

    NoTE.—"Wherever Ezra labored, there sprang up a revival in the study
of the Holy Scriptures. Teachers were appointed to instruct the people; the
law of the Lord was exalted and made honorable. The books of the prophets
were searched, and the passages foretelling the coming of the Messiah brought
                                     [26]
hope and comfort to many a sad and weary heart."—Prophets and Kings,
page 623.
   9. What singleness of purpose displayed by Nehemiah should
characterize the lives of God's people as we address ourselves to
the finishing of the work? Neh. 6:3.


    NOTE.—"Every device that the prince of darkness can suggest, will be
employed to induce God's servants to form a confederacy with the agents of
Satan. Repeated solicitations will come to call them from duty; but like
Nehemiah, they should steadfastly reply, 'I am doing a great work, so that
I cannot come down.' God's workers may safely keep on with their work,
letting their efforts refute the falsehoods that malice may coin for their injury.
Like the builders on the walls of Jerusalem, they must refuse to be diverted
from their work by threats or mockery or falsehood."—Prophets and Kings,
page 659.
   10. What blessings accompany Sabbath reform? Isa. 58:12-14.


    NOTE.—"The prophet here describes a people who, in a time of general
departure from truth and righteousness, are seeking to restore the principles
that are the foundation of the kingdom of God. They are repairers of a breach
that has been made in God's law,—the wall that He has placed around His
chosen ones for their protection, and obedience to whose precepts of justice,
truth, and purity, is to be their perpetual safeguard."—Prophets and Kings,
pages 677, 678.
  11. What is God's desire for the physical well-being of His
people? 3 John 2; 1 Cor. 10:31; 6:19, 20; 1:6, 7.

   NorE.—"The health reform, I was shown, is a part of the third angel's
message and is just as closely connected with it as are the arm and hand with
the human body....
   "In order to be fitted for translation, the people of God must know them-
selves. They must understand in regard to their own physical frames that
they may be able with the psalmist to exclaim: 'I will praise Thee; for I am
fearfully and wonderfully made.' They should ever have the appetite in sub-
jection to the moral and intellectual organs. The body should be servant to
the mind, and not the mind to the body."—Testimonies, vol. 1, pp. 486, 487.
    12. How complete is to be the work accomplished in the lives
of God's people through the reforms of this message? What blessed
assurance is given that the work will be accomplished? 1 Thess.
5:23, 24; Rev. 14:1, 5.

    NoTE.—"Before the final visitation of God's judgments upon the earth,
there will be, among the people of the Lord, such a revival of primitive
godliness as has not been witnessed since apostolic times."—The Great Con-
troversy, page 464.

              Stewardship in View of the End
    MEMORY VERSE: "Honor the Lord with thy substance, and with the first
fruits of all thine increase: so shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses
shall burst out with new wine." Proverbs 3:9, 10.
    STUDY HELPS: "Counsels on Stewardship," pages 35-58, 65-103, 133-167;
"While It Is Day," chapter 10.
                          DAILY STUDY ASSIGNMENT
1.   General survey of the lesson.    5. Read selections from "Counsels on
2.   Questions 1-3.                        Stewardship."
3.   Questions 4-8.                   6. Read selection from "While It Is
4.   Questions 9-13.                       Day."
                                       7. Review.

                God's Ownership and Our Stewardship
   1. In the beginning how did God establish His creative owner-
ship of the world? Gen. 2:3, 16, 17.

   NoTE.—"Herein is set forth a principle that is seen in all God's dealings
with men. The Lord placed our first parents in the Garden of Eden. He
surrounded them with everything that could minister to their happiness, and
He bade them acknowledge Him as the possessor of all things. In the garden
He caused to grow every tree that was pleasant to the eye or good for food;
but among them He made one reserve. Of all else, Adam and Eve might
freely eat ; but of this one tree God said, 'Thou shalt not eat of it.' Here was
the test of their gratitude and loyalty to God."—Counsels on Stewardship,
page 65.
   2. How are we to look upon God with reference to all the bless-
ings that surround us? James 1:17.

   NOTE. "There are only two places in the universe where we can place our
treasures,—in God's storehouse or in Satan's; and all that is not devoted to
God's service is counted on Satan's side, and goes to strengthen his cause.
The Lord designs that the means entrusted to us shall be used in building up
His kingdom. His goods are entrusted to His stewards that they may be
carefully traded upon, and bring back a revenue to Him in the saving of
souls."—Counsels on Stewardship, page 35.
   3. What should be man's attitude in the acquirement of wealth?
 Deut. 8:17, 18.

     NOTE. "The followers of Christ are not to despise wealth;, they are to
 look upon wealth as the Lord's entrusted talent. By a wise use of His gifts,
 they may be eternally benefited, but we are to bear the fact in mind that
 God has not given us riches to use just as we shall fancy, to indulge impulse,
 to bestow or withhold as we shall please. We are not to use riches in a selfish
 way, devoting them simply to our own enjoyment."—Counsels on Steward-
 ship, page 133.
                                       27 ]
            God's Purpose in Making Us His Stewards
   4. Through the prophet Malachi what challenge did God send
to His people? What blessings would follow obedience? Mal. 3:10.

   5. Commending the churches of Macedonia for their liberality,
what does Paul say preceded their gifts? Of whose spirit do we
partake when we abound in the grace of liberality? 2 Cor. 8:5,
7, 9.

    NOTE.—"The spirit of liberality is the spirit of heaven. Christ's self-sacri-
ficing love is revealed upon the cross. That man might be saved, He gave
all that He had, and then gave Himself. The cross of Christ appeals to the
benevolence of every follower of the blessed Saviour. The principle there
illustrated is to give, give."—Counsels on Stewardship, page 14.

   6. As we minister to the needs of others, what benefit comes
to us? Acts 20:34, 35; Prov. 11:24, 25.

    NOTE.—"Divine wisdom has appointed, in the plan of salvation, the law
of action and reaction, making the work of beneficence, in all its branches,
twice blessed. He who gives to the needy blesses others, and is blessed him-
self in a still greater degree."—Counsels on Stewardship, page 13.

         Colaborers With Christ in Finishing the Work
   7. For what purpose did Jesus come to this earth? What blessed
relationship do we sustain to Him in this work? Luke 19:10; 2 Cor.
6:1.

   8. What becomes our responsibility as a knowledge of the
truth comes to us? Rom. 1:14-16.

   Norc.—"The Lord does not propose to come to this world, and lay down
gold and silver for the advancement of His work. He supplies men with
resources, that by their gifts and offerings they may keep His work advancing.
The one purpose above all others for which God's gifts should be used is the
sustaining of workers in the harvest field. And if men will become channels
through which heaven's blessing can flow to others, the Lord will keep the
channel supplied. It is not returning to the Lord His own that makes men
poor; withholding tends to poverty."—Counsels on Stewardship, page 36.

                        God Reserves the Tithe
  9. How much of our income belongs to the Lord? What is the
nature of the tithe? Lev, 27:30.
                                     [ 28 ]
    NorE.—"That specified portion of time, set apart by God Himself for
religious worship, continues as sacred today as when first hallowed by our
Creator.
    "In like manner a tithe of our income is 'holy unto the Lord.' The New
Testament does not re-enact the law of the tithe, as it does not that of the
Sabbath; for the validity of both is assumed, and their deep spiritual import
explained."—Counsels on Stewardship, page 66.
   10. To what ancient plan did Paul refer when explaining the
divine plan for the support of the ministry in the Christian Era?
Heb. 7:5; 1 Cor. 9:7-14.
                           Freewill Offerings
   11. What principles in the making of freewill offerings are
recommended to us? 1 Cor. 16:2; 2 Cor. 8:3, 5, 7, 9; 9:6, 7.

   NOTE.—"All that we do is to be done willingly. We are to bring our offer-
ings with joy and gratitude, saying as we present them, Of Thine own we
freely give Thee. The most costly service we can render is but meager com-
pared to the gift of God to our world. Christ is a gift every day. God gave
Him to the world, and He graciously takes the gifts entrusted to His human
agents for the advancement of His work in the world. Thus we show that
we recognize and acknowledge that everything belongs to God, absolutely and
entirely."—Counsels on Stewardship, page 198.
   12. How much of one's possessions should he be willing to
yield to God in exchange for the divine treasure? Matt. 13:44-46.

   NorE.—"I was shown that it is the will of God that the saints should cut
loose from every encumbrance before the time of trouble comes, and make
a covenant with God through sacrifice. If they have their property on the
altar, and earnestly inquire of God for duty, He will teach them when to
dispose of these things. Then they will be free in the time of trouble, and
have no clogs to weigh them down."—Counsels on Stewardship, pages 59, 60.
   13. With what other sins does the Lord list covetousness? How
complete will be the victory of the redeemed? Eph. 5:3-5; Rev.
14:5.

   NoTE.—"In the last extremity, before this work shall close, thousands will
be cheerfully laid upon the altar. Men and women will feel it a blessed
privilege to share in the work of preparing souls to stand in the great day
of God, and they will give hundreds as readily as dollars are given now.
   "If the love of Christ were burning in the hearts of His professed people,
we would see the same spirit manifested today. Did they but realize how
near is the end of all work for the salvation of souls, they would sacrifice
their possessions as freely as did the members of the early church. They
would work for the advancement of God's cause as earnestly as worldly men
labor to acquire riches. Tact and skill would be exercised, and earnest and
unselfish labor put forth to acquire means, not to hoard, but to pour into
the treasury of the Lord."—Counsels on Stewardship, pages 40, 41.

His followers before returning to heaven? John 14:16-18; Luke
24:49.

    NOTE.—"To us today, as verily as to the first disciples, the promise of the
Spirit belongs. God will today endow men and women with power from

of salvation. At this very hour His Spirit and His grace are for all who need
them and will take Him at His word."—Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 20.

   3. What special relationship with the Holy Spirit is each be-
liever to have? Eph. 5:18, last part.

    NoTE.—"If the fulfillment of the promise is not seen as it might be, it is
because the promise is not appreciated as it should be. If all were willing,
all would be filled with the Spirit."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 50.
  4. Before the apostles were "filled with the Spirit," through
what experience did they pass? Acts 1:13, 14; 2:1.

   NOTE.—"As the disciples waited for the fulfillment of the promise, they
humbled their hearts in true repentance, and confessed their unbelief. . . .
These days of preparation were days of deep heart searching. ... They were
weighed with the burden of the salvation of souls. They realized that the
gospel was to be carried to the world, and they claimed the power that
Christ had promised."—The Acts of the Apostles, pages 36, 37.
   5. What results followed the experience of Pentecost in the
apostolic church? Acts 2:6, 41, 43; 3:2, 6, 7; 5:14.

    NorE.—"In the time of the end, when God's work in the earth is closing,
the earnest efforts put forth by consecrated believers under the guidance of
the Holy Spirit, are to be accompanied by special tokens of divine favor. . . .
The outpouring of the Spirit in the days of the apostles was the beginning
of the early, or former, rain, and glorious was the result. To the end of time,
the presence of the Spirit is to abide with the true church."—The Acts of the
Apostles, pages 54, 55.
    "The outpouring of the Spirit in apostolic days was the 'former rain,' and
glorious was the result. But the 'latter rain' will, be more abundant."—The
Desire of Ages, page 827.
  7. What does the Lord ask His people to do? What promise
does He make to them? Zech. 10:1.

    NOTE.—"But near the close of earth's harvest, a special bestowal of spirit-
ual grace is promised to prepare the church for the coming of the Son of man.
This outpouring of the Spirit is likened to the falling of the latter rain; and
it is for this added power that Christians are to send their petitions to the
Lord of the harvest 'in the time of the latter rain.' "—The Acts of the Apo.itles,
page 55.
                 The Latter Rain and the Loud Cry
   8. What effect will the "latter rain" have upon the giving of
the message? Joel 2:23-29. Compare Rev. 18:1.

    NOTE.—"I heard those clothed with the armor speak forth the truth with
great power....,I asked what had made this great change. An angel answered,
`It is the latter rain, the refreshing from the presence of the Lord, the loud
cry of the third angel.' "—Early Writings, page 271.
   9. What great announcement will be made as the final message
of God swells into the loud cry? Rev. 18:2, 3.

    NOTE.—"The message of the fall of Babylon, as given by the second angel,
is repeated, with the additional mention of the corruptions which have been
entering the churches since 1844. The work of this angel comes in at the right
time to join in the last great work of the third angel's message, as it swells
to a loud cry."—Early Writings, page 277.
    10. Before the impending judgments of God are to be poured
 out in the seven last plagues, what earnest appeal will accompany
 the denunciation of the sins of Babylon? Rev. 18:4, 5.

     NOTE.—"But God still has a people in Babylon; and before the visita-
 tion of His judgments, these faithful ones must be called out, that they 'par-
                                       [ 31 ]
take not of her sins, and receive not of her plagues.' Hence the movement
symbolized by the angel coming down from heaven, lightening the earth with
his glory, and crying mightily with a strong voice, announcing the sins of
Babylon."—The Great Controversy, page 604.

       The Preparation Needed to Receive the Latter Rain
   11. What is the first condition required for the reception of
the Holy Spirit? Acts 2:38; 3:19.


    NoTE.—"Christ has promised the gift of the Holy Spirit to His church,
and the promise belongs to us as much as to the first disciples. But like every
other promise, it is given on conditions."—The Desire of Ages, page 672.
    "It was by the confession and forsaking of sin, by earnest prayer and
consecration of themselves to God, that the early disciples prepared for the
outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the Day of Pentecost. The same work, only
in greater degree, must be done now."—Testimonies to Ministers, page 507.
  12. How earnestly was Israel admonished to pray for the Holy
Spirit? Hosea 10:12.


    NOTE.—"Since this is the means by which we are to receive power, why
do we not hunger and thirst for the gift of the Spirit? Why do we not
talk of it, pray for it, and preach concerning it?"—The Acts of the Apostles;
page 50.
    "For the daily baptism of the Spirit, every worker should offer his petition
to God. Companies of Christian workers should gather to ask for special
help, for heavenly wisdom, that they may know how to plan and execute
wisely. Especially should they pray that God will baptize His chosen ambas-
sadors in mission fields with a rich measure of His Spirit."—Ibid., p. 50, 51.
   13. To whom will God give His Holy Spirit? Acts 5:32.


    NOTE.—"When we bring our hearts into unity with Christ, and our lives
into harmony with His work, the Spirit that fell on the disciples on the Day
of Pentecost will fall on us."—Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 246.

    MEMORY VERSE: "Because thou hast kept the word of My patience, I also

                The Nature of the Final Struggle
  1. What is Satan's attitude as he realizes that his time is short?
Rev. 12:12.

  2. Against whom is the wrath of the evil one especially directed,
and why? Rev. 12:17.

    NOTE.—"It is on the law of God that the last great struggle of the contro-
versy between Christ and His angels and Satan and his angels will come, and
it will be decisive for all the world."—Christian Service, page 155.
    "The remnant church will be brought into great trial and distress. Those
who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus will feel the
ire of the dragon and his hosts. Satan numbers the world as his subjects, he
has gained control of the apostate churches; but here is a little company that
are resisting his supremacy. If he could blot them from the earth, his triumph
would be complete. As he influenced the heathen nations to destroy Israel, so
in the near future he will stir up the wicked powers of earth to destroy the
people of God. All will be required to render obedience to human edicts in
violation of the divine law."—Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 231.
   3. What is the principal issue in the final conflict? Rev. 14:
9-12, 14.

   NOTE.—The messages of Revelation 14 "constitute a threefold warning,
which is to prepare the inhabitants of the earth for the Lord's second coming."
—The Great Controversy, page 435.
   "The Sabbath will be the great test of loyalty; for it is the point of truth
especially controverted."—Ibid., p. 605.
   4. While the people of God are visibly opposed and oppressed
by human agencies, against whom are we really warring? Eph.
6:11, 12.
               Spiritism and Apostate Protestantism
  5. What agency does Satan use in his final deceptions? What
demonstrations will be seen? Rev. 16:14; 13:13, 14.

   NOTE.—"The Protestants of the United States will be foremost in stretch-
ing their hands across the gulf to grasp the hand of Spiritualism.... Through
the agency of Spiritualism, miracles will be wrought, the sick will be healed,
and many undeniable wonders will be performed."—The Great Controversy,
page 588.
                                     ( 33]
                 Spiritism and the Religious World
   6. How many unclean spirits did John see? From what sources
did they emerge? Rev. 16:13. Compare 2 Thess. 2:9, 10.

    NOTE.—"The sources from which these spirits issue, denote that they will
work among three great religious divisions of mankind, represented by the
dragon, the beast, and the false prophet, or paganism, Roman Catholicism,
and apostate Protestantism."—Daniel and the Revelation, page 700.
    7. What two errors open the way for spiritism to deceive pap-
ists, Protestants, and worldlings?

   ANSWER: The non-Biblical views on the state of the dead and on Sunday
sacredness.
    NOTE.—"Through the two great errors, the immortality of the soul and
Sunday sacredness, Satan will bring the people under his deceptions. While
the former lays the foundation of Spiritualism, the latter creates a bond of
sympathy with Rome. . . . Papists, who boast of miracles as. a certain sign
of the true church, will be readily deceived by this wonder-working power;
and Protestants, having cast away the shield of truth, will also be deluded.
Papists, Protestants, and worldlings will alike accept the form of godliness
without the power, and they will see in this union a grand movement for the
conversion of the world, and the ushering in of the long-expected millennium."
—The Great Controversy, pages 588, 589.
    8. In what manner will Satan bring upon the world his final
great deception? What event can he not counterfeit? 2 Cor. 11:14,
15; Matt. 24:23-27.

   NOTE.—"As the crowning act in the great drama of deception, Satan him-
self will personate Christ. The church has long prOfessed to look to the
Saviour's advent as the consummation of her hopes. Now the great deceiver
will make it appear that Christ has come. In different parts of the earth,
Satan will manifest himself among men as a majestic being of dazzling bright-
ness, resembling the description of the Son of God given by John in the
Revelation. [Rev. 1:13-151 The glory that surrounds him is unsurpassed
by anything that mortal eyes have yet beheld. The shout of triumph rings
out upon the air, 'Christ has come ! Christ has come . . . This is the strong,
almost overmastering delusion....
   "Satan is not permitted to counterfeit the manner of Christ's advent.
The Saviour has warned His people against deception upon this point, and
has clearly foretold the manner of His second coming."—The Great Contro-
versy, pages 624, 625.
    9. How does prophecy indicate that Satan will through unclean
spirits lead the nations into final rebellion against God? Rev. 16:
13, 14, 16.

  10. How does Satan, through this world-wide religio-political
movement, receive the worship of all the world, except those who
obey the truth? Rev. 13:3, 4.
                              [ 34
    NOTE.—"Paul states plainly that the man of sin will continue until the
second advent. [2 Thess. 2:8.] To the very close of time he will carry for-
ward his work of deception. And the revelator declares, also referring to
the papacy, 'All that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names
are not written in the book of life.' [Rev. 13:8.] In both the Old and the
New World, the papacy will receive homage in the honor paid to the Sunday
institution, that rests solely upon the authority of the Roman Church."—
The Great Controversy, page 579.
 • 11. How will God manifest His power in vindication of His
law and His people? Ps. 119:126; Isa. 28:21; Jer. 25:31-33; Rev.
19:1, 2, 11-15, 19, 20.

    NOTE.—"The substitution of the laws of men for the law of God, the exalta-
tion, by merely human authority, of Sunday in place of the Bible Sabbath, is
the last act in the drama. When this substitution becomes universal, God
will reveal Himself. He will arise in His majesty to shake terribly the earth.
He will come out of His place to punish the inhabitants of the world for their
iniquity, and the earth shall disclose her blood and shall no more cover her
slain."—Testimonies, vol. 7, p. 141.
    12. What blessed assurance of divine favor is given those who
refuse to swerve from their allegiance to God? Rev. 3:10, 11.


                      Lesson 13, for June 30, 1951

          Final Events in the Great Controversy
   MEMORY VERSE: "After these things I saw another angel come down from
heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory." Revelation
18:1.

733) ; "While It Is Day," chapter 13.
                           DAILY STUDY ASSIGNMENT
  1.   General survey of the lesson.    5. Read selection from "The Great
  2.   Questions 1-3.                        Controversy."
  3.   Questions 4-8.                   6. Read selection from "While It Is
  4.   Questions 9-12.                       Day."
                                        7. Review.

      How Satan Seeks to Hinder the 'Work of Salvation
  1. How do men make the commandments of God of none effect?
Matt. 15:6, 9.

    NOTE.—"Those who teach the people to regard lightly the commandments
of God, sow disobedience, to reap disobedience. . . . If the law were not
binding, why should any fear to transgress? Property would no longer be
safe. Men would obtain their neighbors' possessions by violence; and the
strongest would become richest. Life itself would not be respected. The
marriage vow would no longer stand as a sacred bulwark to protect the
                                  E 35
family.... The civilized world would become a horde of robbers and assas-
sins; and peace, rest, and happiness would be banished from the earth."—
The Great Controversy, page 585.
   2. By what other devices are men led to neglect the great salva-
tion offered them? Matt. 24:37-39; Luke 21:34-36.

   3. While through modern spiritism Satan poses as a benefactor,
what is Satan constantly seeking to do as God's protecting care is
withdrawn from mankind? Job 1:8-22; Eph. 2:2; Matt. 24:7; Isa.
24:4, 5.

    NOTE.—"While appearing to the children of men as a great physician who
can heal all their maladies, he [Satan] will bring disease and disaster, until
populous cities are reduced to ruin and desolation. Even now he is at work.
In accidents and calamities by sea and by land, in great conflagrations, in
fierce tornadoes and terrific hailstorms, in tempests, floods, cyclones, tidal
waves, and earthquakes, in every place and in a thousand forms, Satan is
exercising his power. He sweeps away the ripening harvest, and famine and
distress follow. He imparts to the air a deadly taint, and thousands perish
by the pestilence."—The Great Controversy, pages 589, 590.

              Steps Leading to Sunday Legislation
   4. When false arguments, threats, and bribes prove unavailing
to silence the witness of God's people, in what direction will the
advocates of Sunday sacredness turn for aid? Rev. 13:14-17; 18:3.

    NoTE.—"The power attending the message will only madden those who
oppose it. The clergy will put forth almost superhuman efforts to shut away
the light, lest it should shine upon their flocks. By every means at their
command they will endeavor to suppress the discussion of these vital ques-
tions. The church appeals to the strong arm of civil power, and in this work,
papists and Protestants unite. As the movement for Sunday enforcement
becomes more bold and decided, the law will be invoked against command-
ment keepers. They will be threatened with fines and imprisonment, and
some will be offered positions of influence, and other rewards and advantages,
as inducements to renounce their faith."—The Great Controversy, page 607.
    "The 'image to the beast' represents that form of apostate Protestantism
which will be developed when the Protestant churches shall seek the aid of
the civil power for the enforcement of their dogmas."—Mid., p. 445.
   5. To what do men resort in their opposition to God's people?
Isa. 8:9-12; 28:15.

    NOTE.—"When the leading churches of the United States, uniting upon
such points of doctrine as are held by them in common, shall influence the
state to enforce their decrees and to sustain their institutions, then Protestant
America will have formed an image of the Roman hierarchy, and the infliction
of civil penalties upon dissenters will inevitably result."—The Great Contro-
versy, page 445.
                                      [ 36
   "But still more emphatically are those making a covenant with death
and an agreement with hell, who renounce the truths which Heaven has pro-
vided as a defense for the righteous in the day of trouble, and accept the
refuge of lies offered by Satan in its stead,—the delusive pretensions of Spirit-
ualism."--/bid., p. 560, 561.
                   The Effect of Sunday Legislation
   6. What did the Saviour predict His followers would experi-
ence? How many did Paul say would be affected? Matt. 24:9-13;
2 Tim. 3:12.

   7. What class will be found among the worst enemies of the
truth? What did they lack which caused them to leave the church?
Gal. 2:4; 2 Cor. 11:13; 1 John 2:19.

    NOTE.—"As the storm approaches, a large class who have professed faith
in the third angel's message, but have not been sanctified through obedience
to the truth, abandon their position, and join the ranks of the opposition.
By uniting with the world and partaking of its spirit, they have come to
view matters in nearly the same light ; and when the test is brought, they are
prepared to choose the easy, popular side. Men of talent and pleasing address,
who once rejoiced in the truth, employ their powers to deceive and mislead
souls. They become the most bitter enemies of their former brethren."—The
Great Controversy, page 608.
   8. What will be the result of the witnessing of those brought
to courts of justice? Mark 13:9.

   NoTz.—"Those who are arraigned before the courts, make a strong vindi-
cation of the truth, and some who hear them are led to take their stand to
keep all the commandments of God. Thus light will be brought before thou-
sands who otherwise would know nothing of these truths."--The Great Con-
troversy, page 607.
   9. What course did the Saviour admonish us to follow when
persecuted? Matt. 10:16, 23.

    NOTE.—"The light given me by the Lord at a time when we were expect-
ing just such a crisis as you seem to be approaching, was that when the people
were moved by a power from beneath to enforce Sunday observance, Seventh-
day Adventists were to show their wisdom by refraining from their ordinary
work on that day, devoting it to missionary effort.
    "To defy the Sunday laws will but strengthen in their persecution the
religious zealots who are seeking to enforce them. Give them no occasion
to call you lawbreakers. . . . Keep right on with your missionary work, with
your Bibles in your hands, and the enemy will see that he has worsted his own
cause. One does not receive the mark of the beast because he shows that he
realizes the wisdom of keeping the peace by refraining from work that gives
offense, doing at the same time a work of the highest importance. . •
                                       [ 37 ]
    " 'When they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another' It is not
the will of God that your lives shall be carelessly sacrificed."—Testimonies,
vol. 9, pp. 232-236.
    10. What serious course will Sunday legislation finally take?
What is this period called? What is God's promise to His people
for this time? Rev. 13:13, 15, 17; Jer. 30:5-7.

    NOTE.—"I saw that the four angels would hold the four winds until Jesus'
work was done in the sanctuary, and then will come the seven last plagues.
These plagues enraged the wicked against the righteous; they thought that we
had brought the judgments of God upon them, and that if they could rid
the earth of us, the plagues would then be stayed. A decree went forth to
slay the saints, which caused them to cry day and night for deliverance. This
was the time of Jacob's trouble."—Early Writings, pages 36, 37.
    "Fearful is the issue to which the world is to be brought. The powers
of earth, uniting to war against the commandments of God, will decree that
all, 'both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond,' shall conform to the
customs of the church by the observance of the false sabbath. All who refuse
compliance will be visited with civil penalties, and it will finally be declared
that they are deserving of death. On the other hand, the law of God enjoining
the Creator's rest day demands obedience, and threatens wrath against all
who transgress its precepts:
    "With the issue thus clearly brought before him, whoever shall trample
upon God's law to obey a human enactment, receives the mark of the beast."
—The Great Controversy, page 604.
         The Mighty Deliverance and Glorious Reward
   11. Although the time of trouble and persecution seems long
to God's waiting people, what is His promise regarding the finish-
ing of the work and the deliverance of His people? Rom. 9:28;
Luke 18:7, 8.

   12. What glorious prospect awaits those who have been faith-
ful and have had the victory over the beast and over his image?
Matt. 25:34; Rev. 3:21; 22:14; Isa. 51:11.

    NOTE.—"Upon the crystal sea before the throne, that sea of glass as it
were mingled with fire,—so resplendent is it with the glory of God,—are
gathered the company that have 'gotten the victory over the beast, and over
his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name.' ... 'These
are they which came out of great tribulation;' they have passed through the
time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation; they have en-
dured the anguish of the time of Jacob's trouble; they have stood without
an intercessor through the final outpouring of God's judgments. But they
have been delivered, for they have 'washed their robes, and made them white
in the blood of the Lamb' `In their mouth was found no guile: for they are
without fault' before God. 'Therefore are they before the throne of God,
and serve Him day and night in His temple: and He that sitteth on the
throne shall dwell among them' (Rev. 7:14-17)."—The Great Controversy,
pages 648, 649.

       THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
            June 30, 1951—South American Division
     To greatly aid in breaking down prejudice and in opening up the gospel
 work still farther in the country of Paraguay, South America, it is planned
 with the help of our Sabbath-school members everywhere to build a small
 hospital to accommodate 25 to 50 patients in the capital city of AsundOn.
 A new day is dawning in this field, for souls are being won to the gospel, and
 the medical work has played no small part in the development of the work
 there. The South American Division has provided funds with which to pur-
 chase the land for this hospital, but it is estimated the cost of the buildings
 and equipment will amount to $40,000.
     The last quarter of 1949, Sabbath-school members gave an overflow offer-
 ing of $47,998.15, which was given for the establishment of a hospital in Belem,
 the principal city of the Amazon. Not only were they able to erect a hospital
'with this offering, but a nurses' home and a home for the doctor were also
 built. For this they are truly grateful.
     Let us give as liberal an offering for the establishment of a hospital in
 Asuncion as we did for that in Belem. Make June 30 a double dollar day for
 every member of your church by your offering.
