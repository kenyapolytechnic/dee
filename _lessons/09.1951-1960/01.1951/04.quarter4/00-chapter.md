                      Lesson 1, for October 6, 1951

      Creation Completed: The Sabbath of Rest
    MEMORY VERSE: "Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all
the host of them. And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had made;
and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which he had made. And God
blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it He had rested from all
His work which God created and made." Gen. 2:1-3.
    STUDY HELPS: R. E. Hoen, "The Creator and His Workshop," chapter 14;
"Patriarchs and Prophets," pages 47, 48, 111-116; "The Desire of Ages," pages 281-
289, 769; "The Great Controversy," pages 436-438, 451-460 (new ed., pp. 498-500,
515-525).
    INTRODUCTION: "The importance of the Sabbath as a memorial of creation is
that it keeps ever present the true reason why worship is due to God; for the worship of
God is based upon the fact that He is the Creator, and that all other beings were
created by Him. The Sabbath, therefore, lies at the very foundation of divine worship,
for it teaches this great truth in the most impressive manner, and no other institution
does this. The true ground of divine worship, not of that on the seventh day merely,
but of all worship, is found in the distinction between the Creator and His creatures.
This great fact can never become obsolete, and must never be forgotten. To keep it in
man's mind, God gave to him the Sabbath. He received it in his innocency, and not-
withstanding the perversity of His professed people, God has preserved this sacred
institution through the entire period of man's fallen state."—J. N. Andrews, "History
of the Sabbath," 1887 ed., p. 515.
    "The Sabbath is a sign of creative and redeeming power; it points to God as the
source of life and knowledge; it recalls man's primeval glory, and thus witnesses to
 God's purpose to re-create us in His own image."—"Education," page 250.

                            The Sabbath Instituted
   1. What final act completed the work of creation week? Gen.
2:3.

   NoTE.—Very properly may it be said that God created the Sabbath, for
as portions of the earth's substance had been fashioned by the Creator into
plants, animals, and humanity, and were by Him infused with life; and as
                                          [3]
the rulers of the day and night were by the same Creator ordained to their
duties upon the fourth day, so also a portion of time, the seventh day, was
selected and sanctified as a memorial of the completion of the work of that
entire creation week.
   2. From what type of activity did God rest upon the seventh day
of the creative week? Gen. 2:2; Heb. 4:3, 4.

     NOTE.—"On the seventh day God brought His work to an end on which
He had been engaged, desisting on the seventh day from all His work in
which He had been engaged. So God blessed the seventh day, and consecrated
it, because on it He had desisted from all His work, in doing which God had
brought about creation."—Gen. 2:2, 3, Smith.
     "And God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, for on it He desisted
from all His work which He had created by making."—H. C. Leupold, Expo-
sition of Genesis, page 103.
     To rest does not necessarily signify inactivity, nor even recuperation from
exertion or activity. A lawyer rests his case when the argument has been
completed. Thus the Creator ceases His creative activities, for "the works
were finished from the foundation of the world," and He had completely
accomplished the divine plan of creation of the earth. "All was perfect,
worthy of its divine Author, and He rested, not as one weary, but as well
pleased with the fruits of His wisdom and goodness and the manifestations
of His glory."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 47.
  3. With what satisfaction did God look upon the work which
He had performed during the first six days? Gen. 1:31.

   4. What benediction was pronounced upon the seventh day? By
what name has the day since been called? Gen. 2:3, first part; Ex.
20:11, last part.

                        Purpose of the Sabbath

    5. What declaration did Jesus make concerning His relationship
to the Sabbath? How is this relationship expressed in the fourth
commandment? For whose benefit was the Sabbath made? Matt.
12:8; Ex. 20:10, first part; Mark 2:27, 28.

   6. Of what is the Sabbath a memorial? Ex. 20:8, 11; 31:16, 17.

    Nom.—"The observance of the Sabbath connects man with the origin
of his race, with the six-days creation, and with the Creator Himself. . . .
He that observes the Sabbath aright holds the history of that which it cele-
brates to be authentic, and therefore believes in the creation of the first man,
in the creation of a fair abode for man in the space of six days, in the
primeval and absolute creation of the heavens and the earth, and, as a neces-
sary antecedent to all this, in the Creator, who at the close of His latest
creative effort rested on the seventh day. The Sabbath thus becomes the
                                     [4   ]
sign by which the believers in a historical revelation are distinguished from
those who have allowed these great facts to fade from their remembrance."—
James G. Murphy, Commentary on the Book of Exodus, note on Exodus
20 : 8-11.
   7. How complete was the work of creation when the first Sab-
bath was celebrated? Gen. 2:3; Heb. 4:3, last part.

    NorE.—The creation of the earth was entirely completed at the end of
the sixth day. Modern evolutionism has been built on the premise that
"all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation" (2 Peter
3:4), in a continual state of developmental improvement. This principle of
uniformitarianism presumes that the past is measurable by the present, and
that the future will be of like character. Such a principle denies a Creator,
all miracles, any catastrophic destruction of the earth, and any sin or any
plan of redemption from sin. The Biblical doctrine of a finished creation
commemorated by the Sabbath is the strongest bulwark against such error.
  8. Of what is the Sabbath a sign? How important is Sabbath-
keeping? Of what, then, is the Sabbath the foundation? Ezek.
20:20, 12; Ex. 31:13, 17.

   NOTE.-It is a sign of the authority of God and of His power for creation
and for sanctification, which is a re-creation. "The sign, or seal, of God is
revealed in the observance of the seventh-day Sabbath, the Lord's memorial
of creation."—Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 117.

                          Sabbath Observance

  9. By what are the beginning and the end of the Sabbath.
marked? Mark 1:21, 29, 32; Luke 4:38-40; Neh. 13:19.

  10. What does the Sabbath commandment reveal concerning
God? Ex. 20:11.

   NOTE. —The Sabbath commandment identifies the true God as the Crea-
tor. "Pointing to God as the maker of the heavens and the earth, it dis-
tinguishes the true God from all false gods. All who keep the seventh day,
signify by this act that they are worshipers of Jehovah. . . . The fourth
comandment is the only one of all the ten in which are found both the name
and the title of the Lawgiver. It is the only one that shows by whose
authority the law is given. Thus it contains the seal of God, affixed to His
law as evidence of its authenticity and binding force."—Patriarchs and
Prophets, page 307. See also The Great Controversy, page 452 (new ed.,
p.516).
   11. In connection with the judgment-hour message, to what
will the dwellers upon the earth have their attention called? Rev.
14:6, 7.
                               [5 ]
   12. Although the specific creative acts were completed during
creation week, what does Jesus say regarding the continued activity
of His Father and Himself? John 5:17.
    NOTE.—God constantly provides for the maintenance of life and of all the
other functions of nature. "Should God forbid the sun to perform its office
upon the Sabbath, cut off its genial rays from warming the earth and nourish-
ing vegetation? Must the system of worlds stand still through that holy
day? Should He command the brooks to stay from watering the fields and
forests, and bid the waves of the sea still their ceaseless ebbing and flowing?
Must the wheat and corn stop growing, and the ripening cluster defer its
purple bloom? Must the trees and flowers put forth no bud nor blossom on
the Sabbath? In such a case, men would miss the fruits of the earth, and
the blessings that make life desirable. Nature must continue her unvarying
course. God could not for a moment stay His hand, or man would faint
and die."—The. Desire of Ages, pages 206, 207.

                     Lesson 2, for October 13, 1951

               Sabbath Activities and Blessings
    MEMORY VERSE: "If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing
thy pleasure on My holy day; and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord,
honorable; and shalt honor Him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own
pleasure, nor speaking thine own words: then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord;
and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the
heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it" Isa. 58:13, 14.
    STUDY HELPS: "The Creator and His Workshop," chapter 15; "Education,"
pages 250-252; "Testimonies," vol. 6, pp. 349-368; vol. 1, pp. 531-533; vol. 2, pp. 701-
705, 582-585; "The Desire of Ages," chapter 29.
    INTRODUCTION: "Christ's purpose in parable teaching was in direct line with
the purpose of the Sabbath. God gave to men the memorial of His creative power,
that they might discern Him in the works of His hand. The Sabbath bids us behold
in His created works the glory of the Creator. And it was because He desired us to do
this that Jesus bound up His precious lessons with the beauty of natural things. On
the holy rest day, above all other days, we should study the messages that God has
written for us in nature. We should study the Saviour's parables where He spoke
them, in the fields and groves, under the open sky, among the grass and flowers. As we
come close to the heart of nature, Christ makes His presence real to us, and speaks to
our hearts of His peace and love."—"Christ's Object Lessons," page 25.
                          DAILY STUDY ASSIGNMENT

4. Ques. 11, 12, and selection from
     "Testimonies," vol. 1.

                The Sabbath, a Day of Rest
    1. What command was given concerning the time allotted to
one's own work? How completely should such work be accom-
plished within that time? Ex. 20:9.
                                         [6]
   NOTE.—The commandment is explicit in the words, "do all thy work;"
in other words, "finish your work within the six working days."
   2. How should the Sabbath be regarded? And who should be
included in Sabbathkeeping? Ex. 20:8, 10; 23:12.

   3. How is the day preceding the Sabbath designated? What
preparation should be made on that day? Mark 15:42; Luke 23:
54-56; Ex. 16:23.

    NoTE.—"While preparation for the Sabbath is to be made all through the
week, Friday is to be the special preparation day. . . . On Friday let the
preparation for the Sabbath be completed. See that all the clothing is in
readiness and that all the cooking is done. Let the boots be blacked and the
baths be taken. It is possible to do this. If you make it a rule you can do
it."—Testimonies, vol. 6, pp. 354, 355.
                         The Example of Jesus
   4. What was the custom of Christ on the Sabbath days? Mark
1:21; Luke 4:16; 13:10.

   NOTE.—Christ preached not only in the synagogue, but also in the fields
and along the roadside on the way to and from the Sabbath services.
   5. Enumerate some of the acts of healing performed by Christ
on the Sabbath. Matt. 12:9-13, 15, 22; Mark 1:23-31; Luke 6:6-10;
John 5:5-9; 9:1-7, 16.

   6. Enumerate some of the sermons and parables given by Christ
on the Sabbath. Matt. 12:1, 9, 25-45; Luke 13:10, 18-21.

                      Proper Sabbath Activities
   7. Upon what is the Sabbath blessing contingent? Isa. 58:13, 14.

   NorE.—"None should feel at liberty to spend sanctified time in an unprofit-
able manner. It is displeasing to God for Sabbathkeepers to sleep during
much of the Sabbath. They dishonor their Creator in so doing, and, by their
example, say that the six days are too precious for them to spend in resting."
—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 704.
  8. In what kinds of activities may Christians engage on the
Sabbath? Matt. 12:10-12; Luke 14:1-6.

    NorE.—"And man also has a work to perform on this day. The neces-
sities of life must be attended to, the sick must be cared for, the wants of
the needy must be supplied. He will not be held guiltless who neglects to
                                     [7)
relieve suffering on the Sabbath. God's holy rest day was made for man, and
acts of mercy are in perfect harmony with its intent. God does not desire
His creatures to suffer an hour's pain that may be relieved upon the Sabbath
or any other day."—The Desire of Ages, page 207.
   9. What study should occupy at least a part of the Sabbath?
Ps. 92:1-5 (entitled "A Psalm or Song for the Sabbath Day").

     NOTE.—"God saw that a Sabbath was essential for man, even in Paradise.
. . . He needed a Sabbath, to remind him more vividly of God, and to
awaken gratitude because all that he enjoyed and possessed came from the
beneficent hand of the Creator. God designs that the Sabbath shall direct
the minds of men to the contemplation of His created works. . . . The
Sabbath, ever pointing to Him who made them all, bids men open the great
book of nature, and trace therein the wisdom, the power, and the love of
the Creator."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 48.
     "As a means of intellectual training, the opportunities of the Sabbath are
invaluable. Let the Sabbath-school lesson be learned, not by a hasty glance
at the lesson scripture on Sabbath morning, but by careful study for the
next week on Sabbath afternoon, with daily review or illustration during the
week. . . . In listening to the sermon, let parents and children note the text
and the scriptures quoted, and as much as possible of the line of thought to
repeat to one another at home. This will go far toward relieving the weari-
ness with which children so often listen to a sermon, and it will cultivate in
all a habit of attention and of connected thought."—Education, pages 251,
252.
  10. What special provisions should be made for the children
and youth of God's family on the Sabbath day?

    ANSWER: "Since the Sabbath is the memorial of creative power, it is the
day above all others when we should acquaint ourselves with God through
His works. In the minds of the children the very thought of the Sabbath
should be bound up with the beauty of natural things. Happy is the family
who can go to the place of worship on the Sabbath as Jesus and His disciples
went to the synagogue,—across the fields, along the shores of the lake, or
through the groves. Happy the father and mother wbo can teach their
children God's written word with illustrations from the open pages of the
book of nature; who can gather under the green trees, in the fresh, pure
air, to study the word and to sing the praise of the Father above. By such
associations parents may bind their children to their hearts, and thus to God,
by ties' that can never be broken."—Education, page 251. See also Testi-
monies, vol. 2, pp. 583, 584; vol. 6, p. 359.

                 Importance of Sabbath Observance
    11. Summarize the objectives of Sabbathkeeping.
  The following are suggestive; others may be added:
  a. Recognition of the true God as the Creator of all. Ex. 20:11.
   b. Memorial of a completed creation at the close of the first literal week.
Gen. 2 :1-3.
                                  [8 7
     c. A sign of the power of the Redeemer who sanctifies the believer. Ezek.
20 : 12.
     d. A period of worship of God and of delight in His word. Ps. 92:1-3.
     e. Opportunity for observation and contemplation of the creation. Ps. 92:
4, 5.
     f. Opportunity for greater service to the sick and the needy. Matt. 12:12.
     g. A period of physical rest and appropriate recreation. Ex. 23:12.
     h. A test of discipleship. Isa. 58:13, 14.
   12. How long will the observance of the Sabbath be continued
by God's people? Isa. 66:23.


                     Lesson 3, for October 20, 1951

                       The Dominion of Man
    MEMORY VERSE: "Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of Thy
hands; Thou hast put all things under his feet." Ps. 8:6.
    STUDY HELPS: "The Creator and His Workshop," chapter 16; "Patriarchs and
Prophets," pages 49-51 ; "Education," pages 214-222.
    INTRODUCTION: "Satan, by means of his success in turning man aside from
the path of obedience, became 'the god of this world.' The dominion that once was
Adam's, passed to the usurper. But the Son of God proposed to come to this earth to
pay the penalty of sin, and thus not only redeem man, but recover the dominion for-
feited."—"Prophets and Kings," page 682.
    It was the plan of the Creator that Adam, the regent of this earth, should acquaint
himself with the creation and its laws of operation in their entirety. No branch of
learning or field of endeavor was to be unfamiliar to him. Since dominion will be part
of the employment and responsibility of the redeemed in the re-created earth, a begin-
ning should be made now toward a basic acquaintance with God's creation so that
graduation into the school of the hereafter will be accompanied with promotion to
loftier leadership under the King of the universe. God has planned the establishment
of Christian homes and schools for the purpose of providing such basic training.

wonders of His power, when He came to crown His glorious work, to place
one in the midst to stand as ruler of the fair earth, did not fail to create a
being worthy of the hand that gave him life."—Patriarchs and Prophets,

  4. What was the plan of the Creator concerning man's employ-
ment? Gen. 2:15.

    NOTE.—"To the dwellers in Eden was committed the care of the garden,
`to dress it and to keep it.' Their occupation was not wearisome, but pleasant
and invigorating. God appointed labor as a blessing to man, to occupy his
mind, to strengthen his body, and to develop his faculties. In mental and
physical activity, Adam found one of the highest pleasures of his holy
existence. . . . Our Creator, who understands what is for man's happiness,
appointed Adam his work."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 50.
    "The Garden of Eden was a representation of what God desired the whole
earth to become, and it was His purpose that, as the human family increased
in numbers, they should establish other homes and schools like the one He
had given. Thus in the course of time the whole earth might be occupied
with homes and schools where the words and works of God should be
studied, and where the students should thus be fitted more and more fully
to reflect, throughout endless ages, the light of the knowledge of His glory."

tree of life."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 49.
   12. When, and to whom, will the dominion be restored? Micah
4:8; Rev. 5:9, 10; Matt. 5:5.

                      Lesson 4, for October 27, 1951

 The Eden School: Principles of True Education
    MEMORY VERSE: "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: and the
knowledge of the holy is understanding." Prov. 9:10.
    STUDY HELPS: "The Creator and His Workshop," chapter 17; "Testimonies,"
vol. 6, pp. 126-140, 152-167, 193-205; vol. 3, pp. 131-138; "Education," pages 13-50.
    INTRODUCTION: In order to administer effectively the dominion over which
he was placed, it was necessary for man to have a broad acquaintance with the invari-
able principles of the realm of nature. Adam reviewed the entire creation, learned of
its characteristics and constancy of behavior, and gave a name to every living thing.
Subsequently, it was his privilege to examine all these more thoroughly, to study the
biological and physical laws under which the Creator ordained that they should operate,
and to explore deeply all the natural sciences. In all these, the Creator was revealed
to him in wisdom, power, majesty, and constancy. At first, God communicated with
man in person, and He would have continued to instruct personally any who sought
further explanation concerning the lessons from God's great books. God was the
teacher, the whole world was the classroom, and the great book of nature was the
textbook in the Eden school where the human pupils were to learn the ways of the
Almighty. "Wisdom spoke to the eye, and was received into the heart; for they
communed with God in His created works. : . . Nature is now marred antrdefiled by
sin. But God's object lessons are not obliterated; .even now,. rightly 'studied and inter-
preted, she speaks of•her Creator."—"Counsels to Teachers," page 186.           7 .

                     The Eden Educational Plan
   1. In what environment did God place man? Gen. 2:8, 15. •

    NOTE.—"The system of education instituted at the beginning of the world,
was to be a model for man throughout all aftertime. . . . The Garden of
Eden was the schoolroom, nature was the lesson book, the Creator Himself
was the instructor, and the parents of the human family were the students.
 . . . In His interest for His children, our heavenly Father personally
directed their education. Often they were visited by His messengers, the holy
angels, and from them received counsel and instruction. . . . To Adam and
Eve was committed the care of the garden, 'to dress it and to keep it.'
Though rich in all that the Owner of the universe could supply, they were
not to be idle. Useful occupation was appointed them as a blessing, to
strengthen the body, to expand the mind, and to develop the character."—
Education, pages 20, 21.
  2. With what realms of the natural world was Adam especially
familiar? Gen. 2:9, 19, 20.

    Norz.—"The book of nature, which spread its living lessons before them,
afforded an exhaustless source of instruction and delight. On every leaf of
the forest and stone of the mountains, in every shining star, in earth and sea
and sky, God's name was written. With both the animate and the inanimate
creation,—with leaf and flower and tree, and with every living creature,
from the leviathan of the waters to the mote in the sunbeam,—the dwellers
in Eden held converse, gathering from each the secrets of its life. God's
glory in the heavens, . . . 'the balancings of the clouds,' the mysteries of
light and sound, of day and night,—all were objects of study by the pupils
of earth's first school. The laws and operations of nature, and the great
principles of truth that govern the spiritual universe, were opened to their
minds by the infinite Author of all. In 'the light of the knowledge of the
glory of God,' their mental and spiritual powers developed, and they realized
the highest pleasures of their holy existence."—Education, pages 21, 22.
 Compare Patriarchs and Prophets, pages 50, 51.
  3. Against what kind of knowledge did God seek to guard
mankind? Gen. 2:17.

   4. What questions were asked by Job and Elihu concerning
the character of God's teaching? What, is the proper attitude
toward the omniscient Teacher? Job 21:22; 36:2-26.
                                     12
                          God's Lesson Books

   5. What are some of the means by which the Creator gives
instruction? Job 12:7, 8; Rom. 1:19, 20.
    NOTE.—Even to the heathen who know not the Bible, God speaks
through His created works. "There is a simplicity and purity in these les-
sons direct from nature that makes them of the highest value to others besides
the heathen. The children and youth, all classes of students, need the lessons
to be derived from this source. In itself the beauty of nature leads the soul
away from sin and worldly attractions, and toward purity, peace, and God."
"The sun, the moon, the stars, the solid rocks, the flowing stream, the broad,
restless ocean, teach lessons that all would do well to heed."—Counsels to
Teachers, pages 186, 190.
   6. What is a most fundamental lesson conveyed by a study of
the natural world? Job 12:9.
   NOTE. "The book of nature and the written word shed light upon each
other. They make us acquainted with God by teaching us something of the
laws through which He works."—Education, page 128.
   7. What are some of the specific sources of training, and what
are some of the lessons to be learned from the things of nature that
surround us? Isa. 28:23-29; Prov. 6:6-8; Matt. 6:25-30.
   8. From whom only is the way of salvation learned? Ps. 62:1,
2, 5-7.
   9. By what means did Jesus acquire His education? Luke 2:40,
51, 52; Mark 1:35; 6:2, 3; John 7:15-17; Heb. 5:8.
    NOTE.—"Jesus followed the divine plan of education.. . . His education
was gained directly from the Heaven-appointed sources; from useful work,
from the study of the Scriptures and of nature, and from the experiences of
life,—God's lesson books, full of instruction to all who bring to them the
willing hand, the seeing eye, and the understanding heart."—Education;
page 77.
                  Education of Children and Youth
  10. How early should preparation for the training of the child
begin? Judges 13:7-14; 2 Tim. 1:5; 3:15.

   11. With what diligence were Israel's children to be instructed
in the love and laws of God? Deut. 6:4-7.
 NorE.—"As fast as their minds can comprehend it, the parents should open
Wore them God's great book of nature. . . . Parents can associate God
                                      18
    with all His created works. . . . These lessons, imprinted upon the minds
    of young children amid the pleasant, attractive scenes of nature, will not be
    soon forgotten."—Testimonies, vol. 3, p. 137; Fundamentals of Christian
    Education, page 21'; Counsels to Teachers, pages 79, 80.
       12. What provision for special training was made in the days
    of Samuel and Elisha? 2 Kings 6:1-4.

       NOTE.—"To meet this growing evil, God provided other agencies as an
    aid to parents in the work of education. . . . To this end, Samuel gathered
    companies of young men who were pious, intelligent, and studious. These
    were called the sons of the prophets. As they studied the word and the
    works of God, His life-giving power quickened the energies of mind and soul,
    and the students received wisdom from above."—Education, page 46.
•      13. What is the basic element of all education? Prov. 3:13-18;
    9:10, 11; Ps. 111:10; 119:99, 100.

        NOTE.—"A thorough education, which will fit young men and women for
    service, is to be given in our schools. . . . Let students advance as fast and
    as far as they can; let the field of their study be as broad as their powers
    can compass; but let them make God their wisdom, clinging to Him who is
    infinite in knowledge, who can reveal secrets hidden for ages, and who can
    solve the most difficult problems for minds that believe in Him. We com-
    mend to every student the Book of books as the grandest study for human
    intelligence, the book that contains the knowledge essential for this life and
    for the life to come. But I do not encourage a letting down of the educational
    standard in the study of the sciences. The light that has been given on this
    subject is clear, and should in no case be disregarded.
        "In the instruction given in our schools, the natural and the spiritual are
    to be combined. The laws obeyed by the earth reveal the fact that it is
    under the masterly power of an infinite God. The same principles run
    through the spiritual and the natural world. . . . God is revealed in nature,
    and God is revealed in His word. . . . His power is to be recognized as the
    only means of redeeming the world from the degrading superstitions that are
    so dishonoring to God and man."—Counsels to Teachers, pages 394, 395.


                        Lesson 5, for November 3, 1951

                        The Loss of the Dominion
        MEMORY VERSE: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God."
    Rom. 3:23.
        STUDY HELPS: "The Creator and His Workshop," chapter 18; "Patriarchs and
    Prophets," pages 52-62; "The Story of Redemption," pages 24, 27-41; "Education,"
    pages 23-27.
        INTRODUCTION: "Under the curse of sin, all nature was to witness to man of
    the character and results of rebellion against God. When God made man, He made
    him ruler over the earth and all living creatures. So long as Adam remained loyal to
    Heaven, all nature was in subjection to him. But when he rebelled against the divine
    law, the inferior creatures were in rebellion against his rule. Thus the Lord, in His
                                              14 1
great mercy, would show men the sacredness of His law, and lead them, by their own
experience, to see the danger of setting it aside, even in the slightest degree."—"Pa-
triarchs and Prophets," pages 59, 60.
                         DAILY STUDY ASSIGNMENT
1. Introduction and Ques. 1-4.         5. Read "The Story of Redemption,"
2. Ques. 5, 6, and read "The Creator       pages 24, 27-41.
     and His Workshop," chapter 18.    6. Read "Education," pages 23-27.
3. Ques. 7-12 and notes.               7. Review entire lesson.
4. Read "Patriarchs and Prophets,"
    pages 52-62.
                          Basis of Man's Dominion
   1. What was the original relationship of man to God and to
the angels? What was his relation to all creatures upon the earth?
Ps. 8:4-8.

    2. What test of man's loyalty did God make? Gen. 2:16, 17.

   Nom.—Complete obedience to God's law was required. "There was noth-
ing poisonous in the fruit itself, and the sin was not merely in yielding to
appetite. It was distrust of God's goodness, disbelief of His word, and rejec-
tion of His authority, that made our first parents transgressors, and that
brought into the world a knowledge of evil."—Education, page 25.
  3. By what alluring promise was Eve tempted to disobedience?
What truth and what falsehood were contained in Satan's words?
Gen. 3:4, 5.
     NOTE.—"By partaking of this tree, he [Satan] declared, they would attain
to a more exalted sphere of existence, and enter a broader field of knowledge.
. . . The tempter intimated that the divine warning was not to be actually
fulfilled; it was designed merely to intimidate them." "Eve had been per-
fectly happy by her husband's side in her Eden home; but, like restless
modern Eves, she was flattered with the hope of entering a higher sphere
than that which God had assigned her."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pages 54,59.
  4. What was and still is Satan's purpose in the temptation of
man? 2 Cor. 11:3.
   Nom.—"It was the tempter's purpose to thwart the divine plan in man's
creation, and fill the earth with woe and desolation."—Steps to Christ,
page 19.
                           Man's Relation to Law
   5. What is the basis of moral and social stability? Ps. 119:2, 3,
6, 11, 22, 165.

   6. What example of man's free moral agency is presented in
God's dealing with Israel? Deut. 30:15-19; Joshua 24:15; Isa.' 1:
19, 20.
                                        [ 15 ]
   NOTE.—This is the crux of God's plan. Satan had contended that God
was tyrannical; that created beings were merely automatons. But Satan's
own choice of rebellion was evidence of the falsity of his argument. When
man, the regent of this earth, was given the choice between obedience and
disobedience, the righteousness and the liberality of God's government were
vindicated. Disobedience does not change the law; it merely determines the
sequel. In the natural world, conformity to the laws of momentum enable
one to keep a moving object in a path toward a desired end; nonconformity
results in failure or tragedy. The moral precepts are not different in princi-
ple from the natural laws of the Creator. They, too, forecast the fruition of
a course of action, the sequel to the 'conditions which a man chooses. "But
while everything in nature is governed by natural laws, man alone, of all
that inhabits the earth, is amenable to moral law. To man, the crowning
work of creation, God has given power to understand His requirements, to
comprehend the justice and beneficence of His law, and its sacred claims
upon him; and of man unswerving obedience is required."—Patriarchs and
Prophets, page 52. "It is not God's purpose to coerce the will. Man was
created a free moral agent."—Ibid., pp. 331, 332.

                               Results of Sin

   7. Enumerate some of the results of Adam's and Eve's disobedi-
ence. Gen. 3:10, 16, 17, 19, 23, 24; Rom. 5:12.

   8. How has the natural world shared man's loss? In what
obvious manner has plant life been transformed under Satan's
rule? Gen. 3:18; Rom. 8:22.

    NOTE.—"The God of nature is perpetually at work. . . . He never made
a thorn, a thistle, or a tare. These are Satan's work, the result of degeneration,
introduced by him among the precious things."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 186.
Thus has the enemy sowed tares in God's field. Satan never has had creative
power ; but, as a student of nature's laws, he has caused the development of
many noxious and thorny plants as well as degenerate and ferocious animals.
   9. As a result of sin and the consequent curse, what unnatural
attitude developed between man and the rest of the creation? How
was man's dominion over plants and animals affected? Gen. 3:17,
18; 9:2, 5.

   NorE.—"So long as Adam remained loyal to Heaven, all nature was in
subjection to him. But when he rebelled against the divine law, the inferior
creatures were in rebellion against his rule."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page
59. See also Education, pages 26, 27. One who is disobedient to his superiors
cannot expect obedience from his inferiors. Only through obedience can there
be peace and co-operation.
  10. Who now exercises over the earth the supremacy which
man formerly possessed? Upon what basis does such a claim rest?
Eph. 2:2; Luke 4:6; 2 Cor. 4:4; Rom. 6:16.
                                      ( 16 )
  11. What changes in the relationship between God and man
were caused by sin? Gen. 3:23, 24; 4:13, 14; 6:5.

   NoTE.—After his transgression, Adam could no longer meet his Creator
personally, but still for a time he was permitted to worship at the gate of
Eden. See Patriarchs and Prophets, page 62.
   12. To whom does the dominion truly belong? How was it
obtained? To whom will it be given eventually? Ps. 24:1, 2; 37:
9-11; Dan. 7:18; Micah 4:8.

                      Provision for a Doomed Race

    1. When was• the plan of redemption provided? Rev. 13:8.

    NoTE.—In His infinite goodness and greatness, God anticipates every pos-
sible emergency. In the body of every individual there are provided sub-
stances that will cause blood to clot and thereby check or stop bleeding in
case of injury. It was not the Creator's plan that men should be so injured,
but He made provision for that emergency. Manifold other instances of such
foresight could be• cited. No evolutionary philosophy can explain how a
creature could on its own account anticipate the emergency which might
cause its destruction, and provide in advance to forestall it. "For Thou art
great, and doest wondrous things: Thou art God alone." Ps. 86:10. God
did not plan nor predestine that man should sin, but He did make infinite
provision for the possibility of such an emergency. "The plan of salvation
had been laid before the creation of the earth; for Christ is 'the Lamb slain
from the foundation of the world.'"—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 63.
                                        17
  2. Who made possible the plan of salvation? How many may
benefit from it? Rom. 6:23; John 3:16.

   3. What are some of the purposes of the plan of redemption?
John 10:10; Micah 4:8.

   NoTE.—"But Christ, by His sacrifice paying the penalty of sin, would not
only redeem man, but recover the dominion which he had forfeited. All
that was lost by the first Adam will be restored by the second. . . . God
created the earth to be the abode of holy, happy beings. . . . That purpose
will be fulfilled, when, renewed by the power of God, and freed from sin
and sorrow, it shall become the eternal abode of the redeemed."—Patriarchs
and Prophets, page 67.
                        The Gospel of Salvation
  4. In what words was the plan of redemption first revealed to
mankind? Gen. 3:15.

   NOTE. "All the communion between heaven and the fallen race has been
through Christ. It was the Son of God that gave to our first parents the
promise of redemption. It was He who revealed Himself to the patriarchs.
Adam, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Moses understood the gospel.
They looked for salvation through man's Substitute and Surety. These holy
men of old held communion with the Saviour who was to come to our
world in human flesh ; and some of them talked with Christ and heavenly
angels face to face."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 366.
  5. What prophecy did Isaiah declare concerning the Coming
One? Isa. 9:6, 7.

  6. How was Mary informed of the coming Redeemer and King?
What details of His plan were revealed to Joseph? Luke 1:30-33;
Matt. 1:21.

   7. How does this plan apply to those who are not of literal
Israel? Rom. 9:24-26; 11:11-18.

   NoTE.—In this illustration of grafting an alien scion onto a godly stock,
Paul notes the limitation of the parable by stating that this Christian grafting
process is "contrary to nature." Rom. 11:24.
   8. How does God design that mankind shall be informed of
the plan of salvation? Mark 16:15; Rom. 10:14, 15, 17, 18. Com-
pare Ps. 19:1-4.

    NoTE.—God has chosen to have human messengers proclaim His plan of
salvation to the world, but men have been feeble and inefficient in accom-
plishing that grand purpose. Thousands who have neither heard the living
                                     [ 18 ]
preacher nor seen the written word have only God's book of nature, whose
"words" have gone "to the end of the world." "Among the heathen are
those who worship God ignorantly, those to whom the light is never brought
by human instrumentality, yet they will not perish. Though ignorant of
the written law of God, they have heard His voice speaking to them in
nature, and have done the things that the law required. Their works are
evidence that the Holy Spirit has touched their hearts, and they are recog-
nized as the children of God."—The Desire of Ages, page 638.
   "Though marred by sin, it [nature] speaks not only of creation but of
redemption. . . . Thus the very objects and operations of nature that bring
so vividly to mind our great loss become to us the messengers of hope."—
Education, page 27.
                         Faith Is Indispensable
   9. What attitude is essential to a correct and full understand-
ing of God's work as it is revealed in the creation of the natural
world? How does this attitude illustrate spiritual faith? Heb. 11:
1, 3, 6; 12:1, 2; Gal. 3:6-9.

    NOTE.-Truly, faith is "evidence of things not seen," of things invisible
to natural eyesight. But invisibility in no way minimizes the validity of the
evidence. An exact knowledge of many things is acquired without even the
possibility of visibility. None but the brighter stars have ever been seen by
the human eye, even with the aid of the telescope. Untold millions of stars
whose images are recorded on photographic plates have never been viewed
by human eyes, but the record of the transformed chemicals on the photo-
graphs is "evidence of things not seen." Air in its ordinary gaseous form is
entirely invisible, but its presence and behavior are learned from its effects
upon visible objects. So great confidence is placed upon such evidence that
few would at present hesitate to trust their lives to the buoyant effect of
this invisible reality. No one has ever seen a molecule of air, water, or any
other such common substance, but the very sizes of these molecules have been
determined with uncanny precision by methods not too difficult to explain
or to understand. Few persons have viewed the top of Mount Everest, but
no pupil of geography doubts the existence of that mighty elevation. Even
the names of common objects or places cannot be ascertained by mere
observation, but must be obtained from the oral or written statements of
others, and are thus learned by the simple process of faith—implicit confi-
dence and belief—that the informant is providing reliable information. Can
anyone do less than have faith that the "evidence of things not seen" in the
lives of the great "cloud of witnesses" of the past, and the evidences abound-
ing in the design and provisions of the natural world, point to the Creator of
the universe and to His soon return as the Redeemer and Re-creator of a
fallen world?
   10. What accompanies saving faith? Eph. 2:8-10; James 2:14-
20; Rev. 14:12.

   NorE.—In the record of the faithful of old, in Hebrews 11, there is
abundant evidence that the faith of those men and women was productive
of appropriate and vigorous activity in God's service. Abraham obeyed,
                                    [ 191
though he could not at the time see the object and reward of his service.
Moses likewise "endured, as seeing Him who is invisible."
   11. What will be the condition of the redeemed as their time
of redemption approaches? Titus 2:12-14; Rev. 22:10-14.

   12. What does the plan of redemption ultimately embrace?
2 Peter 3:13; Rev. 21:1-5.


                    Lesson 7, for November 17, 1951

   The World That Then Was; Under the Curse
    MEMORY VERSE: "Cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou
eat of it all the days of thy life; thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee."
Gen. 3:17, 18.
    LESSON HELPS: "The Creator and His Workshop," chapter 20; "The Story
of Redemption," pages 39-41, 52-61; "Patriarchs and Prophets," pages 71-92.
    INTRODUCTION: "God cursed tke ground because of their sin in eating of the
tree of knowledge [of good and evil], and declared, 'In sorrow shalt thou eat of it
all the days of thy life.' He had apportioned them the good, but withheld the evil.
Now He declares that they shall eat of it, that is, they should be acquainted with
evil all the days of their life.
    "The race from that time forward was to be afflicted by Satan's temptations. A
life of perpetual toil and anxiety was appointed unto Adam, instead of the happy,
cheerful labor he had hitherto enjoyed. They should be subject to disappointment,
grief, and pain, and finally come to dissolution. They were made of the dust of the
earth, and unto dust should they return."—"The Story of Redemption," page 40.

                   The Immediate Effects of the Curse

  1. What reason is given for man's ejection from the Garden of
Eden? How was the garden guarded? Gen. 3:22-24.

   NOTE.—"The Garden of Eden remained upon the earth long after man
had become an outcast from its pleasant paths. The fallen race were long
permitted to gaze upon the home of innocence, their entrance barred only
by the watching angels. At the cherubim-guarded gate of Paradise the
divine glory was revealed. Hither came Adam and his sons to worship God.
Here they renewed their vows of obedience to that law the transgression of
which had banished them from Eden. When the tide of iniquity overspread
the world, and the wickedness of men determined their destruction by a flood
of waters, the hand that had planted Eden withdrew it• from the earth."—
Patriarchs and Prophets, page 62.
                                          [ 20 ]
  2. What provision did God make for the bodily protection of
Adam and Eve? Gen. 3:21.
   NOTE.—"The atmosphere, once so mild and uniform in temperature, was
now subject to marked changes, and the Lord mercifully provided them
with a garment of skins as a protection from the extremes of heat and cold."
—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 61.
   3. What were some of the immediate results of the curse? Gen.
3:17-19.
   4. What further change in the productiveness of the earth fol-
lowed Cain's great sin? Gen. 4:12.

   NOTE.—In spite of decreased fertility of the soil and a less favorable cli-
mate, the record indicates that luxuriant vegetation and vigorous animal life
prevailed on the earth even down to the Flood. "There were evident tokens
of decay, but the earth was still rich and beautiful in the gifts of God's provi-,
dence. . . . The trees far surpassed in size, beauty, and perfect proportion,
any now to be found; their wood was of fine grain and hard substance, closely
resembling stone, and hardly less enduring. Gold, silver, and precious stones
existed in abundance."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 90.
  5. Because of the curse upon the ground, what comfoit did,
Lamech derive from the birth of his son Noah? Gen. 5:29.

   Non.—In Eden before the curse, Adam engag6d in "happy, Cheerful
labor." This labor was a blessing to body, mind, and soul. After the curse
the soil was not so fertile nor so friable, and the degenerate plants now called
weeds became abundant. So man was under the necessity of strenuous effort
in order to supply himself with food and shelter. Actually the weeds were
a blessing to him, for without them he would have failed to till the soil
sufficiently to promote the growth of desirable plants. Thus, in manifold
ways, God permits the effects of the curse to become a blessing to falleniman-)
kind.
  6. Of what physical stature were many of the antediluvian men?
Gen. 6:4.
    NOTE.—"The human race yet retained much of its early vigor. But a
few generations had passed since Adam had access to the tree which was to
prolong life; and man's existence was still measured by centuries. . . . There
were many giants, men of great stature and strength, renowned for wisdom,
skillful in devising the most cunning and wonderful works; but their guilt
in giving loose rein to iniquity was in proportion to their 'skill and mental
ability."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 90.
                      The Path Away From Eden
   7. What kinds of employment are mentioned as being developed
after the exile from Eden? Gen. 4:2, 20-22.
                                      ( 21 ]
   8. What centralizing influence was developed through the
leadership of Cain? Gen. 4:17.

     NOTE.—The family of Cain is the first recorded which built a city. It
centralized in one locality for protection and to ensure a more compact social
life.
  9. What was the first recorded crime committed after the Fall?
Gen. 4:8-10.

   10. What other outstanding violations of God's law were
prevalent during antediluvian times? Gen. 4:23; 6:2, 5, 11-13;
Luke 17:27.

     Nom.—"The descendants of Seth were called the sons of God; the
descendants of Cain, the sons of men. As the sons of God mingled with the
sons of men, they became corrupt and, by intermarriage with them, lost,
through the influence of their wives, their peculiar, holy character, and united
with the sons of Cain in their idolatry."—The Story of Redemption, page 62.
     "They [the antediluvians] sought only to gratify the desires of their own
proud hearts, and reveled in scenes of pleasure and wickedness. Not desiring
to retain God in their knowledge, they soon came to deny His existence.
. . . Men put God out of their knowledge, and worshiped the creatures of
their own imagination; and as the result, they became more and more
debased. . . . The worshipers of false gods clothed their deities with human
attributes and passions, and thus their standard of character was degraded
to the likeness of sinful humanity. They were defiled in consequence. . .
Neither the marriage relation nor the rights of property were respected."—
Patriarchs and Prophets, pages 90-92.
                   God's Long-Suffering and Mercy

  11. How merciful was God toward the ungodly antediluvians?
Gen. 6:3, 8; 1 Peter 3:20.

  12. Besides Abel and Noah, who were some other outstanding
godly men in those times? Jude 14, 15; Gen. 5:22-24; 4:26; 5:28, 29.



                   Lesson 8, for November 24, 1951

           The Deluge and the Bow of Promise
    MEMORY VERSE: "Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were
in it, they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness, saith the Lord
God." Ezek. 14:14.

    INTRODUCTION: The earth itself provides abundant evidence that at some
time even the highest mountains have been submerged completely by sea. Evolu-
tionistic philosophy explains this by teaching that there have been gradual subsidence
and emergence of the land through long ages. On the other hand, the Bible por-
trays an extraordinary and cataclysmic event which occurred within a single year.
During the first forty days of that eventful year the rain from above was torrential
and devastating, but the most extensive destruction and flooding manifestly resulted
as " 'the fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the windows of heaven
were opened.' Water appeared to come from the clouds in mighty cataracts. Rivers
broke away from their boundaries, and overflowed the valleys. Jets of water burst
from the earth with indescribable force, throwing massive rocks hundreds of feet
into the air, and these, in falling, buried themselves deep in the ground."—"Patriarchs
and Prophets," page 99.

                    Warning to a Godless Generation
   1. As a result of the universal wickedness which prevailed in
the days of Noah, what did God announce that He would do to
the earth? Gen. 6:5, 6, 13, 17.

   2. What message did Noah preach while he was building the
ark? How many still living at the time of the Deluge heeded the
message? 2 Peter 2:5; 1 Peter 3:20; Gen. 7:7, 13.

   NoTE.—"While Noah was giving his warning message to the world, his
works testified of his sincerity. It was thus that his faith was perfected and
made evident. He gave the world an example of believing just what God
says. All that he possessed, he invested in the ark."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
page 95.
    3. Why did God spare Noah and his family? Gen. 7:1, 5.

                              Preparing the Ark
   4. What instruction was given to Noah concerning a means for
the preservation of himself and his family? How did Noah act
upon the instruction? Gen. 6:14, 18; Heb. 11:7.

    NoTE.—Noah was not preserved through the Deluge merely by his own
efforts, for no ship could have withstood the fury of the storm and the
upheavals of the earth during that cataclysm. While "angels that excel in
strength were commissioned to preserve it" (Patriarchs and Prophets, page
100), the ark itself was a work of faith on the part of Noah. Both faith and
obedience are essential to salvation.
                                        [ 23 ]
   5. How large was the ark? What specifications were given for
the construction of the ark? Gen. 6:15, 16.

   NcrrE.—This massive ship was not less than 450 feet long, 75 feet wide,
and 45 feet high. Its three stories provided something like 75,000 to 100,000
square feet of floor area—abundant room for representatives of allthe kinds
of animals with which God originally populated the earth.
    If the long cubit of 22 inches was used, then the ark was 550 feet long.
Compare measurements of the tabernacle (Ex. 26:16, 18, 20 and Patriarchs
and Prophets, page 347).
   6. What living creatures were accommodated in the ark? What
provision was made for food for them? Gen. 6:19-21; 7:2, 3.

                               The Deluge
   7. From what sources did the Deluge waters come? Gen. 7:4,
11, 12.

   8. How completely did the water cover the earth? For how
long a time was the entire surface of the earth covered with water?
Gen. 7:20, 24; 8:5.

    9. How complete was the destruction accomplished by this
divine judgment? How much time elapsed from the beginning
of the Flood until the earth was dry? Gen. 7:21-23, 10, 11; 8:13, 14.

   NOTE.—The Hebrew calendar was a lunar one, with approximately 354
days in the twelve months. Therefore, from the day the Flood began; on the
seventeenth day of the second month, until the twenty-seventh day of the
second month of the next year when the earth was dry again, was a period
of 365 days, or one solar year, counting inclusively the first and last days,
as was the ancient custom.
   10. What care did God take of the ark? Gen. 7:16, 18; 8:1, 15-17.

    NorE.—"The massive door, which it was impossible for those within to
close, was slowly swung to its place by unseen hands. Noah was shut in, and
the rejectors of God's mercy were shut out. The seal of Heaven, was on that
door; God had shut it, and God alone could open it." "All that men could
do was done to render the work perfect, yet the ark could not of itself have
withstood the storm which was to come upon the earth. God alone could
preserve His servants upon the tempestuous waters."—Patriarchs and Proph-
ets, page 98, 95.
  11. As the waters subsided, where did the ark come to rest?
What did Noah do on several occasions during his next three
months' stay in the ark? Gen. 8:4-13.
                                   [ 24 ]
    NOTE.—"As the waters began to subside, the Lord caused the ark to drift
into a spot protected by a group of mountains that had been preserved by
His power. These mountains were but a little distance apart, and the ark
moved about in this quiet haven, and was no longer driven upon the bound-
less ocean'. This gave great relief to the weary, tempest-tossed voyagers."—
Patriarchs and Prophets, page 105.

                             The Promises of God

   12. What was Noah's first act upon leaving the ark? What
blessing was bestowed upon his family? Gen. 8:20; 9:1, 7.

   13. What covenant did God establish with mankind after the
Deluge? What was the pledge of that covenant? Gen. 8:21, 22;
9:9-16. Compare Isa. 54:9, 10.

    NOTE.—"Lest the gathering clouds and falling rain should fill men with
constant terror, from fear of another flood, the Lord encouraged the family
of Noah by a promise: 'I will establish My covenant with you; . . . neither
shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth. . . . I do set My bow
in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between Me and the
earth., And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that
the bow shall be seen in the cloud; . . . and I will look upon it, that I may
remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature.' "
—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 106.
    "The rainbow spanning the heavens with its arch of light is a token of
`the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature.' And the
rainbow encircling the throne on high is also a token to God's children of His
covenant of peace."—Education, page 115.

                       The Language of Nature

  1. By what means are the invisible things of God understood?
Rom. 1:20.

    NOTE.—The invisible things of everyday life are revealed by visible effects.
No one can see gaseous air, but because moving air plays upon the leaves
of the trees, it is common to say, "See the wind blow." Electrical charges
cannot be seen; but when in motion they heat the wires by which they are
transmitted and produce magnetic effects in their vicinity, so that their
presence can be demonstrated. Thus in manifold ways the existence of the
invisible is made plain through the visible.
   2. How extensive and effective is the witness of nature? What
is necessary in order correctly to understand the language of
nature? Ps. 19:1-4; Rom. 10:18. Compare Heb. 11:3.

   NoTE.—The margin of Psalm 19:3 in the Authorized Version reads,
"There is no speech nor language, without these their voice is heard." The
American Revised Version reads, "There is no speech nor language; their
voice is not heard."
                 "To him who, in the love of Nature, holds
                 Communion with her visible forms, she speaks
                 A various language."—Bryant.
     In declaring the glory and creative ability of God, nature employs no
audible speech nor language; yet her message goes convincingly to the end
of the world. The fact of the existence of a planned and complex creation
is in itself abundant evidence of a Creator. The fact of a delicate balance
between climatic conditions and the chemistry and physiology of living things
is likewise evidence of design, not of chance.
  3. In what attitude should one seek to learn of God through
His works in nature? Ps. 8:3, 4.

     NoTE.—Humility is a prerequisite of learning. While God made the things
  of nature to be "pleasant to the sight," and intended that Man'should enjoy
 the esthetic aspects of His creation, He also "hath made ..His wonderful
  works to be remembered" (Ps. 111:4) ; and, still further, He has admonished
,that: one _should consider inquiringly how the lilies grow (Matt. 6:28), and
  how high the stars are (Job 22:12).
                                     [ 26 ]
                  Leaves From the Book of Nature

   4. How much concern need the animal creation have for their
daily sustenance? By what mediate means has the Creator made
provision for the daily requirements of animal life? Matt. 6:26;
Ps. 104:10-12, 14, 16-18, 27, 28.

   5. In the questions put to Job, how does God indicate the
orderly operation of animal instincts? Job 38:39-41; 39:1, 2,.5, 13,
14, 26-30.

   NOTE.—God has provided instincts for the animals, and thus He has
enabled them to perform unlearned functions successfully. They have
inherited a behavior pattern that is quite constant, and distinctively, in
accordance with the needs of each type of animal. Though the Creator
provided instincts abundantly for the animal creation, He in magnanimous
wisdom made man a free moral agent, not slavishly dependent on instincts,
but amenable to education and to conscious voluntary submission to His
natural and moral laws.
  6. What lesson may we learn from the grass beneath our feet?
Matt. 6:30; Ps. 103:15-18.

    NOTE.—In autumn the grass may be as brown and dry as straw. Though
it appears dead and worthless, when the rains come again it will be verdantly
beautiful. God provides even for the grass of the field.
  7. By what illustration does God portray the unending life
which He will provide to the redeemed? Isa. 65:22.

    NoTE.—In contrast to herbs and grasses, such as sunflowers or wheat,
most trees have what is known as indeterminate growth; that is, there is no
head or. fruit .which terminates -their stems and necessitates the cessation or
retreat of their activities. The tree continues to grow larger and taller each
year. So those who fulfill the conditions of redemption will enter upon that
eternal life of unlimited, unceasing spiritual and mental development, "as
the days of a tree."
  8. With what fact in the natural world does God illustrate the
magnitude of His forgiveness? Ps. 103:12;

   NOTE.-It is noteworthy that the Scripture does not indicate "as far as the
south is from the north," which would be a scant 13,000 miles. East and west
are opposite directions, each without end: No matter how far ohe'tnay travel
eastward; east still lies before him. So with God's nierci;" it is absOlUfely
unlimited.
   9. How did Christ illUstrile the'getiuitte,- innate. chaiader36f
the true Christian? Matt. 5:13.
                              E 271
     NOTE.—Every chemical substance is invariable in its properties and com-
position. Only when its components are freed from each other, or are joined
to other elements to form new compounds, do the properties of the original
substance disappear. Salt cannot lose its saltiness without ceasing to be salt
and losing its value as a seasoning agent. "If the salt have lost his savor,
. . . it is thenceforth good for nothing." Likewise, the name Christian
applied to one without Christian characteristics is a misnomer and an impos-
sibilty.
   10. In whom does our eternal life reside? How do we enter
into it? 1 John 5:11, 12; John 3:3, 5.

   NorE.—Just as physical life must have resided in previously existing liv-
ing beings, and initially in the higher Life in whom "we live, and move, and
have our being;" so also in the spiritual realm, life comes only from ante-
cedent life. Except one "be born . . of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the
kingdom of God."

   11. What natural process illustrates the progressive develop-
ment of Christian life under the influence of the Spirit? Mark 4:
26-28.

   12. After all our study of created things what conclusion must
be reached concerning the Creator? What do the magnitude and
marvelous organization of the natural world show concerning
Him? Job 26:14; Ps. 104:24; Rom. 11:33.




                     Lesson 10,      for December          8, 1951

     'True Science Versus Present-Day Theories
    MEMORY VERSE: "Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days
scoffers, walking after their own lusts, and saying, Where is the promise of His com-
ing? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning
of the creation." 2 Peter 3:3, 4.

archs and Prophets," pages 107-116; "Testimonies," vol. 8, pp. 255-264.
    INTRODUCTION: "The harmony of creation depends upon the perfect con-
formity of all beings, of everything, animate and inanimate, to the law of the Creator.
God has ordained laws for the government, not only of living beings, but of all the
operations of nature. Everything is under fixed laws, which cannot be disregarded.
But while everything in nature is governed by natural laws, man alone, of all that
inhabits the earth, is amenable to moral law. To man, the crowning work of creation,
God has given power to understand His requirements, to comprehend the justice and
beneficence of His law, and its sacred claims upon him; and of man unswerving
obedience is required."-mv"Patriarchs and Prophets," page 52,

                   Principles of the Natural World
   1. How does the psalmist set forth the operation of the laws
of nature? Whose ordinances are they? Ps. 104:2, 3, 5, 6-14, 19-21.

    NorE.—"As the foundation principle of all education in these lines, the
youth should be taught that the laws of nature are the laws of God,—as
truly divine as are the precepts of the Decalogue."—Education, page 196.
    "God is as truly the author of physical laws as He is the author of the
moral law."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 347.
  2. How constant and unchangeable is the Creator? Isa. 40:28;
Mal. 3:6.

    NorE.—Miracles are God's extraordinary way of doing things for excep-
tional or emergency purposes, but the laws of nature—His laws in the material
realm—are His regular and ordinary way of doing things. It has been said
well that "the laws of nature are the delegated will of the Almighty." These
laws are not the enactments of a legislative body, subject to amendment or
repeal. They are the uniform and unalterable response of created things to
the conditions imposed upon them, because of the characteristics invested in
these bodies by the Creator. God produced energy, matter, and all living
and moving things according to definite patterns of form and behavior.
"The Lord does not work through His laws to supersede the laws of nature.
He does His work through the laws and properties of His instruments, and
nature obeys a 'Thus saith the Lord.' "—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 186.
   3. What would God have us learn concerning the constancy
of His laws, or ordinances, in the natural world? With what
natural laws does He exemplify the dependability of His promises
and performance? Ps. 148:5, 6; Jer. 31:35, 36; 33:20, 25, 26.

   Noia.—The laws of God in nature are equally enduring with His promises.
The Creator is not capricious. He does all things in a constant and dependable
fashion through the laws which. He has established in nature. "God does not
annul His laws, or work contrary to them; but He is continually using them
as His instruments."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 114.
   4. How is man's inability to interfere with the laws of nature
set forth in the Bible? Job 38:31-33; 37:12; Matt. 5:36.
                                         [ 29
    NOTE.—"The beneficent operations of nature are not accomplished by
abrupt and startling interpositions; men are not permitted to take her work
into their own hands. God works through the calm regular operation of His
appointed laws."—Testimonies to Ministers, page 190.
   "By the laws of God in nature, effect follows cause with unvarying cer-
tainty. The reaping testifies to the sowing. Here no pretense is tolerated.
Men may deceive their fellow men. . . . But in nature there can be no
deception. . . . And in the highest sense this is true also in the spiritual
realm. . . . The harvest of life is character, and it is this that determines
destiny, both for this life and for the life to come."—Education, pages 108, 109.
   5. What moral responsibility rests upon man, seeing that it is
possible for him to understand the laws of the natural world? Rom.
1:20, 21, 25.

   NOTE.—"The laws of nature are obeyed by nature. . . . And can it be
that man, made in the image of God, endowed with reason and speech, shall
alone be unappreciative of His gifts and disobedient to His will?"—Christ's
Object Lessons, pages 81, 82.
                        Creation, Not Evolution

   6. How much of the creative organization of the earth was
completed at the end of its first week? Is creation a present-day
process? Gen. 2:1; Ex. 20:11; Heb. 4:3, last clause.

   7. What prediction was made through the apostle Peter con-
cerning certain erroneous teachings that should be developed "in
the last days"? 2 Peter 3:3, 4.

    NoTE.—It is significant that evolutionistic doctrine is uniformitarian,
claiming that creation is a continuous process of both past and present, and
that "all things continue as . . . from the beginning of the creation," not as
from the end of it. Such teaching is in direct contradiction of the Scriptural
doctrine that, within the limits of minor variations permissible under God's
laws in nature, and subject to His occasional miraculous intervention as at the
Deluge and other lesser occasions, all things continue as from the end of a
finished creation. The Sabbath is a sign to' the world that there are
believers in a completed six-day creative act by the Almighty, and that, so
far as this world is concerned, no new creation has since taken place. Often
science is confused with the belief and teachings of scientists. A scientist is a
student and interpreter of science, and he may as readily be correct or in
error as may a historian or a theologian. True science is dependable ; some
scientists may be in error.
  8. How does Paul indicate that all that is called "science" is not
necessarily true? 1 Tim. 6:20, 21.

   9. What is the Biblical explanation of the origin of matter and
of living things? Heb. 11:3; Ps. 33:9; 100:3; 148:5.
                                     [ 30 ]
    NOTE.—The Bible presents a Creator who made material where no material
existed previously, and affirms that what is came from what was not. Evo-
lutionistic philosophy commonly makes no attempt to explain the origin of
matter; in fact, it evades the issue by such a dense screen of theories concern-
ing how what is came from what was previously existent that most persons
are deceived into thinking that it answers fully the question of ultimate
origins. Further, having assumed matter already existent at the outset, such
philosophy fails to show how purposeful and successful design in multitu-
dinous creatures could be developed through random chance in and by
unthinking matter. The unique and marvelous design manifested through-
out the natural world points unmistakably to a great Designer and Creator.

   10. What does the Bible teach concerning the forming of
mountains and valleys? Ps. 104:8. "The mountains rose, the val-
leys sank down," A.R.V.

    NoTE.—Had the materials in the rocks of the earth been left undisturbed
and to themselves, there would now be nothing else than a homogeneous mix-
ture of earthy materials everywhere. No mountain or hill could ever have
arisen of its own accord above the level of the overlying water. Present
influences are leveling the land into the depressions of the seas, not upbuild-
ing land areas. The fact that there are elevated continents, with still more
elevated mountains, which are continually being eroded and degraded to lower
levels, is abundant evidence that some influence other than those at present
active must have produced these elevated and depressed regions. Creation
was•something extraordinary, as was also the subsequent Deluge.
    One phase of modern evolutionism teaches that some areas are heavier
or more dense than others, and that consequently the heavier valley regions
pushed up the lighter mountains. Such teaching fails to explain the cause
of any such initial difference or of any present difference in weight of various
parts of the earth. Only an almighty Creator could be responsible for pro-
 ducing not only the material of the earth itself, but also its diversified physio-
graphical features; the very earth testifies that "in all these . . . the hand
 of the Lord bath wrought this."

          Importance of Nature Study in the Last Days
   11. What should be our attitude as we face the challenge of the
mysteries of God's created works? Job 38:1-4, 12, 18, 21, 36; 40:
3-5; 42:1-3, 5, 6.

  12. In the world-wide everlasting gospel message, to whom is
worship directed? Rev. 14:6, 7.

    NOTE.—"To make plain natural law, and urge the obedience of it, is the
work that accompanies the third angel's message to prepare a people for the
coming of the Lord."—Testimonies, vol. 3, p. 161.
    "Show that the laws of nature, being the.laws of God, are designed for
our 'good; that obedience to them promotes happiness in this life, and aids
in the preparation for the life to come."—The Ministry of Healing, page 146.

                    Lesson 11, for December 15, 1951
    The Earth Desolated and Purified With Fire
    MEMORY VERSE: "But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same
word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of
ungodly men." 2 Peter 3:7.
    STUDY HELPS: "The Creator and His Workshop," chapter 24; "The Great
Controversy," pages 653-661, 672-674 (new ed., pp. 735-743; 755-757) ; "The Story of
Redemption," pages 415-429.
    INTRODUCTION: "At the coming of Christ the wicked are blotted from the
face of the whole earth,—consumed with the spirit of His mouth, and destroyed by
the brightness of His glory. Christ takes His people to the city of God and the
earth is emptied of its inhabitants. . . . The whole earth appears like a desolate
wilderness." "Here is to be the home of Satan with his evil angels for a thousand years.
Limited to the earth, he will not have access to other worlds, to tempt and annoy those
who have never fallen." "At the close of the thousand years, Christ again returns to
the earth. . . . As He descends in terrific majesty, He bids the wicked dead arise to
receive their doom." "As the New Jerusalem, in its dazzling splendor, comes down
out of heaven, it rests upon the place purified and made ready to receive it, and Christ,
with His people and the angels, enters the Holy City." "Satan, the mightiest of war-
riors, leads the van, and his angels unite their forces for this final struggle. Kings and
warriors are in his train, and the multitudes follow in vast companies, each under its
appointed leader. . . . By command of Jesus, the gates of the New Jerusalem are
closed, and the armies of Satan surround the city, and make ready for the onset." "The
whole wicked world stand arraigned at the bar of God, on the charge of high treason
against the government of heaven. They have none to plead their cause; they are with-
out excuse; and the sentence of eternal death is pronounced against them." "Fire comes
down from God out of heaven. The earth is broken up. The weapons concealed•in its
depths are drawn forth. Devouring flames burst from every yawning chasm. The very
rocks are on fire. The day has come that shall burn as an oven. The elements melt
with fervent heat, the earth also, and the works that are therein are burned up. The
earth's surface seems one molten mass,—a vast, seething lake of fire. . . . The
wicked receive their recompense in the earth." "The fire that consumes the wicked
purifies the earth. Every trace of the curse is swept away."—"The Great Contro-
versy," pages 657, 659, 662-664, 668, 672-674.

                           The Earth as It Now Is
   1. How does the present condition of the earth compare with
that at the close of creation week? How will plant and animal life
be affected as the day of the Lord approaches? Isa. 33:9; 51:6; Joel
1:15-18.

    2. What is the condition, of the inhabitants of the earth? What
is the cause of this condition? Isa. 24:4-12.
                                          [ 32
  3. What prophecy did Christ make concerning the last days?
Matt. 24:37-39.

  4. What retribution was brought upon the earth because of
man's wickedness in the days of Noah? Gen. 7:23; 2 Peter 2:5.

   5. Since men have been persistently and increasingly disobedi-
ent, what is God's plan for the present wicked world? 2 Peter 3:7,
10, 12.

   6. What warnings have been given to God's people? 1 Thess.
5:2-4.
                 Destruction of the Earth
   7. What provision has been made for the righteous during the
time of the desolation and destruction of the earth? 1 Thess. 4:16,
17; Rev. 20:6; Isa. 33:13-16.

   8. After the close of the thousand years, what will be done to
the resurrected and still rebellious wicked? Rev. 20:5, 9, 15; 21:8;
Mal. 4:1.

   9. What will be the effect of the final fire upon the earth? Mal.
4:3; 2 Peter 3:10.

   NOTE.—As a material body the earth is not to disappear, for its substance
will "melt with fervent heat," and its works will "be burned up" to "ashes."
Burning does not annihilate matter, but does destroy all of its previous
form and organization. Samples of plant and animal life were preserved
through the Deluge, but nothing and no one except the redeemed in the
custody of their Redeemer will survive the world-wide destruction by fire.
   10. What will be the condition of the atmosphere? How will
the sun and moon be affected? Jer. 4:23, 28; Isa. 24:23.

   NOTE.—As was noted in the consideration of Genesis 1:2 and the inspired
commentary on creation from Job 38:4, 9, the sun was initially hidden by
dense clouds. Prior to the re-creation of the earth, it seems that an equally
dense darkness will envelop the earth and conceal its devastated surface.

   11. To what condition will the earth be returned? To what
other time does this compare? Jer. 4:23-27; Isa. 24:1, 3, 19. Com-
pare with the words of Genesis 1:2.

    12. In view of the imminence of the final judgment and destruc-
 tion, what solemn question is asked? 2 Peter 3:11, 12.

                    Lesson 12, for December 22, 1951

              The Restoration of the Dominion
    MEMORY VERSE: "And Thou, 0 Tower of the flock, the stronghold of the
daughter of Zion, unto Thee shall it come, even the first dominion; the kingdom shall
come to the daughter of Jerusalem." Micah 4:8.
    STUDY HELPS: "The Creator and His Workshop," chapter 25; "The Great
Controversy," pages 635-652, 673, 674 (new ed., pp. 717-733, 756, 757); "The Story
of Redemption," page 430; "Education," pages 301-309.
    INTRODUCTION: "The great plan of redemption results in fully bringing back
the world into God's favor. All that was lost by sin is restored. Not only man but the
earth is redeemed, to be the eternal abode of the obedient. For six thousand years, Satan
has struggled to maintain possession of the earth. Now God's original purpose in its
creation is accomplished. 'The saints of the Most High shall take the kingdom, and
possess the kingdom forever, even for ever and ever.' "—"Patriarchs and Prophets,"
page 342.
   "There shall be nothing to 'hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain, saith the Lord.'
There man will be restored to his lost kingship, and the lower order of beings will
again recognize his sway; the fierce will become gentle, and the timid trustful."—"Ed-
ucation," page 304.
    "After his expulsion from Eden, Adam's life on earth was filled with sorrow. . . .
Faithfully did he repent of his sin, and trust in the merits of the promised Saviour, and
he died in the hope of a resurrection. The Son of God redeemed man's failure and fall;
and now, through the work of the atonement, Adam is reinstated in his first dominion."

                                A New Creation
   1. After the complete destruction of all the organized natural
world, what re-creative work will be accomplished? Rev. 21:1;
Isa. 65:17, 18.

    NoTE.—It is again the creative Word that speaks into existence a new
creation from the same material of which the former one was made. This
difference, however, is noted: The original creation began with a sea of water
over the entire earth; the new heavens and new earth begin from a "lake of
fire."
   2. How much of the world will be involved in the new crea-
tion? Rev. 21:5; 2 Peter 3:13.

   3. To whom will the dominion of the earth be restored? Micah
4:8; Dan. 7:27.

                    Inhabitants of the New Earth

   4. How completely must mankind be perfected and re-created
in order to possess the restored dominion? Isa. 60:20, 21; Rev.
21:27; Ps. 15:1-4.

   5. To what extent must the mind and heart be purified for one
to become a partaker of the promises? 1 John 3:1-3; Rom. 12:2;
Phil. 2:5.

   NOTE.—"God does not compel men to give up their unbelief. Before them
are light and darkness, truth and error. It is for them to decide which they
will accept. The human mind is endowed with power to discriminate between
right and wrong. God designs that men shall not decide from impulse, but
from weight of evidence, carefully comparing scripture with scripture."—
The Desire of Ages, page 458.
   6. What should be our attitude toward the body in preparation
for the life to come? What will be the state of health of the
redeemed in the new earth? Rom. 12:1; 1 Cor. 3:17; 9:27; Isa. 33:24.

   NOTE.—Control of one's habits and physical being is equally important
with control of the mind. "The body is the only medium through.which the
mind and the soul are developed for the upbuilding of character. . . . The
kingly power of reason, sanctified by divine grace, is to bear sway in our lives.
   "The requirements of God must be brought home to the conscience. Men
and women must be awakened to the duty of self-mastery, the need of purity,
freedom from every depraving appetite and defiling habit. They need to be
impressed with the fact that all their powers of mind and body are the gift
of God, and are to be preserved in the best possible condition for His
service."—The Ministry of Healing, page 130.
   7. What life-giving food and drink will be provided for the
redeemed? Rev. 22:1, 2.

                       Man's Dominion Restored
   8. In the renewed state what will be the relation of the animal
world to man? How responsive will be the animals to man's
leadership? What sort of food will the animals eat? Isa. 11:6-9;
65:25.

   9. How will the prayer of Christ be fulfilled in the new-earth
state? John 17:24; Rev. 22:14.

   10. What significant term is used to indicate the status of the
redeemed? How does Peter refer to their inheritance? Rom. 8:17;
Gal. 3:29; 1 Peter 1:4.
                                     [ 35 ]
   NOTE.—"Restored to His presence, man will again, as at the beginning, be
taught of God." — Education, page 302.

   11. How long will the new earth endure? Under Christ, how
long will the saints have dominion over the earth? Eph. 3:21;
Dan. 7:27; Rev. 22:5; Isa. 66:22.

   NoTE.—"And the, years of eternity, as they roll, will bring richer and still
more glorious revelations of God and of Christ."—The Great Controversy,
page 678.
   12. How incomprehensible is the plan of redemption and of
restoration of the dominion? 1 Cor. 2:9, 10.

                   Lesson .13, for December 29, 1951

               The New Earth and Its Capital
    MEMORY VERSE: "Nevertheless we, according to His promise, look for new
heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness. Wherefore, beloved, seeing
that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of Him in peace, without
spot, and blameless." 2 Peter 3:13, 14.
    STUDY HELPS: "The Creator and His Workshop," chapter 26; "The Great
Controversy," pages 674-678 (new ed., pp. 758-762) ; "The Story of Redemption,"
pages 413, 414, 430-433; "Early Writings," pages 17-20; Revelation 21:1 to 22:5.
    INTRODUCTION: Ever since the expulsion of Adam and Eve from Eden,
God's faithful ones have "looked for a city which hath foundations, whose Builder and
Maker is God." They have yearned for the renewed earth in which "the desert shall
blossom as a rose," and from which extremes of all kinds will be absent. The Canaan
of rest toward which they have looked is not one of inactivity, but rather one of joyful
and restful satisfaction in performance, achievement, and participation in the results
of their sanctified desires and unwearied labors. Since "higher than the highest human
thought can reach is God's ideal for His children," the Creator has done infinitely more
than man could imagine or hope for "to prepare a place" for the redeemed. A glimpse
of that better world, the eternal home of the adopted sons of God (Rom. 8:23) may be
obtained from comparison with the perfection of the original creation and from a study
of the prophetic descriptions given by Isaiah, John, and other inspired writers. "Lan-
guage is altogether too feeble to attempt a description of heaven."—"The Story of
Redemption," page 414.

                  Physical Features of the New Earth
    1. In what respect will physical features of the new earth cor-
respond to those of the original creation? How real is the new
earth to be? Zech. 14:8, 9; Joel 3:18; Rev. 22:1. Compare Gen. 2:10.
                                        [36 7
    NarE.—"A fear of making the future inheritance seem too material has
led many to spiritualize away the very truths which lead us to look upon
it as. our home."—The Great Controversy, pages 674, 675. Through faith,
"the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen," Abraham
"looked for a city which hath foundations," and in vision the prophet John
saw such a city with foundations of substantial precious minerals. Rev. 21:19,
20.
  2. What indications are given concerning highways? Isa. 35:
8,9.

   3. How extensively will vegetation cover the earth? How will
the animals and plants compare with those of the present? Ezek.
34:25-27; Isa. 11:6-9; 55:13; 41:18, 19.

   4. In what activities will the redeemed engage? Isa. 65:21, 22.

    NorE.—"There every power will be developed, every capability increased.
The grandest enterprises will be carried forward, the loftiest aspirations will
be reached, the highest ambitions realized. And still there will arise new
heights to surmount, new wonders to admire, new truths to comprehend,
fresh objects to call forth the powers of body and mind and soul."—Educa-
tion, page 307.
  5. What besides ideal rural surroundings has God provided?
Heb. 11:16, 10.

                  The Capital City, New Jerusalem
   6. How large will be the New Jerusalem? Of what materials
will its walls, gates, and streets be composed? Rev. 21:10-12, 16-21.

   NorE.—The most reliable estimates of the length of the Roman furlong,
which was in use in the days when John wrote the Revelation, would make
the circumference of the city about 1,320 miles, or 330 miles on each side.
The area would be nearly 110,000 square miles, or approximately the size of
such a state as Arizona, Colorado, or Nevada.

   7. What will be the source of the river of life? Where will the
tree of life be located? Rev. 22:1, 2; Ps. 46:4.

     lished each quarter in the Braille and supplied free to the blind
     upon request. Address: The Christian Record Benevolent Associa-
     tion, Box 66, Lincoln 6, Nebraska.

                                     [ 37 ]
  8. How is the city to be illuminated? What change will be
made in the sun and moon? Rev. 21:23, 25; Isa. 60:19, 20; 30:26.


    NorE.—Though to the more distinct restored vision of redeemed man
the sun and the moon will appear much more intense than now, to the
dwellers in the city of God the brilliance of these light bearers will be insig-
nificant in comparison with the light of the glory of God. Thus, while the
sun and the moon will continue to shine with their accustomed brilliance
upon the new earth as well as upon the unfallen planets, "the city had no
need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it."
                      Worship in the New Earth
   9. How frequently will all the redeemed meet for worship and
devotion together? Isa. 66:23, 20.


   10. What choirs and choruses will be heard? What will be the
theme of the songs rendered? How many will join in the response?
Rev. 5:8-10; 13; 14:1-3; Ps. 87:7.

   NoTE.—"As Jesus opens before them the riches of redemption, and the
amazing achievements in the great controversy with Satan, the hearts of the
ransomed thrill with more fervent devotion, and with more rapturous joy
they sweep the harps of gold; and ten thousand times ten thousand and
thousands of thousands of voices unite to swell the mighty chorus of praise."
—The Great Controversy, page 678.
  11. What recognition will finally be accorded the Creator?
Rev. 21:3; 22:3.

   12. How many are invited to share in the privileges and bless-
ings of the new earth? Rev. 22:17.

      THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
         December 29, 1951—Inter-American Division
    The Thirteenth Sabbath Offering overflow at the end of the third quarter
of 1949 amounted to $40,542.81. This splendid sum of money went to the
Inter-American Division to help to strengthen the work of three different
projects; namely, the Indian work in South Mexico and Guatemala, the
sanitarium-hospital enterprise in Puerto Rico, and the building of chapels in
the French West Indies.
    The overflow from the offering received on December 29 this year will go
for two worthy projects in Inter-America—helping to replace some of the old
buildings of the West Indian Training College at Mandeville, Jamaica, and
adding a surgical wing to the Montemorelos Hospital in Mexico. The school
at Mandeville has been a great influence for good in training young people to
be workers in that territory, but the old buildings are falling apart, and unless
repairs and replacements are made the school must soon cease to function.
The need for a place to care for surgical patients at Montemorelos is equally
urgent. Let us exceed the offering overflow that was given to Inter-America
in 1949 by making this the greatest Thirteenth Sabbath Offering in the history
of the Sabbath school.
