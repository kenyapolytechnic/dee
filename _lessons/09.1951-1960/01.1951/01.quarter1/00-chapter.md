                       Lesson 1, for January 6, 1951

                          The Fall of Empires
   MEMORY VERSE: "We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye
do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day
dawn, and the daystar arise in your hearts." 2 Peter 1:19.

Lights of Prophecy," pages 43-51.
                          DAILY STUDY ASSIGNMENT
I. General survey.                 5. Read part of study-help assignment.
2. Questions 1-5.                  6. Read remainder of study-help assign-
3. Questions 6-10.                      ment.
4. Questions 11-15.                7. Review.

                         The Certainty of Prophecy
  1. What declaration does God make regarding His foreknowl-
edge and His power? Isa. 46:9, 10.

    NOTE.—"The history which the great I AM has marked out in His word,
uniting link after link in the prophetic chain, from eternity in the past to
eternity in the future, tells us where we are today in the procession of the
ages, and what may be expected in the time to come. All that prophecy has
foretold as coming to pass, until the present time, has been traced on the pages
of history, and we may be assured that all which is yet to come will be ful-
filled in its order."—Education, page 178.
  2. In the midst of the turmoil and uncertainty of these times,
what sure guide is given us? 2 Peter 1:19.

                      The Rise and Fall of Civilizations
   3. On what period of time did the dream of Nebuchadnezzar,
king of Babylon, focus? Dan. 2:28.

   4. What is represented by the head of gold? Dan. 2:36-38.

    NcrrE.—"It was the golden kingdom of a golden age. Babylon, its metrop-
olis, towered to a height never reached by any of its successors. . . . This
city, containing in itself many things which were themselves wonders of the
world, was itself another and still mightier wonder."—Daniel and the Reve-
lation, pages 42, 43.
                                         [3 ]
  5. Why did this marvelous civilization fall, and how complete
was its ruin? Dan. 5:22-28; Isa. 13:19-22.

   NOTE.—"Today scarcely enough even of the ruins is left to mark the spot
where once stood the largest, richest, and proudest city of the ancient world.
Thus the ruin of great Babylon shows us how accurately God fulfills His word,
and makes the doubts of skepticism appear like willful blindness."—Daniel
and the Revelation, page 49.
   6. How are the second and third kingdoms designated? Dan.
2:39.

   7. How does the record of Paul's visit to Athens give the key to
the downfall of Grecia? Acts 17:16.

    NoTE.—Grecian architecture is copied by our builders. Solon has be-
queathed his name to modern lawyers. The speeches of her orators, and the
writings of her wise men are classics in our halls of learning. Her high physical
development is memorialized in our Olympic games. The impress of her art
stands out in the sculpture of Western civilization. Her philosophers soared
to the fog-covered peaks of intellectualism. But they all left God out of their
thoughts, and their sculpture and literature reveal the moral impotency that
brought the downfall of another great civilization.
   8. What description of conditions in the iron monarchy of Rome
accounts for the disintegration of that powerful empire? Dan. 2:40;
Rom. 1:21-32.

   9. Why did these kingdoms fall? Ps. 9:17.

                             A Divided World
   10. Referring to the kingdoms suggested by the ten toes of the
image, what divine prediction describes the hopeless division of
the nations? Dan. 2:41-43.

    NOTE.—The breakup of Rome into ten kingdoms was completed in A.D. 476.
Time and again during the more than fourteen centuries which have followed,
men have endeavored to weld the nations of Europe into one great empire.
Charlemagne tried it. Charles V tried it. Louis XIV tried it. Napoleon tried
it. Kaiser Wilhelm tried it. Hitler tried it. The League of Nations tried to
get the nations to pull together. The United Nations is trying to do it. God's
seven words still stand, "They shall not cleave one to another."

   11. What conditions are to be expected in the last days, judging
from the changes from nation to nation as indicated in the image?
Dan. 2:35, 45.
                                      [4]
                The Setting Up of Christ's Kingdom
    12. What is represented by the stone which smote the image on
its feet? Dan. 2:34, 44; Matt. 21:42, 44; Ps. 2:7-9.

    NOTE.—"So it will be in the great final day, when judgment shall fall upon
the rejectors of God's grace. Christ, their rock of offense, will then appear to
them as an avenging mountain. The glory of His countenance, which to the
righteous is life, will be to the wicked a consuming fire. Because of love
rejected, grace despised, the sinner will be destroyed."—The Desire of Ages,
page 600.
   13. In connection with what great event does the smiting of
the nations occur? Rev. 19:11-16; Isa. 11:4.

   14. What is the significance of the stone's becoming a great
mountain filling the whole earth? Dan. 2:35 (last part), 44; Isa.
11:9.

    NoTE.—"In the days of these kings the God of heaven is to set up a king-
dom. We have been in the days of these kings for many centuries, and we are
still in their days. So far as this prophecy is concerned, the very next event
is the setting up of God's everlasting kingdom."—Daniel and the Revelation,
page 65.
   15. How only are men prepared for a home in that kingdom?
John 3:3-5.

   N0TE.—"When the Spirit of God takes possession of the heart, it trans-
forms the life. Sinful thoughts are put away, evil deeds are renounced; love,
humility, and peace take the place of anger, envy, and strife. Joy takes the
place of sadness, and the countenance reflects the light of heaven. No one
sees the hand that lifts the burden, or beholds the light descend from the
courts above. The blessing comes when by faith the soul surrenders itself to
God. Then that power which no human eye can see creates a new being in
the image of God. . . . The beginning of redemption we may know here
through a personal experience. Its results reach through the eternal ages."—
The Desire of Ages, page 173.                                          •


                     Lesson 2, for January 13, 1951

                             Last-Day Signs
   MEMORY VERSE: "Take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be
overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day
come upon you unawares." Luke 21:34.

                          DAILY STUDY ASSIGNMENT
     1.   General survey.             5. Questions 13, 14.
     2.   Questions 1-5.             6. Read study help.
     3.   Questions 6-9.              7. Review.
     4.   Questions 10-12.


                           Signs in the Heavens
   1. Give terms used in Holy Scripture to designate the final period
of earth's history. Dan. 12:4; Matt. 13:39; 2 Tim. 3:1.

   2. What definite questions did His disciples put to Jesus pri-
vately? Matt. 24:3.

   3. What direct answer was given? Luke 21:11, 25.

4. How did our Lord describe the first great sign in the heavens?
When did it occur? Matt. 24:29; Rev. 6:12; Mark 13:24.

   NoTE.—"The nineteenth of May, 1780, was a remarkably dark day. Candles
were lighted in many houses. The birds were silent, and disappeared. The
fowls retired to roost. It was the general opinion that the day of judgment
was at hand. The legislature of Connecticut was in session at Hartford, but
being unable to transact business, adjourned."—President Timothy Dwight of
Yale, in Historical Collections, 2d ed., 1836, p..403.
   5. What was the next great sign, and when was it given? Matt.
24:29; Rev. 6:13.

    "Many who witnessed the falling of the stars, looked upon it as a herald of
the coming judgment,—`an awful type, a sure forerunner, a merciful sign, of
that great and dreadful day.' Thus the attention of the people was directed
to the fulfillment of prophecy, and many were led to give heed to the warning
of the second advent."—The Great Controversy, page 334.

                            Signs in the Earth
   6. With what two other periods of time does Jesus compare the
last days? Luke 17:26-30.

  7. How do the Scriptures describe conditions in Noah's day?
Gen. 6:5, 11-13.

    NoTE.—"The spirit of anarchy is permeating all nations, and the outbreaks
that from time to time excite the horror of the world are but indications of
the pent-up fires of passion and lawlessness that, having once escaped control,
will fill the earth with woe and desolation. The picture which inspiration has
given of the antediluvian world, represents too truly the condition to which
                                       6
modern society is fast hastening. Even now, in the present century, and in
professedly Christian lands, there are crimes daily perpetrated, as black and
terrible as those for which the old-world sinners were destroyed."—Patriarchs
and Prophets, page 102.
   8. Describe the conditions in Sodom and Gomorrah at the time
of their destruction. Gen. 18:20, 32; Ezek. 16:49, 50; Jude 7.

   9. What conditions in the religious world contribute to the
perils of the last days? 2 Tim. 3:1-5.

     NorE.—"We may believe that the name of Jesus is the only name under
heaven whereby man may be saved, and yet we may not through faith make
Him our personal Saviour. It is not enough to believe the theory of truth.
It is not enough to make a profession of faith in Christ and have our names
registered on the church roll. 'He that keepeth His commandments dwelleth
in Him, and He in him. And hereby we know that He abideth in us, by the
Spirit which He hath given us.' Hereby we do know that we know Him,
if we keep His commandments.' This is the genuine evidence of conversion.
Whatever our profession, it amounts to nothing unless Christ is revealed in
works of righteousness."—Christ's Object Lessons, pages 312, 313.
   10. What will be the attitude toward the teachings of the word
of God? 2 Tim. 4:3, 4.

    NOTE.—"There is cause for alarm in the condition of the religious world
today. God's mercy has been trifled with. The multitude make void the law
of Jehovah, 'teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.' Infidelity
prevails in many of the churches in our land; not infidelity in its broadest
sense,—an open denial of the Bible,—but an infidelity that is robed in the garb
of Christianity, while it is undermining faith in the Bible as a revelation from
God. Fervent devotion and vital piety have given place to hollow formalism.
As the result apostasy and sensualism prevail."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
page 166.
                        The Hope of the World
   11. How does James describe the results of human greed and
selfishness in the last days? James 5:1-5.

   NoTE.—"There are not many, even among educators and statesmen, who
comprehend the causes that underlie the present state of society. Those who
hold the reins of government are not able to solve the problem of moral
corruption, poverty, pauperism, and increasing crime. They are struggling
in vain to place business operations on a more secure basis."—Testimonies,
vol. 9, p. 13.
   12. When conditions get beyond human remedy, what is the
only hope of the world? Luke 21:25-28; James 5:7, 8; Titus 2:
11-13.
                                      [7]
  13. As we see the fast fulfilling signs, what are we to know?
Luke 21:29-33.

    NOTE.—"Though no man knoweth the day nor the hour of His coming,
we are instructed and required to know when it is near. We are further
taught that to disregard His warning, and refuse or neglect to know when
His advent is near, will be as fatal for us as it was for those who lived in the
days of Noah not to know when the Flood was coming. And the parable in
the same chapter, contrasting the faithful and the unfaithful servant, and
giving the doom of him who said in his heart, 'My Lord delayeth His
coming,' shows in what light Christ will regard and reward those whom He
finds watching, and teaching His coming, and those denying it."—The Great
Controversy, page 371.
   14. What should be our attitude in this solemn hour? Luke 21:
34-36.

   NOTE.—"As the time of their probation was closing, the antediluvians gave
themselves up to exciting amusements and festivities. .. . Do we not see the
same repeated in our day? While God's servants are giving the message that
the end of all things is at hand, the world is absorbed in amusements and
pleasure seeking. There is a constant round of excitement that causes indiffer-
ence to God, and prevents the people from being impressed by the truths
which alone can save them from the coming destruction."—Patriarchs and
Prophets, page 103.


                      Lesson 3, for January 20, 1951

                         A Last-Day Message
    MEMORY VERSE: "Seeing then that we have a great High Priest, that is
passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession." Hebrews
4:14.
    STUDY HELPS: "The Great Controversy," pages 324-329, 409-432 (new ed.,
pp. 370-376, 467-481) ; "Beacon Lights of Prophecy," pages 91-107.
                          DAILY STUDY ASSIGNMENT
     1.   General survey.            5. Read from "The Great Controversy."
     2.   Questions 1-5.             6. Read from "Beacon Lights of Proph-
     3.   Questions 6-9.                  ecy."
     4.   Questions 10-13.           7. Review.

                 God's Judgments Foretold
   1. What fundamental principle always governs God's dealings
with mankind? Amos 3:7.

  2. What examples does the Bible give of this fact? Heb. 11:7;
Gen. 18:17; 19:14; Matt. 3:1-3.
                              [8]
   3. If God sent a message foretelling the judgment of a single
city, may we look for a special warning message as the doom of
the whole world approaches? Joel 2:1, 2; Zeph. 2:1-3; Mal. 4:5, 6.

    NoTE.—"When the judgment of the great day shall come, when Christ
shall appear King of kings and Lord of lords, when the dead shall be raised,
when the world shall end, and all things earthly shall be closed up, how
vastly more important will this event be than all others! In this grand event
all will have an interest, both the living and the dead, from Adam to the last
child born. Before this grand and awful event all others sink into insignifi-
cance. Shall, then, such an event as this come upon the people of God and
upon the world, and God's servants know nothing about it, and the world be
unwarned concerning it?"—Present Truth (tract), page 9.
   4. How widely will this message be proclaimed? Matt. 24:14.

                                     The Hour of God's Judgment
   5. What prophecy forms the basis of the judgment-hour mes-
sage? Dan. 8:13, 14.

   6. In symbolic prophecy, what does a day represent? Num.
14:34; Ezek. 4:6.

   7. When did the 2300 year-days begin and end? Dan. 9:25;
Ezra 7:9-14.

    NoTE.—"The 2300 days had been found to begin when the commandment
of Artaxerxes for the restoration and building of Jerusalem, went into effect,
in the autumn of 457 a.c."—The Great Controversy, page 410.

                                                       THE 2300 DAYS
    8. What outstanding events check the accuracy of the interpre-
tation? Dan. 9:25-27.

   NoTE.—"From this date, 483 years extend to the autumn of A.D. 27. At
that time this prophecy was fulfilled. The word 'Messiah' signifies 'the
Anointed One.' In the autumn of A.D. 27, Christ was baptized by John, and
received the anointing of the Spirit. . . . 'In the midst of the week He shall
cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease.' In A.D. 31, three and a half years
                                       [9]
after His baptism, our Lord was crucified. With the great sacrifice offered
upon Calvary, ended that system of offerings which for four thousand years
had pointed forward to the Lamb of God."—The Great Controversy, pages
327, 328.
                   The Cleansing of the Sanctuary
   9. To what sanctuary does the prophecy refer? Heb. 8:1, 2; 9:23.

    NoTE.—"The 'true tabernacle' in heaven is the sanctuary of the new cove-
nant. And as the prophecy of Daniel 8:14 is fulfilled in this dispensation, the
sanctuary to which it refers must be the sanctuary of the new covenant. At
the termination of the 2300 days, in 1844, there had been no sanctuary on
earth for many centuries. Thus the prophecy, 'Unto two thousand and three
hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed,' unquestionably points to
the sanctuary in heaven."—The Great Controversy, page 417.
   10. In the typical service what did the cleansing of the sanc-
tuary signify? Lev. 16:15-19; 23:26-30.

    NOTE.—"As anciently the sins of the people were by faith placed upon the
sin offering, and through its blood transferred, in figure, to the earthly sanc-
tuary; so in the new covenant the sins of the repentant are by faith placed
upon Christ, and transferred, in fact, to the heavenly sanctuary. And as the
typical cleansing of the earthly was accomplished by the removal of the sins
by which it had been polluted, so the actual cleansing of the heavenly is to
be accomplished by the removal, or blotting out, of the sins which are there
recorded. But before this can be accomplished, there must be an examination
of the books of record to determine who, through repentance of sin and faith
in Christ, are entitled to the benefits of His atonement. The cleansing of the
sanctuary therefore involves a work of investigation,—a work of judgment."
—The Great Controversy, pages 421, 422.
  11. In heaven what event marked the close of the 2300 days?
Heb 9:6, 7, 23, 24; Rev. 11:19.

   NorE.—"The announcement that the temple of God was opened in heaven,
and the ark of His testament was seen, points to the opening of the most holy
place of the heavenly sanctuary, in 1844, as Christ entered there to perform
the closing work of the atonement."—The Great Controversy, page 433.
  12. What divinely inspired message was sounded at that time?
Rev. 7:1-3; 10:1-7; 14:6-11.

  13. What result follows this proclamation of the judgment-hour
message to all the world? Rev. 14:12.

   NoTE.—"Necessarily, the message of the judgment hour must call men to
loyalty to God's holy law. That law is the standard of the judgment. Every
man must meet it there, before the bar of Eternal Justice....
   "The whole controversy between truth and error is waged over loyalty to
                                   [ 10]
God. His law is the foundation of His government, even as an earthly govern-
ment is founded upon its laws. The great apostasy has arisen that was to
`think to change' the holy law of God. Dan. 7:25. Now, with the judgment
hour at hand, soon to pass upon all living, the gospel message for the time
calls men to loyalty to the living God. And at its call, in all the world, the
people of the prophecy are springing up, keeping 'the commandments of God,
and the faith of Jesus.' "—W. A. Spicer, Beacon Lights of Prophecy, pages
315, 316.

                          DAILY STUDY ASSIGNMENT
     1.   General survey.             5. Read from "The Great Contro-
     2.   Questions 1-4.                   versy."
     3.   Questions 5-9.             6. Read from "Testimonies,"
     4.   Questions 10-14.                 volume 4.
                                      7. Review.

                         The Judgment in Session
  1. In the certainty of what event does Paul call men to repent-
ance? Acts 17:31; 24:25.

   2. With whom will the judgment begin? 1 Peter 4:17.

    NOTE.—"In the typical service, only those who had come before God with
confession and repentance, and whose sins, through the blood of the sin-offer-
ing, were transferred to the sanctuary, had a part in the service of the Day
of Atonement. So in the great day of final atonement and investigative judg-
ment, the only cases considered are those of the professed people of God. The
judgment of the wicked is a distinct and separate work, and takes place at
a later period."—The Great Controversy, page 480.
    3. Who will be the judge? Dan. 7:9, 10; Ps. 50:6.

   4. By what standard of conduct will all be judged? Eccl. 12:13,
14; James 2:10-12.

    NOTE.—"That men may be prepared to stand in the judgment, the message
commands them to 'fear God, and give glory to Him,' and worship Him that
made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.' The result
of an acceptance of these messages is given in the words, 'Here are they that
                                   [11 1
keep the commandments of God, and the faith of. Jesus.' In order to be pre-
pared for the judgment, it is necessary that men should keep the law of God.
That law will be the standard of character in the judgment. The apostle Paul
declares, 'As many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law, . .
in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ.' And He
says that `the doers of the law shall be justified.' Faith is essential in order
to the keeping of the law of God; for 'without faith it is impossible to please
Him.' "—The Great Controversy, page 436.
   5. On what evidence will the decisions be based? Dan. 7:10;
Isa. 65:6, 7; Mal. 3:16; Rev. 20:12.

    NorE.—A book of remembrance is written before God, in which are re-
corded the good deeds of "them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon
His name."
    "There is a record also of the sins of men. . . . Opposite each name in
the books of heaven is entered, with terrible exactness, every wrong word,
every selfish act, every unfulfilled duty, and every secret sin, with every
artful dissembling. Heaven-sent warnings or reproofs neglected, wasted mo-
ments, unimproved opportunities, the influence exerted for good or for evil,
with its far-reaching results, all are chronicled by the recording angel."—The
Great Controve6; pages 481, 482.
   6. By whom art. `he records kept? Eccl. 5:6; Dan. 4:13, 17.

    NorE.—"Could the veil which separates the visible from the invisible
world be swept back, and the children of men behold an angel recording every
word and deed, which they must meet again in the judgment, how many words
that are daily uttered would remain unspoken; how many deeds would remain
undone."—The Great Controversy, page 487.

                            Tire Book of, Life
  7. Whose names are recorded in the book of life? Luke 10:20;
Phil. 4:3; Rev. 13:8; 21:27.

    NOTE.—"The book of life contains the names of all who have ever entered
the service of God."—The Great Controversy, page 480.
   8. What part does Jesus take in the judgment? 1 John 2:1; Heb.
7:25; Matt. 10:32, 33.

   9. When one's name comes up in the judgment, what will be
the result if sin has not been confessed and put away? Ex. 32:33;
Ezek. 18:24.

  10. What will be the result where every sin has been pardoned
and overcome? Acts 3:19-21; Isa. 43:25; Rev. 3:5.
                                     [ 12 I
   NcrrE.—"All who have truly repented of sin, and by faith claimed the
blood of Christ as their atoning sacrifice, have had pardon entered against
their names in the books of heaven; as they have become partakers of the
righteousness of Christ, and their characters are found to be in harmony with
the law of God, their sins will be blotted out, and they themselves will be
accounted worthy of eternal life."—The Great Controversy, page 483.
   11. What importance is attached to having the name retained
in the book of life? Rev. 20:15; Dan. 12:1.

  12. How searching will be the test of the judgment? Eccl. 12:14;
Rom. 2:16; Matt. 12:36, 37.

  13. What decree will go forth at the close of the judgment?
Rev. 22:11, 12.

    NOTE.—"Perilous is the condition of those who, growing weary of their
watch, turh to the attractions of the world. While the man of business is
absorbed in the pursuit of gain, while the pleasure lover is seeking indulgence,
while the daughter of fashion is arranging her adornments,—it may be in that
hour the Judge of all the earth will pronounce the sentence, 'Thou art weighed
in the balances, and art found wanting.' "—The Great Controversy, page 491.
   14. What should be our constant prayer? Ps. 139:23, 24.

    NOTE.—"How solemn is the thought! Day after day, passing into eternity,
bears its burden of records for the books of heaven. Words once spoken, deeds
once done, can never be recalled. Angels have registered both the good and
the evil. The mightiest conqueror upon the earth cannot call back the record
of even a single day. Our acts, our words, even our most secret motives, all
have their weight in deciding our destiny for weal or Woe. Though they may _
be forgotten by us, they will bear their testimony to justify or to condemn."
—The Great Controversy, pages 486, 487.

                             False Teachers
   1. Against what last-day movements is special warning given?
1 Tim. 4:1, 2.

  2. In the judgment day what will many say who profess to work
miracles, in the name of Christ? Why had they been deceived?
Matt. 7:21-23; 2 Thess. 2:10-12.

   NOTE.—"Before the final visitation of God's judgments upon the earth,
there will be, among the people of the Lord, such a revival of primitive godli-
ness as has not been witnessed since apostolic times. . . . The enemy of souls
desires to hinder this work; and before the time for such a movement shall
come, he will endeavor to prevent it, by introducing a counterfeit. In those
churches which he can bring under his deceptive power, he will make it appear
that God's special blessing is poured out; there will be manifest what is
thought to be great religious interest. Multitudes will exult that God is work-
ing marvelously for them, when the work is that of another spirit. Under a
religious guise, Satan will seek to extend his influence over the Christian
world."—The Great Controversy, page 464.

                                 Spiritism
   3. What directions were given to ancient Israel concerning
spirit mediums and all their kind? Lev. 19:31; 20:27; Deut. 18:9-13.

     Nora.—"There are few who have any just conception of the deceptive
power of spiritualism and the danger of coming under its influence. Many
tamper with it, merely to gratify their curiosity. They have no real faith in
it, and would be filled.•with horror at the thought of yielding themselves to
the spirits' control. But they venture upon the forbidden ground, and the
mighty destroyer exercises his power upon them against their will."—The
Great Controversy, page 558.
   4. With whom do spirit mediums claim to communicate? 1 Sam.
28:11, 12.

   NOTE.—"It was not God's holy prophet that came forth at the spell of a
sorcerer's incantation. Samuel was not present in that haunt of evil spirits.
That supernatural appearance was produced solely by the power of Satan.
He could as easily assume the form of Samuel as he could assume that of an
angel of light, when he tempted Christ in the wilderness."—Patriarchs and
Prophets, page 679.
   5. Why cannot the dead return to communicate with the living?
Ps. 146:3, 4; Eccl. 9:5, 6,10.

   6. What spirits deceive the nations? Rev. 16:13, 14.
                              [ 14 ]
    NOTE.—"These visitants will appeal to our tenderest sympathies, and will
 work miracles to sustain their pretensions. We must be prepared to withstand
 them with the Bible truth that the dead know not anything, and that they
 who thus appear are the spirits of devils."—The Great Controversy, page 560.
    7. Whence came these evil spirits? What is their work? Rev.
12:7-9.
                         Satan's Crowning Act
  8. What form may we expect Satan's master deception to as-
sume? 2 Cor. 11:14.

   9. What supreme efforts will Satan put forth as he sees the end
 approaching? Rev. 12:12; 2 Thess. 2:9, 10.

     NOTE.—"It was by satanic aid that Pharaoh's magicians were enabled to
  counterfeit the work of God. Paul testifies that before the second advent of
  Christ there will be similar manifestations of satanic power. The coming of
  the Lord is to be preceded by 'the working of Satan with all power and signs
, and lying wonders, and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness.' "—The
  Great Controversy, page 553.
      10. How far will Satan go in impersonating Christ? Matt. 24:24.

     NOTE.—"As the crowning act in the great dr.ma of deception, Satan him-
 self will personate Christ. . . . The great deceiver will make it appear that
 Christ has come. In different parts of the earth, Satan will manifest himself
 among men as a majestic being of dazzling brightness, resembling the descrip-
 tion of the Son of God given by John in the Revelation. The glory that
 surrounds him is unsurpassed by anything that mortal eyes have yet beheld.
 The shout of triumph rings out upon the air, 'Christ has come l'"—The Great
 Controversy, page 624.
                    The Scriptures Our Safeguard
    11. How may the people of God distinguish between the coun-
 terfeit and the genuine appearing of Christ? Matt. 24:25-27.

     NOTE.—"So closely will the counterfeit resemble the true, that it will be
 impossible to distinguish between them except by the Holy Scriptures. . . .
 None but those who have fortified the mind with the truths of the Bible will
 stand through the last great conflict."—The Great Controversy, page 593.
     12. How only can we successfully contend with the forces of
 evil? Eph. 6:11-14.

    13. With what significant words will the saints greet their Lord
 at His coming? Isa. 25:9.

    14. What thrilling response will God's waiting people receive
 from their Redeemer? Luke 12:32.

                              Losing the First Love
  1. In the discourses on His second coming, what warning state-
ment does our Lord make? Matt. 24:12, 13.

   2. What will be the experience of many who profess to be look-
ing for the coming of the Lord? Matt. 24:48.

    NOTE.—" 'He [Satan] works upon minds to excite jealousy and dissatis-
faction toward those at the head of the work. The gifts are next questioned;
then, of course, they have but little weight, and instruction given through
vision is disregarded.' Next follows skepticism in regard to the vital points
of our faith, the pillars of our position, then doubt as to the Holy Scriptures,
and then the downward march to perdition.'"—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 672.
  3. In what way will the evil servant smite his fellow servants?
Matt. 24:49; James 3:5, 6; Prov. 16:28.

    NOTE.—"An earnest effort should be made in every church to put away
evilspeaking and a censorious spirit as among the sins productive of the great-
est evils in the church. Severity and faultfinding must be rebuked as the
workings of Satan. Mutual love and confidence must be encouraged and
strengthened in the members of the church. Let all, in the fear of God and
with love to their brethren, close their ears to gossip and censure."—Testi-
monies, vol. 5, p. 609.
   4. What is the result of strife in churches? James 3:14-16.

                             The Lusts of the Flesh
   5. What is the significance of eating and drinking with the
drunken? Matt. 24:38, 39; 1 John 2:15-17.
                              [ 16 ]
   NOTE.—"The crisis is stealing gradually upon us. . .. Men are still eating
and drinking, planting and building, marrying, and giving in marriage. . . .
Pleasure lovers are still crowding to theaters, horse races, gambling hells.
                                                               sing, and every
The highest excitement prevails, yet probation's hour is fast clo
case is about to be eternally decided. Satan sees that his time is short. He
has set all his agencies at work that men may be deceived, deluded, occupied
and entranced, until the day of probation shall be ended, and the door of
mercy be forever shut."—The Desire of Ages, page 636.
  6. What sin prevalent in Sodom and Gomorrah will cause the
downfall of, many in this degenerate age? Luke 17:28-30; Jude 7.

   NoTE.—"In all ages, temptations appealing to the physical nature have
been most effectual in corrupting and degrading mankind. Through intem-
perance, Satan works to destroy the mental and moral powers that God gave
to man as a priceless endowment. Thus it becomes impossible for men to
appreciate things of eternal worth. Through sensual indulgence, Satan seeks
to blot from the soul every trace of likeness to God....
   "His [Christ's] example declares that our only hope of eternal life is
through bringing the appetites and passions into subjection to the will of
God."—The Desire of Ages, page 122.
   7. How complete is our sanctification to be in preparation for
the coming of the Lord? 1 Thess. 5:23; Rom. 12:1.

   NOTE.—"Christians are bidden to present their bodies, 'a living sacrifice,
holy, acceptable unto God.' In order to do this, all their powers must be
preserved in the best possible condition. Every practice that weakens physi-
cal or mental strength unfits man for the service of his Creator. And will God
be pleased with anything less than the best we can offer? Said Christ, 'Thou
shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart.' Those who do love God
with all the heart will desire to give Him the best service of their life, and
they will be constantly seeking to bring every power of their being into har-
mony with the laws that will promote their ability to do His will. They will
not, by the indulgence of appetite or passion, enfeeble or defile the offering
which they present to their heavenly Father."—The Great Controversy, pages
473, 474.

                             Foolish Servants
  8. In the parable of the ten virgins what fatal mistake was made
by the foolish virgins? Matt. 25:8. See margin.

     NoTE,.—"The class represented by the foolish virgins are not hypocrites.
They have a regard for the truth, ... they are attracted to those who believe
the truth; but they have not yielded themselves to the Holy Spirit's working.
. . . The class represented by the foolish virgins have been content with a
superficial work. They do not know God.... Their service to God degener-
ates into a form."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 411.
  9. Against what trait of character are we especially warned?
Luke 12:15; Col. 3:5, last part.
                                     [17]
    NOTE.—"I saw that Satan bade his angels lay their snares especially for
those who were looking for Christ's second appearing and keeping all the
commandments of God. . . . 'Go, make the possessors of lands and money
drunk with cares. If you can make them place their affections upon these
things, we shall have them yet. They may profess what they please, only
make them care more for money than for the success of Christ's kingdom
or the spread of the truths we hate. Present the world before them in the
most attractive light, that they may love and idolize it.' "—Early Writings,
page 266.
    10. Why will the servant with one talent be r2jected in the day
of final reckoning? Matt. 25:25-30.

   NOTE.—"In the great judgment day those who have not worked for Christ,
those who have drifted along, carrying no responsibility, thinking of them-
selves, pleasing themselves, will be placed by the Judge of all the earth with
those who did evil. They receive the same condemnation."—Christ's Object
Lessons, page 365.
                                   Watch
  11. As we put on the whole armor of God, what must not be
neglected? Eph. 6:17, 18.

   NorE.—"Satan well knows that all whom he can lead to neglect prayer
and the searching of the Scriptures, will be overcome by his attacks. Therefore
he invents every possible device to engross the mind."—The Great Contro-
versy, page 519.
  12. What solemn admonition does our Lord address to those
who are looking for His coming? Mark 13:35-37.

   13. What reward is promised to those who are ready and watch-
ing? Matt. 24:45-47; 25:10.

    NOTE.—"The judgment is now passing in the sanctuary above. For many
years work has been in progress. Soon—none know how soon—it will pass
to the cases of the living. In the awful presence of God our lives are to come
up in review. At this time above all others it behooves every soul to heed the
Saviour's admonition, 'Watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.' "

                          The Great Controversy
   1. By what symbol does the revelator represent the church at
the beginning of the Christian Era? Rev. 12:1, 2; 2 Cor. 11:2.

   NOTE.—"The faithful ones, the church of the living God,—few as their
numbers may be, are represented as the 'woman clothed with the sun, and
the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.' It is
the closing of one era, the age of types and shadows, which, like the moon,
reflect the light of the true. The moon is under the feet of the church, and
the glorious sunrising of a new day is ushered in. The paler light of the moon
seems dim in that more glorious day. The types and ceremonies of the sanc-
tuary service, which had been a shadow of the real, were passing away; for
type met antitype in the Child that was born....
   "Around the head of the church clustered twelve stars, representing the
twelve apostles, who became the fathers of the Christian church, their names
are also on the twelve foundation stones of the New Jerusalem."—S. N.
Haskell, Story of the Seer of Patmos, pages 212, 213.
   2. What opposing power was symbolized by the red dragon
with seven heads and ten horns? Rev. 12:3.

    NOTE.—"The dragon is said to be Satan; he it was that moved upon Herod
to put the Saviour to death. But the chief agent of Satan in making war upon
Christ and His people during the first centuries of the Christian Era, was the
Roman Empire, in which paganism was the prevailing religion. Thus while
the dragon, primarily, represents Satan, it is, in a secondary sense, a symbol
of pagan Rome."—The Great Controversy, page 438.
  3. Who was the moving power back of the persecutions by
pagan Rome? Where did Satan's opposition to God and to His law
begin? Rev. 12:7-9.

                          The Papacy in Prophecy
    4. What power is represented by the beast of Revelation 13:1, 2?

   NOTE.—"This symbol, as most Protestants have believed, represents the
papacy, which succeeded to the power and seat and authority once held by
the ancient Roman Empire."—The Great Controversy, page 439.
   5. In what points does this beast correspond to the little horn
of Daniel 7? Dan. 7:8, 25; Rev. 13:5-7.

    6. How is the beast further identified? Rev. 13:18.
                                f19 ]
    NoTE.—"It is an evident reference to the ancient practice of designating
the name of a person by the numeral value of the letters in the name. . . .
    "The Douay (Catholic) Bible has a note on this eighteenth verse:
    " 'Six hundred sixty-six. The numeral letters of his name shall make up
this number.'
    "Applying this to an essential title of the pope, 'Vicar of the Son of God,'
spelled in Latin, which is the official language of this power that the prophecy
is dealing with, we see the numeral letters adding up as follows:

       VICARIVS FILII DEI
       5 - 1-100      1-5   1- 50 - 1 - 1 500 - 1 .   Total, 666."
                          —Beacon Lights of Prophecy, page 311.

   7. How was Daniel's prophecy fulfilled concerning the attempt
to change the times and law of God?

   ANSWER: "The Catholic Church for over one thousand years before the
existence of a Protestant, by virtue of her Divine Mission, changed the day
from Saturday to Sunday."—Catholic Mirror, Sept. 23, 1893.
    8. When and how was the deadly wound' (Rev. 13:3, 10) in-
flicted upon the papal head?

   ANSWER: "In the year 1798, Berthier, with a French army, entered Rome,
proclaimed a republic, took the pope prisoner, and inflicted a deadly wound
upon the papacy."—Daniel and the Revelation, page 145.

                    The United States in Prophecy
  9. At that very time, what nation symbolized by the beast with
two horns was seen coming upon the stage of action? Rev. 13:11.

    NOTE.—"The lamblike horns indicate youth, innocence, and gentleness,
fitly representing the character of the United States when presented to the
prophet as 'coming up' in 1798. Among the Christian exiles who first fled to
America, and sought an asylum from royal oppression and priestly intolerance,
were many who determined to establish a government upon the broad founda-
tion of civil and religious liberty. Their views found place in the Declaration
of Independence, which sets forth the great truth that 'all men are created
equal,' and endowed with the inalienable right to 'life, liberty, and the pur-
suit of happiness.' "—The Great Controversy, page 441.
   10. How does the revelator indicate that this nation will become
a persecuting power? Rev. 13:11, last clause.

   NoTE.="The 'speaking' of the nation is the action of its legislative and
judicial authorities. By such action it will give the lie to those liberal and
peaceful principles which it has put forth as the foundation of its policy.
                                     (20]
The prediction that it will speak 'as a dragon,' and exercise 'all the power of
the first beast,' plainly foretells a development of the spirit of intolerance
and persecution that was manifested by the nations represented by the dragon
and the leopardlike beast."—The Great Controversy, page 442.
   11. What papal institution will be enforced by law? Rev. 13:16.

    NOTE.—"As the sign of the authority of the Catholic Church, papist writ-
ers cite, 'the very act of changing the Sabbath into Sunday, which Protestants
allow of; . . . because by keeping Sunday, they acknowledge the church's
power to ordain feasts, and to command them under sin' What then is the
change of the Sabbath, but the sign, or mark, of the authority of the Roman
Church? ...
    "In the very act of enforcing a religious duty by secular power, the
churches would themselves form an image to the beast ; hence the enforce-
ment of Sundaykeeping in the United States would be an enforcement of the
worship of the beast and his image."—The Great Controversy, pages 448, 449.
   12. What miracle-working power will combine with Protestant
and Catholic forces in the enforcement of Sunday observance? Rev.
13:13, 14; 16:14.

    NorE.—"When Protestantism shall stretch her hand across the gulf to
grasp the hand of the Roman power, when she shall reach over the abyss to
clasp hands with spiritualism, when, under the influence of this threefold
union, our country shall repudiate every principle of its Constitution as a
Protestant and republican government, and shall make provision for the prop-
agation of papal falsehoods and delusions, then we may know that the time
has come for the marvelous working of Satan and that the end is near.
   "As the approach of the Roman armies was a sign to the disciples of the
impending destruction of Jerusalem, so may this apostasy be a sign to us that
the limit of God's forbearance is reached, that the measure of our nation's
iniquity is full, and that the angel of mercy is about to take her flight, never
to return."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 451.
  13. What penalties will be decreed against those who refuse to
worship the image of the beast or to receive his mark? What sol-
emn warning does the third angel's message utter against those who
worship the beast or receive his mark? Rev. 13:15, 17; 14:9-11.

    NOTE.—"The time is not far distant when the test will come to every soul.
The mark of the beast will be urged upon us. Those who have step by step
yielded to worldly demands and conformed to worldly customs will not find
it a hard matter to yield to the powers that be, rather than subject themselves
to derision, insult, threatened imprisonment, and death.... Many a star that
we have admired for its brilliancy will then go out in darkness. Chaff like
a cloud will be borne away on the wind, even from places where we see only
floors of rich wheat."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 81.
  14. What assurance of deliverance is given the loyal people of
God? Rev. 15:2, 3.

                             The Seal of God
   1. Before the winds of strife sweep the whole earth with destruc-
tion, what preparatory work must take place? Rev. 7:1-3.

   NorE.—"The sign, or seal, of God is revealed in the observance of the
seventh-day Sabbath, the Lord's memorial of creation. 'The Lord spake unto
Moses, saying, Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily My
Sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between Me and you throughout your
generations; that ye may know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify you.'
Ex. 31:12, 13. Here the Sabbath is clearly designated as a sign between God
and His people.
   "The mark of the beast is the opposite of this—the observance of the first
day of the week. This mark distinguishes those who acknowledge the suprem-
acy of the papal authority from those who acknowledge the authority of God."
—Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 117.
   2. How many are sealed? Who are the true Israel? Rev. 7:4;
Rom. 2:28, 29; Gal. 3:28, 29.

   3. With what is the seal connected? What three things must
the seal of a law contain? Isa. 8:16; 1 Kings 21:8; Esther 3:12; 8:8.

    NoTE.—"That is, affix the signature of royalty, that it may have the proper
authority. Anciently kings used a seal ring, containing the name, initials, or
monogram, for this purpose. Jezebel, the wife of Ahab, 'wrote letters in
Ahab's name, and sealed them with his seal.' 1 Kings 21:8. Of a Persian decree
it is said that 'in the name of King Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed with
the king's, ring.' Esther 3:12."—Bible Readings for the Home, 1949 ed., p. 441.
     4. What distinguishes the true God from all false gods? What
is the memorial of His creative works? Jer. 10:10-12; Ex. 20:8-11.

   NoTE.—"God's claim to reverence and worship, above the gods of the
heathen, is based upon the fact that He is the Creator, and that to Him all
other beings owe their existence."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 336.
                                      [ 22 3
  5. What three characteristics of a seal are found in the fourth
commandment?

    ANSWER: "In six days, (1) the Lord (name) ; (2) made (office, Creator) ;
(3) heaven and earth (dominion). This commandment alone, therefore, con-
tains 'the seal of the living God' This commandment shows God's authority
to enact all the commandments, and shows all other gods to be false gods.
The Sabbath commandment, therefore, contains the seal of God; and the
Sabbath itself, which is enjoined by the commandment, is inseparably con-
nected with this seal; it is to be kept in memory of God's creation of all
things; and it is itself called a 'sign' of the knowledge of this great truth.
(Exodus 31:17; Ezekiel 20:20.)"—Bible Readings for the Home, 1949 ed., pp.
441, 442.
    "The Sabbath of the fourth commandment is the seal of the living God."
 —The Great Controversy, page 640.
  6. What other expressions are used as synonymous with "seal"?
Rom. 4:11; Ezek. 9:4.

                      The Sign of Sanctification
   7. Of what is the Sabbath a sign? Can an unsanctified man keep
the Sabbath holy? Ex. 31:13, 17; Ezek. 20:12, 20.

    NOTE.—"The Sabbath is the sign of God's creative power, whether mani-
fested in creation or redemption; for redemption is creation—re-creation. It
requires the same power to redeem that it does to create. 'Create in me a clean
heart.' Psalm 51:10. 'We are . . . created in Christ Jesus unto good works.'
Ephesians 2:10. God designs that each Sabbath shall call Him to mind as
the One who created us, and whose grace and sanctifying power are working
in us to fit us for His eternal kingdom."—Bible Readings for the Home, 1949
ed., p. 442.
   8. Under the new covenant how and where are the principles
of the law written? Heb. 8:10; 2 Cor. 3:3.

   NorE.—"The same law that was engraved upon the tables of stone, is
written by the Holy Spirit upon the tables of the heart. Instead of going
about to establish our own righteousness, we accept the righteousness of
Christ. His blood atones for our sins. His obedience is accepted for us.
Then the heart renewed by the Holy Spirit will bring forth 'the fruits of the
Spirit.' Through the grace of Christ we shall live in obedience to the law
of God written upon our hearts. Having the Spirit of Christ, we shall walk
even as He walked."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 372.
   9. What does it mean to have the name of the Father in the
forehead? Rev. 14:1, 5; Ex. 34:5-7.

   NOTE.—"The name of the Father is expressive of His character. When
 Moses asked to see the glory of God, the Lord passed by and proclaimed His
                                    [ 23 ]
name—Me Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and
abundant in goodness and truth.' (Exodus 33:18, 19; 34:6.) God's law is
the transcript of that character, and the -name averred to in Revelation 14:1
is equivalent to the law of God. This is in harmony with the work of the
new covenant, under which the law. is written in the mind. (Hebrews 8:10.)
Since the law is written in the mind, the seal of the law is there also."—Bible
Readings for the Home, 1949 ed., p. 442.
    "The seal of God will never be placed upon the forehead of an impure
man or woman. It will never be placed upon the forehead of the ambitious,
world-loving man or woman. It will never be placed upon the forehead of
men or women of false tongues or deceitful hearts. All who receive the seal
must be without spot before God—candidates for heaven."—Testimonies, vol.
5, p. 216.
   10. How do the prophecies foretell the restoration of the Sab-
bath after many generations? Isa. 58:12-14; Rev. 14:9-12.

                       God's Seal of Protection
   11. By what sign were the homes of Israel protected when the
destroying angel passed through Egypt? Ex. 12:7, 13.

   NOTE.—"Had the Israelites disregarded in any particular the directions
given them, had they neglected to separate their children from the Egyptians,
had they slain the lamb, but failed to strike the doorpost with blood, or had
any gone out of their houses, they would not have been secure."—Patriarchs
and Prophets, page 278.
   12. As the judgments of God fall upon the world, what will be
the fate of professed believers who do not receive the seal of God?
Ezek. 9:4-6.

   13. To those who receive the seal, what protection            is assured?
Ps. 91:4-10.

    NoTE.—"What are you doing, brethren, in the great work of preparation?
Those who are uniting with the world are receiving the worldly mold, and
preparing for the mark of the beast. Those who are distrustful of self, who
are humbling themselves before God and purifying their souls by obeying
the truth—these are receiving the heavenly mold and preparing for the seal
of God in their foreheads. When the decree goes forth and the stamp is im-
pressed, their character will remain pure and spotless for eternity."—Testi-
monies, vol. 5, p. 216.
   14. What glorious privileges will be theirs? Rev. 7:14-17; 14:2-4.

   NoTE.—"None but the hundred and forty-four thousand can learn that
song; for it is the - song of their experience,—an experience such as no other
company have ever had. 'These are they which follow the Lamb whitherso-
ever He goethl' "—The Great Controversy, page 649.

               The Call for a Revival and Reformation
   1. How is the Laodicean church described by the faithful and
true witness? Rev. 3:14-17.

    NOTE.—"What is our condition in this fearful and solemn time? Alas,
what pride is prevailing in the church, what hypocrisy, what deception, what
love of dress, frivolity, and amusement, what desire for supremacy ! All these
sins haAie clouded the mind, so that eternal things have not been discerned."
—Review and Herald, March 22, 1887.
   2. Like the Ethiopian eunuch, what is the attitude of many all
over the world today? Acts 8:27-31.

    NOTE.—"There are many who are reading the Scriptures who cannot un-
derstand their true import. All over the world men and women are looking
wistfully to heaven. Prayers and tears and inquiries go up from souls longing
for light, for grace, for the Holy Spirit. Many are on the verge of the king-
dom, waiting only to be gathered in.
    "An angel guided Philip to the one who was seeking for light, and who
was ready to receive the gospel; and today angels will guide the footsteps of
those workers who will allow the Holy Spirit to sanctify their tongues and
refine and ennoble their hearts."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 109.
   3. What is our greatest need? Zeph. 2:1-3; Joel 2:12-17.

   NOTE.—"A revival of true godliness among us is the greatest and most
urgent of all our needs. To seek this should be our first work."—Review and
Herald, March 22, 1887.
   4. How only can the work be finished? Zech. 4:6; Acts 1:8.

    NoTE.—"The greatest victories to the church of Christ or to the individual
Christian, are not those that are gained by talent or education, by wealth, or
the favor of men. They are those victories that are gained in the audience
chamber with God, when earnest, agonizing faith lays hold upon the mighty
arm of power."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 203.
    "From the secret place of prayer came the power that shook the world
in the Great Reformation."—The Great Controversy, page 210.
                                       26 1
  5. Upon what condition will the Spirit be bestowed? Zech. 10:1;
Acts 2:1-4; 3:19, R.V.

    NoTE.—The Revised Version of Acts 3:19 reads: "Repent -ye therefore,
and turn again, that your sins may be blotted out, that so there may come
seasons of refreshing from the presence of the Lord."
    "I saw that none could share the 'refreshing,' unless they obtain the vic-
tory over every besetment, over pride, selfishness, love of the world, and over
every wrong word and action."—Early Writings, page 71.
    "When this reformation begins, the spirit of prayer will actuate every be-
liever and will banish from the church the spirit of discord and strife. Those
who have not been living in Christian fellowship will draw close to one an-
other."—Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 251.
                         The Loud Cry
   6. As the people of God unite in a reformatory movement, what
marked manifestation of divine power will be witnessed in the
finishing of the work? Joel 2:28, 29, 32; Rev. 18:1.

    NoTE.—"In visions of the night, representations passed before me of a
great reformatory movement among God's people. Many were praising God.
The sick were healed, and other miracles were wrought. A spirit of intercession
was seen, even as was manifested before the great Day of Pentecost. Hun-
dreds and thousands were seen visiting families and opening before them the
Word of God. Hearts were convicted by the power of the Holy Spirit, and
a spirit of genuine conversion was manifested. On every side doors were
thrown open to the proclamation of the truth. The world seemed to be
lightened with the heavenly influences."--Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 126.
  7. In the time of the early rain how did the layman participate?
Acts 8:1, 4.

    NoTE.—"The work of God in this earth can never be finished until the
men and women comprising our church membership rally to the work and
unite their efforts with those of ministers and church officers."—Testimonies,
vol. 9, p. 117.
   8. In times of crisis what type of men does God use? 1 Cor. 1:26-
29; 1 Kings 19:19; Matt. 4:18-20.

    NoTE.—"As the time comes for it [the third angel's message] to be given
with greatest power, the Lord will work through humble instruments, leading
the minds of those who consecrate themselves to His service. The laborers
will be qualified rather by the unction of His Spirit than by the training of
literary institutions. Men of faith and prayer will be constrained to go forth
with holy zeal, declaring the words which God gives them."—The Great Con-
troversy, page 606.
  9. Into what three religious groups is modern Babylon divided?
Rev. 16:13, 19.
                                     [26]
   Nom—The dragon represents the pagan world, the beast symbolizes the
papacy, the false prophet signifies apostate Protestantism.
   10. Under the loud cry of the angel of Revelation 18 how is the
condition of the popular churches described? What urgent call is
given, and why? Rev. 18:2-5.

    NoTE.—"The sins of Babylon will be laid open. The fearful results of
enforcing the observances of the church by civil authority, the inroads of
spiritualism, the stealthy but rapid progress of the papal power,—all will be
unmasked. By these solemn warnings the people will be stirred. Thousands
upon thousands will listen who have never heard words like these."—The
Great Controversy, page 606.
   11. What course of the religious leaders in Christ's day will be
repeated? Luke 11:52.

   NOTE.—"Since many refuse to be satisfied with the mere authority of
men, and demand a plain 'Thus saith the Lord,' the popular ministry, like
the Pharisees of old, filled with anger as their authority is questioned, will
denounce the message as of Satan, and stir up the sin-loving multitudes to
revile and persecute those who proclaim it."—The Great Controversy, page
607.
   12. As the fullness of divine power rests upon the people of God,
how will Satan's power be manifested? 2 Thess. 2:9, 10; Rev. 13:
13, 14.

    NoTE.—"Fearful sights of a supernatural character will 'soon be revealed in
the heavens, in token of the power of miracle-working demons. The spirits
of devils will go forth to the kings of the earth and to the whole world, to
fasten them in deception, and urge them on to unite with Satan in his last
struggle against the government of heaven. By these agencies, rulers and
subjects will be alike deceived. Persons will arise pretending to be Christ
Himself, and claiming the title and worship which belong to the world's
Redeemer. They will perform wonderful miracles of healing, and will pro-
fess to have revelations from heaven contradicting the testimony of the
Scriptures.
    "As the crowning act in the great drama of deception, Satan himself will
personate Christ."—The Great Controversy, page 624.
   13. As the final warning is given with compelling power, what
results will be seen? Luke 14:23; Rom. 9:28; Isa. 60:1-3.

    Nora.—"Now the rays of light penetrate everywhere, the truth is seen in
its clearness, and the honest children of God sever the bands which have held
them. Family connections, church relations, are powerless to stay them now.
Truth is more precious than all besides. Notwithstanding the agencies -com-
bined against the truth, a large number take their stand upon the Lord's side."

  1. By what fateful decree is the close of the investigative judg-
ment announced? Rev. 22:11, 12.

  2. What will be the condition of those who have neglected the
needful preparation? Matt. 25:8-13; Jer. 8:20.

    NorE.—"Oh, how many I saw in the time of trouble without a shelter I
They had neglected the needful preparation, therefore they could not receive
the refreshing that all must have to fit them to live in the sight of a holy
God. Those who refuse to be hewed by the prophets, and fail to purify their
souls in obeying the whole truth, and who are willing to believe that their
condition is far better than it really is, will come up to the time of the falling
of the plagues, and then see that they needed to be hewed and squared for
the building. But there will be no time then to do it and no Mediator to
plead their cause before the Father."—Early Writings, page 71.
   3. When Jesus ceases His intercession in heaven, what follows
on earth? Dan. 12:1.

   NOTE. "The wicked have passed the boundary of their probation; the
Spirit of God, persistently resisted, has been at last withdrawn. Unsheltered
by divine grace, they have no protection from the wicked one. Satan will
then plunge the inhabitants of the earth into one great, final trouble. As the
angels of God cease to hold in check the fierce winds of human passion, all
the elements of strife will be let loose. The whole world will be involved in
ruin."—The Great Controversy, page 614.
                     The Experience of God's People
  4. How will the hatred toward the people of God be manifested?
Rev. 13:15, 17.

   NoTE.—"Conscientious obedience to the word of God will be treated as
rebellion. Blinded by Satan, the parent will exercise harshness and severity
                                    [ 28]
toward the believing child; the master or mistress will oppress the command-
ment-keeping servant. Affection will be alienated; children will be disin-
herited, and driven from home. The words of Paul will be literally fulfilled,
`All that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.' As the
defenders of truth refuse to honor the Sunday-sabbath, some of them will
be thrust into prison, some will be exiled, some will be treated as slaves."—
The Great Controyersy, page 608.
  5. How will many commandment keepers seek to escape the
wrath of their enemies? Luke 17:28-32; Isa. 33:16, first part.

    NOTE.—"As the decree issued by the various rulers of Christendom against
commandment keepers shall withdraw the protection of government, and
abandon them to those who desire their destruction, the people of God will
flee from the cities and villages and associate together in companies, dwelling
in the most desolate and solitary places. Many will find refuge in the strong-
holds of the mountains. . . . But many of all nations, and of all classes, high
and low, rich and poor, black and white, will be cast into the most unjust
and cruel bondage."—The Great Controversy, page 626.
   6. As the death decree is pronounced upon the people of God,
into what experience will they be plunged? Jer. 30:5-7.

   NOTE.—"Jacob's night of anguish, when he wrestled in prayer for deliver-
ance from the hand of Esau, represents the experience of God's people in the
time of trouble." "Had not Jacob previously repented of his sin in obtaining
the birthright by fraud, God would not have heard his prayer and mercifully
preserved his life. So, in the time of trouble, if the people of God had uncon-
fessed sins to appear before them while tortured with fear and anguish, they
would be overwhelmed; despair would cut off their faith, and they could not
have confidence to plead with God for deliverance."—The Great Controversy,
pages 616, 620.
                               The Plagues
   7. When Pharaoh lifted his hand against God and against His
chosen people, how was Egypt brought low? Ps. 105:28-36.

   NoTE.—"When Christ ceases His intercession in the sanctuary, the un-
mingled wrath threatened against those who worship the beast and his image
and receive his mark, will be poured out. The plagues upon Egypt when God
was about to deliver Israel, were similar in character to those more terrible
and extensive judgments which are to fall upon the world just before the final
deliverance of God's people."—The Great Controversy, pages 627, 628.
  8. As the powers of earth set themselves to destroy the people
and truth of God, how will God's judgments be manifested? Rev.
15:1; 18:8.

   NOTE.—"It is impossible to give any idea of the experience of the people
of God who shall be alive upon the earth when celestial glory and a repetition
                                    [ 29 ]
of the persecutions of the past are blended. They will walk in the light pro-
ceeding from the throne of God."—Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 16.
  9. What is the first plague, and upon whom will it fall? Rev.
16:2; Zech. 14:12.

  10. How will the very elements be used in the next four plagues?
Rev. 16:3-11; Joel 1:15-20.

   NOTE.—"These plagues are not universal, or the inhabitants of the earth
would be wholly cut off. Yet they will be the most awful scourges that have
ever been known to mortals. All the judgments upon men, prior to the close
of probation, have been mingled with mercy."—The Great Controversy,
pages 628, 629.
   11. What other famine will come upon those who have rejected
the last message of mercy and warning? Amos 8:11, 12.

   NOTE.—"Others rushed to the people of God and begged to be taught
how they might escape His judgments. But the saints had nothing for them.
The last tear for sinners had been shed, the last agonizing prayer offered, the
last burden borne, the last warning given. The sweet voice of mercy was
no more to invite them. When the saints, and all heaven, were interested
for their salvation, they had no interest for themselves."—Early Writings,
page 281.
   12. Under the sixth plague, through the influence of the spirits
of devils how universal will be the final war? Rev. 16:12-16; Joel
3:9-14; Jer. 25:32, 33.

   NOTE.—"Without having improved appreciably in virtue or enjoying
wiser guidance, [mankind] has got into its hands for the first time the tools
by which it can unfailingly accomplish its own extermination. That is the
point in human destinies to which all the glories and toils of men have at
last led them. They would do well to pause and ponder upon their new
responsibilities. Death stands at attention, obedient, expectant, ready to serve,
ready to shear away the peoples en masse; ready, if called on, to pulverize,
without hope of repair, what is left of civilization."—Winston Churchill,
Amid These Storms, page 248.
   13. What assurance of divine protection and deliverance is given
the loyal remnant? Isa. 33:16, last part; Hab. 3:17, 18; Ps. 91:3-10.

    NoTE.—"The people of God will not be free from suffering; but while
persecuted and distressed, while they endure privation, and suffer for want
of food, they will not be left to perish. That God who cared for Elijah, will
not pass by one of His self-sacrificing children. He who numbers the hairs
of their head, will care for them; and in time of famine they shall be satisfied.
While the wicked are dying from hunger and pestilence, angels will shield the
righteous, and supply their wants."—The Great Controversy, page 629.

deliverance was wrought? Esther 9:1, 6.

protect His people while they 'stood for their lives.'"—Prophets and Kings,
page 602.

   3. How does the psalmist reveal God's final intervention on be-
half of His people? Ps. 50:1-5.

   NoTE.—"It was at midnight that God chose to deliver His people. As the
wicked were mocking around them, suddenly the sun appeared, shining in
his strength, and the moon stood still. The wicked looked upon the scene
with amazement, while the saints beheld with solemn joy the tokens of their
deliverance. Signs and wonders followed in quick succession. Everything
seemed turned out of its natural course. The streams ceased to flow."—Early
Writings, page 285.
                            Under the Seventh Plague
  4. As under the seventh plague the voice of God is heard, what
mighty upheaval follows? Rev. 16:17-21; Joel 3:16.

   NoTE.—"That voice shakes the. heavens and the earth. There is a mighty
earthquake, 'such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an
earthquake, and so great.' The firmament appears to open and shut. The
glory from the throne of God seems flashing through. . . . The whole earth
                                   [ 31 ]
heaves and swells like the waves of the sea. Its surface is breaking up. Its
very foundations seem to be giving way. Mountain chains are sinking.
Inhabited islands disappear. . . . The proudest cities of the earth are laid
low."—The Great Controversy, page 637.
  5. Who will come up in a special resurrection to witness the
coming of the Lord? Dan. 12:2; Matt. 26:64; Rev. 1:7.

    NoTE.—"All who have died in the faith of the third angel's message come
forth from the tomb glorified, to hear God's covenant of peace with those
who have kept His law. 'They also which pierced Him,' those that mocked
and derided Christ's dying agonies, and the most violent opposers of His
truth and His people, are raised to behold Him in His glory, and to see the
honor placed upon the loyal and obedient."—The Great Controversy, page 637.
   6. At this time what triumphant song will express the holy
trust of those who have held fast their faith in the very face of
death? Ps. 46:1-3; Isa. 30:29, 30.

                        His Glorious Appearing
   7. In what striking manner will Jehovah vindicate His right-
eousness? Ps. 50:6. Compare also Ps. 119:172.

     NOTE.—"Then there appears against the sky a hand holding two tables
of stone folded together. Says the prophet, 'The heavens shall declare His
righteousness: for God is Judge Himself.' That holy law, God's righteousness,
that amid thunder and flame was proclaimed from Sinai as the guide of life,
is now revealed to men as the rule of judgment. The hand opens the tables,
and there are seen the precepts of the Decalogue, traced as with a pen of
 fire."—The Great Controversy, page 639.
   8. How does the prophet Habakkuk describe the glorious com-
ing of the Lord? Hab. 3:3-6, 11.

   9. As they see the King in His glory, what will the wicked do?
Isa. 2:10-12, 19-21, margin; Rev. 6:14-17.

    NOTE.—"The derisive jests have ceased. Lying lips are hushed into silence.
The clash of arms, the tumult of battle, 'with confused noise, and garments
rolled in blood,' is stilled. Nought now is heard but the voice of prayer and
the sound of weeping and lamentation. The cry bursts forth from lips so
lately scoffing, 'The great day of His wrath is come; and who shall be able
to stand?' The wicked pray to be buried beneath the rocks of the mountains,
rather than meet the face of Him whom they have despised and rejected."—
The Great Controversy, page 642.
                    The Resurrection of the Just
  10. What glorious event now takes place? 1 Thess. 4:16, 17;
Matt. 24:30, 31.
                            (32 ]
    NOTE.—"The living righteous are changed 'in a moment, in the twinkling
of an eye.' At the voice of God they were glorified ; now they are made
immortal, and with the risen saints are caught up to meet their Lord in the
air. Angels 'gather together the elect from the four winds, from one end of
heaven to the other.' Little children are borne by holy angels to their mothers'
arms. Friends long separated by death are united, nevermore to part, and
with songs of gladness ascend together to the City of God."—The Great Con-
troversy, page 645.
   11. What change takes place in the righteous at this time? Phil.
3:20, 21; 1 Cor. 15:51-53; Isa. 35:4-6.

    NOTE.—"All come forth from their graves the same in stature as when
they entered the tomb. . . . But all arise with the freshness and vigor of
eternal youth. In the beginning, man was created in the likeness of God, not
only in character, but in form and feature. Sin defaced and almost obliterated
the divine image; but Christ came to restore that which had been lost. He
will change our vile bodies, and fashion them like unto His glorious body.
The mortal, corruptible form, devoid of comeliness, once polluted with sin,
becomes perfect, beautiful, and immortal. All blemishes and deformities are
left in the grave."—The Great Controversy, pages 644, 645.

    12. At His coming what precious promise does our Lord ful-
fill? John 14:1-3.
                               Palms of Victory
   13. How did Isaiah foretell the entrance of the redeemed into
the New Jerusalem? Isa. 26:1, 2.

   14. As the unnumbered multitude of the saved stand before the
throne of God, to whom do they ascribe praise? Rev. 7:9, 10.

   NoTE.—"Upon the heads of the overcomers, Jesus with His own right
hand places the crown of glory. For each there is a crown, bearing his own
`new name,' and the inscription, 'Holiness to the Lord.' In every hand are
placed the victor's palm and the shining harp. Then, as the commanding
angels strike the note, every hand sweeps the harp strings with skillful touch,
awaking sweet music in rich, melodious strains. Rapture unutterable thrills
every heart, and each voice is raised in grateful praise."—The Great Contro-
versy, page 646.

                      Lesson 12, for March 24, 1951

                        The Binding of Satan
   MEMORY VERSE: "Judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who
both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the
counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God." 1 Corinthians 4:5.

   2. How complete will be the desolation of the earth? Isa. 24:1-3;
Jer. 4:23-27.

    NOTE.—"The earth looked like a desolate wilderness. Cities and villages,
shaken down by the earthquake, lay in heaps. Mountains had been moved
out of their places, leaving large caverns. Ragged rocks, thrown out by the
sea, or torn out of the earth itself, were scattered all over its surface. Large
trees had been uprooted, and were strewn over the land."—Early Writings,
page 290.
   3. Why are these judgments visited upon the world? Isa. 24:5,
6; Rev. 18:5-8.

   4. What is the bottomless pit of Revelation 20:1?

    ANSWER: "The use which specially throws light upon the meaning of the
word here is found in Genesis 1:2, where we read that 'darkness was upon
the face of the deep.' The word there rendered 'deep' is the same word that
is here rendered 'bottomless pit.' . . . [It] is applied to the earth in its chaotic
state. Precisely this it must mean in this third verse of Revelation 20. Let
it be borne in mind that at the time the angel does this work, the earth is
a vast charnel house of desolation and death."—Daniel and the Revelation,
pages 742, 743.
   5. For how long will this earth in its desolate condition be the
prison house of Satan and his angels? Rev. 20:1-3.

    NorE.—"Here is to be the home of Satan with his evil angels for a thousand
years. Limited to the earth, he will not have access to other worlds, to tempt
and annoy those who have never fallen. It is in this sense that he is bound:
there are none remaining, upon whom he can exercise his power. He is wholly
cut off from the work of deception and ruin which for so many centuries has
been his sole delight."—The Great Controversy, page 659.
   6. In what work will the saints engage during the thousand
years in heaven? Rev. 20:4; 1 Cor. 6:2, 3; 4:5.
                                       E34 ]
    NoTE.—"It is at this time that, as foretold by Paul, 'the saints shall judge
the world.' In union with Christ they judge the wicked, comparing their
acts with the statute book, the Bible, and deciding every case according to
the deeds done in the body. Then the portion which the wicked must suffer
is meted out, according to their works; and it is recorded against their names
in the book of death. Satan also and evil angels are judged by Christ and
His people."—The Great Controversy, page 661.          '
                               Satan Loosed
   7. At the end of the thousand years who returns to earth with
Christ? What sacred spot will our Lord prepare for the New
Jerusalem? Zech. 14:4, 5, 9; Rev. 21:2.

   8. By what means is Satan loosed? Isa. 24:22; Acts 24:15; Rev.
20:5.

    NOTE.-"At the close of the thousand years, Christ again returns to the
earth. He is accompanied by the host of the redeemed, and attended by a
retinue of angels. As He descends in terrific majesty, He bids the wicked
dead arise to receive their doom. They come forth, a mighty host, number-
less as the sands of the sea."—The Great Controversy, page 662.
   9. What, final attempt does Satan make to overthrow the throne
of God? Rev. 20:7-9.

   Nora.—"At last the order to advance is given, and the countless host
moves on,—an army such as was never summoned by earthly conquerors,
such as the combined forces of all ages since war began on earth could never
equal. Satan, the mightiest of warriors, leads the van, and his angels unite
their forces for this final struggle. . . . With military precision, the serried
ranks advance over the earth's broken and uneven surface."—The Great Con-
troversy, page 664.
                       The Final Judgment Scene
  10. As the numberless host of the wicked surround the city of
God, what revelation of glory appears? Rev. 20:11, 12.

   NOTE.—"As soon as the books of record are opened, and the eye of Jesus
looks upon the wicked, they are conscious of every sin which they have ever
committed. They see just where their feet diverged from the path of purity
and holiness, just how far pride and rebellion have carried them in the viola-
tion of the law of God. The seductive temptations which they encouraged
by indulgence in sin, the blessings perverted, the messengers of God despised,
the warnings rejected, the waves of mercy beaten back by the stubborn,
unrepentant heart,—all appear as if written in letters of fire."—The Great
Controversy, page 666.
   11. What prophetic words of Jesus are then fulfilled? Matt. 25:
31-46.
                             [35]
   NoTE.—"Let none suppose that they can live a life of selfishness, and then,
having served their own interests, enter into the joy of their Lord. In the
joy of unselfish love they could not participate. They would not be fitted
for the heavenly courts. They could not appreciate the pure atmosphere of
love that pervades heaven."—Christ's Object Lessons, pages 364, 365.
   12. As every secret thing comes to light in the judgment, what
universal confession will be made? Rom. 14:11, 12.

   NOTE.—"Satan bows down, and confesses the justice of his sentence. . . .
With all the facts of the great controversy in view, the whole universe, both
loyal and rebellious, with one accord declare, 'Just and true are Thy ways,
Thou King of saints.' "—The Great Controversy, pages 670, 671.
  13. What follows the pronouncing of the sentence of doom?
Rev. 20:9 (last part), 14, 15; 2 Peter 3:10-12; Mal. 4:1.

    NOTE.—"Fire comes down from God out of heaven. The earth is broken
up. The weapons concealed in its depths are drawn forth. Devouring flames
burst from every yawning chasm. The very rocks are on fire. The day has
come that shall burn as an oven. The elements melt with fervent heat, the
earth also, and the works that are therein are burned up. The earth's surface
seems one molten mass,—a vast, seething lake of fire. It is the time of the
judgment and perdition of ungodly men,—`the day of the Lord's vengeance,
and the year of recompenses for the controversy of Zion.'"—The Great Con-
troversy, pages 672, 673.
   14. While mercy still lingers, what divine appeal should we
heed? Isa. 55:6, 7; Ezek. 18:30-32.


                     Lesson 13, for March 31, 1951

                     The Controversy Ended

                      Two Fundamental Principles
   1. In the life of Satan what fundamental principle was mani-
fested? Isa. 14:13, 14; 1 Tim. 3:6.
                                        36 I
    NOTE.—"Little by little, Lucifer came to indulge the desire for self-exalta-
tion. . . . Not content with his position, though honored above the heavenly
host, he ventured to covet homage due alone to the Creator. Instead of seeking
to make God supreme in the affections and allegiance of all created beings,
it was his endeavor to secure their service and loyalty to himself. And covet-
ing the glory with which the infinite Father had invested His Son, this prince
of angels aspired to power that was the prerogative of Christ alone;"—Patri-
archs and Prophets, page 35.
   2. What is the outworking of the principle of pride and self-
seeking? Ezek. 28:17-19; Mal. 4:1.

    NOTE.—"Satan's work of ruin is forever ended. For six thousand years he
has wrought his will, filling the earth with woe, and causing grief throughout
the universe. The whole creation has groaned and travailed together in pain.
Now God's creatures are forever delivered from his presence and temptations."
—The Great Controversy, page 673.
   3. In the life of Jesus what great principle was demonstrated?
Phil. 2:5-8; Matt. 20:28.

     NOTE.—"We marvel at the Saviour's sacrifice in exchanging the throne of
heaven for the manger, and the companionship of adoring angels for the
beasts of the stall. Human pride and self-sufficiency stand rebuked in His
presence. Yet this was but the beginning of His wonderful condescension.
. . . Jesus accepted humanity when the race had been weakened by four
thousand years of sin. . . . He [God] permitted Him to meet life's peril in
common with every human soul, to fight the battle as every child of humanity
must fight it, at the risk of failure and eternal loss."—The Desire of Ages,
pages 48, 49.
   4. What was the outworking of the principle of love and un-
selfish service? Phil. 2:9-11; Matt. 23:12.

    NoTE.—"The plan of redemption will not be fully understood, even when
the ransomed see as they are seen and know as they are known; but through

delighted mind. . . . The cross of Christ will be the science and song of the
redeemed through all eternity."—The Great Controversy, page 651.
                        God's Promises Fulfilled
  5. After the purifying fire destroys sin and sinners, what will
come forth from the hand of the Creator? Rev. 21:1; 2 Peter 3:13.

    6. What promise is then fulfilled? Gen. 13:14-16; Heb. 11:9, 10.

   7. Who are the true Israel of the promise? Rom. 2:28, 29; Gal.
3:16, 29.
   8. What promise made to David now comes to pass? 2 Sam.
7:12, 13, 16; Luke 1:31-33; Isa. 9:6, 7.

                            The Restitution
   9. How is the original purpose in the creation of the earth then
realized? Matt. 5:5; Micah 4:8; Ps. 37:10,11.

   NOTE.—"The time has come, to which holy men have looked with longing
since the flaming sword barred the first pair from Eden, the time for 'the
redemption of the purchased possession.' The earth originally given to man
as his kingdom, betrayed by him into the hands of Satan, and so long held
by the mighty foe, has been brought back by the great plan of redemption."
—The Great Controversy, page 674.
   10. How complete will be the restoration? Luke 19:10; Acts
3:21; Isa. 11:9.

   11. What assurance is given that we shall know each other there?
1 Cor. 13:12.

    NoTE.—"There the redeemed shall 'know, even as also they are known.'
The loves and sympathies which God Himself has planted in the soul, shall
there find truest and sweetest exercise. The pure communion with holy beings,
the harmonious social life with the blessed angels and with the faithful ones
of all ages, who have washed their robes and made them white in the blood
of the Lamb, the sacred ties that bind together 'the whole family in heaven
and earth,'—these help to constitute the happiness of the redeemed."—The
Great Controversy, page 677.

                         From Glory to Glory
   12. What is said of the activity of the inhabitants of the new
earth? Isa. 65:21, 22.

   13. As the rolling years of eternity bring richer and more glori-
ous revelations, with what universal anthem of praise will the arches
of heaven ring? Rev. 5:13.

   NOTE.—"The great controversy is ended. Sin and sinners are no more.
The entire universe is clean. One pulse of harmony and gladness beats through
the vast creation. From Him who created all, flow life and light and gladness,
throughout the realms of illimitable space. From the minutest atom to the

      THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
           March 31, 1951—Southern African Division

    A wonderful privilege is accorded the Sabbath school members this quar-
ter in giving for the extension of our mission work in the Southern African
Division. A new school building at Cuale, in Angola, is greatly needed. No
more needy project than this could be selected. It is a field of wonderful
opportunity, but requires trained native workers. Another project is the
establishment of a new training school in the Kasai area of the Congo. Here
is a vast, unentered area where millions of people still sit in darkness. The
third project is a hospital building at Malamulo, Nyasaland. The Malamulo
Mission Hospital has proved itself an evangelizing center. Some of the old
buildings date from early days, and are entirely inadequate. There is great
need for better facilities.
    The influence of our schools and hospitals upon the lives and thinking
of those who come in contact with them is incalculable. In this day of
change in an Africa full of problems and difficulties, these institutions are
exerting a stabilizing influence upon the people, and are demonstrating that
there is a better way—a way of peace, of good will and Christian kindness.
    In 1949 an overflow offering of $36,117.73 was given for a hospital in
Basutoland. For this, grateful thanks come from South Africa.
    Can you not double your offering on March 31 for the furtherance of
the gospel and for the alleviation of suffering in South Africa, where the
offerings give such great results?
