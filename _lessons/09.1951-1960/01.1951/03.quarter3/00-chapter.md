STUDIES ON CREATION AND REDEMPTION

                                   PART I

                                Introduction
    The purpose of creation and the plan of redemption are comparable. Man
was created in the image of God; redemption is the restoration of that image.
"To restore in man the image of his Maker, to bring him back to the perfec-
tion in which he was created, to promote the development of body, mind,
and soul, that the divine purpose in his creation might be realized,—this was
to be the work of redemption. This is the object of education, the great
object of life." "Though marred by sin, it [nature) speaks not only of creation
but of redemption. . . . In every manifestation of creative power is held out
the assurance that we may be created anew in 'righteousness and holiness of
truth.' Eph. 4:24, margin. Thus the very objects and operations of nature
that bring so vividly to mind our great loss become to us the messengers of
hope."—Education, pages 15, 16, 27.
    The question often asked, "Which is true, science or the Bible?" reveals
a lack of appreciation of either one of these expositors of truth. "God is the
author of science.... Rightly understood, science and the written word agree,
and each sheds light on the other. Together they lead us to God, by teaching
us something of the wise and beneficent laws through which He works."—
Counsels to Teachers, page 426.
    The more one studies, the more apparent it is to him as it was to Job that
one cannot by searching find out God. However, every follower of Christ
has the privilege and duty of learning much which has been revealed con-
cerning God and His ways and works through the Inspired Word, through
His revelation in creation, and by an intimate walk with Christ. "Only under
the direction of the Omniscient One shall we, in the study of His works, be
enabled to think His thoughts after Him."—Education, page 134.


                       Lesson 1, for July 7, 1951

                The Eternal One; the Trinity
    MEMORY VERSE: "Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in
the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost." Matt. 28:19.
    STUDY HELPS: R. E. Hoen, "The Creator and His Workshop," chapter 1;
"Patriarchs and Prophets," pages 33, 34; "Testimonies," vol. 8, pp. 263-278.
     INTRODUCTION: The triune Godhead, self-existent and eternal, a unit in pur-
pose but distinct in personality and activity, comprises the great God and Father of
all, the only-begotten Son who "was in the beginning with God," and the Holy Spirit.
These constitute the Godhead in whom "we live, and move, and have our being,"
supremely worthy of our study, adoration, love, and obedience.
                                         [ 3]
                        DAILY STUDY ASSIGNMENT
   1. General survey of the lesson.     5. Questions 11-14. Read chapter 1,
   2. Questions 1-4. Read Introduction—      "The Creator and His Work-
        Part I.                              shop."
   3. Questions 5-7; memorize Matt.     6. Read "Patriarchs and Prophets"
        28:19.                               assignment. Review Matt. 28:19.
   4. Questions 8-10.                   7. Read "Testimonies" assignment.
                                             Review lesson.

                            The Eternal One
   1. What do the Scriptures teach concerning the eternity of God?
Ps. 90:2; Gen. 1:1.
  NOTE.—The Hebrew word here used to signify God is the plural, Elohim,
which indicates that the activity of the Godhead was a work of collaboration.
Compare Gen. 1:26: "God said, Let us make man...."

   2. How is the self-existence of God expressed? Ex. 3:14.

    NOTE.—"I AM" is a name, a part of whose meaning may be expressed
by "The Self-Existent One."
    "God announces Himself: 1. As personal. 2. As independent. 3. As self-
existent. 4. Immutable."—The Preacher's Homiletic Commentary, Exodus,
page 45.
    "The idea expressed by the name is . . . that of real, perfect uncondi-
tional, independent existence."—The Pulpit Commentary, vol. 1, p. 67.

   3. What unique position is occupied by God? Ps. 86: 10; Isa.
44:6.
  NOTE.—These references to Elohim evidently apply to the members of the
Godhead collectively.

                        The Father and the Son
   4. What is further said of God, the Father? 1 Tim. 1:17 (King
Eternal); Eph. 4:6; 3:14, 15 (Father).

  5. Who are the other members of the Godhead? Matt. 28:19;
Eph. 4:4-6.

   6. What position does Christ occupy in the Godhead? John
20:31.

   NoTE.—The divine Sonship of the Man Christ Jesus is attested by many
witnesses. Attention should be directed especially to the prophecy of the angel
to Mary (Luke 1:35), the voice from heaven at the baptism of Jesus (Matt.
3:17; Mark 1:11), the recognition of Sonship by Jesus Himself (Matt. 11:
25-27; John 17:1-5), the recognition by Nathanael (John 1:49), the testi-
                                     [4]
mony of Peter by revelation (Matt. 16:16, 17), the voice on the mount of
transfiguration (Matt. 17:5; Mark 9:7; 2 Peter 1:16-18), the acknowledg-
ment by the terror-stricken centurion at the cross (Mark 15:39) and by
demons (Luke 4:41), the convincing record of John (John 20:31), and the
unequivocal statements of Paul (Col. 1:3, 12, 13; Acts 9:20; Rom. 1:1-4).
These and many others agree that Jesus Christ our Saviour is "the only-
begotten Son of God" (John 3:16, 18).
   7. What likeness exists between the Father and the Son? Heb.
1:1-3; Col. 1:15.

   NoTE.—Christ "is the image of the invisible God" (Col. 1:15), and "the
very image of His substance" (Heb. 1:3, R.V.). He is more than a mere like-
ness of God; He is God. "Christ alone is 'the express image' of the Father;
but man was formed in the likeness of God."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
page 45.
   The Greek word translated "the express image" (A.V.) and "very image"
(R.V.) is charakter, "character." The word occurs in the inscription for
"person" as well as for the "exact reproduction" of a person.

   8. How closely have the Father and the Son always been united
in purpose and counsel? Matt. 11:27; John 10:30.

   Ncrrn.—"Christ, the Word, the Only Begotten of God, was one with the
eternal Father,—one in nature, in character, in purpose,—the only being that
could enter into all the counsels and purposes of God."—Patriarchs and
Prophets, page 34.
  9. What do the Scriptures teach concerning the existence of the
Son? Col. 1:17; John 1:1, 2; 17:5.

    NOTE.—"In speaking of His pre-existence, Christ carries the mind back
through dateless ages. He assures us that there never was a time when He
was not in close fellowship with the eternal God."—Ellen G. White, in Signs
of the Times, Aug. 29, 1900. "Christ was God essentially, and in the highest
sense. He was with God from all eternity, God over all, blessed for evermore.
The Lord Jesus Christ, the divine Son of God, existed from eternity, a dis-
tinct person, yet one with the Father."—Ellen G. White, in Review and
Herald, April 5, 1906.
   10. What are some of the significant titles borne by Him? Heb.
1:8; Isa. 9:6.

                       The Holy Spirit
   11. Who is the Third Member of the Trinity? How enduring
is He? Matt. 28:19; Heb. 9:14.

   NoTE.—Instead of "Holy Ghost," the American Revised Version of Mat-
thew 28:19 appropriately reads "Holy Spirit."
                                 [6 ]
   12. What titles are borne by the Holy Spirit? What are some
of His activities? 1 John 4:2; Luke 4:18; John 14:16, 26.

    NOTE.—"The greatness of God is to us incomprehensible. 'The Lord's
throne is in heaven;' yet by His Spirit He is everywhere present."—Educa-
tion, page 132. "By His Spirit He is everywhere present. Through the agency
of His Spirit and His angels, He ministers to the children of men."—The Min-
istry of Healing, page 417.
                          Unity of the Godhead
  13. How is the unity of purpose of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
expressed? John 10:38; 14:26; 15:26.

   14. How closely does the Trinity associate with mankind in
need? John 14:17, 20-23. Compare 1 Cor. 6:19; Col. 1:27; Acts
17:27.

   NOTE.—The Godhead is a divine Fatherhood after whom it is purposed
through redemption to name the whole united family of heaven and earth.
Small wonder that one with God is a majority!


                      Lesson 2, for July 14, 1951
            The Creator of All, the True God
    MEMORY VERSE: "Fear God, and give glory to Him; for the hour of His
judgment is come: and worship Him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and
the fountains of waters." Rev. 14:7.
   STUDY HELPS: R. E. Hoen, "The Creator and His Workshop," chapter 2;
"Testimonies," vol. 8, pp. 258-264; "Patriarchs and Prophets," pages 115, 116.
    INTRODUCTION: While an "unknown god" in the form of philosophies and
panaceas is being sought by a sin-sick world, the only true God still is He in whom
"we live, and move, and have our being." A significant part of the message for the
world today directs the worship of all mankind to the Creator. Rev. 14:7.

                        DAILY STUDY ASSIGNMENT
   1. General survey of the lesson.           "The Creator and His Work-

                               The True God
   1. How is the true God identified? Isa. 42:5; 45:18.

   NorE.—"The duty to worship God is based upon the fact that He is the
Creator, and that to Him all other beings owe their existence. And wherever,
                                     E6]
in the Bible, His claim to reverence and worship, above the gods of the
heathen, is presented, there is cited the evidence of His creative power. 'All the
gods of the nations are idols: but the Lord made the heavens.' Ps. 96:5. 'To
whom then will ye liken Me, or shall I be equal? saith the Holy One. Lift
up your eyes on high, and behold who bath created these things.' Isa. 40:
25, 26. 'Thus saith the Lord that created the heavens; God Himself that
formed the earth and made it; . . . I am Jehovah; and there is none else.'
[Isa. 45:18, A.V. and A.R.V.] . . . And the holy beings who worship God
in heaven state, as the reason why their homage is due to Him, 'Thou art
worthy, 0 Lord, to receive glory and honor and power: for Thou hast created
all things.' Rev. 4:11.
    "In Revelation 14, men are called upon to worship the Creator; and the
prophecy brings to view a class that, as the result of the threefold message,
are keeping the commandments of God. One of these commandments points
directly to God as the Creator."—The Great Controversy, pages 436, 437.
See Isa. 40:28; 43:1.
   2. In contrast to the power of the true God, what impotence
is displayed by idols? Ps. 115:4-8; Isa. 44:14-20; 46:3-7.

   3. How impotent is man himself compared with the Creator?
Job 38:1, 4, 12.

   4. To what extent is the Creator independent of man? Acts
17:24, 25; Ps. 50:12.

                       The Omnipresence of God
   5. Where is the dwelling place of God? To what extent is He
limited by space or time? Isa. 66:1; Ps. 90:1-4; 139:7-12.

   6. While dwelling in "the high and holy place," how consider-
ate is God of the lowly things of His universe? Isa. 57:15; Ps.
113:4-8.

                          The Infinite Architect
  7. What was one purpose in the creation of visible things?
Rom. 1:20; Job 12:7-9.

   NOTE.—"The whole natural world is designed to be an interpreter of the
things of God. To Adam and Eve in their Eden home, nature was full of
the knowledge of God, teeming with divine instruction. ... Even now, rightly
studied and interpreted, she speaks of her Creator. . . .
   "The most effective way to teach the heathen who know not God is through
His works. . . . There is a simplicity and purity in these lessons direct from
nature that make them of the highest value to others besides the heathen."
—Counsels to Teachers, page 186.
                                       [7]
   8. Show by the Scriptures that creation was planned and did
not come by chance. Prov. 3:19; Jer. 10:12; Ps. 104:24.

    NOTE.—"All created things, in their original perfection, were an expression
of the thought of God."—Education, pages 16, 17.

                           The Master Builder
  9. Who was the principal agent in the creation? Heb. 1:1, 2;
Eph. 3:9. See also John 1:1-3.

    NoTE.—"In the beginning, God was revealed in all the works of creation.
It was Christ that spread the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth.
It was His hand that hung the worlds in space, and fashioned the flowers of
the field. . . . And upon all things in earth, and air, and sky, He wrote the
message of the Father's love."—The Desire of Ages, page 20. See also The
Great Controversy, page 493 (new ed., p. 560).
   10. Who else was active in the creative work? Gen. 1:2.

    NOTE.—" 'When He, the Spirit of truth, is come, He will guide you into
all truth.' Only by the aid of that Spirit who in the beginning 'was brooding
upon the face of the waters;' of that Word by whom 'all things were made;'
of that 'true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world,'
can the testimony of science be rightly interpreted. Only by their guidance
can its deepest truths be discerned."—Education, page 134.

                   The Sustainer of the Universe
  11. What is the present relation of the Creator to .the universe?
Heb. 1:3; Col. 1:17; Neh. 9:6.

    NOTE.—The words "by Him all things consist" (Col. 1:17) are otherwise
rendered "hold together" (A.R.V., margin), "and He sustains and embraces
them all" (Goodspeed). "The hand that sustains the worlds in space, the
hand that holds in their orderly arrangement and tireless activity all things
throughout the universe of God, is the hand that was nailed to the cross for
us."—Education, page 132. See also The Acts of the Apostles, pages 471, 472.
  12. By what laws of nature does God exemplify His constancy?
How unfailing are His plans? Jer. 31:35-37.

  13. How responsive is nature to the commands of God for its
maintenance? Ps. 119:89-91; 33:9.

    Nora.—"Nature is the servant of her Creator. God does not annul His
laws, or work contrary to them; but He is continually using them as His
instruments. Nature testifies of an intelligence, a presence, an active energy,
that works in and through her laws."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 114.

                        Lesson 3, for July 21, 1951

     The Origin of the Universe: the Rebellion
                    of Lucifer
    MEMORY VERSE: "By the word of the Lord were the heavens made; and all
the host of them by the breath of His mouth.... For He spake, and it was done; He
commanded, and it stood fast." Ps. 33:6-9.
    STUDY HELPS: R. E. Hoen, "The Creator and His Workshop," chapter 3;
"Patriarchs and Prophets," chapter 1; "The Great Controversy," chapter 29; "The
Story of Redemption," pages 13-19, 24-27, 1947 edition.
    INTRODUCTION: The fact of the existence of the universe is adequate evidence
of a Creator (Rom. 1:20), and no created being is justified in questioning the wisdom
or judgment of that Creator (Isa. 29:16; 45:9; Rom. 9:20). But Lucifer, the cover-
ing cherub, permitted his jealousy of the Son of God to rise to the point of rebellion
when he was not consulted concerning the plans for the creation of man upon the earth.

                          DAILY STUDY ASSIGNMENT
   1.   General survey of the lesson.               "The Creator and His Work-
   2.   Questions 1-4.                              shop."
   3.   Questions 5, 6; memorize Ps. 33 :6, 9. 6. Read  selections from one of the
   4.   Questions 7-9.                              lesson helps.
                                               7. Read selections from another lesson
   5.   Questions 10-13. Read Chapter 3,            help. Review lesson.

        Origin of the Universe and of the Hosts of Heaven
   1. Who was the Creator of the universe? Out of what were
the worlds made? Col. 1:13, 15-17; Heb. 11:3; Ps. 33:6, 9-

     NOTE.—Weymouth's translation of the last part of Hebrews 11:3 reads,
"What is seen does not owe its existence to that which is visible." All evolu-
tionary hypotheses for the origin of the earth assume the material to be
already existent. Evolutionists speculate on how what is came from what was:
creationists believe that what is was created from what was not. Only an
infinite Creator can bring matter into existence, and He only can annihilate
it. In the words of a familiar hymn, "Know that the Lord is God alone, He
can create, and He destroy." Matter does not spontaneously evolve. No
philosophy other than Christianity clarifies the problem of fundamental
origins. The substance composing the physical bodies of the universe is the
materialized product of omnipotent energy. "The theory that God did not
create matter when He brought the world into existence is without founda-
tion. In the formation of our world, God was not indebted to pre-existing
matter. On the contrary, all things, material or spiritual, stood up before the
Lord Jehovah at His voice and were created for His own purpose. The heav-
ens and all the host of them, the earth and all things therein, are not only
the work of His hand; they came into existence by the breath of His mouth."
 —Testimonies, vol. 8, pp. 258, 259. See also The Ministry of Healing, pages
414, 415.
   2. How much of the universe was included in the plan and
accomplishment of creation? Gen. 1:1; Heb. 1:2; Col. 1:16.
                                          f 9]
  3. Whence came the angels? What are some of their duties
and privileges? Neh. 9:6; Heb. 1:14; Ps. 103:20, 21; 148:2.

   NOTE.—"The Father wrought by His Son in the creation of all heavenly
beings. 'By Him were all things created, . . . whether they be thrones, or
dominions, or principalities, or powers. All things were created by Him and
for Him.' Angels are God's ministers, radiant with the light ever flowing
from His presence, and speeding on rapid wing to execute His will."—Patri-
archs and Prophets, page 34.

                   Lucifer Jealous of the Creator
    4. What was the origin of Lucifer? What character and person-
ality did he possess originally? Ezek. 28:12, 13, 15-17.

   5. What position did Lucifer occupy? Ezek. 28:14, 15; Isa. 14:12.

   NorE.—"Sin originated with him, who, next to Christ, had been most
honored of God, and was highest in power and glory among the inhabitants
of heaven. Lucifer, 'son of the morning,' was first of the covering cherubs,
holy and undefiled."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 35. See also The Great
Controversy, pages 493, 494 (new ed., pp. 560, 561).
   6. What was the crowning act of Creation? Gen. 1:26; 2:7.

   Norc.—"In all the counsels of God, Christ was a participant, while Lucifer
was not permitted thus to enter into the divine purposes. 'Why,' questioned
this mighty angel, 'should Christ have the supremacy? Why is He thus
honored above Lucifer?'"—The Great Controversy, page 495. "And I saw
that when God said to His Son, Let Us make man in Our image, Satan was
jealous of Jesus. He wished to be consulted concerning the formation of man.
He was filled with envy, jealousy, and hatred. He wished to be the highest
in heaven, next to God, and receive the highest honors."—Spiritual Gifts,
1858 ed., vol. 1, p. 17.
                       The Rebellion in Heaven
   7. How ambitious were Lucifer's plans for rebellion? Isa. 14:
13, 14.

    8. Who were associated with Lucifer in rebellion? 2 Peter 2:4,
first part; Jude 6; Rev. 12:7-9.

   NOTE.—"God's government included not only the inhabitants of heaven,
but of all the worlds that He had created; and Satan thought that if he could
carry the angels of heaven with him in rebellion, he could carry also the other
worlds."—The Great Controversy, page 497.
   9. What are some of the names by which Lucifer has been
                                     [10]
known since his fall? What are his angels called? Rev. 20:2; Matt.
12:24; John 12:31; Eph. 2:2.

  10. What was the result of Lucifer's rebellion? Why was Satan
not destroyed when he was cast out of heaven? Luke 10:18.

    NoTE.—"Even when it was decided that he could no longer remain in
heaven, Infinite Wisdom did not destroy Satan. . . . The inhabitants of
heaven and of other worlds, being unprepared to comprehend the nature or
consequences of sin, could not then have seen the justice and mercy of God
in the destruction of Satan."—The Great Controversy, pages 498, 499.

                          Creation Continued
   11. After the expulsion of Satan from heaven, what creative
plan was carried out?

   ANSWER: —"The Son of God and true, loyal angels prevailed; and Satan
and his sympathizers were expelled from heaven. . . . The Father consulted
His Son in regard to at once carrying out Their purpose to make man to
inhabit the earth. . . . The Father and Son carried out Their purpose, which
was designed before the fall of Satan, to make man in Their own image."—
The Story of Redemption, 1947 ed., pp. 19, 20.
   12. How long was the Creator engaged in the creation of the
earth? Ex. 20:11; Gen. 2:2, 3.

  13. Is creation a present-day process on this earth? Gen. 2:1;
Heb. 4:3, last part.

    NoTE.—Creation is an accomplished work. No greater error has ever been
proposed by men than that basic thesis of all evolutionists, namely, that cre-
ation is a current, present-day process. 2 Peter 3:3, 4 correctly prophesied the
appearance in the last days of a doctrine that should claim that "all things
continue as they were from the beginning of the creation" (not as from the
end of it), in a continuous uniformitarian process of creation or organization.
Sabbathkeeping is a testimony against such error, a sign of recognition of the
true God who "in six days .. . made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that
in them is," and finished that work "from the foundation of the world." See
Education, pages 130, 131; Patriarchs and Prophets, page 115.

                        Lesson 4, for July 28, 1951

                      Creation: Light and Air
    MEMORY VERSE: "The day is Thine, the night also is Thine: Thou hast pre-
pared the light and the sun. Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: Thou hast
made summer and winter." Ps. 74:16, 17.
    STUDY HELPS: Job 38:1-21; R. E. Hoen, "The Creator and His Workshop,"
chapter 4.
    INTRODUCTION: "As an educating power the Bible is without a rival. No
scientific works are so well adapted to develop the mind as a contemplation of the great
and vital truths and practical lessons of the Bible. . . . Men of the greatest intellects,
if not guided by the word of God in their research, become bewildered; they cannot
comprehend the Creator or His works....
    "The Bible is the most instructive and comprehensive history that has ever been
given to the world. Its sacred pages contain the only authentic account of the creation.
Here we behold the power that 'stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundation
of the earth.' Here we have a truthful history of the human race, one that is unmarred
by human prejudice or human pride."—"Fundamentals of Christian Education," pages
84, 85.
    On the first and second days the creative process included arrangements in the
physical, inorganic realm as part of the necessary prelude for the accommodation of
living things upon the earth.

                        DAILY STUDY ASSIGNMENT
   I. General survey of the lesson.    5. Questions 10-12. Read chapter 4,
   2. Questions 1-4.                        "The Creator and His Work-
   3. Questions 5, 6; memorize Ps. 74:      shop."
        16, 17.                        6. Read Job 38:1-21.
   4. Questions 7-9.                   7. Review lesson.

                     The Establishment of the Earth
   1. Upon what support does the earth rest? Job 38:6; 26:7.

    Nom.—Jehovah asked a pertinent question to emphasize Job's previous
admission of the fact that no material substance holds the earth in its path
through space. The omnipotence of the Creator, displayed in this instance
through His universal laws of gravitation and momentum, controls the move-
ments of the earth and of all other celestial bodies. "The hand that sustains
the worlds in space, the hand that holds in their orderly arrangement and
tireless activity all things throughout the universe of God, is the hand that
was nailed to the cross for us."—Education, page 132. "The material world
is under God's control. The laws of nature are obeyed by nature. Everything
speaks and acts the will of the Creator."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 81.
Compare The Acts of the Apostles, page 472.
   2. In what condition was the earth when first created? With
what was it surrounded? What made it dark? Gen. 1:2; Ps. 104:
5, 6; Job 38:4, 9; Prov. 8:27, 28.

   NOTE.—As the earth was brought into existence by the Creator, it was com-
pletely covered with "the deep as with a garment: the waters stood above
                                  [ 12]
the mountains." The water in turn was enveloped with saturated water vapor
and clouds that excluded the light. Thus was "cloud the garment thereof,
and thick darkness a swaddling band for it." As the first week of time for
this earth began, the Holy Spirit in creative power "moved upon the face
of the waters" that surrounded it.
  3. Who, besides the creative Trinity, witnessed the establish-
ment of the earth? Job 38:6, 7.
                        The Advent of Light
  4. As an introduction to the first day of creation week, what
was permitted to penetrate the darkness that surrounded the earth?
Gen. 1:3-5.

   NOTE.—In view of the fact that the Bible, and in particular the Genesis
record, is concerned with the earth and its inhabitants, this Scripture may
well be read with its evident meaning, "Let there be light [upon the earth]:
and there was light [upon the earth]."
   5. What were the conditions of the light and dark portions of
the earth called? As light was caused to shine upon the surface
of the rotating earth, what system of time reckoning was thereupon
established for it? Gen. 1:4, 5, 8, 13, 19, 23, 31.   -

    Nam.—From the record it is clear that one part of the earth was illumined
while the other part was dark, for "God divided the light from the darkness."
As the light penetrated the "swaddling band" (Job 38:9) of darkness on one
side of the rotating earth, thus distinguishing daylight from darkness, an
epoch was established which resulted in a series of "evening-morning" days
of corresponding character that has been unbroken ever since. The initiation
of this differential illumination of a rotating earth was the beginning of days
and of time reckoning for this world. It is noteworthy that "day" (light)
and "night" (darkness) are separate but simultaneous on opposite sides of
the earth. On the other hand, "evening" and "morning are a sequence which
marks off each full day period for any particular locality on the earth. In
order that there be an uninterrupted continuity of days, weeks, and Sabbaths
from the beginning of time, it is important that the direction of that source
of light which was permitted to reach the earth on the first day must have
been the same as it has been for every one of all the other days which have
since elapsed, and that the period of rotation of the earth has remained sub-
stantially invariable ever since that day. See Job 38:12-14. "Like the Sab-
bath, the week originated at creation, and it has been preserved and brought
down to us through Bible history. God Himself measured off the first week
as a sample for successive weeks to the close of time. Like every other, it
 consisted of seven literal days. . . . Of each successive day of creation, the
 Sacred Record declares that it consisted of the evening and the morning, like
 all other days that have followed."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pages 111, 112.
 "When the Lord declares that He made the world in six days and rested
 on the seventh day, He means the day of twenty-four hours, which He has
 marked off by the rising and setting of the sun."—Testimonies to Ministers,
 page 136.
                                         13 ]
                Introduction of the Atmosphere
   6. What is the "firmament" which was created on the second
day? Of what service is the firmament? Gen. 1:6-8, 20; Prov. 8:27,
28, A.R.V.; Isa. 40:22.

    NorE.—The heaven designated as the firmament is the atmosphere or sky
in which the birds "may fly," "a tent to dwell in" for much of the animal
creation. Within and above a part of this atmospheric covering of the earth,
water is held as vapor, diffuse particles of water and ice, and more dense
clouds. Without a permanent gaseous atmosphere (compare firmament, a
fixed or established expanse), the earth would be surrounded with a region
of saturated water vapor. This water vapor would partially condense instantly
upon cooling ever so slightly, and conversely the amount of vapor would be
augmented by equally rapid evaporation upon increase of temperature. The
temperate, though variable, weather conditions established upon the earth
are dependent upon the wise provision of this atmospheric barrier which
retards the rate of evaporation and likewise delays precipitation of moisture
condensed as fog, cloud, mist, or rain. Without the resistance of the air, water
drops falling from a mile high would have a speed of more than five hundred
feet a second, and would produce an impact sufficient to destroy most forms
of life upon the surface of the earth. Truly, the firmament "divided the waters
which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the
firmament."

                    Lessons From the Light
  7. What is the power of Satan called? In contrast, what is
Christ said to be? Acts 26:18; John 1:4, 9; Ps. 27:1.

   8. What accompanies spiritual light? Ps. 27:1; John 1:7, 9.

   9. What words are used to describe those who have accepted
the light of the gospel? What blessings accompany the reception
of that light? 1 Peter 2:9; Acts 26:18.

10. What functions should Christians serve in the world?
Whose light will they bear? Acts 13:47; Matt. 5:14, 16.

                    Lessons From the Atmosphere
  11. What acquaintance did Job have with the comparatively
modern scientific discovery that air has weight? For what pur-
poses does God employ the wind as an agent? Job 28:25; Ps.
135:7; 147:17, 18.

   12. In what way is the work of the Holy Spirit likened to the
action of the wind? John 3:8.
                                     [14]
    NoTE.—"While the wind is itself invisible, it produces effects that are seen
and felt. So the work of the Spirit upon the soul will reveal itself in every
act of him who has felt its saving power. When the Spirit of God takes
possession of the heart, it transforms the life."—The Desire of Ages, page 173.
    "Every soul is surrounded by an atmosphere of its own,—an atmosphere,
it may be, charged with the life-giving power of faith, courage, and hope, and
sweet with the fragrance of love. Or it may be heavy and chill with the gloom
of discontent and selfishness, or poisonous with the deadly taint of cherished
sin. By the atmosphere surrounding us, every person with whom we come
in contact is consciously or unconsciously affected."—Christ's Object Lessons,
page 339.

                       Lesson 5, for August 4, 1951
                      Creation: Sea and Land
    MEMORY VERSE: "Who bath measured the waters in the hollow of His hand,
and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a
measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?" Isa. 40:12.
    STUDY HELPS: R. E. Hoen, "The Creator and His Workshop," chapter 5;
"Patriarchs and Prophets," ch. 2, p. 44; Job 26:7-12; Ps. 104:1-13.
    INTRODUCTION: The first of the creative activities of the third day resulted
in the completion of the physical features of the earth so that living things could dwell
upon its entire varied surface. Initially, as of the first day, there was water in which
entirely aquatic creatures could live. The introduction of an atmosphere on the second
day provided a habitat for part-time existence of birds. The uprising of land areas on
the third day completed provision of a place for land animals as well as for most plants
and for birds and amphibians. The work of this day marked the close of the physio-
graphic phase of creation.
                          DAILY STUDY ASSIGNMENT

                 Separation of Land and Water Areas
   1. At the close of the second day of creation, what still covered
the entire earth? Gen. 1:2, 7, 9; Ps. 104:5, 6.

   2. What redistribution of land and water was made on the
third day? Gen. 1:9, 10; Ps. 95:5.

  3. What differences in the earth's surface did the Creator pro-
duce to accomplish this separation? Ps. 104:6-8, margin; 65:6.

   NOTE:The creative act which resulted in the separation of land and
water is vividly described in Ps.104:8, A.R.V.,"The mountains rose, the valleys
sank down unto the place which Thou hadst founded for them." Into the
                                          [ 15 ]
depressions between elevated portions of the earth, the water collected to
form seas within fixed bounds.
   4. What names were given to the land and water areas? Gen.
1:10.

   5. How were the continental and other land boundaries estab-
lished? What did the Creator provide to keep the seas from over-
flowing the earth? Prov. 8:27-29, A.R.V.; Jer. 5:22; Job 38:11.

   6. When the distribution of land and water on the third day
was completed, how did the mountains, valleys, and seas compare
with those existing now? Gen. 1:10, last clause.

    NOTE.—"As the earth came forth from the hand of its Maker, it was
exceedingly beautiful. Its surface was diversified with mountains, hills, and
plains, interspersed with noble rivers and lovely lakes; but the hills and
mountains were not abrupt and rugged, abounding in terrific steeps and
frightful chasms, as they now do ; the sharp, ragged edges of earth's rocky
framework were buried beneath the fruitful soil, which everywhere produced
a luxuriant growth of verdure. There were no loathsome swamps nor barren
deserts."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 44. Evidently, no part of the earth
was then far from a body of water, and no sea was as extensive as are the
present ones.
                          Functions of Water
    7. How was the earth watered originally? What system of
water circulation was established? Gen. 2:5, 6, 10-14; Ps. 104:10,
11, 13.
    NOTE.—Even at present, certain regions of the earth are watered in part
by a mist which condenses abundantly upon the foliage at night in sufficient
quantity to water the ground itself. The water vapor which supplies the
moisture for dew and fog is gently wind-borne from the nearby seas or lakes.
Under Edenic conditions the rise of a mist and its return to the seas by first
watering "the whole face of the ground," then collecting in springs and
streams on its way to the sea, was ample provision for watering the earth.
   8. Why does not the sea become overfilled? Eccl. 1:7; Jer. 51:16.

   NoTE.—The great cycle of evaporation of water at lower levels and con-
densation of it as mist or other forms of precipitation to supply streams at
higher levels is a highly efficient system of irrigation and air conditioning
which the Creator established. Without it the maintenance of life would be
impossible.
   9. What services do rivers perform? Gen. 2:10; Ezek. 31:3-5.

  10. For what use was the sea intended? Gen. 1:20, 21; Ps. 104:
25, 26.
                                    [ 16 ]
    NoTE.—Besides being the most abundant liquid on earth, water is a unique
substance which shows to a remarkable degree the omniscient plan of the
Creator. It has a higher heat capacity for its weight than any other common
substance, and it is therefore a superb equalizer of temperature for the earth.
It is fluid, and can therefore convey heat to or from various regions as neces-
sary. It is very nearly a universal solvent. Its greatest density is at about
seven degrees F. (four degrees C.) above its freezing point, consequently the
water in deep lakes and oceans is always warmer than ice water. It also
expands upon freezing, so ice always is formed at the top of rivers and lakes
first, thus further protecting the living creatures below it. The ice formed on
the top surface becomes a continuous solid bridge on the water for travel
or recreation. Were any or all of these characteristics otherwise,—and they
are for most other liquids,—water would not be the valuable substance it is.
Had man been planning its creation, he certainly would not have anticipated
and made available in one substance so many desirable functions as did the
Creator in the marvelous water which to a casual observer is so commonplace.
   11. To whom do the seas and the rivers belong? Ps. 95:5.

                             Dry Land and Hills
   12. Of what value are the hills and mountains to man and beast?
Ps. 104:10-13, 18; Job 40:15, 20; 39:5, 8; Deut. 8:9.

   13. How enduring are the hills commonly thought to be? Hab.
3:6; Deut. 33:15.

   14. How do mighty seas and massive mountains compare with
the greatness and power of the Creator? Isa. 40:12, 15; Micah 1:4.


                     Lesson 6, for August 11, 1951

                         Creation: Plant Life
   MEMORY VERSE: "He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for
the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth." Ps. 104:14.
  STUDY HELPS: R. E. Hoen, "The Creator and His Workshop," chapter 6;
"Christ's Object Lessons," pages 62-69 (new ed., p. 61-67).
    INTRODUCTION: The importance of the first living forms upon the earth can-
not be overestimated. Only the Creator has ever made a living organism, or even a
single cell of such an organism. Without the products of life as starting materials,
man has never fabricated a single one of the essential organic substances necessary to
the formation or nutrition of even the simplest forms of plant or animal life. At times,
fantastic reports have been current that some experimenter has produced a cell or an
organism possessing the properties of life. Closer investigation reveals that only the
semblance of such cells or organisms have resulted from the experiments. Certain
features of structure or appearance or possibly of behavior may resemble in some ways
those of living forms, but the powers of nutrition, sensitivity, choice, co-ordination,
and of reproduction after their kinds are uniquely reserved by the omniscient CreatOr
for the living creatures of His own handiwork.
    Frequently also reports claim for man the achievement of food synthesis from the
                                          [ 17 ]
elements. Here again, intimate familiarity with the procedures employed reveals the
ultimate and absolute dependence of the chemist upon the products and processes
found only in living plants for certain otherwise insurmountable steps in the prepara-
tion of his product. Finally, were he to achieve the impossible results claimed, it still
must be remembered that the efforts of man himself are but the product of a life
that is God-given, not spontaneously evolved.

                     The First Vegetation
   1. What acts climaxed the creative work of the third day? Gen.
1:11-13.

   2. From what were the plants formed? Gen. 2:9.

   NorE.—Throughout the creation record it is stated definitely at each new
step that the material substance previously brought into existence by the
Creator was employed by Him in the organization of the diversified forms
placed upon the earth. The great Master Builder planned the earth, created
the substance of which it was to consist, and, finally, from portions of the
substance of earth thus created, He formed plants, animals, and man.

                    Purposes of Plant Life
   3. What was one of the material purposes of the creation of
plants? Gen. 1:29, 30.

    NOTE.—"The plant does not germinate, grow, or bring forth fruit for
itself, but to 'give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater.' "—Christ's Object
Lessons, page 67.
   4. What unique power do plants possess? Ps. 104:14.

    NoTE.—Plants were created to be the immediate source of all food. Upon
them as a group was bestowed the special ability to manufacture food from
substances unusable for animal nutrition. In the process known as photosyn-
thesis (literally, manufacture by light), sunlight furnishes the power to operate
tiny living machines in the cells of plants. With the aid of the green sub-
stance, chlorophyll in these cells, carbon dioxide from the air, together with
water, is fabricated into sugars. From these and certain minerals from the
soil, other processes in the plant produce all the essential organic items required
for the growth and maintenance both of plants and animals. The creative
plan was in perfect sequence: First, light essential to photosynthesis, next
the air containing the carbon dioxide, then land and water distribution to
furnish habitats for plants and animals; after that plants to produce food,
then the animals, and finally, man to have dominion over them all.
                                       [ 18]
   5. In what other ways were plants to contribute to man's en-
joyment? Gen. 2:9, first part.

    NOTE.—"Graceful shrubs and delicate flowers greeted the eye at every
turn. The heights were crowned with trees more majestic than any that now
exist. . . . The entire landscape outvied in beauty the decorated grounds of
the proudest palace.... After the earth with its teeming animal and vegetable
life, had been called into existence, man, the crowning work of the Creator,
and the one for whom the beautiful earth had been fitted up, was brought
upon the stage of action." "There were lovely vines, growing upright, yet
presenting a most graceful appearance, with their branches drooping under
their load of tempting fruit, of the richest and most varied hues. . . . There
were fragrant flowers of every hue in rich profusion."—Patriarchs and Proph-
ets, pages 44, 47.
   6. In what ways were the birds to derive benefits from the
plants? Ps. 104:16, 17.

                         The Source of All Life
   7. What powers were given by the Creator to the plants as well
as to all other living creatures? Gen. 1:11, 12; Gal. 6:7; James 3:12.


     NOTE.—While there is extensive variation producing varieties, races, and
species of plants and animals, reproduction among living things is, and always
has been, restricted to the limits imposed at creation, "After their kind." This
is a cornerstone of creationist doctrine. Extravagant claims to the contrary
have been made at times, but diligent research in support of evolutionistic
philosophy has in no case revealed a single authentic transition of any living
form across the boundaries which separate the "kinds" of plants or animals
from each other. Through hundreds and thousands of generations, wheat
is still wheat, and roses, lilies, oaks, and pines produce only their own kind.
Were it otherwise, seedsmen and farmers would be in a sad dilemma, unable
to anticipate the character of a crop. Neither the Creator nor His creation
is capricious.
    "In the laws of God in nature, effect follows cause with unerring certainty.
... Every seed sown produces a harvest of its kind."—Christ's Object Lessons,
page 84.
  8. Whence is the source of the reproductive power of the plant?
Gen. 1:11, 12.

   NOTE.—"God created the seed, as He created the earth, by His word. By
His word He gave it power to grow and multiply. He said, 'Let the earth
bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after
his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so. ... And God
saw that it was good.' It is that word which still causes the seed to grow.
Every seed that sends up its green blade to the sunlight declares the wonder-
working power of that word uttered by Him who `spake, and it was;' who
`commanded, and it stood fast.' "—Christ's Object Lessons, pages 80, 81.
                                      [ 19 ]
    9. Upon whom is plant life dependent for the continuance of
its existence? Ps. 147:7, 8; 104:14, 16.

   10. What modern doctrine has been developed which denies
the creation of the various "kinds" of living forms? In what words
did the Scriptures predict the appearance of such teachings? 2 Peter
3:3, 4.

    NoTE.—The Scriptural teaching is that "the works were finished from the
foundation of the world," and therefore that all things continue as from the
end of the creation, not "as they were from the beginning of the creation."
There is taught in schools and from pulpits the doctrine that creation is still
in progress, thereby denying that completion of which the Sabbath is a memo-
rial. The evolutionistic philosophy of the present day evades entirely the
question of ultimate origins. Its proponents presume the existence of the
material of the universe to begin with, and thereafter the spontaneous origin
of one or a few simple plant or animal forms. They then devote their efforts
to the upbuilding of a hypothetical sequence of forms which culminate pur-
portedly in those complex and varied organisms which now inhabit the earth.
But despite this, the most ardent evolutionists affirm repeatedly in their
literature that life results only from antecedent life. The Holy Writ contains
the only answer ever proposed for the origin of matter and of terrestrial life;
that God, the ever-living Creator, infused portions of the matter which He
had previously created with that intangible, invaluable property, life. "In
Him was life; and the life was the light of men." John 1:4.
                    The Relation of Plants to Man
   11. Of what educational value were the plants to be? Matt. 6:
28-30.
    NOTE.—"They [Adam and Eve] held converse with leaf and flower and
tree, gathering from each the secrets of its life."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
page 51.
   12. What part was man to have in the care of plants? Gen. 2:15.

    NOTE.—"It was the work of Adam and Eve to train the branches of the
vine to form bowers, thus making for themselves a dwelling from living
trees covered with foliage and fruit."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 47.
   13. What co-operation must exist between the efforts of man
and God? 1 Cor. 3:7-9.

    NoTE.—"In everything that tends to the sustenance of man is seen the
concurrence of divine and human effort. There can be no reaping unless
the human hand acts its part in the sowing of the seed. But without the
agencies which God provides in giving sunshine and showers, dew and clouds,
there would be no increase.... Whenever man accomplishes anything, whether
in spiritual or in temporal lines, he should bear in mind that he does it through
co-operation with his Maker."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 82.

                       Lessons From tile Plants
    MEMORY VERSE: "Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but
a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. . . Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know
them." Matt. 7:17-20.
    STUDY HELPS: R. E. Hoen, "The Creator and His Workshop," chapter 7;
"Christ's Object Lessons," pages 33-89 (new ed., pp. 27-91).
    INTRODUCTION: No comparison or illustration can adequately represent every
phase of the original which it is intended to depict, else it would be the original itself.
Consequently, it is necessary to employ many illustrations or parables in order to
portray a great and complex truth. Christ's parables are unsurpassed because they
were so chosen that the parallelism between the truth and the figure is perfect for
the particular aspect illustrated by any specific parable. Each parable enhances the
pattern of one's understanding of the truth as it is in Christ Jesus. In our efforts to
illustrite spiritual truth by reference to facts in the natural world, care must be exer-
cised to represent those facts accurately. When, by the figure of the wild olive scion
on the good olive tree, Paul illustrated how the Gentiles became partakers of the gospel,
he recognized (Rom. 11:24) that in the natural world the scion, not the root, deter-
mines the character of the fruit, and that his parable required explanation and modifi-
cation. God's modem messengers should be as careful as was Paul. The illustration
itself should correctly state the behavior of nature, and the parallelism of the symbol
and its lesson should be made unmistakably clear and truthful.

                  Nature, a Lesson Book
  1. What method of teaching did Christ commonly employ?
From what source were many of His parables taken? Matt. 13:
34, 35.

   2. What spiritual lessons did Christ teach from the lily? Matt.
6:28-30.

   NorE.—Christ would have not only the delicacy and beauty of the lilies
admired; He also would have attention directed to the marvelous and intri-
cate physiology of the lilies—how they grow, and how remarkably the Creator
has made provision for their nourishment and protection, though "they toil
not, neither do they spin."
   3. What further lesson of dependence upon the Creator comes
from seed sowing? 1 Cor. 3:7.

   4. How are the development and advance of the kingdom of
heaven illustrated? Luke 13:18, 19.
                                             21
  5. How do plants illustrate the gradual work of grace and
Christian education? Mark 4:26-28.

   NOTE.—"The gradual development of the plant from the seed is an object
lesson in child training. There is 'first the blade, then the ear, after that
the full corn in the ear.' "—Christ's Object Lessons, page 82.
                   Christian Virtues Exemplified
  6. How is the apparently insignificant but quiet and effective
operation of faith illustrated? Matt. 17:20.

    Nom.—The power of the mustard seed is twofold; it must co-ordinate
its efforts with the power of the Creator. An obstinate, rebellious seed in an
environment favorable for growth would soon become a faithless and power-
less bit of decaying dust. Seeds are co-operative, men also should be willing
to proceed, even if ever so slowly, by faith in their Creator.

  7. What lesson of perfection may be learned from the plants?
Matt. 6:28, 29.

   8. How is Christian liberality taught by seed sowing? 2 Cor.
9:6, 7.

   9. By what parable did Jotham, the son of Gideon, illustrate
the principles of proper choice of leadership? Judges 9:7-21.

                     The Nature of the Harvest
   10. How is the harvest related to the seed sown? Gal. 6:7;
Prov. 22:8.

   NorE.—"The sowing of the seed carries the mind to spiritual seed-sowing.
The tree declares that a good tree cannot bear evil fruit, neither can an evil
tree bear good fruit. 'Ye shall know them by their fruits.' Matthew 7:16.
Even the tares have a lesson. They are of Satan's sowing, and, if left un-
checked, spoil the wheat by their rank growth."—Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 326.
   11. By what illustration did Paul show the proviiion made for
the salvation of the Gentiles? What lesson of humility is therein
taught? Rom. 11:13, 17-21, 23, 24.

12. How is the relation of the individual to Christ illustrated?
What is the test of discipleship? John 15:1-8, 16.

   NOTE.—The lesson here taught is similar to that portrayed by Paul (Rom.
11:13-24). The engrafting of inferior branches on a good stock is "contrary
to nature," and thus this parable portrays the branches as bearing good and
                                    [ 22 ]
much fruit only through an intimate contact with the True Vine. The divine
Husbandman finds it necessary to prune away not only that which is bad and
inferior, but also the superfluity of apparently good things in the life of the
Christian in order that more and better fruit may be borne. The question
often asked, "Are not these particular things harmless and legitimate?" must
be restated in the experience of the Christian branch, "Are the things thAt
I desire really necessary, and do they promote fruit bearing for the kingdom?"


                      Lesson 8, for August 25, 1951

     Creation: the Solar System and the Seasons
    MEMORY' VERSE: "When I consider Thy heavens, the work of Thy fingers,
the moon and the stars, which Thou hast ordained; what is man, that Thou art mind-
ful of him? and the son of man, that Thou visitest him?" Ps. 8:3, 4.
    STUDY HELPS: R. E. Hoen, "The Creator and His Workshop," chapter 8;
"The Great Controversy," pages 677, 678, 306-309, 333, 334 (new ed., pp. 761, 762,
350-354, 382-384); "Education," pages 115, 116; "Early Writings," page 41.
    INTRODUCTION: In relative distance from the earth, the first heaven is the
firmament, the lower portion of which is now commonly known as the atmosphere, in
which the birds "may fly above the earth" (Gen. 1:20), and from which the rain falls
(Acts 14:17). In the next or starry heaven entirely apart from the earth and yet
closely related to it are found the moon, the other planets of the solar system, the sun,
and, at still greater distances, the stars (1 Chron. 27:23; Heb. 11:12). These latter
are grouped in apparent patterns or constellations and in enormous clusters, galaxies,
and nebulae, very remote from each other. The sun of our solar system is a member
of one of these giant galaxies, called the Milky Way. Then, much as the planets revolve
about the sun, all of these systems move in response to the force emanating from the
great center of the universe, the third heaven (2 Cor. 12:2), the heaven of heavens
(1 Kings 8:27), where is the throne of God, the Creator and Upholder of all (Isa.
66:1; Matt. 5:34). On the fourth day, as on all the other days of creation week,
certain portions of the matter which the Creator had brought into existence initially
were organized in final form according to His great blueprint. The material selected
on this day He "ordained" and "appointed" as objects to serve in the realm of the
second heaven as the rulers of day and night, and of seasons and years for this earth.

                                           7. Review.

                            The Sun and the Moon
   1. On the fourth day of creation week what further organiza-
tion of created matter was accomplished? Gen. 1:14-19.

    NOTE.—The divine command was for lights to appear "in the firmament
of the heaven" on this day.
   2. What words signifying a purposeful arrangement are used
to describe the creative act of establishing the functions of the sun,
                                         [23 1
moon, and stars relative to the earth? Ps. 8:3; 104:19; Jer. 31:35;
33:25.

   3. For what distinctive activities were the two great lights
ordained or appointed? Gen. 1:16, 18; Ps. 104:19; 136:7-9.

    NorE.—It is indicated in the Scriptures that the chief function assigned
to the bodies known as the sun and moon was that of definite, exact marking
of days, of seasons, and of years.
    "When the Lord declares that He made the world in six days and rested
on the seventh day, He means the day of twenty-four hours, which He has
marked off by the rising and setting of the sun."—Testimonies to Ministers,
page 136.
    "I was then carried back to the creation and was shown that the first week,
in which God performed the work of creation in six days and rested on the
seventh day, was just like every other week. The great God in His days of
creation and day of rest, measured off the first cycle as a sample for succes-
sive weeks till the close of time."—Spiritual Gifts, vol. 3, p. 90. Compare
Patriarchs and Prophets, pages 111, 112.
   4. When and how were seasons established? How long were
they thus to continue? Gen. 1:14; 8:22; Ps. 74:16, 17.

    NorE.—The record clearly states that the heavenly bodies were to be the
timekeepers for man, constituting the great clock of the ages. By appropriate
phase changes, but without producing the present extremes of cold and heat,
drought and humidity, these bodies were to be the signs for the identification
of seasons, days, and years. "After their sin, Adam and Eve were no longer
to dwell in Eden.... In humility and unutterable sadness they bade farewell
to their beautiful home, and went forth to dwell upon the earth, where rested
the curse of sin. The atmosphere, once so mild and uniform in temperature,
was now subject to marked changes, and the Lord mercifully provided them
with a garment of skins as .a protection from the extremes of heat and cold."
—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 61.
   5. What agency did the Creator ordain for the communication
of light to earth? Of what further practical use to man are the
sun and moon? Jer. 31:35; Deut. 33:13, 14; Ps. 19:4, 6; 104:22, 23.

   NOTE.—By means of the sun, God conveys to man light, beauty, health,
and, most important, all the energy required for activities on the earth in
waterfalls, in the breezes, and in the products of plant and animal life.
                   The Stars and Their Functions
  6. Who created all the myriads of stars? Name some of the stars
and star groups. Ps. 33:6; Job 38:31-33, margin and A.R.V.

    NOTE.—Orion is one of the most extensive and magnificent constellations.
Its extent is entirely beyond any comparison with the size of the earth, of
the sun, or of the entire solar system. Even the nebula, which is but a part
                                    [ 24 ]
of this constellation, contains untold stars larger than the sun, and aptly has
been named the "corridor to the throne of glory." Arcturus is a giant among
the stars, about thirty times as large in diameter as the sun. "Mazzaroth"
could well have been translated, "The twelve signs of the zodiac," which
constitute a belt of star groups around the heavens along the apparent path
of the sun and the moon. Surely One who created all these and millions more
is deserving of the admiration and worship of every dweller on this puny earth.
   7. What services were the stars to perform? Ps. 136:9; 148:3;
Jer. 31:35.

    NoTE.—"The sun to rule by day, ... the moon and stars to rule by night,"
and "the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night," con-
stitute a clarifying commentary on Genesis 1:16. It is to be noted that the
words "He made" are additions to the original text, so that the latter part
of the verse may well read, And God made ... the lesser light—the stars also
—to rule the night.
                   Worship of the Host of Heaven
   8. What idolatrous customs through the years have evidenced
man's attempt to transfer worship from the Creator, the ultimate
source of energy, to the sun and stars, the secondary sources? Ezek.
8:15, 16; Job 31:26-28.

  9. What warnings have been given against the worship of
heavenly bodies? Deut. 4:15, 19; Jer. 8:2.

    NorE.—All forms of worship of the creature instead of the Creator are
strongly denounced in the Scriptures. Probably no form of idolatry has
attracted so many followers as the worship of the "host of heaven" and, in
particular, the worship of the sun and the moon. See Acts 7:41-43; Amos
5:26, 27; 2 Kings 17:16. In these present days one form of pagan sun wor-
ship is perpetuated in Sunday worship, against which the message of Revela-
tion 14:7 is pronounced.
   10. How is the futility of idol worship vividly portrayed by
the prophets? Isa. 44:9-20; Jer. 10:2-5.

   11. By contrast, who only is deserving of worship and adora-
tion, and who only guides the destiny of mankind? Isa. 40:18-26;
Jer. 10:11, 12; Ps. 115:2-9.

   12. Why did not God show His person to Israel at Horeb or
at any other time? Deut. 4:15, 16, 19; Ex. 20:4-6.

                    Lesson 9, for September 1, 1951

                       Lessons From the Stars
    MEMORY VERSE: "Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who bath created
these things, that bringeth out their host by number: He calleth them all by names
by the greatness of His might, for that He is strong in power; not one faileth." Isa.
40:26.
    STUDY HELPS: R. E. Hoen, "The Creator and His Workshop," chapter 9;
"The Ministry of Healing," pages 416, 417; "The Desire of Ages," pages 464, 465.
    INTRODUCTION: In the precision of the movements of the heavenly bodies
is epitomized the exactitude of the Creator and Sustainer of the universe. Therein
is revealed the grand principle that "the laws of nature are the mathematical thoughts
of God." With Him there "is no variableness, neither shadow of turning." As His
children contemplate His handiwork in terms of cause and effect, of absolute depend-
ability and infinite precision, they will recognize the grandeur and providence, as well
as the beauty, of God's work in nature. On a plaque in the lobby of the observatory
on Mount Hamilton, California, is the following inscription:
                                  "James Edward Keeler
                          Director Lick Observatory 1890-1900
                      Surveyed God's beauteous firmament unrolled
                       Like to a book new writ in golden words,
                      And turned the azure scroll with reverent hand
                      And read to man the wonders God bath wrought."

   4. Questions 7-9. Review first part of
        lesson.

                    The Creator: the Only True God
  1. What messages do the heavenly bodies convey? Ps. 19:1-5,
margin; Rom. 10:18.

   NorE.—While the natural world does not employ the vocabulary of
any race of mankind, it speaks none the less distinctly of the glory of God.
Without speech or language in the ordinary sense, "their line [sound] is
gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world."
Christ, the Creator, is "the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh
into the world." John 1:9. Through His creation, He has revealed Himself
so clearly that even the most benighted can understand the impotence of
man and the evidence that a higher Being has created the sun and the stars.
"For the invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are clearly
seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power
and Godhead; so that they are without excuse." Rom. 1:20.
   2. What special lessons concerning the knowledge and power
of the Creator may be obtained from meditation on the stars? Ps.
147:4, 5,
                                         [ 26 ]
   3. What illustration from His laws in nature does the Creator
employ to emphasize His own eternal constancy and dependability?
Jer. 31:35, 36; 33:20, 21, 25, 26.

   4. How futile are the efforts of man in comparison with the
movements of the stars? Is man capable of understanding, much
less controlling, the movements of the heavenly bodies? Job 38:
31-33, margin and A.R.V.

    5. What provision has the Creator made for the maintenance
of the activities of all the natural world? Ps. 119:90, 91; Isa. 40:26.

    NOTE.—For the more menial routine of the physical and biological affairs of
nature, God employs other objects of His creation and His laws of nature as
the mediate agents through which His plans are accomplished. For example,
"He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man:
that he may bring forth food out of the earth." Ps. 104:14. See also Ps.
119:90, 91.
    "God is constantly employed in upholding and using as His servants the
things that He has made. He works through the laws of nature, using them
as His instruments. . . . It is not by inherent power that year by year the
earth yields its bounties, and continues its march around the sun. The hand
of the Infinite One is perpetually at work guiding this planet."—The Ministry
of Healing, page 416.
    Thus the natural world operates in accordance with the laws which God
Himself has established so that He need not slavishly be present in person
to impel or guide each atom or star. This wonderful truth concerning an
infinite God was understood by the centurion of Capernaum, and Christ
commended his faith in it. Matt. 8:8-10; Luke 7:6-9. The power and agency
of God are channeled through the mediate "laws and properties of His instru-
ments," by which nature obeys her Creator. These laws and properties are
not inherent qualities, but rather are inseparable characteristics with which
nature was endowed at its creation.

                The Glory of the Stars
  6. How innumerable do the stars appear to be? Heb. 11:12;
Gen. 22:17.

   NoTE.—Each larger telescope constructed brings to view additional stars,
more remote and more faint than those observed previously. To the unaided
eye, about two thousand stars are visible at one time; a one-inch telescope
increases the number to more than 10,000, while the Mount Palomar 200-
inch instrument will reveal the images of some 1,500,000,000 stars.
   7. How is the difference in stars recognized in Scripture? 1 Cor.
15:41.
   8. How much of God's universe is visible to the human eye?
Job 26:13, first part; 14.
                                     [27]
                       The Greatness of the Creator
   9. Besides His omniscience in counting and directing the move-
ments of the myriads of stars, how is the omnipotence of the Creator
displayed? Suggest additional lessons taught by the stars. Isa. 40:
26, 28; Job 22:12.

   10. What ambition should actuate every true representative
of Christ? Dan. 12:3, A.R.V.; Rev. 2:26, 28.

    NOTE.—"As the stars tell us that there is a great light in heaven with whose
glory they are made bright, so Christians are to make it manifest that there
is a God on the throne of the universe whose character is worthy of praise
and imitation."—The Great Controversy, page 476.

                             Signs in the Heavens
  11. What sign announced to the Wise Men of the East the first
advent of Christ? Matt. 2:1, 2.

   12. What signs in the sun, moon, and stars truly portend Christ's
second advent? When did each of these occur? Matt. 24:29, 30;
Mark 13:24, 25; Luke 21:25; Rev. 6:12, 13.
    Nom—The darkening of the sun occurred May 19, 1780, and the darkness
of the following night was equally unnatural. The stars fell in unprecedented
showers November 13, 1833.


                    Lesson 10, for September 8, 1951
                        Creation: Animal Life
     MEMORY VERSE: "For every beast of the forest is Mine, and the cattle upon
a thousand hills. I know all the fowls of the Mountains: and the wild beasts of the
 field are Mine." Ps. 50:10, 11.                         .
     STUDY HELPS: R. E. Hoen, "'The Creator and His Workshop," chapter 10;
"Patriarchs and Prophets," page 443; Ps. 104:10-31.
     INTRODUCTION: In preparation of the earth as a home for the family of Adam,
the Creator completed the most perfect zoological garden. In advance, on the third
day, food had been provided for all of the animal creation. The earth was in readiness
for the various kinds of newly formed creatures to live in their respective environments.
However, the real marvel of the creation of animal life lay not in the mere diversity
and uniqueness of the various kinds, though that was wonder enough. Most marvelous
is the plan and omnipotence of the Creator by which portions of the earth, the very
elements of the dust, were so organized that the indefinable functions of life were dis-
played. Man can cause life to cease, but he can neither restore it in any dead organism
nor produce it in material which has not been living. Proponents of evolutionistic
philosophy glibly allude to a time when by a "fortuitous concourse of atoms," a simple
living organism appeared, yet they must admit freely and universally that living organ-
ism are not now being brought into existence spontaneously. This admission is an
                                        [ 28 ]
acknowledgment that the creation of living forms was a process distinctly different
from, and infinitely superior to, anything going on in nature at.present. It is impor-
tant to recognize that always, in all cases, life comes only from antecedent life, and
that the life of earthly organisms had its origin in the life of the Creator of the universe.

                      The First Animals
  1. What types of living creatures were formed on the fifth day?
Gen. 1:20-23.

   NoTE.---From the standpoint of their anatomy, there is a closer relation-
ship between the fishes and the birds than between these and the insects or
the mammals. In the margin of some editions and versions of the Bible, the
term "sea monsters" is used instead of "whales."
   2. What further additions to the animal kingdom were made
on the sixth day? Gen. 1:24, 25.

   3. How dependent are all living creatures upon God as the
source of their life? Ps. 104:25, 30, 29; Acts 17:24, 25.

    4. Of what were all the animals created? Gen. 2:19.

    NoTE.—Here again it is indicated clearly that the origin of matter at the
hand of the Creator "in the beginning," and the subsequent creation there-
froth of the various forms on the earth, both living and nonliving, were dis-
tinctly different and successive acts. Most of the creation week was devoted
to the second of these acts, the organization of the diverse forms which
beautified the earth and made it habitable. Both of these omnipotent creative
acts, origination and organization, are wholly beyond the power of any
created being; they are uniquely characteristic of the one and only true God
who "made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters."
Rev. 14:7.

                Life Only From Antecedent Life
    5. What false ideas concerning the origin of life were preva-
 lent during the Dark Ages, even persisting somewhat until the
 present time?
   ANSWER: The theory of spontaneous generation of life. It was formerly
 commonly and erroneously believed that moist earth brought forth insects,
                                            [ 29 ]
that decayed flesh bred flies, that horsehairs produced worms, and that weeds
simply grew of themselves.
   6. What modern erroneous philosophy has arisen concerning
the origin of animal life?
    ANSWER: A chemico-mechanistic theory of the origin of life. This theory
presumes that in the remote past, in a supposedly favorable environment of
warmth and moisture, certain of the elements of the earth united to form
particles having a composition similar to that of the materials found in very
simple living cells. Groups of such particles were presumed to have begun
to manifest the behavior of minute living organisms. From such a beginning,
evolutionistic philosophy has invented the theory of the development of the
diverse and more elaborate forms of animal life.
    Three fundamental errors in such doctrine may be refuted by the results
of scientific study. First, no instance of the formation of any of the essentially
vital constituents of living cells has ever been observed under conditions which
preclude the directive influence of living organisms or of the products of
life functions. Second, no instance has ever been reported or observed of
the assumption of the distinctive life functions (nutrition, respiration, repro-
duction, irritability, responsive motion) by any mass of matter, either syn-
thetic or natural in origin, except under the immediate influence of a living
organism. And whenever such influence results in a living organism, the new
organism is the direct progeny of, and of the same general kind as, its ancestor.
Third, no demonstrated changes have ever produced animals having char-
acteristics distinctly different from, or superior to, those resident in their
ancestors. Variations, even new species, and a host of degenerate forms have
resulted from many conditions, but no definitely new "kinds" have been pro-
duced since "the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of
them." Gen. 2:1. Compare Ex. 20:11; Heb. 4:3, last part.
   7. What is the Scriptural and true scientific teaching concerning
the origin of the present animal life of the earth? Job 12:7-10.

    NorE.—The entire animate creation of the earth teaches in most emphatic
terms "that the hand of the Lord hath wrought" the creation of all living
forms. Life comes only from antecedent life (see Lesson 6), and in God only
is the life whence came all other life. Science has no other answer. According
to the plan of the Creator, new individual animals were to arise as descendants
of the created forms. It is refreshing that many able scholars and students
of biology, beginning with Pasteur and Mendel, have acknowledged that there
is no other source of life than antecedent life.
                 Provision for the Needs of Animals
   8. Upon whom do the animals depend for their daily food and
protection? Matt. 6:26; Ps. 104:10-12, 14, 16-18, 27, 28; 147:9;
Luke 12:24.

   NOTE.—"He `maketh grass to grow upon the mountains,' and by Him the
valleys are made fruitful. All the beasts of the forest seek their meat from
God, and every living creature, from the smallest insect up to man, is daily
dependent upon His providential care."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 115.
                                    [ 30]
   9. What provision was made in advance for the nourishment
of animal life? With what kind of diet were the animals originally
provided? Gen. 1:11, 12, 30.

                   The Relation of Animals to Man
   10. What service to man were animals to perform? Prov. 14:4.

   11. What was to be the relation of the animals to man? Gen.
1:26, 28; Ps. 8:6-8.

    NOTE.—"While they remained true to God, Adam and his companion were
to bear rule over the earth. Unlimited control was given them over every
living thing."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 50. Compare The Story of
Redemption, page 22.
   12. As a representative of His Father, how did Jesus relate Him-
self to the animal creation? Luke 12:6.

    NoTE.—"Jesus was the fountain of healing mercy for the world; and
through all those secluded years at Nazareth, His life flowed out in currents
of sympathy and tenderness. The aged, the sorrowing, and the sin-burdened,
the children at play in their innocent joy, the little creatures of the groves,
the patient beasts of burden,—all were happier for His presence. He whose
word of power upheld the worlds would stoop to relieve a wounded bird.
There was nothing beneath His notice, nothing to which He disdained to
minister."—The Desire of Ages, page 74.
   13. How should animals be treated? Prov. 12:10.

   NOTE.—"Few realize as they should the sinfulness of abusing animals or
leaving them to suffer from neglect. He who created man made the lower
animals also, and 'His tender mercies are over all His works.' The animals
were created to serve man, but he has no right to cause them pain by harsh
treatment or cruel exaction. . . . He who will abuse animals because he has
them in his power, is both a coward aand a tyrant. . . . A record goes up
to heaven, and a day is coming when judgment will be pronounced against
those who abuse God's creatures."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 443.

           Acquaintance With Animal Behavior
  1. How well was Adam acquainted with the animal creation?
Gen. 2:19.
  2. How familiar with nature was Solomon? How widespread
was the interest in learning of his wisdom? 1 Kings 4:33, 34.

   3. Why are many animals now so fearful and ferocious? Gen.
3:14, 15; 9:2, 5.
   4. How gentle were the animals in Eden? What dispositions
will they possess when restored in the new earth? Isa. 11:6-9; 65:25,

   NorE.—"The lion and the lamb sported peacefully around them, or lay
down together at their feet. The happy birds flitted about them without fear;
and as their glad songs ascended to the praise of their Creator, Adam and
Eve united with them in thanksgiving to the Father and the Son."—Patri-
archs and Prophets, page 50.
                  Lessons of Everyday Life
   5. What animal teaches that it is wise to provide for present
and future needs? Prov. 6:6-8; 30:25.

    NOTE.—"The habitations that the ants build for themselves show skill and
perseverance. Only one little grain at a time can they handle, but by diligence
and perseverance they accomplish wonders. Solomon points to the industry
of the ant as a reproach to those who waste their hours in idleness or in
practices that corrupt soul and body. The ant prepares for future seasons;
but many gifted with reasoning powers fail to prepare for the future im-
mortal life."—Counsels to Teachers, page 190.
   6. What other small creatures are examples of diligence and
industry? Prov. 30:26-28.
                                       [ 32 ]
   7. What beasts typify strength and cruelty? John 10:12; 1 Sam.
17:37; Dan. 7:4, 5.

  8. How well do animals learn to know their caretakers? Are
men always as considerate as are the animals? Isa. 1:2, 3.

   9. What creatures exemplify peace and harmlessness? Matt.
10:16.
                       Spiritual Lessons
   10. Why was Jesus likened to a lamb? Isa. 53:7; John 1:36; Rev.
13:8.

  11. In what ways may the animals teach man to trust in God?
Matt. 6:25, 26; Ps. 104:27, 28.

   12. How are the wisdom and omnipotence of the Creator dis-
played in the instincts of animals? How do these wonders of nature
direct toward humility and faith in God? Job 39:1-12, 26, 27..

    NoTE.—God bestowed upon every member of the animal creation instincts
—wholly unlearned hereditary behavior patterns—which enable the creature
to survive and to fill its unique niche in the economy of nature. Many crea-
tures, particularly the insects, have no 'opportunity to learn by observing the
behavior of their parents, yet each of them functions as efficiently as did its
parents. Each kind of bird builds a distinctive nest and has a song all its
own; each insect selects specific foods and habitats; cattle and horses have
characteristically different methods of arising and lying down. Thus the
whole untutored world has been provided for by an all-wise Creator.
   13. What was the result of such scientific reasoning upon Job?
Job 40:1-5; 42:1-6.

    INTRODUCTION: "So God created man in His own image; . . . male and
female created He them." Here is clearly set forth the origin of the human race; and
the divine record is so plainly stated that there is no occasion for erroneous conclusions.
                                            I 33 ]
God created man in His own image. Here is no mystery. There is no ground for the
supposition that man was evolved, by slow degrees of development, from the lower
forms of animal or vegetable life.. . . Men are so intent upon excluding God from the
sovereignty of the universe, that they degrade man, and defraud him of the dignity of
his origin. He who . . filled the earth and the heavens with the wonders of His
power, when He came to crown His glorious work, to place one in the midst to stand
as ruler of the fair earth, did not fail to create a being worthy of the hand that gave
him life. The genealogy of our race, as given by inspiration, traces back its origin,
not to a line of developing germs, mollusks, and quadrupeds, but to the great Creator.
Though formed from the dust, Adam was 'the Son of God.' "—"Patriarchs and Proph-
ets," pages 44, 45.

                     The Crowning Act of Creation
   1. What ultimate plan did God have for the earth? Isa. 45:18.

   2. What was the crowning creative act of the sixth day? Gen.
1:26, 27.

   3. For what purpose was man created? Eph. 2:10; Ps. 8:6; Isa.
43:7, 21.

   NOTE.—"In the creation it was His purpose that the earth should be in-
habited by beings whose existence would be a blessing to themselves and to
one another, and an honor to their Creator. All who will may identify them-
selves with this purpose. Of them it is spoken, 'This people have I formed
for Myself; they shall show forth My praise.' "—Prophets and Kings, page
500. See also Education, pages 14, 15.
    4. By whom was man created? Gen. 1:26, 27; Isa. 45:11, 12.

    NoTE.—"In the creation of man was manifest the agency of a personal
God. When God had made man in His image, the human form was perfect
in all its arrangements, but it was without life. Then a personal, self-existing
God breathed into that form the breath of life, and man became a living,
intelligent being. All parts of the human organism were set in action. The
heart, the arteries, the veins, the tongue, the hands, the feet, the senses, the
faculties of the mind, all began their work, and all were placed under law.
Man became a living soul. Through Christ the Word, a personal God created
man, and endowed him with intelligence and power."—The Ministry of Heal-
ing, page 415. See also Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 264.
   5. What part did man himself have in his creation? Ps. 100:3;
Isa. 45:9.

                          Characteristics of Man
   6. Of what was man formed? In what way does man differ
from other living creatures? Gen. 2:7; Job 32:8.

    NOTE.—"Children have an intelligent will, which should be directed to
control all their powers. Dumb animals need to be trained; for they have
not reason and intellect. But the human mind must be taught self-control.
It must be educated to rule the human being, while animals are controlled by
a master, and are trained to be submissive to him."—Testimonies, vol. 3,
p. 132; Counsels to Teachers, page 73.
   7. With what unique characteristic was man endowed? Gen.
1:26, 27.

   NOTE.—It is not presumed that an image or likeness is identical with, or
even similar in all respects to, the original, for it falls far short of its pattern
both in quality and number of characteristics.
   "Man was to bear God's image, both in outward resemblance and in
character. Christ alone is 'the express image' of the Father; but man was
formed in the likeness of God. His nature was in harmony with the will of
God. His mind was capable of comprehending divine things. His affections
were pure; his appetites and passions were under the control of reason. He
was holy and happy in bearing the image of God, and in perfect obedience
to His. will."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 45.
   "When Adam came from the Creator's hand, he bore, in his physical,
mental, and spiritual nature, a likeness to his Maker. 'God created man in
His own image,' and it was His purpose that the longer man lived, the more
fully he should reveal this image,—the more fully reflect the glory of the
Creator."—Education, page 15. We are "foreordained to be conformed to the
image of His Son." Rom. 8:29, A.R.V.
   8. What erroneous modern teachings have arisen concerning
the image of God in man? Rom. 1:21-23, 25.

    Num.—The Scriptures portray and idealize Godlikeness in man, not man-
likeness in God. Evolutionistic biology envisions man as the product of his
own, or of his ancestors' creative efforts, and thus denies a divine Creator.

           Plans for Social and Physical Needs of Man
  9. What provision was made for companionship for Adam?
From what material was Eve formed? Gen. 2:18, 21, 22.

   Nom.—The significance of the word "meet" is frequently lost or mis-
understood by reason of the popular expression, "helpmeet," which does not
occur in the Scripture. Webster defines meet as "suitable, fit, proper, appro-
priate, qualified," and one of the marginal renderings of Genesis 2:18 is an-
swering to," that is, corresponding to, Adam. "God Himself gave Adam a
companion. He provided 'an help meet for him,'—a helper corresponding to
him,—one who was fitted to be his companion, and who could be one with
                                    f35 1
him in love and sympathy. Eve was created from a rib taken from the side
of Adam, signifying that she was not to control him as the head, nor to be
trampled under his feet as an inferior, but to stand by his side as an equal,
to be loved and protected by him. A part of man, bone of his bone, and
flesh of his flesh, she was his second self; showing the close union and the
affectionate attachment that should exist in this relation."—Patriarchs and
Prophets, page 46.
  10. What relationship did the Creator intend should exist be-
tween man and wife? What was Adam's reaction to the gift of a
companion? Gen. 2:23, 24.

   11. Why did Adam name his wife Eve? What was the Creator's
plan for populating the earth? Gen. 3:20; 1:28.

  12. How perfect were the first pair at the close of creation
week? Gen. 1:31; Eccl. 7:29.

                   Relation of Man to His Creator
   13. By reason of creation, what relation does God recognize as
existing between Himself and man? Mal. 2:10; Luke 3:38; Deut.
32:6.

   NOTE.—Some Oxford editions of the Authorized Version give in the margin
at Deuteronomy 32:6 the alternative reading, "produced" for "bought."
   14. How dependent is man upon his Creator for the continuance
of his existence? To what extent was man endowed with immor-
tality? Acts 17:28; Gen. 2:17; 3:22, last part.

    NoTE.—The popular doctrine of the immortality of the soul of man
implies that the Creator Himself has not the power to remove that which
He has bestowed. Such teaching is a denial of the power of the God that
created- man a living soul. The immortality bestowed upon man was condi-
tional upon perfect obedience. Compare 1 Tim. 6:15, 16.

    INTRODUCTION: "The Creator chose for our first parents the surroundings
                                      [ 36
best adapted for their health and happiness. He did not place them in a palace, or
surround them with the artificial adornments and luxuries that so many today are
struggling to obtain. He placed them in close touch with nature, and in close com-
munion with the holy ones of heaven. . . . Adam and Eve, in their untainted purity,
delighted in the sights and sounds of Eden. God appointed them their work in the
garden, `to dress it and to keep it.' Each day's labor brought them health and glad-
ness, and the happy pair greeted with joy the visits of their Creator, as in the cool
of the day He walked and talked with them.... The plan of life which God appointed
for our first parents has lessons for us. Although sin has cast its shadow over the
earth, God desires His children to find delight in the works of His hands."—"The Min-

                                      7. Review the entire lesson.

                         A Perfect Garden Home
    1. What special provision was made for a homesite for Adam
and Eve? In what sort of house did they dwell? With what was
it adorned? Gen. 2:8, 15.

    NoTE.—"The home of our first parents was to be a pattern for other homes
as their children should go forth to occupy the earth. That home, beautified
by the hand of God Himself, was not a gorgeous palace. . . . God placed
Adam in a garden. This was his dwelling. The blue heavens were its dome;
the earth, with its delicate flowers and carpet of living green, was its floor;
and the leafy branches of the goodly trees were its canopy. Its walls were
hung with the most magnificent adornings,—the handiwork of the great
Master Artist."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 49.
   2. With what were our first parents clothed while in their
innocence in Eden? Gen. 2:25; 3:11.

   NOTE.—"The robe of light which had enshrouded them, now disappeared,
and to supply its place they endeavored to fashion for themselves a cover-
ing."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 57.

                       The Original Plan of Living
   3. From what source did God plan that man's, food should be
obtained? Why were plants created before the animals were made?
Gen. 1:29; 2:9.
   NcrrE.—"Grains, fruits, nuts, and vegetables constitute the diet chosen for
us by our Creator." "The diet appointed man in the beginning did not include
animal food."—The Ministry of Healing, pages 296, 311.
  4. Through what means did God provide for the day-by-day
needs of mankind? Ps. 104:14, 15.
                                        [ 37
    NOTE.—God could have supplied all the food and garments and shelter
ready-made, but His plan enabled man to be His partner in producing these
from the natural world. Through tilling the soil, planting and reaping, man
is enabled to co-operate in the marvelous plan of life and growth by which
the needs of human life are largely supplied.
   S. In what way must man unite his efforts with those of the
Creator in the maintenance of life? How universal is the duty of
labor? Gen. 2:15; 2 Thess. 3:10.

    NoTE.—"To the dwellers in Eden was committed the care of the garden,
`to dress it and to keep it.' . .. God appointed labor as a blessing to man, to
occupy his mind, to strengthen his body, and to develop his faculties. In
mental and physical activity, Adam found one of the highest pleasures of
his holy existence."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 50.

                   Man's Physical Activities
    6. According to the psalmist's account of creation, how were
at least some of man's days to be occupied? Ps. 104:23.

   7. What physical benefits derive from labor? Eccl. 5:12.

   8. What importance did Solomon place upon agriculture?
Prov. 12:11; 28:19.
                Mental and Spiritual Provisions
   9. For what purposes other than for food were the plants and
trees of the garden designed? Gen. 2:9; Ps. 104:16, 17.
   NorE.—"In the garden that God prepared as a home for His children,
graceful shrubs and delicate flowers greeted the eye at every turn. There
were trees of every variety, many of them laden with fragrant and delicious
fruit. On their branches the birds caroled their songs of praise. Under their
shadow the creatures of earth sported together without a fear. Adam and
Eve, in their untainted purity, delighted in the sights and sounds of Eden."—
The Ministry of Healing, page 261.
   10. What other provisions were made for the enjoyment of
Adam and Eve, and for the maintenance of the realm over which
they were to have dominion? Ps. 104:10-13, 18, 19; Gen. 2:10-14.

   11. How fully did the dwellers in Eden become acquainted with
the animals, plants, and other objects of the natural world? Gen.
1:28; 2:19.

   NOTE.—"With every living creature, from the mighty leviathan that play-
eth among the waters, to the insect mote that floats in the sunbeam, Adam
                                    [ 38 ]
was familiar . . . They [our first parents] were ever discovering some attrac-
tion that filled their hearts with deeper love, and called forth fresh expres-
sions of gratitude."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 51.
12. Since Eden was the prototype of the restored earth, what
Worship facilities must have been available to Adam? Rev. 21:22.

  NOTE.—"The groves were God's first temples."—W. C. Bryant, "A Forest
Hymn."
   13. In Eden, how did God transmit instruction to our first par-
ents for their physical and spiritual welfare? Gen. 2:16, 17; 1:28-
30; 3:8.
   NOTE.—God communicated directly and personally with man and con-
veyed to him by word of mouth His messages of counsel and instruction.

       THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
               September 29, 1951 — China Division
    The overflow of the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering that will be given on
September 29 has been dedicated to the China Division, and our national
leaders of the work in China have decided that the funds that come to them
from this overflow shall be used to strengthen the work among the tribes-
people in the borderlands of China. In the past the work has gone slowly
among the Mongolians, the Tibetans, and the tribespeople, but now these
people, too, are awakening and calling for the gospel. The work can never
be finished in all the world until it has been preached to these peoples. If the
situation is such that the money cannot be sent into China at the end of this
year, it will be held in trust for the China Division until such time as money
can be sent in. Study the map on the back of this Quarterly.
