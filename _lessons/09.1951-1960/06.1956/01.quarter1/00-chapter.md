   3. What is said of the stars, the
sun, and the moon? Isa. 13:10. See                     NoTE.-God's charge against the people
also Matt. 24:29.                                   is that "they have transgressed the laws,

changed the ordinance, broken the everlast-
ing covenant." This charge is true today.

regarded, crime and violence are alarmingly
increasing, and the everlasting covenant is
broken.
   6. What is the result of this destruc-
tion? Isa. 24:7-12.



  NOTE.—God will speak in ways that can-
not be misunderstood. When the earth shall                                                  III

destruction reigns, there will be sorrow and
anguish. How significant is the expression,

                                                   24:17, 18.
               The Remnant
  7. What will be the experience of
the remnant? Isa. 24:13, 14.                         NoTE.—Fear and panic shall seize the
                                                   wicked. As they flee, some will be caught in

                  ATTENTION, SABBATH SCHOOL TEACHERS!
         Are you using the Teacher's Edition of the "Sabbath School
     Lesson Quarterly"? If not, you should ask your Sabbath-school
     secretary to secure it for you. You will find it a great help in the
     preparation of your lesson as well as in teaching, for every other
     page in the quarterly is blank, thus giving space on which to
     write out answers to questions, notes, or special comments to use
     in class. It has been provided in response to requests from many
     teachers. It is designed to help you, but it cannot help you if you
     do not use it. Try it!

   It is not possible in one quarter's lessons to do justice to the wealth of material found in
the book of Isaiah. Therefore we will continue the study during next quarter, and even
then it will be necessary to omit or greatly abbreviate certain portions of the book.

                     THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING

                                    March 31, 1956
   The overflow of the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering on March 31 goes to the
Australasian Division to help to establish a medical unit in the New Hebrides
at Aore and to help in enlarging the Coral Sea Union Training School at
Kabiufa, New Guinea. The work in these heathen South Pacific Islands has
gone slowly during the years, but now within the last few years there is a
much greater turning to the light.
   Now is our time of opportunity to come to the aid of these poor people.
Through the medical ministry, doors are opened for the gospel ministry, and
through our training schools young people are trained to work for their own
people. This is the only way the work can be finished in these islands, for the
foreign missionaries can never do it alone. Won't you pray and give for the
advancement of the work in these needy fields at this time?
