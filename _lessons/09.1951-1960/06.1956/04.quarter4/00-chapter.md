         THE BLESSING OF DAILY STUDY
   "With joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation." Isa. 12:3.
   "Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and Thy word was unto me
the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by Thy name, 0 Lord
God of hosts." Jer. 15:16.
   "As a means of intellectual training, the opportunities of the Sabbath are
invaluable. Let the Sabbath-school lesson be learned, not by a hasty glance at
the lesson scripture on Sabbath morning, but by careful study for the next
week on Sabbath afternoon, with daily review or illustration during the week.
Thus the lesson will become fixed in the memory, a treasure never to be
wholly lost."—Education, pages 251, 252.
   "Every day some portion of time should be appropriated to the study of
the lessons, not merely in learning to mechanically repeat the words, while
the mind does not comprehend the meaning; but to go to the very founda-
tion, and become familiar with what is brought out in the lesson."—Counsels
on Sabbath School Work, page 53.

                My Daily Lesson Study Pledge
   As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge of the Scriptures, I
pledge myself to the careful and prayerful study of some portion of my Sab-
bath-school lesson each day of the week.

follow his Lord to prison and to death, he
meant it, every word of it; but he did not
know himself. Hidden in His heart were
elements of evil that circumstances would
fan into life. Unless he was made conscious
of his danger, these would prove his eternal
ruin. The Saviour saw in him a self-love
and assurance that would overbear even
his love for Christ. . . . Christ's solemn
warning was a call to heart searching."—

that He could have given. Herod had re-
jected the truth spoken to him by the
greatest of the prophets, and no other mes-
sage was he to receive. Not a word had the
Majesty of heaven for him. That ear that
had ever been open to human woe, had no
room for Herod's commands. Those eyes
that had ever rested upon the penitent sin-
ner in pitying, forgiving love had no look
to bestow upon Herod. Those lips that had
uttered the most impressive truth, that in
tones of tenderest entreaty had pleaded
with the most sinful and the most degraded,
were closed to the haughty king who felt
no need of a Saviour."—The Desire of

  NOTE.—"In teaching these disciples, Je-
sus showed the importance of the Old Tes-
tament as a witness to His mission. Many
professed Christians now discard the Old
Testament, claiming that it is no longer of
any use. But such is not Christ's teaching.
So highly did He value it that at one time
He said, 'If they hear not Moses and the
prophets, neither will they be persuaded,
though one rose from the dead.' . . .
  "It is the light from the prophetic past
that brings out the life of Christ and the
teachings of the New Testament with clear-
ness and beauty. The miracles of Christ

found in comparing the prophecies of the

      Again we have the opportunity of sending aid to the great Southern
   African Division, and this time it is for the worthy cause of providing
   homes for African workers. Many of our African young people are go-
   ing out as "foreign missionaries" to other tribes. In order to enable
   these workers to do the most effective work and to make their homes
   models of Christian homes in the communities where they labor, we
   need to provide them with modest but substantial houses in which to
   live. That is the call that comes to us from Africa this quarter. Will
   you help answer the call?
