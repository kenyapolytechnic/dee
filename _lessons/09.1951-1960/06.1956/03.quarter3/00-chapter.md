        THE BLESSING OF DAILY STUDY
   "With joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation." Isa. 12:3.
   "Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and Thy word was unto me
the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by Thy name, 0 Lord
God of hosts." Jer. 15:16.
   "As a means of intellectual training, the opportunities of the Sabbath are
invaluable. Let the Sabbath-school lesson be learned, not by a hasty glance at •
the lesson scripture on .Sabbath morning, but by careful study for the next
week on Sabbath afternoon, with daily review or illustration during the week.
Thus the lesson will become fixed in the memory, a treasure never to be
wholly lost."—Education, pages 251, 252.
   "Every day some portion of time should be appropriated to the study of
the lessons, not merely in learning to mechanically repeat the words, while
the mind does not comprehend the meaning; but to go to the very founda-
tion, and become familiar with what is brought out in the lesson."—Counsels
on Sabbath Sc-hool Work, page 53.

                My Daily Lesson Study Pledge
   As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge of the Scriptures, I
pledge myself to the careful and prayerful study of some portion of my Sab-
bath-school lesson each day of the week.

casions was a yearling lamb for a burnt
offering, and a young pigeon or a turtledove
for a sin offering; but with that beautiful
tenderness which is so marked a character-
istic of the Mosaic legislation, those who
were too poor for so comparatively costly
an offering, were allowed to bring instead
two turtledoves or two young pigeons.                                                   411

                        THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
                                 September 29, 1956

       The overflow of the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering on September 29
   goes to the Inter-American Division to help build (t) a modest hospital
   at Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, (2) a library and theological workshop area
   for the Antillian Junior College, (3) dormitories for the Navajoa
   (Mexico) school. Our work is progressing more rapidly in the Inter-
   American Division than in almost any other part of the world field.
   This very fact lays a greater responsibility upon those in the homelands
   to provide the necessary equipment to make the work of the laborers in
   that great field more effective.
