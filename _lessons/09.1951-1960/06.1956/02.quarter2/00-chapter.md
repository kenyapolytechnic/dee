R     o. 244, SECOND QUARTER, 1956
         THE BLESSING OF DAILY STUDY
   "With joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation." Isa. 12:3.
   "Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and Thy word was unto me
the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by Thy name, 0 Lord
God of hosts." Jer. 15:16.
   "As a means of intellectual training, the opportunities of the Sabbath are
invaluable. Let the Sabbath-school lesson be learned, not by a hasty glance at
the lesson scripture on Sabbath morning, but by careful study for the next
week on Sabbath afternoon, with daily review or illustration during the week.
Thus the lesson will become fixed in the memory, a treasure never to be
wholly lost."—Education, pages 251, 252.
   "Every day some portion of time should be appropriated to the study of
the lessons, not merely in learning to mechanically repeat the words, while
the mind does not comprehend the meaning; but to go to the very founda-
tion, and become familiar with what is brought out in the lesson."—Counsels
on Sabbath School Work, page 53.

                My Daily Lesson Study Pledge
   As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge of the Scriptures, I
pledge myself to the careful and prayerful study of some portion of my Sab-
bath-school lesson each day of the week.

   pleasure on My holy day; and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the
   Lord, honorable; and shalt honor Him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding
   thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words: then -shalt thou delight
   thyself in the Lord; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the
   earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of
   the Lord hath spoken it." Isa. 58:13, 14.

  The Ishmaelites to whom Joseph was
sold were Midianites. Gen. 37:25, 36. The

those who are downcast and disheart-
ened, for those who "mourn in Zion." This
mourning is the same as the sighing men-
tioned in Ezek. 9:4. It is mourning for
sin, not necessarily the sins of others, but
their own. Read The Desire of Ages, page
300.
  "Trees of righteousness," literally "oaks"
or "terebinths." The Revised Standard
Version gives "oaks of righteousness." The
same figure is used in Jer. 17:8.
  "That He might be glorified." God is to
be glorified in His saints. He wants to re-
veal His character in us. His meekness,
His humility, His self-control and purity,
should be our standard of conduct.

                    THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING

                                June 30, 1956

                          South American Division

    One of the great mission fields of the South American Division is to
receive the overflow of the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering this quarter.
Brazil is a country larger than the United States and is divided into
twenty states, and these states are organized into three union missions.
It is the East Brazil Union that is looking to us for help this quarter. We
have the privilege of helping to enlarge the facilities of the Northeast
Brazil Academy in order that more young people may have the privi-
lege of a Christian education. There are so many young people attend-
ing this school at the present time that they are far too crowded and
must have more room.
    Besides helping the academy, we can also help to build four new
church buildings in the East Brazil Union. Many people are uniting
with the church in this great mission field, but in many places we have
no church buildings where they can attend church, or else the churches
are far too small. Surely everyone will want to have a part in helping
the good work along in a field where the membership is steadily
increasing.
