         THE BLESSING OF DAILY STUDY
   "With joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation." Isa. 12:3.
   "Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and Thy word was unto me
the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by Thy name, 0 Lord
God of hosts." Jer. 15:16.
   "As a means of intellectual training, the opportunities of the Sabbath are
invaluable. Let the Sabbath-school lesson be learned, not by a hasty glance at
the lesson scripture on Sabbath morning, but by careful study for the next
week on Sabbath afternoon, with daily review or illustration during the week.
Thus the lesson will become fixed in the memory, a treasure never to be
wholly lost."—Education, pages 251, 252.
   "Every day some portion of time should be appropriated to the study of
the lessons, not merely in learning to mechanically repeat the words, while
the mind does not comprehend the meaning; but to go to the very founda-
tion, and become familiar with what is brought out in the lesson."—Counsels
on Sabbath School Work, page 53.


                My Daily Lesson Study Pledge
   As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge of the Scriptures, I
pledge myself to the careful and prayerful study of some portion of my Sab-
bath-school lesson each day of the week.

         The Prophet's Strength                   2. How did Elijah demonstrate
             and Weakness                       that he was "not above the frailties of

come times of keen disappointment and
utter discouragement,—days when sorrow
is the portion, and it is hard to believe that
God is still the kind benefactor of His
earthborn children; days when troubles
harass the soul, till death seems preferable
to life. . . . Could we at such times discern
with spiritual insight the meaning of God's
providences, we should see angels seeking to
save us from ourselves, striving to plant
our feet upon a foundation more firm than
the everlasting hills; and new faith, new
life, would spring into being."—Prophets

                              December 28, 1957

    The Northern European Division is a home base from which, many
missionaries have been sent out to many mission fields throughout the
world. This division has certain mission fields assigned to it as its par-
ticular responsibility. And this quarter the overflow of the Thirteenth
Sabbath Offering is to go to the Northern European Division to help in
the work in some of its mission fields.
    Only in the last few years has there been even a beginning of our
work in Greenland, and it is now our privilege to help build the first
Seventh-day Adventist chapel in that land of ice and snow. Surely it
will be a thrill to have a part in this new work. Then in the mission
fields of the great continent of Africa, we are going to help build a mis-
sion headquarters in Monrovia, Liberia, and a mission station and clinic
in southern Ethiopia.
    Let us do our very best to strengthen the hands of the Northern
European Division by helping to provide these urgently needed facilities
through a liberal Thirteenth Sabbath Offering.
