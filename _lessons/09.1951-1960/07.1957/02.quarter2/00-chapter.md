         THE BLESSING OF DAILY STUDY
   "With joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation." Isa. 12:3.
   "Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and Thy word was unto me
the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by Thy name, 0 Lord
God of hosts." Jer. 15:16.
   "As a means of intellectual training, the opportunities of the Sabbath are
invaluable. Let the Sabbath-school lesson be learned, not by a hasty glance at
the lesson scripture on Sabbath morning, but by careful study for the next
week on Sabbath afternoon, with daily review or illustration during the week.
Thus the lesson will become fixed in the memory, a treasure never to be
wholly lost."—Education, pages 251, 252.
   "Every day some portion of time should be appropriated to the study of
the lessons, not merely in learning to mechanically repeat the words, while
the mind does not comprehend the meaning; but to go to the very founda-
tion, and become familiar with what is brought out in the lesson."—Counsels
on Sabbath School Work, page 53.


                My Daily Lesson Study Pledge
   As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge of the Scriptures, I
pledge myself to the careful and prayerful study of some portion of my Sab-
bath-school lesson each day of the week.

was symbolical of Christ, it had no value
apart from Him. When the Jews sealed
their rejection of Christ by delivering Him
to death, they rejected all that gave sig-
nificance to the temple and its services. Its
sacredness had departed. It was doomed to
destruction. From that day sacrificial offer-

                                                through Moses. If they had listened to the

  NOTE.--"There was great grief and con-
sternation at the death of James. When
Peter was also imprisoned, the entire church
engaged in fasting and prayer. While the
Jews were celebrating the memorial of
their deliverance from Egypt, and pretend-
ing great zeal for the law, they were at the
same time persecuting and murdering the
believers in Christ, thus transgressing every
principle of that law. At these great reli-
gious gatherings they stirred one another
up against the Christians, till they were
united in a bitter hatred of them."—The          PETER IS RELEASED. JAMES IS EXECUTED.

                        THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING

                       June 29, 1957, Far Eastern Division

   The third quarter of 1955 . the Sabbath schools around the world gave a
liberal Thirteenth Sabbath Offering which provided an overflow that helped
to erect the new administration building at the Philippine Union College and
also aided our school in West New Guinea. Our believers in the Far Eastern
Division greatly appreciated this liberal help.
    This quarter again we have the privilege of helping the educational work
in the Philippine Islands, where the work is growing so rapidly that our
school plants are continually taxed to capacity to care for the large number of
young people seeking a Christian education.
    This time we are helping to establish two new academies, one at Naga in
the North Philippine Union and one at Mindanao in the Southern Philippine,
Union. These schools are entirely new projects and will require a great deal
of money to complete. May we bespeak on their behalf a liberal Thirteenth
Sabbath Offering on the part of our Sabbath-school members everywhere.
    Another worthy project to benefit from the overflow this quarter is an
evangelistic center and medical clinic combined in the city of Osaka, Japan.
Let us show our interest in finishing the work by giving a bountiful offering
on June 29.
