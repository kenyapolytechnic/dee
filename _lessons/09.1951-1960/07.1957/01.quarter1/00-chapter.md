           THE BLESSING OF DAILY STUDY
   "With joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation." Isa. 12:3.
   "Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and Thy word was unto me
the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by Thy name, 0 Lord
God of hosts." Jer. 15:16.
   "As a means of intellectual training, the opportunities of the Sabbath are
invaluable. Let the Sabbath-school lesson be learned, not by a hasty glance at
the lesson scripture on Sabbath morning, but by careful study for the next
week on Sabbath afternoon, with daily review or illustration during the week.
Thus the lesson will become fixed in the memory, a treasure never to be
wholly lost."—Education, pages 251, 252.
   "Every day some portion of time should be appropriated to the study of
the lessons, not merely in learning to mechanically repeat the words, while
the mind does not comprehend the meaning; but to go to the very founda-
tion, and become familiar with what is brought out in the lesson."—Counsels
on Sabbath School Work, page 53.


                   My Daily Lesson Study Pledge
   As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge of the Scriptures, I
pledge myself to the careful and prayerful study of some portion of my Sab-
bath-school lesson each day of the week.

                  ATTENTION, SABBATH SCHOOL TEACHERS!
         Are you using the Teacher's Edition of the "Sabbath School
       Lesson Quarterly"? If not, you should ask your Sabbath-school
       secretary to secure it for you. You will find it a great help in the
       preparation of your lesson as well as in teaching, for every other
       page in the quarterly is blank, thus giving space on which to
       write out answers to questions, notes, or special comments to use
       in class. It has been provided in response to requests from many
       teachers. It is designed to help you, but it cannot help you if you
       do not use it. Try it!

                THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING

                            March 30, 1957

    The Thirteenth Sabbath Offering overflow for the first quarter of
1957 will help to provide both a boys' and a girls' dormitory for the
Nile Union Academy, located near Cairo, Egypt, and to erect a class-
room building, one dormitory, and some faculty homes for the Iran
Training Institute just outside the walls of Teheran, Iran.
    Our workers of the Middle East write as follows :
    "One of the greatest needs is for a strong educational program in
Iran to save our youth and to prepare them to take up the responsibili-
ties God would have them carry."
    "At the present time at our Nile Union Academy we can accept only
boys, as there are no dormitories for either boys or girls. The boys sleep
in double-decker beds in the classrooms of our only building—the
administration building. There are from twelve to eighteen students
sleeping in a room."
    "Living on the crossroads of the nations, with events changing so
rapidly, we are conscious of the fact that time is running out. As you
give, remember you are helping to save the youth in these lands of the
Bible."
