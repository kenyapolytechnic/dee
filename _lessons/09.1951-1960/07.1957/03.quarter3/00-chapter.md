there were no bishops in the modern sense

PURPOSE OF THE LESSON: To see how the church, through the deliberations of a

responded to the call for help, another ac-
cusation was added,—`and further brought

   "By the Jewish law, it was a crime pun-
ishable with death for an uncircumcised
person to enter the inner courts of the
sacred edifice. Paul had been seen in the
city in company with Trophimus, an Ephe-
sian, and it was conjectured that he had
brought him into the temple. This he had
not done; and being himself a Jew, his act
in entering the temple was no violation of
the law. But though the charge was wholly
false, it served to arouse the popular preju-

(Rom. 1:9-12) was now gratified, and he
took courage on meeting the brethren. Read

                         THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING

                                  September 28, 1957

   The overflow of the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering on September 28 goes to
the Southern Asia Division to help in building a new medical center in New
Delhi and in rebuilding the East Pakistan Training School. For a long time
our people in Southern Asia have felt the need of a medical center in the
capital city of New Delhi. It is planned to build a modest but modern well-
equipped hospital of about sixty beds.
   The training school at Jalipar has served a great need for our Bengal-speak-
ing youth, but the school buildings are badly in need of repair, and they need
to be raised above flood level, so that every year the students won't have to
move to the top floor when the rains come.
   Let us give a good offering for India this quarter.
