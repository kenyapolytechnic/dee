SENIOR DIVISION, No.   SECOND. QUARTER, 1959
         THE BLESSING OF DAILY STUDY
   "He who by faith receives the word is receiving the very life and character
of God. Every seed brings forth fruit after its kind.... Receive into the soul
by faith the incorruptible seed of the word, and it will bring forth a character
and a life after the similitude of the character and the life of God."—Christ's
Object Lessons, page 38.
   "Appreciation of the Bible grows with its study."—/bid., p. 132.
   "God will make the most precious revelations to His hungering, thirsting
people. They will find that Christ is a personal Saviour. As they feed upon
His word, they find that it is spirit and life. The word destroys the natural,
earthly nature, and imparts a new life in Christ jesus."—The Desire of Ages,
page 391.
   "The neglect of the word means starvation to the soul."—Counsels on
Sabbath School Work, page 44.

minimize the greatness of God by stating
that He is able to dwell in human hearts
that are surrendered to His will. Rather,
it exalts Him, for it shows Him to be omni-
present by His Spirit. God continues to
rule the vast universe from His throne in
heaven while at the same time through His
Spirit He dwells with the humble believer.

It is interesting to note that although this
 divine appearance was perhaps intended
more for Sarah's benefit than for Abraham's,
since he already knew and believed, the
Lord did not address Sarah directly until
she had first spoken to Him. Instead of
speaking to Sarah, He asked Abraham
whether anything could be too difficult for
the Lord. It was primarily to correct Sarah's
unbelief and to strengthen her faith that God
spoke thus. Where human wisdom and
strength fail, and where nature, enfeebled,
lacks ability to act, there God still has full
sway and brings things to pass according                                               NWM
