ChRISTIAN STEWARDSHIP IN ITS BR,OADFR ASPECTS

 SENIOR DIVISION, No. 258, FOURTH QUARTER, 19)9
          THE BLESSING OF DAILY STUDY
   "He who by faith receives the word is receiving the very life and character
of God. Every seed brings forth fruit after its kind.... Receive into the soul
by faith the incorruptible seed of the word, and it will bring forth a character
and a life after the similitude of the character and the life of God."—Christ's
Object Lessons, page 38.
   "Appreciation of the Bible grows with its study."—Ibid., p. 132.
   "God will make the most precious revelations to His hungering, thirsting
people. They will find that Christ is a personal Saviour. As they feed upon
His word, they find that it is spirit and life. The word destroys the natural,
earthly nature, and imparts a new life in Christ Jesus."—The Desire of Ages,
page 391.
   "The neglect of the word means starvation to the soul."—Counsels on
Sabbath School Work, page 44.

                   THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
                            December 26, 1959

    Forty-seven years ago, in 1912, the first Thirteenth Sabbath Offering
overflow went to India. Again this quarter we have the privilege of
doing something special for the Southern Asia Division. Think of the
five hundred million people in this great field, where there are only
twenty thousand Seventh-day Adventists, and we are sure you will
want to give a real Christmas sacrifice offering for Thirteenth Sabbath.
    The great majority of our believers in India are very poor in this
world's goods, though rich in faith. In the smaller towns and villages it
is impossible for them to provide themselves with even modest meeting
places, and so the Southern Asia Division Committee has dedicated a
part of the overflow for this quarter to building churches throughout
their field.
    Another crying need in this division is for medical work in Ceylon.
A portion of the overflow will go toward helping to start the work of
the right arm of the message in this needy area of the Southern Asia
Division.
    When planning Christmas gifts for your friends, remember your
best Friend.
