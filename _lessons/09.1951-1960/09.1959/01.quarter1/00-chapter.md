         THE BLESSING OF DAILY STUDY
   "He who by faith receives the word is receiving the very life and character
of God. Every seed brings forth fruit after its kind. . . . Receive into the soul
by faith the incorruptible seed of the word, and it will bring forth a character
and a life after the similitude of the character and the life of God."—Christ's
Object Lessons, page 38.
   "Appreciation of the Bible grows with its study."—Ibid., p. 132.
   "God will make the most precious revelations to His hungering, thirsting
people. They will find that Christ is a personal Saviour. As they feed upon
His word, they find that it is spirit and life. The word destroys the natural,
earthly nature, and imparts a new life in Christ Jesus."—The Desire of Ages,
page 391.
   "The neglect of the word means starvation to the soul."—Counsels on
Sabbath School Work, page 44.


                My Daily Lesson Study Pledge
   As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge of the Scriptures, I
pledge myself to the careful and prayerful study of some portion of my Sab-
bath school lesson each day of the week.
