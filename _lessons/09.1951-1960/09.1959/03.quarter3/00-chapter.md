         THE BLESSING OF DAILY STUDY
   "He who by faith receives the word is receiving the very life and character
of God. Every seed brings forth fruit after its kind. ... Receive into the soul
by faith the incorruptible seed of the word, and it will bring forth a character
and a life after the similitude of the character and the life of God."—Christ's
Object Lessons, page 38.
   "Appreciation of the Bible grows with its study."—Ibid., p. 132.
   "God will make the most precious revelations to His hungering, thirsting
people. They will find that Christ is a personal Saviour. As they feed upon
His word, they find that it is spirit and life. The word destroys the natural,
earthly nature, and imparts a new life in Christ Jesus."—The Desire ofAges,
page 391.
   "The neglect of the word means starvation to the soul.--Counsell on
Sabbath School Work, page 44.

                   Reconciliation Through Jesus Christ

MEMORY VERSE: "All things are of God, who hath reconciled us to Himself by
   Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation; to wit, that
   God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto Himself, not imputing their tres-
   passes unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation."

                    THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
                            September 26, 1959

   The Far Eastern Division is the field to benefit from the overflow of
the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering that will be received on September 26.
Three worthy projects have been chosen: (I) the establishment of an
evangelistic center in Seoul, Korea; (2) needed classrooms for the Indo-
nesian Union Seminary, Bandung, Java; (3) a middle school at the
Japan Missionary College.
   The needs surrounding any one of these projects are so great that it
could easily use the whole overflow offering, but an endeavor has been
made to stretch the money as far as possible. It is hoped that our Sab-
bath school members around the world will be just as liberal as possible
in their gifts on this Thirteenth Sabbath. The overflow will go to help
train young people to be workers in the cause of God in the great Far
Eastern Division and help also to increase the evangelistic efforts in the
fruitful land of Korea. In Seoul, Korea, prior to the Korean War we
had seven churches. Now, in that same area we have twenty-three
organized churches and companies, but many of them do not have
buildings in which to meet. The need for an evangelistic center in the
heart of the city is great. Let us keep these needs in mind as we plan our
offerings this quarter.
   The fields to benefit from the overflow for the next four quarters are:
   4th quarter—Southern Asia Division
   1st quarter (i96o)—Northern European Division
   2d quarter—Southern European Division
   3d quarter—Australasian Division
