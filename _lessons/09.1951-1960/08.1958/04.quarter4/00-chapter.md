         THE BLESSING OF DAILY STUDY
   "He who by faith receives the word is receiving the very life and character
of God. Every seed brings forth fruit after its kind. . . . Receive into the soul
by faith the incorruptible seed of the word, and it will bring forth a character
and a life after the similitude of the character and the life of God."—Christ's
Object Lessons, page 38.
   "Appreciation of the Bible grows with its study."—Ibid., p. 132.
   "God will make the most precious revelations to His hungering, thirsting
people. They will find that Christ is a personal Saviour. As they feed upon
His word, they find that it is spirit and life. The word destroys the natural,
earthly nature, and imparts a new life in Christ Jesus."—The Desire of Ages,
page 391.
   "The neglect of the word means starvation to the soul."—Counsels on
Sabbath School Work, page 44.

   As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge of the Scriptures, I
pledge myself to the careful and prayerful study of some portion of my Sab-
bath school lesson each day of the week.

  NOTE.—"Since the earlier years of his pro-
fession of faith, Mark's Christian experience
had deepened. As he had studied more
closely the life and death of Christ, he had
obtained clearer views of the Saviour's mis-
sion, its toils and conflicts. Reading in the
scars in Christ's hands and feet the marks
of His service for humanity, and the length
to which self-abnegation leads to save the
lost and perishing, Mark had become will-
ing to follow the Master in the path of self-
sacrifice. Now, sharing the lot of Paul the
prisoner, he understood better than ever be-
fore that it is infinite gain to win Christ,
infinite loss to win the world and lose the
soul for whose redemption the blood of                                      E1

                             December 27, 1958

   The overflow this quarter goes to the Inca Union in the South American
Division. The projects to benefit are as follows:
   1. The construction of a chapel for the Inca Union Junior College at
Lima, Peru. This will provide a meeting place for the student chapel hours
and a place for church services of the school.
   2. The building of an administration and classroom edifice for the Bolivia
Training School at Cochabamba, Bolivia. At the present time teachers are
obliged to hold their classes in dormitory rooms, and the administration
offices are crowded in a room in the kitchen-dining-room building.
    3. The completion of the classroom and administration building of the
Lake Titicaca Training School at Juliaca, Peru.
    4. The building of a medical-missionary institution at Cochabamba,

    May our Sabbath school members everywhere rally to this call for help
in the training of young people to carry the message in South America.
