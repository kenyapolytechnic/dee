         THE BLESSING OF DAILY STUDY
   "He who by faith receives the word is receiving the very life and character
of God. Every seed brings forth fruit after its kind. . . . Receive into the soul
by faith the incorruptible seed of the word, and it will bring forth a character
and a life after the similitude of the character and the life of God."—Christ's
Object Lessons, page 38.
   "Appreciation of the Bible grows with its study."—Mid., p. 132.
   "God will make the most precious revelations to His hungering, thirsting
people. They will find that Christ is a personal Saviour. As they feed upon
His word, they find that it is spirit and life. The word destroys the natural,
earthly nature, and imparts a new life in Chi-ist Jesus."—The Desire of Ages,
page 391.
   "The neglect of the word means starvation to the soul."—Counsels on
Sabbath School Work, page 44.

pledge myself to the careful and prayerful study of some portion of my Sab-
bath school lesson each day of the week.

there occurred, in the year 1755, the most
terrible earthquake that has ever been re-

earthquake of Lisbon, it extended to the
greater part of Europe, Africa, and Amer-
ica. It was felt in Greenland, in the West
Indies, in the island of Madeira, in Norway
and Sweden, Great Britain and Ireland. It
pervaded an extent of not less than four
million square miles. In Africa the shock
was almost as severe as in Europe. A great
part of Algiers was destroyed; and a short
distance from Morocco, a village contain-

swallowed up. A vast wave swept over the

                        THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING

                                       June 28, 1958

    This quarter we visit the islands of the Australasian Division and
give our money on the thirteenth Sabbath for two worthy projects. Ful-
ton Missionary College on the island of Fiji is one of the objectives to
benefit from the overflow. This school has a recruiting ground for stu-
dents covering an area of the Pacific about 4,000 by 3,000 miles, or, in
other words, the whole. Central Pacific Union Mission. The buildings of
this school are rapidly going to pieces in the tropical heat and rain, and
the enrollment is constantly increasing; so the time has come when they
need the following improvements: Bigger staff,, a library room, and
more books, woodwork classroom and woodwork shop and tools, new
chemistry and science equipment, water pipes for better water supply,
bigger and better buildings.
    The demand for trained workers has never been greater. Educational
standards are rising, and we must make provision for the proper train-
ing of those who will be the future leaders of the work in these island
fields.
    The highways between the islands are really waterways, and boats
instead of automobiles are the means of transportation. Another objec-
tive of the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering overflow this quarter is a new
 mission launch to be used in the New Britain area. The old boat is no
 longer seaworthy. Let us give them a new one on June 28.
