          THE BLESSING OF DAILY STUDY
    "He who by faith receives the word is receiving the very life and character
 of God. Every seed brings forth fruit after its kind. . . . Receive into the soul
 by faith the incorruptible seed of the word, and it will bring forth a character
 and a life after the similitude of the character and the life of God."—Christ's
'Object Lessons, page 38,
    "Appreciation of the Bible grows with its study."—Ibid., p. 132.
    "God will make the most precious revelations to His hungering, thirsting
 people. They will find that Christ is a personal Saviour. As they feed upon
 His word, they find that it is spirit and life. The word destroys the natural,
 earthly nature, and imparts a new life in Christ Jesus."—The Desire of Ages,
 page 391.
   "The neglect of the word means starvation to the soul."—Counsels on
 Sabbath School Work, page 44.


                 My Daily Lesson Study Pledge
   As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge of the Scriptures, I
pledge myself to the careful and prayerful study of some portion of my Sab-
bath school lesson each day of the week.

  5. According to the psalmist, why
was the Lord's banner to be dis-
played? Ps. 60:4, last part.


   NorE.—"Because of truth." Truth is
profoundly personal in its character. It
has no meaning apart from persons and
their response to it. Truth as a banner is
more than truth inscribed on a badge; one
may be orthodox, wear the badge, yet be a
pure pagan at heart and in life. To be a
Christian indeed means to follow truth's
banner where it leads: to submit to Christ's
Lordship in our lives whatever the cost. It          MARCHING UNDER CHRIST'S BANNER,

  NOTE.—"Love, the basis of creation and
of redemption, is the basis of true educa-
tion. This is made plain in the law that
God has given as the guide of life. The first
and great commandment is, 'Thou shalt
love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,
and with all thy soul, and with all thy
strength, and with all thy mind.' Luke
10:27. To love Him, the infinite, the om-
niscient One, with the whole strength, and
mind, and heart, means the highest de-
velopment of every power. It means that
in the whole being—the body, the mind,
as well as the soul—the image of God is
to be restored."—Education, page 16.

stroy the blessings of Sabbath observ-
ance? Ezek. 22:8; Mark 7:9.



   NOTE.—By causing God's children to be-
come careless and so despise or pollute the
Sabbath, Satan is successful in robbing
them of the blessings of Sabbath observ-
ance. By regarding the Sabbath as an ob-
stacle to business, and making the day
burdensome with human rules and tradi-
tions, the Sabbath, instead of being a sign
of sanctification, can become the sign of
disobedience.

Instead of choosing the graceful palm, the
lofty cedar, or the strong oak, Jesus takes
the vine with its clinging tendrils to repre-
sent Himself. The palm tree, the cedar,
and the oak stand alone. They require no
support. But the vine entwines about the
trellis, and thus climbs heavenward. So

upon divine power. 'I can of Mine own
self do nothing,' He declared."—The De-

                   THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
                        September 27, 1958

    The overflow of the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering this quarter goes to
the Inter-American Division, the second largest of our overseas divisions
and the fastest growing division in the world, with 125,000 church mem-
bers. Such a rapidly growing work naturally presents many problems
and many needs. A large proportion of the people are poor, and their
physical as well as their spiritual needs are many. This quarter we are
concentrating on three worthy projects; namely, an academic building
for the Seminaire Adventiste, Port-au-Prince, Haiti, in the Franco-Hai-
tian Union; an evangelistic and medical center for Caracas, Venezuela,
in the Colombia-Venezuela Union; and an outpatient clinic building for
the Andrews Memorial Hospital at Kingston, Jamaica, in the British
West Indies Union. Our schools and our medical institutions play an
important part in the spreading of the Good News of the return of Jesus.
Where would we find people to go out and give the message if we
could not train them in our own schools? How else could we reach the
millions of people who first hear, of Christ when they come to our
clinics and hospitals as patients?
    May we on this coming Thirteenth Sabbath make a sacrificial offer-
ing for the strengthening of these three institutions in the Inter-Ameri-
can field.
