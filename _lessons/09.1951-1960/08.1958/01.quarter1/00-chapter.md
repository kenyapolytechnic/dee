         THE BLESSING OF DAILY STUDY
   "He who by faith receives the word is receiving the very life and character
of God. Every seed brings forth fruit after its kind. . . . Receive into the soul
by faith the incorruptible seed of the word, and it will bring forth a character
and a life after the similitude of the character and the life of God."—Christ's
Object Lessons, page 38.
   "Appreciation of the Bible grows with its study."—Ibid., p. 132.
   "God will make the most precious revelations to His hungering, thirsting
people. They will find that Christ is a personal Saviour. As they feed upon
His word, they find that it is spirit and life. The word destroys the natural,
earthly nature, and imparts a new life in Christ Jesus."—The Desire of Ages,
page 391.
   "The neglect of the word means starvation to the soul."—Counsels on
Sabbath School Work, page 44.


                 My Daily Lesson Study Pledge

bath-school lesson each day of the week.

                                                  Christ has given special light as to how to
                                                  deal with those who are erring, and with

vise, no committee should recommend, nor
should any church vote, that the name of a
wrongdoer shall be removed from the
church books, until the instruction given
by Christ has been faithfully followed.
When this instruction has been followed,
the church has cleared herself before God.
The evil must then be made to appear as
it is, and must be removed, that it may
not become more and more widespread.
The health and purity of the church must
be preserved, that she may stand before
God unsullied, clad in the robes of Christ's
righteousness."—Testimonies, vol. 7, pp.

   NoTE.—The meal cannot adequately rep-
resent man, for the meal has no power of
itself to reject the leaven. Man has the
power of choice. He can either receive or
reject the leaven of truth. In the new-birth
experience man places himself in the hands
of God. He opens his heart to the leav-
ening influence of the gospel. But the leav-
ening work then has just begun. As a new-
born babe must grow into the stature of a
man, so the one who has received the new
leaven into his life must permit it to work
throughout his lifetime.

Spirit use to bring about this new re-

man's failure to respond to Christ's
call, what did he say? Matt. 19:27.


  NOTE.—Peter's question, "What shall we
have therefore?" placed him in a wrong
relation to Christ. It was the spirit of a
hireling, which is self-centered, suspicious,
and grudging. It measured carefully the
amount of work to be done with the com-
pensation that has been offered. This bar-
gaining spirit could never operate in the
spiritual world, chiefly because man could
never carry out his end of the bargain.

True Shepherd leaves the flock that love
Him, and goes out into the wilderness, en-
during hardship and facing danger and
death, to seek and save the sheep that has
wandered from the fold, and that must
perish if not brought back. When after
diligent search the lost is found, the Shep-
herd, though suffering from weariness, pain,
and hunger, does not leave it in its weak-
ness to follow Him. He does not drive it
back, but, oh wondrous love! He tenderly
gathers it in His arms, and placing it upon
His shoulder bears it to the fold. . . .

that of the lost piece of silver teach the

  8. In connection with a discourse
on His second coming, what did Jesus
say in regard to persistence in prayer?
Luke 18:1.


  Nom—The emphasis in this parable is
unwearied prayer for the second coming of
Christ. While the principles illustrated here
may be applied to prayer in general, it is
for His coming that He desires His disci-
ples to pray earnestly. If the church prayed
more zealously for His coming as He bade
us do when He told us to pray, "Thy king-
dom come," there would be fewer members
in the church who would excuse their
worldliness by declaring, "My Lord delay-
eth His coming."

emphasize the fact that the Householder
had only one Son, who was the heir, and
that therefore He was beloved above all

                        THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING

                                   March 29, 1958

       The overflow of the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering on March 29 goes
   to the Southern European Division to help to open two new mission
   stations in the West African mission fields of that division. The two
   particular fields to benefit are French Guinea and the Ubangi-Shari
   section of French Equatorial Africa. These are two very needy mission
   fields where practically no mission work has been done to date; but now
   the people from Ubangi-Shari have learned something of our work at
   the Batouri Mission, and they are calling for a school in their territory.
   In the whole of French Guinea we have only one lone believer. It is
   high time that we took the third angel's message into these needy
   fields. When the people are calling for light, that is the time to send it.
       May we bespeak on behalf of French West and Equatorial Africa
   a liberal Thirteenth Sabbath Offering on March 29?
