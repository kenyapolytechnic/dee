   "In his sinless state, man held joyful com-
munion with Him 'in whom are hid all the
treasures of wisdom and knowledge.' But
after his sin, he could no longer find joy in
holiness, and he sought to hide from the
presence of God. . . . The sinner could
not be happy in God's presence; he would
shrink from the companionship of holy be-
ings. Could he be permitted to enter heaven,
it would have no joy for him. . . . His
thoughts, his interests, his motives, would be
alien to those that actuate the sinless dwell-
ers there. He would be a discordant note in
the melody of heaven. Heaven would be to
him a place of torture.... They are shut out

                                              pray." The church is an assembly or society

     school members everywhere, it is once more making its appearance. The

  A major source for the notes and study helps in our Sabbath-
  school lessons from quarter to quarter is the spirit of ,prophecy.
  Some of these indispensable volumes which should be in every
  Sabbath-school member's library for easy reference are:

                THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
                March 27, 1954 — South American Division
    The South American Division is the field to benefit from the Thir-
teenth Sabbath Offering overflow this quarter. The South American
Division is one of our largest divisions, and within its territory is the
largest European population south of the equator. One of their urgent
needs is to train young people to carry on the work in the different
countries of this great field. Many schools have been established, and
they are full to overflowing with students. But facilities and equipment
in many of these schools .are altogether inadequate. Therefore the over-
flow from the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering this quarter will help to
provide a boys' :dormitory at each of our academies in the South Brazil
Union.
    The medical missionary work done on the rivers of South America
is one of the most effective pieces of missionary work we know of. This
quarter we will help to add another launch to our medical-evangelistic
fleet—this one to operate on the Araguaia River. South America is look-
ing to our Sabbath schools around the world for this much-needed
help on March 27.
