    with daily review or illustration during the week. Thus the lesson will become fixed in
    the memory, a treasure never to be wholly lost."—"Education," pages 251, 252.

                                        THE LESSON

   Covetousness Condemned and                        great sin is the covetous person guilty,
           Commended                                 and what will be his punishment?

                                     THE LESSON

           The Sin of Pride                       NOTE.-"Is not rash," is the marginal
                                               reading for "vaunteth not itself." "Love ...

tive, nor boastful and conceited." (Wey-
mouth.)
   Since love "is not puffed up," those con-
trolled by its power will not be wise in their
"own conceits." They will not be character-
ized by inflated ego or swollen self-conceit.
Love "does not swell or swagger," and is
"not inflated with vanity," are other trans-
lations of the statement in 1 Corinthians
13:4. Inflation always indicates a shrinkage
in value, as illustrated by financial inflation.
Being "puffed up" by pride always indicates
a little man attempting to hide his smallness
or ignorance.
   "Love vaunteth not itself. It is a humble
element; it never prompts a man to boast,
to exalt himself. Love for God and for our
fellow men will not be revealed in acts of
rashness nor lead us to be overbearing, fault-
finding, or dictatorial. Love is not puffed
up. The heart where love reigns will be
guided to a gentle, courteous, compassionate
course of conduct toward others, whether              NOTE.—"Lucifer desired God's power, but

                    THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING

                                June 26, 1954

   From the lands of the hummingbird, the sugar cane, coconut groves,
banana plantations, tropical forests, exotic flowers, golden beaches, vol-
canoes, chasms, and snow-capped mountain ranges—even from the
lands of Inter-America--come our mission appeals this quarter. In
these lands where the advent message is going rapidly, new facilities are
needed for keeping pace with the onward march of the message.
   This quarter the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering overflow will help to
provide increased facilities for the Colombia-Venezuela Training School
and the Caribbean Training College, as well as help to expand our
medical work in Central America. May we keep in mind the needs
of our young people and the needs of the sick and afflicted as we plan
for our Thirteenth Sabbath Offering on June 26.
