   with daily review or illustration during the week. Thus the lesson will become fixed in
   the memory, a treasure never to be wholly lost."—"Education," pages 251, 252.

   1. What condition in the last days
emphasizes the need of sound doc-

  2. In contrast to sound doctrine,
what other kinds of doctrines are
there? Jer. 10:8; 1 Tim. 1:4, 9, 10;                  NorE.—Commenting on this text, the

                         THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
               September 25, 1954-Northern European Division
        The overflow from the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering for the third quarter
   of 1954 is to be shared by four needy schools-our training schools at Kuyera,
   Ethiopia, and Konola, Liberia, and our secondary schools at Ihie, Nigeria,
   and Bekwai, Gold Coast.
        Realizing the heavy strain financially upon the Northern European
   Division in rehabilitating itself following World War II, we are made unusu-
   ally aware of the pressing needs of these schools in the mission fields of that.
   division.
        The students and teachers in Liberia, Nigeria, the Gold Coast, and
   Ethiopia greatly desire to have their schools advanced to complete secondary-
   school status. With the general present awakening in all of Africa, to accom-
   plish only this much seems imperative for the onward progress of the mes-
   sage. Let us not fail them on September 25.
