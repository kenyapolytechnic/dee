                        THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
                    December 25, 1954—Taiwan (Formosa)

   The Thirteenth Sabbath Offering overflow of the fourth quarter, 1954,
will help in establishing the first Seventh-day Adventist sanitarium-hospital
on the island of Taiwan (Formosa). It is hoped that the honest in heart who
come for physical healing to this institution will feel the evangelizing influ-
ence of the gospel and will be drawn to the Saviour.
   A number of former workers in China have taken up work among the
people of Taiwan, and a strong work is going forward through•the Voice
of Prophecy Bible correspondence courses and other lines of work. Those
who have labored long years in the Orient have shouldered the burden in this
land of opportunity. They are earnestly laboring here for the twelve million
people of the island, who are mainly Chinese. They are looking to Sabbath-
school members round the world to give them a helping hand, through the
Thirteenth Sabbath Offering, in building their much-needed sanitarium-
hospital.
