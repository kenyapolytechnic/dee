           THE BLESSING OF DAILY STUDY
   "The beauty and riches of the word have a transforming influence on mind
and character."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 132.
   "There is nothing more calculated to strengthen the intellect than the -study
of the Scriptures. No other book is so potent to elevate the thoughts, to give
vigor to the faculties, as the broad, ennobling truths of the Bible. If God's
word were studied as it should be, men would have a breadth of mind, a
nobility of character, and a stability of purpose rarely seen in these times."—
Steps to Christ, page 9o.
   The more you search the Scriptures with humble hearts, the greater will be
your interest. . . . Every day you should learn something new from the Scrip-
tures."—Testimonies,vol. 5, p. 266



                   My Daily Lesson Study Pledge
   As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge of the Scriptures, I
pledge myself to the careful and prayerful study of some portion of my Sab-
bath school lesson each day of the week.

Peter's words, a major theme of the

  NOTE.,—"The dominant theme of the NT
writers is the return of Christ. . . . The
disciples had witnessed Christ's ascension
(ch. 1:9, 10), and they realized He must
remain in heaven until His second advent.
Jesus had told His disciples that it was
necessary for Him to leave them (John 14:
1-6), but even they did not understand until
they saw Him ascend, and learned that
they must look for His return."—The Sev-

  1. What is the promise to those
who are found looking for the com-
ing of Jesus? Heb. 9:28.



  NoTE.—"This word 'appear' should be
given special attention. Christ, when He
comes the second time, will come in an
open, public manner; there will be nothing
secret about it; there will be nothing hid-

that is, He will be seen by the people dwell-
ing on the earth. . . .                               The guardian angels and the faithful they have   Y-1.4

present at the ascension of Jesus say

                                                 ascend to heaven? Acts 1:9.

                        THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING

                                   March 26, 1960

   This quarter the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering overflow is destined for the
Northern European Division. Three projects are to share in this offering.
Great are the opportunities with the printed page in Finland, but the work is
crippled for the lack of a press. A publishing house is urgently needed for
this part of the world field where our believers have been so zealous in their
work for the Lord. A second project is the providing of an evangelistic train-
ing center where workers may be trained to lead out in the work of soul win-
ning in West Africa. The third project is the establishing of an industrial
unit for our Ethiopian Training School where students may help earn their
way through school. All of these projects present a challenge to us in mission
advancement.
