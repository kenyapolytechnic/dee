           THE BLESSING OF DAILY STUDY
   "The beauty and riches of the word have a transforming influence on
mind and character."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 132.
   "There is nothing more calculated to strengthen the intellect than the
study of the Scriptures. No other book is so potent to elevate the thoughts,
to give vigor to the faculties, as the broad, ennobling truths of the Bible.
If God's word were studied as it should be, men would have a breadth of
mind, a nobility of character, and a stability of purpose rarely seen in
these times."—Steps to Christ, page go.
   "The more you search the Scriptures with humble hearts, the greater will
be your interest. . . . Every day you should learn something new from the
Scriptures."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 266.


                My Daily Lesson Study Pledge
   As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge of the Scriptures, I
pledge myself to the careful and prayerful study of some portion of my
Sabbath school lesson each day of the week.

                              The Law and the Gospel

MEMORY VERSE: "For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the
  flesh, God sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin,
   condemned sin in the flesh: that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled
   in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit." Rom. 8:3, 4.

prohibits false oaths and common swear-

God in a light or careless manner, without
regard to its awful significance. By the

matters, and by the frequent and thought-

                     THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING

                              September 24, 1960

   The overflow this quarter goes to the Australasian Division and
will be used for a new project—a hospital in New Guinea. Up to the
present time we have never been able to establish a hospital with a doc-
tor in charge in this fascinating mission field. In this land of rugged
mountains, beautiful valleys, and many rivers and lakes there are hun-
dreds of thousands of primitive people hidden away deep in the valleys
and mountains. Thousands of men and women who only a few years
ago were cannibals and had never heard the name of Jesus are today
rejoicing in the gospel and in Jesus as their personal Saviour.
   Among this multitude of people there are many sick and afflicted
who need to be cared for and who need to be taught how to care for
themselves. Our medical work has been the entering wedge in many
mission lands of earth, and surely we must answer the call of the
people of New Guinea to "come over and help" them. A site has been
selected in the Wabag Valley where there are 200,000 people all speak-
ing the same language.
    We solicit the prayers and offerings of our Sabbath school members
around the world in behalf of this new hospital in one of the far out-
posts of mission endeavor. We know you will do your part on Sep-
tember 24.
