           THE BLESSING OF DAILY STUDY
   "The beauty and riches of the word have a transforming influence on mind
and character."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 132.
   "There is nothing more calculated to strengthen the intellect than the study
of the Scriptures. No other book is so potent to elevate the thoughts, to give
vigor to the faculties, as the broad, ennobling truths of the Bible. If God's
word were studied as it should be, men would have a breadth of mind, a
nobility of character, and a stability of purpose rarely seen in these times."—
Steps to Christ, page 9o.
   "The more you search the Scriptures with humble hearts, the greater will
be your interest. . . . Every day you should learn something new from the
Scriptures."—Testimonies, vol. 5, page 266.

  7. Why is it impossible for man in
his own strength to obtain righteous-
ness? John 15:5; Jer. 13:23.


  NorE.—If man could become righteous
through his own strength, then the death of
Jesus was not necessary. "It was possible for
Adam, before the Fall, to form a righteous
character by obedience to God's law. But he
failed to do this, and because of his sin our
natures are fallen and we cannot make our-
selves righteous. Since we are sinful, unholy,
we cannot perfectly obey the holy law. We
have no righteousness of our own with which
to meet the claims of the law of God."—

                                                          NOTE.—The book of Acts was written
                                                       about thirty years after the resurrection of

                                                       facts regarding the apostolic Church. The
                                                       gospel religion taught in Acts exemplified the
                                                       faith of all the apostles. In it they express
                                                       their view of the teaching of Christ. Is it
                                                       not reasonable to believe that if Christ had

    Man's Creation and Nature                    gratitude."—Alexander Maclaren, D.D., in
                                                 Expositor's Bible, comment on Psalm 139:
  1. Who was the Creator of man,                 13-18.
and how was man made? Gen. 1:26,
27; 2:7. Compare Ps. 103:14.                                      Immortality

                                                 mortality? 1 Tim. 6:15, 16; 1:17.
  2. In what condition was man
when he came forth from the hands
of his Maker? Gen. 1:31. Compare                    NoTE.—The word "immortal" is defined
Eccl. 7:29.                                      by Webster as "exempt from liability to die."
                                                 God is the only being who possesses original
                                                 life or immortality in Himself. All others
                                                 must receive it from Him.

of his own creation, what was he led              from the enemy of all truth. This lie is ex-
to exclaim? Ps. 139:14.                           pressed in five words: "Ye shall not surely
                                                  die." These words form the foundation upon
                                                  which the theory of the immortality of man
                                                  is based—a poor foundation to build upon.

                                                         NOTE.—Jesus laid down His life, but He
                                                      was the "Prince of life." Acts 3:15. Because
                                                      He was sinless and holy He came forth from
                                                      the tomb. Rom. 1:4. As He was the Author
                                                      of eternal salvation, so He was "the Author

runs through the whole Bible. In sound sleep
one is wholly lost to consciousness; time
goes by unmeasured.

place of confinement is the "bottomless pit,"
or this earth. The expression "bottomless
pit" is the same in the Greek as that used
in the Septuagint translation of Genesis 1:2

   "That the expression 'bottomless pit' rep-
resents the earth in a state of confusion and
darkness is evident from other scriptures.

it `was_without form, and void; and darkness
was upon the face of the deep.' Genesis 1:2.

back, partially at least, to this condition....

Teaching is an art, and the best methods of teaching are
essential in developing strong Sabbath school instruction.
Knowing that no finer teaching techniques have ever been
found than those used by Jesus Christ, Elder Breitigam has
made an intensive study of the way Jesus taught men about
the kingdom of heaven. Every teacher from the cradle roll
to the senior division will appreciate the inspirational mate-
rial Elder Breitigam has gathered from the Bible, the spirit
of prophecy, and his own many years of experience. There
are also excellent check questions for thought and discussion.

               THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING

                          December 24, 1960

   How appropriate that we can give a special offering for Jesus on the
very eve, as it were, of the day that the world at large observes as the
birthday of our King. While the world celebrates the birth of Jesus by
giving gifts to one another, let us remember the great love gift that
He gave, for "greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down
his life for his friends."
   Here is our opportunity to show our love for Jesus by a gift that
will mean life for many of His "friends" in Inter-America. Our
hospitals around the world have meant life, physically and spiritually,
for many a sick and sin-sick soul. Through the overflow of the Thir-
teenth Sabbath Offering this quarter, we can help two hospitals, one in
Nicaragua and one in British Guiana, to pass on the gift of life.
   Furthermore, by helping to build a boys' dormitory for the new
boarding academy in Puerto Rico, we can have a part in training
workers for the cause of God, that they, too, may pass on the word of
life to many more of those "friends" of Jesus for whom He laid down
His life.
   Make your Christmas gift a love gift this year.
