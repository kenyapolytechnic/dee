          THE BLESSING OF DAILY STUDY
   "The beauty and riches of the word have a transforming influence on
mind and character."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 132.
   "There is nothing more calculated to strengthen the intellect than the
study of the Scriptures. No other book is so potent to elevate the thoughts,
to give vigor to the faculties, as the broad, ennobling truths of the Bible.
If God's word were studied as it should be, men would have a breadth of
mind, a nobility of character, and a stability of purpose rarely seen in
these times."—Steps to Christ, page go.
   "The more you search the Scriptures with humble hearts, the greater will
be your interest. . . . Every day you should learn something new from the
Scriptures."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 266.


               My Daily Lesson Study Pledge
   As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge of the Scriptures, I
pledge myself to the careful and prayerful study of some portion of my

         The Divine Purpose Fulfilled in the Christian Church

MEMORY VERSE: "Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the
  things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip. For if
  the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and dis-
  obedience received a just recompence of reward; how shall we escape, if
  we neglect so great salvation?" Heb. 2:1-3.

                         THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING
                   June 25, 1960, Southern European Division
       This quarter the overflow of the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering goes
   to the Southern European Division, which extends into three conti-
   nents: Europe, Africa, and Asia, where nearly 300,000,000 souls are to
   be evangelized. What a challenge!
       Our projects for the offering overflow this quarter will strengthen
   our evangelistic program. Two chapels are to be built—one in Novi
   Sad, Yugoslavia, and the other in Lourenco Marques, Mozambique,
   Africa. They are to be used as evangelistic centers for these two cities.
   At our Munguluni Mission in Mozambique the water supply is insuf-
   ficient and unhealthful. It is with a sense of urgency, therefore, that we
   provide a proper water supply for this mission, where also a new mis-
   sion home must be built. Let us sustain the work of God in these areas
   by a splendid offering on June 25.
       The fields to benefit from the overflow for the next four quarters
    are: Third quarter—Australasian Division
          Fourth quarter—Inter-American Division
          First quarter, i961—Middle East Division
          Second quarter—Southern African Division
