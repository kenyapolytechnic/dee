Sabbath School Members,
World Divisions of the
   Seventh-day Adventist Church.

Dear Member,

     Greetings in the Lord from more than 200,000 fellow Sabbath School
members in the 18 nations of the Northern Europe - West Africa Division!

     First of all a word of thanks to you for the help given in the last
Thirteenth Sabbath Special Project Offering. The library at the Adventist
Seminary of West Africa is almost complete. The additions to the junior
college in Finland now help that school function smoothly. The last of
the projects to get under way - the new Publishing House building for
Norway - is being built. Thank you for making this possible.

     Now for the new projects your offerings will help this June 30.

     The first of these is part of a new health strategy for West Africa.
Despite the loss of several of our hospitals to government expropriation
we are trying to help more people than ever before. To do this we are
establishing small clinic buildings throughout West Africa with mobile
units attached. These will take health to the people where they are,
through on-the-spot check-ups, out-patient treatments and public health
lectures. So we are asking you to help us put a clinic into the Togo-
Benin mission with a mobile unit attached. This will also be the first
organized health work in the French-speaking territories of this Division.

     Two schools will benefit from the special project offering. In
Sweden the historic campus and buildings of Ekebyholm Junior College
will be enhanced by the construction of a Gymnasium and assembly hall.
In England, a similar unit will be constructed on the beautiful Stanborough
Park estate. Throughout the European section of the Division schools are
essential to the spiritual welfare and evangelistic growth of the church.
Both these structures will serve these purposes.

     While you are lifting your sights toward our needs we are joining
you in seeking to finish the work in our territories. This year we have
a faith objective of 1000 souls baptized each month. Will you join us
in praying that we shall reach and surpass this objective?

      God bless you for your support and your prayers,




                                                                 Walter R.I. Scragg, resident

                    THE LAST HOUR
                                   Introduction
   The daily news reveals more and more that the end is near. Crime, violence, immor-
ality, political animosity, cold and hot wars, general fear, anxiety, the deterioration of
economic conditions even in the most developed countries—these are impressive
fulfillments of Bible predictions for the last days of history. Political corruption and
eroding stability at all levels of society produce decay of public confidence; respect
for law and order vanishes even in traditionally conservative areas; exploding
population brings distress to lands already overcrowded and hungry. In the modern
religious world new theologies undermine the basic principles of the gospel of
Jesus Christ, rejecting the law of God as the supreme moral code. All of these and
more constitute eloquent signs that the second coming of Christ is at hand.
   We do not need to delineate here such an apparent fact. Every church member is
convinced of it. Even the world is aware of it. We have these words from the in-
spired pen: "Rulers and statesmen, men who occupy positions of trust and author-
ity, thinking men and women of all classes, have their attention fixed upon the
events taking place about us. They are watching the strained, restless relations that
exist among the nations. They observe the intensity that is taking possession of
every earthly element, and they recognize that something great and decisive is about
to take place—that the world is on the verge of a stupendous crisis."—Education,
p. 179.
   In these lessons we will remind the students that not only will the world pass
through troublous times, but the church itself shall experience a difficult crisis. This
will affect every one of us.
   During this time of crisis the enemy will make the final and most desperate
effort to appeal to every believer in such a way as to cause his alienation from Christ
and bring about his final destruction. He will adapt his attacks according to the par-
ticular weaknesses of every individual.
   "At that time the superficial, conservative class, whose influence has steadily
retarded the progress of the work, will renounce the faith and take their stand with
its avowed enemies."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 463.
   God has made ample provision for every one of His children to go through this
crisis victoriously. All the inspired predictions regarding the nature and the alterna-
tives of this crisis have been laid out before us, both in the Bible and in the
writings of the spirit of prophecy.
   All the means of grace have been put at our disposal, so that no one need fail
in the hour of darkness. We have been told that "the weapons of our warfare are not
carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds" (2 Cor. 10:4).
   It is easy to lean toward conformity, lukewarmness, and partial commitment to
Christ. We should, by the grace of God, make two resolutions: (1) to study with
wholehearted interest the inspired records in order to become acquainted with what
we have to face in these last days; (2) to "put on the whole armour of God" not
overlooking any of the means that Heaven has provided for growth in our Christian
experience.
   By implementing these two resolutions we make ours the victory already won by
 Christ in our behalf, allowing God to fulfill His wonderful promises in our life.
   During this quarter we will concentrate on encouraging the reader to draw nearer
to Christ and to endure in the crisis we face.
   Next quarter our subject will be: Be Ready! We will study how we can be fully
 prepared for the crisis which we are entering, develop fruits of the Spirit, receive the
 former and the latter rain, be sealed, and be endowed with the mighty power of God
 to finish His work.

             Part 1 A. Shaking.
     EVENTS DURING
      PROBATION—I     "Lo, I will command,
                        and shake the house of Israel among all the nations,
                      as one shakes with a sieve,
                        but no pebble shall fall upon the earth" (Amos 9:9, RSV).

                        In this prophecy it was ancient Israel that was to be shaken,
                     but Ellen White uses this figure of "shaking" to refer also to a
                     time when many who are numbered among the people of God
                     will apostatize. (See Testimonies, vol. 1, pp. 332, 431; Early
                     Writings, pp. 273-276.) Many will leave the church because they
                     did not accept the divine call to conversion, and reformation.
                        "Satan will work his miracles to deceive; he will set up his
                     power as supreme. The church may appear as about to fall, but
                     it does not fall. It remains, while the sinners in Zion will be
                     sifted out—the chaff separated from the precious wheat. This is
                     a terrible ordeal, but nevertheless it must take place."—Ellen G.
                     White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 911.

                     B. Reformation.

                       What greatly needed experience of Israel of old is a prime
                     necessity in these days? Joel 2:12, 13.
                        "A revival of true godliness among us is the greatest and
                     most urgent of all our needs. To seek this should be our first
                     work."—Selected Messages, bk. 1, p. 121.
                       The shaking will occur as a counterpart of revival and ref-
                     ormation. Under the powerful proclamation of the message of
                     Christ and His righteousness—understood both as forgiveness
                     and as obedience by faith and reception of His perfect charac-
                     ter—many will turn completely to the Lord, and they will step
                     forward as one man to finish God's work on earth.

THINK IT THROUGH       Why is it that many will not participate in the reformation
                     within the church, but will be shaken? How can I prevent this
                     tragedy in my own case?

                      "There must be earnest effort to obtain the blessing of the
                    Lord, not because God is not willing to bestow His blessing
                    upon us, but because we are unprepared to receive it. Our heav-
                    enly Father is more willing to give His Holy Spirit to them that
                    ask Him, than are earthly parents to give good gifts to their
                    children. But it is our work, by confession, humiliation, repent-
                    ance, and earnest prayer, to fulfill the conditions upon which
                    God has promised to grant us His blessing."—Selected Mes-
                    sages, bk. 1, p. 121.

Future Events      LESSON 1                                          ❑    Monday
                                                                           April 2
          Part 2   C. Sealing.
  EVENTS DURING
   PROBATION—II      "Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we
                   have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads"
                   (Rev. 7:3).

                      In order to prepare His children for the time of trouble, God
                   desires to seal them, to stamp upon them the seal of His law,
                   of His character, of His perfection. This process is taking place
                   right now and will soon be over. It is a personal work done by
                   the Holy Spirit, and it can be described as a process of sanctifi-
                   cation which starts at conversion and ends with the close of
                   probation—whether at the death of the believer or at the end of
                   the investigative judgment. The sign of the seal of God is the
                   true observance of the Sabbath in a time of persecution. Such
                   loyalty demands a dedication that goes deep into the Christian
                   experience.

                   D. Latter Rain.

                     What great promise to Judah in Joel 2:23, 28, 29 has signifi-
                   cance also for the last days?

                   E. Finishing of God's Work.

                     To what event does Revelation 10:7 point?

                      According to the great principle enunciated by the prophet
                   Zechariah, it is "not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit,
                   saith the Lord of hosts" that the proclamation of the last mes-
                   sage will be done and the work will be finished.
                      The completion of God's work is not an uncertain issue in the
                   Bible. Many promises and prophecies assure its success. Reve-
                   lation 10:7 is just one of the promises.
                      The promise of the latter rain is for today, and not for some
                   future time. But there are certain requisites for the reception
                   of this great gift: the emptying of self, victory over sin in all
                   its varieties, and a total commitment to witnessing for God.

THINK IT THROUGH     What can I do to foster the sealing process in my life and to
                   partake in the experience of the latter rain?

                     "Those who receive the seal of the living God and are pro-
                   tected in the time of trouble must reflect the image of Jesus
                   fully."—Early Writings, p. 71.
                     "When one is fully emptied of self, when every false god is
                   cast out of the soul, the vacuum is filled by the inflowing of the
                   Spirit of Christ."—Gospel Workers, p. 287.

     EVENTS DURING the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as
     PROBATION—III many as would not worship the image of the beast should be
                   killed. And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and

                   their foreheads: and that no man might buy or sell, save he
                   that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of
                   his name" (Rev. 13:15-17).

                      F. Civil Enforcement of Sunday Observance.

                        The lamblike beast of Revelation 13, which represents the
                      United States of America, is the subject to which verses 15 to 17
                      refer. This great country, through the constitutional principles
                      of religious freedom and separation of church and state, has
                      achieved a high degree of religious freedom. But unfortunately
                      the time will come when it will legislate on matters of religion.
                      These laws will require of Sabbath keepers a violation of the
                      fourth commandment.

                      G. Beginning of Persecution.

                         Religious legislation will mark the start of persecution. The
                      lamblike beast will speak like a dragon. The dragon of Revela-
                      tion 12 is a persecuting power. The second beast (the U.S.) will
                      oblige all the inhabitants of the world to worship the first beast,
                      Rome (verse 12). It will command all those who dwell on the
                      earth to make an image to the first beast, namely, the Roman
                      power (verse 14). Since this beast exercised both civil and
                      religious power, the image of the beast will be another power
                      doing the same thing. This image will be formed by those
                      Protestant churches that will persuade the state to impose
                      religious laws. Also the lamblike beast will cause all to receive
                      the mark of the beast. And "the mark of the beast is . . . the
                      observance of the first day of the week."—Testimonies, vol. 8,
                      p. 117. Under the image of the beast Sabbath keepers will be
                      denied the right to buy and sell (verse 17).

                      H. Leaving the Large Cities.

                         After the Sunday law has been imposed nationwide in the
                      United States, it will very soon become a worldwide obligation.
                      This will be the sign for the people of God to leave the big
                      cities and go to rural areas or to less-populated places.

THINK IT THROUGH        What would help me today to be prepared in order to make
                      the great decision of loyalty to God when the mark of the
                      beast will be imposed?

                                                                        April 4

           Part 4     What description does Daniel give of the time of trouble
        THE TIME    that begins at the end of the investigative judgment?
     OF TROUBLE
                      "At that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which
                    standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a
                    time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation
                    even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be
                    delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book"
                    (Dan. 12:1).

                       When the investigative judgment that began in 1844 is finished
                    and the decree of Revelation 22:11 is pronounced, Michael—
                    Christ—will stand up. He will leave the sanctuary, where He is
                    interceding for sinners. He will take off His priestly robe and will
                    put on His kingly garments. Probation will close. The forgiving
                    grace of God through the blood of Christ will no longer be
                    available. All the world will be in great affliction. The seven last
                    plagues will be poured upon the impenitent.
                       Although the children of God, the sealed ones, will be pro-
                    tected from the plagues, they also will undergo unmatched
                    anguish, first, because of the persecution, and, second, because
                    of a short but intensive time of spiritual anxiety about their past
                    sins. But God will not allow one of the saints to lose his life dur-
                    ing this time. The spiritual anxiety will be brief. Uncertainty will
                    be banished soon.

                      Note about the order of events preceding the time of trouble.

                      The order given in the lesson for events preceding the end of
                    probation is not necessarily the order in which these events will
                    happen. Nevertheless there is some logic in the sequence. The
                    shaking and the reform movement will begin'before the falling
                    of the latter rain, and the latter rain will start before the finish-
                    ing of God's work. During a certain period of time the shaking,
                    the reformation, the sealing, the latter rain, and the loud cry
                    will be happening together. All of them will end at the close of
                    probation.

THINK IT THROUGH      Why is it necessary for the children of God—after the seal-
                    ing—to go through a time of trouble? Why does God allow us
                    to suffer even now?

              Part 5     A. Seven Last Plagues. (Read Revelation 16:1, and then
     EVENTS DURING     broaden your vision by reading verses 2 through 21.)
        THE TIME OF
           TROUBLE       During the time of trouble the seven last plagues will be fall-
                       ing upon the world, but they will affect only the impenitent. No
                       obedient child of God will receive any physical harm. "I will be
                       with him in trouble" is the promise. (Read Psalm 91.)

                         B. Death Decree and Fleeing From Small Towns (Rev. 13:15).

                          A death decree will be issued against those who observe the
                       Sabbath. They will be cited as enemies of law and order and the
                       cause of all the calamities. A specific date for executing the
                       decree will be set. When this is announced, the commandment
                       keepers will flee from all populated centers and will seek refuge
                       in forests, deserts, and rocky places, where they will have the
                       special protection of God. In the very night set for the death
                       sentence to be carried out God will miraculously deliver His
                       people.

                         C. Persecution and Divine Protection (2 Tim. 3:12; Rev. 3:10).
                         Although God's people will be severely persecuted, holy an-
                       gels will defend the loyal ones.

                         D. Armageddon (Rev. 16:12-16).
                          Armageddon will be the last conflict between good and evil
                       before the advent. It comes under the sixth plague. The earthly
                       powers allied against the saints will be the dragon (spiritual-
                       ism), the beast (the papacy, Rome), and the false prophet (apos-
                       tate Protestantism).
                          "Two great opposing powers are revealed in the last great
                       battle. On one side stands the Creator of heaven and earth. All
                       on His side bear His signet. They are obedient to His commands.
                       On the other side stands the Prince of darkness, with those who
                       have chosen apostasy and rebellion."—Ellen G. White, Review
                       and Herald, May 7, 1901.
                         Miracle-working spirits of devils will deceive the rulers of all
                       the world, to mislead, destroy, and persecute. On the very day
                       set for the carrying out of the death sentence the Lord will
                       paralyze the wicked with a great commotion of the heavens and
                       the earth and with an extraordinary display of power in the
                       natural elements. Soon after this the majestic sight of the re-
                       turning Son of God will appear in the heavens.

THINK IT THROUGH         Is it enough for me to be acquainted with what is going to
                       happen during the time of trouble? What is needed in addition
                       to knowledge?

   THE SAINTS TO
     THE ADVENT     Here is a review, summarized from The Great Controversy,
                  chapter 40, of the events that will take place between the liber-
                  ation of God's people and the second coming of Jesus:
                    A. The Liberation Itself.
                    Wicked men halt as they are about to destroy God's people.
                    The sun shines at midnight.
                    God's voice is heard, saying, "Look up" and "It is done."
                    B. Successive Signs and Wonders.
                    Rivers cease to run.
                    The voice of God shakes the heavens and the earth.
                    A great earthquake.
                    Hail makes a terrible destruction.
                    The cities fall in ruins.
                    Prison walls are rent, and children of God are freed.
                    C. A Partial Resurrection occurs in which all participate who
                  died in the faith of the third angel's message and those who
                  took part in the death of Christ.
                    D. A Hand Appears in the Sky Holding the Tables of the Law.
                    E. Enemies of God's Law, Full of Despair, Curse Their False
                  Shepherds; the weapons which were to slay God's people are
                  now employed to destroy the false ministers.
                     F. The Voice of God Proclaims the Day and the Hour of
                  Christ's Coming.
                    G. A Small Cloud Appears That Envelops the Saviour.
                     H. All the Righteous Are Resurrected.
                     I. The Living Righteous Are Transformed and Glorified.
                     J. Both Groups Are Caught Up Together to Meet the Lord.
                     K. The Wicked Still Living Are Destroyed by the brightness of
                  His coming.
                     L. Christ Confers Upon His Followers the Emblems of Victory
                  and opens the pearly gates of the Holy City, and the redeemed
                  enter.

                     What is the only way of assuring our liberation? Rev. 12:11;
                    Rom. 13:14.

                      The blood of the Lamb has washed away all sins, giving the
                    saints a complete forgiveness because of their faith in Jesus as
                    their personal Saviour, and that blood also has given them
                    power over sinful habits and defects of character. On the other
                    hand, the saints will have overcome the devil by the word of
                    their testimony.

   "These things write I unto thee,
hoping to come unto thee shortly: but
if I tarry long, that thou mayest
know how thou oughtest to behave
thyself in the house of God, which is
the church of the living God, the
pillar and ground of the truth"
(1 Tim. 3:f4, 15).


  During this quarter and the next we
plan to study a series of events that
should stir the church. Therefore we
will first study about the church of
God on earth.
  How does the Bible define and
describe the church? What are the
main purposes for which it was
established by God on this planet?
What is its function? What great
ideals does God have for it? How did
the Lord relate Himself to it in the
past, and what is His present
relationship? What are His promises
for its future?
  The Word of God expresses a deep
feeling of love and tender
consideration by our heavenly Father
toward the church, as well as toward
every one of His children.
  We will see how the church, the ark
of salvation, the house of God on
earth, has been marvelously protected
in persecution and has been tenderly
loved by God in spite of its
weaknesses.                             DAILY HIGHLIGHTS
  We will be assured by past            1. Definition and Function

               Part 1     What does Paul call the church of God?
          DEFINITION
       AND FUNCTION       "If I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest
                        to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of
                        the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth" (1 Tim. 3:15).

                           Soon after the beginning of human history the world became
                        divided between the obedient "sons of God" and the disobedi-
                        ent "children of men." God purposed from the first to call out a
                        people to represent Him in the world. These members of
                        God's family would live in the world but not belong to the
                        world. God's people sojourning in a strange land belonged to
                        what the Bible calls "the church in the wilderness" (Acts 7:38).
                           The New Testament word "church" is translated from the
                        Greek word ekklesia, which was used to designate .a public
                        convocation. This word has three basic meanings used in the
                        New Testament: (1) The meeting of the children of God (Acts
                        14:27); (2) the Christians who lived in a definite area (1 Cor.
                        1:2); and (3) the universal church or people of God (Matt. 16:18).
                        We will be studying the church in this last meaning.
                           God has designed His church to be the ark of salvation from
                        the flood of sin in the world. It is the "house of God," the insti-
                        tution where Christians assemble for fellowship and for worship
                        and communion with the heavenly Father. Also God wanted
                        to have His church as a means of preserving His truth.

                          What is another important function of the church? 1 Cor. 1:
                        2-7; 1 Cor. 12:28.

                           Writing to the church, Paul says that its members are to
                        "come behind in no gift" of the Holy Spirit. Later, in 12:28, he
                        names several gifts. So one purpose of the church is to be the
                        receptacle for the gifts named there. Therefore the manifesta-
                        tion of the gifts would come in the midst of the "church"—the
                        only true church of God.

                          Besides the fact that the church is the house of God on
                        earth, a center of fellowship and Christian growth, and the
                        receptacle of spiritual gifts, what is another one of her main
                        objectives? Acts 1:8; Matt. 28:19.

THINK IT THROUGH          Why is my attendance at church an important factor in my
                        spiritual growth? How do I go about making every church
                        service a real encounter with God?

                                                                         April 9

           Part 2   What is God's ideal for His church?
     GOD'S IDEAL
        FOR THE     "Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; that
        CHURCH he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by
                  the word, that he might present it to himself a glorious church,
                  not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it
                  should be holy and without blemish" (Eph. 5:25-27).

                      "Sanctify and cleanse. Christ took away the filthy garments
                   and gave, instead, the robe of His perfect righteousness... .
                      "Washing. Gr. loutron, 'bath,' bathing place,' or 'bathing.'
                   The word occurs elsewhere in the NT only in Titus 3:5, where it
                   appears in the expression 'washing of regeneration.' Since the
                   context is that of marriage, there is probably an allusion to the
                   ancient custom of the purifying bath of the bride before mar-
                   riage. Or the reference may be to baptism. In either case, the
                   idea is that Christ has purified the church. Christ gave Him-
                   self for the church that she might become a pure church, and so
                   abide with Him forever."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 6,
                   p. 1037.
                      "Those who are living upon the earth when the intercession
                   of Christ shall cease in the sanctuary above are to stand in the
                   sight of a holy God without a mediator. Their robes must be
                   spotless, their characters must be purified from sin by the blood
                   of sprinkling...
                      ". . . Then the church which our Lord at His coming is to
                   receive to Himself will be a 'glorious church, not having spot,
                   or wrinkle, or any such thing.' "—The Great Controversy,
                   p. 425.

THINK IT THROUGH      Am I devoting enough time to being alone with God every
                   day in the study and meditation of His word (in the Bible and
                   in the spirit of prophecy writings) and in secret prayer in order
                   to grow toward this ideal?

                       "How are you to know that you are accepted of God? Study
                    His word prayerfully. Lay it not aside for any other book. This
                    Book convinces of sin. It plainly reveals the way of salvation....
                       "Do not neglect secret prayer, for it is the soul of religion.
                    With earnest, fervent prayer, plead for purity of soul. Plead as
                    earnestly, as eagerly, as you would for your mortal life, were
                    it at stake. Remain before God until unutterable longings are
                    begotten within you for salvation, and the sweet evidence is
                    obtained of pardoned sin."—Testimonies, vol. 1, p. 163.

                        "The church of Christ is very precious in His sight. It is the

                       What does Paul say about the relationship of God with His
                     church? Eph. 5:25, 29.

                        "We should remember that the church, enfeebled and defec-
                     tive though it be, is the only object on earth on which Christ
                     bestows His supreme regard. He is constantly watching it with
                     solicitude, and is strengthening it by His Holy Spirit."—Selected
                     Messages, bk. 2, p. 396.
                        Those who speak against the church and try to degrade it are
                     directly condemned by the Bible and the spirit of prophecy, be-
                     cause there is no other institution so dear to the heart of God
                     as His church. It may have great deficiencies, but still Christ
                     loves it and protects it as the object of His supreme love.
                        A great task has been committed to the church. Its members
                     are to represent Christ's character and carry His message to all
                     the world. The church has not yet fulfilled the purpose for which
                     it has been called.
                        God has chastened it many times and has drawn it to Him over
                     and over again. But still it lacks faith and needs the deep trust
                     in Jesus that results in being clothed in His righteousness.
                        Meanwhile, it is being used by God as His agency in this world
                     for spreading the good news until the end of probation.

THINK IT THROUGH        Do I feel the love of God and the tender regard of Christ
                     as something not only exercised toward the church at large,
                     but also toward me personally? Do I dwell every day on this
                     loving affection of my Saviour and feel myself more strongly
                     linked with Him?

                       "The church is very precious in God's sight. He values it,
                     not for its external advantages, but for the sincere piety which
                     distinguishes it from the world. He estimates it according to
                     the growth of the members in the knowledge of Christ, accord-

Christ With His Church        LESSON 2                           ❑ Wednesday
                                                                     April 11

          Part 4   What promise of Christ to His church has been fulfilled
    CHRIST WITH through the ages?
    THE CHURCH
       MILITANT    "Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is
                 given unto me in heaven and in earth.... I am with you alway,
                 even unto the end of the world." (Matt. 28:18-20).

                     The great controversy between good and evil, between truth
                   and error, between Christ and Satan, has caused the church to
                   pass through times of great trials and difficulties and even
                   through episodes of apostasy.
                      In Old Testament times Israel became largely corrupted and
                   no longer fulfilled the purpose of God. That purpose was to
                   represent His perfect character before the pagan nations and to
                   proclaim His name in a practical way. So God intervened. He
                   allowed some of these countries to conquer Israel and Judah.
                   The rebel people of God were taken captive and lived for 70
                   years in foreign lands. But God never forsook His people. And
                   after the 70 years the nation was brought back to Palestine to
                   begin a new era.
                      Israel rejected God when it refused to receive Christ; there-
                   fore He established the new or modern Israel, the Christian
                   church. But the door of salvation is still open for the individual
                   Jew.
                      This church went through great troubles. During the days of
                   imperial Rome, and also during the Middle Ages under papal
                   Rome, the church was greatly persecuted. Millions of the chil-
                   dren of God testified of their faith in Christ by suffering and
                   martyrdom.
                      There were times when the group apostatized, but God al-
                   ways had a smaller group who were loyal to Him and His
                   commandments.
                      All through the ages God has been with His church, and
                   Christ has fulfilled His wonderful promise. Since we are again
                   approaching times of restriction and persecution, we should
                   keep our eyes on Jesus, the Author and Finisher of our faith,
                   who will be with us individually and as a church, so that the
                   great purpose of God may be realized.
                      Chastened many times for its apostasy, but not forgotten—
                   persecuted and afflicted, but not abandoned by God—the
                   church will continue to have the special leadership and pro-
                   tection of God.

THINK IT THROUGH     "Christ is spoken of as walking in the midst of the golden
                   candlesticks. Thus is symbolized His relation to the churches.
                   He is in constant communication with His people."—The Acts

                    How does Jesus predict the glorious triumph of His church?
           Part 5
     THE CHURCH     "I saw and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him
     TRIUMPHANT had a bow; and a crown was given unto him; and he went
                  forth conquering, and to conquer" (Rev. 6:2).

                      The white horse represents specifically the apostolic church
                   of the first century. It also has a general meaning (see S.D.A.
                   Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 776) and in this interpretation
                   is a symbol of the church of God in all ages. The full conquest
                   achieved by the rider on the white horse is a prediction of the
                   victorious Jesus at the head of His church. This triumph will
                   take place in spite of the persecution and troubles that have
                   plagued the church of God.

                    How does the revelator picture the triumphant church of
                   God of all the ages? Rev. 7:9, 10.

                     He sees a white-robed and happy multitude, so great that no
                   one is able to number them. They hold palms and sing a song
                   of victory, attributing all the glory to God. This vast throng is
                   made up of human beings saved by the blood of Jesus all
                   through the ages, those who from Abel to the last martyr have
                   given testimony with their life, all those who by faith in Jesus
                   have been counted as faithful members of the family of God.

                     What other symbol is used in the Bible to represent the
                   church in her last triumphant march toward victory? Song of
                   Solomon 6:10.

                     "Clad in the armor of Christ's righteousness, the church is
                   to enter upon her final conflict. [Song of Solomon 6:10
                   quoted.]"—Prophets and Kings, p. 725.

THINK IT THROUGH      How can I contribute to the excellency of the church—help-
                   ing it to be true to its allegiance and to prepare for the hour of
                   final victory?

                      "The church is God's agency for the proclamation of truth,
                   empowered by Him to do a special work; and if she is loyal to
                   Him, obedient to all His commandments, there will dwell within
                   her the excellency of divine grace. If she will be true to her
                   allegiance, if she will honor the Lord God of Israel, there is
                   no power that can stand against her."—The Acts of the Apos-

          Part 6     What position in the church does Paul say Jesus holds?
    CHRIST, THE
   HEAD AND THE      "He is the head of the body, the church: who is the begin-
    FOUNDATION     ning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might
                   have the preeminence" (Col. 1:18).

                      Read also Eph. 5:23.
                      In a body every member is very important, and when one is
                   injured all the body suffers. But the head is the most important
                   part. The body cannot function or live without the head. There
                   we find the most vital part of our system, the brain, the head-
                   quarters of the personality, the center of the nervous system.
                   Likewise, in the church as a body, Christ is the head. Everything
                   depends upon Him, and the connection of every member with
                   Him is as vital as the connection of every member of the body
                   with the head.

                     By what symbol did Christ Himself emphasize this great
                   truth? Matt. 16:18.

                      On Christ Himself, the great Rock of Ages, He built His church,
                   and this is why it is so stable in spite of all adversities, tempta-
                   tions, and dangers.

                     Using another illustration, how does Paul teach this great
                   fact? 1 Cor. 3:11. (See Eph. 2:20.)

                     A building, to be of lasting value, requires a firm foundation.
                   A poor foundation can make it unsafe for occupancy. No other
                   feature of the building can make up for weakness at the base.
                   The foundation is the most vital part of any edifice. Thank God
                   that the foundation of the church "standeth sure," because it is
                   none other than the Rock of Ages.
                     "Men may suppose that they have found a new way, that they
                   can lay a stronger foundation than that which has been laid;
                   but this is a great deception. 'Other foundation can no man
                   lay than that is laid.' In the past, many have undertaken to build
                   a new faith, to establish new principles; but how long did their
                   building stand? It soon fell; for it was not founded upon the
                   Rock.
                     "Did not the first disciples have to meet the sayings of men?
                   did they not have to listen to false theories; and then, having
                   done all, to stand firm, saying, 'Other foundation can no man
                   lay than that is laid'? So we are to hold the beginning of our

         BLESSED
      PURPOSE OF       "All that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecu-
     PERSECUTION    tion" (2 Tim. 3:12).

                       The statement of the apostle is straightforward and strong.
                    It seems that a consecrated life stirs up the powers of darkness
                    and enrages Satan. On the other hand many times persecution
                    has been the means of awakening interest in the truth and at-
                    tracting sincere people to God. Could it be that many times the
                    lack of persecution may be a sign of the lack of real godly living
                    in the church?

                      What attitude did Peter urge believers of his day to take
                    toward persecution? 1 Peter 4:12-14.

                      "Of all the gifts that heaven can bestow upon men, fellowship
                    with Christ in His sufferings is the most weighty trust and the
                    highest honor. Not Enoch, who was translated to heaven, not
                    Elijah, who ascended in a chariot of fire, was greater or more
                    honored than John the Baptist, who perished alone in the dun-
                    geon. 'Unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to
                    believe on Him, but also to suffer for His sake.' Philippians
                    1:29."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 478.

                      What does Paul say is the end result of suffering? Rom.
                    8:18, 28.

                        God has a wonderful purpose in allowing us to go through
                     difficulties. Every bitter cup that He asks us to drink is a manifes-
                     tation of His love toward us.
                        "The fact that we are called upon to endure trial shows that
                    the Lord Jesus sees in us something precious which He desires
                    to develop. If He saw in us nothing whereby He might glorify
                    His name, He would not spend time in refining us. He does not
                    cast worthless stones into His furnace."—The Ministry of Heal-

            Part 2   What happened to the prophets of old while they were faith-
     PERSECUTION fully carrying on their duty?
      IN THE PAST
                     "Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted?
                   and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming
                   of the Just One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and
                   murderers" (Acts 7:52).

                       Of Jeremiah, one of the most persecuted of the prophets,
                    Ellen White says: "When called to drink of the cup of tribula-
                    tion and sorrow, and when tempted in his misery to say, 'My
                    strength and my hope is perished from the Lord,' he recalled
                    the providences of God in his behalf and triumphantly ex-
                    claimed, 'It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed,
                    because His compassions fail not. They are new every morning:
                    great is Thy faithfulness.' Lamentations 3:18, 22, 23."—Proph-
                    ets and Kings, p. 421.

                      What events did Daniel and John the revelator predict for
                    the Middle Ages? Dan. 7:25; Rev. 13:7.

                       Millions of loyal Christians were tortured and killed during
                    the Middle Ages at the hands of Rome. They met this fate
                    because of loyalty to God and His Word instead of accepting
                    the dogmas imposed by the apostate church. Religious leaders
                    induced civil power to destroy all who resisted their authority.
                       "The history of God's people during the ages of darkness that
                    followed upon Rome's supremacy is written in heaven, but
                    they have little place in human records. Few traces of their
                    existence can be found, except in the accusations of their
                    persecutors."—The Great Controversy, p. 61.
                       "They [witnesses for God] were branded as heretics, their
                    motives impugned, their characters maligned, their writings
                    suppressed, misrepresented, or mutilated. Yet they stood firm,
                    and from age to age maintained their faith in its purity, as a
                    sacred heritage for the generations to come."—The Great Con-

            FUTURE
       PERSECUTION        There are three periods when this scripture will be especially
                       fulfilled: (1) The days in which we are living. (2) From the estab-
                       lishment of the federal Sunday law in the United States to the
                       end of probation. In this epoch the image of the beast will be
                       imposed. (3) The time of trouble, after the close of probation,
                       when the death decree will be issued.

                         What does Revelation 13:12, 16 say about the days of the
                       second period, after the Sunday law?
                          When the lamblike beast—the United States—will exercise
                       all the power of the first beast—Rome—then the children of God
                       will begin to experience great trouble. The state, at the request
                       of the churches, will impose economic restrictions and severe
                       penalties on those who refuse to disobey God.
                          "All who refuse compliance [to the observance of the false
                       sabbath] will be visited with civil penalties. . . .
                             .. Whoever shall trample upon God's law to obey a human
                       enactment receives the mark of the beast. . . .
                          "But not one is made to suffer the wrath of God [of Rev. 14:9,
                       10] until the truth has been brought home to his mind and con-
                       science, and has been rejected.... The decree is not to be urged
                       upon the people blindly. Everyone is to have sufficient light to
                       make his decision intelligently.

                         For what act will a death decree be issued? Rev. 13:15.
                          This decree comes after the end of probation, during the
                       third and final period of the time of trouble. A definite date
                       will be fixed for its execution. Nevertheless, before that day the
                       wicked will afflict the Christians, in certain areas even trying to
                       kill them. But the protection of God will be over them during
                       the time of the plagues.
                          On the very night when the opposers of the faithful plan a
                       mass killing of all Sabbath keepers, the sun will shine at mid-
                       night; and the final liberation will come. (See The Great Con-
                       troversy, pp. 635, 636.)

THINK IT THROUGH         Do I need to have a naturally courageous disposition in
                       order to be able to resist the powers of darkness?
                         Peter, by his betrayal, revealed a cowardly trait. Later on,
                       though, he stood before the Sanhedrin. At the moment when he
                       knew that such a statement could mean his death, he boldly
                       declared: "We ought to obey God rather than men" (Acts 5:29).
                         What caused this complete change? How long did it take for

          Part 4   What did Jesus teach about persecution for righteousness'
   GOD'S WAY OF sake?
   DEALING WITH
    PERSECUTION    "Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness'
                 sake: for their's is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are ye,
                 when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say
                 all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. Rejoice,
                 and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven:
                 for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you"
                 (Matt. 5:10-12).

                     "Under the fiercest persecution these witnesses for Jesus
                   [Christians of Nero's time] kept their faith unsullied. Though
                   deprived of every comfort, shut away from the light of the sun,
                   making their home in the dark but friendly bosom of the earth,
                   they uttered no complaint. . . .
                     ...Looking upward by faith, they saw Christ and angels lean-
                   ing over the battlements of heaven, gazing upon them with the
                   deepest interest and regarding their steadfastness with
                   approval. A voice came down to them from the throne of God:
                   'Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.'
                   Revelation 2:10."—The Great Controversy, p. 41.

                     What promises of God to His ancient people continue to
                   support suffering people today? Isa. 43:2.

                     "Though enemies may thrust them into prison, yet dungeon
                   walls cannot cut off the communication between their souls
                   and Christ. One who sees their every weakness, who is ac-
                   quainted with every trial, is above all earthly powers; and angels
                   will come to them in lonely cells, bringing light and peace from
                   heaven."—The Great Controversy, p. 627.

                     What assurance does Paul give to tempted believers? 1 Cor.
                   10:13.

                     What a beautiful thought, that God prevents every trial from
                   exceeding what we can endure and delivers us at the appro-
                   priate moment!

THINK IT THROUGH     "What was the strength of those who in the past have suf-
                   fered persecution for Christ's sake? It was union with God,
                   union with the Holy Spirit, union with Christ. Reproach and
                   persecution have separated many from earthly friends, but
                   never from the love of Christ. Never is the tempest-tried soul
                   more dearly loved by his Saviour than when he is suffering

              Part 5     Describe the symbolic setting in which John saw the
         VICTORY IN    victors.
       PERSECUTION
                         "I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them
                       that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image,
                       and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on
                       the sea of glass, having the harps of God" (Rev. 15:2).
                         These victors "sing the song of Moses the servant of God,
                       and the song of the Lamb" (verse 3). The song of Moses was a
                       song of victory.
                         In addition to these who obtained the victory over the beast
                       and its image Revelation also describes another "great multi-
                       tude which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds,
                       and people, and tongues." They also stand "before the throne,
                       and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in
                       their hands" (Rev. 7:9, 10). These also proclaim the victory
                       and salvation of God. They belong to all ages.
                         This vision of a great throng of triumphant people gives us
                       assurance that victory over the world is possible and that we can
                       be victors if only we avail ourselves of the means of grace
                       provided in Jesus.

                        What can we learn from the experience of the first Christian
                       martyr? Acts 7:55-60.
                          "Acting more like beasts of prey than human beings, they
                       rushed upon Stephen, gnashing their teeth. In the cruel faces
                       about him the prisoner read his fate; but he did not waver. For
                       him the fear of death was gone. For him the enraged priests
                       and the excited mob had no terror. The scene before him faded
                       from his vision. To him the gates of heaven were ajar, and, look-
                       ing in, he saw the glory of the courts of God, and Christ, as if
                       just risen from His throne, standing ready to sustain His servant.
                       In words of triumph Stephen exclaimed, 'Behold, I see the heav-
                       ens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of
                       God.' "—The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 100, 101.
                          Victory consists in faithfulness to Christ.

THINK IT THROUGH         Why did God permit the martyrdom of Stephen?
                          "The martyrdom of Stephen made a deep impression upon
                       all who witnessed it. The memory of the signet of God upon
                       his face; his words, which touched the very souls of those who
                       heard them, remained in the minds of the beholders, and testi-
                       fied to the truth of that which he had proclaimed. His death
                       was a sore trial to the church, but it resulted in the conviction
                       of Saul, who could not efface from his memory the faith and
                       constancy of the martyr, and the glory that had rested on his

                                                                           April 20

           Part 6    What did John say was the means of victory for those who
  OUR ASSURANCE     would experience the wrath of the dragon?
       IN CHRIST
                      "They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the
                    word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the
                    death" (Rev. 12:11).

                       A. "The blood of the Lamb." This expression leads our eyes
                    to the great scene of victory on Golgotha. When our Saviour
                    pronounced on the cross—at the moment of His death—the
                    words, "It is finished," He sealed the plan of salvation by crush-
                    ing the head of that old serpent, Satan, obtaining the most
                    glorious victory of all ages.
                       From then on, every human being could look to the cross of
                    Jesus. By faith he could appropriate for himself the same vic-
                    tory: victory over temptation and sin, victory in the midst of
                    persecution and death.
                       The spilled blood of Jesus that represents His final victory
                    has power. His death has power to atone for every sin and power
                    for us to be victorious—in His name—over our weaknesses and
                    our temptations. This includes power to remain faithful under
                    the most extreme persecutions, even the threat of death.
                       B. "The word of their testimony." This is the second part
                     of the secret of victory. Stephen was not content with remaining
                    faithful to Jesus till his death; he continued to testify with his
                    lips on behalf of his Master till the last moment.
                       This is the way in which the world has to receive the saving
                     knowledge of the power of Jesus—the words of our testimony.
                    And when we utter our public testimony—whether in a personal
                     conversation, in the privacy of a home or in a meeting, orally
                     or in writing—that testimony strengthens our own faith. It is
                    also used by the Holy Spirit to impress those who hear. No one
                     can measure the far-reaching influence or the deep and per-
                     manent impression of such a human testimony. It may cause a
                     person or a group of persons to decide for Christ at a time and
                     a place far removed from the original testimony.

THINK IT THROUGH      How can I avail myself of the power of His blood?

                      How can I take better advantage of my social and profes-
                    sional contacts with others in order to witness for Christ with

           Part 1  What is the first power symbolized by the dragon? Rev.
      THE DRAGON 12:9.

                     Satan himself is the first power represented by the dragon, as
                   we see in verse 9. Satan began the war against God right in
                   heaven. Later, on earth he began using different agencies. In
                   this section we will review some of the other powers employed
                   by Satan, the dragon.

                     What actions of the dragon in Revelation 12:3, 4 help to
                   identify an earthly power represented by the dragon? What is
                   this second power?

                      The dragon with seven heads and ten horns also represents
                   the Roman Empire. The seven heads or powers are the great
                   world empires which fought against God, moved by Satan. But
                   the prophet, using a figure of speech in which the whole stands
                   for a part (synecdoche), refers here specifically to the Roman
                   Empire. The dragon had also ten horns, which refer to the terri-
                   tory of Rome, which was fragmented into ten nations. In the
                   first century this power, through Herod, stood before the
                   woman (the church) to devour her Child. He ordered the murder
                   of all the children in Bethlehem up to two years of age in an
                   effort to destroy Jesus.

                     What features in Revelation 12:6, 14 identify a third power
                   symbolized by the dragon? What is this third power?

                      This is "Christian" Rome in the Middle Ages. The woman—
                   the small, loyal church of God—was persecuted during the pro-
                   phetic period of the 1260 years—three and a half prophetic
                   years or 42 months. (See Rev. 12:6; Dan. 7:25; Rev. 13:5.)
                     The fourth stage of persecution by the dragon. (See Rev.
                   12:17.) There will be a renewal of persecution against God's
                   people by the dragon. The earthly power that he will use for
                   this attack is presented in Revelation 13.

THINK IT THROUGH     What is the effective defense against the dragon who seeks
                   to attack us, not only by open persecution but by temptations
                   and provocations?

                     "Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power
                   of his might. Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be
                   able to stand against the wiles of the devil" (Eph. 6:10, 11).
                     Study the different parts of this armor and discover how
                   every part of it points to Christ as the source of our strength
                   and the secret of our victory.

          Part 2     What were the features of the first beast of chapter 13?
      THE FIRST
       BEAST OF      "I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up
  REVELATION 13    out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon
                   his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blas-
                   phemy" (Rev. 13:1).

                      The first ten verses of Revelation 13 present a history more
                   or less parallel to the one described in Revelation 12. But while
                   in the former chapter the events are seen from a political point
                   of view, here in chapter 13 we witness the same persecution
                   and affliction of the people of God from a religious standpoint.
                      This beast with its seven heads or powers may well represent
                   the succession of the seven great world powers: Egypt, Assyria,
                   Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, pagan Rome, and papal Rome.
                   Here also the ten horns identify the European territory into
                   which Rome was divided. Papal Rome would exercise her
                   power especially in Europe.
                      The parallel with the prophetic vision of Daniel 7 is estab-
                   lished by verse 2, where we see a beast composed of the parts
                   of three of the four beasts described by Daniel. These beasts
                   symbolized world empires.

                     What other specifications help identify this first beast? Rev.
                   13:5-7.
                      Both here and in Daniel 7:21, 25 it is easy to detect the same
                   great features that depict the papal power: (1) blasphemies,
                   assuming titles and powers that belong only to God; (2) war
                   against the saints; (3) a period of religiopolitical supremacy
                   of 42 prophetic months, equivalent to a literal 1260 years (A.D.
                   538-1798).
                      "This symbol, as most Protestants have believed, represents
                   the papacy, which succeeded to the power and seat and author-
                   ity once held by the ancient Roman empire.... This prophecy,
                   which is nearly identical with the description of the little horn of
                   Daniel 7, unquestionably points to the papacy."—The Great
                   Controversy, p. 439.

                     What happened to one of the heads of the first beast? Rev.
                   13:3.
                     The death wound was the loss of the political power and
                   supremacy of the papacy, leading up to 1798, when the French
                   General Berthier took the pope prisoner. But the healing pro-
                   cess began when Mussolini, in 1929, restored to the pope some
                   of the territories which had been taken from the papacy.

THINK IT THROUGH     Would you think that God will require of us an even stronger
                   testimony than from the medieval Christians? Why?

                       as did the other beasts. Since the sea represents peoples, the

                          The United States has fulfilled—and continues to fulfill—the
                       role of a lamblike beast. To its shores have come persecuted
                       men and women from all parts of the world to seek refuge.
                       But according to prophecy a sad change will come. Review the
                       following points:
                          (1) It will speak as a dragon, and a dragon is a persecuting
                       power (v. 11). (2) It exercises all the power of the sea beast
                       (Rome); it uses the same forceful methods to impose religious
                       practices (v. 12). (3) It causes everybody to worship the sea
                       beast (v. 12). (4) It says to the inhabitants of the earth that they
                       should make an image to the sea beast. If the sea beast (Rome)
                       is a church united to a state that persecutes people, an image
                       should be something similar—apostate Protestantism using
                       the civil power of the state to enforce religion (v. 14). (5) It
                       gives life to the image of the beast; the state will support the
                       dictates of apostate Christianity (v. 15). (6) It causes all to re-
                       ceive the mark of the beast; it imposes Sunday observance
                       (v. 16). (7) It causes conditions so that no one can buy or sell ex-
                       cept the one who has the mark; it abolishes the most elemental
                       freedoms; it suspends some individual rights (v. 16). (8) It
                       pronounces a death decree against all who do not worship
                       Rome (v. 15).

          Part 4     What are the results of not receiving the mark of the beast?
    THE MARK OF
      THE BEAST      "He [the lamblike beast—the United States] causeth all,
                   both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive
                   a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: and that no
                   man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name
                   of the beast [Rome], or the number of his name" (Rev. 13:
                   16, 17).
                     What is the mark of the beast?
                      "Mark. Gr. charagma, 'an impress,' a stamp,' a mark.' This
                   is evidently some badge of loyalty to the beast, some special
                   feature that denotes that the one displaying such a mark wor-
                   ships the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed (v. 8).
                   Adventist interpreters understand this mark to be not a literal
                   brand but some sign of allegiance that identifies the bearer as
                   loyal to the power represented by the beast. The controversy at
                   that time will center on the law of God, and particularly on the
                   fourth command (see on ch. 14:12). Hence the observance of
                   Sunday will constitute such a sign, but only at the time when the
                   beast's power will be revived and Sunday observance becomes
                   a matter of compliance with civil law. Adventists hold that simul-
                   taneously the third angel's message will warn against the recep-
                   tion of the mark (ch. 14:9-11). This message, swelling into a
                   loud cry (ch. 18:1-4), will enlighten men as to the issues in-
                   volved. When the issues are thus clearly before them, and men
                   nevertheless choose •to support an institution of the beast,
                   knowing it to be in direct opposition to the command of God,
                   they thereby show their allegiance to the power and receive
                   the mark of the beast."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 7,
                   p. 822.
                      "In the issue of the contest all Christendom will be divided
                   into two great classes—those who keep the commandments of
                   God and the faith of Jesus, and those who worship the beast
                   and his image and receive his mark."—The Great Controversy,
                   p. 450.
                      "The warfare against God's law, which was begun in heaven,
                   will be continued until the end of time. Every man will be
                   tested. Obedience or disobedience is the-question to be de-

                   be drawn."—The Desire of Ages, p. 763.
                      The establishment of a national Sunday law in the U.S. will
                   be followed by similar laws throughout the world.

              Part 5      What triple union does Revelation foretell?
         THE TRIPLE
             UNION       "I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth
                       of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the
                       mouth of the false prophet" (Rev. 16:13).

                          Identification of the three confederated powers: (1) The
                       dragon is in essence Satan himself. In Revelation 12 the dragon
                        also represents the Roman Empire acting under the leadership
                        of the devil. In chapter 16 the dragon is doubtless Satan operat-
                        ing through spiritualism, used by Satan to promote his aims and
                        to unite the other powers, since from the mouth of the three—
                        the dragon, the beast, and the false prophet—there came out
                        spirits of devils (Rev. 16:14). (2) The beast is Rome, the papacy,
                        the first beast of Revelation 13. (3) The false prophet is the same
                        power as "the image of the beast" of Revelation 13—the apos-
                       tate and confederate Protestantism.
                          "When Protestantism shall stretch her hand across the gulf to
                       grasp the hand of the Roman power, when she shall reach over
                       the abyss to clasp hands with spiritualism, when, under the
                       influence of this threefold union, our country [the U.S.] shall
                       repudiate every principle of its Constitution as a Protestant and
                       republican government, and shall make provision for the propa-
                       gation of papal falsehoods and delusions, then we may know
                       that the time has come for the marvelous working of Satan and
                       that the end is near."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 451.
                          "Through the two great errors, the immortality of the soul
                       and Sunday sacredness, Satan will bring the people under his
                       deceptions. While the former lays the foundation of spiritual-
                       ism, the latter creates a bond of sympathy with Rome. The
                       Protestants of the United States will be foremost in stretching
                       their hands across the gulf to grasp the hand of spiritualism;
                       they will reach over the abyss to clasp hands with the Roman

                   suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;

                   fulness, in watching often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings
                   often, in cold and nakedness" (2 Cor. 11:24-27).

                      The account of these tribulations of Paul provides encour-
                   agement to the children of God who will have to suffer for their
                   dear Master.
                      Never did Paul show a rebellious attitude against God or a
                   bitter spirit; but he counted it as a privilege to suffer for the
                   sake of the truth. He always kept his eyes fixed on Jesus, the
                   Author and Finisher of his faith. This promise of God kept
                   ringing in his ears, "My grace is sufficient for thee," and the
                   apostle went ahead as a conqueror, always with a triumphant
                   mood.

                     In spite of all these vicissitudes, how did Paul view his
                   ministry? What did he consider to be the secret of success?

                         Here inspiration opens before us a dark episode in the long
                       controversy between good and evil, namely, the time of trouble.
                       "At that time"—that is to say, at the time of the end of human
                       history—the last scenes of Daniel 11 are occurring. Then
                       "Michael ... the great prince [Jesus Christ; see Jude 9; 1 Thess.
                       4:16; John 5:25; Rev. 12:17] which standeth for the children of
                       thy people," leaves His intercessory duties on behalf of the chil-
                       dren of God. He "stands up" and arises to deliver His people
                       because "there shall be a time of trouble."
                         Although this trouble is the most severe that has happened in
                       human history, the promise is that "at that time thy people shall
                       be delivered."

                          What warning and promise made to Judah will also be ful-
                       filled in the time of trouble? Jer. 30:7.
                          "When He [Christ] leaves the sanctuary, darkness covers
                       the inhabitants of the earth. In that fearful time the righteous
                       must live in the sight of a holy God without an intercessor. The
                       restraint that has been upon the wicked is removed, and Satan
                       has entire control of the finally impenitent. God's long-suffering
                       has ended. The world has rejected His mercy, despised His love,
                       and trampled upon His law. The wicked have passed the bound-
                       ary of their probation; the Spirit of God, persistently resisted,
                       has been at last withdrawn. Unsheltered by divine grace, they
                       have no protection from the wicked one. Satan will then plunge
                       the inhabitants of the earth into one great, final trouble. As
                       the angels of God cease to hold in check the fierce winds of
                       human passion, all the elements of strife will be let loose. The
                       whole world will be involved in ruin more terrible than that
                       which came upon Jerusalem of old."—The Great Controversy,
                       p. 614.

THINK IT THROUGH         Should we worry about events in the future? If Jesus is
                       sufficient to save us now, will He not prove to be sufficient for
                       our needs then?
                          "We are standing on the threshold of the crisis of the ages.
                       . . . The angel of mercy cannot remain much longer to shelter
                       the impenitent."—Prophets and Kings, p. 278.

The Time of Trouble-1           LESSON 5                                ❑ Monday
                                                                          April 30

            Part 2    What decree fixes human destinies?
         THE TIME:
        BEGINNING     "He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is
          AND END filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be
                   righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still" (Rev.
                   22:11).

                        "An angel returning from the earth announces that his work
                     is done; the final test has been brought upon the world, and all
                     who have proved themselves loyal to the divine precepts have
                     received 'the seal of the living God.' Then Jesus ceases His
                     intercession in the sanctuary above. He lifts His hands and with
                     a loud voice says, 'It is done;' and all the angelic host lay off
                     their crowns as He makes the solemn announcement: 'He that
                     is unjust, let him be unjust still.' . . Every case has been
                     decided for life or death."—The Great Controversy, p. 613.
                        When does the time of trouble end?
                        Although no one knows exactly what the duration of the time
                     of trouble will be, we infer that it will be short. And at the
                     appointed time the deliverance will come just shortly before
                     the actual appearance of Jesus.
                        Said the servant of the Lord: "Satan's host and wicked men
                     will surround them [the saints], and exult over them, because
                     there will seem to be no way of escape for them. But in the midst
                     of their revelry and triumph, there is heard peal upon peal of
                     the loudest thunder. The heavens have gathered blackness, and
                     are only illuminated by the blazing light and terrible glory from
                     heaven, as God utters His voice from His holy habitation.
                        "The foundations of the earth shake; buildings totter and fall
                      with a terrible crash. The sea boils like a pot, and the whole
                     earth is in terrible commotion. The captivity of the righteous is
                     turned, and with sweet and solemn whisperings they say to one
                      another: 'We are delivered. It is the voice of God.' "—Testi-
                     monies, vol. 1, p. 354.

THINK IT THROUGH       "The devil is come down unto you, having great wrath,
                     because he knoweth that he hath but a short time" (Rev.
                     12:12).

                       Commenting on this, Ellen White wrote: "Fearful are the
                     scenes which call forth this exclamation from the heavenly
                     voice. The wrath of Satan increases as his.time grows short,
                     and his work of deceit and destruction will reach its culmination
                     in the time of trouble."—The Great Controversy, p. 623.

           Part 3   Analyze the experience of Jacob at Padan-aram. Gen.
         JACOB'S 32:24-29.
        DRAMATIC
      EXPERIENCE    "Jacob's experience during that night of wrestling and an-
                  guish represents the trial through which the people of God must
                  pass just before Christ's second coming."—Patriarchs and
                  Prophets, p. 201.

                     To what portion of the time of trouble at large does the ex-
                   pression "the time of Jacob's trouble" especially apply?

                      "They [the wicked] thought that we [the righteous] had
                   brought the judgments of God upon them, and that if they could
                   rid the earth of us, the plagues would be stayed. A decree
                   went forth to slay the saints, which caused them to cry day and
                   night for deliverance. This was the time of Jacob's trouble.
                   Then all the saints cried out with anguish of spirit, and were
                   delivered by the voice of God."—Early Writings, pp. 36, 37.
                      From this paragraph we may draw two conclusions: (1) the
                   "time of Jacob's trouble" embraces the period which extends
                   from the announcement of the death decree to the liberation;
                   (2) the period begins after the plagues have started to fall.

                     What are the two characteristics of the night of Jacob's
                   wrestling that apply to the time of trouble? Read today's text
                   again.

                      1. Jacob experienced anguish because of the material situa-
                   tion which confronted him. His brother was coming against him
                   with 400 armed men, apparently with intentions of revenge. Per-
                   secution is symbolized here.
                      2. Jacob felt intense mental anguish in his struggle with God
                   in prayer because he was not sure his sins had been forgiven.

THINK IT THROUGH     The only road to real revival, reformation, and victory is
                   persevering and fervent, secret prayer. Are you entering into
                   this experience? (See Selected Messages, bk. 1, p. 344.)

                     While Jacob was humiliating his soul before God and crying
                   for mercy and surety of forgiveness, the Angel appeared. Deep
                   into the night the patriarch continued to wrestle physically
                   for his life. But as soon as he discovered that this stranger
                   was the Angel of God, he clung to Him with persevering faith
                   claiming His blessing; and he was blessed with peace and
                   assurance. By a fervent experience of secret prayer, confession,
                   and commitment the forgiveness was assured, the victory was
                   won, and his character as well as his name was changed.

The Time of Trouble-1        LESSON 5                             ❑ Wednesday
                                                                        May 2

         Part 4   What Old Testament text gives symbolic meaning to
    MENTAL AND Jacob's experience?
      PHYSICAL
      ANGUISH     "Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even
                the time of Jacob's trouble; but he shall be saved out of it"
                (Jer. 30:7).

                      Jacob, during his night of trouble, experienced the physical
                   anguish of persecution and the mental anguish of uncertainty
                   concerning the forgiveness of his sins. The saints will also
                   suffer these two kinds of trouble.
                      1. Persecution. "As the decree issued by the various rulers
                   of Christendom against the commandment keepers shall with-
                   draw the protection of government and abandon them to those
                   who desire their destruction, the people of God will flee from the
                   cities and villages and associate together in companies, dwell-
                   ing in the most desolate and solitary places. Many will find
                   refuge in the strongholds of the mountains. Like the Christians
                   of the Piedmont valleys, they will make the high places of
                   the earth their sanctuaries and will thank God for 'the munitions
                   of rocks.' Isaiah 33:16. But many of all nations and of all classes,
                   high and low, rich and poor, black and white, will be cast into
                   the most unjust and cruel bondage. The beloved of God pass
                   weary days, bound in chains, shut in by prison bars, sentenced
                   to be slain, some apparently left to die of starvation in dark and
                   loathsome dungeons."—The Great Controversy, p. 626.
                       We will see in the next lesson that in all of this trouble
                   every child of God will be under divine protection. His life will
                   be preserved and his basic needs satisfied until the deliverance.
                       2. Mental anguish. "Though God's people will be surrounded
                   by enemies who are bent upon their destruction, yet the anguish
                   which they suffer is not a dread of persecution for the truth's
                   sake; they fear that every sin has not been repented of, and that
                   through some fault in themselves they will fail to realize the ful-
                   fillment of the Saviour's promise. . . .
                       ". . . Their faith does not fail because their prayers are not
                   immediately answered. Though suffering the keenest anxiety,
                   terror, and distress, they do not cease their intercessions. They
                    lay hold of the strength of God as Jacob laid hold of the Angel."
                   —The Great Controversy, pp. 619, 620.
                       But like Jacob, they have confessed their sins and soon re-
                    cover their peace and joy in the Lord.

THINK IT THROUGH      What do we need to do now, while probationary time
                   lingers, in order to be finally liberated in that day of spiritual
                   anxiety? (Read The Great Controversy, p. 620.)

The Time of Trouble-1            LESSON 5                               ❑ Thursday
                                                                            May 3

             Part 5  In the light of Malachi 3:2, 3, what is the purpose of God in
           PURPOSE permitting His people to experience trouble and distress?

                         "Who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand
                      when he appeareth? for he is like a refiner's fire, and like
                      fullers' soap: and he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver:
                      and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold
                      and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in
                      righteousness" (Mal. 3:2, 3).

                        The spirit of prophecy applies the figures from this passage
                     to the experience of God's people in the time of trouble.
                        "The assaults of Satan are fierce and determined, his delu-
                     sions are terrible; but the Lord's eye is upon His people, and His
                     ear listens to their cries. Their affliction is great, the flames
                     of the furnace seem about to consume them; but the Refiner will
                     bring them forth as gold tried in the fire. God's love for His
                     children during the period of their severest trial is as strong and
                     tender as in the days of their sunniest prosperity; but it is need-
                     ful for them to be placed in the furnace of fire; their earthliness
                     must be consumed, that the image of Christ may be perfectly
                     reflected."—The Great Controversy, p. 621.
                        At the time of these experiences the saints have already been
                     sealed. Still they need to continue to grow and be perfected
                     through patience and suffering. Their faith needs to become
                     stronger, their character more similar to that of the great Model.
                        "The people of God must drink of the cup and be baptized
                     with the baptism. The very delay, so painful to them, is the best
                     answer to their petitions. As they endeavor to wait trustingly
                     for the Lord to work they are led to exercise faith, hope, and
                     patience, which have been too little exercised during their reli-
                     gious experience."—The Great Controversy, pp. 630, 631.

THINK IT THROUGH       What relation is there between tribulations in our life now
                     and the severest of all afflictions, the time of trouble?

                        "Those who exercise but little faith now, are in the greatest
                     danger of falling under the power of satanic delusions and the
                     decree to compel the conscience. And even if they endure the
                     test they will be plunged into deeper distress and anguish in the
                     time of trouble, because they have never made it a habit to trust
                     in God. The lessons of faith which they have neglected they will
                     be forced to learn under a terrible pressure of discourage-
                     ment."—The Great Controversy, p. 622.

                   and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.
                   . . . Be zealous therefore, and repent" (Rev. 3:18, 19).

                      Gold: faith and love, the fruits of the Spirit.
                     White raiment: the imputed righteousness of Christ, or for-
                   giveness and cleansing from sin; and the imparted righteous-
                   ness of Christ, His pure and perfect character reproduced in us
                   by faith.
                      Eyesalve: wisdom and insight in order to recognize sin under
                   any disguise. In other words, a sensitive conscience led by
                   the Holy Spirit. (See Selected Messages, bk. 1, p. 358, on above
                   interpretations.)
                      These three elements will finish the work of sealing our lives,
                   making us ready for the time of Jacob's trouble and for trans-
                   lation at Christ's coming.
                      "The season of distress before God's people will call for
                   a faith that will not falter. His children must make it manifest
                   that He is the only object of their worship, and that no consider-
                   ation, not even that of life itself, can induce them to make the
                   least concession to false worship. To the loyal heart the com-
                   mands of sinful, finite men will sink into insignificance beside
                   the word of the eternal God. Truth will be obeyed though the
                   result be imprisonment or exile or death.
                      "As in the days of Shad rach, Meshach, and Abednego, so in
                   the closing period of earth's history the Lord will work mightily
                   in behalf of those who stand steadfastly for the right. He who
                   walked with the Hebrew worthies in the fiery furnace will be
                    with His followers wherever they are. His abiding presence will
                    comfort and sustain. In the midst of the time of trouble—trouble
                    such as has not been since therewas a nation—His chosen ones
                    will stand unmoved. Satan with all the hosts of evil cannot
                    destroy the weakest of God's saints. Angels that excel in
                    strength will protect them, and in their behalf Jehovah will
                    reveal Himself as a 'God of gods,' able to save to the uttermost
                    those who have put their trust in Him."—Prophets and Kings,
                    pp. 512, 513.

THINK IT THROUGH     Christ, His righteousness, and the Holy Spirit—the remedies
                   offered by Jesus to the Laodiceans—are the only answer to
                   our greatest need today as children of God. Am I buying daily
                   from the heavenly Physician these effective medicines? How
                   do I go about "buying" them?

   "Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed
is he that watcheth, and keepeth
his garments, lest he walk naked, and
they see his shame" (Rev. 16:15).



   These inspired words apply to the
close of the investigative judgment
and the period of grace. Both will
terminate at an unexpected time. To
this special moment the prophecy of
Daniel 12:1 also refers when it says,
"There shall be a time of trouble,
such as never was." Also Revelation
22:11 points to this specific hour,
since when it comes, "he that is
unjust" continues to be unjust, and
"he that is righteous" continues to
be righteous.
    The most important point about the
time of trouble is not to understand
completely all the facts; but rather,
to have a firm, true faith in Jesus
that will enable us to pass through
that ominous time safely. Those who
have a faith in Jesus that leads them
to obey Him will be protected fully
 from the seven last plagues, sealed
 by the seal of the living God for
 eternal salvation and covered
 completely by the beautiful and
 perfect garment of the righteousness
 of Christ.
    The only key to victory is to have
 a heart cleansed by the blood of            DAILY HIGHLIGHTS
 Jesus. This lesson seeks to confront        1. The Seven Last Plagues
 us with our vital need of acquiring            (Revelation 16)
 the personal Christian experience of        2. Protection and Care of God
 one whose life "is hid with Christ in          (Ps. 91:1, 2, 15)

 affect him or change his glorious              Probation (Rev. 15:8; 8:5)
  destination.                               4. Unexpectedness of the Time
    This is even more important in              (Rev. 16:15)
 view of the fact that the end of            5. The Sealed
  probation is very near, and it will come      (Eze. 14:20)
  unexpectedly, even to the children of      6. Key to Success

               Part 1     Read Revelation 16.
          THE SEVEN
       LAST PLAGUES       What is the main point of each one of the seven plagues?

                           These last plagues are similar in nature to the plagues of
                        Egypt but are much more terrible and destructive. They fall on
                         the wicked "just before the final deliverance of God's people.
                        . . . Terrible as these inflictions are, God's justice stands fully
                         vindicated. The angel of God declares: 'Thou art righteous, 0
                        Lord, ... because Thou hast judged thus. For they have shed the
                        blood of saints and prophets, and Thou hast given them blood
                         to drink; for they are worthy.' Revelation 16:2-6."—The Great
                        Controversy, p. 628.
                           The falling of the plagues takes place during the time when
                        the temple in heaven is pictured as closed and filled with smoke.
                        (See Rev. 15:8.) "It was impossible for the plagues to be poured
                        out while Jesus officiated in the sanctuary; but as His work there
                        is finished, and His intercession closes, there is nothing to stay
                        the wrath of God, and it breaks with fury upon the shelterless
                        head of the guilty sinner, who has slighted salvation and hated
                        reproof."—Early Writings, p. 280.
                           "These plagues are not universal, or the inhabitants of the
                        earth would be wholly cut off. Yet they will be the most awful
                        scourges that have ever been known to mortals. All the judg-
                        ments upon men, prior to the close of probation, have been
                        mingled with mercy. The pleading blood of Christ has shielded
                        the sinner from receiving the full measure of his guilt; but in the
                        final judgment wrath is poured out unmixed with mercy."—The
                        Great Controversy, pp. 628, 629.
                           The duration will be brief. If the word "day" mentioned in
                        Revelation 18:8 is prophetic time (Eze. 4:6), it may be reasoned
                        that the plagues will last for one year. Except for this passage,
                        neither the Bible nor the spirit of prophecy makes any reference
                        to the length of the period. The S.D.A. Bible Commentary
                        suggests that the words of the original "stress suddenness and
                        unexpectedness rather than duration."—Volume 7, p. 863.

THINK IT THROUGH          "A book has been given us to guide our feet through the
                        perils of this dark world to heaven. It tells us how we can
                        escape the wrath of God, and also tells of the sufferings of
                        Christ for us, the great sacrifice that has been made that we
                        might be saved and enjoy the presence of God forever.... The
                        word of God tells us how we may become perfect Christians
                        and escape the seven last plagues."—Testimonies, vol. 1,

         Part 2   "He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall
     PROTECTION abide under the shadow of the Almighty. I will say of the Lord,
       AND CARE He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust."
        OF GOD    "He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with
                him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him" (Ps. 91:1, 2,
                15).

                      "The people of God will not be free from suffering; but while
                    persecuted and distressed, while they endure privation and
                    suffer for want of food, they will not be left to perish. That God
                    who cared for Elijah will not pass by one of His self-sacrificing
                    children. He who numbers the hairs of their head will care for
                    them, and in time of famine they shall be satisfied."—The Great
                    Controversy, p. 629.

                      What promises are given to those who must endure the
                    seven last plagues? Isa. 33:16; Ps. 37:19.

                      "By this promise [Isa. 33:16] the children of God will live.
                    When the earth shall be wasted with famine, they shall be fed.
                    [Ps. 37:19 quoted.] To that time of distress the prophet Habak-
                    kuk looked forward, and his words express the faith of the
                    church: [Flab. 3:17, 18 quoted]."—The Desire of Ages, p. 122.
                      "While the wicked are dying from hunger and pestilence,
                    angels will shield the righteous and supply their wants. To him
                    that 'walketh righteously' is the promise: 'Bread shall be given
                    him; his waters shall be sure.' When the poor and needy seek
                    water, and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirst, I the
                    Lord will hear them, I the God of Israel will not forsake them.'
                    Isaiah 33:15, 16; 41:17."—The Great Controversy, p. 629.
                      The angels will minister to God's children during that time.
                      "In the time of trouble just before the coming of Christ, the
                    righteous will be preserved through the ministration of
                    heavenly angels; but there will be no security for the transgres-
                    sor of God's law. Angels cannot then protect those who are
                    disregarding one of the divine precepts."—Patriarchs and
                    Prophets, p. 256.

 THINK IT THROUGH     What do I need to do now in order to be protected by the holy
                    angels during the seven plagues? Does Revelation 18:4 have
                    any application to us as Seventh-day Adventists?

             Part 3    What is the meaning of the following biblical symbols?
          NO MORE
         MEDIATOR;     "The temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God,
          NO MORE and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the
         PROBATION temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were ful-
                    filled" (Rev. 15:8).
                       "The angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar,
                    and cast it into the earth: and there were voices, and thunder-
                    ings, and lightnings, and an earthquake" (Rev. 8:5).

                          Revelation 15:8 states that "no man was able to enter into the
                       temple." In other words, nobody will have access to the mercy
                       seat, because mediation has ceased. The censer which sym-
                       bolizes the mediatorial work of Jesus is represented as thrown
                       to the earth by an angel, signifying that the ministry of Christ has
                       ceased.
                          At the beginning of the time of trouble the decree of Revela-
                       tion 22:11 is announced in heaven.
                          "When He [Christ] leaves the sanctuary, darkness covers the
                       inhabitants of the earth. In that fearful time the righteous must
                       live in the sight of a holy God without an intercessor. . . . The
                       world has rejected His mercy, despised His love, and trampled
                       upon His law. The wicked have passed the boundary of their
                       probation; the Spirit of God, persistently resisted, has been at
                       last withdrawn."—The Great Controversy, p. 614.
                          Ellen White gives the following description of the end of the
                      time of grace:
                          "An angel returning from the earth announces that his [seal-
                       ing] work is done; the final test has been brought upon the
                      world, and all who have proved themselves loyal to the divine
                      precepts have received 'the seal of the living God.' Then Jesus
                       ceases His intercession in the sanctuary above. He lifts His
                      hands and with a loud voice says, 'It is done;' and all the angelic
                      host lay off their crowns as He makes the solemn announce-
                      ment: 'He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: ... and he that is
                      righteous, let him be righteous still....' Revelation 22:11. Every
                      case has been decided for life or death."—The Great Con-

                      we are not saved." Now is the time to prevent that awful
                      experience, when the opportunity is still ours.

          Part 4   What is the admonition of Jesus regarding readiness for the
 UNEXPECTEDNESS end of the time of grace?
    OF THE TIME
                   "Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and
                 keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his
                 shame" (Rev. 16:15).

                     It is always an unhappy experience to receive a very loved and
                   respected visitor at home without the necessary preparation.
                   We like to have everything in order—the house clean, the beds
                   made, the yard neat. We consider preparation for a human
                   visitor very important. How much more vital it is that we be ready
                   spiritually when the Lord leaves the sanctuary and takes off His
                   intercessory garment to put on His royal garb in preparation for
                   His coming back to earth.

                     What counsel did Christ give to the disciples about readi-
                   ness? Matt. 24:42, 44.

                     "Come when it may, the day of God will come unawares to the
                   ungodly. When life is going on in its unvarying round; when men
                   are absorbed in pleasure, in business, in traffic, in money-
                   making; when religious leaders are magnifying the world's
                   progress and enlightment, and the people are lulled in a false
                   security—then, as the midnight thief steals within the un-

                          In connection with this passage Ellen White remarks, "In that

                       The Great Controversy, p. 622.
                          The only thing that will count in that day will be the personal,
                        individual experience and spiritual preparation.

          Part 6  What is the only key to success in our hard conflict with the
         KEY TO enemy?
        SUCCESS
                  "They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb" (Rev. 12:11).

                       Christ and His sacrifice, Christ and the power of His spilled
                    'blood, is the only hope for us weak, sinful human creatures.
                     That blood does two things for us: (1) It allows us to have
                     forgiveness and complete cleansing from all sin; (2) it gives us
                     power to overcome sin and be sanctified. Only by unity with
                     Jesus, a personal contact with Him, maintained day after day
                     and moment after moment, will we be able to succeed.

                       What is the Christian to do with his sins? 1 John 1:7-9.

                      Sometimes there is a tendency for Christians to consider that
                    repentance, confession, and forgiveness are isolated acts that
                    happen at the beginning of the Christian life. It is not so. Rather,
                    they are a continual experience. As the soul has a closer contact
                    with Christ and His light illuminates the heart, the Christian
                    becomes progressively aware of selfishness and defects of
                    character. Under the work of the Holy Spirit he finds it always
                    necessary to avail himself of the imputed righteousness of
                    Christ.
                      But at the same time the Christian grows, and by the grace of
                    God through the work of the Holy Spirit he gains spiritual vic-
                    tories.

                       Read the following promises of victory over sin and of
                     sanctification. Jude 24; 2 Peter 1:14; Phil. 4:13.

                        "We have little idea of the strength that would be ours if we
                     would connect with the source of all strength. We fall into sin
                     again and again, and think it must always be so. We cling to our
                     infirmities as if they were something to be proud of. Christ tells
                     us that we must set our face as a flint if we would overcome.
                     He has borne our sins in His own body on the tree; and through
                     the power He has given us, we may resist the world, the flesh,
                     and the devil. Then let us not talk of our weakness and ineffi-
                     ciency, but of Christ and His strength."—Messages to Young

                     the conflict by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. And He came to
                     make us partakers of the divine nature. So long as we are
                     united to Him by faith, sin has no more dominion over us. God
                     reaches for the hand of faith in us to direct it to lay fast hold
                     upon the divinity of Christ, that we may attain to perfection of

   This week we begin to study one of
the most popular and subtle
deceptions that the enemy will use in
the last days. Spiritualism will be one
of the three big elements in the
ungodly confederacy that will make
the final, desperate attack against
God, the truth, and the church.
According to Revelation 16:13, 14 the
three ungodly powers are the dragon
(spiritualism and allied activities), the
beast (the papacy), and the false
prophet (the united Protestantism
that will apostatize).
   This power—spiritualism—will be
so deceptive as to trap, if possible,
the very elect. Only those who are
well-grounded in the Bible and who
have a living experience with God
will be able to stand this attack of
the devil.
   Spiritualism and the occult are so
varied, comprising so many activities,
organizations, and methods, that many
 careless children of God will be
misled, especially because these
 different aspects appear to have no
 relationship with each other.              DAILY HIGHLIGHTS

          ORIGIN OF    the story of the first deception.
       SPIRITUALISM
                         The Garden of Eden was the scene of the first great satanic
                       deception. The devil disguised himself as a beautiful serpent.
                       He began the dialogue by asking a misleading question. He
                       formulated the great lie of the ages—"Ye shall not surely die."
                       He made a false promise—"Ye shall be as gods." He tempted
                       Eve, showing her that the fruit was appetizing and good for
                       food, and made her believe that she would gain wisdom. As in
                       Eden, so also today it is deadly dangerous to put aside the clear
                       commandment of God and to dialogue with the evil forces of
                       darkness.

                         What are some of the names by which spiritualism was
                       known during Old Testament times? Deut. 18:10, 11.

                         Note two cases of spirit communication recorded in the
                       Bible in 1 Samuel 28 and 2 Kings 1:1-4.

                         In the story of Saul and the witch of Endor, the person whom
                       the woman saw could not have been Samuel. Samuel was dead
                       and "the dead know not anything" (Eccl. 9:5). Further, "a com-
                       munication from Samuel, speaking as a prophet, would indi-
                       rectly be a communication from God, and it is expressly stated
                       that the Lord refused to communicate with Saul (1 Sam.
                       28:6)."-S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 2, p. 587. This early
                       spiritualistic séance had all the characteristics of the modern
                       ones.

                         What is the character of Satan? John 8:44.

                          Tempting as the promises of spiritualism are, they all come
                       from the great liar and lead into final destruction. To resort to
                       spiritualism and the occult to find answers to the problems of
                       life, is to put oneself in the hands of Satan. His sole purpose is to
                       deceive in order to destroy body and soul.

                         What was the punishment for spiritualistic activities in Is-
                       rael? Lev. 20:6, 27.

THINK IT THROUGH         "Side by side with the preaching of the gospel, agencies are
                       at work which are but the medium of lying spirits. Many a man

          LATER corded in the New Testament: Luke 8:26-39; Acts 8:9; 13:8;
  MANIFESTATIONS 16:16-18.

                      "The fact that men have been possessed with demons, is
                   clearly stated in the New Testament. The persons thus afflicted
                   were not merely suffering with disease from natural causes.
                   Christ had perfect understanding of that with which He was
                   dealing, and He recognized the direct presence and agency of
                   evil spirits."—The Great Controversy, p. 514.
                      Where and when did modern spiritualism begin?
                      During the month of March in 1848 the peaceful village of
                   Hydesville, New York, was disturbed by strange happenings in
                   the home of the Fox family. As a result of responding to noises
                   and rappings of undetermined origin, the two daughters of the
                   family became mediums. Soon the practice of spiritualism in its
                   new form spread like an epidemic over the United States, then
                   to England and to the rest of Europe and the Americas.
                      Spiritualism has gone, since 1848, through a remarkable
                   evolution in its forms. It has accommodated its methods to the
                   nature and culture of the people. Today a wide variety of forms
                   under very different names coexist in our world.
                      There are the primitive forms that prevail in the pagan coun-
                   tries. There are also the magic and sorcery that appeal to the
                   uneducated people, not only of primitive cultures, but also of
                   some more sophisticated countries. There is, too, the spiritual-
                   ism practiced among higher classes of society, within beauti-
                   ful and luxurious halls. Then there is the religious kind of spiri-
                   tualism, with meetings in which prayers are offered and hymns
                   are sung. Some kinds of speaking in tongues and healing
                   meetings are spiritualistic. On the other hand, spiritualism has
                   appeared under a scientific label in the universities under the
                   name "parapsychology." Also astrology and fortune-telling
                   have the same origin. Some of the phenomena that appear in
                   the deeper level of hypnotism may be devil-produced. New
                   manifestations of spiritualism may appear from time to time.

              Part 3      Against what spiritual forces does Paul warn?
           WHO THE
        SPIRITS ARE       "Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to
                       stand against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against
                       flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers,
                       against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against
                       spiritual wickedness in high places" (Eph. 6:11, 12).

                         The rebel angels who followed Lucifer in his war against God,
                       and who are the spiritual evil forces causing all the strange
                       manifestations of spiritualism, were expelled from heaven
                       along with their captain, Satan. But they still keep many of their
                       former characteristics and powers. This is why they can do
                       many things that seem to go against the laws of nature and that
                       no science can explain. Nevertheless, their power is limited to
                       boundaries established by God, especially in dealing with His
                       children.
                         They can appear as forms imitating deceased people. They
                       can transmit information unknown to the mediums and the
                       receivers. They manifest themselves as apparitions or ghosts.
                       They cause rappings, instruments to play by themselves, mes-
                       sages to be written without hand, people to be taken mysteri-
                       ously from one place to a distant place in a short time. Also they
                       cause persons or heavy objects to be elevated in the air without
                       human aid (telekinesis), and mediums to speak with another
                       voice. Many other things which we do not have room to describe
                       here are part of modern spiritualism.

                         What does the Word of God say about the ability of de-
                       ceased people to participate in the affairs of this world? Ecci.
                       9:5, 6.

                          Since the evil spirits who are the cause of all the spiritualistic
                       phenomena pretend to be the spirits of the dead, it is evident
                       that they are liars. Allan Kardec, an apostle of spiritualism,
                       admits that "communications that are received from the spirits
                       may be ... true or false, ... according to the nature of the spirit
                       that presents itself." "Lying spirits may be erratic." "There are
                       some [spirits] that are satisfied with being trifling and mischiev-

Spiritualism and the Occult          LESSON 7                      ❑ Wednesday
                                                                        May 16

           Part 4     What is the devil's main objective?
         GOAL OF
    SPIRITUALISM      "Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as
                    a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour"
                    (1 Peter 5:8).

                      Satan is always trying to conquer the human mind and the will
                    so as to destroy the person. In order to achieve this goal he uses
                    deceit. Even his wonders are "lying wonders."

                      What great wonders does John prophesy will be performed
                    to deceive the world in the last days? Rev. 13:13, 14.

                       It is evidently through the power of the evil spirits, with whom
                    it will be allied (Rev. 16:13, 14), that the second beast of Revela-
                    tion 13 "doeth great wonders."
                       Consider how every miracle of the evil spirits is done in order
                    to deceive:
                       They impersonate deceased human beings, making people
                    believe that they are actually communicating with spirits of the
                    dead.
                       They imitate the voices and appearance of deceased persons.
                       They reveal many secrets.
                       They convey information by extrasensory means.
                       In the future the devil will add to these deceptions attempts to
                    impersonate Christ Himself (Matt. 24:23-27), and he will even
                    endeavor to imitate the second coming of Christ.
                       All this is done to convince the human mind that these evil
                    spirits are the true spirits of the dead and that spiritualism is an
                    authentic way of communicating with deceased persons.
                       As in the Garden of Eden, the devil is fighting to conquer the
                    human mind and the will in order to lead men and women to
                    perdition.

THINK IT THROUGH      What is the difference in the way in which God and Satan
                    endeavor to gain the human heart? What is the ultimate con-
                    sequence of heeding the voice of Christ through the Holy
                    Spirit as He knocks at the door of the heart instead of following
                    the deceiver? (See Rev. 3:20; Mark 5:1-5; Deut. 30:19.)

                       "God never forces the will or the conscience; but Satan's
                    constant resort—to gain control of those whom he cannot
                    otherwise seduce—is compulsion by cruelty."—The Great Con-

           Part 5   What is John's caution about spirits?
 SPIRIT COMMUNI-
      CATION AND    "Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether
     CHRISTIANITY they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out
                  into the world" (1 John 4:1).

                       It is a contradiction to claim to have faith in Jesus Christ and at
                    the same time trust in spiritualism. It is condemned in the Bible,
                    and its fundamental teachings are out of harmony with the
                    teachings of the Scriptures. For example:
                       1. Its basic belief, that the dead are still alive and intelligent, is
                    contrary to the clear Bible teaching that the dead are not alive
                    and they know nothing.
                       2. "God has expressly forbidden all pretended communica-
                    tion with departed spirits. In the days of the Hebrews there was a
                    class of people who claimed, as do the spiritualists of today, to
                    hold communication with the dead. But the 'familiar spirits,' as
                    these visitants from other worlds were called, are declared by
                    the Bible to be 'the spirits of devils.' (Compare Numbers 25:1-3;
                    Psalm 106:28; 1 Corinthians 10:20; Revelation 16:14.)"—The
                    Great Controversy, p. 556.
                       Even prominent Christian leaders are deceived by these
                    spirits. No less than 15 bishops of the Anglican Church serve on
                    the advisory board of that church's Fellowship for Psychical
                    and Spiritual Studies, a spiritualistic organization with head-
                    quarters in London.
                       It is interesting to remember the case of the late Episcopal
                    Bishop James A. Pike. In an effort to establish communication
                    with his son, dead from suicide, Pike relied on the services of a
                    pastor who was also a medium. The story made headlines in the
                    newspapers of North America in 1966. The truth is, though, that
                    not only Bishop Pike but many other clergymen and ministers of
                    Christian churches have had an intimate association with
                    spiritualistic activities. Some of these activities are disguised by
                    names such as "psychical research," "parapsychology,"
                    "spiritual frontiers," "extrasensory perception," and others.
                    Some ministers are officers and leaders of spiritualistic organi-
                    zations, and in some cases they are also mediums, as in the case
                    of the pastor who aided Bishop Pike.

                      What three criteria in the following texts help us to decide
                    about the source of spiritualism? Isa. 8:20; 1 John 4:3; Matt.
                    7:16, 17.

THINK IT THROUGH      In this day when psychic phenomena are so popular, what
                    can I do to persuade as many as possible to reject all forms of
                    spiritualism?

                                                                              May 18

  THE SOURCE OF     and heavy-laden?
TRUE KNOWLEDGE
                       "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I
                    will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for
                    I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your
                    souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light" (Matt.
                    11:28-30).

                        One of the main objectives of man in looking into the theories
                    and activities of spiritualism, the occult, and kindred beliefs, is
                    to solve his problem of moral and physical pain and to alleviate
                    his hopelessness. But all the psychic disciplines and spiritualis-
                    tic activities are powerless to confront successfully the deep
                    problems of the soul. There is only one way to salvation.
                        "Christ is the wellspring of life. That which many need is to
                    have a clearer knowledge of Him; they need to be patiently and
                    kindly, yet earnestly, taught how the whole being may be thrown
                    open to the healing agencies of heaven. When the sunlight of
                    God's love illuminates the darkened chambers of the soul, rest-
                    less weariness and dissatisfaction will cease, and satisfying joys
                    will give vigor to the mind and health and energy to the
                    body."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 247.
                        What spiritualism cannot give, Christ bestows abundantly:
                        1. Physical and mental rest ease the burdens. (Matt. 11:28-
                    30.)
                        2. Confession of sin directly to God not only relieves guilt but
                    grants divine pardon of all past sin. (Read Ps. 32:1-5.)
                        3. Bible study, secret prayer, surrender to Christ, and the
                     indwelling of the Spirit produce a complete transformation of
                     life and open a new and beautiful road to a life of victory,
                     service, and happiness. (Read 2 Cor. 5:17.)
                        "Those who oppose the teachings of spiritualism are assail-
                     ing, not men alone, but Satan and his angels. They have entered
                     upon a contest against principalities and powers and wicked
                     spirits in high places. Satan will not yield one inch of ground
                     except as he is driven back by the power of heavenly messen-
                     gers. The people of God should be able to meet him, as did our
                     Saviour, with the words: 'It is written.' Satan can quote Scrip-
                     ture now as in the days of Christ, and he will pervert its teach-
                     ings to sustain his delusions. Those who would stand in this
                     time of peril must understand for themselves the testimony of
                      the Scriptures."—The Great Controversy, p. 559.

   Jesus loved His people, and He
wanted to protect them through the
ages from the deceptions of Satan.
   He foresaw the spiritual confusion
of these last days that would spread
darkness among the inhabitants of
this planet. He foresaw the
proliferation of so-called Christian
theologies and philosophies that
would constitute Babylon. Also He
saw Satan developing his many
schemes in order to becloud human
minds and consciences.
   He saw the spirits of devils operating
closely with the churches and
capturing the interest of all kinds of
peoples—religious, pagan,
superstitious, educated. Therefore,
He inspired His writers to record a
number of important prophecies. He
did this to make it possible for human
beings to unmask any kind of
erroneous philosophy or institution.
    This is why, after Christ predicted
 the rise of false prophets and
deceitful spiritual powers, He added:

                    great day of God Almighty" (Rev. 16:13, 14).

                        We have noted that these three spirits represent three
                      powers: (1) the beast—Rome; (2) the dragon—spiritualism; (3)
                      the false prophet—apostate Protestantism.
                        We see here that spiritualism (the dragon) in all its numerous
                      modern forms will constitute one of the three great powers that
                      will form an alliance in order to persecute and delude. At the
                      same time we see that every one of the three spirits—even the
                      one that comes out of the mouth of the Roman power and the
                      one that comes out of the mouth of the false prophet—are also
                      spirits of devils. This shows that spiritualism will be not only one
                      of the three but the main one, the one that will dominate and
                      unite them.

                        What are the two great beliefs that help tie the three powers
                      together?

                         "Through the two great errors, the immortality of the soul and
                      Sunday sacredness, Satan will bring the people under his
                      deceptions."—The Great Controversy, p. 588.
                         "A belief in spiritual manifestations opens the door to seduc-
                      ing spirits and doctrines of devils, and thus the influence of evil
                      angels will be felt in the churches."—The Great Controversy,
                      p. 604.

THINK IT THROUGH       What are some of the subtle ways besides spiritualism in
                      which Satan attacks us?

                        "Satan studies every indication of the frailty of human nature,
                      he marks the sins which each individual is inclined to commit,
                      and then he takes care that opportunities shall not be wanting to
                      gratify the tendency to evil.:'—The Great Controversy, p. 555.

          Parl 2   How does Paul predict the occurrence of satanic delusions
        SATANIC and lying wonders?
      DELUSIONS
                   "Then shall that Wicked be revealed, ... whose coming is
                 after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying
                 wonders, and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in
                 them that perish" (2 Thess. 2:8-10).

                     "No mere impostures are here foretold. Men are deceived by
                   the miracles which Satan's agents have power to do, not which
                   they pretend to do."—The Great Controversy, p. 553.
                     Ellen White, writing of the growth of spiritualism, says:
                   "Through the agency of spiritualism, miracles will be wrought,
                   the sick will be healed, and many undeniable wonders will be
                   performed."—The Great Controversy, p. 588.

                     To what extent will Satan have power to work miracles in
                   order to delude people? Rev. 13:13, 14.

                      This power that works great wonders is the lamblike beast,
                   namely the United States. But evidently it works miracles by the
                   power of Satan through spiritualism, with whom it is allied. (See
                   Rev. 16:13, 14.)
                      "Through spiritualism, Satan appears as a benefactor of the
                   race, healing the diseases of the people, and professing to
                   present a new and more exalted system of religious faith; but at
                   the same time he works as a destroyer. His temptations are
                   leading multitudes to ruin. Intemperance dethrones reason;
                   sensual indulgence, strife, and bloodshed follow. Satan de-
                   lights in war. . . .
                      "... In accidents and calamities by sea and by land, in great
                   conflagrations, in fierce tornadoes and terrific hailstorms, in
                   tempests, floods, cyclones, tidal waves, and earthquakes, in
                   every place and in a thousand forms, Satan is exercising his
                   power. He sweeps away the ripening harvest, and famine and
                   distress follow. He imparts to the air a deadly taint, and
                   thousands perish by the pestilence. These visitations are to
                   become more and more frequent and disastrous."—The Great

THINK IT THROUGH    What temptations may be devised by spiritualism that
                   would be attractive to Seventh-day Adventists?

                     "Love is dwelt upon as the chief attribute of God, but it is
                   degraded to a weak sentimentalism, making little distinction
                   between good and evil. God's justice, His denunciations of sin,
                   the requirements of His holy law, are all kept out of sight. The
                   people are taught to regard the Decalogue as a dead letter."—

           Part 3   What did Paul say is a tactic of Satan and his agents?
     THE MASTER
        ATTEMPT     "Nor do their tactics surprise me when I consider how Satan
       OF SATAN himself masquerades as an angel of light. It is only to be
                  expected that his agents shall have the appearance of minis-
                  ters of righteousness—but they will get what they deserve in
                  the end" (2 Cor. 11:14, 15, Phillips).

                      Before the coming of Jesus there will be outstanding in-
                   stances of this transformation of Satan into an angel of light and
                   his ministers into ministers of righteousness. Ellen White de-
                   scribes it in The Great Controversy, page 624.
                      "As the crowning act in the great drama of deception, Satan
                   himself will personate Christ. The church has long professed to
                   look to the Saviour's advent as the consummation of her hopes.
                   Now the great deceiver will make it appear that Christ has come.
                   In different parts of the earth, Satan will manifest himself among
                   men as a majestic being of dazzling brightness, resembling the
                   description of the Son of God given by John in the Revelation.
                   Revelation 1:13-15. The glory that surrounds him is unsur-
                   passed by anything that mortal eyes have yet beheld. The shout
                   of triumph rings out upon the air: 'Christ has come! Christ has
                   come!' The people prostrate themselves in adoration before
                   him, while he lifts up his hands and pronounces a blessing upon
                   them, as Christ blessed His disciples when He was upon the
                   earth. His voice is soft and subdued, yet full of melody. In gentle,
                   compassionate tones he presents some of the same gracious,
                   heavenly truths which the Saviour uttered; he heals the dis-
                   eases of the people, and then, in his assumed character of
                   Christ, he claims to have changed the Sabbath to Sunday, and
                   commands all to hallow the day which he has blessed. He
                   declares that those who persist in keeping holy the seventh day
                   are blaspheming his name by refusing to listen to his angels
                   sent to them with light and truth. This is the strong, almost
                   overmastering delusion."

                   say they would be? Matt. 24:24.

                   word that they would not yield to the evidence of their senses?

                                                                          May 23

          Part 4  Where is truth found?
      A DEFENSE
        AGAINST   "Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth" (John
      DECEPTION 17:17).

                      We should be thankful to God that He has not left us in
                   uncertainty regarding the way of salvation. We have an inspired
                   Book that is the truth itself. It is the test for other claims of truth.
                   So in order to be defended against error and deception, we
                   should cling to it as to an immovable rock in a turbulent sea.
                      With an unbiased study of the Bible, comparing passage with
                   passage and investigating all the scriptures that deal with a
                   specific subject, we have the whole picture before us and the
                   truth becomes clear. Any doctrine, any theory, any philosophy
                   that does not fit into that picture is a deception. So long as we
                   trust in God and remain on the platform of His Word, nothing
                   will be able to move us from that firm foundation.
                      But we need to study the Word for ourselves and not simply
                   take it for granted or rely on a secondhand knowledge. We must
                   eat of the bread of life ourselves in order to be fed. No one can
                   eat for us.
                      "The people of God will not be misled. The teachings of this
                   false christ [Satan] are not in accordance with the Scriptures.
                   His blessing is pronounced upon the worshipers of the beast
                   and his image, the very class upon whom the Bible declares that
                   God's unmingled wrath shall be poured out. .
                      "Only those who have been diligent students of the Scrip-
                   tures and who have received the love of the truth will be
                   shielded from the powerful delusion that takes the world
                   captive."—The Great Controversy, p. 625.

           Part 5  What knowledge is essential to salvation?
 ONLY SAFEGUARD
         AGAINST   "This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true
 SPIRITUALISM--I God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent" (John 17:3).

                       The only way to obtain life eternal consists in knowing God
                   and in knowing Christ, in having a personal experience with
                   God the loving Father and Christ the Saviour and best Friend.
                   Those who have an intimate relationship with the Lord have
                   both eternal life and a shield against deception.
                       How does a human being enter into that relation? How does
                   he go about knowing God the Father and the Son, his Re-
                   deemer, in a real way? First of all he studies the Word. He
                   studies it in a search for the truth because he feels a deep
                   spiritual need. He not only reads and understands, but he also
                   takes time to meditate, to apply the Word to his personal life, to
                   contemplate the wonderful character of Jesus. And by "behold-
                   ing as in a glass the glory of the Lord" (2 Cor. 3:18), by dwelling
                   on the meekness of Jesus, on His love, His patience, His purity,
                   His self-denial, His self-control, he is "changed into the same
                   image."
                      Second, he obtains a closer walk with Jesus by a life of prayer.
                   He loves to talk with God, not only in family worship and in
                   church and groups, but alone. He opens his heart completely
                   every day and exposes his life to the wonderful light of heaven,
                   and that light expels all darkness and impresses in his heart the
                   perfect character of Jesus. There are no unconfessed sins in his
                   life. The way of communication with God is always open; and he
                   is not only cleansed from all unrighteousness and accepted in
                   the Beloved, but he becomes a true partaker of the divine na-
                   ture. Gratitude to God is always flowing from his lips, and the joy
                   and love imparted by the Holy Spirit make him a kind and a
                   happy Christian in spite of trials. By experience he learns to pray
                   better, and the result is power and grace from on high.
                      Under part 6 we will consider two more elements in the barrier
                   against sin and deception.

THINK IT THROUGH      "Many attend religious services, and are refreshed and
                   comforted by the word of God; but through neglect of medita-
                   tion, watchfulness, and prayer, they lose the blessing. .. . It
                   would be well for us to spend a thoughtful hour each day in

           Part 6   Why is it that the sheep follow their own shepherd?
 ONLY SAFEGUARD
         AGAINST    "When he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before
 SPIRITUALISM—II them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice" (John
                  10:4).

                      What an apt illustration this is of the right relationship of the
                   true children of God with their beloved Shepherd, Jesus! The
                   sheep follow the Shepherd because they know Him, and they
                   are well acquainted with His voice.
                      The best safeguard against any delusion or temptation is an
                   intimate knowledge of and a close relationship with the only
                   Shepherd. Under part 5 we learned that this personal knowl-
                   edge that brings life eternal and safety is achieved (1) through a
                   fervent, daily study of the Word of God, and (2) by a life of daily,
                   sincere prayer.
                      But there are two more elements: (1) a daily surrender to God
                   to obey Him; and (2) a witness about God to others for a healthy
                   Christian experience.
                      Jesus is always lovingly knocking at the door of our heart,
                   willing to enter in order to bless us. But if we are too busy, or if
                   there is too much trash that blocks the door, He cannot enter.
                   So, along with meditation and prayer, there should be a daily
                   and complete surrender of our will to His divine leadership.
                      "When the soul surrenders itself to Christ, a new power takes
                   possession of the new heart. A change is wrought which man
                    can never accomplish fOr himself. . . . A soul thus kept in
                    possession by the heavenly agencies is impregnable to the
                    assaults of Satan. But unless we do yield ourselves to the con-
                   trol of Christ, we shall be dominated by the wicked one."—The
                   Desire of Ages, p. 324.
                      But our Christian experience cannot be complete without a
                    witnessing activity, without sharing with others what Christ has
                    done for us.

Spirit gave them utterance" (Acts
2:1-4).

  The greatest thing that ever
hippened to the Christian church
happened at Pentecost. Jesus had told
His disciples that they must wait in
Jerusalem until they should be endued
with power (Acts 1:4), a power to
witness which would accompany the
outpouring of the Holy Spirit. When it
came, the disciples were able to
preach the gospel in such a way that
everyone received the message in his
own language (Acts 2:6). Such a
spiritual manifestation was convincing
evidence that what was preached was
true.
   The church must always have the
power of the Holy Spirit in order to
carry on its witness. In the world,
where there are so many languages
and dialects, it is necessary to speak
in the language or dialect of every
nation, tribe, and people. That is why     DAILY HIGHLIGHTS

True and False                                                                   May 27

              Part 1    In what context does the apostle Paul place the gift of
           SPEAKING tongues?
        IN TONGUES
                        "God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondar-
                     ily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of
                     healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues" (1 Cor.
                     12:28).

                        The ability to speak more than one language is obviously one
                      of the gifts of the Holy Spirit. Not all have facility with language.
                      Some have great difficulty in expressing themselves even in one
                      language! But the ability to transmit accurately and explain
                      clearly is a gift of inestimable value, especially in expounding
                      the Word of God.

                        What is the main purpose of having the gift of tongues? Acts
                      1:8.
                        The tongue is a very important member of the human body.
                      James likens it to a fire (James 3:6). When it is used in
                      evangelism, thousands can be converted in a day. But when it is
                      used to gossip or propagate evil, it can do untold harm.

                        What two experiences are recorded in Acts that tell us of the
                      manifestation of the gift of tongues in the early church? Acts
                      10:45, 46; 19:5, 6.

                        The early Christian church had obvious examples of the gift of
                      tongues in the experiences of Peter and of Paul. In the case of
                      certain Gentiles whom Peter visited they "glorified God." In the
                      case of Paul his converts "prophesied." In each case the
                      tongue was used in an acceptable manner.
                        Ellen White, in referring to the speech of the disciples after
                      the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, says that from that time forth
                      "the language of the disciples was pure, simple, and accurate,
                      whether they spoke in their native tongue or in a foreign
                      language."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 40. Here is an ideal of
                      the use of language that is placed before every disciple, an ideal
                      that can be reached only with a total surrender to the power of
                      the Holy Spirit.

THINK IT THROUGH        If the gift of tongues is so important for the propagation of
                      the gospel, why is it that this gift is not more manifest in the
                      church today?

                         The answer to the above question will depend somewhat on
                      our understanding of what is involved in the phenomenon of
                      speaking in tongues. Is the gift of tongues as necessary today as
                      it was on the day of Pentecost?

Spiritual Manifestations,       LESSON 9                               ❑ Monday
True and False                                                           May 28

          Part 2     "Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather
        A FALSE    that ye may prophesy" (1 Cor. 14:1).
       PRIORITY
                      The gifts of the Spirit are given to the church for its edifica-
                   tion. Not all the gifts are manifested at one time, nor is one gift
                   made to be the indispensable criterion of discipleship. God
                   knows how to distribute His gifts and when they are needed. It is
                   not for us to demand a gift or to be proud if we have one. Yet it is
                   in this very area that we find a counterfeit manifestation of the
                   gift of tongues. Some churches claim that this is a necessary
                   attribute of discipleship. Others take pride in it.

                     What problems did Paul face in connection with a manifes-
                   tation of the phenomenon of speaking in tongues? 1 Cor.
                   14:2-9.

                     The one who speaks with an unknown tongue is not helping
                   anyone if his language is not understood. Paul tells us that the
                   object of fellowship in the church is communication and mutual
                   help. If a person wants to speak to God in an unknown tongue,
                   that is his privilege, but he should do so privately and not take
                   up the time and attention of other members who are not able to
                   profit from his talk. In all church activity we must be practical;
                   we must contribute some good.
                     Paul did not deny the possibility that someone in Corinth
                   spoke with tongues through the influence of the Holy Spirit. But
                   he did suggest that there are other gifts that can do much more
                   good. The Christian must not be selfish or boastful when it
                   comes to gifts he or she may have. Every gift must contribute to
                   the welfare of the church as a whole, and only if it does so can it
                   be manifested in public.

                     What was Paul's attitude to the gift of tongues? 1 Cor. 14:
                   18, 19.

                      Many churches today are excited about glossolalia. We must
                   make certain that we are not deceived by an outward manifesta-
                   tion that could very well be the working of Satan to deceive
                   some gullible Christians into thinking that they are being moti-
                   vated by the Holy Spirit when in fact they are being used by
                   Satan for his nefarious purposes.

THINK IT THROUGH    On what basis can I differentiate the true and the false
                   manifestations of the gift of tongues in the church?

                     The counterfeit is often so nearly like the true that it can
                   deceive many. We must be so well schooled in the true that we
                   can detect error immediately. This is the challenge that faces
                   every Christian today.

True and False                                                                    May 29

              Part 3     What is the wise counsel given by the apostle John?
            TESTING
         THE SPIRITS     "Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether
                       they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out
                       into the world" (1 John 4:1).

                         In John's day there were false spirits and false prophets as
                       there have been such manifestations ever since Satan has been
                       abroad to deceive men. We must not be surprised if we meet
                       such phenomena today; in fact, it is likely that Satan will in-
                       crease his efforts to deceive man as he sees the end of the world
                       approaching. (See 1 Peter 5:8.) It is a Christian duty to dif-
                       ferentiate between the true and the false.

                         How can we recognize the true Spirit? John 16:13, 14.

                          The true Spirit guides into all truth. If we find a spirit teaching
                       any doctrine that is different from the teaching of the Scrip-
                       tures, then we must know that this cannot be a true spirit. Jesus
                       said that He is "the way, the truth, and the life" (John 14:6). He
                       also said that God's Word is truth (John 17:17). There can be no
                       contradiction between the life and teachings of Jesus and the
                       lives and conduct of those who claim to represent Him through
                       spiritual manifestations.
                          Some think that when they have spoken in tongues they have
                       reached the highest goal of Christian achievement. In their
                       pride they have forgotten that there must be a correct interpre-
                       tation of Scripture, a balance in the Christian life, and that its
                       fruit is obedience to the commandments of God.

                         What does Paul say about the distribution of gifts? 1 Cor.
                       12:8-11.

                         To suggest, as some do, that everyone must speak in tongues
                       as a manifestation of conversion is not a teaching of Scripture.

THINK IT THROUGH        Why is it dangerous to depend on feelings and unusual
                       manifestations to prove whether we are right or wrong?

                         God has given us a mind to reason with, a body of truth to
                       grasp and understand. To depend wholly on emotion is to ne-
                       glect an important part of our being, a part that makes us truly
                       the children of God, created in His image. Emotion has its part
                       to play in human life, and we must not deprive ourselves of the
                       joys that come from achievement and understanding, but
                       neither must we neglect the use of the intellect which ties up
                       everything into an integrated whole. Blessed is the man who has
                       a balanced view of life and the part he has to play in it.

           Part 4  What sound principle did Jesus propound to indicate the
         NOTING difference between the true and the false?
      THE FRUITS
                   "By their fruits ye shall know them" (Matt. 7:20).

                      Nature gives us an object lesson that cannot be controverted:
                    a good tree brings forth good fruit, and a bad tree cannot help
                    but bring forth bad fruit. The lesson is just as simple in the
                    spiritual world as in the natural.
                      It is interesting to note that Satan cannot deny his nature. He
                    may try to conceal his intentions; his followers may show some
                    admirable attributes. But somehow, somewhere, the truth will
                    out, and it will be manifest that the works are basically evil and
                    the results of his activity are always unfortunate. God's Spirit
                    leads to life, joy, and happiness. The spirits in league with Satan
                    lead to frustration, confusion, and death.

                      What warning did Paul give regarding events in the last
                    days? 1 Tim. 4:1, 2.

                      These words are straightforward. The New English Bible
                    translates: "The Spirit says expressly that in after times some
                    will desert from the faith and give their minds to subversive
                    doctrines inspired by devils, through the specious falsehoods
                    of men whose own conscience is branded with the devil's sign."

                      What good advice does Paul give Timothy and all of us who
                    desire to do what is right? 1 Tim. 6:11.

                      There is a battle to be fought, a race to be run, a victory to be
                    gained. Especially as we live in the last days, we must flee from
                    all that is destructive and false. There is "science falsely so
                    called," and there are "profane and vain babblings" which we
                    must avoid (1 Tim. 6:20).

                      What simple distinction does John make between the true
                    and the false? 1 John 3:7-10.

                      Jesus came to destroy the works of the devil (verse 8) because
                    these works lead to death. How then can Christians who claim
                    to follow in the footsteps of Jesus ever follow those whose
                    activities are subversive of the truth?

 THINK IT THROUGH      What are some of the spiritual manifestations that you have
                    witnessed that you are sure stem from the evil one, and what
                    is the evidence of your conclusion?

             Part 5   What imagery did Jesus use to indicate the existence of
          DECEPTIVE deceptive appearances?
       APPEARANCES
                      "Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's
                    clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves" (Matt. 7:15).

                         All that glitters is not gold. We must learn not to let the eyes
                      deceive us. When it comes to the difference between truth and
                      error, we must not be satisfied with a superficial look. We must
                      examine a movement or manifestation thoroughly so as to see
                      its inner motives, its guiding principles. It is not sufficient that it
                      seems to have worthy objectives. It must be examined as to its
                      source and principles of operation.

                        What counsel is given the Laodicean church regarding the
                      eyes? Rev. 3:18.

                        The loss of eyesight is a terrible calamity, but the loss of
                     spiritual eyesight, the ability to see the reality beyond the out-
                     ward appearances, is an even greater calamity.
                       Note the following description of a situation that will exist in
                     the last days:
                        "Before the final visitation of God's judgments upon the earth
                     there will be among the people of the Lord such a revival of
                     primitive godliness as has not been witnessed since apostolic
                     times. The Spirit and power of God will be poured out upon His
                     children.... The enemy of souls desires to hinder this work; and
                     before the time for such a movement shall come, he will en-
                     deavor to prevent it by introducing a counterfeit. In those
                     churches which he can bring under his deceptive power he will
                     make it appear that God's special blessing is poured out; there
                     will be manifest what is thought to be great religious interest.
                     Multitudes will exult that God is working marvelously for them,
                     when the work is that of another spirit. . . .
                       "... There is an emotional excitement, a mingling of the true
                     with the false, that is well adapted to mislead."—The Great
                     Controversy, p. 464.

THINK IT THROUGH        Why is it that a movement that appears spiritual is more
                     likely to deceive a Christian than a movement that is blatantly
                     evil?

                        Men react openly and quickly against anything that is patently
                     evil. But when a movement has some good qualities, it is not
                     easy to reject it. In fact, it is usual to condone the evil for the sake
                     of the good. Thus a compromise is made with evil, and this leads
                     inevitably to further compromise and eventually outright es-
                     pousal of sin.

True and False                                                            June 1

           Part 6   How did John differentiate between his baptism and the
      THE SPIRIT- baptism of the One who should come after him?
      FILLED LIFE
                    "I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he
                  that cometh after me is mightier than I : He shall baptize you
                  with the Holy Ghost, and with fire" (Matt. 3:11).

                     Every Christian has the privilege of being baptized with the
                   Holy Spirit. What does this mean? The following aspects of the
                   work of the Holy Spirit are important:
                     1. The Holy Spirit convinces of sin (John 16:8).
                      2. The Holy Spirit is an ever-present power in the life of the
                   Christian (John 14:16). The Holy Spirit guides into all truth, and
                   as the Christian follows in the way that is pointed out to him, he
                   is transformed and brings forth the fruits of the Spirit.
                      3. The Holy Spirit enables the Christian to give an effective
                   witness (Acts 1:8). His words and his life give the same message,
                   that Jesus is the Saviour from sin, the only hope of eternal life.
                      4. The Holy Spirit will be poured out in the last days in special
                   measure so that young and old will experience the phenomena
                   of prophecy, visions, and dreams (Acts 2:17). This last over-
                   whelming event is one that Satan would like to prevent, and
                   therefore he uses his counterfeit movements to try to divert the
                   Christian from the real to the false. It is this danger that every
                   Christian must avoid if he is to be saved in the kingdom.

                     What relationship does Jesus say He wants to enjoy with
                   every Christian? Rev. 3:20.

                     The symbol of Jesus standing at the door and knocking is a
                   very striking one. It shows how anxious Jesus is to commune
                   with the Christian. It also shows that the responsibility of open-
                   ing the door is wholly on the part of the individual. Finally, the
                   symbol of eating together at the same table brings out the close
                   relationship that can exist between the Lord and ourselves, so
                   that we can enjoy a fellowship in which no secrets are withheld
                   and where there can be mutual understanding and love.

THINK IT THROUGH      In view of the clear promises of God to His church, why is it
                   that the church does not seem to have taken full advantage of
                   its privileges? What changes do you think ought to be made in
                   your personal life so that the latter rain may be poured out?

              Part 1   At what particular time does Armageddon occur?
       THE TIME AND
         SETTING OF    "The sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river
       ARMAGEDDON Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of
                     the kings of the east might be prepared" (Rev. 16:12).

                       The preparation for Armageddon comes under the sixth
                     plague and the battle itself under the seventh. (See also Rev.
                     19:11-21.) It comes after the close of probation and is the final
                     major event before the coming of Jesus.

                      What is a possible interpretation of the drying up of the
                     Euphrates?

                        For those looking for a possible interpretation of this part of
                     the prophecy, we mention the following, which is just one
                     among several. (Let us remember, though, that the main fea-
                     tures of the conflict of Armageddon stay always the same and
                     are not affected by any one of the different interpretations
                     advanced for this specific verse.)
                        Euphrates is the literal river of the literal Babylon. But Baby-
                     lon in Revelation is symbolic of a religious power. It is logical
                     then to regard the Euphrates River as also symbolic. Waters are
                     peoples (Rev. 17:15). So the drying up of the Euphrates may
                     represent the withdrawal of support for symbolic Babylon by
                     the people who formerly upheld it.
                        The kings of the East may point to Christ and the armies of
                     heaven that come to fight against the wicked nations in order to
                     liberate the children of God.

                       What is one of the most important meanings of Armaged-
                     don?
                        At the climax of the struggle between the people of God and
                     the persecuting powers, when the saints will be under the
                     soon-to-be-executed death decree, the events of Armageddon
                     will be a sign of encouragement to the faithful that the great
                     liberation is coming in a short time.

THINK IT THROUGH      God never leaves us without hope. "Man's extremity is
                     God's opportunity" to show His power.

                       This is the promise: "There hath no temptation taken you but
                     such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not
                     suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the
                     temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to
                     bear it" (1 Cor. 10:13).
                       This promise applies to any individual or group, either now or
                     during the time of trouble.

          Part 2    What are the main features of the Battle of Armageddon?
          WHAT
    ARMAGEDDON      "I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth
           IS—I of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the
                  mouth of the false prophet. For they are the spirits of devils,
                  working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth
                  and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that
                  great day of God Almighty" (Rev. 16:13, 14).

                      We have already studied these three great powers and their
                   identification in lesson 4. The dragon is spiritualism and
                   paganism; the beast, Romanism; and the false prophet, apos-
                   tate Protestantism. These are the three forces that will ally
                   themselves under the leadership of Satan to fight against God,
                   the saints, and the truth.
                     The word "Armageddon" is used just once in the Scriptures,
                   in Revelation 16:16. Some have claimed that Armageddon is
                   Megiddo, but others see no relationship between the two names
                   except that they sound alike. This word (Armageddon) could be
                   taken as a symbolic expression used by the Scriptures to refer
                   to a worldwide battle in the great day of God.
                     A comparison of Revelation 16:13, 14 with other Scripture
                   passages and with pertinent paragraphs from the spirit of
                   prophecy leads to the following conclusions about Armaged-
                   don:
                     1. It is a battle between truth and error.
                     2. It is a conflict between Christ and Satan.
                     3. The fallen angels will be aligned with their leader, Satan.
                     4. The struggle will be directed against the children of God
                   and will bring about a great persecution.
                      5. The three apostate powers will participate actively in it.
                     6. These three powers, allied under the prince of darkness,
                   will level their attack at God and Christ in the person of His
                   faithful children. They will require all to receive the mark of the
                   beast (Rev. 13:16) and will rely on the aid of kings (governments)
                   to enforce their decrees (Rev. 16:14).
                      7. The forces of evil will be destroyed in the lake of fire and
                   the chidren of God will be liberated.
                      Armageddon is one of the final episodes in the conflict be-
                   tween good and evil, between truth and error, between Christ
                   and Satan with their respective followings of angels and men.

THINK IT THROUGH     Am I developing now the spiritual strength I need in order to
                   keep true to Christ in persecution and threat of death?

           IS—II    "I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he
                  that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righ-
                  teousness he doth judge and make war. . . . And he was

                  clean" (Rev. 19:11-14).

                      Read this complete Bible paragraph (Rev. 19:11-16). Note the
                   description of Christ and the armies of heaven making war
                    against the kings of the earth, their armies, and the beast and
                    the false prophet. (See verses 18, 19.)
                      The contending forces in the conflict will be formed, there-
                   fore, of the following: (1) Those arrayed against God; namely,
                   Satan, the demons, the three politicoreligious persecuting
                   powers, the kings of the earth, and the nations (wicked men). (2)
                   Those allied with God; namely, Christ and His angels and the
                   righteous of earth who uphold truth and profess loyalty to the
                   Creator and His law.
                      "The last great conflict between truth and error is but the final
                   struggle of the long-standing controversy concerning the law of
                   God."—The Great Controversy, p. 582.
                      "We need to study the pouring out of the seventh vial. The

                   from slumber, and the armies of the living God will take the
                   field."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary,

                      "A terrible conflict is before us. We are nearing the battle of
                   the great day of God Almighty. That which has been held in
                   control is to be let loose."... The earth is to be the battlefield—
                   the scene of the final contest and the final victory. Here, where
                   for so long Satan has led men against God, rebellion is to be
                   forever supressed."—Ellen G. White, Review and Herald, May

THINK IT THROUGH     Where shall Armageddon find me and my family? There
                   shall be no neutral place in that day. Am I wholeheartedly
                   enrolled under the banner of Emmanuel, or by my lukewarm
                   attitude have I divided interests? (See Matt. 12:30.)

                                                                       June 6

          Part 4     What relation do you see between Armageddon and the
     DESPAIR OF    following Old Testament passages?
     THE WICKED
                     "The Lord cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants
                   of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall disclose her
                   blood, and shall no more cover her slain" (Isa. 26:21).
                     "This shall be the plague wherewith the Lord will smite all
                   the people that have fought against Jerusalem" (Zech. 14:12).

                      (Read the remainder of verse 12 and verse 13.)
                      What are some of the feelings of the impenitent when they see
                   the result of their decisions? "Many of the wicked were greatly
                   enraged as they suffered the effects of the plagues. It was a
                   scene of fearful agony. Parents were bitterly reproaching their
                   children, and children their parents, brothers their sisters, and
                   sisters their brothers. Loud, wailing cries were heard in every
                   direction, 'It was you who kept me from receiving the truth
                   which would have saved me from this awful hour.' The people
                   turned upon their ministers with bitter hate and reproached
                   them, saying, 'You have not warned us. You told us that all the
                   world was to be converted, and cried, Peace, peace, to quiet
                   every fear that was aroused. You have not told us of this hour;
                   and those who warned us of it you declared to be fanatics and
                   evil men, who would ruin us.' But I saw that the ministers did not
                   escape the wrath of God. Their suffering was tenfold greater
                   than that of their people."—Early Writings, p. 282.
                      "The people see that they have been deluded. They accuse
                   one another of having led them to destruction; but all unite in
                   heaping their bitterest condemnation upon the ministers. Un-
                   faithful pastors have prophesied smooth things; they have led
                   their hearers to make void the law of God and to persecute those
                   who would keep it holy. Now, in their despair, these teachers
                   confess before the world their work of deception. The mul-
                   titudes are filled with fury. 'We are lost!' they cry, 'and you are
                   the cause of our ruin;' and they turn upon the false shepherds.
                   The very ones that once admired them most will pronounce the
                   most dreadful curses upon them. The very hands that once
                   crowned them with laurels will be raised for their destruction.
                   The swords which were to slay God's people are now employed
                   to destroy their enemies. Everywhere there is strife and
                   bloodshed."—The Great Controversy, pp. 655, 656.

THINK IT THROUGH     "When the voice of God turns the captivity of His people,
                   there is a terrible awakening of those who have lost all in the
                   great conflict of life.... The result is, their lives are a failure;
                   their pleasures are now turned to gall, their treasures to cor-
                   ruption. The gain of a lifetime is swept away in a moment."—

            Part 5      Study the description of the seventh plague.
     THE GLORIOUS
         OUTCOME       "The seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and
                     there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the
                     throne, saying, It is done. And there were voices, and thun-
                     ders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such
                     as was not since men were upon the earth. . . . And great
                     Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her
                     the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath" (Rev.
                     16:17-19).

                        (Read carefully verses 17 through 21.)
                        The great earthquake is not only a literal one, but also a
                     symbolic cataclysm that destroys spiritual Babylon. "The great
                     city [Babylon] was divided into three parts" (verse 19). Why?
                     Because that huge structure of error and deception was com-
                     posed of the threefold union of the great powers—the dragon,
                     the beast, and the false prophet.
                        But now, under the seventh plague, this unholy alliance loses
                     its coherence and is broken, and the three religious and politi-
                     cal forces begin to fight against each other.

                       What symbols are used in Revelation 19:11-16 to describe
                     the fierce battle between Christ and the world? What do they
                     mean?

                       What will be the outcome of Armageddon? Rev. 19:17-21.

                        An angel calls the fowls of heaven together in order to eat the
                     flesh of kings, captains, and mighty men. And John sees the
                     beast and the false prophet thrown into a lake of fire. This is not
                     the lake of fire that appears at the end of the millennium. He sees
                     the rest slain by the sword of the One that sat on the white horse.
                        As for the dragon, Satan himself and his devils will remain for
                     1000 more years on this devastated and solitary planet. They will
                     see the final results of their rebellion.
                        The victory of Jesus in the battle of Armageddon is absolute,
                     complete, and eternal. The liberation of the saints is final.

THINK IT THROUGH       Why has God waited so long to bring an end to sin? Why will
                     He delay 1000 years more in destroying Satan and the evil
                     spirits?

                       With this awful experience of sin, sorrow, and death, with the
                     complete development of the principles and plans of Satan, the
                     whole universe will have been effectively vaccinated against
                     sin. The wonderful love and justice of God will have been vindi-
                     cated forever, and the curse of sin will not arise the second time.

The Battle of Armageddon            LESSON 10                              ❑ Friday
                                                                               June 8

         Part 6      What solemn admonition does Jesus give in connection
        NOW IS     with the events of Armageddon?
      THE TIME!
                     "Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and
                   keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his
                   shame" (Rev. 16:15).

                     The only way to withstand the hour of God's judgment, the
                   Battle of Armageddon, is to acquire the garments of heaven.
                   The time to buy the white raiment to cover our spiritual naked-
                   ness is now. When Armageddon comes, probation will have
                   closed.
                     To watch and keep on the garments of the righteousness of
                   Christ—both forgiveness and victory, both justification and
                   sanctification—requires a constant faith in Jesus. He is the only
                   One who can give us this beautiful robe. He is the only One who
                   can cleanse us from all unrighteousness through faith in Him
                   that includes confession of sin. Only He can transfer to us His
                   perfect character.

                     What did Jesus teach about the relationship between Him-
                   self and the believer? John 15:4, 5.

                      The branch has life in it and retains the possibility of having
                   flowers and bearing fruit as long as it continues to be a part of
                   the vine. As soon as it is cut off the vine, it dies. The same
                   happens with the child of God. The only possibility of having a
                   fruitful life is to abide in Christ, to be vitally united with Him, and
                   to depend upon Him every moment.
                      "Many have an idea that they must do some part of the work
                   alone. They have trusted in Christ for the forgiveness of sin, but
                   now they seek by their own efforts to live aright. But every such
                   effort must fail. Jesus says, 'Without Me ye can do nothing.' Our
                   growth in grace, our joy, our usefulness,—all depend upon our
                   union with Christ. It is by communion with Him, daily, hourly,—
                   by abiding in Him,—that we are to grow in grace. He is not only
                   the Author, but the Finisher of our faith. It is Christ first and last
                   and always. He is to be with us, not only at the beginning and the
                   end of our course, but at every step of the way. David says, 'I
                    have set the Lord always before me: because He is at my right
                    hand, I shall not be moved.' Psalm 16:8."—Steps to Christ, p. 69.

THINK IT THROUGH     What is the specific meaning of abiding in Christ? How do
                   we become united with Christ in a contact as close as the
                   branch and the vine?

But when sin entered into the picture,
the plans of heaven were temporarily

   Sin has spoiled the beauty and

Nevertheless, God did not give up His
plan for a happy, holy human family.
For this reason God will intervene in
our world to destroy sorrow and sin.

       THE SEVENTH      tion with the seventh plague:
            PLAGUE         1. A great voice from heaven proclaims, "It is done." This is
                        the very last hour of turmoil and destruction. It is the hour of the
                        judgment of God on the inhabitants of this world.
                           2. There were lightnings, voices, and thunders. The mighty
                        elements of nature are used by the Lord to signify His disap-
                        proval of the behavior of the unjust who are about to destroy the
                        loyal children of God.
                           3. A gigantic earthquake, the greatest in human history,
                        shakes the earth.
                           4. The great city, spiritual Babylon—the alliance of confusion
                       and apostate spiritual powers—is divided into three parts. In
                        other words, the three great powers that up to this point were
                        united in fighting against God, the truth, and the saints—
                        spiritualism, Romanism, and apostate Protestantism—now pull
                       aside from each other and begin fighting against each other,
                       thus producing the destruction of Babylon.
                          5. The other "cities of the nations" fall. The whole world is in
                       gigantic turmoil.
                          6. Islands flee, and mountains disappear. The actual physical
                       shape of this planet changes.
                          7. Hail falls from heaven, each hailstone the weight of a
                       talent, which is about 66 pounds or 30 kilograms.
                          This is the awesome picture of the hour of the judgments of
                       God in which this world will be destroyed.
                          But the most important aspect of all this scene is that the
                       children of God will be liberated at the destruction of the impen-
                       itent.

THINK IT THROUGH         What will determine whether I will be with the happy people
                       of God, who are liberated during the seventh plague, or with
                       the great majority, that will be destroyed? Is it safe for me to
                       postpone my surrender and my taking full advantage of the
                       grace and mercy of God? (See Ps. 95:7, 8.)

                                                                            June 11

           Part 2     Read Ps. 37:40.
    AT THE HOUR
     OF UTMOST         It will be midnight, as the death decree becomes effective and
      EXTREMITY     the wicked are about to destroy the children of God, when the
                    God of heaven intervenes in an unprecedented way to liberate
                    the saints. At the "hour of utmost extremity" God will protect
                    His own and will destroy the sinners.
                       "The Lord is doing His work. All heaven is astir. The Judge of
                    all the earth is soon to arise and vindicate His insulted authority.
                    The mark of deliverance will be set upon the men who keep
                    God's commandments, who revere His law, and who refuse the
                    mark of the beast or of his image."—Testimonies, vol. 5, pp. 451,
                    452.
                       "When the defiance of the law of Jehovah shall be almost
                    universal, when his people shall be pressed in affliction by their
                    fellow men, God will interpose. The fervent prayers of his people
                     will be answered."—Ellen G. White, Review and Herald, June
                    15, 1897.
                        "The people of God—some in prison cells, some hidden in
                     solitary retreats in the forests and the mountains—still plead for
                     divine protection, while in every quarter companies of armed
                     men, urged on by hosts of evil angels, are preparing for the work
                     of death. It is now, in the hour of utmost extremity, that the God
                     of Israel will interpose for the deliverance of His chosen."—The
                    Great Controversy, p. 635.
                        "Then all the saints cried out with anguish of spirit, and were
                     delivered by the voice of God. The 144,000 triumphed. Their
                     faces were lighted up with the glory of God."—Early Writings,
                     p. 37.
                        "Satan's host and wicked men will surround them, and exult
                     over them, because there will seem to be no way of escape for
                     them. But in the midst of their revelry and triumph, there is
                     heard peal upon peal of the loudest thunder. The heavens have
                     gathered blackness, and are only illuminated by the blazing
                     light and terrible glory from heaven, as God utters His voice
                     from His holy habitation.
                        "The foundations of the earth shake; buildings totter and fall
                     with a terrible crash. The sea boils like a pot, and the whole earth
                     is in terrible commotion. The captivity of the righteous is turned,
                     and with sweet and solemn whisperings they say to one
                     another: 'We are delivered. It is the voice of God.' "—Testi-
                     monies, vol. 1, p. 354.

 THINK IT THROUGH     God also can intervene in a merciful and miraculous way in
                    our own personal life, at the hour of utmost extremity, to solve
                    our biggest problems if we trust Him and depend on Him.

             Part 3      Five of the seven events that we have noted in Revelation
       CATACLYSMIC     16:17-21 are happenings in nature. Read this passage again.
         EVENTS—I      These events lead up to the coming of Jesus.
                         Compare the events named in Revelation 16:17-21 with those
                       given in Revelation 6:14-17. It is during these events that the
                       faithful believers are liberated.
                         Ellen White makes these further comments on the events in
                       nature under the seventh plague:
                         "With shouts of triumph, jeering, and imprecation, throngs of
                       evil men are about to rush upon their prey, when, lo, a dense
                       blackness, deeper than the darkness of the night, falls upon the
                       earth. Then a rainbow, shining with the glory from the throne of
                      God, spans the heavens and seems to encircle each praying
                      company. The angry multitudes are suddenly arrested. Their
                      mocking cries die away. The objects of their murderous rage are
                      forgotten. With fearful forebodings they gaze upon the symbol
                      of God's covenant and long to be shielded from its overpower-
                      ing brightness."—The Great Controversy, pp. 635, 636.
                         "Then the sun, moon, and stars will be moved out of their
                      places. They will not pass away, but be shaken by the voice of
                      God."—Early Writings, p. 41.
                         "Signs and wonders followed in quick succession. Every-
                      thing seemed turned out of its natural course. The streams
                      ceased to flow. Dark, heavy clouds came up and clashed against
                      each other."—Early Writings, p. 285.
                         But through all of these catastrophes the redeemed will be
                      protected. "Christ has spoken: 'Come, My people, enter thou
                      into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself
                      as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast.
                      For, behold, the Lord cometh out of His place to punish the
                      inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity.' Isaiah 26:20, 21.
                      Glorious will be the deliverance of those who have patiently
                      waited for His coming and whose names are written in the book
                      of life."—The Great Controversy, p. 634.

Liberation of the Church          LESSON 11                        ❑ Wednesday
                                                                       June 13

            Part 4     During the seventh plague, what proclamation proceeds
        A SUDDEN     from God's throne?
       CHANGE IN
       THE SCENE       "There came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from
                     the throne, saying, It is done" (Rev. 16:17).

                        The declaration "It is done" will be spoken at the midnight
                     manifestation of God's power in nature. Amid the confusion
                     there will come a moment of assurance to God's people. Ellen
                     White describes it thus:
                        "By the people of God a voice, clear and melodious, is heard,
                     saying, 'Look up,' and lifting their eyes to the heavens, they
                     behold the bow of promise. The black, angry clouds that cov-
                     ered the firmament are parted, and like Stephen they look up
                     steadfastly into heaven and see the glory of God and the Son of
                     man seated upon His throne. In His divine form they discern the
                     marks of His humiliation; and from His lips they hear the request
                     presented before His Father and the holy angels: 'I will that they
                     also, whom Thou hast given Me, be with Me where I am.' John
                     17:24. Again a voice, musical and triumphant, is heard, saying:
                     'They come! they come! holy, harmless, and undefiled. They
                     have kept the word of My patience; they shall walk among the
                     angels;' and the pale, quivering lips of those who have held fast
                      their faith utter a shout of victory."—The Great Controversy,
                      p. 636.
                         "The Israel of God stood with their eyes fixed upward, listen-
                      ing to the words as they came from the mouth of Jehovah and
                      rolled through the earth like peals of loudest thunder. It was
                      awfully solemn. At the end of every sentence the saints shouted,
                      'Glory! Hallelujah!' Their countenances were lighted up with the
                      glory of God, and they shone with glory as did the face of Moses
                      when he came down from Sinai. The wicked could not look
                      upon them for the glory. And when the never-ending blessing
                      was pronounced on those who had honored God in keeping His
                      Sabbath holy, there was a mighty shout of victory over the beast
                      and over his image."—The Story of Redemption, pp. 409, 410.

 THINK IT THROUGH      Do I have the anticipation for Jesus' return reflected in the
                     words of Isaiah: "It shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God;
                     we have waited for him, and he will save us; this is the Lord;
                     we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his
                     salvation" (Isa. 25:9)?

            Part 5   What assurance can we gain today from the experience
       CATACLYSMIC mentioned in Psalm 76?
        EVENTS—II
                     "Thou, even thou, art to be feared: and who may stand in thy
                   sight when once thou art angry? Thou didst cause judgment to
                   be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was still, when
                   God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth" (Ps.
                   76:7-9).

                        After the declaration "It is done," the convulsion of nature will
                     continue.
                        "That voice [the voice of the Lord saying, "It is done"] shakes
                     the heavens and the earth. There is a mighty earthquake, 'such
                     as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earth-
                     quake, and so great.' Verses 17, 18. The firmament appears to
                     open and shut. The glory from the throne of God seems flashing
                     through. The mountains shake like a reed in the wind, and
                     ragged rocks are scattered on every side. There is a roar as of a
                     coming tempest. The sea is lashed into fury. There is heard the
                     shriek of a hurricane like the voice of demons upon a mission of
                     destruction. The whole earth heaves and swells like the waves
                     of the sea. Its surface is breaking up. Its very foundations seem
                     to be giving way. Mountain chains are sinking. Inhabited islands
                     disappear. The seaports that have become like Sodom for wick-
                     edness are swallowed up by the angry waters. Babylon the great
                     has come in remembrance before God, `to give unto her the cup
                     of the wine of the fierceness of His wrath.' Great hailstones,
                     every one 'about the weight of a talent,' are doing their work of
                     destruction. Verses 19, 21. The proudest cities of the earth are
                     laid low. The lordly palaces, upon which the world's great men
                     have lavished their wealth in order to glorify themselves, are
                     crumbling to ruin before their eyes. Prison walls are rent asun-
                     der, and God's people, who have been held in bondage for their
                     faith, are set free."—The Great Controversy, pp. 636, 637.

THINK IT THROUGH        God is as interested in helping and delivering each one of us
                     now in our day-to-day problems and trials as He will be at the

          Part 6     The events that we have studied thus far this week precede
     THE ADVENT    the coming of Jesus by only a very short time. The actual coming
                   of Jesus is described in several Bible passages. These will be
                   familiar to most who study this lesson, but a review of them can
                   make them even more familiar and call our attention again to
                   the one great event to which we look forward.

                     What is known about Jesus' coming? Rev. 1:7

                     What further information do you find in Jude 14, 15?

                     Read Matthew 24:30, 31. What do the angels do?

                     Can you find two other texts that give details about Jesus'
                   return?

                      "Christ will come in His own glory, in the glory of His Father,
                   and the glory of the holy angels. Ten thousand times ten
                   thousand, and thousands of thousands of angels, the beautiful
                   and triumphant sons of God, possessing surpassing loveliness
                   and glory, will escort Him on His way. Then shall He sit upon the
                   throne of His glory, and before Him shall be gathered all nations.
                   Then every eye shall see Him, and they also that pierced Him. In
                   the place of a crown of thorns, He will wear a crown of glory,—a
                   crown within a crown. In place of that old purple kingly robe, He
                   will be clothed in raiment of whitest white, 'so as no fuller on
                   earth can white them.' Mark 9:3. And on His vesture and on His
                   thigh a name will be written, 'King of kings, and Lord of lords.'
                   Rev. 19:16."—The Desire of Ages, p. 739.
                      "All heaven will be emptied of the angels. The waiting saints
                   will be looking for Him, and gazing into heaven, as were the
                   'men of Galilee' when He ascended from the Mount of Olivet.
                   Then, those only who are holy, those who have followed fully the
                   meek Pattern will, with rapturous joy, exclaim as they behold
                   Him, 'Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will
                   save us.' And they will be changed 'in a moment, in the twinkling
                   of an eye, at the last trump,' that wakes the sleeping saints, and
                    calls them forth from their dusty beds, clothed with glorious
                    immortality, shouting Victory! Victory! over death and the
                   grave. The changed saints are caught up together with them to
                    meet the Lord in the air, never more to be separated from the
                    object of their love."—Sons and Daughters of God, p. 360.

THINK IT THROUGH     Christians count any present so-called sacrifice worthwhile
                   in order for them to be counted among the blessed company
                   of the people of God in that wonderful day.

  "Ye shall have a song, as in the         during these times of comparative
night when a holy solemnity is kept;       calm and serenity so that when the
and gladness of heart, as when one         great day of God comes, we may keep

naturally, to have as exact an idea

appear evident from the analysis of

the way, that we have tried to include

             Part 1     What points in the following verses indicate a partial resur-
         A PARTIAL    rection of the wicked at the second advent?
     RESURRECTION
                        "Many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall
                      awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and
                      everlasting contempt" (Dan. 12:2).
                        "Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see
                      him, and they also which pierced him" (Rev. 1:7).

                         "Graves are opened, and 'many of them that sleep in the dust
                      of the earth . . . awake, some to everlasting life, and some to
                      shame and everlasting contempt.' Daniel 12:2. All who have
                      died in the faith of the third angel's message come forth from
                      the tomb glorified, to hear God's covenant of peace with those
                      who have kept His law. 'They also which pierced Him' (Revela-
                      tion 1:7), those that mocked and derided Christ's dying agonies,
                      and the most violent opposers of His truth and His people, are
                      raised to behold Him in His glory and to see the honor placed
                      upon the loyal and obedient.
                         "Thick clouds still cover the sky; yet the sun now and then
                      breaks through, appearing like the avenging eye of Jehovah.
                      Fierce lightnings leap from the heavens, enveloping the earth in
                      a sheet of flame. Above the terrific roar of thunder, voices,
                      mysterious and awful, declare the doom of the wicked. The
                      words spoken are not comprehended by all; but they are dis-
                      tinctly understood by the false teachers. Those who a little
                      before were so reckless, so boastful and defiant, so exultant in
                      their cruelty to God's commandment-keeping people, are now
                      overwhelmed with consternation and shuddering in fear. Their
                      wails are heard above the sound of the elements. Demons ac-

                      while men are supplicating for mercy and groveling in abject
                      terror."—The Great Controversy, pp. 637, 638.

                        What descriptions from Isaiah 2:10-12, 20, 21, written for
                      Judah, are also applicable to the second advent?

                        Many people have exalted their own opinions and ideas
                      above the law of God, and in their defiance they have perse-
                      cuted the righteous and have made preparation to kill them. Too
                      late they discover the result of their stubbornness, and with
                      great terror they cry to the mountains and to the rocks to fall on
                      them and hide them from the presence of Christ.

THINK IT THROUGH        To what extent am I taking advantage of the opportunities
                      and privileges God gives me today so that, whether I live until
                      the advent or I die under the faith of the third angel's message,
                      I may be in the redeemed throng?

                                                                         June 18

         Part 2  What is the comforting and encouraging promise that will be
    TWO GROUPS fulfilled in the great day of the Lord?

                     "God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in
                   trouble. Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be re-
                   moved, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of
                   the sea; though the waters thereof roar and be troubled,
                   though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof" (Ps.
                   46:1-3).

                     What will be the clear contrast between the two classes of
                   people?

                      The world at that time will be divided into two classes of
                   people. They will stand in bold contrast to each other because
                   of the principle each holds. Ellen White wrote this description:
                      "Through a rift in the clouds there beams a star whose bril-
                   liancy is increased fourfold in contrast with the darkness. It
                   speaks hope and joy to the faithful, but severity and wrath to the
                   transgressors of God's law. Those who have sacrificed all for
                   Christ are now secure, hidden as in the secret of the Lord's
                   pavilion. . . .
                         .. The clouds sweep back, and the starry heavens are seen,
                   unspeakably glorious in contrast with the black and angry fir-
                   mament on either side. The glory of the celestial city streams
                   from the gates ajar. Then there appears against the sky a hand
                   holding two tables of stone folded together. Says the prophet:
                   'The heavens shall declare His righteousness: for God is judge
                   Himself.' Psalm 50:6. That holy law, God's righteousness, that
                   amid thunder and flame was proclaimed from Sinai as the guide
                   of life, is now,revealed to men as the rule of judgment. The hand
                   opens the tables, and there are seen the precepts of the Dec-
                   alogue, traced as with a pen of fire."—The Great Controversy,
                   pp. 638, 639.
                      "The Lord here [in the story of Enoch] teaches a lesson of the
                    greatest importance by the translation of Enoch, a descendant
                    of fallen Adam, that all would be rewarded, who by faith would
                    rely upon the promised Sacrifice and faithfully obey His com-
                    mandments. Two classes are here again represented which
                    were to exist until the second coming of Christ—the righteous
                    and the wicked, the rebellious and the loyal. God will remember
                    the righteous, who fear Him. On account of His dear Son He will
                    respect and honor them and give them everlasting life. But the
                    wicked, who trample upon His authority, He will cut off and
                    destroy from the earth, and they will be as though they had not
                    been."—The Story of Redemption, pp. 59, 60.

THINK IT THROUGH     The same star that appears in the darkened heavens and
                   speaks hope and joy to the faithful conveys the wrath of God
                   and destruction to the unfaithful. How does this same princi-
                   ple apply to God's revelation today?

          Part 3   What illustration did Jesus use to describe His second corn-
    THE GLORIOUS ing?
  SECOND COMING
                   "As the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even
                 unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be"
                 (Matt. 24:27).

                    What will the voice of God proclaim very shortly before
                   Christ's actual coming?

                      "The voice of God is heard from heaven, declaring the day
                   and hour of Jesus' coming, and delivering the everlasting cov-
                   enant to His people. Like peals of loudest thunder His words roll
                   through the earth. The Israel of God stand listening, with their
                   eyes fixed upward. Their countenances are lighted up with His
                   glory, and shine as did the face of Moses when he came down
                   from Sinai. The wicked cannot look upon them. And when the
                   blessing is pronounced on those who have honored God by
                   keeping His Sabbath holy, there is a mighty shout of victory."—
                   The Great Controversy, p. 640.

                     How is the approach of the King of kings described?

                      "Soon there appears in the east a small black cloud, about
                   half the size of a man's hand. It is the cloud which surrounds the
                   Saviour and which seems in the distance to be shrouded in
                   darkness. The people of God know this to be the sign of the Son
                   of man. In solemn silence they gaze upon it as it draws nearer
                   the earth, becoming lighter and more glorious, until it is a great
                   white cloud, its base a glory like consuming fire, and above it the
                   rainbow of the covenant. Jesus rides forth as a mighty con-
                   queror. Not now a 'Man of Sorrows,' to drink the bitter cup of
                   shame and woe, He comes, victor in heaven and earth, to judge
                   the living and the dead.... With anthems of celestial melody the
                   holy angels, a vast, unnumbered throng, attend Him on His way.
                   The firmament seems filled with radiant forms—'ten thousand
                   times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands.' No human
                   pen can portray the scene; no mortal mind is adequate to con-
                   ceive its splendor. . . . As the living cloud comes still nearer,
                   every eye beholds the Prince of life. No crown of thorns now
                   mars that sacred head; but a diadem of glory rests on His holy
                   brow. His countenance outshines the dazzling brightness of the
                   noonday sun. 'And He hath on His vesture and on His thigh a
                   name written, King of kings, and Lord of lords.' Revelation

         Part 4   What will be the joyous exclamation of the children of God
     FOUR GREAT when death is swallowed up in victory at the advent?
        EVENTS
                  "He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will
                wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his
                people shall he take away from off all the earth: for the Lord
                hath spoken it. And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our
                God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is the
                Lord; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his
                salvation" (Isa. 25:8, 9).

                     What are the great events that will take place at the time of
                   Jesus' coming?

                      1. General resurrection of the righteous (1 Thess. 4:15-17).
                   This is the general resurrection of the saved after the partial one
                   that occurred earlier.
                      2. Glorification of the living saints (1 Cor. 15:51, 52).
                      3. Both groups are caught up to meet the Lord (1 Thess.
                   4:17).
                      4. The wicked living are destroyed (2 Thess. 2:8).
                      This is how the pen of inspiration describes these events:
                      "Amid the reeling of the earth, the flash of lightning, and the
                   roar of thunder, the voice of the Son of God calls forth the
                   sleeping saints. He looks upon the graves of the righteous, then,
                   raising His hands to heaven, He cries: 'Awake, awake, awake, ye
                   that steep in the dust, and arise!' Throughout the length and
                   breadth of the earth the dead shall hear that voice, and they that
                   hear shall live. And the whole earth shall ring with the tread of
                   the exceeding great army of every nation, kindred, tongUe, and
                   people. . . .
                      "The living righteous are changed 'in a moment, in the twin-
                   kling of an eye.' At the voice of God they were glorified; now they
                   are made immortal and with the risen saints are caught up to
                   meet their Lord in the air. Angels 'gather together His elect from
                   the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.' Little
                   children are borne by holy angels to their mothers' arms.
                   Friends long separated by death are united, nevermore to part,
                   and with songs of gladness ascend together to the City of
                   God."—The Great Controversy, pp. 644, 645.

THINK IT THROUGH     Have I ever really stopped to think about myself being
                   caught up in the clouds in heaven, following Jesus to the
                   celestial city? Did I ever imagine myself being in this real and
                   most happy situation? What kind of feelings did it arouse in
                   me toward God and Jesus?

             Part 5   What is the reason the redeemed can be part of Christ's
       TOWARD THE kingdom?
      PEARLY GATES
                      "Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his
                    own blood, and hath made us kings and priests unto God and
                    his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever"
                    (Rev. 1:5, 6).

                       What does the Saviour bestow upon His followers before
                     entering the city of God?

                        "On each side of the cloudy chariot are wings, and beneath it
                     are living wheels; and as the chariot rolls upward, the wheels
                     cry, 'Holy,' and the wings, as they move, cry, 'Holy,' and the
                     retinue of angels cry, 'Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty.' And
                     the redeemed shout, 'Alleluia!' as the chariot moves onward
                     toward the New Jerusalem.
                        "Before entering the City of God, the Saviour bestows upon
                     His followers the emblems of victory and invests them with the
                     insignia of their royal state. The glittering ranks are drawn up in
                     the form of a hollow square about their King, whose form rises
                     in majesty high above saint and angel, whose countenance
                     beams upon them full of benignant love. Throughout the un-
                     numbered host of the redeemed every glance is fixed upon Him,
                     every eye beholds His glory whose 'visage was so marred more
                     than any man, and His form more than the sons of men.' Upon
                     the heads of the overcomers, Jesus with His own right hand
                    places the crown of glory. For each there is a crown, bearing his
                    own 'new name' (Revelation 2:17), and the inscription, 'Holi-
                    ness to the Lord.' . . .
                       "Before the ransomed throng is the Holy City. Jesus opens
                    wide the pearly gates, and the nations that have kept the truth
                    enter in. There they behold the Paradise of God, the home of
                    Adam in his innocency. Then that voice, richer than any music
                    that ever fell on mortal ear, is heard, saying: 'Your conflict is
                    ended."Come, ye blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom
                    prepared for you from the foundation of the world.' "—The
                    Great Controversy, pp. 645, 646.
                       "Jesus raised His mighty, glorious arm, laid hold of the pearly
                    gate, swung it back on its glittering hinges, and said to us, 'You
                    have washed your robes in My blood, stood stiffly for My truth,
                    enter in.' We all marched in and felt that we had a perfect right in
                    the city."—Early Writings, p. 17.

THINK IT THROUGH      What do I learn from the fact that on the crown that Christ
                    gives to every victor there is written a new name and the
                    inscription: "Holiness to the Lord"? How can I acquire this
                    new name?

    HOW TO MAKE the glorious meeting with Christ and all the saints in the city of
     SURE OF OUR God?
    PARTICIPATION
                     "They overcame him [Satan] by the blood of the Lamb, and
                   by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives
                   unto the death" (Rev. 12:11).

                      God never asks us to do anything for which He has not made
                    ample provision. God is far above our enemy, and He has pro-
                    vided for our complete success.
                      But a constant fight is going on. The devil does not give up
                    easily. As long as we live, we have to behave as good soldiers of
                    Jesus; we must be valiant and take full advantage of the means
                    of grace that God has put at our disposal.

                      What is the human part in the plan of salvation? James 4:7,
                    last part.

                      "Sanctification is not the work of a moment, an hour, a day,
                    but a lifetime. It is not gained by a happy flight of feeling, but is
                    the result of constantly dying to sin, and constantly living for
                    Christ. Wrongs cannot be righted nor reformations wrought in
                    the character by feeble, intermittent efforts. It is only by long,
                    persevering effort, sore discipline, and stern conflict, that we
                    shall overcome."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 560.

                       What must accompany the resisting of the devil? James 4:7,
                    first part.

                      Submission, surrender to God is the human part. It is impos-
                    sible to defeat the devil with our own efforts. Christ has to do it
                    for us, but He needs our cooperation.

                      On the other hand, in light of the last part of John 15:5, what
                    should we beware of?

                       "The Lord does nothing without our cooperation. When
                    Christ prayed, Father, keep them in Thy name, He did not mean
                    that we should neglect to keep ourselves in the love and faith of
                    God. Alive unto God, through a living union with Christ, we trust
                    in the promises, constantly gaining greater strength by behold-
                    ing Jesus."—Selected Messages, bk. 2, p. 236.

 THINK IT THROUGH      How completely do I depend of the power of God and on the
                    work of the Holy Spirit in my life? Have I learned how, by a
                    living faith in Jesus, to avail myself of His promise of making
                    me a partaker of the divine nature?

in a mighty way is undoubtedly of
great importance. Nevertheless,
knowledge will not do us much good
if it does not lead us to a thorough
spiritual preparation that would
enable us to stand in the great day
of God and finally meet the Lord with
peace and joy.
    The church of God at large is going
to be victorious one of these days. But
the plan of God is that every one of
us should achieve victory in his own
life, so that he may be identified with
the triumphant people of God.
     The tendency now is to be deceived
 regarding ourselves, to be lulled by
 a deadly stupor. This is the natural
 condition of Laodicea. But God wants
 every one of us to get rid of this
 lethal condition, similar to a physical
 state of coma. The end is very near.
 "The 'time of trouble, such as never
 was,' " writes the servant of God,
 "is soon to open upon us; and we
 shall need an experience which we do
 not now possess and which many are

                                                                           June 24

           Part 1     What is the vital importance and necessity of having a
 AN EXPERIENTIAL    knowledge of God and of Christ?
     KNOWLEDGE
                     "This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true
                    God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent" (John 17:3).

                       Having a theoretical knowledge of the Word of God without
                    feeling its tremendous effect on one's character is not enough
                    for salvation. Understanding the doctrines without allowing the
                    truth to act upon the life in order to transform it will not do much
                    good either. The only thing that brings eternal life is a direct,
                    personal, and experiential knowledge of God as our loving
                    Father and of Jesus Christ as our personal Saviour and Friend.
                       With many Christians religion seems to be participation in a
                    series of formal activities and acceptance of a set of doctrines.
                    Unfortunately, even in our church there are many members who
                    go through the forms and who comply with the external acts of
                    worship. But they have not yet attained a firsthand knowledge of
                    and a loving, personal, daily relationship with God and with
                    Christ His Son. This knowledge and this relationship are sorely
                    needed.

                      What does the Lord say is to be the reason for glorying? Jer.
                    9:23, 24.

                       "This knowledge [of the loving-kindness and righteousness
                    of God] is the foundation of all true education and of all true
                    service. It is the only real safeguard against temptation; and it is
                    this alone that can make one like God in character. Through the
                    knowledge of God and of His Son Jesus Christ, are given to the
                    believer 'all things that pertain unto life and godliness.' . . .
                       ". . Scarcely can the human mind comprehend the breadth
                    and depth and height of the spiritual attainments of him who
                    gains this knowledge."—The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 530, 531.

THINK IT THROUGH     In what ways do I have a superficial spiritual experience?
                    How can I experience a closer relationship with Christ?

                      "The experimental knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ
                    whom He has sent, transforms man into the image of God. It
                    gives to man the mastery of himself, bringing every impulse and
                    passion of the lower nature under the control of the higher
                    powers of the mind. It makes its possessor a son of God and an
                    heir of heaven. It brings him into communion with the mind of
                    the Infinite, and opens to him the rich treasures of the
                    universe."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 114.

                                                                             June 25

           Part 2     What is the real essence of the gospel of Jesus and the plan
     A PERSONAL     of salvation?
    RELATIONSHIP
                      "Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from
                    generations, but now is made manifest to his saints: to whom
                    God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this
                    mystery among the Gentiles: which is Christ in you, the hope
                    of glory" (Col. 1:26, 27).

                      "Christ in you" is a very simple and wonderful formula for
                    attaining the highest spiritual stature. When He is in us, filling
                    our mind, living in our heart, He will be manifesting His charac-
                    ter, speaking His words, thinking His thoughts, living His life in
                    us. No human science, no psychology can explain it. It is a
                    mystery. Nevertheless, when we allow Christ to be in us, and
                    when we are in Him, the miracle begins to happen. And it keeps
                    on happening as long as this real union between the heart and
                    God exists.

                      With what appropriate and simple natural fact did Christ try
                    to illustrate this same great truth? John 15:4, 5.

                       In order for the branch to bear fruit, it has to grow on the vine.
                    It must be a part of the vine. As soon as the branch is severed
                    from the vine, the branch dies. The same happens to us if our
                    union with Christ, the true Vine, is severed.
                       "Will we put forth most earnest efforts to form this alliance
                    with Christ, through which alone these blessings are attained?
                    Will we break off our sins by righteousness and our iniquities by
                    turning unto the Lord? Skepticism and infidelity are wide-
                    spread. Christ asked the question: 'When the Son of man com-
                    eth, shall He find faith on the earth?' We must cherish a living,
                    active faith. The permanence of our faith is the condition of our
                    union."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 231.

                      In what other illustration did Jesus emphasize our need of
                    being constantly in close relationship with Him to attain vic-
                    tory in our Christian life? John 6:33, 35, 48.

                      When bread is eaten, it becomes part of the body, providing
                    nourishment to sustain a person's life. It is likewise with Christ
                    When He is received in human life and abides there, He gives
                    spiritual life and strength.

THINK IT THROUGH      Since this Bread that came down from heaven is available
                    to every person, why is it that so many do not receive any
                    benefit from it?

           Part 3    To what extent Is Jesus to take over the life of the believer?
         CHRIST'S
       RULERSHIP     "I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live,
      OF OUR LIFE but Christ who lives in me; and the life I now live in the flesh I
                  live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself
                  for me" (Gal. 2:20, RSV).

                       One of the great deceptions of Satan is to induce us to strug-
                     gle, by our own efforts, to overcome sin in our life. But our only
                     hope is Christ. When we let Him take over in our life, He brings
                     victory to our sin-sick souls.
                       "Each one will have a close struggle to overcome sin in his
                     own heart. This is at times a very painful and discouraging work;
                     because, as we see the deformities in our character, we keep
                     looking at them, when we should look to Jesus and put on the
                     robe of His righteousness. Everyone who enters the pearly
                     gates of the city of God will enter there as a conqueror, and his
                     greatest conquest will have been the conquest of self."—
                    Testimonies, vol. 9, pp. 182, 183.
                       "As long as Satan reigns we shall have self to subdue, beset-
                     ments to overcome, and there is no stopping place."—Ellen G.
                     White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 947.
                       The apostle says: "I have been crucified with Christ." Self has
                    died. The throne of my heart has been vacated. The self has
                    been denied. "It is no longer I who live," he adds, "but Christ
                     who lives in me" (Gal. 2:20; RSV). Once I have vacated the
                    throne of my heart and surrendered completely to Him, plead-
                    ing with Him to be the Ruler of my life, then He comes and lives
                    in me. What a wonderful transfer of rulership! He brings along
                    with Him His love, His joy, His peace, His patience, His long-
                    suffering, His gentleness, His goodness, His faith, His meek-
                    ness, His self-control, and my life changes completely. It be-
                    comes a real, happy, and peaceful life; it becomes a godly life; it
                    becomes a victorious life.
                       The final statement of the verse is: "And the life I now live in
                    the flesh [my daily, practical, everyday life), I live by faith in the
                    Son of God." By faith I appropriate the victory. (See 1 John 5:4). I
                    do not look into myself, into my weaknesses and deformities. I
                    look to Jesus, and by faith I accept the character of Jesus, which
                    actually is incorporated into my being, changing my whole
                    behavior—my feelings, my thoughts, my intentions. Christ now
                    lives His life in me.

THINK IT THROUGH      How would this change of rulership in my own life affect the
                    church as a whole? How would a spiritual renewal of this kind
                    affect fellow members of the family of God?

                                                                     June 27

          Part 4     What is the experience symbolized in Revelation 3:20?
    THE ROLE OF
     THE WILL—       "Behold, I stand at the door, and knock; if any man hear my
     SURRENDER     voice, and open the door, I will come into him, and will sup with
                   him, and he with me" (Rev. 3:20).

                      God has made man a free moral entity, in His own image. Man
                   is responsible for his own acts. He is free because he has the
                   right and the ability to choose. God never forces the will. He will
                   never save us unless we desire to be saved. This is the opposite
                   of the way used by Satan.

                    How do other scriptures emphasize the vital role of the will?
                   Deut. 30:19; Matt. 16:24.

                     "Choose life." The only one who can choose for me is myself.
                   God has given me this freedom of choice; and, if it is rightly
                   used, no one has the right to deprive me of it.
                     "Let him deny himself" and decide to turn to Jesus. This is
                   really the only part the human being has in his own salvation.
                     The will, in the biblical sense, is not the power of changing our
                   own habits and our life, but the power of choice.
                     The spirit of prophecy explains the role of the human will in
                   conversion and the plan of salvation thus:
                     "Many are inquiring, 'How am I to make the surrender of
                   myself to God?' You desire to give yourself to Him, but you are
                   weak in moral power, in slavery to doubt, and controlled by the
                   habits of your life of sin. Your promises and resolutions are like
                   ropes of sand. You cannot control your thoughts, your im-
                   pulses, your affections. The knowledge of your broken prom-
                   ises and forfeited pledges weakens your confidence in your
                   own sincerity, and causes you to feel that God cannot accept
                   you; but you need not despair. What you need to understand is
                   the true force of the will. This is the governing power in the
                   nature of man, the power of decision, or of choice. Everything
                   depends on the right action of the will. The power of choice God
                   has given to men; it is theirs to exercise. You cannot change
                   your heart, you cannot of yourself give to God its affections; but
                   you can choose to serve Him. You can give Him your will; He will
                   then work in you to will and to do according to His good plea-
                   sure. Thus your whole nature will be brought under the control
                   of the Spirit of Christ; your affections will be centered upon Him,
                   your thoughts will be in harmony with Him."—Steps to Christ,
                   p. 47.

              Part 5    According to Jesus' words, what is the great source of
          THE GREAT spiritual life for the child of God?
      SOURCE OF LIFE
                        "It is the spirit that gives life, the flesh is of no avail; the
                     words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life" (John 6:63,
                     RSV).
                        Jesus had spoken of Himself as the bread of life (John 6:33,
                     35, 50, 51) in order to convey the idea that He is the only way of
                     salvation and life eternal. And then, to emphasize this thought,
                     He said: "He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal
                     life" (verse 54, RSV). But when some of the disciples did not
                     understand what He meant and began to take offense, He has-
                     tened to explain it further: "It is the spirit that gives life, the flesh,
                     is of no avail; the words that I have spoken to you are spirit and
                     life."
                        A close contact with Jesus through the words He spoke has
                     the power to give spiritual life and produce Christian growth
                     and maturity. When we open the Bible or the spirit of prophecy
                     with an open heart—reading and meditating on them, trying to
                     apply the messages to our own individual life—the Holy Spirit
                     makes a deep impression on our minds. He shows us more
                     clearly our spiritual needs. He makes more real the unfailing
                     promises of God. He strengthens our faith. He arouses in us the
                     desire to be like our blessed Master and prepares us to pray
                     more meaningfully and fervently. A spiritual hunger and thirst,
                     produced by the active power of the Holy Spirit, adds more
                     strength and power to our prayers.

                           In what other way does Jesus illustrate the tremendous
                         effect of the study and meditation of His Word? John 15:7.

                          Jesus had talked about the need for human beings to abide in
                        Him and He in them. This is the only way we can bear fruit. Then
                        He goes on to clarify that statement with verse 7: "If ye abide in
                        me, and my words abide in you."
                          The way forJesus to abide in our hearts is by letting His words
                        enter our hearts. While we spend precious moments with the
                        open Word of God or with the testimonies of His Spirit, we are
                        communicating with Heaven. We have our hearts open to the
                        influence of the Spirit, since the Word is "the sword of the
                        Spirit."
                          There is no way of knowing God or His Son in a personal way
                        aside from the study of the Word and meditation on it. This Word
                        speaks to our hearts with heavenly power. It conveys to us the
                        knowledge of God and of Christ; it nourishes our soul and gives
                        us the actual life of Christ.

THINK IT THROUGH           How can I find more time for the study of the Bible?

                                                                         June 29

         Part 6      Why is the believer to watch and pray?
    PRAYER AND
  WATCHFULNESS       "Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit
                   indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak" (Matt. 26:41).

                      No spiritual house of a child of God could be devoid of the
                   garden of prayer. No day of a victorious Christian could possibly
                   begin without a quiet visit to that wonderful garden, where the
                   soul meets with God.
                      There, in the quiet morning hour, we open our hearts to God.
                   We praise His name and let our feelings of gratitude pour forth
                   in a simple way. We thank Him for the many blessings He
                   bestows upon us, and especially for the wonderful gift of His
                   Son. We ask forgiveness for our sins, and by faith we receive
                   right there the cleansing from sin, and we are clothed in the
                   white robes of Christ's imputed righteousness.
                      There we acknowledge our spiritual deformities, our weak-
                   nesses, and our defects of character. Longing to receive in our
                   life the power of the indwelling Christ, we ask for the baptism of
                   the Holy Spirit, in order for Him to cleanse our life, soften our
                   mood, purify our thoughts, and fill us with love, patience, good-.
                   ness, gentleness, and meekness.
                      There, at the foot of the cross, praying with faith, looking to
                   our wonderful Saviour and trusting in His promises, we receive
                   grace enough to live the Christian life that day. We receive by
                   faith the imparted righteousness of Christ.
                      There we make intercession for our loved ones, for our fellow
                   workers, for our neighbors, for the leaders of our cause, and for
                   the people for whom we are working. There we again commit
                   ourselves to God; we surrender our hearts to Him; and we leave
                   our helpless souls in His tender care.
                      Aday begun with an hour of personal study of the Word and of
                   quiet and intimate talking with God will be a day of strength.
                       "By prayer, by the study of His word, by faith in His abiding
                   presence, the weakest of human beings may live in contact with
                   the living Christ, and He will hold them by a hand that will never
                   let go."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 182.
                       "Consecrate yourself to God in the morning; make this your
                   very first work. Let your prayer be, 'Take me, 0 Lord, as wholly
                   Thine. I lay my plans at Thy feet. Use me today in Thy service.
                    Abide with me, and let all my work be wrought in Thee.... Thus
                    day by day you may be giving your life into the hands of God, and
                    thus your life will be molded more and more after the life of
                   Christ."—Steps to Christ, p. 70.
