Don't overlook
  the facts
The fact is—some child may never find Jesus unless
someone introduces him to the Saviour.
The Branch Sabbath School offers the opportunity to
cooperate in this rewarding venture.

            Dear Sabbath School Members:

            Church growth in Southern Asia has been extraordinary during the
            past decade and a half, with a membership increase of 400%.

            Of the new members, over 30% are youth. Obviously, these youth
            will one day constitute the "backbone" of the church.

            For years our Division has had only one training center (Spicer
            Memorial College). Now, with church growth and international
            travel restrictions, the need for regional training centers is
            imperative. Consequently, it has been voted that this quarter's
            Thirteenth Sabbath Offering support the following projects:

            We request you especially to remember Southern Asia in prayer;
            secondly, to give liberally, as God has blessed you, that our
            youth may be equipped for the future.

                                         Introduction

    Last quarter, under the general title of "The Last Hour," we reviewed in some detail the
dramatic events that, according to Bible prophecy, are about to take place in our world and
in our church. We saw the tremendous social, political, and religious impact that they are
going to make on society as a whole as well as on the people of God. In fact, some of these
climactic happenings are in process right now, and we are beginning to feel their effects.
    The lessons of last quarter emphasized the thought that the greatest crisis ever to confront
the church of God need not bring it desperation or confusion.
    On the contrary, God has made provision for every member of His family on earth to be
shielded by the power of heaven. They will be accompanied by Jesus, the angels, and the
Holy Spirit. They will march safely through deception, temptation, and persecution, reaching
at last, by the grace of God, the final victory.
    The rapid unfolding of events in the fields of science, politics, economics, morality, and
religion, portrayed daily by press, radio, and television, gives evidence that we are living in
earth's last hours. The sun of grace and mercy is about to set forever; the short night that
precedes the glorious morning will soon commence.
    But along with the approaching end comes a responsibility to do the work of preaching
the gospel to all the world. God will give to us an extraordinary measure of divine power to
accomplish this task. This stimulates us to redouble our efforts, multiply our enthusiasm,
and rededicate our talents, to the finishing of the work.
    But what if the hour of the end catches us unready? What if the final hour of the world—or
 of our own lives—should overtake us as a thief in the night? What if we have not made the
 necessary spiritual preparation? Of what value, then, would be the knowledge of what will
 happen?
    This is why, during this quarter, we plan to study about our personal preparation for the
final crisis. We need to make our readiness sure for this time of crisis.
    In these lessons we shall note the message to Laodicea. We shall analyze the counsel of
 the True Witness. We consider the shaking of God's people. The revival and reformation
 through which God wants to take His church collectively—and every one of us
 individually—shall be another important subject of our study, followed by the all-important
 promise and entering into the experience of righteousness by faith.
    Then we discuss the sealing, the baptism of the Holy Spirit, and the latter rain. We examine
 their importance in finishing God's work. We study the conditions necessary to receive the
 showers of the Holy Spirit, and the need for a consecrated witnessing activity. It is our hope
 that this will strengthen us spiritually, will make us alive, and will motivate us to spread the
 light of God in a fast and miraculous way.
    Finally, we consider the specific ways of getting ready for the day of the Lord, giving
 attention to the steps we must take in our own life to make our readiness sure.
    The Lord longs for us to overcome our I u kewarmness and indifference, and to seek higher
 spiritual ground. He wants us to dedicate the necessary time to the study of His Word, and
  also to devote time to secret prayer and to the examination of our spiritual needs. He desires
  that every one of us may understand practically and experientially what the righteousness of
  Christ is. He wants us to claim the mighty work of His grace in conquering sin in our lives. He
  would have us make a full surrender and a total commitment. He would have us overcome
  our defects of character and reflect in our lives, always more perfectly, the image of Christ.
     May these lessons help us to acquire this experience and to be fully prepared to meet our
  Lord in peace and joy.

              Part 1     What message is given to the church in the last days?
         A MESSAGE
            OF LOVE      "Unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write;
                       These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the
                       beginning of the creation of God. I know thy works" (Rev. 3:14,
                       15).

                         The apostle John sent these messages to seven churches in
                       Asia Minor. These local congregations had the characteristics
                       depicted in their respective messages. At the same time, these
                       letters have a wider significance. These local churches repre=
                       sent the church of God at large during seven periods of time.
                       Laodicea is the last epoch, the one in which we live.
                         "The message to the church of the Laodiceans is a startling
                       denunciation, and is applicable to the people of God at the
                       present time."—Testimonies, vol. 3, p. 252.

                         How is the author of the message described? Rev. 3:14.

                          All the titles given here belong to Christ. "Amen" is a Hebrew
                       word meaning "surely," from a root meaning "to be firm,
                       steady, trustworthy." Jesus used the word frequently to indicate
                       his authority. When He makes a promise, it will undoubtedly be
                       fulfilled. As a witness He is faithful and true, so that we can
                       always depend on Him. Indeed He is the beginning or source of
                       the creation of God, that is, the one through whom all things
                       were made. (See John 1:3.)
                         When we receive a letter from a dear friend, we eagerly read it
                       to know what it says. Since Jesus Himself is the Author of this
                       letter, how much more important it is for us to study it!

                         What does Christ say that He knows about us? Rev. 3:15.

                         He knows all about us, our feelings—our intentions, our
                       thoughts, our behavioral patterns. He knows even the things we
                       count trivial, such as the number of hairs on our head. (See
                       Matt. 10:30.)
                         Unfortunately we human beings do not know our inner selves
                       as well as we ought. This is why a true witness, a faithful friend,
                       who knows us intimately and who can read our hearts as an
                       open book, is especially helpful and His message should be
                       particularly welcome.

THINK IT THROUGH         In view of the fact that Jesus knows so much about us, how
                       should we relate to Him?

The Present Condition of the Church              LESSON 1             ❑ Monday
                                                                         July 2
       Part 2  How vividly does Jesus describe the condition of the Laodi-
 LUKEWARMNESS cean church?

                     "Thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot.
                   So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I
                   will spue thee out of my mouth" (Rev. 3:15, 16).

                      "The greater part [of the people of God who profess present
                   truth] are lukewarm professors, having a name but no zeal....
                   The term 'lukewarm' is applicable to this class. They profess to
                   love the truth, yet are deficient in Christian fervor and devotion.
                   They dare not give up wholly and run the risk of the unbeliever,
                   yet they are unwilling to die to self and follow out closely the
                   principles of their faith. . . .
                      "... They do not engage thoroughly and heartily in the work of
                   God, identifying themselves with its interests; but they hold
                   aloof and are ready to leave their posts when their worldly
                   personal interests demand it. The internal work of grace is
                   wanting in their hearts."—Testimonies, vol. 4, pp. 87, 88.
                      Note the elements that make up this lukewarmness:
                      1.Deficiency in "Christian fervor and devotion." We need to
                   live a life of daily communion with God, a life of study of the
                   Word and of prayer. In this way we can satisfy our spiritual
                   needs through the power of God—an urgent need.
                      2. Unwillingness to "die to self and follow out closely the
                   principles of their faith." "Turn ye even to me with all your
                   heart" (Joel 2:12), says the Lord. A divided heart will not give us
                   victory. "He that is not with me is against me: and he that
                   gathereth not with me scattereth" (Luke 11:23). The warfare in
                    which we are engaged has no neutral position. Christ requires
                   complete possession. Self must die in order for Christ to reign
                   on the throne of the heart.
                      3. Not engaging "thoroughly and heartily in the work of God,
                   identifying themselves with its interests." Many do not dedicate
                   sufficient time or interest, work or means in order to finish the
                    work of God.
                      4. "The internal work of grace [sanctification] is wanting in
                   their hearts." God desires to perform a miracle of grace in every
                   heart. "He which hath begun a good work in you," says Paul,
                    "will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ" (Phil. 1:6). Thank
                   God He is able to do it. But our consent is necessary. We must
                    give Him our hearty cooperation.


THINK IT THROUGH      If lukewarmness is a description that fits my life, how should
                   I go about changing my relationship with Christ?

The Present Condition of the Church                  LESSON 1            ❑ Tuesday
                                                                             July 3
              Part 3     How does Jesus feel about lukewarm people?
            INSIPID
         CHRISTIANS      "I will spue thee out of my mouth" (Rev. 3:16).

                          Modern English versions have the word "spit" for "spue." It
                        indicates an action used when something is distasteful. We
                        should read here a mere prophecy or a promise that Christ will
                       spit His church out of His mouth. We see how Jesus presently
                       feels about those who are lukewarm and what action is inevita-
                       ble if they reject His counsel to change. Those who are
                       lukewarm cannot expect any other kind of treatment.
                          Warm water is very distasteful. It can sometimes be used as an
                       emetic. Administered to some people, it can make them vomit. If
                       this does not happen spontaneously, the warm water may still
                       assist in inducing vomiting.
                          By contrast, nothing can be more acceptable than a cold
                       drink on a hot day or a hot drink on a cold day.
                          "It would be more pleasing to the Lord if lukewarm professors
                       of religion had never named His name. They are a continual
                       weight to those who would be faithful followers of Jesus. They
                       are a stumbling block to unbelievers."—Testimonies, vol. 1, p.
                       188.
                          Jesus sorrows over lukewarmness and spiritual mediocrity.
                       He expresses His fervent desire that the situation might change.
                       The severity of the divine denunciation is intended to arouse us
                       to a reformation of life, to cause a change so marked that it will
                       reveal the deep and converting work of the grace of Christ.
                          None of us needs to remain lukewarm. None need be spit out
                       of the mouth of Christ.

THINK IT THROUGH         What happens to individuals who persist in their lukewarm-
                       ness?

                         "Individuals are tested and proved a length of time to see if
                       they will sacrifice their idols and heed the counsel of the True
                       Witness. If any will not be purified through obeying the truth,
                       and overcome their selfishness, their pride, and evil passions,
                       the angels of God have the charge: 'They are joined to their
                       idols, let them alone,' and they pass on to their work, leaving
                       these with their sinful traits unsubdued, to the control of evil
                       angels."—Testimonies, vol. 1, p. 187.

The Present Condition of the Church               LESSON 1 ❑ Wednesday
                                                                 July 4
          Part 4   How do some Christians feel about their spiritual condition?
      SPIRITUAL
          SELF-    "Thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have
    SATISFACTION need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and
                 miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked. . . . Be zealous
                 therefore, and repent" (Rev. 3:17-19).

                      It will be profitable to take each one of the conditions in verse
                   17 and try to understand its meaning in the context:
                      Rich: Does this refer to a bank balance? Where is the only
                   bank where riches can be safe? How does one make deposits in
                   the bank of heaven? (See Matt. 6:19-21.)
                      Increased with goods: Is it wrong to have plenty of this
                   world's goods? What attitude should we have toward wealth?
                   (See Luke 12:22.) Or what is the problem with being spiritually
                   self-satisfied?
                      Have need of nothing: What kind of people feel that they do
                   not need anything? For what element are we constantly depen-
                   dent upon God? (See Acts 17:28; Phil. 1:21.)
                       Now look at the words which describe the actual condition of
                   those who are self-satisfied with their condition:
                       Wretched: How would you describe a wretched person? How
                   can a person be rich and wretched at the same time? (See
                   James 5:1-6; Rom. 7:25.)
                       Miserable: This word really means "an object of pity."—
                   Marvin R. Vincent.Word Studies in the New Testament, vol. 2, p.
                   471. The self-satisfied person is not aware of his own condition
                   and therefore is "pitiable."
                       Poor-blind-naked: Here is a string of descriptive words that
                   emphasizes the real condition of the self-satisfied person. He
                    thinks he is rich when he is poor; he thinks he can see, but he is
                    blind; and he thinks he is beautifully adorned when he is actu-
                    ally naked.
                       "The message to the Laodiceans is applicable to Seventh-day
                    Adventists who have had great light and have not walked in the
                    light. It is those who have made great profession, but have not
                    kept in step with their Leader, that will be spewed out of His
                    mouth unless they repent."—Selected Messages, bk. 2, p. 66.
                       Here are some of the ways in which I may be self-deceived and
                    full of self-contentment and self-righteousness: (1) trusting in
                    my fulfillment of the external acts of worship and in my partici-
                    pation in the activities of the church; (2) trusting in my condition
                    as a member of the church—a united, well-organized, strong,
                    and growing church; (3) trusting in my knowledge and under-
                    standing of the wonderful system of biblical doctrines.

The Present Condition of the Church                    LESSON 1            ❑ Thursday
                                                                                July 5
              Part 5   What is the beautiful epilogue of the message to the Laodi-
            CHRIST ceans?
       AT THE DOOR
                       "Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my
                     voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with
                     him, and he with me" (Rev. 3:20).

                          Read also verses 21, 22.
                          In the whole Bible probably there is not a more beautiful
                       picture painted than this of Christ standing at the door of the
                       human heart, knocking and waiting to enter in and to bless the
                       life with His wonderful and abiding presence.
                          But the crux of the matter is that regardless of Christ's will-
                       ingness and eagerness to enter our lives, He will not do it if we
                       do not decide to open the door and invite Him in.
                          Our will, the power of choice, will finally decide what the
                       outcome is going to be. He will not force us. He will not save us
                       against our desire and choice.

                         After Jesus walked with the two disciples who were going
                       toward Emmaus, what did they do and with what results? Luke
                       24:28, 29.

                        "Had the disciples failed to press their invitation, they would
                      not have known that their traveling companion was the risen
                      Lord. Christ never forces His company upon anyone. He inter-
                      ests Himself in those who need Him. Gladly will He enter the
                      humblest home, and cheer the lowliest heart. But if men are too
                      indifferent to think of the heavenly Guest, or ask Him to abide
                      with them, He passes on. Thus many meet with great loss."—
                      The Desire of Ages, p. 800.

                        In what tender words does God present His loving invitation
                      to surrender all our life to Him? Prov. 23:26.

                         "It is for you to yield up your will to the will ofJesus Christ; and
                      as you do this, God will immediately take possession and work
                      in you to will and to do of His good pleasure. Your whole nature
                      will then be brought under the control of the Spirit of Christ, and
                      even your thoughts will be subject to Him. .. . By yielding up
                      your will to Christ, your life will be hid with Christ in God and
                      allied to the power which is above all principalities and powers.
                      You will have strength from God that will hold you fast to His
                      strength; and a new light, even the light of living faith, will be
                      possible to you."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 514.

The Present Condition of the Church              LESSON 1               ❑ Friday
                                                                          July 6

          Part 6      How does Christ insist on the fact that unless there is a
  OUR RESPONSE      willingness on our part, the message will not accomplish any
                    good?

                      "He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto
                    the churches" (Rev. 3:22).

                       No one is so deaf as the one who will not hear. The apostle
                    Paul prophesied about people who will "turn away their ears
                    from the truth" (2 Tim. 4:4). This has always been a very com-
                    mon human experience, and it continues to be so.
                       This stresses once more the need of our interest, of our
                    answer to the voice of God, of our cooperation with the plan and
                    the will of God for our salvation.
                       Procrastination, the postponement of our response, is always
                    dangerous because it hardens our heart and our ears to the
                    sweet voice of the Spirit, who is pleading with us.

                      How does Christ stress the fact that knowledge only is not
                    enough? Matt. 7:24-27.

                       "A mere profession of discipleship is of no value. The faith in
                    Christ which saves the soul is not what it is represented to be by
                    many. 'Believe, believe,' they say, 'and you need not keep the
                    law.' But a belief [or a knowledge] that does not lead to obedi-
                    ence is presumption. The apostle John says, 'He that saith, I
                    know Him, and keepeth not His commandments, is a liar, and
                    the truth is not in him.' 1 John 2:4."—Thoughts From the Mount
                    of Blessing, p. 146.
                       We have been privileged by the abundant wealth of knowl-
                    edge contained in the Word of God, which we may understand
                    by study under the Spirit's guidance. Besides the understand-
                    ing of the Bible and the accumulated research made by our
                    forefathers under the leadership of the Holy Spirit, besides the
                    work of all our own godly researchers and theologians to enrich
                     our understanding of the Scriptures, we have had the inestima-
                     ble gift of the spirit of prophecy, which has widely enlarged our
                     horizons.
                       There is no excuse, then, for lack of action on our part, no
                     excuse for lukewarmness or lack of interest in our spiritual
                     well-being, no excuse for a lack of a real and practical experi-
                     ence with God and with Christ.

 THINK IT THROUGH     What is a practical and specific way of evaluating our prog-
                    ress, our faith, and our Christian experience?

                      "When benevolence, kindness, tenderheartedness, sym-

We may be very happy that the divine

                                                                             July 8
           Part 1 What are the first words of Christ in the remedial part of the
 "I COUNSEL THEE message to Laodicea?
   TO BUY OF ME"
                  "I counsel thee to buy of me" (Rev. 3:18).

                       Why does Christ use the verb "to buy" when He refers to
                     spiritual things?
                       We buy only those things to which we attach some value. To
                     buy means to pay a certain price, usually an amount of money.
                     But money means time, work, and effort put forth in order to
                     earn it. We are willing to trade our money only when we are
                     really interested in having something, and that something
                     should be really worthwhile.

                       How do we acquire spiritual blessings? Isa. 55:1.

                        Wine and milk were some of the most appreciated products in
                     the Orient. They represent the most precious blessings of salva-
                     tion. But human beings can buy these goods "without money."
                     Otherwise God would be very partial and unjust, since money is
                     unevenly distributed among people.

                        What pleading terms does Christ use to describe the salva-
                     tion which He freely offers? Rev. 22:17.

                       Every one of us pays a price in order to avail himself of Jesus
                     and His wonderful goods—by interest and effort put forth, by
                     decision taken and sustained, by surrender made continually.

                       How does the apostle Paul point out the price the Christian
                     needs to pay? Phil. 2:12.

                       How did Jesus emphasize the need of paying a real price for
                     sanctification and salvation? Matt. 13:44-46.

                       The man who found the hidden treasure went and sold every-
                     thing he had and eagerly bought the field. The merchant, simi-
                     larly, who found the precious pearl went and disposed of all his
                     goods in order to purchase the pearl.

THINK IT THROUGH      What is the cost of salvation in a personal sense? Read
                     Matt. 16:24.

                       "We can receive of heaven's light only as we are willing to be
                     emptied of self. We cannot discern the character of God, or
                     accept Christ by faith, unless we consent to the bringing into
                     captivity of every thought to the obedience of Christ."—The

                                                                               July 9
           Part 2     What is the first of the three remedies offered by Christ?
   "GOLD TRIED IN
       THE FIRE"     "I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou
                    mayest be rich" (Rev. 3:18).

                       Every one of the remedies offered by the heavenly Physician
                    is specific and it changes the sad spiritual condition for which it
                    is administered to the sick Laodiceans.
                       Since the professed child of God has said: "I am rich," when
                    in reality he was "wretched, and miserable, and poor," the
                    "gold tried in the fire" will make him really rich.
                       According to Ellen White, what does gold represent in this
                    context?
                       "The gold here recommended as having been tried in the fire
                    is faith and love. It makes the heart rich; for it has been purged
                    until it is pure, and the more it is tested the more brilliant is its
                    luster."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 88.

                       In what Bible passage do we find these two virtues men-
                    tioned? Gal 5:22.

                       "Satan is constantly at work to remove these precious gifts
                    from the hearts of God's people. All are engaged in playing the
                    game of life. Satan is well aware that if he can remove love and
                    faith, and supply their place with selfishness and unbelief, all
                    the remaining precious traits will soon be skillfully removed by
                    his deceitful hand, and the game will be lost."—Testimonies,
                    vol. 2, pp. 36, 37.
                       Love is the first evidence of conversion. It cannot be de-
                    veloped by mere human effort. It is of heavenly origin, and only
                    the presence of Christ can fill our hearts with love. Only love can
                    replace selfishness and hatred, anger and envy, jealousy, self-
                    esteem and self-sufficiency. Love replaces them with kindness,
                    forbearance, humility, meekness, and a forgiving spirit. Love
                    dispels contention and strife. It produces peace, goodwill, and
                     joy. It eliminates fear and distrust.
                       Faith, along with love, establishes between us and God a link
                    so indestructible that nothing and nobody can break it, except
                     sin. It makes accessible to us the forgiveness of God and His
                     power to live the victorious life. Faith puts at our disposal the
                     fulfillment of all the promises of God. It is an active principle that
                     manifests itself in the life by a voluntary surrender to Christ and
                     obedience to the will of God.

 THINK IT THROUGH      How do you distinguish between the real and the counterfeit
                     in faith and love?

            Part 3     What is the appropriate clothing for the Christian?
 "WHITE RAIMENT"
                       "And white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that
                     the shame of thy nakedness do not appear" (Rev. 3:18).

                       What is symbolized by white raiment? Rev. 19:8.
                         "The white raiment is purity of character, the righteousness
                      of Christ imparted to the sinner. This is indeed a garment of
                      heavenly texture, that can be bought only of Christ for a life of
                      willing obedience."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 88.
                      A. The righteousness of Christ by which we are justified:
                        —Is the work of Jesus for us.
                        —Is received by faith in Jesus. (See Eph. 2:8, 9; Rom. 3:24;
                      5:1.)
                        —Is imputed—credited to our account—and granted freely,
                      immediately, and continuously.
                        —Provides our title to heaven, the only merit we can claim.
                        —Involves repentance, confession, and acceptance of Christ.
                        —Implies a complete surrender to God.
                     B. The righteousness of Christ by which we are sanctified:
                        —Is the work of the Holy Spirit in us.
                        —Is imparted through a gradual process of growth.
                        —Provides our fitness, or preparation, for heaven.
                        —Sanctifies us, imparts to us the character of Christ.
                        —Is received by faith and through surrender.
                        —Is also the righteousness of Christ—His character—not
                     ours. All merit belongs to Him.
                        The two processes are interrelated and inseparable. There
                     could not be one without the other. What we many times forget
                     is that the plan of God is not only forgiveness of sin but change
                     of life, victory, and obedience to the will of God. The faith that
                     secures pardon for us also works by love and purifies the soul.
                     (See Gal. 4:5.) There is not one day we can do without imputed
                     righteousness. On the other hand, imputed righteousness—
                     forgiveness—without the consequent reception of the charac-
                     ter of Christ (works, fruits) makes our faith void.
                        It is our privilege to be constantly with God through our faith
                     in Jesus, depending on Him every minute of our lives, both for
                     forgiveness and for victory. His plan for us is one of pardon for
                     sin, victory over sin, and growth in grace. Victory is also the
                     character of Christ in us, not ours; His work in our hearts, not
                     ours; His righteousness, not ours.

                       "It is the work of God in laying the glory of man in the dust,
                     and doing for man that which it is not in his power to do for
                     himself."—Testimonies to Ministers, p. 456.

The Heart of the Laodicean Message                LESSON 2 ❑ Wednesday
                                                                July 11

           Part 4     What is the third remedy offered by the heavenly Physician?
      "EYESALVE"
                      "And anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest
                    see" (Rev. 3:18).

                       One of the serious problems of the Laodiceans is that they are
                    blind (verse 17). The eyesalve is offered to cure blindness and
                    restore clear spiritual vision.
                       What is this eyesalve? "The eyesalve is that wisdom and grace
                    which enables us to discern between the evil and the good, and
                    to detect sin under any guise."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 88.
                       It is only the wisdom and grace given by the work of the Holy
                    Spirit in the heart that will enable us to see ourselves as we are
                    and as God sees us. It is only by the promptings of the Spirit that
                    we will be able to see clearly our sin and see it in all its sinful-
                    ness. The work of the Spirit, according to the promise of Christ,
                    is this: "When he is come, he will reprove the world of sin" (John
                    16:8).
                        The closer we get to Jesus, the sharper will be our concept of
                    the difference between the perfection of the Master and our
                    sinfulness. As the blackness of a spot becomes more evident
                     when it is placed beside something immaculately white, so the
                     more we acquaint ourselves with the beautiful and matchless
                     character of Christ, the more we will discover our unrighteous-.
                     ness and the need for our dependence on the justifying righ-
                     teousness of Jesus. Increasing awareness of our desperate
                     need will ensure for us the cleansing and the transforming
                     power of Christ, His blood, and His Spirit.
                        Only by beholding the glory and the beauty of the spotless life
                     of Jesus can we become like Him. Thus we become more sensi-
                     tive to the voice of God, more convinced of our need of Him,
                     more willing to let Him work in and through us.
                        What other related meaning can the eyesalve have?
                        "The eye is the sensitive conscience, the inner light, of the
                     mind. Upon its correct view of things the spiritual healthfulness
                     of the whole soul and being depends. The `eyesalve,' the Word
                      of God, makes the conscience smart under its application; for it
                      convicts of sin. But the smarting is necessary that the healing
                     may follow, and the eye be single to the glory of God. The sinner,
                      beholding himself in God's great moral looking glass, sees
                      himself as God views him, and exercises repentance toward
                      God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ."—Ellen G. White

             Part 5     What is an evidence that God loves us?
     "I REBUKE AND
          CHASTEN"      "As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten" (Rev. 3:19).

                          Christ opens the curtain to let us see the abundant provision
                       of His infinite love. He sends this rebuke because of His love and
                       His eternal plan to save us.
                          Like a loving father who cares so much for his children that he

                      •rimand that presents a true picture of our real condition.

                        What shows that we are true children of God? Heb. 12:5-8.

                         The formation of character, our fitness for heaven, makes
                      some correction, some chastisement, some trials necessary.
                      Nevertheless, the illustration should not be applied too literally,
                      because it is not actually God who sends us trials. Rather, He
                      permits us to suffer tribulation without intervening to prevent it.
                         But He is always watching very carefully to see that the fur-
                      nace in which the dross is melted away may not be hotter than
                      we can bear. When we are in difficult situations, God is with us
                      in a very special way. He does not leave us alone. 'When thou
                      passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the
                      rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through
                      the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle
                      upon thee" (Isa. 43:2).
                         Unfortunately people often become complacent and careless
                      when everything seems to be going fine and free from trouble.
                      But when tribulation comes, and sorrow and pain are their lot,
                      they turn to God for help.
                         Then the Spirit of God can speak tenderly to our hearts and
                      can show us our unrighteousness. Then a hunger and a thirst
                      for God develops, and we can hear His voice. Then repentance
                      and change can occur, and we emerge from the fires and the
                      waters of affliction with a new experience with God, a new
                      determination for our lives. In that spiritual climate revival and
                      reformation are worked by the Spirit of God.

THINK IT THROUGH        When afflictions, problems, frustrations, and perplexities
                      come into my life, how do I relate to them? What can they do
                      for me?

The Heart of the Laodicean Message                    LESSON 2                 ❑ Friday
                                                                                July 13

           Part 6       What is the final counsel of the heavenly Physician?
"BE ZEALOUS . . . ,
     AND REPENT"        "Be zealous therefore, and repent" (Rev. 3:19).

                          Repentance is the deep heartfelt response to the work of the
                      Holy Spirit in the life. "Repentance includes sorrow for sin and a
                      turning away from it. We shall not renounce sin unless we see its
                      sinfulness; until we turn away from it in heart, there will be no
                      real change in the life."—Steps to Christ, p. 23.
                          "When the heart yields to the influence of the Spirit of God,
                      the conscience will be quickened, and the sinner will discern
                      something of the depth and sacredness of God's holy law, the
                      foundation of His government in heaven and on earth. . . .
                      Conviction takes hold upon the mind and heart. The sinner has
                      a sense of the righteousness of Jehovah and feels the terror of
                      appearing, in his own guilt and uncleanness, before the
                      Searcher of hearts. He sees the love of God, the beauty of
                      holiness, the joy of purity; he longs to be cleansed and to be
                       restored to communion with Heaven."—Steps to Christ, p. 24.
                          Some Christians think that repentance takes place only in the
                       first steps of the Christian life. But repentance is an experience
                       that will characterize the life of the child of God every step of the
                       way until the end of the battle. Probably not one single day will
                       pass by without the need of repentance.
                          A second danger in understanding repentance is the idea that
                       something has to happen in the life, that some change must be
                       made by the sinner himself before he can go to Christ and
                       repent. Should the sinner wait until he has repented before
                       coming to Jesus? The answer is No. "If you see your sinfulness;
                       do not wait to make yourself better. . . . We must not wait for
                       stronger persuasions, for better opportunities, or for holier
                       tempers. We can do nothing of ourselves. We must come to
                        Christ just as we are."—Steps to Christ, p. 31.
                          What is the scope of the message to Laodicea?
                           It is not only a call to repentance and forgiveness, but it is also
                        an invitation to possess the character of Christ, His righteous-
                        ness, His holiness.

 THINK IT THROUGH        Why is it difficult to repent?

                         "Christ has given us no assurance that to attain perfection of
                      character is an easy matter. A noble, all-round character is not
                      inherited. It does not come to us by accident. A noble character
                      is earned by individual effort through the merits and grace of
                      Christ.... It is formed by hard, stern battles with self. Conflict
                      after conflict must be waged against hereditary tendencies."—

                                                                             July 15
          Part 1   In an hour of crisis in the life of Peter, what did Jesus reveal
 DESCRIPTION AND to His disciple?
      ESSENTIAL
      FEATURES     "The Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired
                 to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: but I have prayed
                 for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted,
                 strengthen thy brethren" (Luke 22:31, 32).

                         Peter needed this sifting, this bitter experience, in order to
                       become aware of his own condition, his weakness, and his
                      absolute need of Christ. Some time later, the once proud and
                      self-confident disciple learned how unstable and how cowardly
                      he really was, denying His Lord three times.
                         Jesus wanted to prevent the complete discouragement of
                      Peter; so He commanded Simon: "When thou art converted
                      ['When you have returned to me.' NIV] strengthen thy brethren."
                      These words proved encouraging to Peter after he had under-
                      gone the sifting. Jesus still waited for him to come back, to be
                      converted, and He still had an important work for him.
                         As in the case of Peter, so every child of God and the church
                      as a whole will undergo in these last days a special trial of faith.
                      Shaking, or sifting, has taken place in the past, but it will be
                      repeated near the end of time in a specific way.
                         "Shaking" or "sifting" is a figure of speech that designates
                      the particular experience of separating those in the church into
                      two groups—those who follow God and those who follow the
                      world. In some places grain is still shaken in a sieve so that
                      broken kernels, husks, and foreign particles fall through the
                      mesh, while the chaff is blown away.
                        How does the servant of the Lord describe the shaking?
                         "A storm is arising that will wrench and test the spiritual
                      foundation of every one to the utmost. Therefore avoid the sand
                      bed; hunt for the rock. Dig deep; lay your foundation sure.
                      Build, oh, build for eternity! Build with tears, with heartfelt
                      prayers."—Testimonies, vol. 5, pp. 129, 130.
                        Why does God allow Satan to sift and shake the church?
                         "God is sifting His people. He will have a clean and holy
                      church. We cannot read the heart of man. But the Lord has
                      provided means to keep the church pure."—Testimonies, vol. 1,
                      p. 99.
                        As in the case of Peter, so with us. Christ has provided us with
                      all the means to remain firm and loyal in the hour when our
                      spiritual foundations will be wrenched and tested to the utmost.

            Part 2      Why should the Christian watch and pray?
        CAUSES OF
       FAILURE-1        "Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit
                      indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak" (Matt. 26:41).

                         Watchfulness and prayer are the provisions of heaven to
                      enable us to meet any crisis in life.
                         The first cause of failure in the shaking.
                         Ellen White was shown in vision a great company mightily
                      shaken, surrounded by angels. The people were clothed with an
                      effective armor—the armor of God. But then she says: "The
                      numbers of this company had lessened. Some had been shaken
                      out and left by the way. The careless and indifferent, who did not
                      join with those who prized victory and salvation enough to
                      perseveringly plead and agonize for it, did not obtain it, and they
                      were left behind in darkness, and their places were immediately
                      filled by others taking hold of the truth and coming into the
                      ranks."—Early Writings, p. 271.
                          So, the first cause of failure is carelessness and indifference,
                      lack of pleading and agonizing for victory.
                         What will be the second cause of failure in the shaking out of
                      many?
                          Persecution because of the enforcement of the Sunday law.
                          "Let opposition arise, let bigotry and intolerance again bear
                      sway, let persecution be kindled, and the halfhearted and
                      hypocritical will waver and yield the faith; but the true Christian
                      will stand firm as a rock, his faith stronger, his hope brighter,
                      than in days of prosperity."—The Great Controversy, p. 602.
                          "As the storm approaches, a large class who have professed
                       faith in the third angel's message, but have not been sanctified
                       through obedience to the truth, abandon their position and join
                       the ranks of the opposition."—The Great Controversy, p. 608.
                          The test will be an individual one. "The members of the
                       church will individually be tested and proved. They will be
                       placed in circumstances where they will be forced to bear wit-

                     them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his
                     house upon the sand: and the rain descended, and the floods

                      it is imperfectly understood. When the shaking comes, by the
                      introduction of false theories, these surface readers, anchored
                      nowhere, are like shifting sand."—Testimonies to Ministers, p.

                      Satan's superstitions will assume new forms. Errors will be
                      presented in a pleasing and flattering manner. False theories,
                      clothed with garments of light, will be presented to God's
                      people. Thus Satan will try to deceive, if possible, the very elect.
                      Most seducing influences will be exerted; minds will be

                        "I asked the meaning of the shaking I had seen and was
                     shown that it would be caused by the straight testimony called
                     forth by the counsel of the True Witness to the Laodiceans. This
                     will have its effect upon the heart of the receiver, and will lead
                     him to exalt the standard and pour forth the straight truth. Some
                     will not bear this straight testimony. They will rise up against it,
                     and this is what will cause a shaking among God's people."—

                        Christ's counsel fits this need: (1) Buy gold tried in the fire—
                     faith and love—the fruits of the Holy Spirit. (2) Buy white
                     raiment—the righteousness of Christ: forgiveness (or justifica-

                     of Christ). (3) Buy eyesalve—the Holy Spirit, which gives wis-

                                                                      July 18
          Part 4      What admonition did Jesus give in His prophetic sermon?
     THE TIMING
                      "When these things begin to come to pass, then look up,
                    and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh"
                    (Luke 21:28).

                       Many people have the idea that the shaking is still in the
                    future. But this is not so. The mighty shaking of the people of
                    God, the division of the church into two different classes, has
                    already begun.
                       What indication do we have in the inspired writings regarding
                    the time of the shaking?
                       "The mighty shaking has commenced and will go on, and all
                    will be shaken out who are not willing to take a bold and unyield-
                    ing stand for the truth and to sacrifice for God and His cause."—
                    Early Writings, p. 50.
                       "I saw that we are now in the shaking time. Satan is working
                    with all his power to wrest souls from the hand of Christ and
                    cause them to trample underfoot the Son of God. An angel
                    slowly and emphatically repeated these words: 'Of how much
                    sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who
                    hath trodden underfoot the Son of God, and hath counted the
                    blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy
                    thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?' Charac-
                    ter is being developed. Angels of God are weighing moral worth.
                     God is testing and proving His people. These words were pre-
                    sented to me by the angel: 'Take heed, brethren, lest there be in
                    any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living
                     God. But exhort one another daily, while it is called today; lest
                     any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. For we
                     are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our
                    confidence steadfast unto the end.' "-Testimonies, vol. 1, p.
                    429.
                       "God is now sifting His people, testing their purposes and
                     their motives. Many will be but as chaff—no wheat, no value in
                    them"—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 51.

THINK IT THROUGH      Why is it necessary for God rather than man to separate the
                    chaff from the wheat? In what matters only can the church
                    exercise discipline?

                                                                              July 19
             Part 5      How did Paul express the truth that nothing could separate
       THE CHURCH      him from the love of Christ?
         WILL NOT
              FALL        "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribu-
                       lation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or
                       peril, or sword? ... Nay, in all these things we are more than
                       conquerors through him that loved us. For I am persuaded,
                       that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor
                       powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor
                       depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us
                       from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord" (Rom.
                       8:35-39).

                          Paul seems to suggest that tribulation, distress, persecution,
                       or any other difficult experiences that the Christian is called
                       upon to pass through, are not stumbling blocks to success but
                       the very circumstances in which we can be victorious. They are
                       the means whereby our faith is tested.
                          Nothing and no one will be able to shake us out of our rela-
                       tionship with Christ and His love if we just keep on looking to
                      and trusting in the Author and Finisher of our redemption.
                          Under adverse circumstances will the church of God fall?
                          "Satan will work his miracles to deceive; he will set up his
                      power as supreme. The church may appear as about to fall, but
                      it does not fall. It remains, while the sinners in Zion will be sifted
                      out—the chaff separated from the precious wheat. This is a
                      terrible ordeal, but nevertheless it must take place. None but
                      those who have been overcoming by the blood of the Lamb and
                      the word of their testimony will be found with the loyal and true,
                      without spot or stain of sin, without guile in their mouths. We
                      must be divested of our self-righteousness and arrayed in the
                      righteousness of Christ."—Selected Messages, bk. 2, p. 380.
                          God will not spew the church out of His mouth, but only the
                      lukewarm, the indifferent, the halfhearted. Only those who do
                      not take refuge in the power of God, who do not surrender
                      completely to Him and allow Him to act in their lives, only those
                      who do not divest themselves of their own righteousness and
                      array themselves in the righteousness of Christ will have to be
                      shaken out. But the church, cleansed and purified, will continue
                      her onward march to the city of God.

The Shaking         LESSON 3                                            ❑ Friday
                                                                         July 20
          Part 6       What is the wise admonition of the apostle Paul?
   HOW TO AVOID
        FALLING        "Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall"
                     (1 Cor. 10:12).

                        The Christian life is a struggle. It is an onward and an upward
                     march. The road is narrow, and the gate is small (Matt. 7:14,
                     NIV). But every child of God has to face a special crisis—the time
                     of sifting. He must withstand the sifting in the sieve of trouble
                     and temptation. He has to face the winds of conflict and tribula-
                     tion and stand upright.
                        What vision did the servant of the Lord have regarding the
                     shaking?
                        "I saw some, with strong faith and agonizing cries, pleading
                     with God. Their countenances were pale and marked with deep
                     anxiety, expressive of their internal struggle. Firmness and
                     great earnestness was expressed in their countenances; large
                     drops of perspiration fell from their foreheads. Now and then
                     their faces would light up with the marks of God's approbation,
                     and again the same solemn, earnest, anxious look would settle
                     upon them."—Early Writings, p. 269.
                        Although vexed by deep anxiety and passing through a terri-
                     ble internal struggle, every one of us may pass triumphantly
                     through the test if we maintain unbroken our vital contact with
                     heaven and keep our dependence on Christ, who is our victory
                     and the only Source of our strength.
                        What were the evil angels trying to do with these afflicted
                     children of God?
                        "Evil angels crowded around, pressing darkness upon them
                     to shut out Jesus from their view, that their eyes might be drawn
                     to the darkness that surrounded them, and thus they be led to
                      distrust God and murmur against Him. Their only safety was in
                      keeping their eyes directed upward."—Early Writings, p. 269.
                        "We are in the shaking time, the time when everything that
                      can be shaken will be shaken. The Lord will not excuse those
                      who know the truth if they do not in word and deed obey His
                      commands. If we make no effort to win souls to Christ we shall
                      be held responsible for the work we might have done, but did
                      not do because of our spiritual indolence. Those who belong to
                      the Lord's kingdom must work earnestly for the saving of souls. •
                      They must do their part to bind up the law and seal it among the

                     1, p. 469.
                        What is the difference between a revival and a reformation?
                        "A revival and a reformation must take place under the minis-
                     tration of the Holy Spirit. Revival and reformation are two dif-
                     ferent things. Revival signifies a renewal of spiritual life, a quick-
                     ening of the powers of mind and heart, a resurrection from the
                     spiritual death. Reformation signifies a reorganization, a
                     change in ideas and theories, habits and practices."—Christian
                     Service, p. 42.
                        What assurances do we have that the reformation will be
                     effected?
                        "I have been deeply impressed by scenes that have recently
                     passed before me in the night season. There seemed to be a
                     great movement—a work of revival—going forward in many
                     places. Our people were moving into line, responding to God's
                     call."—Testimonies to Ministers, p. 515.

Revival and Reformation          LESSON 4                              ❑ Monday
                                                                             July 23
          Part 2   What should we remember about the nature and plans of
    DISCOVERING Satan?
        SATANIC
   COUNTERFEITS    "Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father
                 ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode
                 not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he
                 speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the
                 father of it" (John 8:44).

                       It has always been the consistent plan of Satan to counterfeit
                    the genuine spiritual reformation that the Lord desires to ac-
                    complish in His people. This has been his method to cause
                    confusion, chaos, and disruption in God's plan.
                       "In every revival he [Satan] is ready to bring in those who are
                    unsanctified in heart and unbalanced in mind. . . .
                           . . In all the history of the church no reformation has been
                    carried forward without encountering serious obstacles. Thus it
                    was in Paul's day. Wherever the apostle raised up a church,
                    there were some who professed to receive the faith, but who
                    brought in heresies, that, if received, would eventually crowd
                    out the love of the truth."—The Great Controversy, p. 396.
                       Satan uses three principal methods to disrupt the reformation
                    that is to change the church: (1) he sows a spirit of discord and
                    strife; (2) he inspires destructive criticism of the leadership; (3)
                    he causes fanaticism.
                        "The time has come for a thorough reformation to take place.
                    When this reformation begins, the spirit of prayer will actuate
                     every believer and will banish from the church the spirit of
                     discord and strife."—Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 251. In other words,
                     discord and strife cannot go along with a reformation.
                        In describing a false reform movement, Ellen White wrote:
                     "He [the so-called reformer] thought God had passed all the
                     leading workers and given him the message."
                        Another disrupter of reform is fanaticism. "Fanaticism will
                     appear in the very midst of us. Deceptions will come, and of
                     such a character that if it were possible they would mislead the
                     very elect."—Selected Messages, bk. 2, p. 16. Luther, the Wes-
                     leys, and William Miller, as well as others, suffered perplexities
                     because of the work of unsanctified and unbalanced fanatics.

           Part 3    What is the standard by which every teaching is to be
        NEW LIGHT judged?

                       "To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not accord-
                     ing, to this word, it is because there is no light in them" (Isa.
                     8:20).

                         With the excuse of trying to cause a revival and reformation in
                      the church, a number of individuals have claimed to bring "new
                      light." This is one way Satan seeks to trap careless souls. The
                      Bible statement (Isa. 8:20) does not invalidate any correct en-
                      largement on fundamental truths or any clearer understanding
                      of prophecy. But "when the power of God testifies as to what is
                      truth, that truth is to stand forever as the truth. No after supposi-
                      tions contrary to the light God has given are to be entertained."
                     —Selected Messages, bk. 1, p. 161.
                         What are the three great marks of any authentic new light?
                         1.It will be 100 percent in accord with the Word of God, and it
                      will not depend on any whimsical and unbalanced interpreta-
                      tion of the Scriptures.
                         "Men and women will arise professing to have some new light
                      or some new revelation whose tendency is to unsettle faith in
                      the old landmarks. Their doctrines will not bear the test of God's
                      word, yet souls will be deceived."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 295.
                         2. It will not contradict any of the basic truths already estab-
                     lished as immovable pillars in the doctrinal structure of the
                      church.
                         "He [Godj does not give one man new light contrary to the
                     established faith of the body. In every reform men have arisen
                     making this claim."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 291.
                         3.These who proclaim the new light will not be infatuated with
                     the idea that they are superior to their brethren. They will not be
                     proud that God has chosen them, bypassing His people. This in
                     general, is the exalted view leaders of so-called "reform move-
                     ments" mistakenly hold of themselves.
                         "God has not passed His people by and chosen one solitary
                     man here and another there as the only ones worthy to be
                     entrusted with His truth."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 291.
                         "Let none be self-confident, as though God had given them
                     special light above their brethren. Christ is represented as dwell-

                                                                        July 25

          Part 4     What is one of the most important signs set by Christ
       SIGNS OF     whereby we can. judge the correctness of any movement?
           TRUE
   REFORMATION        "Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's
                    clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. Ye shall know
                    them by their fruits" (Matt. 7:15, 16).

                        False teachers will sometimes appear to be sheep. But they
                    cannot deny their inner natures. Sooner or later they will reveal
                    their selfish interests and purposes. They will feed on the flock
                    like the wolf that snatches a lamb to satisfy his hunger.
                        What are the marks of a true reformation?
                        "In visions of the night, representations passed before me of a
                    great reformatory movement among God's people. Many were
                    praising God. The sick were healed, and other miracles were
                    wrought. A spirit of intercession was seen, even as was man-
                    ifested before the great Day of Pentecost. Hundreds and
                    thousands were seen visiting families and opening before them
                    the word of God. Hearts were convicted by the power of the Holy
                     Spirit, and a spirit of genuine conversion was manifest. On every
                     side doors were thrown open to the proclamation of the truth.
                     The world seemed to be lightened with the heavenly influence.
                     Great blessings were received by the true and humble people of
                     God. I heard voices of thanksgiving and praise, and there
                     seemed to be a reformation such as we witnessed in 1844."—
                    Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 126.
                        We can glean from this quotation these different elements
                     that distinguish a real reformatory movement:
                         1. A spirit of intercession and praise, which implies a spirit of
                     prayer. Prayer is the focal point of reformation.
                         2.A spirit of genuine conversion—a change of life. Nobody can
                     stop the leavening power of a life really transformed by the Holy
                     Spirit.
                         3. A spirit of active witnessing. The servant of the Lord saw
                     hundreds and thousands of people visiting families and open-
                     ing before them the Word of God.
                         4. An additional mark is a spirit of generosity.
                         "Some refused to be converted. They were not willing to walk
                      in God's way, and when, in order that the work of God might be
                      advanced, calls were made for freewill offerings, some clung
                      selfishly to their earthly possessions. These covetous ones be-
                      came separated from the company of believers."—Testimonies,
                      vol. 9, p. 126.

  SOME ELEMENTS     tion in the life?
 OF REFORMATION
                      "Put off your old nature which belongs to your former man-
                    ner of life and is corrupt through deceitful lusts, and be re-
                    newed in the spirit of your minds, and put on the new nature,
                    created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and
                    holiness" (Eph. 4:22-24 RSV).

                       Paul is very specific when he points out that a reformation
                    involves a complete change of nature. We no longer tell lies,
                    lose our temper, steal, or use bad language. (See vv. 25-32.) We
                    become kind and forgiving as God has been kind to us and has
                    forgiven our sins.
                       "The reformation will be outward as well as inward.."—
                    Counsels on Diet and Foods, p. 35.
                       What are some of the external aspects of a reformation?
                      1.Habits of personal devotion. There can be no spiritual life
                    and real conversion without time given every day to prayer and
                    study of the Bible.
                      2. Our interrelations, in the church, in the community, in our
                    institutions and offices, and everywhere. Love will replace
                    hatred and anger. (See Gal. 5:19-23.)
                      3. The behavior in the home will be different. An atmosphere
                    of joy and peace, of cheerfulness and kindness, will prevail
                    within the sacred precincts of the home, making it a little heaven
                    on earth. The relations of husbands and wives, parents and
                    children will be totally different.
                      4. Healthful living. The love of God in our hearts will cause us
                    to heed the principles of health presented to us in the spirit of
                    prophecy. Meat will be eliminated from our diets, sugar will be
                    cut to a very minimum, and cholesterol-producing foods will be
                    greatly restricted or eliminated. Whole cereals, fruits, vegeta-
                    bles, and nuts will be the basic diet. We will use the "true
                    remedies" to restore and maintain health—"pure air, sunlight,
                    abstemiousness, rest, exercise, proper diet, the use of water,
                    [and] trust in divine power."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 127.
                      5. Dress and fashion. "Obedience to fashion is pervading our
                    Seventh-day Adventist churches and is doing more than any
                    other power to separate our people from God."—Testimonies,
                    vol. 4, p. 647.
                      6. Sabbath observance will be more faithful.
                      7. Amusements and social activities, as well as the kind of
                    music and reading matter, will speak about our complete con-
                    version and reformation. We will not let the TV set become a
                    curse for our home and our character.

HOW TO ACCOMPLISH reformation?
      REVIVAL AND
     REFORMATION      "Don't let the world around you squeeze you into its own
                   mould, but let God re-make you so that your whole attitude of
                   mind is changed. Thus you will prove in practice that the will of
                   God's good, acceptable to him and perfect" (Rom. 12:2, Phil-
                   lips).

                         Reformation does not focus on changing symptoms. While it
                       affects both the external and the internal aspects of life, it
                       begins internally with the renewing of the mind.
                         When the soul looks for the source of spiritual life and sur-
                       renders to Christ, it is put under the influence of the Holy Spirit,
                       which in turn begins to work powerfully in producing the
                       change.
                         "Circumstances cannot work reforms. Christianity proposes
                       a reformation in the heart. What Christ works within, will be
                       worked out under the dictation of a converted intellect. The plan
                       of beginning outside and trying to work inward has always
                       failed, and always will fail. God's plan with you is to begin at the
                       very seat of all difficulties, the heart, and then from out of the
                       heart will issue the principles of righteousness."—Counsels on

                       our minds in order to effect spiritual renewal? 2 Cor. 3:18.

                         By exposing our minds and our hearts to the beautiful, noble,
                       and perfect character of Jesus, we allow that character to be
                       reproduced in us.
                         Photographically speaking, if we want to reproduce a lovely
                       face or a wonderful scene of nature with its colors and beauty,
                       we open the camera and let the reflection of the object impress
                       the sensitive film. Then we obtain a marvelous picture that
                       reproduces the original. If we want the character of Christ to be
                       reproduced in our life, our heart has to be exposed to Christ.

              Part 1     What is one of the most ancient cries of the human heart?
            NEED OF
     RIGHTEOUSNESS       "How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be
                       clean that is born of a woman?" (Job. 25:4).

                         Awareness of sinfulness and a sense of guilt are not superfi-
                       cial feelings. They are deeply rooted convictions in the human
                       heart. It is the Holy Spirit who convicts human beings—
                       Christian and non-Christian alike—of their sinful condition.
                       (See John 16:8.) And He continues to do so in every case unless
                       the individual has hardened himself beyond the point of
                       spiritual perception and repentance.

                         How does the apostle Paul establish the universal sinful-
                       ness of man? Rom. 3:10, 23.

                          Man's greatest problem is sin and the sense of guilt that
                       comes with it. Nothing burdens the heart so heavily and trou-
                       bles the mind so much as sin and guilt.
                          Most of the physical and mental illnesses of humanity have
                       their root right here, and people are willing to pay almost any
                       price to recover peace of mind. For this reason great multitudes
                       go to confession to tell of their sins and mistakes, and even a
                       greater number go to the psychiatrist to unload their hearts
                       from this terrible burden. In some Christian and non-Christian
                       circles hundreds of thousands participate in pilgrimages, phys-
                       ical sacrifices, punishments, and penitences, hoping to solve
                       the great problem.
                          But it is all in vain for salvation. The only solution is the one
                       presented so clearly in the Bible.

                         What is the only remedy for sin and sinfulness? Matt.
                       11:28-30; Heb. 12:1, 2.

                         What a pity that so many people look in the wrong direction to
                       solve their basic spiritual problems!
                         It is also a shame that so many Christians are so confused and
                       mistaken in this regard, as we shall see in part 2.

THINK IT THROUGH         How would you explain righteousness by faith clearly and
                       concisely?

                         "It is impossible for us, of ourselves, to escape from the pit of

           Part 2   What two righteousnesses does Paul contrast?
   MAN'S METHOD
         VERSUS     "I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowl-
   GOD'S METHOD edge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the
                  loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win
                  Christ, and be found in him, not having my own righteousness,
                  which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ,
                  the righteousness which is of God by faith" (Phil. 3:8, 9).

                       "My own righteousness" is one form of righteousness. The
                    "righteousness ... of God" through faith in Christ is another. In
                    other words, righteousness by works versus righteousness by
                    faith. To try to obtain salvation by any kind of human effort or by
                    any trust in human works or merit is absolutely futile. Salvation
                    is obtained by grace, the grace of God, and is a result of appro-
                    priating the merits of Christ by faith in Him, which includes
                    surrender to Him.
                       Are we as Seventh-day Adventists in danger of falling into the
                    pattern of the ancient Jews, who sought salvation by their "own
                    righteousness, which is of the law"? Certainly we are. Actually,
                    any moment we lose sight of the vital importance of the work of
                    Christ and rely on our own effort or merits to earn heaven—any
                    moment we trust in our good works—we are falling into the
                    same grave mistake as the Israelites of old. Many Christians
                    make this great mistake today.
                       The only source of righteousness is God, and our only righ-
                    teousness is in Christ. Whenever we confess our sins, He for-
                    gives us and cleanses us from our sins, presenting us perfect
                    before the throne of God. In addition, He writes His law on the
                    fleshy tables of our hearts, endows us with His Spirit, makes us
                    new creatures. The first is His imputed righteousness. The sec-
                    ond, His imparted righteousness. But it is always His righteous-
                    ness.
                       From the beginning man has tried to develop his own righ-
                     teousness, substituting his human method instead for the di-
                     vine plan. Cain despised God's way—a lamb sacrifice which
                     would show his faith in the Redeemer to come—and presented
                     an offering not in keeping with God's plan. Adam made an
                     apron of fig leaves to cover the shame of his nakedness. But the
                     Lord covered Adam and Eve with skins of animals slain as a
                     symbol of the death of Christ, the Substitute for sinners.

        IMPUTED man can be justified? Rom. 3:24, 25, 28.
  RIGHTEOUSNESS
                     When we accept Jesus as our personal Saviour and put our
                  faith in Him, we receive instant reconciliation with God. We are
                  forgiven, counted perfect; and before God it is as if we had
                  never sinned.

                      Review also these wonderful passages: Eph. 2:8, 9; Rom.
                    3:20; 1 John 1:7-9; Rom. 5:1.

                       All these scriptures present in a very clear way the same basic
                    and glorious truth: we are justified, pardoned, cleansed, and
                    reconciled to God—not by the merit of any work, but by faith in
                    Christ.
                       This is the essence of Christianity: trust in God, reliance on
                    Him, and utter dependence on Christ and His righteousness, a
                    righteousness which becomes ours by faith.

                      What is faith? How does real faith manifest itself? James
                    2:14, 17, 18, 20.

                      Faith is not a mere mental attitude. It reveals itself in works.
                   Faith not only causes a man to believe in Jesus with his mind,
                   but it also involves his emotional faculties—his heart, his love,
                   all of which he gives to God.
                      Ellen White describes "perfect faith" as the "surrender of self
                   to God."—Gospel Workers, p. 260. Or again: ''Saving faith is a
                   transaction, by which those who receive Christ join themselves
                   in covenant relation with God."—Gospel Workers, p. 261.
                      Thus, righteousness by faith is more than an acquittal, a
                   theory, or a doctrine. It is a transaction that results in a covenant
                   relationship with God and with Jesus. This newfound interac-
                   tion with God changes the whole life, causing the person to
                   surrender completely to Christ, and Christ gives him forgive-
                   ness, victory, and cleansing.
                      How important is it for us to understand and accept justifica-
                   tion by faith?
                      "The enemy of man and God is not willing that this truth
                   [justification by faith] should be clearly presented; for he knows
                   that if the people receive it fully, his power will be broken. If he
                   can control minds so that doubt and unbelief and darkness shall
                   compose the experience of those who claim to be the children
                   of God, he can overcome them with temptation."—Ellen G.

 RIGHTEOUSNESS       "This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our
                   faith" (1 John 5:4).

                       After being justified by faith in Jesus, we may have the power
                   of God, and the presence of the Holy Spirit in our hearts to have
                   the personal victory over sin.
                       What are the two facets of the righteousness of Christ, and
                   what is accomplished by each?
                       "The righteousness by which we are justified is imputed; the
                   righteousness by which we are sanctified is imparted. The first
                   is our title to heaven, the second is our fitness for heaven."—
                   Messages to Young People, p. 35.
                       When we have repented from our sins and confessed them to
                   God, asking for forgiveness in the name of Jesus and accepting
                   His sacrifice by faith, we are completely pardoned and consid-
                   ered righteous. We are justified. It is an instantaneous, miracu-
                   lous operation. In the sight of God we are perfect, free from guilt,
                   and ready for heaven. Should we die at that precise moment, we
                   would be saved. "The righteousness by which we are justified"
                   is our title to heaven.
                       But, should we continue to live, that righteousness by which
                   we are justified is accompanied and immediately followed by
                   the righteousness that sanctifies us. Since we shall have our
                   sinful natures until the day of our translation, we shall con-
                    stantly need to be justified while sanctification also is going on
                    in our lives. Nevertheless, faith that is real and authentic pro-
                   duces works, a change of life. And that changed life is our
                    fitness for heaven. "Faith and works go together, believing and
                    doing are blended."—Selected Messages, bk. 1, p. 373.
                       While justification is an instantaneous operation, sanctifica-
                    tion is the work of a lifetime. In justification God imputes or
                   credits to us the righteousness of Christ. In sanctification He

                     As we shall see under part 5, He has made ample provision for

                OF THE    "Go, and sin no more" (John 8:11).
        DIVINE NATURE
                          After Christ forgave the woman taken in adultery, He told her:
                        "Go, and sin no more." This is the program God has for His
                        children.

                         What provision has God given us to achieve this goal?
                       2 Peter 1:4.

                          God wants to make us partakers of the divine nature. He
                       wants to restore His image in us. He is willing to impart to us His
                       perfect character. This along with His imputed righteousness is
                       the white garment with which He has promised to clothe us.
                          "No repentance is genuine that does not work reformation.
                       The righteousness of Christ is not a cloak to cover unconfessed
                       and unforsaken sin; it is a principle of life that transforms the
                       character and controls the conduct. Holiness is wholeness for
                       God; it is the entire surrender of heart and life to the indwelling
                       of the principles of heaven."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 555, 556.

                         What high standard has Jesus set for the Christian? Matt.
                       5:48.

                         The idea of perfection in the original is to "Be mature, grown
                       up." The Christian life is a spiritual growth.

                         With what words of assurance does the apostle Jude refer
                       to-the willingness and ability of God to keep us holy and
                       faultless? Jude 24.

                         "When we are clothed with the righteousness of Christ, we
                      shall have no relish for sin; for Christ will be working with us. We
                      may make mistakes, but we will hate the sin that caused the
                      suffering of the Son of God."—Messages to Young people, p.
                      338.
                         "When Christ is in the heart it will be so softened and subdued
                      by love for God and man that fretting, faultfinding, and conten-
                      tion will not exist there. The religion of Christ in the heart will

        CHRIST'S
  RIGHTEOUSNESS     The dying of self, the recognition of our own impotency and
                 our need of Christ, is the prerequisite for receiving the rich
                 garment of Christ's righteousness.
                    This recognition of need leads to a surrender to Jesus—
                 renewed daily, hourly.
                    "When the soul surrenders itself to Christ, a new power takes
                 possession of the new heart. A change is wrought which man
                 can never accomplish for himself.... The soul that is yielded to
                 Christ becomes His own fortress, . . . impregnable to the as-
                 saults of Satan. But unless we do yield ourselves to the control
                 of Christ, we shall be dominated by the wicked one."—The
                 Desire of Ages, p. 324.
                    Included in the surrender to Christ is the confession and
                 putting away of sins, claiming His promises by faith.
                    "Wicked men and devils cannot hinder the work of God ... if
                 they [God's people] will, with subdued, contrite hearts, confess
                 and put away their sins, and in faith claim his promises. Every
                 temptation, every opposing influence, whether open or secret,
                 may be successfully resisted, 'not by might, nor by power, but by
                 my Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.' "—Ellen G. White, Review
                 and Herald, March 22, 1887.
                    What is another aspect of living a victorious life? A vital and
                 permanent connection with God.
                    "Unless we become vitally connected with God, we can never
                  resist the unhallowed effects of self-love, self-indulgence, and
                 temptation to sin. We may leave off many bad habits, for the time
                  we may part company with Satan; but without a vital connection
                  with God, through the surrender of ourselves to Him moment by
                 moment, we shall be overcome. Without a personal acquain-
                  tance with Christ, and a continual communion, we are at the
                  mercy of the enemy."—The Desire of Ages, p. 324.
                     Why have many been defeated in their Christian warfare?
                     "They had struggled to refrain from sin, but had trusted in
                  their own strength. We should go to Jesus just as we are,
                  confess our sins, and cast our helpless souls upon our compas-
                  sionate Redeemer. This subdues the pride of the heart, and is a

                        said, 'It is done.' "—Early Writings, p. 279.
                          Just as in the time of Ezekiel (chapter 9:2-6) a man with a

                          What similar marking is carried on by a different power?
                        Rev. 13:16, 17.

                           "While one class, by accepting the sign of submission to

The Sealing        LESSON 6                                              ❑    Monday
                                                                             August 6
          Part 2      What served as a seal of righteousness for Abraham?
       WHAT THE
         SEAL IS      "He [Abraham] received circumcision as a sign or seal of
                    the righteousness which he had by faith" (Rom. 4:11, RSV).

                      In Old Testament times circumcision was an outward sign of
                    the covenant relationship which God had with Abraham and his
                    descendants. When the children of Israel broke that relation-
                    ship, then circumcision ceased to be a meaningful rite and
                    became merely a surgical operation (Rom. 2:28, 29). For the
                    Christian, circumcision has no religious value (Gal. 5:6). It is his
                    faith in Jesus, working through love, that is vital.

                       What are the visible signs of the Christian? John 13:35;
                     14:15; 15:10, 12.

                       When the Christian keeps the commandments of God, he
                     accepts the sovereignty of God. When he keeps the fourth
                     commandment, he accepts God as Creator of heaven and earth.
                       In these days of skepticism regarding the Bible, and general
                     acceptance of the theory of evolution, it is a distinctive mark for
                     a group of Christians to believe in the Genesis story of Creation
                     and to keep the seventh-day Sabbath as its memorial.

                       Of what is the Sabbath a sign besides that of Creation? Eze.
                     20:11, 12.

                        About the seal as an external mark, Ellen White wrote:
                        "The fourth commandment is the only one of all the ten in
                     which are found both the name and the title of the Lawgiver. It is
                     the only one that shows by whose authority the law is given.
                     Thus it contains the seal of God, affixed to His law as evidence of
                     its authenticity and binding force."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
                     p. 307.
                        "The sign, or seal, of God is revealed in the observance of the
                     seventh-day Sabbath, the Lord's memorial of creation. 'The
                     Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak thou also unto the chil-
                     d ren of Israel, saying, Verily My Sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a
                     sign between Me and you throughout your generations; that ye
                     may know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify you.' Exodus
                     31:12, 13. Here the Sabbath is clearly designated as a sign
                      between God and His people."—Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 117.
                        A seal is a mark of ownership, a symbol of allegiance, a sign of
                      quality. Can you see how the keeping of the Sabbath fits in with
                      these meanings?

 THINK IT THROUGH      How can my keeping the Sabbath be a sign of my allegiance

                        his Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee" (2 Cor. 1:21, 22, RSV).

                          By establishing us in the faith and giving us a work to do, God
                        has placed His seal of approval on us; and the fact that we have
                        the Holy Spirit operating in our lives is a guarantee that this is
                        the case.

                          What is God's last message to a dying world? Rev. 14:6-12.

                         The first angel carries an everlasting gospel to every habitable
                       part of the world. He calls upon everyone to worship the
                       Creator, since a time of judgment has come.
                         The second angel warns against heresy and false doctrine.
                         The third angel proclaims doom upon those who worship the
                       beast and its image instead of worshiping the true God.
                         Thus in the last days there will be two classes on the earth: 1.
                       those who honor God and keep His commandments; and 2.
                       those who give their allegiance to another power and receive its
                       special mark.
                         The keeping of the Sabbath in the end of time will take on
                       special significance as indicating a loyalty to God, as opposed
                       to rendering allegiance to an earthly power.

                          When does a special sealing take place? Rev. 7:2, 3.

                          The context of these verses indicates that the people of God
                       are sealed just before the time of trouble. Four angels hold back
                       the winds of strife till the sealing work is done, because those
                       who are sealed will not be affected by the destruction that takes
                       place when the winds are loosed. Immediately after this the
                       saints are seen in heaven. vv. 9-17.
                          "The sealing time is very short, and will soon be over. Now is
                       the time, while the four angels are holding the four winds, to
                       make our calling and election sure."—Early Writings, p. 58.
                          "When this time of trouble comes, every case is decided;
                       there is no longer probation, no longer mercy for the impeni-
                       tent. The seal of the living God is upon His people."—Testimo-

The Sealing      LESSON 6                                            ❑ Wednesday
                                                                        August 8
            Part 4     What is the agency God uses to seal us?
   SANCTIFICATION
 AND PREPARATION       "Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed
                     unto the day of redemption" (Eph. 4:30).

                       It is God Himself, as the Holy Spirit, who does the work of
                     sealing human hearts for eternity.
                       The context of this verse indicates that the Christian is to shun
                     sin. Sin grieves the Holy Spirit. He cannot condone it; so He
                     cannot place His seal on one who indulges in it. See verse 32 for
                     the marks of a true Christian.
                       "Just as soon as the people of God are sealed in their
                     foreheads—it is not any seal or mark that can be seen, but a
                     settling into the truth, both intellectually and spiritually, so they
                     cannot be moved—just as soon as God's people are sealed and
                     prepared for the shaking, it will come. Indeed, it has begun
                     already."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commen-
                     tary, vol. 4, p. 1161.

                       When God holds His own, how safe are they? John 10:27-29.

                       Jesus makes it very clear that if we hear His voice and follow
                     Him we can be safe from any adversary.
                       The sealing is a spiritual preparation for the latter rain and the
                     loud cry. By it believers will be enabled to stand unmoved
                     during the time of trouble.

                       When will the opportunity to receive the seal of God be gone
                     forever? Rev. 15:5-8.

                        "Jesus is in His holy temple and will now accept our sac-
                     rifices, our prayers, and our confessions of faults and sins and
                     will pardon all the transgressions of Israel, that they may be
                     blotted out before He leaves the sanctuary. When Jesus leaves
                     the sanctuary, then they who are holy and righteous will be holy
                     and righteous still; for all their sins will be blotted out, and they
                     will be sealed with the seal of the living God. But those that are
                     unjust and filthy will be unjust and filthy still."—Early Writings,
                     p. 48.

THINK IT THROUGH       In view of the importance of the sealing work, how should
                     the Christian react?
                       "This [the sealing in Rev. 7:1-3] points out the work we now
                     have to do, which is to cry to God for the angels to hold the four
                     winds until missionaries shall be sent to all parts of the world,
                     and shall have proclaimed the warning against disobeying the
                     law of Jehovah."—Ellen G. White, Review and Herald, Dec. 11,

          Part 5    Who are the ones who are sealed?
     CONDITIONS
        FOR THE    "And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and
        SEALING there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of
                 all the tribes of the children of Israel" (Rev. 7:4).

                       Many have been concerned about the number that are
                    sealed—is it a literal or a symbolic number? On the whole it
                    seems more reasonable to suppose that the 144,000 are not
                    literal Jews but figurative Israelites, that is, spiritual Israel who
                    compose the Christian church.
                       Here are some words of wisdom:
                       "It is not His [God's] will that they shall get into controversy
                    over questions which will not help them spiritually, such as,
                    Who is to compose the hundred and forty-four thousand? This
                    those who are the elect of God will in a short time know without
                    question."—Selected Messages, bk. 1, p. 174.
                       "Let no man attempt to number Israel today, but let everyone
                    have a heart of flesh, a heart of tender sympathy, a heart that,
                    like the heart of Christ, reaches out for the salvation of a lost
                    world."—Prophets and Kings, p. 189.
                       "Let us strive [by looking to Jesus] with all the power that God

                    970.

                      What are the spiritual traits of the saved? Rev. 15:2-4.

                      The song of Moses is a song of deliverance. (See Ex. 15:1-21.)
                    The song of the Lamb is a song of praise and adoration to the
                    One who has so marvelously delivered His people. (See Rev.
                    15:3, 4.) The saints have gained the victory over every earthly
                    power or movement that has presumed to take the place of God.
                    They have not been deceived, but have remained true to God
                    through every trial and affliction. Thus they are now safe on the
                    sea of glass.
                      "Not all who profess to keep the Sabbath will be sealed. There
                    are many even among those who teach the truth to others who
                    will not receive the seal of God in their foreheads."—Testimonies,

The Sealing         LESSON 6                                               ❑ Friday
                                                                           August 10
           Part 6    Aside from the Holy Spirit, who else is a vital party in the
      FULFILLING     process of the sealing?
 THE CONDITIONS
                       "In whom [Christ] also after that ye believed, ye were sealed
                     with that holy Spirit of promise" (Eph. 1:13).

                       The context of this verse tells us that we hear the word of God,
                     and then we believe it. When we believe it, we are "marked with
                     a seal" (NIV). This seal is the gift of the Holy Spirit. It becomes a
                     guarantee of redemption, which will find its final fulfillment at
                     the second coming of Christ. (See Rom. 8:23.)

                       How only can we be saved? Eph. 2:5-10.

                        When we were dead in trespasses and sins, God took the
                     initiative and saved us because of His inexpressible love. We
                     accept this love and provision and trust in Him, and God com-
                     pletes His work in us. It is wholly God's work (2 Cor. 5:18) and a
                     free gift from Him (Rom. 6:23). Thus there is no room for boast-
                     ing on our part, because we have only to accept what God has
                     done and can and will do for us.
                        This grace does not mean that we can keep on sinning and be
                     saved (Rom. 6:1-4). On the contrary, when a person is saved, his
                      connection with Christ means that he lives a new life (2 Cor.
                     5:17) because his desires have changed. Jesus came to save us
                     from our sins, and He makes us a people "zealous for good
                     deeds" (Titus 2:13, 14, RSV).

                        What promises do we have that as we are vitally united with
                      Christ every day and at every moment, surrendering to Him
                      and depending on Him by faith, the victory is guaranteed?
                      1 Cor. 15:57; Jude 24; Rom. 8:2.

                        "Those that overcome the world, the flesh, and the devil, will
                      be the favored ones who shall receive the seal of the living God.
                      Those whose hands are not clean, whose hearts are not pure,
                      will not have the seal of the living God. Those who are planning
                      sin and acting it will be passed by. Only those who, in their
                      attitude before God, are filling the position of those who are
                      repenting and confessing their sins in the great antitypical day
                      of atonement, will be recognized and marked as worthy of
                      God's protection."—Testimonies to Ministers, p. 445.

                   the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost"
                   (Matt. 28:19).
                     "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God,
                   and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all" (2 Cor.
                   13:14).

                       The word "trinity" is not found in the Bible; but scripture texts
                    that refer to God show very clearly that, although there is one
                    God (1 Tim. 2:5), the Godhead embraces three persons—the
                    Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
                       In Hebrew, the word for God is Elohim (gods). In the account
                    of Creation, the Bible also uses the plural pronoun "us" in
                    referring to God. It is interesting to note that the plural noun
                    Elohim is often used with a singular verb. This suggests that
                    God is both a plurality and a unity.
                       Each member of the Trinity has in Himself the divine attri-
                    butes: He is eternal, omniscient, omnipotent, and holy. Each
                    one of the three is fully God and not a part. Each one is an
                    integral unit of the whole. The Father is God, the Son is God, and
                    the Spirit is God. All three are absolutely one in Their thinking
                    and planning, one in Their love and essence. All three have part
                    in our creation and redemption.

                      What is the most striking demonstration of the absolute
                    unity and also the distinction between the three persons of the
                    Godhead? Matt. 3:16, 17.

                       The subject of the Trinity is impossible for us to understand.
                    In fact, it will be impossible ever to grasp it with our reasoning
                    powers (1 Tim. 3:16), because our minds are finite and God is
                    infinite. Just as it is impossible to put all the water of the oceans
                    in one single glass, so it is impossible to put the infinite mind
                    and logic of God into our finite minds. "No human mind can
                    comprehend God. Let not finite man attempt to interpret Him.
                    Let none indulge in speculation regarding His nature. Here
                    silence is eloquence. The Omniscient One is above discussion."
                    —Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 279.
                       Nevertheless, we should be grateful that such a majestic God
                    has loved us so much that He decided to come to this obscure
                    and sinful world in order to live as we do, to toil, to suffer as a
                    human being, and finally to die that He might redeem us for
                    eternity.

The Holy Spirit     LESSON 7                                          ❑ Monday
                                                                       August 13
          Part 2      What text of Scripture reveals that the Holy Spirit is a per-
      A PERSON      son?

                      "Grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed
                    unto the day of redemption" (Eph. 4:30).

                       There is a tendency to think of the Holy Spirit in terms of an
                    "influence," or a "power," making Him to be something imper-
                    sonal. The Scriptures teach that the Spirit is a person. The
                    expression, "grieve not," cannot be applied to anything other
                    than a person.
                       Other passages point to the Holy Spirit as a person:
                       1. He speaks (1 Tim. 4:1).
                       2. He teaches (John 14:26).
                       3. He reproves (John 16:8).
                       4. He makes intercession (Rom. 8:26).
                       5. Man could lie to Him (Acts 5:3).
                       6. He loves (Rom. 15:30).
                       7. Man may have communion with Him (2 Cor. 13:14).
                       8. He may be insulted, tempted, sinned against (Heb. 10:29;
                    Acts 5:9; Matt. 12:31, 32).
                       Ellen White refers thus to the Holy Spirit:
                       "We need to realize that the Holy Spirit, who is as much a
                    person as God is a person, is walking through these grounds....
                    (From a talk to the students at the Avondale School.)
                       "The Holy Spirit is a person, for He beareth witness with our
                    spirits that we are the children of God. When this witness is
                    borne, it carries with it its own evidence. At such times we
                    believe and are sure that we are the children of God... .
                       "The Holy Spirit has a personality, else He could not bear
                     witness to our spirits and with our spirits that we are the chil-
                    dren of God. He must also be a divine person, else He could not
                     search out the secrets which lie hidden in the mind of God. 'For
                     what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man
                     which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but
                     the Spirit of God.'.
                       "The prince of the power of evil can only be held in check by
                     the power of God in the third person of the Godhead, the Holy
                     Spirit" 2—Evangelism, pp. 616, 617.

                    person?

The Holy Spirit       LESSON 7                                             ❑ Tuesday
                                                                            August 14
           Part 3      What did Christ tell His disciples before leaving them?
A REPRESENTATIVE
                       "It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the
                     Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him
                     unto you" (John 16:7).

                         "They [the disciples] are to contend with supernatural forces,
                      but they are assured of supernatural help. All the intelligences
                      of heaven are in this army. And more than angels are in the
                      ranks. The Holy Spirit, the representative of the Captain of the
                      Lord's host, comes down to direct the battle."—The Desire of
                     Ages, p. 352.
                        What was the advantage to the disciples that Christ would
                      depart to heaven and send His Holy Spirit?
                        "The Holy Spirit is Christ's representative, but divested of the
                     personality of humanity, and independent thereof. Cumbered
                      with humanity, Christ could not be in every place personally.
                     Therefore it was for their interest that He should go to the
                     Father, and send the Spirit to be His successor on earth. No one
                     could then have any advantage because of his location or his
                     personal contact with Christ. By the Spirit the Saviour would be
                     accessible to all. In this sense He would be nearer to them than if
                     He had not ascended on high."—The Desire of Ages, p. 669.
                        What other benefit would the children of God receive from the
                     Holy Spirit after Christ's ascension?
                        " 'It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the
                     Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send Him
                     unto you.' John 16:7. Henceforth through the Spirit, Christ was
                     to abide continually in the hearts of His children. Their union
                     with Him was closer than when He was personally with
                     them."—Steps to Christ, p. 75.
                        In this way we can put into practice the counsel of Christ:
                     "Abide in me, and I in you.... He that abideth in me, and I in him,
                     the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do
                     nothing" (John 15:4, 5). The only way for Christ to abide in us is
                     through the Holy Spirit. The only way we can abide in Him is by
                     accepting His promise through faith, studying His word, and
                     living a life of prayer.

THINK IT THROUGH       Why is it important for the Christian to have the Holy Spirit in
                     his life?

                       "Through the Spirit the believer becomes a partaker of the
                     divine nature. Christ has given His Spirit as a divine power to
                     overcome all hereditary and cultivated tendencies to evil, and to
                     impress His own character upon His church."—The Desire of

The Holy Spirit     LESSON 7                                        ❑ Wednesday
                                                                       August 15

         Part 4       What is the prime function of the Holy Spirit in the world?
   FUNCTIONS-1
                      "When he [the Holy Spirit] is come, he will reprove the world
                    of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment" (John 16:8).

                      Of sin The first work of the Holy Spirit is to convict of sin, thus
                    producing real repentance. If it were not for His silent and
                    effective promptings, no heart would be reproved of sin. On the
                    Day of Pentecost a great multitude was convicted and exclaimed:
                    "Men and brethren, what shall we do? Then Peter said unto
                    them, Repent, and be baptized" (Acts 2:37, 38).
                       Of righteousness. The Spirit convicts of righteousness, that
                    is, He invites man to accept the imputed and the imparted
                    righteousness of Christ. He shows that Jesus was righteous and
                    His cause was vindicated (John 16:10).
                       Of judgment. The Holy Spirit warns man of a judgment to
                    come, and awakens in his mind the desire to yield his life to
                    Christ. In fact, Satan has already been judged at the cross, and
                    the sinner can expect only condemnation (v. 11).

                      Describe another function of the Holy Spirit. John 14:26;
                    16:13.

                       Another very important work of the Spirit is to lead the mind in
                    the study of the Word of God, guiding the student into all truth. It
                    is amazing to see the Spirit in action while we study the Word.
                    He prevents us from falling into errors and opens up new under-
                    standings of truth. Further, He speaks to our hearts, pointing
                    out our spiritual needs, showing us new areas of truth, and
                    enlarging our spiritual vision.
                       Through the leadership and the work of the Spirit of God our
                    forefathers discovered and treasured truth after truth. Naturally
                    they had a humble and teachable spirit, and they combined the
                    hard study and thinking with fervent prayer.

                      Discover another and related mission of the Spirit. See John
                    14:26 and Mark 13:11.

                      It is really encouraging to see how, in moments of necessity or
                    emergency, the Holy Spirit has illuminated the minds of the
                    children of God, reminding them of things already studied. In
                    these last days, when many of us may be called to give an
                    explanation or a testimony of our faith before rulers and courts
                    of justice, these verses present a comforting promise and a
                    wonderful assurance.

 THINK IT THROUGH    What ought Ito be doing now if the Spirit is going to recall to
                    my mind important truths in an emergency?

The Holy Spirit        LESSON 7                                         ❑ Thursday
                                                                         August 16
             Part 5     How does the Holy Spirit help us in our prayer life?
       FUNCTIONS-2
                        "In the same way the Spirit comes to the aid of our weak-
                      ness. We do not even know how we ought to pray, but through
                      our inarticulate groans the Spirit himself is pleading for us,
                      and God who searches our inmost being knows what the Spirit
                      means, because he pleads for God's people in God's own
                      way" (Rom. 8:26, 27, NEB).

                         With our limited knowledge and human weaknesses, with our
                      ignorance in regard to the future, we are not able to pray for the
                      right things in the right way. But the Spirit, who prompts us to
                      pray, also shows us our spiritual needs and indicates what we
                      should pray for. Also He interprets our petitions before the
                      Father and makes them meaningful. So when we pray with
                      complete submission to God, the Spirit perfects that prayer and
                      intercedes on our behalf. God may not answer our prayers by
                      giving us precisely what we ask for, since that may not be to our
                      benefit. But He will answer the perfected and interpreted prayer
                      of the Comforter, who knows our needs and knows also the will
                      of God.
                         The Three Persons of the Godhead are actively helping us in
                      every sincere prayer. We pray in the name of the Son to the
                      Father, and the Holy Spirit adds His intercession.

                        What is another function of the Holy Spirit in the Christian
                      experience? Rom. 8:16.

                        He gives us the assurance and bears witness that we are
                      children of God. What a beautiful and comforting certainty!

                       Another mission of the Spirit is very important. What is it?
                      Gal. 5:22, 23; John 3:5.

                         "When the Spirit of God takes possession of the heart, it
                      transforms the life. Sinful thoughts are put away, evil deeds are
                      renounced; love, humility, and peace take the place of anger,
                      envy, and strife. Joy takes the place of sadness, and the counte-
                      nance reflects the light of heaven. No one sees the hand that lifts
                      the burden, or beholds the light descend from the courts above.
                      The blessing comes when by faith the soul surrenders itself to
                      God. Then that power which no human eye can see creates a
                      new being in the image of God."—The Desire of Ages, p. 173.

           Part 6     Where does the Holy Spirit like to dwell?
       PRESENCE
      IN THE LIFE    "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the
                    Spirit of God dwelleth in you? If any man defile the temple of
                    God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy,
                    which temple ye are" (1 Cor. 3:16, 17).

                       God wants to abide in us through His Holy Spirit. He wants to
                    make each of us a temple in which His Spirit may abide. He
                    knocks at the door of our hearts. He longs to come in, to be with
                    us permanently, blessing us with His wonderful presence.
                       The only way in which we can avail ourselves of the blessed
                    and multiple ministry of the Holy Spirit is by receiving Him in our
                    lives every day by faith through prayer and the study of the
                    Word.

                     How willing is God to bestow the Holy Spirit on His children?
                    On what condition? Luke 11:13; Rev. 3:20.

                       The only condition is that of asking and receiving. God will
                    not force His way into the heart. He stands outside and knocks,
                    and only if we open the door will He come in and sup with us.
                       "This promised blessing [the Holy Spirit], claimed by faith,
                    brings all other blessings in its train. It is given according to the
                    riches of the grace of Christ, and He is ready to supply every soul
                    according to the capacity to receive."—The Desire of Ages, p.
                    672.

                      Before Jesus ascended, how did He empower the disci-
                    ples? John 20:22, 23.

                      Jesus not only promised the Holy Spirit (John 16:7) but he
                    breathed the Holy Spirit upon them. The Christian is not only
                    one who follows Christ, but he is one who has the Holy Spirit
                    directing and controlling in his life.

 THINK IT THROUGH     When and how does the Holy Spirit come into the life?

                      "There are many who profess to believe and claim the Lord's
                    promises; they talk about Christ and the Holy Spirit; yet they
                    receive no benefit, because they do not surrender their souls to
                    the guidance and control of divine agencies."—Gospel Work-

                                                                            August 19
             Part 1     What three tasks of the Holy Spirit did Jesus point out?
        CONVICTING
           POWER         "When he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of
                      righteousness, and of judgment" (John 16:8).

                        The Holy Spirit has a threefold task. First of all He convicts
                      man of his sin. The sense of guilt is evidence of the work of the
                      Holy Spirit. But He doesn't stop there. He goes on to show how a
                      man can be right with God. This is possible only through Christ.
                      And then He points out that the one who refuses to accept God's
                      plan of salvation has to face a judgment. But the first step is a
                      crucial one, for each of us must recognize that he is a sinner
                      before he desires to accept the Saviour.

                        What happened to those who heard Peter's sermon at
                      Pentecost? Acts 2:37.

                         Peter minced no words in telling the audience that they had
                      crucified the One whom God had made Lord and Christ (v. 36).
                      He was speaking with the convicting power of the Holy Spirit
                      and immediately they cried out: "What shall we do?"
                         "The arguments of the apostles alone, though clear and con-
                      vincing, would not have removed the prejudice that had with-
                      stood so much evidence. But the Holy Spirit sent the arguments
                      home to hearts with divine power. The words of the apostles
                      were as sharp arrows of the Almighty, convicting men of their
                      terrible guilt in rejecting and crucifying the Lord of glory."—The
                      Acts of the Apostles, p. 45.
                         "When sin has deadened the moral. perceptions, the wrong-
                      doer does not discern the defects of his character nor realize
                      the enormity of the evil he has committed; and unless he yields
                      to the convicting power of the Holy Spirit he remains in partial
                      blindness to his sin."—Steps to Christ, p. 40.
                         Why is the convicting power of the Holy Spirit so important?
                         "If the sinner responds to the quickening influence of the
                      Spirit, he will be brought to repentance and aroused to the
                      importance of obeying the divine requirements.... The Spirit is
                      given as a regenerating agency, to make effectual the salvation
                      wrought by the death of our Redeemer. . . . Having brought
                      conviction of sin, and presented before the mind the standard of
                      righteousness, the Holy Spirit withdraws the affections from the
                      things of this earth and fills the soul with a desire for holiness."

          Part 2     What provision has Jesus made that He would be with His
     INDWELLING    disciples after His ascension?
         POWER
                     "I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Com-
                   forter, that he may abide with you for ever; ... he dwelleth with
                   you, and shall be in you" (John 14:16, 17).

                     "In describing to His disciples the office work of the Holy
                   Spirit, Jesus sought to inspire them with the joy and hope that
                   inspired His own heart. He rejoiced because of the abundant
                   help He had provided for His church. . . . It is the Spirit that
                   makes effectual what has been wrought out by the world's
                   Redeemer. It is by the Spirit that the heart is made pure."—The

                     What are some of the advantages of having the Holy Spirit in
                   the life? John 3:3; Gal. 5:22, 23; John 16:13,

                      The advantages may be summarized as follows:
                      1. We are born again and can see the kingdom of God. John
                   3:3.
                      2. We produce the peaceable fruit of the Spirit. John 15:4, 5;
                   Gal. 5:22, 23.
                      3. We are guided into all truth. John 16:13.
                      4. Our prayers are made effective. Rom. 8:26.
                      5. We have companionship and advice so that we are never
                   lonely or frustrated. John 14:16-18. (See NIV.)
                      "At all times and in all places, in all sorrows and in all afflic-
                   tions, when the outlook seems dark and the future perplexing,
                   and we feel helpless and alone, the Comforter will be sent in
                   answer to the prayer of faith. Circumstances may separate us
                   from every earthly friend; but no circumstance, no distance, can
                   separate us from the heavenly Comforter. Wherever we are,
                   wherever we may go, He is always at our right hand to support,

                   heart?

                     "The Holy Spirit never leaves unassisted the soul who is
                   looking unto Jesus. He takes of the things of Christ and shows
                   them unto him. If the eye is kept fixed on Christ, the work of the
                   Spirit ceases not until the soul is conformed to His image."—

           Part 3     What kind of baptism did Jesus promise His disciples?
        ENABLING
          POWER       "John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized
                    with the Holy Ghost not many days hence" (Acts 1:5).

                      "Christ's visible presence was about to be withdrawn from
                    the disciples, but a new endowment of power was to be theirs.
                    The Holy Spirit was to be given them in its fullness, sealing them
                    for their work."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 30.

                     For what purpose did Christ promise to send His Holy Spirit?
                    Acts 1:8.

                       The gift of the Holy Spirit was to enable the children of God to
                     witness effectively for their Master.
                        "The work committed to the disciples would require great
                    efficiency; for the tide of evil ran deep and strong against them.
                    A vigilant, determined leader was in command of the forces of
                    darkness, and the followers of Christ could battle for the right
                    only through the help that God, by His Spirit, would give
                    them."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 31.
                       Sometimes the Spirit will confer upon some people special
                    gifts or talents like the ones mentioned in First Corinthians 12.
                    The important thing is that, with miraculous gifts or without
                    them, every child of God needs to bear witness to Jesus by his
                    life and his spoken testimony.

                      How did the Holy Spirit endow the early disciples for witness-
                    ing? Acts 2:4-11.

                      In order to witness quickly to the whole world with its many
                    languages, the disciples had to have the gift of tongues.
                      "The Holy Spirit did for them that which they could not have
                    accomplished for themselves in a lifetime. They could now
                    proclaim the truths of the gospel abroad, speaking with accu-
                    racy the languages of those for whom they were laboring. This
                    miraculous gift was a strong evidence to the world that their
                    commission bore the signet of Heaven. From this time forth the
                    language of the disciples was pure, simple, and accurate,
                    whether they spoke in their native tongue or in a foreign
                    language."—The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 39, 40.

THINK IT THROUGH      Why do you think God uses men rather than angels in pro-
                    claiming the gospel?

                      "The spirit of unselfish labor for others gives depth, stability,
                    and Christlike loveliness to the character, and brings peace and
                    happiness to its possessor."—Steps to Christ, p. 80.

           Part 4     Upon whom does God say He will pour out His Holy Spirit in
 THE LATTER RAIN    the last days?

                      "I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and
                    your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream
                    dreams, your young men shall see visions: and also upon the
                    servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out
                    my spirit" (Joel 2:28, 29).

                       Read also Acts 2:16-21.
                       The outpouring of the Holy Spirit is illustrated in the Bible as
                    the early and the latter rain. (See Zech. 10:1; Joel 2:23.)
                       "The outpouring of the Spirit in the days of the apostles was
                    the beginning of the early, or former, rain, and glorious was the
                    result. . . .
                       "But near the close of the earth's harvest, a special bestowal
                    of spiritual grace is promised to prepare the church for the

                    last days? Zech. 4:6.

                     What encouraging assurance are we given that the whole
                    world will be evangelized, and how? Rev. 18:1, 4.

                       "It is with an earnest longing that I look forward to the time
                    when the events of the Day of Pentecost shall be repeated with
                    even greater power than on that occasion. . .. Then, as at the
                    Pentecostal season, the people will hear the truth spoken to
                    them, every man in his own tongue.

                    sires to serve Him, and can touch the lips with a live coal from off
                    the altar, and cause them to become eloquent with His praise.
                    Thousands of voices will be imbued with the power to speak
                    forth the wonderful truths of God's Word. The stammering

          Part 5     How willing is God to give the Holy Spirit to those who ask
      RECEIVING    Him?
      THE SPIRIT
                     "If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your
                   children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the
                   Holy Spirit to them that ask Him" (Luke 11:13).

                     God does not withhold the gift of the Holy Spirit from a
                   person. But we are slow to ask for the gift, slow to recognize our
                   need of Him, slow to appropriate the gift in order to live the
                   victorious life.

                     To how many is the Spirit of God promised? Acts 2:39.

                      "The promise of the Holy Spirit is not limited to any age or to
                   any race. Christ declared that the divine influence of His Spirit
                   was to be with His followers unto the end."—The Acts of the
                   Apostles, p. 49.
                     Thus the Spirit of God instructed Moses and the children of
                   Israel (Neh. 9:20). Caleb and Joshua were men of the Spirit,
                   undaunted by the heathen and their cities in Canaan (Num.
                   14:24; 27:18). The true church in the Middle Ages in Europe,
                   during the Reformation, and in our own day is led by men of the
                   Spirit. Men and women down through the centuries have de-
                   cided between truth and falsehood; and when they have placed
                   themselves on the side of God, God has been with them through
                   the Holy Spirit.

                     Are there any conditions for receiving the Holy Spirit? Acts
                   5:32.

                      We must obey Him. He wants to use us, to lead our lives, to
                   encourage us to do good things, and to eliminate bad habits
                   and feelings. The Spirit remains in our lives only as we obey
                   Him. If we disregard His promptings and His biddings, we grieve
                   Him (Eph. 4:30), and He withdraws from us.
                      "As the disciples waited for the fulfillment of the promise [of
                   the Spirit], they humbled their hearts in true repentance and
                   confessed their unbelief. As they called to remembrance the
                   words that Christ had spoken to them before His death they
                   understood more fully their meaning. Truths which had passed
                   from their memory were again brought to their minds, and these
                   they repeated to one another."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 36.
                      The more we pray for the Spirit and yield our lives to God, the
                   more the Spirit is able to perfect our characters.

                                                                          August 24
          Part 6     What is an essential condition of receiving the promise of
        A DAILY    the Holy Spirit?
     EXPERIENCE
                     "That we might receive the promise of the Spirit through
                   faith" (Gal. 3:14).

                     As in the case of other spiritual blessings, faith is an indis-
                   pensable requisite of receiving the Spirit. Many times, de-
                   pressed by the feeling of our own sinfulness and unworthiness,
                   we do not dare to ask for the Spirit with fervor and enthusiasm.
                   Or if we pray for this gift, we do so as a formal thing, without faith
                   in the fulfillment of the promise.
                     The secret of receiving is believing. This is true of forgiveness
                   of sin, acceptance by Christ, reception of the Holy Spirit.
                   "Therefore I say unto you," said Jesus, "What things soever ye
                   desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall
                   have them" (Mark 11:24). When faith lays hold of the promise of
                   God, the Lord supplies the fact. But the promise should be
                   claimed by faith. God does not grant any spiritual good accord-
                   ing to our goodness or to our own merits, because we have
                   none. He gives us what we need according to His mercy, in the
                   name of His Son, because He loves us and honors our faith.
                      "At this very hour His Spirit and His grace are for all who need
                   them and will take Him at His word. . . .
                      "The disciples did not ask for a blessing for themselves. They
                   were weighted with the burden of souls. The gospel was to be
                   carried to the ends of the earth, and they claimed the endow-
                   ment of power that Christ had promised. Then it was that the
                   Holy Spirit was poured out. . . .
                      "So it may be now. Let Christians put away all dissension and
                   give themselves to God for the saving of the lost. Let them ask in
                   faith for the promised blessing, and it will come."—Testimonies,
                   vol. 8, pp. 20, 21.

                     How important is the power of Christ to the believer? John
                   15:5.

                     "Morning by morning, as the heralds of the gospel kneel
                   before the Lord and renew their vows of consecration to Him,
                   He will grant them the presence of His Spirit, with its reviving,
                   sanctifying power. As they go forth to the day's duties, they have
                   the assurance that the unseen agency of the Holy Spirit enables
                   them to be 'laborers together with God.' "—The Acts of the

            Part 1     Describe what happened on the Day of Pentecost.
     THE HISTORIC
       EARLY RAIN      "When the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all
                     with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a
                     sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all
                     the house where they were sitting. And there appeared unto
                     them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of
                     them. And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began
                     to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utter-
                     ance" (Acts 2:1-4).

                       Peter asserts that this experience was a fulfillment of the
                     prophecy of Joel (v.16). Whereas in Old Testament times people
                     were dependent on their leaders for spiritual guidance, in the
                     New Testament times people would have direct access to a
                     knowledge of the truth through the Holy Spirit.
                        The figure of pouring out the Spirit is a striking one. It is taken
                     from the climatic conditions of Palestine where vegetation is
                     dependent on the early and the latter rains. These rains could be
                     torrents at times. The early rain came in October and November,
                     at the sowing time, and the latter rain came in March and April
                     when the grain was ready to fill out.
                       It is also remarkable how quickly vegetation grows out of
                     parched ground when some rain falls. Isaiah refers to the pour-
                     ing out of the Spirit upon people, and compares the result to the
                     marvel of seeing the wilderness become a fruitful field. God is
                     saying that His people are as good as dead unless they receive
                     His Spirit. When they receive the Holy Spirit, then their lives can
                     blossom as the rose.

                       What were some of the amazing results of Pentecost? Acts
                     2:41-43, 46, 47.

                        "Under the training of Christ the disciples had been led to feel
                     their need of the Spirit. Under the Spirit's teaching they received
                     the final qualification, and went forth to their lifework. No longer
                     were they ignorant and uncultured."—The Acts of the Apostles,
                     p. 45.
                        "The glad tidings of a risen Saviour were carried to the utter-
                     most parts of the inhabited world. As the disciples proclaimed
                     the message of redeeming grace, hearts yielded to the power of
                     this message. The church beheld converts flocking to her from
                     all directions. Backsliders were reconverted. Sinners united
                     with believers in seeking the pearl of great price. Some who had
                     been the bitterest opponents of the gospel became its
                     champions."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 48.

          Part 2   In what words did the prophet Joel convey God's promise of
    PROMISES OF the latter rain?
     THE LATTER
           RAIN    "Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the Lord
                 your God: for he hath given you the former rain moderately,
                 and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former
                 rain, and the latter rain in the first month" (Joel 2:23).

                       God had promised Israel that if they were faithful to Him He
                    would give them rain at the proper time. (See Deut. 28:12.) But if
                    Israel were unfaithful to Him and did not recognize that He was
                    the source of all blessings, He would then send a drought, as in
                    the days of Elijah. (See 1 Kings 17:1.) Then the people would
                    recognize that God alone was the source of the blessing of rain.
                    (See Jer. 14:22.)

                      What assurance is there from the early rain that there will be
                    a latter rain? Hosea 6:3.

                      God may have to delay His promises when His people are not
                    ready, but His purposes "know no haste and no delay"—The
                    Desire of Ages, p. 32. "When the fulness of the time was come,
                    God sent forth His Son," and when the time comes for the latter
                    rain to be poured out, its effect will be clearly manifest.

                      What are some of the signs that indicate the time when the
                    latter rain will be due? Joel 2:30, 31.

                      Just as the early church could not have grown without the
                    experience at Pentecost, so the work of God cannot be finished
                    in the last days without a mighty outpouring of the Holy Spirit.
                       "These scenes are to be repeated, and with greater power.
                    The outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost was
                    the former rain, but the latter rain will be more abundant"—

                      What will be some of the results of the latter rain?

                      "Servants of God, with their faces lighted up and shining with
                    holy consecration, will hasten from place to place to proclaim
                    the message from heaven. By thousands of voices, all over the

           Part 3   In what prophetic terms is the latter rain and its glorious
     PURPOSE OF results described?
 THE LATTER RAIN    "After these things I saw another angel come down from
                  heaven, having great power; and the earth was lighted with
                  his glory.
                    "And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out
                  of her [fallen Babylon], my people, that ye be not partakers of
                  her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues" (Rev. 18:1, 4).

                        The angel of Revelation 18 who lights the whole world with
                     the glory of God does not represent a new message, additional
                      to the three of Revelation 14, but a new power added to the
                     proclamation of the three messages; namely, the power of the
                     Holy Spirit through the pouring out of the latter rain.
                        What are the two main purposes of the latter rain?
                        1.To finish the work of God on earth.
                        2. To prepare the saints for the time of trouble.
                        "At that time the 'latter rain,' or refreshing from the presence
                     of the Lord, will come, to give power to the loud voice of the

The Early and the Latter Rains            LESSON 9                   ❑ Wednesday
                                                                        August 29
           Part 4     How does the prophet encourage us to plead with God for
  IMPORTANCE OF     the reception of the latter rain?
 THE LATTER RAIN
                      "Ask ye of the Lord rain in the time of the latter rain; so the
                    Lord shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain,
                    to every one grass in the field" (Zech. 10:1).

                      If it were not of vital importance for the individual Christian
                    and for the church at large to receive the latter rain, we would
                    not find this emphatic encouragement.
                      Just as the rain softens the ground and prepares it for plowing
                    so that the seed can be sown, so the Holy Spirit prepares the
                    ground of our hearts for the seed of the Word. And just as the
                    latter rain enables the crop to develop so that there will be a rich
                    harvest, so the Holy Spirit causes the individual to bring forth
                    fruit in his life and ministry that will mean the finishing of God's
                    work on the earth.
                       "This promised blessing, claimed by faith, brings all other
                    blessings in its train."—Gospel Workers, p. 285.

                     How earnestly should we pray for the outpouring of the Holy
                    Spirit? Joel 2:12, 13.

                      The rending of the garment was a Semitic custom indicating
                    concern. (See Jer. 36:24.) Joel is saying that we should not be
                    concerned in a superficial or external sense, but in a real sense,
                    with our hearts torn because of the situation we find our-
                    selves in.
                       "It is not because of any restriction on the part of God that the
                    riches of His grace do not flow earthward to men. If all were
                    willing to receive, all would become filled with His Spirit."—
                    Christ's Object Lessons, p. 419.
                       "The descent of the Holy Spirit upon the church is looked
                    forward to as in the future; but it is the privilege of the church to
                    have it now. Seek for it, pray for it, believe for it. We must have it,
                    and Heaven is waiting to bestow it."—Evangelism, p. 701.
                       "At this very hour His Spirit and His grace are for all who need
                    them and will take Him at His word."—Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 20.
                       "I have no specific time of which to speak when the outpour-
                    ing of the Holy Spirit will take place—when the mighty angel will
                    come down from heaven, and unite with the third angel in
                    closing up the work for this world."—Selected Messages, bk. 1,

The Early and the Latter Rains            LESSON 9                    ❑ Thursday
                                                                       August 30
         Part 5   "If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble
     REASON FOR themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their
         DELAY wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive
                their sin, and will heal their land" (2 Chron. 7:14).

                     Many of God's promises are conditional on obedience. When
                   God's people obey Him with all their hearts, there is no doubt
                   about the blessings that will be bestowed.
                     At all times God has been anxious to bestow upon His chil-
                   dren His choicest blessings, including the gift of the Holy Spirit.
                   But the people of God have not been ready to receive the
                   heavenly gifts.
                     God never intrudes into the human heart. He never violates
                   the will. In order for Him to come down from heaven and bless
                   us, either individually or collectively, we must feel our need of
                   Him, and we must be ready. By His grace we must empty our-
                   selves of all the sinful practices that prevent us from receiving
                   His presence and His Spirit. We must open the door and fulfill
                   certain conditions.

                     What practical request does the Lord make of us? Prov.
                   23:26.

                     The heart represents our inner being. It determines where we
                   go and what we do. (See Prov. 4:23.) It is safe only when we
                   place it in the hands of God. (See Prov. 3:5.) Can it be that we fail
                   to enjoy the full blessings of God because we have not surren-
                   dered our hearts fully to Him?

                     What warning does the wise man give us? Prov. 14:12.

                     Could it be that our knowledge is purely intellectual? "With-
                   out the Spirit of God a knowledge of His word is of no avail. The
                   theory of truth, unaccompanied by the Holy Spirit, cannot
                   quicken the soul or sanctify the heart. One may be familiar with
                   the commands and promises of the Bible; but unless the Spirit
                   of God sets the truth home, the character will not be trans-
                   formed. Without the enlightenment of the Spirit, men will not be
                   able to distinguish truth from error, and they will fall under the
                   masterful temptations of Satan."—Christ's Object Lessons, pp.
                   408, 411.
                     "The Spirit works upon man's heart, according to his desire
                   and consent implanting in him a new nature."—Christ's Object
                   Lessons, p. 411.

THINK IT THROUGH     What can I do to hasten and make possible the outpouring
                   of the latter rain, both in the church and in my own personal
                   experience?

                                                                           August 31
           Part 6   How did Jesus emphasize the concept of a growing Chris-
       EARLY AND tian experience?
     LATTER RAIN
      EXPERIENCE    "The earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then
                  the ear, after that the full corn in the ear" (Mark 4:28).

                      Jesus pointed out that spiritual growth is very much like the
                    growth of plants in nature; there are various stages of develop-
                    ment; there is a logical sequence. Theologians tend to make
                    Bible truths difficult to comprehend, but the fact is that there is a
                    simplicity about Christian growth that even a child can grasp.
                      There is the seed planted in the ground—the word of God in
                    the heart. The seed dies, but a new plant springs up—the old
                    man dies, but the Christian rises to walk in newness of life.
                    There are roots that must go deep for stable nourishment and a
                    stem that must be sheltered at first, but later will be able to stand
                    up to the winds of strife. There will be need for the water of life;
                    and then the fruit will appear in its season, fruit that will bring joy
                    and nourishment to others. Throughout the existence, from
                    germination to harvest, the power of God has been at work; so
                    the tree or plant cannot claim any glory to itself.
                      "It is God's rain and air and sunshine" that cause the plants to
                    grow. "It is God who is every day feeding millions from earth's
                    harvest fields. Men are called upon to co-operate with God in
                    the care of the grain and the preparation of the loaf, and be-
                    cause of this they lose sight of the divine agency. They do not
                    give God the glory due unto His holy name."—The Desire of
                    Ages, pp. 367, 368.

                      Why is the experience of the early and latter rain needed?

                      "Divine grace is needed at the beginning, divine grace at
                    every step of advance, and divine grace alone can complete the
                    work. There is no place for us to rest in a careless attitude. We
                    must never forget the warnings of Christ, 'Watch unto prayer,'
                    'Watch, . . . and pray always.' A connection with the divine
                    agency every moment is essential to our progress. We may have
                    had a measure of the Spirit of God, but by prayer and faith we
                    are continually to seek more of the Spirit. It will never do to
                    cease our efforts. If we do not progress, if we do not place
                    ourselves in an attitude to receive both the former and the latter
                    rain, we shall lose our souls, and the responsibility will lie at our
                    own door."—Testimonies to Ministers, p. 508.

                        If we ask fervently for something, it is because we appreciate

   Conditions for Receiving
. the Latter Rain LESSON 10                                            ❑ Monday
                                                                      September 3
           Part 2      How did the apostle Peter express a condition of receiving
      REPENTANCE     the Holy Spirit?
  AND CONVERSION
                       "Repent therefore, and turn again, that your sins may be
                     blotted out, that times of refreshing may come from the pres-
                     ence of the Lord" (Acts 3:19, RSV).

                       Peter points out that repentance and conversion will bring
                     forgiveness of sins and times of refreshing. God sends rest to
                     the weary, peace to the troubled, a surge of new life to those
                     who are exhausted, whenever they recognize their sinfulness
                     and turn to Him for forgiveness. There is no peace like the peace
                     which Jesus gives. (See John 14:27.)

                       How important is conversion to the Christian? Matt. 18:3.

                        "Many have in a great measure failed to receive the former
                     rain. They have not obtained all the benefits that God has thus
                     provided for them. They expect that the lack will be supplied by
                     the latter rain. When the richest abundance of grace shall be
                     bestowed, they intend to open their hearts to receive it. They are
                     making a terrible mistake. The work that God has begun in the
                     human heart in giving His light and knowledge must be con-
                     tinually going forward. Every individual must realize his own
                     necessity. The heart must be emptied of every defilement and
                     cleansed for the indwelling of the Spirit. It was by the confession
                     and forsaking of sin, by earnest prayer and consecration of
                     themselves to God, that the early disciples prepared for the
                     outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the Day of Pentecost. . .. But
                     there must be no neglect of the grace represented by the former
                     rain. Only those who are living up to the light they have will
                     receive greater light. Unless we are daily advancing in the
                     exemplification of the active Christian virtues, we shall not
                     recognize the manifestations of the Holy Spirit in the latter rain.
                     It may be falling on hearts all around us, but we shall not discern
                     or receive it."—Testimonies to Ministers, p. 507.
                        "There are some who, instead of wisely improving present
                     opportunities, are idly waiting for some special season of
                     spiritual refreshing by which their ability to enlighten others will
                     be greatly increased. They neglect present duties and
                     privileges, and allow their light to burn dim, while they look
                     forward to a time when, without any effort on their part, they will
                     be made the recipients of special blessing, by which they will be
                     transformed and fitted for service."The Acts of the Apostles,

Conditions for Receiving
the Latter Rain LESSON 10                                               ❑ Tuesday
                                                                       September 4
           Part 3     What does Peter say is a condition of receiving the Holy
       OBEDIENCE    Spirit into the life?

                      "We are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the
                    Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him"
                    (Acts 5:32).

                      The context of this verse indicates that Peter was telling the
                    Jewish leaders that they were a disobedient group, and so the
                    Holy Spirit was not with them. No wonder they were "cut to the
                    heart" (v. 33)!
                      Ideally, there is a close connection between the church and
                    the Holy Spirit; so a lie to the church is a lie to the Holy Spirit
                    (Acts 5:3), and an action of the church is in fact an act of the Holy
                    Spirit (Acts 15:28). But all this is dependent on absolute obedi-
                    ence on the part of the members.

                      What is implicit in obedience, according to Peter? 1 Peter
                    1:14, 22. According to Paul? 2 Cor. 10:5.

                        Christ and the Holy Spirit come to our lives in order to guide
                    us and rule our thoughts, plans, and acts according to the will of
                    God. As soon as the Spirit comes to us, He begins to guide us. If
                    we gladly and willingly obey, we make it possible for the Spirit to
                    remain in us, becoming our Lord. The life begins to be cleansed
                    from all unrighteousness and defilement, and we become
                    happy media to convey the good news to others who come in
                    contact with us. But if we are not willing to surrender self, and
                    we ignore the overtures of the Spirit, and we want to use Him
                    instead of His guiding us, He is grieved and departs from us.
                        "Christ has promised the gift of the Holy Spirit to His church,
                    and the promise belongs to us as much as to the first disciples.
                    But like every other promise, it is given on conditions. There are
                    many who believe and profess to claim the Lord's promise; they
                    talk about Christ and about the Holy Spirit, yet receive no bene-
                    fit. They do not surrender the soul to be guided and controlled
                    by the divine agencies. We cannot use the Holy Spirit. The Spirit
                    is to use us. Through the Spirit God works in His people 'to will
                    and to do of His good pleasure.' Phil. 2:13. But many will not
                    submit to this. They want to manage themselves. This is why
                    they do not receive the heavenly gift. Only to those who wait
                    humbly upon God, who watch for His guidance and grace, is the
                    Spirit given."—The Desire of Ages, p. 672.

Conditions for Receiving
the Latter Rain LESSON 10                                         ❑ Wednesday
                                                                    September 5
          Part 4   What is the privilege that may be enjoyed by every Chris-
   WILLINGNESS tian?
    TO WITNESS
                   "But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is
                 come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in
                 Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the
                 uttermost part of the earth" (Acts 1:8).

                     Jesus called His disciples and then sent them to preach. (See
                   Luke 10:1.) He endowed them with power so that they per-
                   formed miracles (v. 9). They came back rejoicing and reported
                   their successes. (See v. 17.) But Jesus warned them that they
                   were not to take pride in their victories over the evil one. Rather,
                   they were to rejoice that their names were written in heaven.
                   (See v. 20.)
                     The Christian is empowered from on high to witness. He does
                   not claim any credit for himself. But it is his privilege to be used
                   of God, and it is the close connection he has with his Master that
                   gives him joy and satisfaction.

                     How did Jesus perform His ministry as one who was sent?
                   John 4:34; 9:4.

                     Jesus represented His Father completely. He spoke His words
                   and performed His deeds. There was an urgency about His work
                   that sets for us an example of supreme dedication.
                     The purpose of God in the outpouring of the Spirit in the latter
                   rain is to bestow the needed power to His children that they may
                   witness for Christ and finish the proclamation of the gospel in
                   the world. Only as we fervently pray for the showers of grace will
                   they come. The finishing of God's work on earth is one of the
                   prime objectives of the Christian life. This gives urgency to our
                   prayers for the latter rain.
                      "The great outpouring of the Spirit of God, which lightens the
                   whole earth with His glory, will not come until we have an
                   enlightened people, that know by experience what it means to
                   be laborers together with God. When we have entire, whole-
                   hearted consecration to the service of Christ, God will recog-
                   nize the fact by an outpouring of His Spirit without measure; but
                   this will not be while the largest portion of the church are not
                   laborers together with God."—Christian Service, p. 253. (Re-

                                                                         September 6
           Part 5     What special spiritual condition of the disciples made it
           UNITY    possible for God to answer their prayers for the outpouring of
                    His Spirit on the Day of Pentecost?

                       "And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were
                     all with one accord in one place" (Acts 2:1).

                      Jesus had told His disciples to wait in Jerusalem, and they
                    waited. But they did not spend their time in idleness. They were
                    "continually in the temple, praising and blessing God." (Luke
                    24:53). They spent time in prayer, their faith increasing day by
                    day as they contemplated the work of their ascended Lord. They
                    reviewed their past experiences, confessed their failures, and
                    pleaded for forgiveness. They wanted to be fit to be witnesses,
                    and they drew closer to one another as they sought to draw
                    closer to God. Very soon they forgot their differences, their
                    conflicting amibitions. Now in "one accord," they were ready
                    for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. (See The Acts of the
                    Apostles, pp. 35-37.)

                      What kind of unity did Jesus pray His disciples might enjoy?
                    John 17:21.

                       "He longs to pour upon us His Holy Spirit in rich measure, and
                    He bids us clear the way by self-renunciation. When self is
                    surrendered to God, our eyes will be opened to see the stum-
                    bling stones which our un-Christlikeness has placed in the way
                    of others. All these God bids us remove. He says: 'Confess your
                    faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be
                    healed.' James 5:16."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 43.
                       "When one is fully emptied of self, when every false god is
                    cast out of the soul, the vacuum is filled by the inflowing of the
                    Spirit of Christ."—Gospel Workers, p. 287.
                      "There is no limit to the usefulness of the one who, putting
                    self aside, makes room for the working of the Holy Spirit upon
                    his heart, and lives a life wholly consecrated to God."—
                    Christian Service, p. 254.

THINK IT THROUGH      How can I empty myself of self?

                      :'No man can empty himself of self. We can only consent for
                    Christ to accomplish the work. Then the language of the soul
                    will be, Lord, take my heart; for I cannot give it. It is Thy property.
                    Keep it pure, for I cannot keep it for Thee. Save me in spite of
                    myself, my weak, un-Christlike self. Mold me, fashion me, raise
                    me into a pure and holy atmosphere, where the rich current of
                    Thy love can flow through my soul."—Christ's Object Lessons,

                                                                    September 7
          Parl 6     What was the basis of acceptance into the church?
     RECEPTION
     AND BELIEF      "They that gladly received his [Peter's] word were baptized:
                   and the same day there were added unto them about three
                   thousand souls."
                     "Many of them which heard the word believed; and the
                   number of the men was about five thousand" (Acts 2:41; 4:4).

                     The message of the preacher must be compared with Scrip-
                   ture so as to confirm its truth. It must then be believed and
                   applied in the life. (See Acts 17:11, 12 for the example of the
                   Bereans.) Only in this way can one become a true member of the
                   church and a recipient of the Holy Spirit.

                     How does James emphasize the importance of faith?
                   James 1:6, 7.

                     "Men, women, and youth, God requires you to possess moral
                   courage, steadiness of purpose, fortitude and perseverance,
                   minds that cannot take the assertions of another, but which will
                   investigate for themselves before receiving or rejecting, that
                   will study and weigh evidence, and take it to the Lord in
                   prayer."—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 130.
                     "Let Christians put away all dissension and give themselves
                   to God for the saving of the lost. Let them ask in faith for the
                   promised blessing, and it will come. The outpouring of the Spirit
                   in the days of the apostles was 'the former rain,' and glorious
                   was the result. But the latter rain will be more abundant"—
                   Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 21.

                     What other characteristic does James say is important?
                   James 5:7, 8.

                     The Bible writers recognize a characteristic of impatience in
                   man, and therefore they stress patience. (See Heb. 10:35-37.)
                   The fact is that it is God who has to be especially patient with us.
                   He is long-suffering, but His purposes will not be long delayed.
                     "We should pray as earnestly for the descent of the Holy Spirit
                   as the disciples prayed on the day of Pentecost. If they needed it
                   at that time, we need it more to-day.... Without the Spirit's aid,
                   our efforts to present divine truth will be in vain."—Ellen G.

                                                                       September 9
             Part 1     What did the seer of Patmos behold sweeping across the
      PROMISES AND    heavens? Rev. 14:6-11.
        PROPHECIES
                        This is a prophecy written in no uncertain words. The prophet
                      saw what was going to happen in the last days. The first angel
                      was proclaiming the message "with a loud voice"—a voice loud
                      enough to make it possible for every nation and kindred and
                      tongue and people to hear him.

                        What other emphatic promise and prophecy did Jesus pro-
                      nounce? Matt. 24:14.

                        In spite of the delay resulting from human lukewarmness and
                      lack of both preparation and consecrated activity, the day will
                      come when in the providence of God the work will be finished
                      and "this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the
                      world" (Matt. 24:14). "God is in the work, and no man can
                      prevent its ultimate success."—Prophets and Kings, p. 645.

                         Read and analyze another prophetic assurance of a
                      finished work in the time of the end. Rev. 10:5-7.

                         The angel swore "that there should be no more delay, but that
                      in the days of the trumpet call to be sounded by the seventh
                      angel [our time], the mystery of God [the plan of redemption], as
                      he announced to his servants the prophets, should be fulfilled"
                      (verses 6, 7, RSV).
                         When God promises something, He has the power and the
                       willingness to fulfill that promise. So many times we have the
                      tendency to get discouraged about the finishing of the
                      evangelistic task, especially in view of the population explosion.
                      But the work is God's, not ours. And we should not engage in
                      calculations lacking faith, but trust His Word, knowing that no
                      promise of God has failed or will fail.
                         "The message loses none of its force in the angel's onward
                      flight, for John sees it increasing in strength and power until the
                      whole earth is lightened with its glory. The course of God's
                      commandment-keeping people is onward, ever onward. The
                      message of truth that we bear must go to nations, tongues, and
                      peoples. Soon it will go with a loud voice, and the earth will be
                      lightened with its glory. Are we preparing for this great outpour-
                      ing of the Spirit of God?"—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 383.

THINK IT THROUGH         "The work will surely go forward, whether we advance with
                      it or not. It will be victorious, but the question is: Shall we be
                      victorious with it?"—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 571.

                                                                   September 10
           Part 2     Read Isaiah 60:1, 2
    A TIME FOR A
  CLEAR MESSAGE        At the precise moment when "darkness shall cover the earth,
                    and gross darkness the people," the command of God was:
                    "Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is
                    risen upon thee."
                       We are living in the darkest hours of history. Modern theology
                    has done away with the main truths of the Bible and has per-
                    verted the gospel of Jesus. Satan is confusing and deceiving the
                    multitudes that are hungry for the bread of life. For this special
                    time God commands His people to preach a clearer and more
                    direct message.

                      What is one of the messages that will be proclaimed before
                    Jesus returns? Rev. 18:1-4.

                        "This scripture points forward to a time when the announce-
                    ment of the fall of Babylon, as made by the second angel of
                    Revelation 14 (verse 8), is to be repeated, with the additional
                    mention of the corruptions which have been entering the vari-
                    ous organizations that constitute Babylon, since that message
                    was first given, in the summer of 1844."—The Great Con-
                    troversy, p. 603.
                        As the Spirit came upon Elijah, moving him to give a strong
                    message of rebuke, so "the message of the third angel will be
                     proclaimed. As the time comes for it to be given with greatest
                     power, the Lord will work through humble instruments.... The
                    sins of Babylon will be laid open. The fearful results of enforcing
                    the observances of the church by civil authority, the inroads of
                     spiritualism, the stealthy but rapid progress of the papal
                     power—all will be unmasked. By these solemn warnings the
                     people will be stirred. Thousands upon thousands will listen
                     who have never heard words like these."—The Great Con-
                    troversy, p. 606.
                        This message will arouse persecution. The people of God will
                     go through a time of temporary consternation and dismay,
                     thinking that their imprudent preaching has produced these
                     consequences. But again the Spirit of God reassures them, and
                     they keep on pressing forward with their prominent message.
                     They persist until the sincere souls are rescued from the sophis-
                     tries of Babylon and the work is finished amid a great manifesta-
                     tion of the power of God.

 THINK IT THROUGH     How can I develop in my life the moral stamina I will need in
                    the time of persecution to proclaim boldly the open message
                    of God?

           Part 3      What assurance do we have of a fast and miraculous work?
      A FAST AND
MIRACULOUS WORK       "For he will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness:
                    because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth"
                    (Rom. 9:28).

                        "I saw that the quick work that God was doing on the earth
                     would soon be cut short in righteousness and that the messen-
                     gers must speed swiftly on their way to search out the scattered
                     flock."—Early Writings, p. 50.
                        "Through most wonderful workings of divine providence,
                     mountains of difficulty will be removed and cast into the sea.
                     The message that means so much to the dwellers upon the earth
                     will be heard and understood. Men will know what is truth.
                     Onward and still onward the work will advance until the whole
                     earth shall have been warned, and then shall the end come."—
                    Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 96.
                       "The light of truth will shine forth in clear, strong rays, and, as
                    in the time of the apostles, many souls will turn from error to
                    truth. The earth will be lighted with the glory of the Lord."—
                    Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 46.
                        What important providences will God work to speed up the
                     proclamation of His truth?
                        "I saw that God has His agents, even among the rulers. And
                    some of them will yet be converted to the truth. They are now
                    acting the part that God would have them. When Satan works
                    through his agents, propositions are made, that, if carried out,
                     would impede the work of God and produce great evil. The good
                    angels move upon these agents of God to oppose such proposi-
                    tions with strong reasons, which Satan's agents cannot resist. A
                    few of God's agents will have power to bear down a great mass
                    of evil. Thus the work will go on until the third message has done
                    its work, and at the loud cry of the third angel, these agents will
                    have an opportunity to receive the truth, and some of them will
                    be converted, and endure with the saints through the time of
                    trouble."—Testimonies, vol. 1, p. 203.
                        "The efforts made to retard the progress of truth will serve to
                    extend it. The excellence of truth is more clearly seen from every
                    successive point from which it may be viewed. Error requires
                    disguise and concealment. It clothes itself in angel robes, and
                    every manifestation of its real character lessens its chance of
                    success."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 454.

                    of the onward march of truth?

           Part 4     Read carefully Revelation 18:1-4.
      THE LATTER

    FINISHING OF    lishment has been carefully planned in advance? For months
     GOD'S WORK     there has been no light, no electric power. The homes and
                    public buildings are being erected, and the electricians are also
                    working hard to set the installations for light and power. When
                    all this work is ready, after many weeks of hard toil, finally one
                    day the signal is given to the power plant. The connection is
                    made, and all of a sudden the whole city is inundated with light,
                    both the streets and the houses.
                       Similarly the hard work of the children of God that is going on
                    right now in the world to sow the seed of truth—by lay members,
                    colporteurs, pastors and evangelists, using the spoken word,
                    radio and television, and especially the printed page—is like the
                    task of the electrical engineers and technicians who are prepar-
                     ing the city for a flood of light.
                       When the latter rain descends from heaven on the children of
                    God, the whole earth will be quickly lighted with the truth by the
                     power of the Holy Spirit.
                       How does the spirit of prophecy present this thought?
                       "The message will be carried not so much by argument as by
                     the deep conviction of the Spirit of God. The arguments have
                     been presented. The seed has been sown, and now it will spring
                     up and bear fruit. The publications distributed by missionary
                     workers have exerted their influence, yet many whose minds
                     were impressed have been prevented from fully comprehend-
                     ing the truth or from yielding obedience. Now the rays of light
                     penetrate everywhere, the truth is seen in its clearness, and the
                     honest children of God sever the bands which have held them.
                     Family connections, church relations, are powerless to stay
                     them now. Truth is more precious than all besides. Not-
                     withstanding the agencies combined against the truth, a large
                     number take their stand upon the Lord's side."—The Great
                     Controversy, p. 612.

                      How does Zechariah refer to the only power that can enable
                    the church to finish her appointed task? Zech. 4:6.

                      With the assurance we have of the latter rain, with the cer-
                    tainty of Christ's constant companionship in our labors, with
                    the wonderful promises spread all over the Bible like the stars in
                    heaven, we should prepare as a people and stand up as one man
                    to do the work in the power of the Spirit of God.

   CONSECRATION
                    For "sanctify" the NASB reads "consecrate."
                    Only a miracle of the grace and power of God will finish the
                 work and allow modern Israel to cross the Jordan into the
                 Promised Land. But for the Lord to perform the miracle in us, we
                 need to consecrate ourselves. First came consecration, then
                 came the miracle.
                    We need to collaborate with God so that He can finish the
                 work He has begun in us—and He is able and willing to do it. We
                 need to reject all unrighteousness and to become partakers of
                 the divine nature. We need to receive, by faith and surrender,
                 the sanctifying righteousness of Christ—His character restored
                 in us.
                   God cannot pour out the Holy Spirit on a worldly and uncon-
                 secrated people. He cannot fill contaminated vessels with His
                 Spirit. A thorough preparation needs to be done. "Sanctify
                 yourselves" is the command of the hour.

                     What did Jesus do so that His disciples may be sanctified?
                   John 17:19.

                       Jesus has set us an example. Just as He dedicated Himself to
                    the work of redemption, so we are to be dedicated to the truth,
                    living it and preaching it.
                       The word "sanctify" comes from two Latin words which mean
                    "to make holy." To sanctify, therefore, has the added connota-
                    tion of moral uprightness, spiritual thinking, and issuing in a life
                   of goodness and godliness. A selfish life is not part of the
                    process of sanctification.
                       Too much time has elapsed. The hour is late. Finally the
                   opportunity has come for us to cross the Jordan. Before we can
                   finish the work in the world, under the power of God, He has to
                   finish it in our own hearts.
                       The consummation of the work of the gospel is primarily a
                   divine work. God has promised it, and He has ample resources
                   to accomplish it. But in order to carry out His marvelous design,
                   the Lord uses human beings as instruments. The three angels of
                   Revelation 14 represent God's people on the march, engaged in
                   the fulfillment of the gospel commission.
                       The first condition that the Most High requires of His people in
                   order to make bare His holy arm is that they consecrate them-
                   selves to God and His work.

                                                                     September 14
           Part 6      What command did Jesus give His disciples?
SECOND NECESSARY
       CONDITION:      "Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every
      WITNESSING     creature" (Mark 16:15).

                       No amount of consecration can replace work, the witnessing
                     activity. No amount of prayer and study of the Bible can be
                     substituted for the actual use of our opportunities to testify for
                     Christ. Yet we are never alone in working. (See Mark 16:20.)

                      In what other words does Jesus express our responsibility?
                     Matt. 20:4.

                        It is interesting to note that Jesus promises wages for what-
                     ever we do for Him. These wages are always fair and sufficient
                     for our needs (v. 13) if not altogether generous.
                        In His wisdom God has established the fact that missionary
                     activity is an indispensable part of our Christian experience. As
                     growing Christian children, we need not only food (the study of
                     the Word) and spiritual oxygen (prayer) but also exercise (work
                     for Christ).
                        "Love to Jesus will be manifested in a desire to work as He
                     worked for the blessing and uplifting of humanity. . . .
                        "The Saviour's life on earth was not a life of ease and devotion
                     to Himself, but He toiled with persistent, earnest, untiring effort
                     for the salvation of lost mankind. . . .
                        "So those who are the partakers of the grace of Christ will be
                     ready to make any sacrifice, that others for whom He died may
                     share the heavenly gift."—Steps to Christ, pp. 77, 78.
                         What are the benefits of working for others?
                         "The effort to bless others will react in blessings upon our-
                     selves. . . .
                         "The Spirit of unselfish labor for others gives depth, stability,
                     and Christlike loveliness to the character, and brings peace and
                      happiness to its possessor. . .
                         "The only way to grow in grace is to be disinterestedly doing
                      the very work which Christ has enjoined upon us."—Steps to
                     Christ, p. 79, 80.       .
                         There can be no symmetrical development of character with-
                      out unselfish work for Christ.
                         What union will be necessary to finish God's work?
                         "The work of God in this earth can never be finished until the
                      men and women comprising our church membership rally to
                      the work, and unite their efforts with those of ministers and
                      church officers."—Gospel Workers, p. 352.

                                                                    September 16
             Part 1   "The apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus,
          TIME WITH and told him all things, both what they had done, and what
               GOD they had taught. And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves
                    apart into a desert place, and rest a while" (Mark 6:30, 31).

                       After the disciples had worked hard for a time, the Saviour
                     invited them to retire to a quiet place with Him. They needed to
                     enjoy not only a little rest but also a season of communion with
                     Him. In the closeness and privacy of the Master with the disci-
                     ples, He could communicate freely with them, correct their
                     mistakes, encourage them, and strengthen them for their future
                     work. As disciples, we too need the refreshing company of Him
                     who is the Source of all power, comfort, and wisdom.
                       Every child of God has a vital need to enjoy the wonderful
                     companionship of Jesus in the precious moments of private
                     communion with Him. Amidst the hurry and worry of life, even in
                     the work of God, every Christian needs enough time dedicated
                     to his private devotions.

                       What was the loving reproach Jesus addressed to the busy
                     and concerned Martha? Luke 10:41, 42.

                        Every one of us needs "that good part, which shall not be
                     taken away" from him, namely, to sit quietly at the feet of Jesus,
                     like Mary, and commune with Him. He is the only fountain of
                     courage, strength, and victory.
                        A few hurried minutes every morning are not enough. A few
                     minutes each day are better than nothing. But in order to feel
                     the presence of God and hear His voice completely, many be-
                     lievers feel they need at least one half to one hour spent in quiet
                     communion with the heavenly Father and the Saviour.
                        This may mean that we need to seta special program in which
                     we deliberately eliminate many nonvital things to make room for
                     our personal devotions, because this is the basis of our spiritual
                     strength and our Christian experience.

THINK IT THROUGH       What ought to be a major theme of our meditations?

                        "It would be well for us to spend a thoughtful hour each day in
                     contemplation of the life of Christ. We should take it point by
                     point, and let the imagination grasp each scene, especially the
                     closing ones. As we thus dwell upon His great sacrifice for us,
                     our confidence in Him will be more constant, our love will be
                     quickened, and we shall be more deeply imbued with His spirit.
                     If we would be saved at last, we must learn the lesson of peni-
                     tence and humiliation at the foot of the cross."—The Desire of

         Part 2  On one occasion, what did Jesus do in order to have time for
 ALONE WITH GOD private meditation?

                      "In the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went
                    out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed"
                    (Mark 1:35).

                      Family worship is a necessity and a sound basis for a happy
                    home. Worship at church or in groups is also a great source of
                    spiritual strength and is indispensable to our Christian growth.
                    But our private devotions alone with God are also a necessity.
                    Each of us has some specific items to discuss with our Father in
                    private.
                      In private devotion we do not need to be worried about time. If
                    we need to confess our faults and sins, express our love to God,
                    unburden our souls of grief and sorrow, pray for victory over
                    definite weaknesses or sins, or intercede before the Lord on
                    behalf of unconverted souls, we can do all these things only
                    without hurry in our direct and personal contact with the throne
                    of grace. God is never tired of hearing us.

                      What happened to Saul after his vision on the Damascus
                    road? Acts 9:9.

                       "For three days Saul was 'without sight, and neither did eat
                    nor drink.' . .
                       "These days of close self-examination and of heart humilia-
                    tion were spent in lonely seclusion. . . .
                       "During the long hours when Saul was shut in with God alone,
                    he recalled many of the passages of Scripture referring to the
                    first advent of Christ. . . .
                       "As Saul yielded himself fully to the convicting power of the
                    Holy Spirit, he saw the mistakes of his life and recognized the
                    far-reaching claims of the law of God."—The Acts of the Apos-
                    tles, pp. 118, 119.

                      Where did Elijah hear "a still small voice" speaking to his
                    heart? 1 Kings 19:12.

                        This is the voice of the Holy Spirit that every child of God
                    , needs to hear. The Spirit can speak to our hearts better when
                     everything is quiet and we are alone with God.

            Part 3     How did Paul describe his Christian experience?
      DAILY DYING
                       "I die daily" (1 Cor. 15:31).

                       Although Paul is referring primarily to his life of constant
                     danger and persecution, these words can also have a spiritual
                     application of a relationship with God. (See Gal. 2:20.)
                       It is our privilege to renew our Christian experience daily.
                     Every day God has provided a fresh supply of His grace. Every
                     day there awaits us a renewal of our personal contact with
                     Heaven. Every day we may die again to sin and to the world.
                     Every day we may rejoice to renounce self and surrender to
                     Christ so that He may take over in the leadership and rulership
                     of our lives.
                       It is not enough to take sufficient time to be alone with God
                     one day. The following day we may have the same joy. As we eat
                     food every day to have physical strength, so also we eat spiritual
                     food every day. Thus we keep a close contact with Jesus.

How to Be Prepared for the Crisis-1             LESSON 12 ❑ Wednesday
                                                          September 19
          PART 4      Of what importance are the words of Jesus?
    STUDY OF THE
       SCRIPTURE      "The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they
                    are life" (John 6:63).

                      The daily study of and meditation on the words of Jesus—and,
                    by extension, the Word of God in general—is of utmost impor-
                    tance. Christ's words are spirit and life, and by feeding on them
                    we receive spiritual life that only they can impart.

                      What, according to Jesus, does a study of the Scriptures
                    reveal? John 5:39.

                      We have eternal life in the Scriptures because they testify of
                    Jesus. From the very first page to the last, the Bible contains a
                    clear presentation of Him.

                      How can we abide in Jesus and have all the benefits that
                    come from that experience? John 15:7.

                      It is evident that the way in which we can abide in Jesus and
                    have Him abide in us is through what He calls "My words."
                    When we are in a prayerful spirit and a teachable mo9c1 with the
                    Bible open before us, we are in contact with our heavenly
                    Father. We hear His voice speaking to us. Through His Holy
                    Spirit the Lord points out our needs to us and also our weak-
                    nesses. He encourages us with His wonderful promises, full of
                    power, through which we are made "partakers of the divine
                    nature." He strengthens our souls and takes us by the hand to
                    make us victorious.
                      Who only will be able to stand through the last great conflict?
                      "None but those who have fortified the mind with the truths of
                    the Bible will stand through the last great conflict."—The Great
                    Controversy, pp. 593, 594.
                      "Only those who have been diligent students of the Scrip-
                    tures and who have received the love of the truth will be
                    shielded from the powerful delusion that takes the world
                    captive."—The Great Controversy, p. 625.
                       "When the testing time shall come, those who have made
                    God's word their rule of life will be revealed. In summer there is
                    no noticeable difference between evergreens and other trees;
                    but when the blasts of winter come, the evergreens remain
                    unchanged, while other trees are stripped of their foliage."—

                    that it will allow me to stand firm in the great crisis we have to
                    face soon?



                                                                                  101
How to Be Prepared for the Crisis-1              LESSON 12          ❑ Thursday
                                                                   September 20
           Part 5      Why did Jesus tell the parable of the widow and the judge?
      PRAYER AND
      COMMUNION       "He spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought
                    always to pray, and not to faint" (Luke 18:1).

                       There can be no genuine Christian life without prayer. In fact,
                    our spiritual experience will be as strong as the intensity and the
                    steadfastness of our prayer life.
                       Jacob spent a night of struggle with God in earnest prayer,
                    humbling his soul. He sought the assurance of forgiveness and
                    the protection and the grace of God, and a miracle was wrought
                    in his life. Even his name was changed. (See Gen. 32:24-28.)
                    Jesus agonized in prayer as a man in Gethsemane. God gave
                    Him the victory and enabled Him to put the golden seal on the
                    plan of salvation by giving His life. In his trip to Mount Moriah
                    Abraham spent the days of his journey and the nights of rest in
                    humble and fervent communion with God when the Lord re-
                    quested the life of his son, and he was able to stand the most
                    terrible ordeal of his life. (See Genesis 22.) Not one of us today,
                    as children of God, can afford to lose the power of "the effectual
                    fervent prayer of a righteous man" that "availeth much" (James
                    5:16).
                       "Prayer is the opening of the heart to God as to a friend. Not
                    that it is necessary in order to make known to God what we are,
                    but in order to enable us to receive Him. Prayer does not bring
                    God down to us, but brings us up to Him."—Steps to Christ,
                    p. 93.

                      What are some of the conditions of an efficient prayer life?

                      (1) To feel our need of God's help (Matt. 5:6). (2) To eliminate
                    any known sin from our life. (Ps. 66:18). (3) To pray with faith
                    (Mark 11:24). (4) To pray with a spirit of love and forgiveness
                    (Matt. 6:12). (5) To pray with perseverance (Rom. 12:12).
                      "There is necessity for diligence in prayer; let nothing hinder
                    you. Make every effort to keep open the communion between
                    Jesus and your own soul. Seek every opportunity to go where
                    prayer is wont to be made. Those who are really seeking for
                    communion with God will be seen in prayer meeting. . . .
                      "We should pray in the family circle, and above all we must
                    not neglect secret prayer, for this is the life of the soul. It is
                    impossible for the soul to flourish while prayer is neglected."—

How to Be Prepared for the Crisis-1              LESSON 12              ❑ Friday
                                                                    September 21
         Part 6    How does the apostle Paul sum up the very essence of a
   CHRIST IN YOU victorious Christian experience?

                     "To whom God would make known what is the riches of
                   glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in
                   you, the hope of glory" (Col. 1:27).

                      The very heart of the mystery of godliness is expressed in a
                   simple, short, and wonderful formula: "Christ in you." The en-
                   trance of Christ into our hearts and His permanent dwelling
                   there is the great secret of a completely wholesome spiritual
                   condition, of a Christlike life. This is the crux of sanctification:
                   Christ and His Holy Spirit abiding in our hearts, the Rulers of our
                   life through an attitude of faith and complete surrender of our
                   will. This results in a blessed identification of our life with Christ
                   and of our will with His will.

                     How did Jesus illustrate the close relationship that should
                   exist between man and Christ, and the blessed results? John
                   15:4-7.

                     The means of grace whereby the soul is brought into such
                   close and vital connection with Christ as to produce the fruits of
                   a totally converted and victorious life are these: faith in Christ
                   and in the Word of God, obedience, surrender of the will to God,
                   study of the Word, and meditation and secret prayer.

                     What is the process that effects the identification of our will
                   with the will of God? Heb. 12:2.

                     "By beholding we are to become changed.... It is by faith in
                   the Son of God that transformation takes place in the character,
                   and the child of wrath becomes the child of God.... In becom-
                   ing a man of obedience to God, he has the mind of Christ, and
                   the will of God becomes his will. . . .
                     "Continual devotion and piety bring the man in such close
                   relation to Christ that he has the mind of Christ. He is one with
                   Christ."—Selected Messages, bk. 1, p. 338.
                     "When we desire to be set free from sin, and in our great need
                   cry out for a power out of and above ourselves, the powers of the
                   soul are imbued with the divine energy of the Holy Spirit, and
                   they obey the dictates of the will in fulfilling the will of God."—

How to Be Prepared for the Crisis-2              LESSON 13            ❑ Sunday
                                                                   September 23
           Part 1   What must the Christian do if he wants to be a true disciple
      SELF-DENIAL of Jesus?

                      "Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come
                    after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and
                    follow me" (Matt. 16:24).

                      The denial of self is the door of entrance to discipleship. Only
                   when self is crucified can Christ occupy the throne of our heart.
                   And self is our worst enemy. So a complete surrender of our will
                   to God and to Christ is a necessity for a healthful spiritual
                   condition.
                      Satan offers fame, power, riches, sensual pleasure, and the
                   intoxication of self-love. By the power of God and the work of
                   the Holy Spirit, we need to deny ourselves all these things and
                   others akin to them. We must crucify all of them along with the
                   old man and plead with Christ to occupy our heart and be our
                   Lord and supreme Ruler.

                     How does the apostle James stress the need of surrender?
                   James 4:7.

                      "Unless we do yield ourselves to the control of Christ, we shall
                   be dominated by the wicked one. We must inevitably be under
                   the control of the one or the other of the two great powers that
                   are contending for the supremacy of the world. It is not neces-
                   sary for us deliberately to choose the service of the kingdom of
                   darkness in order to come under its dominion. We have only to
                   neglect to ally ourselves with the kingdom of light. If we do not
                   co-operate with the heavenly agencies, Satan will take posses-
                   sion of the heart, and will make it his abiding place."—The
                   Desire of Ages, p. 324.
                      "Every soul that refuses to give himself to God is under the
                   control of another power. He is not his own. He may talk of
                   freedom, but he is in the most abject slavery."—The Desire of
                   Ages, p. 466.
                      "When you give up your own will, your own wisdom, and learn
                   of Christ, you will find admittance into the kingdom of God. He
                   requires entire, unreserved surrender. Give up your life for Him
                   to order, mold, and fashion. Take upon your neck His yoke.
                   Submit to be led and taught by Him. Learn that unless you
                   become as a little child, you can never enter the kingdom of
                   heaven."—Selected Messages, bk. 1, p. 110.

        FROM SIN
                    "They brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed:
                  and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy;

                      Read the whole story in Mark 2:1-12.

                       His disease was the result of a life of sin, and his pain and

                    wasted flesh was showing signs of decay."—The Desire of
                    Ages, p. 267.
                       "The burden of despair rolls from the sick man's soul; the
                    peace of forgiveness rests upon his spirit, and shines out upon
                    his countenance. His physical pain is gone, and his whole being
                    is transformed.... The guilty sinner is pardoned!"—The Desire
                    of Ages, p. 268.

                      What is the absolute assurance given us about the cleans-
                    ing power of the blood of Jesus? 1 John 1:8, 9.

                      The cleansing of our soul from every sin through repentance
                    and confession and by faith in the precious blood of Jesus is the
                    very basis for a real preparation for the crisis. Now our Re-
                    deemer is interceding in our behalf in the courts of heaven. Now
                    He is presenting His loving sacrifice for our forgiveness. Now He
                    is anxious to impute to us His righteousness. Some day, very
                    soon, the door to opportunity will be closed; the decree will be
                    issued in heaven, "He that is unjust, let him be unjust still"; and
                    the sun of mercy will set forever. God is waiting for us to ac-
                    knowledge our sins. He will forgive our sins as soon as we claim
                    His promise by faith.
                       Unconfessed and unforsaken sins are incompatible with a
                    real preparation for eternity. And even when we do not have
                    gross sins to confess, we need every day the imputed righteous-
                    ness of Christ. Every day we need the experience of repentance.
                    The nearer we are to God and to Christ, the more we see our
                    defects. Every day we need to reaffirm our faith in Jesus. This
                    will renew our confidence in our salvation and will give us peace
                    of mind and trust in the Lord.

               Part 3      Who is able to give us total victory in the Christian warfare?
      TOTAL VICTORY
                          "Unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to
                        present you faultless before the presence of his glory with
                        exceeding joy, to the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and
                        majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever" (Jude 24).

                           The plan of God for our life is forgiveness accompanied by
                        Christian growth and victory over sin. God's requirements cor-
                        respond to the individual's opportunities. We who have been
                        blessed with great light shall be accounted for a high degree of
                        spiritual maturity. We shall be sealed for eternity with the seal of
                        the living God, which will not be put on the forehead of those
                        who "have one spot or stain upon them. It is left with us to
                        remedy the defects in our characters, to cleanse the soul temple
                        of every defilement."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 214.
                          "We shall fail often in our efforts to copy the divine pattern.
                        We shall often have to bow down to weep at the feet of Jesus,
                        because of our shortcomings and mistakes; but we are not to be
                        discouraged; we are to pray more fervently, believe more fully,
                        and try again with more steadfastness to grow into the likeness
                        of our Lord. As we distrust our own power, we shall trust the
                        power of our Redeemer, and render praise to God."—Selected

                          What relation exists between victory and complete submis-
                        sion?
                          "Let no one say, I cannot remedy my defects of character. If
                        you come to this decision, you will certainly fail of obtaining
                        everlasting life. The impossibility lies in your own will. If you will
                        not, then you can not overcome. The real difficulty arises from
                        the corruption of an unsanctified heart, and an unwillingness to
                        submit to the control of God."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 331.

                          Besides the victory over self, what other victory has God
                        promised us? 1 Cor. 15:54-57.

                          "Christ's true disciples follow Him through sore conflicts,
                        enduring self-denial and experiencing bitter disappointment;
                        but this teaches them the guilt and woe of sin, and they are led to
                        look upon it with abhorrence. Partakers of Christ's sufferings,
                        they are destined to be partakers of His glory."—The Acts of the

How to Be Prepared for the Crisis-2              Lesson 13        ❑ Wednesday
                                                                  September 26
          Part 4      What is the natural fruit of repentance?
      OBEDIENCE
                       "When he [John the Baptist] saw many of the Pharisees and
                    Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, 0 genera-
                    tion of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to
                    come? Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance" (Matt.
                    3:7, 8).

                      The Pharisees had an emotional experience of repentance,
                    but the emotion had not been translated into deeds.

                      What does Isaiah say are two characteristics which must go
                    together if we are to eat the good of the land? Isa. 1:19.

                       Willingness is sometimes present without a corresponding
                    capacity to do. Paul complained about this experience in his
                    own life. (See Rom. 7:22-24.) But he found release and victory
                    through Jesus Christ (v. 25).
                       In the day of judgment God will refuse to recognize many
                    professors of the faith who claim to have taught in His name and
                    even to have cast out demons.
                       While it is true that we shall be saved by faith in Jesus and
                    through His priceless sacrifice, it is also true that the fruits of
                    obedience follow authentic faith. If faith is not capable of pro-
                    ducing a change, it is not saving faith at all. It is dead. (See
                    James 2:14-23.)
                       "Faith and works go together, believing and doing are
                    blended. The Lord requires no less of the soul now, than He
                    required of Adam in Paradise before he fell—perfect obedience,
                    unblemished righteousness. The requirement of God under the
                    covenant of grace is just as broad as the requirement He made
                    in Paradise—harmony with His law, which is holy, and just, and
                    good. The gospel does not weaken the claims of the law; it
                    exalts the law and makes it honorable."—Selected Messages,
                    bk. 1, p. 373.
                       "While good works will not save even one soul, yet it is
                    impossible for even one soul to be saved without good works."
                    —Selected Messages, bk. 1, p. 377.
                        "Let no man present the idea that man has little or nothing to
                    do in the great work of overcoming; for God does nothing for
                     man without his cooperation. Neither say that after you have
                    done all you can on your part, Jesus will help you. Christ has
                     said, 'Without me ye can do nothing' (John 15:5). From first to
                     last man is to be a laborer together with God."—Selected Mes-

How to Be Prepared for the Crisis-2             LESSON 13         ❑ Thursday
                                                                 September 27
           Part 5   In what parable did Jesus teach the importance of eventual
      A WORK OF obedience and a life of faith?
      WITNESSING
                    "A certain man had two sons; and he came to the first, and
                  said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard" (Matt. 21:28). Read
                  to verse 32.

                     Some are hasty in professing obedience, but they become
                   delinquent. Others do not obey at once, and it would seem that
                   they are disobedient; but a change takes place in their attitude,
                   and they do what they know to be right. Jesus pointed out to the
                   Pharisees that their apparent zeal for the law was of no con-
                   sequence if it did not lead to total commitment. By contrast, the
                   publicans had apparently broken the law again and again; but
                   when, like Zacchaeus and Matthew, they repented and followed
                   Jesus, then their lives represented true obedience.
                     The true Christian is not marked by what he professes to do
                   but by what he actually does.

                     Of what should a Christian be a diligent witness? Luke 8:39.

                      The story of the Gadarene demoniac is told in three Gospels,
                   and this indicates its importance. That the people were more
                   concerned about the loss of the swine than the healing of the
                   maniac shows how many people are more concerned about
                   temporal wealth than they are with spiritual healing, and they
                   are often afraid of supernatural power. The healed man wanted
                   to follow Jesus, but he was told to witness to what God had done
                   for him, and in this task he was highly successful. (See Mark
                   5:20.)
                     Jesus wants us in our day to witness to what God has done in
                   and through us. Only in this way can the work be finished and
                   Jesus come soon.
                     "God expects personal service from everyone to whom He
                   has entrusted a knowledge of the truth for this time. Not all can
                   go as missionaries to foreign lands, but all can be home mis-
                   sionaries in their families and neighborhoods."—Testimonies,
                   vol. 9, p. 30.
                     "Had the purpose of God been carried out by His people in
                   giving to the world the message of mercy, Christ would, ere this,
                   have come to the earth, and the saints would have received their
                   welcome into the city of God."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 450.
                   These words were written in 1900.

                   God?

How to Be Prepared for the Crisis-2                LESSON 13              ❑ Friday.
                                                                      September 28
         Part 6   Describe the great reunion of the saved after the conflict is
   A WONDERFUL over.
       REUNION
                  "I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could
                number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people and tongues,
                stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with
                white robes, and palms in their hands; and cried with a loud
                voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the
                throne, and unto the Lamb" (Rev. 7:9, 10).

                      Here we see the final and glorious outcome of the great
                    controversy of the ages. Here the prophecy of Isaiah regarding
                    Christ is fulfilled: "He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall
                    be satisfied" (Isa. 53:11). When the Redeemer looks at the in-
                    numerable multitude of the saved of all time, redeemed by His
                    blood, He will be completely satisfied, since He would have
                    come to rescue just one soul.
                      All the saints of the ages are there. They come from every
                    kindred and people and tongue. It is a universal harvest. It is the
                    most blessed and unique reunion of all the victorious children
                    of God.
                      They are clothed with white robes, which means that they are
                    saved by the perfect righteousness of Christ, made available to
                    anyone by faith. They have palms in their hands, which repre-
                    sent the fact that they have won the victory over Satan and sin by
                    "the blood of the Lamb, and the word of their testimony" (Rev.
                    12:11).

                      How does John the revelator bring his book to a close? Rev.
                    22:20.

                      The revelator replies, "Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus." He
                    seems to say: "Lord, I am ready. The sooner You come, the
                    better!" This is the response that every Christian should be
                    prepared to make.

                      How does Paul sum up his lifework? 2 Tim. 4:7, 8.

                      The more active a person has been for Christ, the more he is
                    ready for Christ's appearing. It is not that he is selfish about the
                    second coming, but he knows that there are many who "love his
                    appearing" and to them the day of reward will be one of great
                    joy. Surely the time must come when sin and sorrow will cease
                    and Christ will usher in His everlasting kingdom of peace.

 THINK IT THROUGH     How can one maintain a balance between being busy for the
                    Lord now, and looking forward to Christ's coming?

                    GUIDE
                    "Napoleon once said; 'Show me a family of
                     readers, and I will show you the people who
                     move the world.'
                     "Some of the happiest and most beneficial
                    times I can recall as a young boy, and now with
                    my own family, were spent together with
                    family members in reading. GUIDE has always
                    been a part of our family. While some church
                    journals are written primarily for adults, and
                    some for children, GUIDE seems to bridge the
                    generations year after year."

                    INSIGHT
                    "I think the articles and editorials in INSIGHT
                    contain important ideas for young people who
                    are faced with making decisions on current,
                    often controversial, issues, and adopting right
                    principles by which to live.
                    "I appreciate INSIGHT's occasional journeys
                    into Adventist history, and reprints of Ellen
                    White's articles from the YOUTH'S INSTRUCTOR.
                    We should be aware of our past and learn all we
                    can from it.
