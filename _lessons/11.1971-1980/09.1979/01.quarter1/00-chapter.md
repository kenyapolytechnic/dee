To the
Sabbath School Members Around the World

Dear Brethren:

It is my privilege to once again address the members of this wonderful inter-
national institution--the Sabbath School.

Although separated by geographical boundaries, national flags, ethnic and
language differences, we are united through the ideals of the Blessed Hope and
the surety of our faith.

This unity of ideals leads us to a plan of mutual action. Consequently, the
church around the world will join together in the carrying out of the following
projects with the Thirteenth Sabbath Special Projects Offering for this quarter:

Hospital in Santa Cruz, Bolivia

The 24,000 Adventists in Bolivia unanimously request the establishment of the
medical-missionary work in their country. Although they are aware of the
challenges they face, they are convinced of the importance of the "right arm of
the message" in the finishing of God's work in their territory.

Belgrano Clinic in Buenos Aires, Argentina

The contribution of the Belgrano Clinic to the Argentine missionary strategy has
been notably outstanding. As the clinic enlarges its installations and modernizes
its equipment, it will enhance the effectiveness of the Adventist program of
penetration in the aristocratic sections of this great capital city. A portion
of the Special Projects Offering for this quarter will assist in the modernization
of the clinic's equipment.

Academy in the South Argentine Conference

For our Argentine brethren, Christian education is more than a simple option; it
is imperative. Thanks to its educational institutions, the work of God in the
Austral Union has cast deep roots, experienced an increase in membership, and
reached admirable denominational strength. Keeping this in mind, the members would
like to add another school to their chain of institutions in the southern part of
the country.

We feel certain that the S        Sch•ol members around the world will contribute
generously, as in the pa                offerings, advancing the projects mentioned.

           THE CHRISTIAN LIFE AND WORK
                                        Introduction

  Down through the centuries God has had a people dedicated to Him. While many in
the world have followed selfish pleasure, eating and drinking, marrying and giving in
marriage without regard to God and His principles of righteousness, others have
recognized that life has no meaning if it is not related to God who created the world,
and activity is empty and futile if it is not imbued with a spirit of love and gratitude.
   The basic concept of these lessons is stewardship and responsibility. We are not
our own, free to do whatever we please. We are not ourselves the source of what we
are and have. All is of grace. We are born into a community where there are duties and
obligations to God and to one another. The center of our thinking is to be for others,
as God's concern has been for us. We live in a world of interrelationships, with ties
that cannot be lightly severed. Thus we need to learn how we can relate to God and
other persons and on what basis we should do so. In this way we can experience a
fullness of life.
   We begin our lessons by noting some characteristics of our heavenly Father. It is
because of what God is and does for man that man finds himself willingly acknow-
ledging his obligationsto Him. It is not a matter of blind obedience, legal and cold, but
a response of love because of God's love for man.
   This response may take many forms, and it is these various forms that we will study
after the first lesson. We will notice first that there will be a consent to pay a tithe of all
increase so that there will always be money in the treasury to do the work of the Lord.
Additional offerings will flow from a heart of love and gratitude.
   Work, which was assigned to man from the beginning, is looked upon as a privilege
and a blessing, especially that work which furthers God's plans and purposes. To
 witness to the truth, to follow in the footsteps of the Master, and to live on earth as
Jesus lived, these are activities that are basic to the person wholly dedicated to God.
   There is always a concern for others, for others are not always as privileged as
some. One must not close one's eyes to the needy all around. There is therefore a
 constant giving, which is the corollary of a constant receiving from the heavenly
Father.
   The ties of the family are especially important. The parents are as God to their
 children, and they have the responsibility of seeing that their children receive a
 Christian heritage. As the children grow older, they need to be trained for the service
 of God and man. The Christian school has a definite role to play that may be costly,
 but that must not be neglected.
   A suitable place for worship is also the responsibility of God's dedicated people to
 provide. Just as God asked for the building of the tabernacle that He might dwell
 among His people in the days of old, so God expects His people to gather together for
 worship today. At the same time God's people preach the gospel to hasten the second
 coming.
    None of these responses is of merit toward salvation. Jesus' righteousness alone
 gains admission to the kingdom for His people. But those whom He has saved will
 cooperate with the Lord in His work for this lost world.

        We have chosen to recognize that          God's true character. Can we reject
     there is a God. Some have dared to           such overtures? The lesson seeks to
     deny His existence, but the Scripture        lay a sound foundation for recognizing

     proof to establish beyond all doubt          God has done for us. We can only

     created the heaven and the earth"            DAILY HIGHLIGHTS
     (Gen. 1:1).                                  1. Creator
        The psalmist wrote that "the                 (Ps. 33:8, 9)
     heavens declare the glory of God" (Ps.       2. Redeemer
     19:1). And Paul was convinced that all          (Isa. 43:1)
     nature points clearly to God's eternal       3. Sustainer
     power and deity. (See Rom. 1:20.)               (Acts 14:17)
     Thus Scripture and nature provide a          4. Protector
     very reasonable basis for belief in a           (Ps. 91:2, 3, 11)
     sovereign God.                               5. Sanctifier
        It is the objective of this lesson to        (1 Thess. 5:23)
     see what God has done. First we note         6. Lord
      that He is the Creator, the Source of all      (Matt. 28:18-20)
      being. He has done all things well, and
      the crowning act of His creation was
      man, created in His image. By this act
      alone God is worthy of allegiance and
      honor. But after man sinned, God
      provided redemption for him. For this
      He paid an inestimable price. This
      debt we can never repay. We can only
      bow in deep gratitude for all that God
      has done. But God does more than pay
      a price; He provides the means of
      sustenance, a power that enables us to
      overcome sin. How can we refuse
      such infinite love and favor? But we
      also need protection from the evil

Our Heavenly Father           LESSON 1                                   ❑ Sunday
                                                                       December 31
             Part 1  What reason does the psalmist give for the command for
           CREATOR people to stand in awe of God?

                       "Let all the earth fear the Lord: let all the inhabitants of the
                     world stand in awe of him. For he spake, and it was done; he
                     commanded, and It stood fast" (Ps. 33:8, 9).

                       According to the Scriptures, everything we see around us in
                     nature, including man, has come into being by God's plan and
                     power. Mere chance cannot account for life on earth.
                       Ellen White states: "The theories and speculations of
                     philosophy would make us believe that man has come by slow
                     degrees, not merely from a savage state, but from the very
                     lowest form of the brute creation. They destroy man's dignity
                     because they will not admit God's miraculous power."—Ellen
                     G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 906.
                       The Scripture does not teach that the world we live in has
                     evolved from a chance conjunction of necessary elements and
                     appropriate circumstances over a long period of time; it tells us
                     that we owe our existence to a God who spoke the word and it
                     was done, He gave commands and His commands were obeyed.

                       What was the quality of God's Creation? Gen. 1:31.

                       Everything that God makes is good because God is good. For
                     this we must be eternally grateful.
                       Theoretically, it could be possible for the world to be in the
                     hands of an inferior god or a tyrant. Some have thought so and
                     based their religion on it. If this were the case, we would have no
                     option but to serve such a god out of fear; and to try to defend
                     ourselves against his tyranny as best we could. How grateful we
                     can be that this is not the situation in which we find ourselves!

THINK IT THROUGH      What are some of the evidences to you that God is a good
                     God and has done all things well?

                        "The real evidence of a living God is not merely in theory; it is
                     in the conviction that God has written in our hearts, illuminated
                     and explained by His word. It is in the living power in His created
                     works, seen by the eye which the Holy Spirit has enlightened."
                     —Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 325.
                        "The Creator of all things, He is the original proprietor. We are
                     His stewards. All that we have is a trust from Him, to be used
                     according to His direction."—Education, p. 137.

           Part 2   "Thus saith the Lord that created thee, 0 Jacob, and he that
        REDEEMER formed thee, 0 Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I
                  have called thee by thy name; thou art mine" (Isa. 43:1).
                      That God is the Creator calls for reverence and awe from man.
                    That God is good makes our response to Him a pleasure. But
                    God has done more than create man; He has also redeemed
                    him.
                      What has God done with our iniquity? Isa. 53:6.
                      When man sinned, he sold himself in slavery to Satan. As a
                    sinner under condemnation of death, there was no hope for him
                    except as God had made provision for his salvation.
                      "In all the universe there was but one who could, in behalf of
                    man, satisfy its [the broken law's] claims. Since the divine law is
                    as sacred as God Himself, only one equal with God could make
                    atonement for its transgression. None but Christ could redeem
                    fallen man from the curse of the law and bring him again into
                    harmony with Heaven. Christ would take upon Himself the guilt
                    and shame of sin—sin so offensive to a holy God that it must
                    separate the Father and His Son. Christ would reach to the
                    depths of misery to rescue the ruined race."—Patriarchs and
                    Prophets, p. 63.
                      What reason does Paul give for our bodies being temples of
                    the Holy Ghost? 1 Cor. 6:19, 20.
                      "The price paid for our redemption should give us exalted
                    views of what we may become through Christ."—Testimonies,
                    vol. 4, p. 563. John tells us that through God's marvelous love we
                    become sons of God. (See 1 John 3:1.)
                      "Through the infinite sacrifice of Christ, and faith in His name,
                    the sons of Adam become the sons of God. By assuming human
                    nature, Christ elevates humanity. Fallen men are granted
                    another trial and are placed where, through connection with
                    Christ, they may educate, improve, and elevate themselves, that
                    they may indeed become worthy of the name 'sons of God.' "—
                    Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 563.
 THINK IT THROUGH      In view of the fact that God has done so much for man
                     through Jesus Christ, is it reasonable for man to do as he
                     pleases? What do you think are some of his obligations?
                        "Whether we recognize it or not, we are stewards, supplied
                     from God with talents and facilities, and placed in the world to
                     do a work appointed by Him."—Education, p. 137.
                        "To the infinite love of the Redeemer every human being is
                     indebted for the gifts of life. . . . And by the obligation of
                     gratitude and service thus imposed, Christ has bound us to our
                     fellow men."—Education, p. 139.

Our Heavenly Father            LESSON 1                                  ❑   Tuesday
                                                                            January 2
             Part 3      What Is the ultimate source of our food?
         SUSTAINER
                         "Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he
                      did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons,
                      filling our hearts with food and gladness" (Acts 14:17).

                        The extent to which man is indebted to God is not always
                      realized. Most will acknowledge the sovereignty of God. Many
                      will admit that He is Creator and Redeemer. But do we recog-
                      nize the constant sustaining power of our heavenly Father in
                      daily life?

                        What did Jesus teach about the heavenly Father's sustain-
                      ing care? Matt. 6:26-30.

                          "He who has given you life knows your need of food to sustain
                      it. He who created the body is not unmindful of your need of
                      raiment. Will not He who has bestowed the greater gift bestow
                      also what is needed to make it complete?
                         "Jesus pointed His hearers to the birds as they warbled their
                      carols of praise, unencumbered with thoughts of care, for 'they
                      sow not, neither do they reap;' and yet the great Father provides
                      for their needs. And He asks, 'Are not ye of much more value
                      than they?' R.V."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 95.

                       Paul prayed for God to sustain the Ephesian believers In
                      what way? Eph. 3:14-16.

                        The same heavenly Father who supplies food for our tables
                      and strength for our work sustains the "inner man." The power
                      to change our sinful selves is not within us by birth. God
                      supplies the power to conquer sin and to live a godly life. It
                      comes by the Spirit who is Christ's gift to those who believe on
                      Him. We have nothing in ourselves to boast of or to trust in. Man
                      has only to surrender his heart to God, to yield his will to Him,
                      and God supplies the power. (See Heb. 12:2.) Jesus is the "au-
                      thor and finisher of our faith."

THINK IT THROUGH       When God says that He will care for us, why are so many
                      worried and afraid? Am I as trusting as I ought to be?

                        "A living faith means an increase of vigor, a confiding trust, by
                      which, through the grace of Christ, the soul becomes a con-
                      quering power."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 62.
                        "In all your work remember that you are bound up with Christ,
                      a part of the great plan of redemption. The love of Christ, in a
                      healing, life-giving current, is to flow through your life."—The

Our Heavenly Father       LESSON 1                              ❑ Wednesday
                                                                   January 3
          Part 4     What promises of protection does God give?
     PROTECTOR
                     "I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress: my
                   God; in him will I trust. Surely he shall deliver thee from the
                   snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence."
                     "For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee
                   in all thy ways" (Ps. 91:2, 3, 11).

                     Read the entire psalm.

                      The Christian is often in physical danger. Satan would like to
                   bring disease and calamity, just as he did to Job. But God is in
                   control. No harm can come to any follower of Christ except as
                   God, in His providence, shall permit.
                      "The righteous understand God's government, and will
                   triumph with holy gladness in the everlasting protection and
                   salvation that Christ through His merits has secured for them.
                   Let all remember this, and forget not that the wicked, who do
                   not receive Christ as their personal Saviour, understand not His
                   providence. The way of righteousness they have not chosen,
                   and they know not God. Notwithstanding all the benefits He has
                   so graciously bestowed upon them, they have abused His mercy
                   by neglecting to acknowledge His goodness and mercy in show-
                   ing them these favors. At any moment God can withdraw from
                   the impenitent the tokens of His wonderful mercy and love."—
                   Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 3,
                   p. 1150.

                     What insight is given in Job 1:8-12 on why Christians some-
                   times suffer calamities?

                     Suffering is one of the consequences of evil. When we experi-
                   ence it or watch others pass through agonies, we respond by
                   hating the sin that has caused all our woes. Suffering may come
                   because of our own delinquencies, and in that case it is usually
                   understandable. But calamities may come to test our faith or to
                   reveal God's glory, or to reveal the full consequences of evil in
                   the world. See Job's response (Job 13:15), and the experience
                   of the man born blind (John 9:3).

THINK IT THROUGH     Can you think of a personal experience when God protected
                   you from imminent danger? Prepare to tell the experience to
                   the class.

                     "God never leads His children otherwise than they would
                   choose to be led, if they could see the end from the beginning
                   and discern the glory of the purpose which they are fulfilling as
                   co-workers with Him."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 479.

Our Heavenly Father           LESSON 1                                  ❑ Thursday
                                                                         January 4
            Part 5   What activity of God does Paul pray that the Thessalonian
         SANCTIFIER believers will experience?

                       "And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray
                     God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blame-
                     less unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ" (1 Thess. 5:23).

                       "Our sanctification is the work of the Father, the Son, and the
                     Holy Spirit. It is the fulfillment of the covenant God has made
                     with those who bind themselves up with Him, to stand with Him,
                     His Son, and His Spirit in holy fellowship. Have you been born
                     again? Have you become a new being in Christ Jesus? Then
                     cooperate with the three great powers of heaven who are work-
                     ing in your behalf."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible
                     Commentary, vol. 7, p. 908.

                      What does Paul say the Roman believers were called to be?
                     Rom. 1:7.

                       The words "sanctify" in First Thessalonians 5:23 and "saints"
                     in Romans 1:7 are two forms of the same Greek word. To
                     sanctify is to make holy. A saint is a holy one.

                       What truth about man's response to God's call may be
                     learned from the parable of the great supper? Luke 14:16-24.

                        God's call is an invitation which may be rejected. Unfortu-
                     nately there are many who prefer to go their own way rather than
                     to fit in with God's plans. But those who reject God's call will
                     suffer the consequences. (See Matt. 22:13.) But man is abso-
                     lutely free to make his own decision.
                        The one who accepts God's invitation is accepting life at its
                     best. The hardships that the Christian sometimes has to suffer
                     are not to be compared with the satisfactions that come from a
                     life wholly dedicated to God. Man has joy when he is able to do
                     good for his neighbors. By contrast, there is a misery and sense
                     of guilt that comes to one who has failed to rise up to expecta-
                     tions, or who has deliberately chosen a life of sin.

THINK IT THROUGH       What are some of the joys of the Christian life of service?
                     How do you think the Christian ought to express his gratitude
                     to God?
                        "The spirit of unselfish labor for others gives depth, stability,
                     and Christlike loveliness to the character, and brings peace and
                     happiness to its possessor. The aspirations are elevated. There
                     is no room for sloth or selfishness. Those who thus exercise the
                     Christian graces will grow and will become strong to work for
                     God."—Steps to Christ, p. 80.

Our Heavenly Father        LESSON 1                                    ❑ Friday
                                                                       January 5
          Part 6     What is the basis of the gospel commission?
          LORD
                     "Jesus came and said to them, All authority in heaven and
                   on earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make disci-
                   ples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father
                   and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe
                   all that.I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, to
                   the close of the age' " (Matt. 28:18-20, RSV).

                      The commission is given in the words of Jesus, but the author-
                   ity for His words came from His heavenly Father. The Bible term
                   to give the meaning of "one who has authority" is the word
                   "Lord." A commission can be given only by someone who has
                   the authority (power, KJV) to do so. Jesus claimed that all
                   authority had been given to Him. What was this authority? Jesus
                   described it as authority to give eternal life to as many as were
                   given to Him. (See John 17:2.) Paul described this authority as
                   exceeding great, "far above all principality, and power, and
                   might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in
                   this world, but also in that which is to come" (Eph. 1:21).
                      Furthermore, Jesus promised that He would be with His dis-
                   ciples "even unto the end of the world" (Matt. 28:20, KJV). Thus
                   the commission to witness is not only a command, it is a pro-
                   mise that Jesus will make the execution of the commission
                   dynamic and effective.

                    How do we know that when Jesus sends anyone to preach
                   He also gives the necessary authority? Matt. 10:1.

                      When Jesus outlined to His disciples what they should do on
                   their missionary journey, He said: "Freely ye have received,
                   freely give." From this we gather that the privilege to witness
                   and to exercise authority over evil of all kinds was due to their
                   acceptance of the gospel. As we have had the gospel given to us
                   freely, so we should be willing to give it to others freely so that
                   they may enjoy the full benefits of eternal life also.
                      What would you think of someone who knew the cure for
                   cancer and kept it to himself? Would he not be responsible for
                   deaths by cancer when the cure was there to be passed on?
                      No one will go to heaven alone. He will be accompanied by all
                   those who learned the way from him.

THINK IT THROUGH     Why are some people afraid to witness? What is the basic
                   qualification for effective witnessing?

                     "Christ's work below is His work above, and our reward for

          OF FAITH teous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet
                    speaketh" (Heb. 11:4).

                         Many who read the story of Cain and Abel in Genesis 4 wonder
                     whether God was altogether fair in accepting Abel's offering
                     and rejecting Cain's. Was not Cain doing a good thing, they ask,
                     in bringing the results of his labor in the field? Was not God a
                     little partial, and Cain somewhat justified in his anger?

                       What is the basic difference between the sacrifices of the
                     two brothers? Heb. 11:4.

                        "Cain and Abel, the sons of Adam, differed widely in charac-
                      ter. Abel had a spirit of loyalty to God; he saw justice and mercy
                      in the Creator's dealing with the fallen race, and gratefully
                     accepted the hope of redemption. But Cain cherished feelings
                     of rebellion, and murmured against God because of the curse
                     pronounced upon the earth and upon the human race for
                     Adam's sin. He permitted his mind to run in the same channel
                     that led to Satan's fall—indulging in the desire for self-
                     exaltation and questioning the divine justice and authority."—
                     Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 71.
                        Obviously Abel had faith and trust in God. This was shown in
                     the sacrifice and made it acceptable. Cain was out of harmony
                     with God, and his sacrifice was offered as a favor done to God,
                     and therefore could not be accepted.
                        It is a mistake to think that we can worship God as we please.
                     There is a right way and a wrong way of worshiping. Worship
                     without a recognition of the need of a Redeemer is presump-
                     tion. Furthermore, worship in a way other than that prescribed
                     by God is rebellion.
                        An adequate response to God means doing what God wants
                     us to do, recognizing that He is the One who took the initiative.
                     He is the One who knows best. Obedience to God arises out of a
                     loving trust. Without such a relationship worship becomes an
                     empty form, a meaningless ritual.

THINK IT THROUGH       What is a basic characteristic of most false religions? Can
                     even a true faith be improperly practiced? How?

                        "The class of worshipers who follow the example of Cain
                     includes by far the greater portion of the world; for nearly every
                     false religion has been based on the same principle—that man
                     can depend upon his own efforts for salvation."—Patriarchs

Man's Response to God          LESSON 2                              ❑ Monday
                                                                      January 8
          Part 2     What did Melchizedek say to Abram about his victory?
      THE BASIC
         TENTH       "Blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine
                   enemies into thy hand" (Gen. 14:20, first part).

                     Abram was a man of peace rather than of war, but when he
                   heard how Lot had been taken captive in the invasion of the
                   valley of Sodom and Gomorrah, he decided to rescue him. He
                   counseled with God first and then set out after the invading
                   kings who had escaped with great booty. Catching up with
                   them, he inflicted a surprise attack and gained a speedy victory.
                      "To Abraham, under God, the triumph was due. The wor-
                   shiper of Jehovah had not only rendered a great service to the
                   country, but had proved himself a man of valor. It was seen that
                   righteousness is not cowardice, and that Abraham's religion
                   made him courageous in maintaining the right and defending
                   the oppressed."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 135.

                    After Melchizedek's blessing, how did Abram respond?
                   Gen. 14:20, last part.

                      By paying tithes of all the spoils, Abraham was letting all the
                   people know that he recognized God's ownership and God's
                   blessing. He refused to accept any personal gain in a campaign
                   which he had undertaken for God without any thought of profit.
                   What a powerful testimony this must have been to all who knew
                   Abraham! Abraham was not only a symbol of unselfishness, but
                   also an example of a worshiper of the true God who returned a
                   tenth to his Maker.
                      "When Abraham rescued the captives from the Elamites, the
                   attention of the people was called to the true faith. Abraham was
                   not a stranger to the people of Sodom, and his worship of the
                   unseen God had been a matter of ridicule among them; but his
                   victory over greatly superior forces, and his magnanimous dis-
                   position of the prisoners and spoil, excited wonder and admira-
                   tion. While his skill and valor were extolled, none could avoid
                   the conviction that a divine power had made him conqueror.
                   And his noble and unselfish spirit, so foreign to the self-seeking
                   inhabitants of Sodom, was another evidence of the superiority
                   of the religion which he had honored by his courage and
                   fidelity."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 157.

                                                                          January 9
            Part 3   "If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that Igo,
         A MUTUAL and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, so that I
        AGREEMENT come again to my father's house In peace; then shall the lord
                   be my God: and this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be
                   God's house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give
                   the tenth unto thee" (Gen. 28:20-22).

                         To get the full meaning of this vow we must note the cir-
                      cumstances. Jacob had secured the blessing of the birthright
                      from his father by a ruse, and had angered his brother Esau.
                      Now he was fleeing for his life. "He felt that he was an outcast,
                      and he knew that all this trouble had been brought upon him by
                      his own wrong course. ... With weeping and deep humiliation
                      he confessed his sin."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 183.

                       How did God assure Jacob that He had not forsaken him?
                      Gen. 28:15.

                        Jacob responded to God's promise by agreeing that he would
                      pay a tithe of all that God gave to him. "Jacob was not here seek-
                      ing to make terms with God. The Lord had already promised him
                      prosperity, and this vow was the outflow of a heart filled with
                      gratitude for the assurance of God's love and mercy. Jacob felt
                      that God had claims upon him which he must acknowledge, and
                      that the special tokens of divine favor granted him demanded a
                      return."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 187.
                         In view of the goodness and generosity of God, what ques-
                      tion asked by the psalmist ought we to ask also? Ps. 116:12.

                        "The Christian should often review his past life and recall with
                     gratitude the precious deliverances that God has wrought for
                     him, supporting him in trial, opening ways before him when all
                     seemed dark and forbidding, refreshing him when ready to
                     faint. . . .
                          . . . We should acknowledge God's goodness, not only by
                     expressing our gratitude in words, but, like Jacob, by gifts and
                     offerings to His cause."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 187, 188.

THINK IT THROUGH       In your reading of the Bible who is the one who initiates
                     agreements, God or man? Give examples.

                        "Shall we who enjoy the full light and privileges of the gospel
                     be content to give less to God than was given by those who lived
                     in the former, less favored dispensation? Nay, as the blessings
                     we enjoy are greater, are not our obligations correspondingly
                     increased? . . . From the cross of Calvary, Christ calls for an
                     unreserved consecration. All that we have, all that we are,
                     should be devoted to God."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 188.

Man's Response to God            LESSON 2                         ❑ Wednesday
                                                                    January 10
           Part 4     In Joseph's answer to Potiphar's wife, what do we learn
    THE REFUSAL     about the nature of sin?
          TO SIN
                      "There is none greater In this house than I; neither hath he
                    kept back anything from me but thee, because thou art his
                    wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against
                    God?" (Gen. 39:9).

                       Sin is not merely transgression of the law with consequences
                    to ourselves; sinning is an affront to God! When God is so good
                    to us, how can we possibly continue in sin? How can we even
                    consider performing one act of sin?
                       Joseph in Egypt lived in the midst of idolatry. He was sur-
                    rounded by temptation on every side. Yet he determined to be
                    faithful to his God. And the Lord blessed him. (See Gen. 39:2, 5.)
                    He never concealed the fact that he was a worshiper of Jehovah.
                    Thus everyone knew that his success and prosperity were due
                    to the favor of God. Living as he did in the sight of God, he found
                    it unthinkable to consent to a wrong act. To sin would be to let
                    God down!

                      Against whom did David say that he sinned? Ps. 51:4; 2 Sam.
                    12:13.
                      Some people think that because their sins are hidden from
                    their fellowmen they are not so serious as open sin. They try to
                    hide their sins, hoping thereby to maintain a certain amount of
                    dignity. It is a mockery to God to suppose that sins can be hid-
                    den from His all-seeing eye.
                      "If we were to cherish an habitual impression that God sees
                    and hears all that we do and say and keeps a faithful record of
                    our words and actions, and that we must meet it all, we would
                    fear to sin. Let the young ever remember that wherever they are,
                    and whatever they do, they are in the presence of God. No part
                    of our conduct escapes observation."—Patriarchs and Proph-
                    ets, p. 217.
                      The key to Joseph's integrity was his recognition that he owed
                    everything to God. He therefore chose to do nothing that would
                    hurt that relationship or show ingratitude.

THINK IT THROUGH      What is it that keeps you from sinning? Why is sinning an
                    injustice to God?

                      "He [God] desires us to have the mastery over ourselves, our
                    own will and ways. But He cannot work in us without our con-

           Part 5     "I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have
       THE FIGHT    kept the faith" (2 Tim. 4:7).
        OF FAITH
                       Paul encouraged Timothy to "fight the good fight of faith"
                    (1 Tim. 6:12). He said he had done so himself and thus had set
                    the proper example. He looked upon life as a struggle. The
                    Christian is to be like a soldier wearing full armor (Eph. 6:13), or
                    like an athlete running a race (1 Cor. 9:24).

                     What was the motivating force behind Paul's dedication to
                    God and the ministry? 2 Cor. 5:14.

                       "The love of Christ controls us, because we are convinced
                    that one has died for all; therefore all have died. And he died for
                    all, that those who live might live no longer for themselves but
                    for him who for their sake died and was raised" (2 Cor. 5:14, 15,
                    RSV).
                       Many factors have motivated men. Some have been ambi-
                    tious and wanted honor for themselves. Others have been
                    driven to some kind of action by fear. Paul makes it clear that he
                    was motivated by love, a love for God that was so strong that
                    nothing could separate him from God. (See Rom. 8:38, 39.)

                      What was Paul's attitude to his call to minister? Eph 3.8.

                      Paul also called himself the "least of the apostles" (1 Cor.
                    15:9). He also referred to himself as the chief of sinners. (See
                    1 Tim. 1:15.) It is obvious that Paul considered himself greatly
                    favored. It is no wonder, then, that he gave his life in complete
                    dedication to God. He allowed nothing to hinder him from
                    giving his whole life to the gospel ministry. He was a man of
                    unusual talent and attainment. At one time he had prided him-
                    self on his heritage and achievement. But when he met Christ on
                    the way to Damascus, his whole life pattern was changed. What
                    he formerly considered important he now considered to be of
                    no consequence. (See Phil. 3:7, 8.) He had only one object of
                    glory, and that was Christ. (See Gal. 6:14.) Few people have
                    experienced the difficulties he passed through. (See 2 Cor.
                    11:23-28.) But he kept pressing on.

THINK IT THROUGH      Why do you think it is appropriate to refer to life as a battle or
                    a race? What was the aspect of God's love that so gripped
                    Paul that He yielded his life in service to Him? Did God do more
                    for Paul than He has done for you and me?

Man's Response to God           LESSON 2                                 ❑ Friday
                                                                        January 12
         Part 6   "Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold,
      FAITHFUL the devil shall cast some of you in prison, that ye may be tried;
    UNTO DEATH and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto
                death, and I will give thee a crown of life" (Rev. 2:10).

                      Life is very precious, and instinctively we hold on to it. It takes
                   more than ordinary courage and dedication to be willing to give
                   it up for the sake of a person or a principle.
                      Not everyone is called upon to die for his faith, but everyone
                   must be prepared to do so if necessary. Note the apostle
                   James's execution (Acts 12:1, 2); the three who refused to bow
                   down to Nebuchadnezzar's image (Dan. 3:16-18). Daniel was
                   put into the lion's den for praying to his God, but the lions were
                   not permitted to molest him. Some experiences of the people of
                   God in the Old Testament as they faced opposition are de-
                   scribed in Hebrews 11:33-38.

                     What was it that made Jesus willing to give up His life for us
                   sinners? Rom. 5:7, 8; John 15:13, 14.

                     The love of Christ for the human family was so great that He
                   did not withhold anything. When we consider all that He has
                   done for our salvation, can we legitimately hold back anything
                   from Him? (See Heb. 12:3, 4.)

                    What warning and promise did Jesus give to His disciples?
                   Mark 13:13.

                     The first death is not the greatest tragedy that can happen to
                   one. After death comes the resurrection; so that death can be
                   looked upon as a sleep and a rest. The Christian may die for the
                   Master now, but he will live with Him throughout eternity. That is
                   why martyrs have faced death with composure. Christians are
                   not so much concerned with what happens to them in this life,
                   but are eager to have a part in the life to come.

THINK IT THROUGH     What is the difference between being willing to suffer and
                   die for the Master and having a persecution complex? Do you
                   think that Christians should pray for tribulation?

                      Jesus taught His disciples not to expose themselves un-
                   necessarily to persecution. "He Himself often left one field of
                   labor for another, in order to escape from those who were
                   seeking His life. . . .
                      " . . . Those who are true to God need not fear the power of
                   men nor the enmity of Satan. In Christ their eternal life is secure.
                   Their only fear should be lest they surrender the truth, and thus
                   betray the trust with which God has honored them."—The De-

                                                                      January 14
         Part 1   "He who did not grudge his own Son but gave him up for us
       SUPREME all—can we not trust such a God to give us, with him, every-
          LOVE thing else that we can need?" (Rom. 8:32, Phillips).

                     All heaven was given with the gift of God's Son for the fallen
                   race. But that was not the end of God's giving. He still gives.
                   Paul asserts that if God was willing to give His Son He is willing
                   to give everything that a man needs.

                     What promises did Jesus give that assured His disciples
                   that they need not lack anything? John 14:14; 16:24.

                      "The Saviour's promise to His disciples is a promise to His
                   church to the end of time. God did not design that His wonderful
                   plan to redeem men should achieve only insignificant results.
                   All who will go to work, trusting not in what they themselves can
                   do, but in what God can do for and through them, will certainly
                   realize the fulfillment of His promise."—The Desire of Ages,
                   p. 667.

                     What did Jesus say was the basic motive in His lifework?
                   Luke 19:10. What is ours? (See John 20:21.)

                      "Our mission to the world is not to serve or please ourselves;
                   we are to glorify God by co-operating with Him to save sinners.
                   We are to ask blessings from God that we may communicate to
                   others. The capacity for receiving is preserved only by impart-
                   ing. We cannot continue to receive heavenly treasure without
                   communicating to those around us."—Christ's Object Lessons,
                   pp. 142, 143.
                      God provides us with the necessary qualities so that we can
                   be successful in our pleading. Note the following statement: "It
                   was Christ Himself who put into that mother's [the Syrophen-
                   ician woman's] heart the persistence which would not be re-
                   pulsed. It was Christ who gave the pleading widow courage and
                   determination before the judge. It was Christ who, centuries be-
                   fore, in the mysterious conflict by the Jabbok, had inspired
                   Jacob with the same persevering faith. And the confidence
                   which He Himself had implanted, He did not fail to reward."—

                   every Christian's need, why are so many weak and helpless in
                   their testimony to the world?

                     "Many do not have a sense of the sinfulness of their own

                                                                       January 15
          Part 2    What did Jesus say is the one supreme goal of the Chris-
   SEEKING GOD'S tian?
       KINGDOM
                    "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness;
                 and all these things shall be added unto you" (Matt. 6:33).

                      Philosophers have suggested many goals for life. Some have
                    suggested pleasure; others, virtue; still others, the greatest
                    good for the greatest number. Some philosophers today
                    suggest that a person should "do his own thing," throwing off
                    the trammels of his culture and tradition, refusing to be bound
                    by the rules and regulations of family, trying everything, and
                    arriving at his own conclusions regardless of society's approval
                    or disapproval.
                      The Christian longs above all else to see the kingdom of God
                    established. There is a danger that he may be diverted to other
                    aspects of life—for example, to earning a good living, acquiring
                    property, building up a bank account, or having as many
                    gadgets as his neighbor. These are aspects of life that the
                    Christian sees all around him. Jesus assured His disciples that if
                    they set their mind on the higher goal of seeking the kingdom of
                    God by their life and witness, they would have all the necessities
                    of life provided.

                      What assurance about life's needs does the psalmist give to
                    the believer? Ps. 34:10; 37:3-5.

                       All those who have trusted God have never found Him to fail
                    them. In fact it is one of the pleasurable experiences in life to
                    see how God answers prayer and provides all our needs in ways
                    that are most unexpected. What is needed is a basic commit-
                    ment to God, a decision to do only what God wants us to do. God
                    takes the committed life and uses it to His glory, so that His
                    purposes are accomplished.
                       Seeking God's kingdom requires a dedication of the whole
                    life including a dedicated purse. Not all can preach or'engage in
                    paid activity by the church; but all can give so that the work of
                    God is advanced.

THINK IT THROUGH      What are my life goals?

                       The child of God may not be rich in this world's goods. In fact,
                    in the eyes of the world he may be very poor. But the richness of
                    his faith means that he is content, and in many cases he lives a
                    happier and fuller life than the man who lives in a palace.

          Part 3   What reason did Jesus give for His warning against cov-
      THE DESIRE etousness?
        TO HAVE
         THINGS    "Then he said to them, 'Watch, and be on your guard against
                 avarice of any kind, for a man's life is not made secure by what
                 he owns, even when he has more than he needs' " (Luke
                 12:15, Jerusalem).

                     The tenth commandment forbids covetousness of any kind,
                   yet the sin of covetousness is "one of the most common and the
                   most lightly regarded."-Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 496.

                     Note two biblical examples of those who coveted. Achan,
                   Joshua 7; Ananias and Sapphire, Acts 5. What can we learn
                   from these experiences?

                      Covetousness is insidious and therefore all the more danger-
                   ous. Very often those who have it are not aware of it. It grows
                   upon them imperceptibly, and unless it is rooted out it will bring
                   about destruction, as in the examples above or in the experi-
                   ence of Judas.
                     It is easy to trust in a bank balance. It is very easy to feel that
                   we ought not to give so much away as we do. The rich young
                   ruler went away sorrowfully because he could not bring himself
                   to change his source of security. (See Matt. 19:16-26.)

                     Read Luke 12:15-21. What lessons about possessions are
                   taught in this parable?

                      "Constant, self-denying benevolence is God's remedy for the
                   cankering sins of selfishness and covetousness. God has ar-
                   ranged systematic benevolence [later called tithes and offer-
                   ings] to sustain His cause and relieve the necessities of the
                   suffering and needy. He has ordained that giving should be-
                   come a habit, that it may counteract the dangerous and deceit-
                   ful sin of covetousness. Continual giving starves covetousness
                   to death."—Testimonies, vol. 3, p. 548.
                     Riches are from the Lord and belong to Him. The rich must
                   not be tied to their riches. But let not the poor be covetous!

THINK IT THROUGH     Can you see some advantages in being poor? Do we give to
                   the church because the Lord needs our money or because we
                   need to give It?

                      "The oft-repeated and striking warnings of our Redeemer are
                   in marked contrast with the actions of His professed followers
                   who evidence in their lives so great eagerness to be rich and
                   who show that the words of Christ are lost upon them."—

                                                                    January 17

           Part 4    What was one of the purposes to be served by Christ's
    THE EXAMPLE     washing the disciples' feet?
       OF JESUS
                      "I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have
                    done to you" (John 13:15).
                       God requires nothing of us that is out of harmony with what
                    He Himself does. In everything that He has done He has gone to
                    a limit beyond what man could ever reach alone. Whatever God
                    asks us to do is reasonable, possible, and for our good.
                       In the Decalogue we have been given a standard of godly
                    living. But people often become legalistic in living by the law.
                    They become more concerned with the letter than the spirit,
                    with regulations rather than principles. When a life is lived in
                    accordance with the law, the spirit of the law is plainer. Jesus
                    proved that the law could be kept, and He showed how it should
                    be kept.

                      What invitation did Jesus extend to His disciples? Matt.
                    4:19; 16:24.
                      "For three years and a half the disciples were under the
                    instruction of the greatest Teacher the world has ever known.
                    By personal contact and association, Christ trained them for His
                    service. Day by day they walked and talked with Him, hearing His
                    words of cheer to the weary and heavy-laden, and seeing the
                    manifestation of His power in behalf of the sick and the afflicted.
                    Sometimes He taught them, sitting among them on the moun-
                    tainside; sometimes beside the sea or walking by the way, He
                    revealed the mysteries of the kingdom of God. . . . He did not
                    command the disciples to do this or that, but said, 'Follow
                    Me.' "—The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 17, 18.

                      What sentence sums up Christ's way of life? Acts 10:38.
                      To do as Jesus did, this is the most beautiful life. It does not
                    require great talent, advanced degrees, high attainments. It
                    means that we accept the way of Jesus as the best way for us,
                    and that in everything we do we follow the pattern that is set.

 THINK IT THROUGH      How can I follow in the footsteps of the Master?
                       "You are not to look to yourself, not to let the mind dwell upon
                    self, but look to Christ. Let the mind dwell upon His love, upon
                    the beauty, the perfection, of His character. Christ in His self-
                    denial, Christ in His humiliation, Christ in His purity and holi-
                    ness, Christ in His matchless love—this is the subject for the
                    soul's contemplation. It is by loving Him, copying Him, depend-
                    ing wholly upon Him, that you are to be transformed into His
                    likeness."—Steps to Christ, pp. 70, 71.

Motives       LESSON 3                                                   ❑ Thursday
                                                                           January 18
            Part 5    "A poor widow came and put in two small coins, the equiva-
          SACRIFICE lent of a penny" (Mark 12:42, Jerusalem).

                       We often appreciate gifts according to their cost or their
                     worth. Thus a gift of one thousand dollars is better appreciated
                     than a gift of one dollar. But in the story of the widow's mite
                     Jesus pointed out another aspect of giving.

                       What made the gift of the widow to the treasury more valu-
                     able in the sight of God than the much larger sums put In by
                     others? Mark 12:43, 44.

                        One wonders what the treasurers did with the two mites when
                     they emptied the box! Did they put the coins into petty cash, not
                     even troubling themselves to count them among the offerings?
                     What could they do with two mites anyway? Did the widow
                     realize that her deed would go down in history as an example of
                     giving to all succeeding generations? The story points up the
                     truth that God is aware of everything that is going on; that He is
                     more concerned with motive than with value.
                        "The act of the widow who cast two mites—all that she had—
                     into the treasury, is placed on record for the encouragement of
                     those who, struggling with poverty, still desire by their gifts to
                     aid the cause of God.... The value of the gift is estimated not by
                     the amount, but by the proportion that is given and the motive
                     that actuates the giver."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 342.
                        Even we are sometimes more concerned with motives than
                     with amounts. What mother does not thrill when her child
                     brings some buttercups or other wild flowers to her in the
                     kitchen? It is the deed of love, not the value of the flowers, that
                     strikes to the heart. On the other hand, the gift that is presented
                     with a fanfare may be accepted as an honor and highly valued,
                     but lacking the heartfelt simplicity of the child's gift. The giver of
                     such gifts gets his reward in notice but that is all he gets.

                       What assurance do we have that the Christian is always in a
                     position to make an offering when needed? 2 Cor. 9:8.

                       "A continual imparting of God's gifts wherever the cause of
                     God or the needs of humanity demand our aid, does not tend to
                     poverty."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 345.

THINK IT THROUGH       How much would I give were Ito give the equivalent, for me,
                     of the widow's two mites?
                        "Spiritual prosperity is closely bound up with Christian liber-
                     ality. The followers of Christ should rejoice in the privilege of
                     revealing in their lives the beneficence of their Redeemer"—

Motives   LESSON 3                                                     ❑ Friday
                                                                      January 19
          Part 6     There is obvious need for law; without the law there is no
       LEGALISM    knowledge of sin. The law is holy, just, and good. (See Rom.
                   7:12.) The trouble comes when we try to gain salvation by law
                   keeping, when we look at the letter and forget the spirit.

                     What did Jesus say some of the Jews neglected in their
                   concern for the letter of the law?

                     "Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye
                   pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the
                   weightier matters of the law, Judgment, mercy, and faith:
                   these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other
                   undone" (Matt. 23:23).

                      Jesus did not say that mint, dill, and cummin should not be
                   tithed, but He did say that justice, mercy, and faith are important
                   aspects of commandment keeping. When the law is kept in an
                   attempt to rid ourselves of guilt, then that is legalism. Pure
                   legalism is cold, harsh, unsympathetic, arrogant, and
                   domineering—characteristics that are far from the nature of
                   God Himself. Jesus kept the whole law. Yet He was humble, un-
                   derstanding, kind, merciful, and considerate.

                     According to Jesus' instructions to the Twelve for their mis-
                   sionary Journey, what Is the spirit that should motivate the
                   Christian in his relationship to his fellowmen? Matt. 10:8.

                     When a person receives mercies and blessings, the least that
                   he can do is to respond with a life of concern for others and their
                   needs. The Good Samaritan manifested true neighborly con-
                   duct, and his actions typify what Jesus came to do. Do we as
                   Christians manifest the same spirit? Note the following state-
                   ment: "Although the customs of the world are no criterion for
                   us, yet I have been shown that the pitying sympathy and the
                   benevolence of the world for the unfortunate in many cases
                   shame the professed followers of Christ."—Testimonies, vol. 3,
                   p. 524. A Christian's love should always exceed the world's!

THINK IT THROUGH     What leads one (as Matthew 18:23-35) who has had favors
                   shown to him be inconsiderate of others?

                     "Selfishness and cold formality have well-nigh extinguished
                   the fire of love, and dispelled the graces that should make
                   fragrant the character. Many who profess His name have lost
                   sight of the fact that Christians are to represent Christ. Unless
                   there is practical self-sacrifice for the good of others, in the
                   family circle, in the neighborhood, in the church, and wherever
                   we may be, then whatever our profession, we are not
                   Christians."—The Desire of Ages, p. 504.

                                                                         January 21
             Part 1 "On the seventh day God ended his work which he had
          GOD, THE made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work
     MASTER WORKER which he had made" (Gen. 2:2).

                       The Bible makes it clear that when God was creating, He was
                     working. He "divided" light from darkness, waters from waters
                     (Gen. 1:4-6). He "set" sun, moon, and stars in the heavens (verse
                     17). He "formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed
                     into his nostrils the breath of life" (Gen. 2:7). He "planted" a
                     garden in Eden, and "took" and "put" man in it (verses 8, 15).
                     Here is activity in human terms that indicates a plan, a purpose,
                     and the execution of plan and purpose. This is work. Then God
                     "ended" His work, and "rested" and "blessed" (verses 2, 3).
                     Here is order and benevolence—work at its best.

                       How did the psalmist feel about God's work? Ps. 104:24.

                       Jesus pointed out God's concern for His creation. (See Matt.
                     6:26.) The psalmist speaks of God's care for His people. (See Ps.
                     33:13-19.) God's care is very personal. (See Isa. 41:10.) The
                     whole of creation is sustained by Him. (See Heb. 1:3.) God's
                     work is to provide for the whole of His creation, but at the same
                     time it reflects His perfection and beauty of character.

                       What important work has God done that affects every
                     human being? How should we react in consequence? Isa.
                     44:22, 23.

                        We ought to spend more time considering what God has done
                     for us. Do we recognize how dependent we are on God for every-
                     thing? It is not because of our own strength and skill that we are
                     able to earn a living and enjoy many comforts. It is God who has
                     given us the health and strength, without which we could do
                     nothing. It is God who protects us from danger and has enabled
                     us to keep what we have. Because God is not seen, He is often
                     forgotten. Only when we fully recognize all that God has done
                     and continues to do for us, can we be truly grateful and express
                     our appreciation.

THINK IT THROUGH       Looking at God as the Master Worker, what would you say
                     are the basic characteristics of work?

                        "God would have His children appreciate His works and de-
                     light in the simple, quiet beauty with which He has adorned our
                     earthly home. He is a lover of the beautiful, and above all that is
                     outwardly attractive He loves beauty of character; He would
                     have us cultivate purity and simplicity, the quiet graces of the
                     flowers."—Steps to Christ, p. 85.

The Privilege of Work         LESSON 4                               ❑ Monday
                                                                     January 22
           Part 2     What was the work given to Adam and Eve in the garden?
  MAN, HIS WORK
 RESPONSIBILITIES     "God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and
                    multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have
                    dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air,
                    and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
                      "And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the
                    garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it" (Gen. 1:28; 2:15).

                       In the Genesis story man was given definite assignments of
                    work. This is understandable, because man was created in the
                    image of God. Therefore, even as God Himself has responsibil-
                    ities toward His creation, so man was to exercise dominion over
                    the territory that was placed under his charge.
                       "Adam was not to be idle. Our Creator, who understands what
                    is for man's happiness, appointed Adam his work. The true joy
                    of life is found only by the working men and women. The angels
                    are diligent workers; they are the ministers of God to the chil-
                    dren of men. The Creator has prepared no place for the stagnat-
                    ing practice of indolence."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 50.

                     What changes took place in man's work as a result of sin?
                    Gen. 3:17-19.

                      "When man became Satan's captive, the dominion which he
                    held, passed to his conqueror."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
                    p. 67.
                      The ground was cursed and would bring forth thorns and
                    thistles. Man's work would be doubly hard, involving toil and
                    pain. Yet nature is still dependent on man. Unless man works
                    with the soil, plants deteriorate into an unprofitable state.

                     What assurances has God given of reliability in nature?
                    Gen. 8:22.

                      Man cannot claim that the world owes him a living and do
                    nothing. Work is basically a recognition that man has the
                    responsibility for his own needs.

 THINK IT THROUGH     What attitude should the Christian take to his work? What
                    can he do to make life more worthwhile for himself and for
                    others?

                       "From their earliest years children should be led to feel that
                    they are part of the home firm. Even the little ones should be
                    trained to share in the daily work and should be made to feel that
                    their help is needed and is appreciated. The older ones should
                    be their parents' assistants, entering into their plans and shar-
                    ing their responsibilities and burdens."—Education, p. 285.

The Privilege of Work           LESSON 4                                  ❑ Tuesday
                                                                          January 23
             Part 3    "Jesus Increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with
         JESUS, THE God and man" (Luke 2:52).
            MODEL
          WORKMAN     The ideal development is that development that is Godward
                    and manward. Jesus was the kind of person who received the
                    approbation of God in His life and was appreciated by all right
                    thinking people for His service to man. These are marks of true
                    greatness.

                       What trade did Jesus learn and use as a young man In
                      Nazareth? Mark 6:3.

                         "The life of Christ from His earliest years was a life of earnest
                      activity. He lived not to please Himself. He was the Son of the
                      infinite God, yet He worked at the carpenter's trade with His
                      father Joseph. His trade was significant. He had come into the
                      world as the character builder, and as such all His work was
                      perfect. Into all His secular labor He brought the same perfec-
                      tion as into the characters He was transforming by His divine
                      power. He is our pattern."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 345.
                         The years that Jesus spent in Nazareth have been called "the
                      hidden years." From the time He returned from Jerusalem at the
                      age of 12, to the time He came to be baptized of John around the
                      age of 30, He lived a quiet life, being subject to His parents, and
                      doubtless supporting His mother after the death of Joseph. All
                      we are told is that He "grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled
                      with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him" (Luke 2:40).
                      One thing is certain; Jesus was a hard worker, and in His work
                      He manifested the spirit and character of His heavenly Father.

                        What did Jesus say about His work? John 9:4; Matt. 20:28.

                        There was an urgency in the attitude of Jesus to His work.
                     Time was moving along, and there were things that had to be
                     done in the immediate present. We cannot postpone to the
                     future what needs to be done today. Because of who He was and
                     what He was, Jesus applied Himself to the tasks that were His to
                     perform. He was true to His Father and faithful to the people
                     whom He had come to serve.

THINK IT THROUGH       What work of Jesus was more important, His work as a
                     carpenter, or His work of preaching and healing?

                       "He was doing God's service just as much when laboring at
                     the carpenter's bench as when working miracles for the
                     multitude."—The Desire of Ages, p. 74.

The Privilege of Work        LESSON 4                            ❑ Wednesday
                                                                   January 24
          Part 4   How does Paul say the Christian ought to relate himself to
   RELATIONSHIPS his master or employer?
       AT WORK
                   "Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters ac-
                 cording to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of
                 your heart, as unto Christ; not with eyeservice, as menpleas-
                 ers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the
                 heart" (Eph. 6:5, 6).

                      Although slavery as an institution is not practiced in the world
                    today as it was in the days of Paul, nevertheless, many are
                    caught in the clutches of an economic system that may be as
                    harsh and demanding as slavery. Slavery may be gone, but the
                    problem of relationships, about which Ephesians 6:5, 6 speaks,
                    still remains for most of us.
                      The Christian is honest, faithful, respectful, diligent,
                    wholehearted in his service for his employer. Not because his
                    employer is worthy of all these characteristics—in many in-
                    stances, his employer may not be worthy of any of them—but
                    because that is the way he should work as a Christian employee.
                    All the time he is working he is really serving his Lord Jesus
                    Christ. His work is a testimony of his relationship with his God.
                    The employee may not be able to preach a sermon or give a
                    Bible study, but his faithful service speaks louder than words
                    and in many instances is even more effective.

                      What counsel does Paul give to employers in the matter of
                    relationships? Eph. 6:9.

                      Employers, no less than employees, should show that their
                    relationship to God is right. They are not to lord it over their
                    employees, nor are they to treat some better than others. James
                    warns against those who take financial advantage of their
                    employees. (See James 5:4.) God holds everyone responsible
                    for the way he uses his authority and position of rank, and He
                    will not let the one who misuses his power go unpunished.
                      Whether a person is an employee or an employer, or acts in
                    both capacities, he is one to whom God has entrusted talents
                    and opportunities. It is for him to use them faithfully, being
                    ready to give an account to his Lord for all that he has done.

 THINK IT THROUGH     When there are abuses in work relationships between
                     employer and employee, what should the Christian do?

                       God never condones evil, but He is the one to judge, and He is
                     the best one to take appropriate action. We must be careful not
                     to try to do God's work for Him!

The Privilege of Work           LESSON 4                                 ❑ Thursday
                                                                          January 25
             Part 5     To what has God called us?
         WORK AND
          VOCATION      "Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not
                      according to our works, but according to his own purpose and
                      grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world
                      began" (2 Tim. 1:9).

                         Most of us have to take part in secular activity in order to earn
                      a living. But we also have a spiritual calling. In all our work,
                      whatever it may be, we must glorify God, showing that all we do
                      is done for Him.
                         It is God who gives the skills necessary to perform the various
                      types of service. God instructs the farmer. (See Isa. 28:25, 26.)
                      God called special persons for particular manual skills and
                      granted them a measure of His spirit for constructing the taber-
                      nacle. (See Ex. 31:2-6.) One of our responsibilities is to discover
                      what talent God has given us and then to use it in His service.

                        What did Paul urge Timothy to make use of? 2 Tim. 1:6.

                         Some people are governed by personal ambition in their
                      selection of what they would do in life. The result is often tragic.
                      "Many a man whose talents are adapted for some other calling,
                      is ambitious to enter a profession; and he who might have been
                      successful as a farmer, an artisan, or a nurse, fills inadequately
                      the position of a minister, a lawyer, or a physician."—Education,
                      p. 267.
                         "We need to follow more closely God's plan of life. To do our
                      best in the work that lies nearest, to commit our ways to God,
                      and to watch for the indications of His providence—these are
                      rules that ensure safe guidance in the choice of an occupation."
                      —Education, p. 267.
                        It is interesting to note that in the New Testament men were
                      called to be saints, or apostles, or fishers of men. This suggests
                      that there is a higher calling that applies to everyone regardless
                      of his mode of earning a living. The matter of first importance is
                      not what type of work we do every day for a living, but that we act
                      as children of God and accomplish God's purposes.

THINK IT THROUGH       How can the Christian be guided in choosing that type of
                      work that is best suited to him?

                         "Christ in His life on earth made no plans for Himself. He
                      accepted God's plans for Him, and day by day the Father un-

           Part 6 •     "We are labourers together with God" (1 Cor. 3:9).
          WORK,
      A BLESSING        Those who work as God intends they should are described as
                      God's fellow workers, workers together with God. They live in
                      harmony with the laws of the universe, and will live forever.

                        What advice does the wise man have for the person who
                      does not like to work? Prov. 6:6-11.
                        The sluggard is the person who exercises no self-discipline.
                      He acts according to the impulse of the moment. He soon finds
                      that by indulging in the pleasures of the moment he misses out
                      on the real satisfactions of life.

                        What drastic rule did Paul lay down when he was with the
                      Thessalonians? 2 Thess. 3:10.

                        "The Lord does not require the hardworking man to support
                      others in idleness. With many there is a waste of time, a lack of
                      effort, which brings to poverty and want. If these faults are not
                      corrected by those who indulge them, all that might be done in
                      their behalf would be like putting treasure into a bag with holes.
                      Yet there is an unavoidable poverty, and we are to manifest
                      tenderness and compassion toward those who are unfortunate.
                      We should treat others just as we ourselves, in like cir-
                      cumstances would wish to be treated."—Christ's Object Les-
                      sons, pp. 247, 248.

                        What exhortation did Paul give to the Thessalonians?
                      1 Thess. 4:11.

                         Hard work means that we help ourselves and we gain the
                      respect of the community. But work is not enjoined as an end in
                      itself; it is a means to an end, and that end is the service of God.
                      It is not to be limited to labor for life's necessities, but to include
                      labor "for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life" (John
                      6:27). There are some types of activity that the Christian can
                      never engage in because they involve the breaking of the law.
                      (See Eph. 4:28.) But the work of the Lord is that kind of labor that
                      will always bring joy and satisfaction.

 THINK IT THROUGH       Why does work often have therapeutic value?

                        "Inactivity is the greatest curse that could come upon most
                      invalids. Light employment in useful labor, while it does not tax
                      mind or body, has a happy influence upon both. It strengthens
                      the muscles, improves the circulation, and gives the invalid the
                      satisfaction of knowing that he is not wholly useless in this busy
                      World."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 240.

          THE CALL of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them
         TO WATCH warning from me" (Eze. 3:17).
         AND WARN
                      Jesus told His disciples that they were to watch because they
                    did not know when their Lord would come. (See Matt. 14:42.) A
                    watching servant is one who is not caught unawares but is busy
                    doing his duty, in spite of distractions of the surroundings.

                       What Is Jesus' description of the watchful servant? Matt.
                     24:45-47.

                       Another dimension of watching is added in the experience of
                     Ezekiel—he is to watch and to warn. He is to be concerned, not
                     only with his own welfare, but with the welfare of others.
                       The figure of speech used by Ezekiel is that of a man stationed
                     on the wall of a city commissioned to keep his eyes open for the
                     enemy that might be creeping up stealthily with the purpose of
                     taking the city unawares. Most of the inhabitants are asleep.
                     They are dependent on the watchman to stay awake and per-
                     form his duty. As soon as he sees danger, he blows the trumpet
                     of warning, and the people arouse to resist the enemy.
                       Ezekiel says that we are as responsible for giving the warning
                     to others as we are for knowing it ourselves.

                       What solemn responsibility Is placed on the watchman?
                     Eze. 33:7-9.

                        Since God has given us a truth that involves the whole world,
                     we cannot, with impunity keep this truth to ourselves. It does not
                     follow that when we tell someone of the truth that he will accept
                     it and be saved. But when we have passed on to him the mes-
                     sage we have received from God, then he alone is responsible
                     for his reaction to the message. On the other hand, if we have
                     had a chance to witness and have not seized the opportunity,
                     the loss of a soul that results is placed at our charge. This
                     emphasizes how important it is for us to share our faith.

THINK IT THROUGH       Instead of coming like a thief in the night and requiring that
                     His disciples watch, why does not our Lord tell us the time
                     when He will come?

                       If the early church had been told that two thousand years
                     would pass before the second advent, they would have been
                     discouraged. At the same time, for every one of us the moment
                     of death is the end of probation, and the next significant event is
                     the coming of Jesus. Since death can come at any time, it is
                     necessary to watch at all times and seize every opportunity to
                     witness to the truths of the gospel.

      TO WITNESS Jerusalem, and in Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the utter-
                 most part of the earth" (Acts 1:8).

                      From the experience of the centurion at Calvary, what can
                    we learn about the basic qualifications for a witness? Luke
                    23:47, 48.

                      One must first of all see with his own eyes, feel with his own
                    body and mind, and experience in his heart and life, before he
                    can really give an effective testimony. That which is grasped
                    only by the mind, or is learned at second hand, cannot be vitally
                    communicated to another. That is why it is so important to have
                    a living experience of the truth.

                      From the last words of Jesus to His disciples, what do we
                    learn is essential to witnessing besides the firsthand experi-
                    ence of knowing? Acts 1:8.

                       It is the Holy Spirit that gives power and effectiveness to the
                    witness, for it is the Spirit of God that works on the heart of the
                    listener, to convict and to convince. (See John 16:7-11.) The
                    Holy Spirit also indites the words that are spoken so that they
                    are the right words for the occasion. (See Matt. 10:19, 20.)
                       In an investigation to learn the truth about an event, witnesses
                    are essential. Their word provides evidence as well as confirms
                    other evidence. Without witnesses the truth is hidden, and a lie
                    cannot be discovered. The same principle of testifying to the
                    truth applies to God and His universe.
                       God finds His special witnesses in men and women who have
                    heard His call and testified to what God has been able to do in
                    and through them. On one occasion the Jews wanted Jesus to
                    silence the people when they were crying Hosanna to Him. He
                    said that if the people did not bear their testimony the stones
                    would cry out. (See Luke 19:39, 40.) In other words, the truth of
                    what God has done and is doing for man cannot be kept quiet.
                    The heavens declare the glory of God; every flower and tree
                     speaks of the love of God; but it is man who has the duty and
                     responsibility, being the highest order in the earthly sphere, to
                     raise his voice in testimony to the God who has done so much
                     for him.

 THINK IT THROUGH     Why do some people find it difficult to witness to their faith?

                      It does not require education or advanced learning to tell
                    what one has seen and heard. It only requires a heart of love and
                    a tongue, and most people are blessed with this. How do we use
                    our tongues? Is it to bless or to curse?

           THE CALL Jesus Christ" (2 Tim. 2:3).
         TO ENDURE
                       In this second letter to Timothy, Paul refers to three types of
                     occupations: the soldier, the athlete, and the farmer. (See
                     verses 3-7.) All of them have to discipline themselves in order to
                     accomplish their tasks.

                         What characteristics of the Christian does Paul draw from
                       the experience of the soldier, the athlete, and the farmer?
                       2 Tim. 2:3-7.

                         "In the army, no soldier gets himself mixed up in civilian life,"
                      the Jerusalem Bible translates verse 4. So the Christian must
                      not get mixed up with the world.
                         The athlete knows that he must keep all the rules of the
                      contest if he is to win a crown. Likewise, the Christian knows
                      that he must order his life according to the principles of living
                      laid down in the Bible.
                        The farmer works hard at preparing the soil and sowing the
                      seed and keeping away anything that would prevent his crop
                      from coming to full fruition. So also must the Christian be
                      faithful in applying himself wholly to his task so that he can eat
                      of the fruit of his endeavors.

                        What kind of man does James picture as being blessed or
                      happy? James 1:12.

                        What type of person did Jesus say would be saved? Matt.
                      10:22.

                        It is comparatively easy to begin the Christian life, or even to
                      begin anything. It takes stamina to continue in the Christian
                      pathway in spite of difficulties and hardships. To grit one's
                      teeth, to determine by God's grace not to give up when the
                      going is hard, this is what is necessary at times, although the
                      Christian life has many moments of joy and happiness.

THINK IT THROUGH        How would you show that the average Christian does not
                      begin to go through the hardships that Jesus had to endure?
                      Heb. 12:3, 4.

                        "Men are wanted in this work who will not murmur or com-

                                                                    January 31
           Part 4   "If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and
     THE CALL TO take up his cross, and follow me" (Matt. 16:24).
        TAKE UP
      THE CROSS     Jesus knew what was ahead of Him. He told His disciples
                  details which they did not understand, but which they would see
                  fulfilled in every respect. (See Luke 18:31-34.)

                      What did Jesus say every disciple would have to take up if
                    he were to be a true follower? Matt. 16:24.

                       The disciples knew very well what a cross was. They had seen
                    many in their travels north and south. The Romans used these
                    instruments of execution to make examples of Jews who had
                    fallen afoul of Roman law or authority. It was a symbol of the
                    power of the oppressor, of the bitterness of subjugation. The
                    language of Jesus must have come as a shock to men and
                    women who were hoping that the Messiah would free them from
                    the yoke of the Gentile. But the language is unmistakable. The
                    words of Jesus are recorded in all three synoptic Gospels.
                       One of the cruel aspects of a crucifixion was that the victim
                    had to carry his own cross. Can you imagine how reluctantly a
                    person would take it up? Yet Jesus says that the Christian is to
                    "take up his cross." How is this to be understood? It means he is
                    to deny himself, to die to self.
                       Let us look at the cross of Jesus and see what happened
                    there. Note the following aspects: (1) Jesus was being unjustly
                    treated by other people; (2) the other people should have known
                    better; (3) the treatment was public and shameful.
                       It would seem, then, that taking up a cross means being
                    willing to submit to unjust and shameful treatment at the hands
                     of people who ought to know better.
                       Human nature revolts against the idea of submission to unjust
                     treatment. But that was exactly the experience of Jesus, who
                     said that the servant is not above his Lord and he must not be
                     surprised if he is treated as his Lord was. (See John 15:20.)

                      Can you think of examples of Christians who accepted ig-
                    nominy and torture in the spirit of Christ? (See Acts 16:22-25.)

                      "The apostles [Paul and Silas] suffered extreme torture be-
                    cause of the painful position in which they were left, but they did
                    not murmur. Instead, in the utter darkness and desolation of the
                    dungeon, they encouraged each other by words of prayer and
                    sang praises to God because they were found worthy to suffer
                    shame for His sake."—The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 213, 214.

 THINK IT THROUGH     Are there times when the Christian should stand up for his
                    rights? Who is the one who can do this best for him?

The Call to Service          LESSON 5                                    ❑ Thursday
                                                                          February 1
              Part 5    "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow
           THE CALL    me" (John 10:27).
         TO FOLLOW
                          A few people are called to lead, but most of us follow. Even
                       leaders need to follow a pattern or an ideal. In relation to Jesus,
                       Christian followers and leaders alike are followers. The Chris-
                       tian hears the voice of Jesus and follows Him.

                         What example in the Old Testament do we have of someone
                       who learned a true way and decided to follow it to the end?
                       Ruth 1:16, 17.

                          The story of Ruth tells of one who had learned about the true
                       God and decided she could not go back to her people and their
                       gods. God blessed her richly. She was an ancestress of Christ
                       even though she was not an Israelite. No one who follows the
                       true God loses as a consequence of this choice.

                         What contrast is given in Jude 16-21 between what many
                       people in the world follow and what the Christian follows?
                       What is the result to each?

                         There are only two roads to take; one leads to eternal life and
                       the other leads to death. One results in being a blessing to one's
                       self and to others; the other results in being a problem to one's
                       self and to others. Why do so many take the wrong one?

                         What conditions did Jesus give for those who would follow
                       ("come after") Him? Matt. 16:24.

                         Jesus lived a life of self-denying service and taught others to
                       do the same. Following Jesus means going about doing good
                       even as He did. (See Acts 10:38.) We need eyes to see where we
                       can do good to another and a willing spirit to do it. The kind
                       word spoken, the unpretentious help given glorifies the One
                       whom we follow.

THINK IT THROUGH          Why is it that many do not offer their services to help those
                       in need? Is the average Christian too busy caring for his own
                       interests? How would you try to bring about a change?

                          "Many have excused themselves from rendering their gifts to
                       the service of Christ because others were possessed of superior
                       endowments and advantages. The opinion has prevailed that
                       only those who are especially talented are required to conse-
                       crate their abilities to the service of God. . . . But it is not so
                       represented in the parable. When the master of the house called
                       his servants, he gave to every man his work."—Steps to Christ,

                                                                          February 2
           Part 6     "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in
     THE CALL TO    heaven Is perfect" (Matt. 5:48).
      BE PERFECT
                      This text has caused many heartaches! How can anyone be
                    perfect, let alone be perfect as our heavenly Father is perfect? In
                    Christ the Christian may be perfect. (See Selected Messages,
                    bk. 2, p. 32.)
                      The Greek word translated "perfect" in Matthew 5:48 also has
                    the meaning "mature." It is used in this sense in Hebrews 10:14.
                    The context in Matthew 5 is the impartial love of the heavenly
                    Father (verse 45) for human beings. Jesus calls on us to be
                    mature by loving people impartially as the Father does.

                      What standard of living is set for the child of God in Leviticus
                    19:2?

                      God Himself is the standard that is set for the Christian;
                    whatever He is, the Christian is expected to be. Since God is
                    holy, the Christian must be holy in all the phases of his life. Just
                    as God is perfect in His attitude to all, so the Christian is called to
                    have a right relationship to everyone.

                      What does Jeremiah 31:31-34 say about how man can attain
                    the standards God has set?

                      When God commands, He also gives the power to obey. To do
                    otherwise would be unreasonable. The good news of the gospel
                    is that through Jesus our failure to reach the standard is for-
                    given. The shortfall of our best efforts is made up by Christ's
                    merit. We are given power so that in Christ the Christian can do
                    all things. (See Phil. 4:13.)

                     How important is holiness and the sanctified life for the
                    Christian? Heb. 12:14.

                      "Holiness will lead its possessor to be fruitful and abound in
                    all good works. He will never become weary in well-doing,
                    neither will he look for promotion in this world.... Holiness of
                    heart will produce right actions. It is the absence of spirituality,
                    of holiness, which leads to unrighteous acts, to envy, hatred,
                    jealousy, evil surmisings, and every hateful and abominable
                    sin."—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 445.

 THINK IT THROUGH     Does God set different standards for different people, or
                    does He set one standard for all to attain? What do you think
                    that standard Is?

           Part 1   What practice in regard to parents did Jesus condemn?
        NEEDS OF
     PARENTS AND    "Ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is
       RELATIVES Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be
                  profited by me; he shall be free. And ye suffer him no more to
                  do ought for his father or his mother; making the word of God
                  of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered:
                  and many such like things do ye" (Mark 7:11-13).

                       The fifth commandment states: "Honor thy father and thy
                    mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord
                    thy God giveth thee" (Ex. 20:12).
                       This commandment obviously means more than giving nom-
                    inal respect to father and mother; it means caring for them
                    materially according to their need. Jesus made this clear when
                    He objected to the tradition whereby a son could dedicate his
                    possessions for religious purposes, and thus escape his obliga-
                    tions to support his needy parents.
                       It is only proper that children should care for the needs of
                    parents in their old age as necessary. Even during the agony of
                    the cross Jesus remembered His mother. (See John 19:25-27.)
                       It is the privilege of the Christian family to be tied by bonds of
                    love and affection. It is sin that causes members of the family to
                    harm one another, as in the case of Cain. (See Gen. 4:8, 9.)
                    Families may be broken up because of the truth. (See Matt.
                    10:21, 22.) But the ideal is that unbroken families can enter the
                    kingdom of heaven. Furthermore, the truth can enlarge the
                    boundary of family connections. Note in Mark 10:29, 30 the
                    promise that is made to the disciple who has had to give up
                    physical family ties because of opposition to the truth.

                      What answer is implied by the question in 1 John 3:17?

                       Love is a gift from God, and the heart that is imbued with love
                    cannot remain unconcerned when there is a crying need. John
                    goes on to say (verse 18) that love is not true love that expresses
                    itself only in words; love finds its true expression in acts of
                    kindness and deep concern. (See 1 John 3:18.)

                      What was Paul's view of one who did not support his family?
                    1 Tim. 5:8.

THINK IT THROUGH       Does one's obligation to the family depend on whether the
                    members of the family are in the church or not? Is It proper
                    sometimes to cut off the financial resources of a member of
                    the family because he refuses to comply with church regula-
                    tions?

                   to sacred music, offers prayers, and hears the word of God
                   presented in a sermon. All this has its place in religious life, but
                   the point that James makes means that attendance at religious
                   services without active, loving service in everyday life for others
                   in need is not "pure religion."

                     What elements of religion does Micah point to as constitut-
                   ing the most important features of worship? Micah 6:6-8.

                     Death snatches away the breadwinner and parent with drastic
                   consequences to the rest of the family. Shall people be left to
                   suffer alone in their bereavement? The Bible says, No! Members
                   of the church, in loving sympathy, are to relieve the burdens as
                   far as possible. Orphans need to be cared for, and women who
                   have no means of support are to have their wants supplied.

                     What rules for the Ephesus church regarding church sup-
                   port of needy widows does Paul give In 1 Timothy 5:9-16?

                      Paul recognizes that not all widows are helpless in their situa-
                   tion. Mere widowhood is not a claim on church finances. But
                   where there is need and piety on the part of the widow, then the
                   church members have a responsibility to do what they can to
                   relieve hardship. After citing James 1:27, Ellen White says: "I
                   saw that this is not merely to sympathize with them by comfort-
                   ing words in their affliction, but to aid them, if needy, with our
                   substance."—Testimonies, vol. 1, p. 190.

THINK IT THROUGH     How can the church meet its obligations by caring for the
                   needy without being hindered from accomplishing its task of
                   preaching the gospel?

                     "With every gift and offering there should be a suitable object
                   before the giver, not to uphold any in idleness, not to be seen of
                   men or to get a great name, but to glorify God by advancing His
                   cause. Some make large donations to the cause of God while
                   their brother who is poor, may be suffering close by them, and
                   they do nothing to relieve him. Little acts of kindness performed
                   for their brother in a secret manner would bind their hearts
                   together, and would be noticed in heaven. I saw that in their
                   prices and wages the rich should make a difference in favor of
                   the afflicted and widows and the worthy poor among them."—

            Part 3   "Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour
        NEIGHBORS unto him that fell among the thieves? And he said, He that
      NEAR AND FAR shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do
                   thou likewise" (Luke 10:36, 37).

                       The Jewish lawyer did not expect to have to confess that a
                     hated Samaritan could act in a neighborly fashion. Yet the story
                     Jesus told could not be understood in any other way. Rather
                     than lisp the word "Samaritan," he used a circumlocution: "He
                     that shewed mercy on him."

                       What instruction was given the Jews regarding their
                     neighbors? Lev. 19:18, 33, 34; Prov. 3:28, 29.

                       Love is the fulfilling of the law, because God is love. And there
                     are to be no limits to love just as there are no limits to God's love.
                     The person who loves only his relatives is doing only what is part
                     of his natural inclinations; the heathen do likewise. When a
                     Christian is a partaker of the divine nature, then he finds himself
                     reaching out in love and mercy to those around him.

                       Whom, in addition to the neighbor, did Jesus say we are to
                     love? Matt. 5:43-45.

                        The Christian is never to return evil for evil. There must always
                     flow from his heart and lips words and deeds of kindness. This is
                     not easy to do to those who are ungrateful, unsympathetic, and
                     openly hostile. But God Himself faces a like situation with the
                     world, yet He always provides people with their needs. The
                     Christian is to be generous and helpful, not because of any
                     reward he receives, but just because he is a child of God and
                     reflects his Father's image.
                        Loving one's neighbor will mean sharing one's understand-
                     ing of the gospel and extending the invitation to accept Jesus as
                     a personal Saviour. However, it must not be limited to religious
                     goals and objectives. Man's needs are often physical as in the
                     case of the one who had fallen among thieves, and the multitude
                     who had been with Jesus all day and were hungry. The Christian
                     must be prepared to meet needs, both temporal and spiritual.

THINK IT THROUGH       What may happen to the Christian who refuses to share his
                     blessings with his neighbors?

                       "We need to guard against the first deviation from righteous-
                     ness; for one transgression, one neglect to manifest the spirit of
                     Christ, opens the way for another and still another, until the
                     mind is overmastered by the principles of the enemy."—

Concern for Others        LESSON 6                                ❑ Wednesday
                                                                    February 7
        Part 4   "Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha,
      WELFARE which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full
  ORGANIZATIONS of good works and almsdeeds which she did" (Acts 9:36).

                      The name, "Dorcas Society" has been in many cases
                    changed for another title, but the same type of work is still
                    performed and appreciated. Tabitha, or Dorcas, was a woman
                    who was active in sewing for the poor. When she died, Peter was
                    called, and he was shown "the coats and garments which Dor-
                    cas made" (verse 39). Somehow Peter was impressed that he
                    should pray that she be restored to a life of continued service,
                    and a miracle occurred. Not everyone who has lived a life of
                    service is raised to life to continue the service, but the experi-
                    ence of Dorcas was doubtless given to show God's approval of
                    this type of activity.

                      What was the result of the experience of Dorcas? Acts 9:42.

                      Some may think that it was the miracle alone that brought
                    many to a knowledge of the truth. But Jesus pointed out that the
                    performance of a miracle does not necessarily produce faith.
                    (See Luke 16:31.) It is more likely that the background of the life
                    of Dorcas, together with her resurrection, called the attention of
                    people to God who could do such a marvelous act. Dorcas's life
                    certainly was the kind of life which God approved of and en-
                    dorsed by raising her to life.

                      What kind of service does God say He prefers from His
                    people? Isa. 58:7.

                      "I cannot too strongly urge all our church members, all who
                    are true missionaries, all who believe the third angel's message,
                    all who turn away their feet from the Sabbath, to consider the
                    message of the fifty-eighth chapter of Isaiah. The work of be-
                    neficence enjoined in this chapter is the work that God requires
                    His people to do at this time. It is a work of His own appoint-
                    ment."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 265.

                      How did Jesus say men come to glorify God? Matt. 5:14,16.

                      Too often we belittle the humble deeds of everyday life. But
                    the fact is that what we do counts for much more than what we
                    say. People will be more impressed with the life of the minister
                    than by his sermons, by the kindly deeds of the members of the
                    church rather than the doctrines.

 THINK IT THROUGH     Is your church doing all that it might do for its community?
                    Are you sharing in preparations for emergency situations? If
                    not, why not?

                                                                         February 8
            Part 5   "If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he
      REACHING THE be thirsty, give him water to drink: for thou shalt heap coals of
        UNLOVABLE fire upon his head, and the Lord shall reward thee" (Prov.
                   25:21, 22).

                        There are certain people we would rather stay away from,
                      some that we feel like fighting. The Scripture says that the way
                      to defeat an enemy is to be kind to him! In other words there is
                      no one who is outside the pale of our beneficence!

                        How did God set the pattern of being concerned for sinners
                      and enemies? Rom. 5:6-10.

                        If we wait for people to be loving to us before we are loving to
                      them, we shall probably wait a long time. The Christian goes
                      about doing good to all because that was exactly what Jesus
                      did. (See Acts 10:38.)

                        How may the Christian be saved from being weary of doing
                      good to those who are not appreciative or thankful? Heb. 12:3.

                         No one was more rejected than Jesus. He came to the world
                      which He had created, and the people whom He had chosen
                      rejected Him. (See John 1:11.) The Christian, too, may be re-
                      jected on many occasions. He may even have to forfeit his life.
                         There are times when the Christian may feel that he has a right
                      to be indignant, that he should teach someone a lesson. But the
                      fact is that God is the only righteous judge in every situation,
                      and the Christian must leave it to Him to do what is necessary.
                      He never pays back evil for evil, but he overcomes evil with
                      good. (See Rom. 12:17-21.)
                         Some question the efficacy of such a policy of kindness to all.
                      They ask the question: May not kindness be interpreted by the
                      enemy as weakness? Does not the wicked man take advantage
                      of the kindness of the Christian and never reform? Doubtless
                      this is often true. But surely the one who continues to do evil in
                      the face of kindness is going to have to face a righteous judge
                      who will take all things into account. And the fact is that kind-
                      ness and love win in the end, even though there may be an
                      apparent defeat in the present. The Christian is to do the right
                      thing at all times and leave the consequences to God.

THINK IT THROUGH        Can you think of examples of times when love has won out in
                      a conflict between truth and error?

                        "Love will gain the victory when argument and authority are
                      powerless. Love works not for profit nor reward; yet God has
                      ordained that great gain shall be the certain result of every labor
                      of love."—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 135.

                                                                      February 9
         Part 6    "In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold
        SOWING not thine hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper,
       THE SEED either this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good"
                (Eccl. 11:6).

                     There is no time when the Christian cannot or should not do
                   good. Morning, noon, and night are all suitable occasions. In
                   this regard he is like a sower who sows his seed. It is God who
                   gives the increase; but the sower must sow the seed.

                     What parable did Jesus give to show how the kingdom of
                   heaven is like sowing seeds? Mark 4:26-29.

                     In this parable Jesus makes it clear that it is God who causes
                   the seed to grow and develop. "The work of the sower is a work
                   of faith. The mystery of the germination and growth of the seed
                   he cannot understand. But he has confidence in the agencies by
                   which God causes vegetation to flourish. In casting his seed
                   into the ground, he is apparently throwing away the precious
                   grain that might furnish bread for his family. But he is only
                   giving up a present good for a larger return. He casts the seed
                   away, expecting to gather it manyfold in an abundant harvest.
                   So Christ's servants are to labor, expecting a harvest from the
                   seed they sow."—Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 64, 65.

                     What assurance is given that when a person sows a good
                   deed, he will rejoice in the consequences? Ps. 126:6; Eccl.
                   11:1.

                     It is human to want to see results. We should remember
                   that the controversy between good and evil is a long, drawn-out
                   battle, and that we may have to wait until we get into the king-
                   dom before we can see all the good that has been done.

                    According to what does God reward those who trust in Him?
                   Rev. 22:12.

                     "Not the amount of labor performed or its visible results but
                   the spirit in which the work is done makes it of value with
                   God."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 397.

THINK IT THROUGH     Am I using my talent in the Master's service? Am I as con-
                   cerned about others as I am for myself?

                     The Christian should not devote himself to only one phase of
                   activity. Just as he needs to eat, work, and sleep in order to meet
                   his physical requirements, so he must care for his own spiritual
                   needs and not neglect his obligations to others.

         THE GREAT all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things"
            GIVER (Rom. 8:32).

                       No one can read the gospel without being impressed with the
                     great sacrifice that God made in giving His Son to die for man.
                     No wonder the songwriter exclaims, "Amazing grace!"

                       What is Paul's reaction to God's gift to man? 2 Cor. 9:15.

                        "Unspeakable. Literally, 'that which cannot be described in
                     full.' There can be no full and complete exposition of the gift of
                     divine love. This ascription of praise to God provides a fitting
                     climax to the section dealing with the collection of a gift for the
                     saints at Jerusalem.... The divine gift, by which men are saved,
                     sanctified, and motivated to Christian service for others, is be-
                     yond human ability to comprehend in its fullness. Christ is often
                     described in the Scriptures as God's supreme gift to man."—
                     SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 898.

                      Having given us His Son, what other provisions has God
                     made for us? Rom. 8:32.

                        Paul makes clear that there is no limit to what God is willing to
                     give to His children. He has not only redeemed man by the death
                     of His Son, but has also provided everything necessary for a full
                     and abundant life. (See John 10:10.) These gifts are all given
                     freely. Man has only to reach out and accept them.

                       What kind of gifts come from God to man? James 1:17.

                        God is the Author of only that which is good. His gifts are
                     perfect. His plans and purposes for man are for his highest good,
                     so that there is no legitimate ambition that man could dream up
                     for himself that could be any more desirable than the goal that
                     God Himself has already set. Just as God is supremely great, so
                     He is the greatest Giver. At the same time, God never changes;
                     therefore, the plans He has for man are established forever. It
                     is only man who causes changes, either by not accepting the
                     plan outlined for him, or not living up to the requirements that
                     are set for complete fulfillment.

THINK IT THROUGH       Since by definition God is perfect, is it possible for God to
                     have other than a perfect plan for man? Why is it that more
                     people are not seeking to fulfill God's plan in their lives?

                       "Every man has his place in the eternal plan of heaven.
                     Whether we fill that place depends upon our own faithfulness in
                     co-operating with God."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 476.

The Grace of Giving        LESSON 7                                    ❑ Monday
                                                                      February 12
          Part 2     How should the believer react to the love of Christ?
         MAN'S
   RESPONSE TO       "The love of Christ controls us, because we are convinced
   GOD'S GIVING    that one has died for all; therefore all have died. And he died
                   for all, that those who live might live no longer for themselves
                   but for him who for their sake died and was raised" (2 Cor.
                   5:14, 15).

                     As a person faces the plan of redemption, the reasonable
                   choice is for him to choose to dedicate his life to the One who
                   gave everything for him. In fact, the price he pays in dedication
                   cannot come anywhere near the price that has been paid for his
                   ransom. No wonder Isaac Watts exclaimed:

                       "When I survey the wondrous cross
                       On which the Prince of glory died,
                       My richest gain I count but loss,
                       And pour contempt on all my pride."
                                    —The Church Hymnal, no. 118.


                     How is the believer to relate to things that are his own and
                   those that belong to others? Phil. 2:4.

                     Unfortunately man is naturally selfish. He thinks of his own
                   affairs rather than the affairs of others. Paul noted this rather
                   sadly when he said: "For all seek their own, not the things which
                   are Jesus Christ's" (Phil. 2:21).
                     It is of the nature of love not to seek her own (1 Cor. 13:5), and
                   when man is filled with the love of Christ, then his thoughts go
                   out to the needs of others. "Those who feel the constraining
                   love of God do not ask how little may be given in order to obtain
                   the heavenly reward; they ask not for the lowest standard, but
                   aim at a perfect conformity to the will of their Redeemer."—
                   Testimonies, vol. 1, p. 160.

                    What Is the example that Jesus set for a life of ministry?
                   Matt. 20:28.

                     The Christian no longer serves himself; he serves his Lord. He
                   can put his whole heart into his work because he is not working
                   for men, but for God. (See Col. 3:23, 24.)
                     What is the result of such service? Life has more meaning.
                   Work is done better. Supervisors are more pleased and note the
                   source of faithfulness. There is greater joy, healthier relation-
                   ships, and opportunity for wider witness and service. ,

             Part 3     According to the wise man, what is one cause of poverty?
          PARADOX
         OF GIVING      "One man gives freely, yet grows all the richer;
                          another withholds what he should give, and only suffers
                          want.
                        A liberal man will be enriched,
                          and one who waters will himself be watered."
                                                        Prov. 11:24, 25, RSV.


                        It seems strange that a man may have more at the end by
                      giving away, and that he may find himself with less than he had
                      at the beginning if he hangs on to what he has.
                        "Scattereth. Not every kind of scattering brings an increase.
                      Careless giving often does harm both to the giver and to the
                      receiver; but the loving, thoughtful endeavor to use one's
                      means to alleviate the sufferings and aid the struggles of those
                      in need, brings wealth to both. The more the giver's means are
                      used to help others, the more he receives. The same is true of
                      contributions made for the work of God (see v. 25). Withholding
                      more than is right tends to poverty, both spiritual and material."
                      —S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 986.

                       What is the secret of successful accomplishment of Christ's
                      work by the believer? Matt. 25:14-30.

                        What lesson on giving is taught in 2 Corinthians 9:6?

                        "As we distribute God's temporal blessings, the evidence of
                      our love and sympathy awakens in the receiver gratitude and
                      thanksgiving to God. The soil of the heart is prepared to receive
                      the seeds of spiritual truth. And He who ministers seed to the
                      sower will cause the seed to germinate and bear fruit unto
                      eternal life."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 86.
                        Are records kept of the offerings given by God's people?
                        "I was shown that the recording angel makes a faithful record
                      of every offering dedicated to God and put into the treasury, and

THINK IT THROUGH        When a person has made his offering to the Lord, is he also
                      responsible for the way it is used in the church?

The Grace of Giving       LESSON 7                               ❑ Wednesday
                                                                  February 14
         Part 4   "And if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the
   THE REWARDS afflicted soul; then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and thy
      OF GIVING darkness be as the noon day: and the Lord shall guide thee
                continually, and satisfy thy soul in drought, and make fat thy
                bones: and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a
                spring of water, whose waters fail not" (Isa. 58:10, 11).

                     Peter asked: "Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed
                   thee; what shall we have therefore?" (Matt. 19:27).

                     What was Jesus' response to Peter's question regarding a
                   reward for having made sacrifices? Matt. 19:28-30.
                     There were times when Jesus did not answer the questions of
                   His disciples. For instance, when they asked about the time of
                   the restoration of the kingdom to Israel, Jesus said that it was
                   not for them to know. (See Acts 1:6, 7.) But when they asked
                   about the results of doing right, Jesus did not hesitate to tell
                   them that sacrifice will be rewarded.

                     From what Jesus said in Matthew 6:31, 32, what did He
                   regard as an important cause of human anxiety?

                     There is a sense of security in a large bank balance. But the
                   parable of the rich fool shows that this is a false security. (See
                   Luke 12:16-20.) There is only one place where treasure is se-
                   cure, and that is in heaven. (See verse 33.)

                     What was a rich young ruler asked to do with his personal
                   property? Matt. 19:21.
                      Without knowing it, the rich young ruler had an idol in his
                   heart. He wanted the privileges of heaven, but he also wanted to
                   cling to his earthly treasures. He thought he was good because
                   he kept the commandments. But the fact was that in his selfish-
                   ness he was a transgressor of the law. It is impossible to serve
                   God and mammon. (See Luke 16:13.)

THINK IT THROUGH    If it is difficult for a rich man to enter the kingdom, why does
                   God bless some people with wealth?

                      "The ruler's possessions were entrusted to him that he might
                   prove himself a faithful steward; he was to dispense these
                   goods for the blessing of those in need. So God now entrusts
                   men with means, with talents and opportunities, that they may
                   be His agents in helping the poor and the suffering. He who uses
                   his entrusted gifts as God designs becomes a co-worker with
                   the Saviour. He wins souls to Christ, because he is a representa-

            Part 5   "If there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to
      THE MEASURE that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not" (2 Cor.
         OF A GIFT 8:12).

                       God does not measure a gift by monetary value. If He did, the
                     poor would feel left out. If you had it in your power to give, would
                     you give? That is the question.

                       On what basis was the offering of two mites considered of
                     great value? Mark 12:44.

                        Giving can show a dependence upon God, or it can glorify self.
                     When people give what is left over, they are indicating that God
                     is last in their priorities. When we place God first in our lives,
                     then everything else that we need will be supplied.

                       What promise do we have that God can and will supply all
                     our needs? Phil. 4:19.

                       Giving is always an act of faith. It is saying, "0 Lord, I could
                     make use of this money, but I can see that there is a great need,
                     and I am willing to help. Thank You for giving me the grace to
                     give. I know You will always abundantly supply my needs. You
                     are really good to me. Once again, Thank You."

                       What is the measure by which we decide the extent of our
                     giving? 1 Cor. 16:2.

                        "As God hath prospered." If we get nothing, we give nothing!
                     Is this a fair enough arrangement? God does not expect the
                     unreasonable, nor does He intend that we should lack any good
                     thing. When we recognize that God has been good to us, then
                     we find it a privilege, not only to turn in our tithes, but also to
                     turn in a generous offering for all the needy causes around us. In
                     fact God has promised that He will always give us enough so
                     that we can be generous in our giving. Here is the pertinent text:
                     "Now he who provides seed for sowing and bread for food will
                     provide the seed for you to sow; he will multiply it and swell the
                     harvest of your benevolence, and you will always be rich
                     enough to be generous" (2 Cor. 9:10, 11, NEB).

THINK IT THROUGH       If God does not really need our gifts, why does He ask us to
                     give?

                         "When Christ's followers give back to the Lord His own, they
                      are accumulating treasure which will be given to them when
                      they shall hear the words, 'Well done, good and faithful servant;
                      . . . enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.' "—The Desire of Ages,

                                                                     February 16
         Part 6   "Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let
   THE CHEERFUL him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a
         GIVER  cheerful giver" (2 Cor. 9:7).

                      The way a gift is made determines the way it can be received.
                   God does not accept a gift made reluctantly. To give cheerfully
                   is to enjoy giving. This takes the grace of God in the heart.

                     What did Jesus say was the basis of giving freely? Matt.
                   10:8.

                      "Easy come; easy go" is one way that people handle money.
                   But that is not the meaning of this verse, nor the way the
                   Christian recognizes his stewardship. The Christian is very
                   much concerned that his money be given to worthy causes. He
                   is not extravagant with his money. But once he recognizes a
                   need, and he knows that God has blessed him with all that he
                   has, he gladly opens up his purse and places in the offering
                   plate that which represents a desire that good may come, in a
                   spirit of gratitude that God has been good to him.

                     What does Matthew 5:23, 24 teach us about giving and our
                   relationship with other people?

                     We do not buy our way into the kingdom by our gifts. Our
                   giving is part of a religious experience in which we perform our
                   duty only after we know that we hold no grudge against anyone
                   and no one has a grudge against us. To be right with God means
                   that we are right also with our fellowmen.

                     What statement of Jesus, not referred to in the Gospels, was
                   quoted by Paul? Acts 20:35.

                     Luke tells us that Jesus suggested that those who invite
                   people to dinner ought to invite the poor, rather than relatives or
                   the rich. In this way hospitality can be given without thought of
                   returned favor. To give with the thought of return is not to give in
                   the true sense of the term.

THINK IT THROUGH     In what sense is it true that "happiness lies more in giving
                   than in receiving"? Does receiving make one feel inferior?
                   obligated? Does giving make one feel superior? condescend-
                   ing?

                      "In the days of Israel the tithe and freewill offerings were
                   needed to maintain the ordinances of divine service. Should the
                   people of God give less in this age? The principle laid down by
                   Christ is that our offerings to God should be in proportion to the
                   light and privileges enjoyed."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 528.

                                                                     February 18
           Part 1     What characteristics of God and man do we find in the
       MALE AND     creation of Adam and Eve?
         FEMALE
                      "So God created man in his own Image, in the image of God
                    created he him; male and female created he them" (Gen.
                    1:27).

                     The creation of Adam and Eve has much to tell us regarding
                    God on the one hand and man on the other.

                      Why did God create people? Isa. 43:7.

                       When God created man it was to be his privilege to reflect
                    God's image in all his relationships of life. We have seen the
                    tragedy that takes place when man rejects God and decides to
                    go his own way. But the lesson of Scripture is that man has the
                    opportunity of accepting a full and free salvation whereby he
                    can live to the honor and glory of God.

                      What is the significance of male and female In the creation
                    of man? Gen. 1:27, 28; 2:20; 3:20.

                       It is significant that generic man is basically two persons; a
                    man and a woman. They can anticipate each other's needs,
                    cooperate in pursuing certain objectives, and share the joys of
                    achievement and communion. Man and woman together com-
                    plement each other, and in the ideal always work together to
                    achieve common goals. Neither one dominates the other or
                    makes claims from the other that are unreasonable.
                       This relationship of two persons, each having an individual
                    personality and experience, coming together to share their lives
                    in unity and harmony and love, is a part of the image of God that
                    needs to be reflected in a Christian home.

                      How did Adam express the closeness of the relationship
                    between himself and Eve? Gen. 2:23.

                      The Bible emphasizes a close relationship between husband
                    and wife which transcends sex.

THINK IT THROUGH      How does the relationship between the members of the
                    family reflect the image of God? Does the concept of the
                    Trinity give us any clue?

                      "As the coin bears the image and superscription of the reign-
                    ing power, so man at his creation bore the image and
                    superscription of God; and though now marred and dim
                    through the influence of sin, the traces of this inscription re-
                    main upon every soul. God desires to recover that soul and to
                    retrace upon it His own image in righteousness and
                    holiness."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 194._

Obligations in the Home         LESSON 8                            ❑ Monday
                                                                   February 19
          Part 2   How did God proceed to provide Adam with a suitable part-
       CHOOSING ner in life?
      A PARTNER
                   "And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made
                 he a woman, and brought her unto the man" (Gen. 2:22).

                     Read verses 20-24.
                     The following aspects of the Bible story should be noted:
                     1. Adam had a need for a partner. He had just concluded
                   giving names to the creatures that God had created. But not one
                   of them could stand by Adam's side as an equal.
                     2. Eve was a special creation from Adam, so that Adam could
                   say: "bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh."
                     3. God provided the one who was to be Adam's partner, one
                   who was to be suitable in every respect.
                     4. Adam and Eve became one flesh in marriage. They set up a
                   family unit that in future generations was to be separate from
                   that of father and mother.
                     5. The biological relationship is only one aspect of the family
                   unit. In the family of man we have two independent people
                   corning together to live a life of one complementing the other,
                   neither losing his personality in the other, neither dominating
                   the other, but both working together in harmony and love to
                   achieve the purpose of bringing glory to God in their fellowship.

                     How does one find a partner In life? What example Is given
                   by Abraham In the choice of a wife for Isaac? Genesis 24.

                     Customs vary from country to country, but certain principles
                   are clear:
                     1. God's counsel and guidance should be sought before a
                   decision is made.
                     2. A marriage always involves the other members of the family
                   so that they should be consulted.
                     3. The couple must be united on religious principles.
                     4. The couple should be mature enough, and responsible
                   enough, so that the decision to marry is not based on sentiment
                   alone, but on a recognition of all that marriage involves and a
                   willingness to meet all of life's responsibilities.

THINK IT THROUGH    Why is marriage not purely a personal matter? How can one
                   who Is not married find fulfillment In life? (See 1 Cor. 7:8.)

                     "The grace of Christ, and this alone, can make this institution
                   [marriage] what God designed it should be—an agent for the
                   blessing and uplifting of humanity. And thus the families of
                   earth, in their unity and peace and love, may represent the
                   family of heaven."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing,

             Part 3     What did Jesus teach about the sanctity of marriage?
          MARRIAGE
         FOR KEEPS      "What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put
                      asunder" (Mark 10:9).

                        Jesus Himself instituted marriage in'Eden. When He was on
                      earth He attended a marriage feast at Cana, thus placing His
                      approval on marriage, although He Himself did not marry.
                        But human nature being what it is, marriages have often
                      broken up. In the time of Moses, provision was made for di-
                      vorce. (See Deut. 24:1.) But Jesus pointed out that it is not God's
                      plan that men and women should marry and divorce. (See Mark
                      10:5.) Marriage is for keeps!

                        What was the experience of Hosea that shows that serious
                      difficulties can arise in a marriage? Hosea 1:2, 3; 3:1-3.

                         Hosea in his relationship with his wife was experiencing the
                      heartaches and longings of God Himself toward His people.
                      God loves His people and wants to be married to them. Yet when
                      they turn to false gods and accept false doctrines, they are
                      committing adultery. God desires a relationship of constancy,
                      and if that relationship is broken, He desires that His people
                      return to Him in repentance, and He promises that He will not
                      turn anyone away. (See Hosea 2:19, 20.)
                         The wise man says, "Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good
                      thing, and obtaineth favour of the Lord" (Prov. 18:22). Marriage
                      is an experience that brings joy and fulfillment, and when it is
                      pursued with the blessing of God, it results in a broader concept
                      of the meaning of life. This is not to say that there are no
                      problems, adjustments, or sacrifices. On the contrary, one has
                      to work hard at a marriage to make it successful. There must be
                      give and take on both sides if the relationship is to persist. The
                      devil doubtless seeks to ruin a marriage, but we must not give
                      him the opportunity. (See Eph. 4:27.) The secret of success in
                      this is found in James 4:7. "Be submissive then to God. Stand up
                      to the devil and he will turn and run. Come close to God, and he
                      will come close to you" (NEB).

THINK IT THROUGH        Why did Jesus insist on the indissolubility of marriage?

                        "Among the Jews a man was permitted to put away his wife
                      for the most trivial offenses, and the woman was then at liberty
                      to marry again. This practice led to great wretchedness and sin.
                      In the Sermon on the Mount Jesus declared plainly that there
                      could be no dissolution of the marriage tie, except for unfaith-
                      fulness to the marriage vow."—Thoughts From the Mount of

           Part 4   "Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord: and the fruit of the
           WHEN womb is his reward" (Ps. 127:3).
       CHILDREN
           COME     "Children derive life and being from their parents, and yet it is
                  through the creative power of God that your children have life,
                  for God is the Life-giver. Let it be remembered that children are
                  not to be treated as though they were our own personal prop-
                  erty. Children are the heritage of the Lord, and the plan of
                  redemption includes their salvation as well as ours. They have
                  been entrusted to parents in order that they might be brought
                  up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, that they might be
                  qualified to do their work in time and eternity."—The Adventist
                  Home, p. 280.

                     What did Jacob recognize in the matter of procreation? Gen.
                   30:1, 2.

                      Jacob thought he had some understanding of genetics. (See
                   Gen. 30:37-42.) But the true explanation is given in Genesis
                   31:10, 12. He recognized that God was in control, and we cannot
                   live meaningfully without taking this factor into consideration.
                      This is not to say that God often interferes with genetic or
                   biological processes. Man is a free moral agent, and doubtless
                   God has often permitted him to do things so that he can see the
                   results. We need only to point up the fact that not everything in
                   this life is the result of earthly cause and effect. God in His mercy
                   can withhold the effects of sin, and in His love He can abun-
                   dantly bless. To have children is a blessing, but not to have them
                   may also be a blessing in disguise. And parents need to look to
                   God at all times in supplication and thanksgiving.
                      Children are a joy and a sacred responsibility, objects of love
                   and attention. They are individuals who will one day stand on
                   their own.

THINK IT THROUGH      To what extent are parents responsible for the number of
                    children they have?

                       "Those professing to be Christians should not enter the mar-
                    riage relation until the matter has been carefully and prayerfully
                    considered from an elevated standpoint to see if God can be
                    glorified by the union. Then they should duly consider the result
                    of every privilege of the marriage relation, and sanctified princi-
                    ple should be the basis of every action. Before increasing their
                    family, they should take into consideration whether God would
                    be glorified or dishonored by bringing children into the world.
                    . .. They have no right to bring children into the world to be a
                    burden to others."—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 380.

Obligations in the Home              LESSON 8                             ❑ Thursday
                                                                          February 22
              Part 5     "Whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in
        THE WORTH      me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about
         OF A CHILD    his neck, and that he were drowned In the depth of the sea"
                       (Matt. 18:6).

                         Jesus had a high regard for children, higher than the disciples
                       had.

                         When mothers brought their children to Jesus to be blessed
                       of Him, what did the disciples try to do? Matt. 19:13-15.

                         Sometimes adults think their work is so important that they
                       have no time for the children. And it is true that their work is very
                       important. But so are the children. Children need to learn of
                       Jesus, and parents must never be so busy that they cannot de-
                       vote adequate time to teach their children about Him.

                         What reason did Jesus give why we should not despise
                       children? Matt. 18:10.

                         God has a special care for those who are weak; His angels are
                       ready to serve in every need. Seeing this is the case, we should
                       be careful lest we despise anyone who has not reached our
                       standards. It is not for us to despise anyone, but to cooperate
                       with the heavenly angels for the salvation of everyone.

                         What necessary characteristic did Jesus say His followers
                       must possess in order to enter the kingdom of heaven? Matt.
                       18:3-5.

                         It is amazing sometimes how much we can learn from little
                       children. They have insights that are well worth considering.
                       Furthermore, they rarely put on airs. They have a faith and trust
                       in God and in their parents that is exemplary to older people
                       who soon become sophisticated, hypocritical, and proud. Jesus
                       would have us emulate children in humility and implicit confi-
                       dence in God's love and care. Only in this way can we hope to
                       enter into the kingdom.

THINK IT THROUGH         What lessons have you learned from children that are of
                       value to you? In what ways do we fail to give children the care
                       and attention they need?

                         "The children and youth are Christ's purchased possession;
                       He has bought them with an infinite price. Jesus loves the little
                       ones. . . . And Jesus bids the angels to take special charge of
                       these inexperienced souls, in their homes, in their school life,
                       and in the Sabbath school."—Counsels on Sabbath School

          Part 6   "Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above
       UNITY IN rubies. The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her."
     THE FAMILY    "Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband
                 also, and he praiseth her" (Prov. 31:10, 11, 28).

                     Proverbs 31 praises the wife. Is it not true that most things in
                   the home revolve around the mother?

                     What duties of the wife mentioned in Proverbs 31 do you
                   think are most important?

                     If the family is to be united it must be organized. It must be
                   known who is responsible for what. Each member of the family
                   must do his or her duty. No one should usurp the place of the
                   other. There must be a recognition that there is a head of the
                   house. Each must realize that no one is perfect, and so everyone
                   must be forgiving and understanding and willing to do whatever
                   is necessary for the smooth running of the home. Furthermore,
                   God must be recognized as the real head of the household. He
                   must be worshiped and His commandments obeyed. A chil-
                   dren's song says: "With Jesus in the family, happy, happy
                   home!" How true this is!
                      Unity, order, and discipline in the home are essential to gen-
                   eral well-being. There needs to be respect for one another. All
                   should know what is right and by God's grace seek to do it.
                   When someone fails, he must be prepared to acknowledge his
                   fault and seek to do better. Everyone should use tact and learn
                   to be gracious in approaching another. The parents should set
                   the example. They should gather the family when matters of
                   importance to the home need to be discussed. Thus all may
                   participate in establishing rules and methods of procedure. All
                   must work in harmony.
                      Such a family is not produced in a day! It takes diligent effort
                   and much prayer. It takes patience and self-control. But such a
                   family can be a light in the neighborhood. In fact, their witness
                   may be the strongest argument for Christianity, a more powerful
                   force for good than all the sermons preached and literature
                   distributed.

THINK IT THROUGH     What do you think are some important factors for producing
                   unity in the family? What principles apply to every family?
                   Give examples of practices that may not be suitable to some
                   families?

                     "The restoration and uplifting of humanity begins in the

Responsibilities of Training         LESSON 9                           ❑ Sunday
                                                                       February 25

            Part 1   "Thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and
     THE COMMAND shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when
         TO TEACH thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when
                   thou risest up" (Deut. 6:7).

                       God through Moses gave implicit directions to the children of
                    Israel that they were to teach their children the laws that had
                    been handed down to them. They were to do that at all times, in
                    all places, in every way possible. If the children of Israel were to
                    fail in anything, they were not to fail in passing on to every
                    generation the religious precepts that they had received.

                      Why was God so particular about having parents teach their
                    children? Deut 6:3.

                      God's promises of health and prosperity were dependent on
                    the people keeping and obeying the commandments. The
                    commandments had been given in the first instance with the
                    welfare of the people in mind. In order that they would never
                    forget the laws, they were told to bind them on the hand, place
                    them on the forehead, and write them on the doorposts of their
                    houses (verses 8, 9). But more importantly, they were to have
                    them in their hearts (verse 6).

                      What instruction was given to Peter regarding the lambs of
                    the flock? John 21:15-17.

                       The Bible writers often used the figure of speech of a
                    shepherd caring for his sheep. Jesus Himself is the Good
                    Shepherd. (See Psalm 23; John 10:11.) Jesus used this figure
                    when He commissioned Peter to do the work of an under-
                    shepherd. He told him to care for the lambs and the sheep. This
                    charge to Peter points out to the church today their responsibil-
                    ity to provide the necessary teachers and facilities for the chil-
                    dren to learn about Jesus and the plan of salvation.
                       It is to be expected that children will ask their parents why
                    they do this and that and the other. Parents need to have a ready
                    answer, telling of their experiences and pointing the children to
                    the Word of God. (Read Deut. 6:20-25.)
                       "God had commanded the Hebrews to teach their children
                    His requirements and to make them acquainted with all His
                    dealings with their fathers. This was one of the special duties of

                                                                     February 26
          Part 2    "This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true
     CONTENT OF    God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent" (John 17:3).
       TEACHING
                    There is no higher education than that which teaches about
                   God. We need to know who He is, what He has done, and what
                   He requires of man.

                     How may all the law and the prophets be summarized? Matt.
                   22:37-40.

                     The controversy of the ages has been about the character of
                   God. People often hate God when they do not know Him. To
                   know God as He really is, to know what He has done for us and
                   does for us every day, is to love Him. The most important teach-
                   ing that any parent can give his child is a knowledge of God and
                   His great love.

                     What are the main sources of knowledge about God? Ps.
                   19:1; 46:10; 2 Tim. 3:15.

                     Although nature suffers the blight of sin, there is still much
                   that reveals the greatness and the glory of God. (See Rom. 1:20.)
                   Just to be still and meditate upon life and its many implications
                   can reveal to one that there is a God. Experience is another
                   teacher; a man can have an inner conviction that God loves him
                   and provides for him. But of course the outstanding source of a
                   knowledge of God is in His Word, where we learn about His
                   character and His dealings with men through the centuries. The
                   Word of God is a light that illuminates the pathway of life and
                   enables us to understand many things that would otherwise be
                   incomprehensible. (See Ps. 119:105.)

                     Where do we find the supreme revelation of God? John 14:9.

                     When Jesus is lifted up, all men are drawn to Him. (See John
                   12:32.) We need to learn about Him every day. We need to reveal
                   Him to others. To the young people He must be presented as
                   their Saviour and Friend.
                     "The science of redemption is the science of all sciences; the
                   science that is the study of the angels and of all the intelligences
                   of the unfallen worlds.... This is the highest study in which it is
                   possible for man to engage. As no other study can, it will
                   quicken the mind and uplift the soul."—Education, p. 126.

THINK IT THROUGH     Parents try to give their children the best gifts. What do you
                   think is the best gift that parents can give to their children?

                                                                         February 27
              Part 3     "Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he Is old,
           NEED OF     he will not depart from It" (Prov. 22:6).
         DISCIPLINE
                          There are some who believe that children should grow up
                       naturally; that to direct and restrain is to frustrate and cause
                       problems for the future. The Bible does not teach this
                       philosophy. On the contrary, the Bible teaches that children are
                       like plants (Ps. 128:3). Plants need protection and pruning if
                       they are to grow up satisfactorily and produce fruit.

                         What lesson can we learn from the story of Eli and his
                       family? 1 Sam. 3:12, 13.

                          As the twig is bent, so is the tree inclined. Human nature
                       being what it is, there is always need of correction. Children
                       inherit from their parents characteristics that need to be re-
                       strained in some instances and encouraged in others. But a
                       child without guidance is like a garden without care, a disgrace
                       to itself and an eyesore to the community.

                         What points does the wise man make about the occasional
                       use of physical punishment? Prov. 13:24; 23:13; 29:15.

                          Children soon know whether punishment is due to loving
                       care or the anger of the parent. Children respond to justice, but
                       they grow resentful when parents are unfair. "Be so calm, so
                       free from anger, that they will be convinced that you love them,
                       even though you punish them."—Child Guidance, p. 249.

                         What are fathers counseled not to do to their children? Col.
                       3:21.

                         Training needs to be tempered with understanding. The
                       needs of each child demand special consideration. What suits
                       one may not suit another. Discipline may not be easy or pleasant
                       to administer, but properly done it results in happy conse-
                       quences. (See Heb. 12:11.)
                         Note that Jesus was subject to His parents as He grew in wis-
                       dom and stature. (See Luke 2:51, 52.) He also learned obedience
                       by the things that He suffered. (See Heb. 5:8.)

THINK IT THROUGH         To what extent, if at all, can the discipline of a child be
                       delegated to someone else? Is there a time when parents
                       cease to train and the teacher takes over?

                         "It is the work of parents and teachers, in the education of the
                       youth, to co-operate with the divine purpose; and in so doing
                       they are 'laborers together with God.' 1 Corinthians 3:9."—

Responsibilities of Training          LESSON 9                     ❑ Wednesday
                                                                    February 28
         Part 4   "Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and
      GOALS OF vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of
     EDUCATION  the world, and not after Christ" (Col. 2:8).

                     The highest goal in education is perfection in Christ Jesus. As
                   a result of sin man has many weaknesses and shortcomings. He
                   may overcome these by God's grace and attain the destiny for
                   which God originally created him.

                     What high ideal does Paul set before us in Ephesians 4:13?

                     Christ set the pattern of true manhood. In word and deed and
                   dedication to ministry He set us a perfect example. He has
                   provided the power by which man can reach that ideal.

                     What did Jesus encourage His disciples to do? Matt. 4:19.

                      Everyone needs a type of work to do, a means of earning a
                   livelihood. But there is more to life than earning a living; there is
                   a goal to reach which far transcends anything this world can
                   offer. In every type of occupation a man must ask himself
                   whether he is also meeting the demands that God has upon him.
                   Here is where he must be sure that his education prepares him
                   not only for the present life but also for the life to come.

                     What does Paul call the wisdom that is of this world? 1 Cor.
                   3:19.

                     The Christian must be careful that he is not deceived by the
                   so-called wisdom of this world. For him "the fear of the Lord is
                   the beginning of wisdom" (Ps. 111:10). He studies the Word of
                   God because he knows he needs to be "wise unto salvation"
                   (2 Tim. 3:15). He knows he has to avoid the mistake the Jews
                   made of placing the tradition of men above the Word of God.
                   (See Matt. 15:9.) He remembers that the Israelites failed again
                   and again because they associated so closely with their heathen
                   neighbors. The Israelites adopted heathen modes of dress and
                   worship. Thus they failed to accomplish the purpose that God
                   had for them to be a distinct people who portray God's loving
                   care and blessing. God's remnant people must not repeat those
                   mistakes. They must be true to the principles that God has
                   outlined for their lives.

THINK IT THROUGH      Why is It necessary for Seventh-day Adventists to have their
                   own system of education? Is Christian education an option, or
                   is it a necessity?

                     "Teaching your students to be Christians is the greatest work

                                                                         March 1

             Part 5   "If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them" (John
        KNOWLEDGE 13:17).
        AND ACTION
                      There is a close correlation between truth and action. The one
                    who knows the truth lives differently from the one who does not
                    know it. More important than intellectual assent is a practical
                    application of the truth to the life.

                        What did Jesus teach about action in Matthew 21:28-31?

                        What shows that a claim to know God is a true claim? 1 John
                      2:4, 5.

                         When we really know God we respond to Him in love and keep
                      His commandments. Can you imagine anyone saying to a
                      friend, "I love you," and then not doing anything for the friend?
                      True knowledge of a person will lead us to come close to him or
                      to keep him at a distance, depending on what kind of person he
                      is. When we know the laws of health and welfare, we should
                      keep them in order to enjoy the blessings that they bring. It is
                      utter foolishness not to do what we know to be right, and to do
                      those things that will result in injury.

                        From where did Daniel and his friends receive their knowl-
                      edge? Dan. 1:17.

                        God is the Source of all knowledge, and He will impart this to
                      those who diligently seek Him. Paul says that knowledge makes
                      a man proud. (See 1 Cor. 8:1.) But then again people can be
                      destroyed by lack of knowledge. (See Hosea 4:6.) Paul was a
                      learned man, but he counted all things as garbage compared to
                      the knowledge of Christ he wished to have. (See Phil. 3:8, NEB,
                      TEV, Phillips.)
                        There are aspects of knowledge that we do not need. Adam
                      and Eve fell through seeking a knowledge of sin. We do not
                      need to experience some things in life in order to know them.
                      We may know what they cause in the lives of others and thus
                      know to keep away from them. The Christian will want to learn
                      the knowledge that upbuilds.
THINK IT THROUGH        Why does forbidden knowledge often seem more attractive
                      than the truth?

                        "We have a work to do to resist temptation. Those who would
                      not fall a prey to Satan's devices must guard well the avenues of
                      the soul; they must avoid reading, seeing, or hearing that which
                      will suggest impure thoughts. The mind should not be left to
                      wander at random upon every subject that the adversary of
                      souls may suggest."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 460.

    OF SCHOOLS     have nothing in common. Christ is not the ally of Beliar, nor
                   has a believer anything to share with an unbeliever. The tem-
                   ple of God has no common ground with idols, and that is what
                   we are—the temple of the living God" (2 Cor. 6:14-16,
                   Jerusalem).

                     "The followers of Christ are to separate themselves from
                   sinners, choosing their society only when there is opportunity
                   to do them good. We cannot be too decided in shunning the
                   company of those who exert an influence to draw us away from
                   God."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 459.
                     The first school on earth had the very best location, the finest
                   teacher, the most relevant course of study, and two diligent stu-
                   dents. Ellen White says: "The system of education instituted at
                   the beginning of the world was to be a model for man through-
                   out all aftertime. As an illustration of its principles a model
                   school was established in Eden, the home of our first parents.
                   The Garden of Eden was the schoolroom, nature was the lesson
                   book, the Creator Himself was the instructor, and the parents of
                   the human family were the students."—Education, p. 20.

                     What elements of 2 Kings 2:3-5 and 6:1-7 suggest a school?

                     The schools of the prophets were to "serve as a barrier
                   against the widespread corruption, to provide for the moral and
                   spiritual welfare of the youth, and to promote the future pros-
                   perity of the nation by furnishing it with men qualified to act in
                   the fear of God as leaders and counselors."—Patriarchs and
                   Prophets, p. 593.
                     The students are described as "pious, intelligent, and studi-
                   ous." The subjects taught were the law of God, sacred history,
                   sacred music, and poetry. The students met their expenses by
                   learning and practicing a trade. This plan is still a valid one to
                   follow in our schools today. There is need for Christian schools
                   today to serve as a refuge where young people can learn how
                   best they can serve God and their fellowmen.

THINK IT THROUGH     How does a Christian school differ from other schools? Do
                   our schools provide that kind of an education?

                     "True education does not ignore the value of scientific knowl-
                   edge or literary acquirements; but above information it values
                   power; above power, goodness; above intellectual acquire-
                   ments, character. The world does not so much need men of
                   great intellect as of noble character. It needs men in whom
                   ability is controlled by steadfast principle."—Education, p.225.

                   gods" (Ps. 95:1-3).

                       There is only one who is worthy of worship and praise, and
                     that is our God. Jesus made that clear to Satan when the latter
                     asked for worship. (See Matt. 4:10.)
                       Furthermore, the place of worship is not of paramount impor-
                     tance. Some people try to pinpoint a particular spot as holy, but
                     Jesus said to the woman of Samaria that the main thing is to
                     worship in spirit and in truth. (See John 4:20-24.)

                       Why is It essential that people should worship in spirit and in
                     truth? John 4:24.

                       God is not limited to any one place since He is everywhere.
                     Wherever His children are, there He can be. If it were true that
                     the worshiper could meet God only in one place, then a hard-
                     ship would be imposed on those who could not go there for one
                     reason or another. Since God is readily accessible in every
                     place, there is no excuse for anyone not to worship.

                       What do you understand by the expression "In spirit and in
                     truth"?

                       The result of merely formal worship is that the needs of the
                     worshipers are not met and they go elsewhere to satisfy them.
                     True worship comes from the heart, and the worshiper has a
                     sense of reality and meaningfulness.
                       True worship involves communion, in which there is a recog-
                     nition of the presence of God, and a desire on the part of the
                     worshiper to render homage to God.

                       Whom does the angel flying in the midst of heaven say we
                     ought to worship? Rev. 14:7.

                      Only the One who is the Creator of the universe is worthy of
                     worship.

THINK IT THROUGH       How can the Seventh-day Adventist worshiper avoid mak-
                     ing worship a mere round of ceremonies?

                       "The religion that comes from God is the only religion that will
                     lead to God. In order to serve Him aright, we must be born of the

                                                                           March 5
         Part 2     "Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee
      PLACES OF from thy presence? If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there:
       WORSHIP if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there" (Ps. 139:7, 8).

                     The psalmist strikingly indicates that God is everywhere; he
                   pictures himself trying to flee from Him, and he mentions a
                   number of places which may be considered out of reach; but, lo,
                   God is there!

                     What did Jesus teach the woman of Samaria about the
                   location of worship? John 4:20, 21.

                     There is a human tendency to think that one place is more
                   sacred than another. It is not the place that is sacred, but the
                   presence of God that makes the place sacred. Thus Sinai was a
                   holy mount so long as God was there, and the children of Israel
                   were to approach it with reverence and fear. (See Ex. 19:10-13.)
                   Today Mount Sinai is like any other mountain.

                     Where did Jacob recognize the presence of God? Gen.
                   28:11-17.

                     Jacob was running away for his life. He knew he had done
                   wrong in deceiving his father, and he knew he could expect
                   nothing but death from his brother. Would God forgive him?
                   Would God even consider him? He lay down in discourage-
                   ment; but the next morning he awoke with the assurance that
                   God had not forsaken him; He was by his side, still ready to
                   communicate with him and bless him. He set up an altar and
                   made a vow that he would always serve God. In some places we
                   can say that people are only a telephone call away! With God we
                   can say that He is only a prayer away.

                    In the history of the early church, where did the believers
                   meet for worship? Acts 2:46, 47; Rom. 16:5.

                     There were no church buildings for the early believers. They
                   met wherever it was most convenient—usually in a home. This
                   was a personal fellowship. It tied the members together in
                   bonds of love.

THINK IT THROUGH    How can one make the services in a large church personal?
                   How far does a building help or hinder the spirit of worship?

                      "In all that pertains to the success of God's work, the very first
                   victories are to be won in the home life. Here the preparation for

             Part 3     "Let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among
        BUILDING A    them" (Ex. 25:8).
        SANCTUARY
                         Although God meets with His people anywhere, a particular
                      place for worship is what He desires and expects. At first the
                      altar was the center of worship. (See Gen. 12:8.) Then in the
                      wilderness God asked the children of Israel to build a special
                      tent which would be the symbol of His presence.

                        Why did God ask for a sanctuary to be built? Ex. 25:8.

                        God wants to dwell with His people. How remarkable that God
                      desires to be in the midst of those whom He has chosen! In this
                      way He can guide them, protect them, and meet their every
                      need. There is a two-way process here; men are constantly
                      reminded of their obligations to God, and God in His turn makes
                      them a blessing to themselves and to others.

                        What was the source of the money and the plans for building
                      the sanctuary? Ex. 25:2, 9.
                        This was a joint venture. By giving of their means the people
                      showed that their hearts and minds were with the project. By
                      following the pattern that was presented they were ensuring
                      that the worship would be meaningful and acceptable. Man is
                      not to worship in his own way, but in God's.
                        God also provided the skills necessary for the making of every
                      part of the sanctuary. (See Ex. 31:2-6.) He was concerned about
                      detail, that everything be perfect. A house for worship needs
                      every care in the planning stage and careful attention in every
                      phase. Why is this the case? Is it not to indicate that the house of
                      God must be a true reflection of His perfection? No cheap or
                      shoddy work can_ be accepted. Only the best of materials can be
                      used so that God is honored and exalted.
                        It is also interesting to note that not everyone could build a
                      sanctuary. When David wanted to build a temple in Jeru-
                      salem, he was told that he was not qualified to do so. (See 2
                      Chron. 6:7-9.) He could gather the materials, and he did; but
                      another had to build. What does this tell us about the one who
                      leads out in building a new church? He is to be a dedicated man,
                      working in harmony with God's plans and purposes.

THINK IT THROUGH         How does one choose between qUility and extravagance?
                      What are to be the qualities of a church building that will make
                      it acceptable to God?

                        "Wherever a company of believers is raised up, a house of
                      worship should be built. Let not the workers leave the place

         OF GOD
                       Sometimes an unfavorable comparison can be made be-
                    tween the house of God and the houses we live in. We should
                    always do better for the house of worship than for our own
                    houses. This means that the style and furnishing of the house of
                    God will vary from community to community, but always avoid-
                    ing ostentation. People should respond to God in direct propor-
                    tion to the way they have been blessed.

                     Why was it that the returned exiles worked hard but never
                    made any economic progress? Haggai 1:5-11.

                      People live under God, and the way they live determines
                    whether God can bless them. When the children of Israel re-
                    turned from exile they had built houses for themselves but had
                    neglected to rebuild the temple. They had excused themselves
                    by saying that it was not time to rebuild the temple (verse 2).
                    Their enemies had destroyed the temple once; they might de-
                    stroy it again. Yet they had built houses for themselves. Through
                    the prophet God pointed out their inconsistency, and told them
                    that they must put God first in their lives. They must consider
                    the place of worship before their own comfort.
                       The book of Haggai tells what happened when the people re-
                    pented and began building the Lord's house. Immediately the
                    Lord was with them. They were not to fear, but to press on, and
                    God would make His house glorious (1:4-9; 2:18, 19).

                      What experience lets us know that God desires His people
                    as well as the place of worship to be glorious? Zech. 3:1-10.

                      God loves His people and wants the very best for them. He
                    reclothes His believing people with the rightousness of Jesus
                    and turns aside the accusations of Satan. Then God says He will
                    give them a place close to Himself. (See Haggai 2:23.)

THINK IT THROUGH     Why Is it so essential to build a representative house of
                    God?

                      "A striking illustration of the results of selfishly withholding
                    even freewill offerings from the cause of God was given in the
                    days of the prophet Haggai. . . .
                      "God intended that His people Israel should be light bearers
                    to all the inhabitants of the earth. In maintaining His public
                    worship they were bearing a testimony to the existence and
                    sovereignty of the living God. And this worship it was their
                    privilege to sustain, as an expression of their loyalty and their

             Part 5   "Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them
          A HOUSE joyful In my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their
         OF PRAYER sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar; for mine house
                    shall be called an house of prayer for all people" (Isa. 56:7).

                        There is a danger that familiarity with the house of God will
                      breed contempt. One must ever be conscious of the presence
                      of God and remember that just as we act with dignity and pro-
                      priety before persons we respect, so before God we must act
                      with reverence and awe.
                        How did the people in the time of Jesus show lack of respect
                      for the temple? Matt. 21:12, 13.

                         The services at the temple had become a business for many
                      people. Worshipers who needed temple currency could ex-
                      change their own for that which alone was acceptable in the
                      treasury. There were "authorized dealers" in the temple pre-
                      cincts from whom worshipers could buy animals for sacrifices.
                      Worship in the temple could involve much sharp bargaining. It
                      was an expensive process. Could the poor afford to purchase
                      the necessary sacrifices to fulfill their obligations? Small won-
                      der that Jesus decided to "cleanse" the temple!
                         No one should be prevented from enjoying the full privileges
                      of worship in the house of God because of poverty. Nor should
                      any activity savor of worldly business and interfere with the
                      sanctity of the location or the spirit of the Sabbath day. The
                      house of God is where He meets with His people, and all ac-
                      tivities in it should harmonize with that purpose. It is here that
                      one may receive a call from God, as did Isaiah. (See Isa. 6:1-8.)
                      Or may plead for the answer to one's prayer, as did Hannah.
                      (See 1 Sam. 1:10-15.) Or serve as a doorkeeper as the psalmist
                      was willing to do. (See Ps. 84:10.)

                        How is the Lord to be worshiped in the temple? Ps. 29:2.

                        There is no beauty like the beauty of holiness. And there is no
                      place like the sanctuary where such beauty can be found. Man
                      cannot find rest or satisfaction except as he finds it in God.

THINK IT THROUGH        What rules would you set up for maintaining reverence In
                      the house of God?

                        "Humility and reverence should characterize the deportment
                     of all who come into the presence of God. In the name of Jesus
                     we may come before Him with confidence, but we must not
                     approach Him with the boldness of presumption, as though He
                     were on a level with ourselves."—Patriarchs and Prophets,

                                                                             March 9
         Part 6   "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the
      THE HEART Spirit of God dwelleth in you? If any man defile the temple of
        TEMPLE God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy,
                which temple ye are" (1 Cor. 3:16, 17).

                     When God dwells among His people, He not only meets them
                   in the place of worship; He meets with them in the heart.
                     More than anything else the Lord desires the heart, because
                   out of it are the issues of life. (See Prov. 23:26; 4:23.) He can take
                   the heart of stone and make it a heart of flesh. (See Eze. 36:26.)
                   He writes His laws in the heart so that by continual surrender to
                   Jesus the believer keeps the commandments. (See Jer. 31:33.)
                   By dwelling in the heart He is in control of the life.
                     In view of God's offer to do so much for man, what is the
                   least thing a man can do? Rom. 6:13.

                     Man has one of two ways to choose: Either he becomes a
                   slave of sin and reaps the reward of sin, which is death, or he
                   surrenders his heart to Christ and receives the gift of eternal life.
                   (See verses 16, 23.)

                     What prayer did Paul offer for the Ephesians, and through
                   them, for the church as a whole? Eph. 3:17.

                     Because the body is the temple of the Holy Spirit, we need to
                   give it extra care. We should not defile it with such things as the
                   eating of unclean meats, sexual perversion, or abuse by dis-
                   obeying other laws of health. It is our privilege to maintain our
                   bodies at the peak of their powers for use in God's service.

                     When John the revelator pictures the New Jerusalem com-
                   ing down to earth from heaven, what does the "great voice"
                   say? Rev. 21:3.

                     Sin has caused separation between man and God. It has been
                   the source of all our woes. All heaven is striving for God's
                   reunion with His people. This union and joy can begin on earth
                   by faith in Christ Jesus.

THINK IT THROUGH     What did Stephen mean when he said that "the most High
                   dwelleth not in temples made with hands" (Acts 7:48)?

                     "Although God dwells not in temples made with hands, yet He
                   honors with His presence the assemblies of His people. He has
                   promised that when they come together to seek Him, to ac-
                   knowledge their sins, and to pray for one another, He will meet
                   with them by His Spirit. But those who assemble to worship Him
                   should put away every evil thing."—Prophets and Kings, p. 50.

       THE PROMISE receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be
        TO RETURN   also" (John 14:3).

                        Before the crucifixion Jesus told the disciples that He would
                      be leaving them, but that He would return. They were not to be
                      concerned about His absence. He had a work to do, one of
                      preparation for them so that they could eventually be with Him.

                        Why were the disciples so dull of understanding, when
                      Jesus was so plain in His statements?

                        The disciples, like the rest of the Jewish nation, had their
                      preconceived ideas regarding the Messiah. They thought of
                      freedom from Roman oppression.

                        What words does Paul use to refer to the second coming of
                      Jesus? Titus 2:13.
                        For Paul the second coming of Jesus was an event he looked
                      forward to with joy. And Hebrews 10:37 shows full confidence in
                      the fulfillment of the promise. God's people need patience in
                      view of delays (see James 5:8), but their hearts should never
                      waver.

                        In view of the second coming, what should every Christian
                      be doing? 1 John 3:3.

                        Of course no one can cleanse himself of sin. But the will must
                      be on Christ's side of the controversy, and the believer must
                      cooperate with the Lord. The Christian who is establishing his
                      faith ever more strongly has no time for doubt or questioning.
                      Delay for him is a form of grace in which he has another oppor-
                      tunity to do what is right and fulfill God's purposes.

                       What does Peter say Is the reason for apparent delay in
                      Christ's coming? 2 Peter 3:8, 9.

                       This truth is a mercy and a challenge. It is a mercy for many of
                     us that Jesus has not come yet. But it is also a challenge to hurry
                     up and repent of our I u kewarmness. Why should we detain the
                     Saviour we are anxious to see?

        A TASK gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized
     PRESENTED shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned"
                (Mark 16:15, 16).

                    While Jesus is in heaven preparing a place for His people, His
                  disciples on earth are to be preparing to meet God.

                   What did Jesus say would happen before the end of the
                  world came? Matt. 24:14.

                    There is a task to be done. We speed the day of the second
                  advent as we accomplish the task that has been entrusted to the
                  church.
                    It is to be noted that Jesus said the gospel of the kingdom
                  would be preached "as a witness." There is no suggestion here
                  that everyone will accept the testimony given. People are free to
                  accept or reject. The objective is that everyone will have the
                  opportunity to know what issues are at stake and will be able to
                  make a responsible decision one way or the other.

                    What is the gospel commission? Matt. 28:19, 20.

                    The New English Bible translates the Greek: "Go forth there-
                  fore and make all nations my disciples." The gospel is to be
                  preached with an urgency and a desire that all men should
                  accept the invitation. There must be no halfhearted measures,
                  no mere proclamation without attempt to persuade. Christian
                  witness with a full realization of the issues at stake, eternal life
                  or eternal loss. When there is love and concern for fellow human
                  beings, there can only be a pleading that the right decision be
                  made.

                   What authority did Jesus say He had, and what promise did
                  He make? Matt. 28:18, 20.

                    With all the authority of heaven behind us and the presence of
                  Jesus with us, we can go forth with confidence and do the
                  necessary work and that the work will be finished. Problems of
                  language, culture, politics, and an ever increasing population
                  will not stand in our way. As we cooperate with God, the task will
                  be accomplished.
                    "Christ desires by the fullness of His power so to strengthen
                  His people that through them the whole world shall be encircled
                  with an atmosphere of grace. When His people shall make a
                  wholehearted surrender of themselves to God, this purpose will
                  be accomplished."—Testimonies, vol. 7, p. 148.

                  of waters" (Rev. 14:6, 7).

                        God's final messengers to the world proclaim the everlasting
                     gospel. The good news of salvation was first announced to
                     Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, and repeated century after
                     century till the time of Christ when there was a visible represen-
                     tation of it. It was then preached by the apostles and the church
                     ever since. The only message of vital concern to man is the one
                     that tells him of a Saviour who has made ample provision for his
                     freedom from sin and the joy of life everlasting.

                      What makes the message of the first angel so relevant to
                     man today? Rev. 14:7.

                       We are living in the hour of judgment. We are living in a day
                     when people doubt the Creation story as told in Genesis. God's
                     last message calls men to recognize God as the One who origin-
                     ated the world and who brings its civilization to an end.

                       What religious practice affirms the truth of God's creator-
                     ship? Ex. 20:10, 11.

                       The issue of the last days includes the matter of the day of
                     worship: will it be the day which God blessed and Christ claimed
                     as His own? (See Mark 2:27, 28.) Or will it be the day chosen by
                     men as the one most convenient for their purposes and sup-
                     ported by human legislation? When the issue is clear, people
                     will be called upon to take a stand for the truth, thus receiving
                     the seal of God, while others will receive a mark in their hands or
                     in their foreheads, indicating that they choose to serve an
                     earthly power rather than the plain command of God.

THINK IT THROUGH       Am I making the necessary preparations to be able to stand
                     when the final crisis comes upon the world? What should I be
                     doing now?

                       "The great, grand work of bringing out a people who will have
                     Christlike characters, and who will be able to stand in the day of
                     the Lord, is to be accomplished. As long as we sail with the
                     current of the world we need neither canvas nor oar. It is when
                     we turn squarely about to stem the current that our labors
                     begin."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 129.

                                                                      March 14
          Part 4     "I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world,
    THE CHURCH     but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil" (John 17:15).
 AND THE WORLD
                      Christians have had a tendency to run away from the world.
                   But Jesus makes it clear that, although the Christian should
                   rightly fear certain elements in the world, he can serve a pur-
                   pose in the world which he cannot accomplish by being out of it.

                    What should the Christian seek to do while he is in the
                   world? Matt. 5:13-16.

                     The Christian is to be in the world in the sense that he makes a
                   contribution to righteousness and proper behavior; but he is
                   not of it, because he cannot associate with evildoers in their
                   sinful practices.

                     What is one way in which the Christian can avoid being
                   associated with the world? 2 Cor. 6:14.

                     The Christian must seek that kind of occupation in which he is
                   not involved in partnerships that could be embarrassing to his
                   Christian principles. In the world there are shady practices,
                   unjust dealings, unfair representation, even outright lying.
                   Since the Christian can have nothing to do with these things, he
                   has no option but to separate himself from any activity that
                   involves such a policy. How can he, with a clear conscience,
                   profit from a business that deals with products that are un-
                   healthful? His objectives in life are not merely to gain a living, or
                   amass wealth, but to represent his Master.

                      What example did Jesus set of being in the world but not of
                   it? Acts 10:38.

                     When Jesus was condemned for eating with sinners He
                   pointed out that His mission was to bring sinners to repentance.
                   (See Matt. 9:10-13.)

THINK IT THROUGH     Why is it that the Christian is disliked even though he is
                   engaged in good works and stands for principles of right
                   conduct?

                      "The world loves sin, and hates righteousness, and this was
                   the cause of its hostility to Jesus. All who refuse His infinite love
                   will find Christianity a disturbing element. The light of Christ
                   sweeps away the darkness that covers their sins, and the need
                   of reform is made manifest. . . .
                      "Thus strife is created, and Christ's followers are accused as

            Part 5    "Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as
         THE FINAL a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour"
         STRUGGLE (1 Peter 5:8).

                        The closing scenes of earth's history will involve a bitter
                     struggle between the followers of Jesus on one hand and the
                     followers of the devil on the other. The devil knows that his time
                     is short, and he makes a supreme effort to deceive the elect so
                     that they will be destroyed. (See Matt. 24:24.)

                      In view of the bitterness of the final struggle, what are
                     Christians admonished to do? Matt. 24:42; 25:13.

                       There is one area in which we must be especially watchful:
                     "Satan will constantly present allurements to induce us to break
                     this tie [Christ's love]—to choose to separate ourselves from
                     Christ. Here is where we need to watch, to strive, to pray, that
                     nothing may entice us to choose another master; for we are
                     always free to do this."—Steps to Christ, p. 72.

                       What assurance for the final struggle can we gain from
                     Paul's remarks in Romans 8:35-39?

                        The truth of the gospel should be so firmly established in the
                     heart and mind that nothing can separate the Christian from his
                     Lord. Yet the devil will present himself as an angel of light, and
                     his teaching will be so specious that only those who have im-
                     mersed themselves in the truth will be able to distinguish be-
                     tween truth and error. As the day of Christ's coming approaches
                     let us study our Bibles to avoid being deceived by the devil.
                       There is a danger that we shall underestimate the power of the
                     evil one and become self-sufficient, relying on our own powers
                     to gain the victory. It is only as we recognize our weakness and
                     rely wholly on Christ that we can overcome.
                       Although the devil is a wily foe, he is a defeated one. "Through
                     divine strength the weakest saint is more than a match for him
                     and all his angels."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 293.

THINK IT THROUGH       What are some of the devil's tricks that we should be wary
                     of?

                        "The watchful Christian is a working Christian, seeking zeal-
                     ously to do all in his power for the advancement of the gospel.
                     As love for his Redeemer increases, so also does love for his
                     fellow men. He has severe trials, as had his Master; but he does
                     not allow affliction to sour his temper or destroy his peace of
                     mind. He knows that trial, if well borne, will refine and purify
                     him, and bring him into closer fellowship with Christ."—The

                                                                        March 16

      INVOLVED have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children,
                because ye have known the Father" (1 John 2:13).

                     John in his letter writes to everyone, because he knows that
                   everyone is involved in the struggle against evil. The old, the
                   young, and the very young—all have characteristics that are
                   important in the controversy.

                     Whom does the prophet Joel include in the preparation for a
                   time of emergency? Joel 1:14; 2:15-17, 28.

                      Sometimes the leaders are saddled with the responsibility of
                   doing everything for themselves and the people. But this situa-
                   tion is not biblical. All God's people have specific tasks, and
                   only as each one does what he can according to his talent can
                   every emergency be met and overcome.
                      There is no greater urgency than that of being ready for and
                   speeding the second advent. If Jesus' coming has been delayed,
                   this is no reason why believers should be lax. On the contrary, it
                   means that a Laodicean church needs to awake out of slumber,
                   and all see to it that the delay is not on their account.

                    What central theme do you find in the parable recorded in
                   Matthew 18:11-14?

                     It is very human to think that some people are more important
                   than others. And it is true that some people have more talents
                   than others. But everyone has at least one talent. The work is of
                   such a nature that every talent is needed, every person has a
                   part to play in the area where he finds himself. He cannot put his
                   duty on someone else.

THINK IT THROUGH     Why does God often choose the weak things of this world to
                   accomplish His purposes?

                     "Christ has given to the church a sacred charge. Every
                   member should be a channel through which God can com-
                   municate to the world the treasures of His grace, the u nsearch-
                   able riches of Christ. There is nothing that the Saviour desires
                   so much as agents who will represent to the world His Spirit and
                   His character. There is nothing the world needs so much as the
                   manifestation through humanity of the Saviour's love. All
                   heaven is waiting for men and women through whom God can
                   reveal the power of Christianity."—The Acts of the Apostles,

           OF FAITH
                        James seems to contradict Paul's emphasis on justification
                     by faith. In fact, Paul seems to depreciate the value of works.
                     (See Rom. 4:2.) As a result some scholars—even Luther
                     himself—have questioned the teaching of James. But a careful
                     study of both James and Paul will show that there is no con-
                     tradiction between the two.

                        What does James say about the place of faith in the life of
                      the Christian? James 2:22.

                        Faith is a basic attitude to God. (See Heb. 11:6.) All those in
                      the past and the present (and the future) who enter the kingdom
                      of heaven will do so because they were men of faith. But works
                      are a mirror that reflect faith, the evidence that faith exists.
                      Abraham had that kind of faith, and was justified.

                        What Is taught by James's illustration about the belief of
                      devils? James 2:19.

                        Many know the truth but do not live up to it. Some make
                     promises but never fulfill them. James points out that there
                     must be a close relationship between faith and works if faith is
                     to be meaningful and works valuable. He is not contrasting faith
                     and works, but rather two kinds of faith, one with works and the
                     other without. The first is living, the second dead.
                        If a man's works are divorced from his faith, the faith is
                     spurious. Or it is possible that he will try, without faith, to keep
                     the law in order to earn salvation. But this is legalistic and futile.
                     (See Gal. 3:11.) Only when a man's life of good works springs
                     from faith in God, a daily trusting and seeking to know His will,
                     can that life be a beautiful and glorious and working expression
                     of what it means to be saved. It is to be hoped that every
                     Christian, even as was his Master, is rich in such good works.

THINK IT THROUGH       What are the motives behind my actions? Am I kind and
                     loving because I want to project an image of being good? Do I
                     do some things because I do not want to show a lack of
                     Christian commitment?

                        "It is not the great results we attain, but the motives from
                     which we act, that weigh with God. He prizes goodness and
                     faithfulness more than the greatness of the work accom-
                     plished."—Testimonies, vol. 2, pp. 510, 511.
                        "Every follower of Christ should daily examine himself, that
                     he may become perfectly acquainted with his own conduct"—

Rich in Good Works         LESSON 12                                   ❑ Monday
                                                                        March 19
           Part 2   "He sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them, If
      GREATNESS any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all, and
      IN SERVICE  servant of all" (Mark 9:35).

                     The principles of Christ's kingdom are the exact opposite of
                   those in the world. People on the whole want to be served rather
                   than to serve. They would rather give orders than receive them.

                     What contrast did Jesus make between leaders in the
                   church and leaders in the world? Matt. 20:25-28.

                      The Christian must reject the idea of grasping authority. He
                   seeks to follow in the footsteps of his Master. He finds greatest
                   joy and fulfillment in service. In everything that he does,
                   whether he is choosing an occupation and training for it, or
                   actually following a vocation in life, he has in mind that he will
                   be helpful to others.
                     It takes the grace of God to have such an objective. All around
                   us are those who have selfish motives. Some have these selfish
                   motives even in spiritual matters. Some are busy with church
                   affairs because they seek self-gratification. This kind of activity
                   is no whit different from the life of the Pharisees. It causes
                   people to misinterpret Scriptures and fail to understand the
                   teachings of the gospel, even as people did in the time of Jesus.
                   Just as Jesus rejected Pharisaism, so today the Christian must
                   turn away from all self-seeking and hypocrisy. But this is possi-
                   ble only through the power of God.

                     To what extent did Jesus serve humanity? Matt. 20:28.

                      Jesus set out to do the Father's will. (See John 4:34.) In doing
                   this he was best meeting the needs of men. Here is a clue to our
                   finding true greatness in service. It is not when we go out with a
                   conscious effort to serve that we render the best service; but it is
                   when we ask God to lead and to guide, and when we ask for
                   grace to follow in His leading, that our lives can be truly great
                   because they are found in the furrow of the world's greatest
                   needs.

THINK IT THROUGH     How would you show that the life of service is a life of joy and
                   satisfaction? Why Is the life of service linked to true great-
                   ness?

                     "Those who are the partakers of the grace of Christ will be
                   ready to make any sacrifice, that others for whom He died may
                   share the heavenly gift. They will do all they can to make the
                   world better for their stay in it."—Steps to Christ, p. 78.

Rich in Good Works           LESSON 12                                ❑ Tuesday
                                                                       March 20
            Part 3  "For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every
         STANDARD secret thing, whether it be good, or whether It be evil" (Eccl.
      OF JUDGMENT 12:14).
                       It can be frightening to know that everything we do will come
                     up in the judgment and that we shall be held accountable for our
                     actions, whether they be open or secret, good or bad.

                       How did Jesus describe the process of judgment? Matt.
                     25:31-46.
                        The Christian does service for Christ when he aids human
                     need. Christ's words to "sheep" and "goats" show that Christ
                     so identifies Himself with people that He considers deeds done
                     to them as done to Himself. Do we make that equation?
                        One of the lessons of this passage is that no true Christian
                     would ever dream of not meeting a need of Christ if He should
                     present Himself. The Christian should see in every person Christ
                     Himself asking for help. Is this the way we see appeals that are
                     made to us, or are we only conscious of the human element? Do
                     we tire of appeals because we think they have human origin?
                       It is remarkable that the "sheep" were not aware that they
                     were doing anything for the Master when they were meeting the
                     needs of "one of the least" of their fellowmen. What does this
                     tell you? Does it mean that the Christian meets a need on the
                     basis of need, without regard to the "quality" of the person
                     being helped? Does the expression, "one of the least," suggest
                     someone who does not deserve our help? Can it be that the
                     Christian is so full of good deeds that he cannot and does not
                     keep count of them, let alone remember them, or even think of
                     them as good deeds since they are so natural a part of his life?
                       The Bible makes it plain that everything is recorded in the
                     books of heaven, and people are held accountable for their
                     conduct. This should cause us to pause in all solemnity and ask
                     ourselves whether we shall be able to face the charges that can
                     be brought against us. Then we should confess our sins and ask
                     for grace so to live that we may more perfectly reflect the image
                     of Jesus who always went about doing good. We must not do
                     nothing; we must do something, constrained by the love of
                     Christ.

THINK IT THROUGH       Is God fair to bring every "work" into judgment? How can
                     one make sure that he will not be ashamed in the day that God
                     separates the "sheep" from the "goats"?
                      "God's love has been expressed in His justice no less than in
                    His mercy. Justice is the foundation of His throne, and the fruit
                    of His love. . . .

Rich in Good Works         LESSON 12                             ❑ Wednesday
                                                                    March 21
           Part 4   What kind of men were chosen to care for various aspects of
      ORGANIZED business in the early church?
      FOR NEEDS
                    "Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of
                  honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we
                  may appoint over this business" (Acts 6:3).

                     The early church soon found it necessary to organize itself for
                   the care of the needy in its midst. There can be no question
                   about the importance of welfare activity.
                     The church exists to provide for people's physical and
                   spiritual needs. Too often the emphasis is on the spiritual with-
                   out regard for the physical. But the two must go together; the
                   one without the other is unsatisfying and unbalanced.

                     What was one way that Jesus showed that He was in-
                   terested In the physical needs of the people with whom He
                   was associated? Matt. 14:16.

                     Unfortunately some people are interested only in what they
                   can put in their stomachs. Jesus met such people on the day
                   after the miracle of the loaves and the fishes and rebuked them
                   for their shortsighted interests. (See John 6:25-29.) The prime
                   objective of all missionary endeavor is that people come to
                   know God and believe on Him. (See verse 29.) But in this life
                   people have their very real physical needs, and it is idle to think
                   that the church and its leadership can neglect these needs.
                     It is noteworthy that the first deacons were men of spiritual
                   stature. We do not know much about some of them, but we do
                   know about Stephen and Philip, the one a martyr and the other
                   an evangelist with four daughters who prophesied. (See Acts
                   6:5, 8; 7:58; 8:5, 27; 21:8.) Any and all who take part in the
                   service of the church, whether it be preaching or caring for the
                   details of church management, must be men and women of
                   God. Only in this way can they provide for the whole needs of
                   man.

THINK IT THROUGH     How would you establish a balance between welfare work
                   for the community and evangelistic outreach? How could a
                   church fail by being engaged only in one phase or the other?

                      "The appointment of the seven to take the oversight of special
                   lines of work, proved a great blessing to the church. These
                   officers gave careful consideration to individual needs as well
                   as to the general financial interests of the church, and by their
                   prudent management and their godly example they were an
                   important aid to their fellow officers in binding together the
                   various interests of the church into a united whole."—The Acts

            Part 5    What persons does Isaiah mention as objects of aid in the
          MEETING true fast?
      EMERGENCIES
                      "Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of
                   wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the op-
                   pressed go free, and that ye break every yoke? Is it not to deal
                   thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are
                   cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou
                   cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own
                   flesh?" (Isa. 58:6, 7)
                       Ellen White urges that we ought to read Isaiah 58, and after
                     quoting a number of verses she says: "This is the special work
                     now before us."—Testimonies, vol. 2, pp. 33, 34.
                       Life has many emergency situations. They are often tragic but
                     they are also golden opportunities for someone to do good.
                       It is not always easy to ask for help. Some people would rather
                     suffer. But the Christian will make it his business to know the
                     needs of people in the area he lives in.

                       What lessons are there for us in the experience of Elijah and
                     the widow of Zarephath? 1 Kings 17:10-16.
                       "Angels are waiting to see if we embrace opportunities within
                     our reach of doing good—waiting to see if we will bless others,
                     that they in their turn may bless us. The Lord Himself has made
                     us to differ,—some poor, some rich, some afflicted,—that all
                     may have an opportunity to develop character. The poor are
                     purposely permitted to be thus of God, that we may be tested
                     and proved, and develop what is in our hearts."—Testimonies,
                     vol. 2, p. 28.

                       What does the story of Joseph teach about how to relate to
                     emergencies? Gen. 41:33-37.
                       Adequate preparation needs to be made for future needs and
                     for emergency situations. The individual and the church must
                     be ready to meet needs when they arise.
THINK IT THROUGH      Why are some people not ready to help in time of an
                     emergency? What blessing do they lose?
                       "From what has been shown me, Sabbath keepers are grow-
                     ing more selfish as they increase in riches. Their love for Christ
                     and His people is decreasing. They do not see the wants of the
                     needy, nor feel their sufferings and sorrows. They do not realize
                     that in neglecting the poor and the suffering they neglect Christ,
                     and that in relieving the wants and sufferings of the poor as far
                     as possible, they minister to Jesus."—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 24.

                                                                         March 23
         Part 6  "Whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones
        WORKS a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say
      REWARDED unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward" (Matt. 10:42).

                      Life may be hard, events may involve sacrifice, but the Chris-
                   tian has a future joy to which he can look. This will make the past
                   seem negligible as far as pain or suffering is concerned.

                    What did Jesus say was a Christian's cause for rejoicing?
                   Matt. 5:12.

                     No one suffers in the long run when he is faithful to God and
                   acts as a good steward. God pays good wages. The wages far
                   outweigh the services rendered. This is made clear by the para-
                   ble of the laborers in the vineyard. (See Matt. 20:1-16.)
                     Some people accuse the Christian of being one who is look-
                   ing forward to "pie in the sky." But the fact is that Christians
                   receive a reward right in this life for many of the things that they
                   do. Luke gives an interesting example of this in Luke 5:1-11. The
                   disciples had toiled all night fishing and gained nothing. Jesus
                   got into one of the boats in the morning and asked that He be
                   rowed a little distance from the shore so that He could use it to
                   speak to the people without having the people pressing around
                   Him. When Jesus completed His discourse, He told the fisher-
                   men to go out for a catch, which they did, and they received a
                   draught of fishes which more than compensated for Jesus' use
                   of the boat for a short period of time. It is no wonder that the
                   disciples decided that they would follow Jesus.

                     What did Jesus assure His disciples about a reward? Luke
                   18:30.
                     The Christian does not work for a reward, so that the reward is
                   in the nature of a bonus. But a reward is always pleasant to
                   receive! The Christian can rest assured that he is not wasting his
                   time, nor are his efforts unnoticed. He is working for a Lord and
                   Master who recognizes everyone's need and gives generously
                   out of His limitless bounties.

THINK IT THROUGH     Contrast the wages of sin with the gift of God. Why is God so
                   good a Master? What experiences have you had that show
                   that God is exceedingly generous with you?
                     "When Christ abides in the soul, the thought of reward is not
                   uppermost. This is not the motive that actuates our service....
                   God desires us to appreciate His promised blessings. But He
                   would not have us eager for rewards nor feel that for every duty
                   we must receive compensation."—Christ's Object Lessons,

       SALVATION and full of glory: receiving the end of your faith, even the
                 salvation of your souls" (1 Peter 1:8, 9).

                     Peter writes to "God's scattered people" (1 Peter 1:1, NEB)
                   that they have been born to an inheritance "that nothing can
                   destroy or spoil or wither. It is kept for you in heaven, and you,
                   because you put your faith in God, are under the protection of
                   his power until salvation comes" (verses 4, 5, NEB).

                     What does Peter say is the result of such an inheritance?
                   1 Peter 1:6.

                      What greater inheritance can one fall heir to than salvation?
                   We have a Saviour who can save "to the uttermost" (Heb. 7:25;
                   "save absolutely," NEB). We have a God who can and will keep
                   His promise. No wonder there is a superabounding joy in the
                   heart of the Christian even when he is passing through difficult
                   circumstances and may have a few trials to bear.
                     What strengthened Jesus so that He could endure the
                   cross? Heb. 12:2.
                       Jesus could see the future results of the present conflict. For
                   Him that future was everything. So it should be with the Chris-
                   tian.
                       But there should be joy in the present too. Have you met
                   those who are always complaining about their inadequacies
                   and mistreatment?
                       "Many, walking along the path of life, dwell upon their mis-
                   takes and failures and disappointments, and their hearts are
                   filled with grief and discouragement. . . .
                       "It is not wise to gather together all the unpleasant recollec-
                   tions of a past life,—its iniquities and disappointments,—to talk
                   over them and mourn over them until we are overwhelmed with
                   discouragement. A discouraged soul is filled with darkness,
                   shutting out the light of God from his own soul and casting a
                   shadow upon the pathway of others."—Steps to Christ, pp. 116,
                   117.
THINK IT THROUGH     Although Jesus was "a man of sorrows, and acquainted
                   with grief," how did His life affect others?

                      "Though His life was self-denying and shadowed with pain
                   and care, His spirit was not crushed. His countenance did not
                   wear an expression of grief and repining, but ever one of peace-
                   ful serenity. His heart was a wellspring of life, and wherever He
                   went He carried rest and peace, joy and gladness."—Steps to

Rejoicing in the Lord       LESSON 13                                 ❑  Monday
                                                                        March 26

     THE JOY OF    was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called
    GOD'S WORD     by thy name, 0 Lord God of hosts" (Jer. 15:16).

                     Jeremiah had a very hard time as a prophet. He saw the flower
                   of Judean youth taken captive by Nebuchadnezzar in 605 B.C.
                   He saw Jerusalem besieged in 597 B.C. and then the temple
                   destroyed in 586 B.C. His own countrymen refused to accept his
                   messages and looked upon him as a traitor. Yet he says he
                   found joy in the word that came to him from God.

                     What does the psalmist extol in Psalm 19:7, 8?

                      Do we recognize the value of the Bible? Do we find the truths
                   of God fascinating, enlightening, reviving? Do we find God's
                   words sweeter than honey and more precious than gold?
                      The Word of God is the word of life. It tells us where we came
                   from and where we are going. It explains life and the conflict
                   that we see between good and evil. The light shining from the
                   Word of God gives deep meaning to life.
                      Because of the revelation of God in His Word the Christian
                   can go on his way rejoicing. He can be an optimist because he
                   knows that truth will triumph in the end. Being on the side of
                   truth he has nothing to fear and everything to be happy about.

                     In John 15:11, what reason did Jesus give for the teachings
                   He had just imparted?

                     Jesus told His disciples that He treated them as friends, not as
                   servants, because He let them into all the secrets that the Father
                   had revealed to Him. (See John 15:15.) This grace whereby God
                   takes us into His council and treats us, not as we deserve, but as
                   He would have us to be, His sons and daughters, is a reason for
                   great rejoicing. We find ourselves lifted up to a position of
                   honor, and the least that we can do is to be appreciative and live
                   up to our privileges.

THINK IT THROUGH     How does one discover the sweetness of the Word of God?

                     "When a real love for the Bible is awakened, and the student
                   begins to realize how vast is the field and how precious its
                   treasure, he will desire to seize upon every opportunity for
                   acquainting himself with God's word. Its study will be restricted
                   to no special time or place. And this continuous study is one of
                   the best means of cultivating a love for the Scriptures.
                     " ... Let the youth of today, the youth who are growing up with
                   the Bible in their hands, become the recipients and the chan-
                   nels of its life-giving energy, and what streams of blessing
                   would flow forth to the world!"—Education, pp. 191, 192.

      THE ABUNDANT
               LIFE      Fullness of life is another blessing the Christian can enjoy.
                       Being born again, he is free from the bondage of sin, from the
                       shackles of a lower nature that drags him down to despair.

                         What does Paul say is the result of being in Christ? 2 Cor.
                       5:17.
                           We all know the experience of having something new. We
                       delight in its newness, its beauty, its efficiency, its charm. Life is
                       lifted to a new level of enjoyment when we have new things
                       around us. God will make all things new. That is a time we can all
                       anticipate with joy. But the joys are not all future; even in this life
                       we can enter into the joy of being a new creation.
                          Ellen White wrote: "The Lord desires us to appreciate the
                       great plan of redemption, to realize our high privilege as the
                       children of God, and to walk before Him in obedience, with
                       grateful thanksgiving. He desires us to serve Him in newness of
                       life, with gladness every day. He longs to see gratitude welling
                       up in our hearts because our names are written in the Lamb's
                       book of life, because we may cast all our care upon Him who
                       cares for us. He bids us rejoice because we are the heritage of
                       the Lord."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 299.

                         How did the Ethiopian eunuch respond after he had been

                       8:39.
                          There is great pleasure in following in the Master's footsteps.
                       When we can see the truth plainly and we do what we know is
                       right, then there is peace and joy.

                         What picture do we get of the city of Samaria after Philip had
                       been there and preached Christ? Acts 8:8.
                         "Joy in the Holy Spirit is health-giving, life-giving joy. In giving
                       us His Spirit, God gives us Himself, making Himself a fountain of

                   10:17.
                      Jesus warned His disciples that they would suffer persecution
                   when they witnessed to the truth, but the fact is that not
                   everyone suffers persecution. Some Christians wonder whether
                   there is anything the matter with them when they are not being
                   persecuted. Some have a persecution complex and like to invite
                   trouble for themselves. Should the Christian be concerned
                   about persecution?
                      If persecution does not come, then we can rejoice that we are
                   free from trials and hardship, unless it is that we are being left
                   alone because we are doing no good!
                      If persecution comes, then we can rejoice as did the apostles
                   that we have been counted worthy to suffer indignity for our
                   Master's name. In either case we rejoice. "God in His great love
                   is seeking to develop in us the precious graces of His Spirit. He
                   permits us to encounter obstacles, persecution, and hardships,
                   not as a curse, but as the greatest blessing of our lives."—
                   Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 117.
                      Persecution in the past gave the early church an impetus to
                   carry the gospel to the world. Persecution in the future will help
                   distinguish the real Christian from the false. The true Christian
                   rejoices that he can have a part. in the controversy between
                   good and evil, and he prays that he may be a good soldier of
                   Jesus Christ who knows how to take battle wounds and rejoices
                   in the battles gained.

THINK IT THROUGH     What is the secret of rejoicing even in the most trying cir-
                   cumstances?
                     "So long as we do not consent to sin, there is no power,
                   whether human or satanic, that can bring a stain upon the soul.
                   A man whose heart is stayed upon God is just the same in the
                   hour of his most afflicting trials and most discouraging sur-
                   roundings as when he was in prosperity, when the light and
                   favor of God seemed to be upon him."—Thoughts From the

           Part 5  "How can we thank God enough for you, for all the joy we
       THE JOY OF feel before our God on your account?" (1 Thess. 3:9,
      FELLOWSHIP Jerusalem)
                     There can be no communion between light and darkness.
                   (See 2 Cor. 6:14.) But the fellowship of believers has common
                   objectives and interests, and this association with others brings
                   the Christian great joy.
                     In the parables of Luke 15 what can we learn about joy? (See
                   verses 6, 9, 32.)
                     "Never think that you can be Christians and yet withdraw
                   yourselves within yourselves. Each one is a part of the great web
                   of humanity, and the experience of each will be largely deter-
                   mined by the experience of his associates. . . .
                       . . . Fellowship with one another should make us glad."—
                   Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 362.

                     (See Acts 2:42.)
                      No one denies the importance of right teaching in the church
                   or of prayer and "breaking of bread." But apparently there is
                   something else that is equally important—fellowship.
                      "After the descent of the Holy Spirit the disciples went forth to
                   proclaim a risen Saviour—their one desire, the salvation of
                   souls. They rejoiced in the sweetness of the communion with
                   saints. They were tender, thoughtful, self-denying, willing to
                   make any sacrifice for the truth's sake. In their daily association
                   with one another they revealed the love that Christ had com-
                   manded them to reveal. By unselfish words and deeds they
                   strove to kindle this love in other hearts."—Testimonies, vol. 8,
                   p. 241.

                     What was Paul's attitude when he prayed for the Philip-
                   pians? Phil. 1:3-5.
                     Fellowship basically means partnership. Paul was delighted
                   that the members of the Philippian church had responded in
                   sharing with him the work of the gospel. Christians are drawn
                   closer to Christ and to one another when they are engaged in
                   gospel service.

THINK IT THROUGH     What is a solution to the feeling of loneliness? How can the
                   church meet the needs of the lonely and withdrawn?
                      "Many are suffering from maladies of the soul far more than
                   from diseases of the body, and they will find no relief until they
                   shall come to Christ, the wellspring of life.... Satisfying joys will
                   give vigor to the mind and health and vital energy to the
                   body."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 579.

          Part 6    "Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing
     THE JOY OF of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ" (Titus 2:13).
       CHRIST'S
        RETURN      The Christian has many reasons for rejoicing, but perhaps the
                 most exciting is what Paul calls the "blessed hope."
                    Two men dressed in white stood by the disciples who were
                 gazing into heaven. Jesus slowly ascended from their sight. The
                 two, who were angels, announced that Jesus would come again
                 "in like manner." Ever since that moment the church has looked
                 forward to the second advent. His coming continues to be the
                 living hope of many Christians today.

                     What does Paul say Christians do as they hold hope? Rom.
                   12:12.
                     The second coming of Jesus puts an end to all separation.
                   Disciples are united with their Master. The righteous dead are
                   brought to life and meet their loved ones. This mortal puts on
                   incorruption. (See 1 Cor. 15:53.) There is no more sighing, no
                   more pain. There can only be joy forevermore. This is the hope
                   of all hopes, the glorious climax of over six thousand years of
                   struggle. It is no wonder that Christians look forward to this
                   event as the solution to all the problems of the world.

                     What advice does James give in relation to the second
                   advent? James 5:7, 8.
                     There may be the danger that some will lose patience because
                   of apparent delay. But everything, even delays, can be a part of
                   God's providence. We should not question God's timing. (See
                   Acts 1:7.) We must rest assured in God's promises, and by faith
                   rejoice in His future coming as though it were a part of today's
                   happening. Just as the child jumps with glee when the parent
                   promises a gift to be given on a birthday or at Christmastime, so
                   the Christian looks forward to a future event with present joy,
                   knowing that God's promises are sure. (Read Heb. 10:35-39.)

THINK IT THROUGH     How can so-called delays in the second coming turn out to
                   be blessings?
                     "Every step in life may bring us closer to Jesus, may give us a
                   deeper experience of His love, and may bring us one step nearer
                   to the blessed home of peace. Then let us not cast away our
                   confidence, but have firm assurance, firmer than ever before."
                   —Steps to Christ, p. 125.
                     "God wants you to work, not with self-disparagement nor in
                   discouragement, but with the strongest faith and hope, with
                   cheerfulness and joy, representing Christ to the world. The
                   religion of Jesus is joy, peace, and happiness."—Testimonies,
