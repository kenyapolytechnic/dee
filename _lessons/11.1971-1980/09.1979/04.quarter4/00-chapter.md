Dear Sabbath School Brothers and Sisters,

In the name of the Euro-Africa Division, may I thank each one of you for your
generous third quarter, 1977, Thirteenth Sabbath Offering.

Once again it is the privilege of our division to receive financial help from
the worldwide Sabbath School family in developing projects which will advance
the work of God. The Special Projects Offering for this quarter will reflect
a lot of prayer, work, and sacrifice by God's people around the world. Your
gifts will go for the following projects:

1. COMPLETION OF ANDAPA HOSPITAL IN MADAGASCAR

Located in the northeast part of Madagascar, this mission hospital began
operating two years ago. The construction of the 40-bed hospital has already
been started. However, much of the technical apparatus and medical equipment
still needs to be financed. Soon a second physician will be employed to give
medical assistance to the sick in the outlying areas of the island.

2. EVANGELISTIC CENTER IN N'DJAMENA, CHAD

Elder Albert Bodenmann, a Swiss missionary, pioneered our work to Chad in 1968.
During the past 11 years small groups of Adventists have been meeting regularly
throughout the country. One of our greatest needs in this field is for an
evangelistic center in the country's capital, N'Djamena. For many years the
two congregations there have had to meet in small chapels built of clay. This
situation is no little hindrance in our evangelistic efforts. Now a part of
your offerings will fulfill this real need.

3. DORMITORIES FOR PORTO ACADEMY, PORTO, PORTUGAL

In the last few years our work in Portugal has developed strongly. Doors have
suddenly opened for our educational work there. Our school in Porto needs girls'
and boys' dormitories enabling Adventist parents to send their children to our
school.

We look forward to the end of this quarter with confidence and trust, knowing
that through the work of the Holy Spirit and through brotherly cooperation, we
will be able to promote and strengthen and complete God's work. Your offerings
on this 13th Sabbath will contribute to this.

Again, thank you for your help. In the unity of God's family, I remain


Your brother in Christ,



E. Ludescher, president

                      OUR WONDERFUL GOD
                                      INTRODUCTION


    God is the outstanding fact of the universe. Man's greatest need is to understand
Him better.and to have God'simage restored in him. Without such an understanding
it is not possible for man to be truly happy or to be at peace with himself or his fellows.
Because men failed to understand God and because they failed to recognize Him and
give Him the homage that is His due, humanity has brought woe upon itself and doom
upon the world.
    In the Bible God has given a revelation of Himself through His witnesses—the
patriarchs, the prophets, and the apostles. And in these last days we are particularly
favored by the marvelous revelation that God has given of Himself through His
chosen messenger, Ellen G. White. But the most outstanding revelation the world has
had of God is through His Son, Jesus Christ, who came to this earth to live the life of
God in human flesh and to give God's message to men through human' lips.
    When man becomes acquainted with God, he discovers that He is indeed a wonder-
ful God—a God of goodness as well as greatness, of love as well as wisdom, of mercy
as well as justice, of compassion as well as power. He is the God of the poor and meek
of earth as well as of the wealthy and the great, a God of men of all colors and races
who stand before Him as equals and are equally loved by Him. This wonderful God is
our God today, the God of yesterday as well as tomorrow.
    The purpose of the lessons this quarter is to help us become better acquainted with
our wonderful God and to serve Him better. Thus in this earth we may learn to become
like Him, and fit and privileged to become His closest associates throughout eternity.
    The Bible and the spirit of prophecy will be our main sources for detailed informa-
tion concerning our wonderful God. The title of each lesson is a biblical,name for
God.
    The men who wrote the books of the Bible were men who were acquainted with
God and who were spokesmen for Him. They heard God, they talked to Him and
 walked with Him, and made Him known to those about them.
    In our age God had a special messenger to whom He revealed Himself and through
 whom He spoke to man. As a result we may have modern conceptions of God
 concerning our own ways and the times in which we live, expressed in the language
 of today. In the writings of Ellen G. White, termed "the spirit of prophecy," we
 constantly come into touch with God. To what extent this is true may be seen by a
 glance at the Comprehensive Index to the Writings of Ellen G. White. There, under the
 heading "God," are found 20 pages of references with about 70 entries per page.
 Under the heading "Christ" 86 pages of references occur, and under the heading
"Holy Spirit," there are 30 pages. Anyone who desires to become acquainted with
modern revelations concerning God and His ways dares not ignore this source. It will
 constantly be employed in these lessons.

                                                                      September 30
          Part 1  What does the psalmist, in Psalm 90:1, 2, emphasize about
 THE ETERNAL GOD God?

                       "Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.
                     Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst
                     formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to
                     everlasting, thou art God" (Ps. 90:1, 2).

                        In this psalm, Moses presents an impressive picture of the
                     transitoriness of man's existence in contrast with the eternity of
                     God. The life of man is limited. He comes and goes like the
                     grass; he spends his years as a tale that is told, but God abides
                     forever. Notice the striking affirmations of the timelessness of
                     God in Psalm 90:1, 2, 4.

                       How does John the revelator refer to the length of Christ's
                     reign? Rev. 11:15.

                       The kingdom will have no end. In this regard it differs from all
                     earthly kingdoms. Our God will reign without ceasing.

                       How does Daniel envision the kingdom set up by God? Dan.
                     2:44.
                       Only one kingdom can last forever and that is God's kingdom
                     because only God can continue ruling forever.

                       What does Paul say concerning God's being? 1 Tim. 6:16.

                        Paul places before Timothy the challenge to remain true to
                     God, fighting the good fight of faith (1 Tim. 6:12). He is to do this
                     in the sight of God who is to be honored forever and ever, who
                     alone has immortality. Timothy is not serving one who is here
                     today and gone tomorrow. There is stability in eternity.

 THINK IT THROUGH      Why is the eternity of the Godhead an important charac-
                     teristic?

                        The eternity of God means the eternity of His principles of
                     righteousness and peace. When we make the eternal God our
                     habitation, we may be sure that we can never be moved. Change
                     and decay are characteristics of everything around us, but God
                     never changes. When God abides with us, we can abide in Him
                     forever.
                        "I AM means an eternal presence; the past, present, and
                     future are alike to God. He sees the most remote events of past
                     history, and the far distant future with as clear a vision as we do
                     those things that are transpiring daily."—Ellen G. White Com-

The Ancient of Days         LESSON 1                                   ❑ Monday
                                                                       October 1
            Part 2     How does the one true God point out His uniqueness?
     THE ONLY GOD
                       "Thus saith the Lord the King of Israel, and his redeemer the
                     Lord of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me
                     there is no God. And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare It,
                     and set it in order for me, since I appointed the ancient
                     people? and the things that are coming, and shall come, let
                     them shew unto them. Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have not I
                     told thee from that time, and have declared It? ye are even my
                     witnesses. Is there a God beside me? yea, there is no God; I
                     know not any" (Isa. 44:6-8).

                       The Bible makes it clear that there is only one God—the God
                     who created man and who is thesupreme Ruler of heaven and
                     earth. That the Lord is the only true God is emphasized
                     throughout God's Word.

                      What other texts in Scripture describe the uniqueness of
                     God? Isa. 45:5; 43:10; 1 Cor. 8:6; Ps. 86:10.

                       From earth's earliest ages after the Fall men have worshiped
                     gods other than the Lord who rules the heavens and the earth.
                     The Babylonians, Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans invented
                     such gods and erected temples to them. But they were gods
                     without power or authority, and were no more worthy of wor-
                     ship or respect than the wood or stone of which they were made.

                       What is the first commandment of the law of God? Ex. 20:3.

                       "Jehovah, the eternal, self-existent, uncreated One, Himself
                     the Source and Sustainer of all, is alone entitled to supreme
                     reverence and worship. Man is forbidden to give to any other
                     object the first place in his affections or his service. Whatever
                     we cherish that tends to lessen our love for God or to interfere
                     with the service due Him, of that do we make a god."—

 THINK IT THROUGH      Why have men turned away from the true God to worship the
                     false gods?

                       "Satan accomplished the fall of man, and since that time it
                     has been his work to efface in man the image of God, and to
                     stamp upon human hearts his own image. Possessing su-
                     premacy in guilt, he claims supremacy for himself, and exer-
                     cises over his subjects the power of royalty. He cannot expel
                     God from His throne, but through the system of idolatry, he
                     plants his own throne between the heaven and the earth, be-
                     tween God and the human worshiper."—Ellen G. White Com-

            Part 3     Is it inevitable that God's purposes will be worked out?
THE UNIVERSAL GOD
                        "This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth:
                     and this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations.
                     For the Lord of hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul
                     it? and his hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back?"
                     (Isa. 14:26, 27).

                       The Creator of the universe is its lawful Lord, and the maker of
                     the world is its rightful King. God is everywhere in supreme
                     command. (See Col. 1;16, 17.)

                      Does anything happen in the world that God is unaware of?
                     Matt. 6:26-32.
                       "Nothing can happen in any part of the universe without the
                     knowledge of Him who is omnipresent."—Ellen G. White Com-

                       "The same creative energy that brought the world into exis-
                     tence is still exerted in upholding the universe and continuing
                     the operations of nature. The hand of God guides the planets in

                       What striking contrast does Isaiah make between God and
                     His creation? Isa. 40:15, 17.
                        It is comforting to know that the Supreme Ruler above is the
                     Friend of man. Human beings everywhere are objects of His
                     saving grace. "God is no respecter of persons: but in every
                     nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is ac-
                     cepted with him" (Acts 10:34, 35).
                        "The life of Christ established a religion in which there is no
                     caste, a religion by which Jew and Gentile, free and bond, are
                     linked in a common brotherhood, equal before God."—Testi-

                       Rahab the innkeeper of Jericho (Joshua 2:3, 11), Naaman the
                     Syrian commander (2 Kings 5:9, 15), Nebuchadnezzar the
                     Babylonian king (Dan. 2:47), Cornelius the Roman centurion
                     (Acts 10:1, 2), the Roman centurion at the cross (Luke 23:46, 47),

                     the fact that evil is rampant in the world?

                                                                     October 3
            Part 4     Besides His eternity and uniqueness, what other charac-
   THE LIVING GOD    teristic does God have?

                       "The Lord is the true God, he is the living God, and an
                     everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the
                     nations shall not be able to abide his indignation. Thus shall
                     ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens
                     and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth, and from
                     under these heavens" (Jer. 10:10, 11).

                       The living God of the Hebrews is set forth in striking contrast
                     to the man-made gods of the heathen which have no life. (See
                     1 Sam. 17:36; 1 Kings 18:26-29; 1 Thess. 1:9.)
                       The term "living God" means more than that God is alive. It
                     also means that God gives life. That is why the psalmist says:
                     "With my whole being I thirst for God, the living God" (Ps. 42:2,
                     NEB). (See also Ps. 63:1.) The psalmist knows that, as the
                     parched animal drinks water and is refreshed, so we can come
                     to the living God and receive renewed energies.
                        There is also the connotation of watching and caring and
                     acting, something a living God could do but the idols never. We
                     may be thankful that we have a living God who can be trusted to
                     care for our every need.

                       By what name did God reveal Himself to Moses? Ex. 3:14.

                       The four Hebrew letters composing this name have no related
                     vowels. Some have pronounced them Jehovah or Yahweh. The
                     devout Jew considers the name too sacred to pronounce. The
                     name suggests that God is the ever-present, ever-active God,
                     the One who is ready to help when the need arises.

                       With whom did Peter link Jesus? Matt. 16:16.

                     • Jesus claimed that He is the Life-giver. (See John 6:47; 10:10.)
                     He is the bread of life (John 6:51). He is the door and the
                     shepherd (John 10:9, 14).

 THINK IT THROUGH      If the words of Christ are eternal life, what should I do about
                     them?

                        "It was Christ who from the bush on Mount Horeb spoke to
                     Moses saying, 'I AM THAT I AM.... Thus shalt thou say unto the
                     children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.' Ex. 3:14. This was
                     the pledge of Israel's deliverance. So when He came 'in the
                     likeness of men,' he declared Himself the I AM. The Child of
                     Bethlehem, the meek and lowly Saviour, is God 'manifest in the
                     flesh,' 1 Tim. 3:16. And to us He says: 'I AM the Good Shepherd.'
                     'I AM the living Bread.' I AM the Way, the Truth, and the
                     Life.' "—The Desire of Ages, p. 24.

The Ancient of Days          LESSON 1                                   ❑ Thursday
                                                                         October 4
               Part 5 What attribute of God is expressed in Psalm 139:7-10?
     THE OMNIPRESENT
                 GOD   "Whither shall I go from thy Spirit?
                          Or whither shall I flee from thy presence?
                       If I ascend to heaven, thou art there!
                          If I make my bed in Sheol, thou art there!
                       If I take the wings of the morning
                          and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,
                       even there thy hand shall lead me,
                          and thy right hand shall hold me" (Ps. 139:7-10, RSV).

                        God is everywhere. There is no place where man may flee
                     from His presence, nowhere that His power is not at work, in the
                     highest heavens or in the deepest parts of the earth.
                        By the omnipresence of God we mean that God is not limited
                     by space as we are. We can be in only one place at a time, but He
                     can be everywhere at the same time. It is not that He spreads
                     Himself out everywhere—as the pantheist would suppose—but
                     He is wholly present everywhere. This concept is beyond our
                     comprehension, but so is everything else about God!
                        God has given abundant assurance in His Word that He is ever
                     present with His children. To His followers Jesus said, "Lo, I am
                     with you alway, even unto the end of the world" (Matt. 28:20).
                     Through His prophet Isaiah God spoke words of courage, "Fear
                     thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I
                     will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee
                     with the right hand of my righteousness" (Isa. 41:10). In the final
                     crisis God's people will be able to say, "The Lord of hosts is with
                     us; the God of Jacob is our refuge" (Ps. 46:7).

                       What desire did God express to Israel through Moses in
                     Exodus 25:8?

                       The church building today has, in some ways, taken the place
                     of the tabernacle of Old Testament times. There the Lord meets
                     with His people. There we can meet with Him and hear His voice
                     speaking to our hearts. God can be to us more than mere theory.
                     Wherever we may be, walking and talking with Him can be a
                     matter of personal experience. With my spiritual ear I personally
                     can hear God speaking to me, telling me that He loves me and is
                     with me, directing my ways, and speaking confidence and joy to
                     my heart. When Jesus returns in glory, I can be with those who
                     say, "Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will
                     save us: this is the Lord; we have waited for him, we will be glad
                     and rejoice in his salvation" (Isa. 25:9).

                                                                       October 5
           Part 6     What was David's concept of God?
   THE GREATNESS
          OF GOD      "Declare his glory among the heathen; his marvellous
                    works among all nations. For great is the Lord, and greatly to
                    be praised: he also is to be feared above all gods" (1 Chron.
                    16:24, 25).

                      Men of God have been deeply moved as they have pondered
                    His greatness and goodness. The greatest stars are the prod-
                    ucts of His hands. The mightiest angels were made by Him. All
                    the creatures of earth exist because of Him.

                      What are some of the ways in which we can see God's
                    greatness?

                       1. God's goodness—Ps. 31:19.
                       2. God's works—Ps. 92:5.
                       3. God's thoughts—Ps. 139:17.
                       4. God's personal care-1 Sam. 12:24.
                       God intends that we should think often of Him and of His
                    wonderful works. Doing so, we would approach Him with fitting
                    awe, respect, and acclaim. "Praise ye the Lord. I will praise the
                    Lord with my whole heart, in the assembly of the upright, and in
                    the congregation. The works of the Lord are great, sought out of
                    all them that have pleasure therein. . . . He hath made his
                    wonderful works to be remembered: the Lord is gracious and
                    full of compassion"(Ps. 111:1-4).
                       God is great in all His attributes—in His love and power, His
                    gentleness and mercy, His justice and goodness. Everything
                    about Him can be expressed in superlatives. His goodness
                    makes Him great.
                       The greatness of God makes men meek and reverent in His
                    presence. "True reverence for God is inspired by a sense of His
                    infinite greatness and a realization of His presence.... The hour
                    and place of prayer are sacred, because God is there."—
                    Prophets and Kings, pp. 48, 49.
                       The greatness of God inspires His children to strive toward
                     greater heights of attainment. "Be ye therefore perfect, even as
                    your Father which is in heaven is perfect" (Matt. 5:48). As God is
                     perfect in character, so man should be perfect in his. As God is
                     perfect in His workmanship, so man should put forth every
                     effort to be perfect in his. "As God is perfect in His sphere of
                     action, so man may be perfect in his human sphere."—Coun-
                    sels to Teachers, p. 365.

              Part 1     What portion of God's creation acknowledges God as ruler
       THE SUPREME     of all?
             RULER
             OF ALL      "Every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and
                       under the earth, and such as are In the sea, and all that are in
                       them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and

                       Lamb for ever and ever" (Rev. 5:13).

                          The Bible makes it clear that God is the one Supreme Ruler of
                       this world and all the universe. It is He who rules in the heavens,
                       and it is He who is sovereign over the earth.

                         What position does David attribute to God? What posses-
                       sions? 1 Chron. 29:10, 11.

                          These words of David are part of a prayer he offered at the
                       time that he presented to his son Solomon the plans for a temple
                       in Jerusalem. David had indicated what he had prepared for the
                       temple and what he had given, and he called upon the people
                       also to be generous with their offerings. This they were; and
                       every one was happy at the results (verse 9). This prayer is one of
                       the most beautiful in the Old Testament, and it represents how
                       devout people feel when they stand in the presence of God.
                       Words are hardly adequate to express all the supreme qualities
                       that God possesses.

                         By contrast, how does David portray himself and his
                       people? 1 Chron. 29:14-19.

                         Man has nothing in himself, but in God he has everything! Yet
                       he has one obligation, to keep God's commandments and stat-
                       utes (verse 19). The Supreme Ruler is the Supreme Benefactor if
                       we are faithful to Him.

                        What control does Daniel say that God has over rulers in this
                       world? Dan. 4:17.

                         Although the world is in rebellion against God, the time is
                       coming when the forces of evil will be overthrown and God will
                       take complete control. (See Rev. 11:15.)

                         What will Jesus do when He returns as King? Matt. 25:31-34.

 THINK IT THROUGH        If God is the Supreme Ruler of the world, why does He permit
                       so much misery and injustice?

The Lord Most High         LESSON 2                                  ❑ Monday
                                                                      October 8
           Part 2     According to Paul how complete is God's creation?
    THE CREATOR
          OF ALL      "By him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that
                    are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or
                    dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were
                    created by him, and for him: and he is before all things, and by
                    him all things consist" (Col. 1;16, 17).

                      Paul excludes nothing from God's creation. It includes
                    heaven and earth; it may or may not be visible; it may be any
                    order of supernatural being included under such terms as
                    "thrones" or "principalities." Then he points out that Creation
                    was accomplished through Christ and for Him. That is, Christ is
                    the agent of Creation and its goal. (See John 1:3.) Furthermore
                    Christ is the One in whom all things are held together. There
                    could hardly be any stronger statement to indicate the com-
                    prehensiveness of Creation and its total dependence upon Him.
                    Here is a doctrine by which to test all theories of origin, all
                    philosophies of existence.

                      How does nature testify to its Creator? Ps. 19:1-6.

                      Only a being of infinite wisdom, power, and love could have
                    brought the world into being. God's works testify of this. In the
                    sunset, the snowflake, the rose, we can see His sense of beauty.
                    In the mountains that tower above, the abyss that yawns be-
                    neath, the seas that circle the globe, and the stars in their
                    circuits through limitless space, we can see something of God's
                    infinite power.

                      On what basis should man reflect his Creator? Gen. 1:26, 27.

                      Man himself provides the most telling picture of the Creator.
                    The wisdom and love of man reflect the wisdom and love of God.
                    Man's physical form in some small way reflects something of
                    the form of God. Mar's sense of justice, mercy, and truth par-
                    takes of the matchless and holy character of God.
                      But also in man may be seen the evil image of the enemy who
                    has sought to destroy in man the image of God. The greatest
                    work of the Creator is that of restoring man to His own image.
                    (See 1 John 3:2.)

 THINK IT THROUGH     How can man express gratefulness to his Creator?

                      "Man was to bear God's image, both in outward resemblance
                    and in character.... His nature was in harmony with the will of
                    God.... He was holy and happy in bearing the image of God and
                    in perfect obedience to His will."—Patriarchs and Prophets,

                Part 3      In what respects may God be declared to be infinite?
     THE INFINITE GOD
                           "Great is our Lord, and of great power: his understanding is
                         infinite" (Ps. 147:5).

                           "0 the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowl-
                         edge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his
                         ways past finding out! For who hath known the mind of the
                         Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?" (Rom. 11:33, 34).

                            Since man is finite, he cannot grasp the meaning of infinity.
                         But he can begin to feel its magnitude when he thinks of all the
                         knowledge in the world, both past and present, and recognizes
                         that God has comprehended it all. We bow today before the
                         superior knowledge of authorities in fields of learning, but God
                         is the authority of authorities. When we think of how narrow a
                         field is included in the expertise of the expert, and how vast the
                         area of possible exploration, then we begin to marvel at a God
                         who has the expertise of an innumerable number of experts,
                         and that there is no area of which He is not an expert. In
                         speaking this way we are but using human terms. God's knowl-
                         edge is infinite, and we cannot but bow before such a God in
                         utter humility.

                           How does this Infinite God relate to you and me? Jer. 31:3.

                            However complex our problem may be, God can unravel it.
                         However difficult I may be to understand, God can enter into the
                         deepest recesses of my mind and appreciate every nuance of
                         my thinking and feeling. There is nothing too difficult for Him.
                         And since He loves us with an everlasting, unfathomable love,
                         we can commit our ways to Him with absolute confidence that
                         he will work everything out for our best interests.
                            "If you come to God, feeling helpless and dependent, as you
                         really are, and in humble, trusting prayer make your wants
                         known to Him whose knowledge is infinite, who sees everything
                         in creation and who governs everything by His will and word, He
                         can and will attend to your cry, and will let light shine into your
                         heart and all around you; for through sincere prayer your soul is
                         brought into connection with the mind of the Infinite."—

The Lord Most High         LESSON 2                               ❑ Wednesday
                                                                    October 10
           Part 4    What manifestations of God's power does Paul state in
THE ALL-POWERFUL    Ephesians 1:19-21?
             GOD
                      "What is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward
                    who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,
                    which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead,
                    and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, far
                    above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion,
                    and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also
                    in that which is to come" (Eph. 1:19-21).

                      Note that God manifests His power to "us-ward," that is, in the
                    direction of our interests. If our all-powerful God left us to our
                    own devices, His power would mean nothing to us.
                      Contrast how man has treated Jesus with the way God raised
                    Him from the dead. Left to his own devices, man does not know
                    what is to his best interests. Man rejected Christ (see John 1:11),
                    but God has made Christ the means of man's salvation.
                       Infinitely greater than any power of earth is the power of God.
                    He is the Source of all power in the heavens or in the earth. The
                    power of the mightiest sun or the almost unbelievable power in
                    the smallest atom has its origin in Him. The power in the minds
                    and bodies of men came from Him and is sustained by Him.

                     Where can we find indisputable evidences of God's power?
                    Rom. 1:19, 20.

                      As we ponder upon the infinite power of God, we stand before
                    Him with awe and reverence. "By his spirit he hath garnished
                    the heavens.... Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a
                    portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can
                    understand?" (Job 26:13, 14).

                      How can man receive power to accomplish his daily tasks?
                    Isa. 40:29-31.

                      What special power is available to every Christian? Acts
                    1:8.

 THINK IT THROUGH     If infinite power is available to us, why are we so slow to
                    appropriate it?

                      "Our heavenly Father has a thousand ways to provide for us of
                    which we know nothing. Those who accept the one principle of
                    making the service of God supreme, will find perplexities vanish

              Part 5      What did Abraham hint to God about His judgments?
       THE JUDGE OF
      ALL THE EARTH       "That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the
                       righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as
                       the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the
                       earth do right?" (Gen. 18:25).

                          Abraham was concerned about the safety of Lot, his nephew,
                       now living in Sodom. Would God destroy a righteous man and
                       his family along with the wicked? It seemed unthinkable. Yet
                       what evidence was there that this would not happen? The story
                       in Genesis 18 shows us Abraham pleading with his heavenly
                       visitcr—who was Christ—that God would not destroy a whole
                       city for the sake of ten righteous people in it.
                          The heart of man calls for justice to be done to all, to the
                       righteous as well as the wicked. As it is right for the wicked to be
                       condemned, so it is also right for the righteous to be freed from
                       condemnation.
                          While the Bible teaches that God is the Creator and the Su-
                       preme Ruler of the universe, it also teaches that He is the
                       Supreme Judge who will exercise His saving grace in behalf of
                       the salvation of the righteous and mete out final judgment upon
                       the wicked and rebellious.

                         How will the world be judged and by whom? Acts 17:31.

                         On what basis will Jesus judge men and divide them into two
                       groups? Matt. 25:32-46.

                          "Those whom Christ commends in the judgment may have
                       known little of theology, but they have cherished His principles.
                       Through the influence of the divine Spirit they have been a
                       blessing to those about them. Even among the heathen are
                       those who have cherished the spirit of kindness; before the
                       words of life had fallen upon their ears, they have befriended the
                       missionaries, even ministering to them at the peril of their own
                       lives. Among the heathen are those who worship God ignor-
                       antly, those to whom the light is never brought by human in-
                       strumentality, yet they will not perish. Though ignorant of the
                       written law of God, they have heard His voice speaking to them
                       in nature, and have done the things that the law required. Their
                       works are evidence that the Holy Spirit has touched their hearts,
                       and they are recognized as the children of God."—The Desire of

                      "They shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and
                    every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for they shall all
                    know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them,
                    saith the Lord" (Jer. 31:34).

                      God has made it clear that His efforts for the restoration of this
                    earth from rebellion to loyalty will succeed. The iniquity of this
                    world will ultimately destroy it, and this old world of evil will be
                    replaced by a new world of righteousness. Christ's sacrifice for
                    sinners will not be in vain. This world created by God will be
                    restored to its original purpose. Man created in the image of
                    God will be morally re-created in that image.
                      In ancient times God gave Abraham the promise, "In thee
                    shall all families of the earth be blessed" (Gen. 12:3). Because of
                    his fidelity Abraham became the forerunner of many faithful
                    witnesses who would turn multitudes to God. "Faithful among

                      "Wherever he pitched his tent, close beside it was set up his
                    altar, calling all within his encampment to the morning and
                    evening sacrifice. When his tent was removed, the altar re-
                    mained. In following years, there were those among the roving
                    Canaanites who received instruction from Abraham; and
                    whenever one of these came to that altar, he knew who had
                    been there before him; and when he had pitched his tent, he
                    repaired the altar, and there worshiped the living God."—

                       By what process were the disciples at Pentecost, and their
                    listeners, led to accept God and His full salvation? Acts 2:1-41.

                       Note the following steps:
                       1. The disciples were united in aims and purposes.
                       2. They were endowed with the Holy Spirit.

      THE TRUE GOD
                        Down through history men have worshiped many gods. But
                      there is only one Supreme Deity.
                        "In striking contrast to the nations about them, who were
                      polytheists, the Hebrews believed in one true God. This profes-
                      sion of faith has been the watchword of the Hebrew race for
                      more than 3,000 years (see Mark 12:29). The apostle Paul states
                      the same truth as a tenet of Christianity (1 Cor. 8:4-6; Eph.
                      4:4-6)."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 1, p. 974.

                        How may the true God be characterized? Isa. 43:1, 11, 15.

                         The true God is Creator and Redeemer. He is the One who
                      brought all things into existence in the first place. And He is the
                      One who has provided a way of salvation for fallen man. He is
                      able to tell the end from the beginning. God has perfect
                      knowledge—He knows the past, the present, and the future. It
                      may be conceived that a superior person would know a great
                      deal about the past and the present. But when it comes to the
                      future, only God can penetrate its mysteries and know exactly
                      what will happen. The confirmation of prophecy in its fulfillment
                      is the evidence of its divine source. Only one being is such a
                      God.

                       In what other way than through Scripture can I know about
                      God? Rom. 1:20.

                         Nature speaks to us of God. (See Ps. 19:1.) It tells us that there
                      is a God who brought it into being, because it did not create
                      itself. It also tells us about the greatness of God, because only
                      the true God could have brought into being the vast universe
                      with all its galaxy of stars. Only the true God could have de-
                      signed all the aspects of nature with its infinite detail and mi-
                      croscopic structure. There can be nothing more salutary to man
                      than to look beyond nature to the true God and to worship Him
                      who made the stars and the world and everything that is in it.

 THINK IT THROUGH       If God is good—and He is!—and He has created all things
                      well—and He did!—how is it that there is so much violence In
                      nature?

                        "God made man perfectly holy and happy; and the fair earth,
                      as it came from the Creator's hand, bore no blight of decay or
                      shadow of the curse. It is transgression of God's law—the law of
                      love—that has brought woe and death. Yet even amid the suffer-
                      ing that results from sin, God's love is revealed."—Steps to

Father, Son, and Holy Spirit          LESSON 3                          ❑ Monday
                                                                        October 15
          Part 2  "Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them
    THREE PERSONS in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
                 Ghost" (Matt. 28:19).

                       In this baptismal formula it is notable that the word "name" is
                    in the singular, and then there follows the names, Father, Son,
                    Holy Spirit. Is this a hint of three in one?
                       The word "persons" used in the title of today's lesson must be
                    understood in a theological sense. If we equate human person-
                    ality with God, then we would say that three persons means
                    three individuals. But then we would have three Gods, or tri-
                    theism. Historic Christianity has given to the word "person,"
                    when used of God, a special connotation: a personal self-
                    distinction, which gives distinctiveness in the persons of the
                    Godhead without destroying the concept of oneness. This idea
                    is not easy to grasp—or to explain! It is part of the mystery of the
                    Godhead. It is this revelation which makes the monotheism of
                    Christianity different from that of Judaism or Islam.

                      What hints do we have in the Old Testament of a trinity?
                    (Gen. 1:1-3.)

                       The Hebrew word for God in this passage is Elohim, a plural
                    form. Yet the verb bara, "created," is in the singular form. God
                    speaks, that is, He uses the Word, in creation. (See John 1:1.)
                    And the Spirit of God "moved upon the face of the waters." Here
                    there seems to be an indication of, at least, more than one
                    person. Note also the use of "us" and "our" in this pronounce-
                    ment, "Let us make man in our image" (Gen. 1:26). Some have
                    suggested that this is the "we" of royalty, but it would seem
                    strange for Deity to address Himself, or that He would be as-
                    sociating other created beings in the creation of man. It seems
                    more reasonable to accept this as a hint of persons in the
                    Godhead planning a common strategy.
                       The Old Testament makes reference to the Angel of the Lord,
                     a being who is referred to as having the attributes of God.
                     (Compare the story of Hagar in Genesis 16:7-13 and Genesis
                    48:16, where Jacob refers to the Angel as having redeemed
                     him.) The Messianic promise is of a Son whose names apply to
                     Deity (Isa. 9:6). The Holy Spirit is also mentioned. (See Isa. 11:2;
                     42:1.) The concept of the Trinity is far from being developed, but
                     the elements seem to be there.

 THINK IT THROUGH     In what way does the concept of the Trinity help us to see
                    how God is love?

            Part 3  "After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in
     GOD THE FATHER heaven, Hallowed be thy name" (Matt. 6:9).

                        Jesus taught His disciples to address God as their Father. He
                     made the relationship very personal. They could have this rela-
                     tionship because they were born again. But to those who be-
                     lieved on Jesus, to them was given power "to become the sons
                     of God" (John 1:12).

                       What vision did Daniel have of God the Father? Dan. 7:9,10.

                        "The Ancient of Days is God the Father.... It is He, the source
                     of all being, and the fountain of all law, that is to preside in the
                     judgment. And holy angels as ministers and witnesses, . . .
                     attend this great tribunal."—The Great Controversy, p. 479.
                        Such a picture of the Father should strike one with awe. Our
                     Father loves us with an everlasting love, but we must ever be
                     careful not to be unduly familiar with Him. The hymn expresses
                     it beautifully:
                        "Before Jehovah's awful throne,
                          Ye nations bow with sacred joy;
                        Know that the Lord is God alone;
                          He can create, and He destroy."
                             —Isaac Watts,
                            Church Hymnal, no. 1.

                       Who is the express image of the Father? Heb. 1:2, 3.

                        Sometimes we misunderstand the Father by forgetting that
                     Jesus came to reveal His Father; we must remember that when
                     we see Jesus in His sacrifice and love we are also seeing the
                     Father at work. We must never separate the work of one from
                     the work of the other. God is not demanding, and Jesus plead-
                     ing. They both demand and They both plead.
                        "Christ came to reveal God to the world as a God of love, full
                     of mercy, tenderness, and compassion. The thick darkness with
                     which Satan had endeavored to enshroud the throne of Deity
                     was swept away by the world's Redeemer, and the Father was
                     again manifest to men as the light of life."—Testimonies, vol. 5,
                     pp. 738, 739.
                       The world is at enmity with God because it misunderstands
                     Him. It is for us to change that conception by being God's
                     ambassadors. (See 2 Cor. 5:17-21.)

Father, Son, and Holy Spirit         LESSON 3                    ❑ Wednesday
                                                                   October 17
           Part 4     "The Word became flesh; he came to dwell among us, and
     GOD THE SON    we saw his glory, such glory as befits the Father's only Son,
                    full of grace and truth."
                      "No one has ever seen God; but God's only Son, he who is
                    nearest to the Father's heart, he has made him known" (John
                    1:14, 18, NEB).

                      John wants us to be sure that in Jesus, the Son of the living
                    God, we recognize full Deity. He was God incarnate. (Read
                    verses 1-4.) He was one with the Father and existed with Him
                    from eternity.

                      How did the Jews show that they understood the claim of
                    Jesus to deity? John 5:18. (See Mathew 22:43, 44.)

                      What was the relationship of Jesus to the Holy Spirit? John
                    15:26.

                      Jesus said that He would send the Comforter. In another
                    passage He says that the Father will send the Comforter (John
                    14:26). Thus there seems to be perfect collaboration between
                    the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.

                      What was the close working relationship between the Fa-
                    ther and the Son? John 5:19-22.

                       It is interesting to note that the Father and the Son not only
                    work together, but They assume parallel functions. The Father
                    raises the dead; so does the Son, and He gives life to whom He
                    will. As for judgment, the Father seems to have given this au-
                    thority to the Son, so that there will be mutual honor. (See verse
                    23.) Everlasting life is dependent on hearing what Jesus says
                    and believing in the Father (verse 24). Both Father and Son have
                    life in Themselves (verse 26).

                     After the resurrection, what did Thomas call the risen
                    Christ? John 20:28.

                      There was no doubt in Thomas's mind about the deity of
                    Christ—after he had examined Christ's scars. Jesus told
                    Thomas that he had been given the privilege of the direct touch
                    in order to believe. Then Jesus commended as blessed those
                    who do not have the privilege of visual contact and yet believe
                    (verse 29).

 THINK IT THROUGH     What have you read in the Scriptures so far to indicate
                    clearly that the oneness between the Father and the Son must
                    not negate the distinctiveness of Their persons?

Father, Son, and Holy Spirit          LESSON 3                        ❑ Thursday
                                                                       October 18
            Part 5    "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God,
          GOD THE and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen"
        HOLY SPIRIT (2 Cor. 13:14).

                       This threefold benediction shows that in the days of the apos-
                    tles the doctrine of the Trinity was fairly well understood and
                    accepted. It was for later centuries to work out philosophical
                    and other aspects of the teaching, but the main ideas were
                    already present with the apostolic church.

                      What part did the Holy Spirit have in the birth and baptism of
                    Jesus? Luke 1:35; 3:22.

                      Notice that in both of these verses reference is made to the
                    Three Persons of the Godhead.

                      What evidence is there that the Holy Spirit is a person and
                    not a mere influence?

                       The Spirit speaks (1 Tim. 4:1). The Spirit makes intercession
                    (Rom. 8:26). The Spirit invites (Rev. 22:17). These are all ac-
                    tivities of a person. Furthermore, Paul warns us not to grieve the
                    Holy Spirit (Eph. 4:30).
                       "The Holy Spirit is Christ's representative, but divested of the
                    personality of humanity, and independent thereof. Cumbered
                    with humanity, Christ could not be in every place personally.
                    Therefore it was for their interest that He should go to the
                    Father, and send the Spirit to be His successor on earth. No one
                    could then have any advantage because of his location or his
                    personal contact with Christ. By the Spirit the Saviour would be
                    accessible to all. In this sense He would be nearer to them than if
                    HeThad not ascended on high."—The Desire of Ages, p. 669.
                      ?f-
                       What important function does the Holy Spirit serve in the
                    church? Eph. 4:11-13; 1 Cor. 12:28.

 THINK IT THROUGH     Why do we not have a greater manifestation of the Spirit in
                    the church than we do?

                      "We cannot use the Holy Spirit. The Spirit is to use us.
                    Through the Spirit God works in His people 'to will and to do of
                    His good pleasure.' Phil. 2:13. But many will not submit to this.
                    They want to manage themselves. This is why they do not re-
                    ceive the heavenly gift. Only to those who wait humbly upon
                    God, who watch for His guidance and grace, is the Spirit
                    given."—The Desire of Ages, p. 672.

Father, Son, and Holy Spirit         LESSON 3                         ❑ Friday
                                                                     October 19

          Part 6   "Without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God
    THE MYSTERY was manifest in the flesh, justified in Spirit, seen of angels,
  OF THE GODHEAD preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received
                 up into glory" (1 Tim. 3:16).

                      Paul is impressed with the fact that there are many mysterious
                    aspects of Christian teaching. A mystery is not an impenetrable
                    secret, but a secret that is made known only to the initiated. A
                    man must first be willing to accept the evidence placed before
                    him. He must be open to receive the light that comes his way.

                      What basic element is necessary as we approach the truths
                    revealed in the Bible? Heb. 11:6.

                       There are many aspects of God's nature that we cannot un-
                    derstand; nor should we expect to understand them, since God
                    far transcends man, and man's powers of understanding are
                    limited by the capacity of his mind. Nevertheless it is important
                    to believe what has been revealed.
                       The monotheistic religions other than Christianity tend to
                    limit God by a human concept of oneness. Yet even in the
                    common walk of life we recognize the difference between sim-
                     ple and complex forms of life. How shall amoebas understand
                     man? and how shall man understand God? Why could not the
                    complexity of the Godhead include the concept of three per-
                    sons without destroying unity in a way that is beyond man's
                    ken? We must avoid any view that limits God or makes Him what
                    He is not.

                      Why is it important to know God insofar as He has been
                    revealed? John 17:3.

                      The Christian is what he is because he has accepted the
                    revelation of God in the Bible, and he knows that he lives under
                    the protection and guidance of a wonderful God who is prepar-
                    ing a wonderful future for him.

 THINK IT THROUGH     Why has the Christian church throughout the centuries in-
                    sisted on belief in a three-in-one God?

                      "The Father is all the fullness of the Godhead bodily, and is
                    invisible to mortal sight.
                      "The Son is all the fullness of the Godhead manifested....
                      "The Comforter that Christ promised to send after He as-
                    cended to heaven, isthe Spirit in all the fullness of the Godhead,
                    making manifest the power of divine grace to all who receive
                    and believe in Christ as a personal Saviour."—Evangelism, pp.

                                                                          October 21
              Part 1     By what name does John introduce Jesus in the beginning
          THE WORD     of his Gospel?
            OF GOD
                          "When all things began, the Word already was. The Word
                       dwelt with God, and what God was, the Word was. The Word,
                       then, was with God at the beginning, and through him all
                       things came to be; no single thing was created without him. All
                       that came to be was alive with his life, and that life was the
                       light of men. The light shines on in the dark, and the darkness
                       has never mastered it" (John 1:1-5, NEB).

                         John's language is simple but very deep. One needs to study
                       these verses in great detail in order to draw out the full meaning.
                       For instance, do you fully understand the expression "Word"?
                       Do you see how important the "Word" is? We really do not know
                       Jesus unless we recognize His divinity, His part in Creation, His
                       relation to the Father, and what He has done for man.
                         Jesus is the Word of God. The Word is an expression of God.
                       Through Jesus God expressed Himself to angels and to men. In
                       Jesus is found the expression of the inmost, the dearest, the
                       most vital, the most enduring thoughts of God. Jesus is so
                       completely identified with His Father that He can be considered
                       as His word.

                         When Philip wanted Jesus to reveal the Father, what an-
                       swer did Jesus give? John 14:9.

                         When we become acquainted with Jesus, we become ac-
                       quainted with God. If we desire to become acquainted with the
                       love, the goodness, the ways of God, there is no better way to do
                       this than to become acquainted with Christ. He is God's very
                       word, a perfect expression of His Father.

                         How do we know that the Father and the Son are distinct
                       persons? Matt. 3:17; John 20:17.

                          Because of the complete identification between God and
                       Jesus, between Father and Son, there are those who look upon
                       Them as one and the same person. But that is not true. Jesus
                       was a perfect expression of God, but He was a separate person

                                                                       October 22
           Part 2     According to John, who was the divine Person who created
     THE WORLD'S    the world?
         CREATOR
                      "All things were made by him; and without him was not
                    anything made that was made."
                      "He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and
                    the world knew him not" (John 1:3, 10).

                       Christ's creation of the world was an event of outstanding
                    importance to every human being, to all created beings.
                       "It was Christ that spread the heavens, and laid the founda-
                    tions of the earth. It was His hand that hung the worlds in space,
                    and fashioned the flowers of the field.... It was He that filled the
                    earth with beauty, and the air with song. And upon all things in
                    earth, and air, and sky, He wrote the message of the Father's
                    love."—The Desire of Ages, p. 20.
                       "When God said to His Son, 'Let us make man in our image,'
                    Satan was jealous of Jesus. He wished to be consulted concern-
                    ing the formation of man, and because he was not, he was filled
                    with envy, jealousy, and hatred. . . .
                       "Until this time all heaven had been in order, harmony, and
                    perfect subjection to the government of God."—Early Writings,
                    p. 145. Now, however, the harmony of heaven was broken.
                    Satan was cast out to take up his abode in the newly created
                     world, purposing to carry his rebellion throughout the universe.
                       Man, created in the image of God, was enticed into disobedi-
                    ence. He lost his innocence and happiness and was doomed to
                     suffer the penalty of death.
                       God, however, still loved the world that had rebelled against
                     Him. A plan was devised whereby man could be reclaimed from
                     sin and restored to loyalty and holiness. Jesus came to the world
                     to save it.

                      What was the tragic reception given to Jesus when He
                    came? John 1:11.

                      The scene is beyond understanding, almost beyond belief.
                    Here was something that must not be, that just could not hap-
                    pen, but it did. The Creator of the world was rejected by the
                    world He had come to save!

                      Why does the world reject Christ? John 7:7.

                                                                         October 23
              Part 3     What were the motivation and purpose of Christ's coming to
         CHRIST AND    our world as a man?
         THE FATHER
                         "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten
                       Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but
                       have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to
                       condemn the world; but that the world through him might be
                       saved" (John 3:16, 17).

                         In the plan for man's salvation from sin, there was complete
                       unity between the Father and the Son. Both loved the world.
                       Both gave Themselves to carry through the plan for man's
                       redemption agreed upon before the foundation of the world.
                       God sent the Son and the Son volunteered to go. The result of
                       this unity of purpose and effort was the death of Jesus on the
                       cross and the offer of eternal salvation for man.

                         What facts did Jesus present to show the close unity that
                       exists between Him and the Father? John 10: 15, 17, 30, 36.

                         In the relationship between the Father and the Son there is
                       always the closest possible unity in all things. This is true in
                       thought and purpose, in plan and effort.
                         Jesus said, "I and my Father are one" (John 10:30). "The
                       Father is in me, and I in him" (John 10:38). "He that hath seen
                       me hath seen the Father" (John 14:9).

                         Why does Jesus reflect so perfectly the will and character of
                       the Father? Col. 1:15; Heb. 1:3.

                         In the creation of the world, Father and Son worked together.
                       "God ... created all things by Jesus Christ" (Eph. 3:9). "There is
                       but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him;
                       and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by
                       him" (1 Cor. 8:6).
                         "The unity that exists between Christ and His disciples does
                       not destroy the personality of either. They are one in purpose, in
                       mind, in character, but not in person. It is thus that God and
                       Christ are one."—Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 269.

 THINK IT THROUGH        What implications does the unity of the Father and the Son
                       have for us if we are in Christ?

                         "Jesus revealed no qualities, and exercised no powers, that
                       men may not have through faith in Him. His perfect humanity is
                       that which all His followers may possess, if they will be in
                       subjection to God as he was."—The Desire of Ages, p. 664.

Emmanuel-God With Us             LESSON 4                           ❑ Wednesday
                                                                      October 24
         Part 4   What change did God the Son accept when he came into the
       GOD MADE world?
          FLESH
                  "Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and
                blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that
                through death he might destroy him that had the power of
                death, that is, the devil" (Heb. 2:14). (See also 1:1, 2; 2:8.)

                      It is a great mystery that the God of heaven appeared on earth
                    in the form of human flesh. (See 1 Tim. 3:16.) The God who
                    created the world made the dust which composes the earth.
                    God formed man of the dust. Yet God became man when He
                    came to earth. That mystery is the very heart of Christianity.

                      What prophecy was fulfilled when Jesus was born? Matt.
                    1:21-23. (See Isa. 7:14.)

                       No more joyful or important tidings could have come to man.
                    God was to come down from heaven to earth to live as a human
                    being. The Son of God was to become the Son of man so that
                    children of earth might again become sons of God. "As many as
                    received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of
                    God, even to them that believe on his name" (John 1:12). Divin-
                    ity became humanity in order that sinful humanity might be
                    accepted by God and restored in His image.

                      Why did Jesus come 10. this earth? 2 Cor. 5:21.

                       Jesus came to earth at a time when men had sunk to the
                    lowest depths of vice and iniquity. He took on human flesh after
                    it had been weakened by thousands of years of wickedness. But
                    never once did He yield to sin; never once was He overcome by
                    the powers of evil. He came both to die for men and to show
                    them how to live by the aid of His divine power. As He was
                    victorious against the powers of evil, so He wanted men to know
                    that they also might be victorious.
                       "He gave His only-begotten Son to come to earth, to take the
                    nature of man, not only for the brief years of life, but to retain his
                    nature in the heavenly courts, an everlasting pledge of the
                    faithfulness of God. 0 the depth of the riches both of the wis-
                    dom and love of God! 'Behold, what manner of love the Father
                    hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of
                    God' (1 John 3:1)."—Selected Messages, bk. 1, p. 258.
                        Christ will retain His humanity forever. He will always be God,
                    and He will always continue to be man.

                    live on earth than for you and me?

             Part 5     What song will the redeemed sing of Christ when the conflict
       THE WORLD'S    over sin is ended?
         REDEEMER
                         "Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and
                      riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and
                      blessing" (Rev. 5:12).

                         This is the chorus of praise and victory sung by the redeemed
                      as they stand about the throne at Christ's final coronation. (See
                      The Great Controversy, p. 671.) The saints are there because
                      Christ has redeemed them from death. They were sinners,
                      doomed to eternal death. But now they enjoy eternal life and
                      glory because Jesus has paid the price for their redemption.
                      That price was His life and blood. He died that man might live.
                      He gave up all that they might inherit all. He came from heaven
                      in order that heaven might be theirs eternally. He came from
                      heaven to earth that earth itself might become heaven. He left
                      His position on the throne with His Father that they might reign
                      in glory. Now Jesus, crowned universal King, is accorded the
                      universal acclaim He rightly deserves.

                        How has man been redeemed? 1 Peter 1:18, 19.

                        Christ is the "lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the
                       world" (John 1:29). He is the provision that God had made
                      before the creation of the world (1 Peter 1:20; Rev. 13:8). This is
                      a very important concept to consider. God is not Creator first
                      and Redeemer second. He did not become Redeemer after
                      Adam had sinned. He planned for redemption before creating
                      man. It is not that we want to limit God by a time factor, but it is
                      important to recognize in God an eternal Redeemer as well as
                      an eternal Creator.
                        Satan laid hold to the claim, "prince of this world." Jesus
                      came to earth to dispute that claim and to redeem man from the
                      enemy's hold. As He faced the cross, He said, " 'Now is the hour
                      of judgement for this world; now shall the Prince of this world
                      be driven out. And I shall draw all men to myself, when I am lifted
                      up from the earth.' This he said to indicate the kind of death he
                      was to die" (John 12:31-33, NEB).
                        Christ's death on the cross purchased eternal life to the righ-
                      teous and insured a just judgment for the wicked. The hour of
                      man's redemption by the blood of Christ was the world's great
                      hour of destiny.

THINK IT THROUGH Why Is it that only Christ could pay the price of redemption?

Emmanuel-God With Us             LESSON 4                                  ❑ Friday
                                                                        October 26
          Part 6   In view of what Christ has done for us, how should we
  THE EXALTATION respond to Him?
     OF THE SON
                   "Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him
                 a name which is above every name: that at the name of Jesus
                 every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in
                 earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue
                 should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God
                 the Father" (Phil. 2:9-11).

                      Paul makes it clear that Christ had come from highest heaven
                    to the lowest depths of earthly humiliation. But God could not
                    leave it that way and be just. Jesus now occupies an exalted
                    position, a position which is eminently His due, a position that
                    everyone will recognize.
                      It is notable that in the world people often fight their way to
                    preeminence. This is not true of Christ. People bow in humble
                    submission to Christ because they find in Him a love that excites
                    wonder, surrender, and adoration.

                      What will the Lamb do for the victorious saints? Rev. 7:17.

                       "All who have borne with Jesus the cross of sacrifice will be
                    sharers with Him of His glory. It was the joy of Christ in His
                    humiliation and pain that His disciples should be glorified with
                    Him. They are the fruit of His self-sacrifice. The outworking in
                    them of His own character and spirit is His reward, and will be
                    his joy throughout eternity. This joy they share with Him as the
                    fruit of their labor and sacrifice is seen in other hearts and lives.
                    They are workers together with Christ, and the Father will honor
                    them as He honors His Son."—The Desire of Ages, p. 624.
                       Jesus served the world, but the world rejected Him. Jesus was
                    cast out by the world, but God received Him to glory. He, whom
                    men hated and shunned, God loved and placed on the throne of
                    the universe to receive universal acclaim.

 THINK IT THROUGH     How can we best serve and honor Christ In this life?

                      "No one was so exalted as Christ, and yet He stooped to the
                    humblest duty. That His people might not be misled by the
                    selfishness which dwells in the natural heart, and which
                    strengthens by self-serving, Christ Himself set the example of
                    humility.... While they [the disciples] were contending for the
                    highest place, He to whom every knee shall bow, He whom the

The Holy One

Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts:       law is a transcript of His character and

                                                                         October 28
             Part 1     "Who is like unto thee, 0 Lord, among the gods? who is like
        A HOLY GOD    thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?"
                      (Ex. 15:11).

                         This verse is part of a song of victory that was sung by Moses
                      and the children of Israel after they had crossed the Red Sea and
                      witnessed the destruction of the Egyptian armies. While they
                      had been in Egypt, they had seen many gods. They had seen the
                      gods put to shame by the plagues that had been called down
                      because the Egyptians would not let the children of, Israel go.
                      But now they had witnessed how God can work on behalf of His
                      people. He not only did wonders, but He was "glorious in holi-
                      ness." What does this expression mean?
                         The key idea seems to be separateness, and as applied to God
                      means that He transcends His created works. He is the Supreme
                      Diety to whom nothing can be equal. To worship any other is to
                      worship the lesser one, and that is sinful. Holiness also has a
                      moral quality and suggests that God is morally excellent. Fin-
                      layson says: "Since holiness embraces every distinctive attri-
                      bute of Godhead, it may be defined as the outshining of all that
                      God is. As the sun's rays, combining all the colours of the
                      spectrum, come together in the sun's shining and blend into
                      light, so in His self-manifestation all the attributes of God come
                      together and blend into holiness."—J. D. Douglas, ed., The New

                       What words did Jesus use to address the Father? With what
                      words did the disciples speak of Jesus? John 17:11; Acts 4:30.

                         The Holy Spirit has the adjective used with His name, and thus
                      all Three Persons of the Godhead are called holy.

                       What word did Mary, the mother of Jesus, use to refer to
                      God's name? Luke 1:49.

                         "This commandment not only prohibits false oaths and
                      common swearing, but it forbids us to use the name of God in a

The Holy One        LESSON 5                                          ❑ Monday
                                                                      October 29
           Part 2  "Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for
      HOLY PLACES the place whereon thou standest is holy ground" (Ex. 3:5).

                      Moses was commanded to show respect in the presence of
                    God. In those days reverence was shown by taking off one's
                    shoes. This custom still prevails in some parts of the world. In
                    other parts of the world men show respect by removing the hat,
                    and ladies by covering their heads. It is not the particular mode
                    that is important; it is the fact of reverence.

                      How was reverence to be shown at Mount Sinai? Ex. 19:
                    10-13.

                       God's presence can be terrifying. (See verse 18.) All nature
                    trembles at the presence of God, how much more should sinful
                    man enter into the presence of God with holy fear.
                       The sanctuary was to be a symbol of God's presence with His
                    people (Ex. 29:42, 43). It was to,be a holy place. The garments
                    used by the priests were holy (Ex. 39:41). All the vessels were
                    holy, and the altar was most holy (Ex. 40:9, 10). Wherever God is,
                    and whatever is dedicated to the Lord, is holy.
                       In the same way the temple was holy (Ps. 65:4). The New
                    Jerusalem is the Holy City (Rev. 21:2). All heaven is holy (Ps.
                    20:6).
                       "Humility and reverence should characterize the deportment
                    of all who come into the presence of God. In the name of Jesus
                    we may come before Him with confidence, but we must not
                    approach Him with the boldness of presumption, as though He
                    were on a level with ourselves."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
                    p. 252.
                       The Bible makes it clear that there is a difference between that
                    which is hallowed and that which is common. We ignore those
                    differences to our eternal loss.
                        "To the humble, believing soul, the house of God on earth is
                     the gate to heaven. . . .
                           .. Common talking, whispering, and laughing should not be
                     permitted in the house of worship, either before or after the
                     service. . . .
                        "... If when the people come into the house of worship, they
                     have genuine reverence for the Lord and bear in mind that they
                     are in His presence, there will be a sweet eloquence in
                     silence."—Testimonies, vol. 5, pp. 491, 492.

                                                                       October 30
            Part 3  "Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy,
        A HOLY LAW and just, and good" (Rom. 7:12).

                       Since the law points out sin, and sin brings death, it may be
                     thought that the law is evil. But that is not true, and Paul makes
                     that abundantly clear in his letter to the Romans.

                       Who is the author of the Ten Commandments? Ex. 20:1.

                       It is because God is holy, and just, and good that the com-
                     mandments are also holy, and just, and good. They are a tran-
                     script of His character.

                       Why do people generally dislike the laws of God? Rom. 8:7.

                        Anything that goes contrary to the desires of man in his fallen
                     nature is unpleasant to him. Man wants to be free to do what he
                     pleases, and what he pleases to do is often not for his own good
                     or for the good of others. What man needs to learn is that
                     transgressing the law of God means death, and if he wants to be
                     free to enjoy life, he must learn to live in harmony with the laws
                     of God.

                       By what two phrases does James describe God's law?
                     James 1:25; 2:8, 12.

                       James is clear in pointing out that the only path to real free-
                     dom is that which is bound by the law. It sounds paradoxical!
                     But experience has shown it to be true. Only by observing the
                     laws of harmony is good music composed; only by observing
                     the rules of the game may a race be run and won. Without law
                     there can only be chaos and frustration.

                       What was the attitude of Jesus to the law? Matt. 19:17; 5:17.

                       What, according to the psalmist, are some of the benefits of
                     keeping the law? Ps. 119:165; 19:7, 8.

 THINK IT THROUGH      Why is it that God's laws have not changed down through
                     the centuries?

                        "The very fact that Christ bore the penalty of man's transgres-
                     sion is a mighty argument to all created intelligences that the
                     law is changeless; that God is righteous, merciful, and self-
                     denying; and that infinite justice and mercy unite in the ad-
                     ministration of His government."—Patriarchs and Prophets,

The Holy One        LESSON 5                                       ❑ Wednesday
                                                                     October 31
          Part 4      "God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because
     A HOLY DAY     that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and
                    made" (Gen. 2:3).

                      The weekly cycle has no relationship to any phenomenon of
                    nature, like the day, the month, or the year. It has its origin in a
                    holy God, who created the world in six days and rested the
                    seventh. What did God's sanctifying, or making it holy, really do
                    to the day? It set it apart for a holy use, for a holy communion
                    with a holy God.

                      What did Jesus say about the Sabbath and its Lord? Mark
                    2:27, 28.

                      Man has made the seventh day a day of evil omen, or a day of
                    fasting, or even a day of going to market, or finding one's own
                    pleasure. Jesus pointed out that the day "was designed to bring
                    men into communion with God."—The Desire of Ages, p. 286.
                    Jesus showed that bringing release from sin or disease is in
                    harmony with the purpose of the Sabbath. A day of mere rites
                    and ceremonies could be wearisome, and the whole objective
                    of bringing good to man could be set aside by such a practice.

                      Of what is the Sabbath a memorial? Ex. 20:10,11; Deut. 5:15.

                      The fact that Deuteronomy gives another reason for the keep-
                    ing of the Sabbath does not negate the fact that the Sabbath is a
                    memorial of Creation; it points out that there may be other
                    reasons for keeping the Sabbath, reasons that have to do with
                    our deliverance from sin. There is a hint of this in the fact that
                    the Sabbath is a sign of sanctification. (See Ex. 31:13.) That is, it
                    celebrates our deliverance from the bondage of sin, our re-
                    demption, and our re-creation in regeneration. The Sabbath is
                    not only an institution of the church, but it is also a weekly sign
                    of a personal relationship with a holy God.

                      On what basis is man offered joy and happiness? Isa. 58:
                    13, 14.

                       Unless man can find pleasure in communing with a holy God
                     on earth, he will never enjoy communion with God in the earth
                     made new where the Sabbath will continue to be kept. (See Isa.

The Holy One           LESSON 5                                          ❑ Thursday
                                                                         November 1
              Part 5     "Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not
     A HOLY CALLING    according to our works, but according to his own purpose and
                       grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world
                       began" (2 Tim. 1:9).

                         A holy God issues a holy call. This is not on the basis that we
                       are "holy" or deserve to be "called." We are far from this, but by
                       His grace and through the merits of Jesus Christ this has been
                       made possible. Here we see the goodness of God and His desire
                       that we should share in His holiness.

                         By what term does the writer to the Hebrews address his
                       fellow Christians? Heb. 3:1.

                          Some Christians are reluctant to be called holy. This may be
                       because they have met Christians who have claimed holiness
                       and yet have lived lives which were far from being holy. The fact
                       is that the nearer we come to the pattern that Jesus has set for us
                       the more humble we become. We should not run away from
                       holiness, but we should be sure that the experience we enjoy is
                       genuine and God-given.

                         By what word does the apostle Paul address the Christians
                       to whom he writes? Rom. 1:7; 1 Cor. 1:2; Eph. 1:1.

                         The word "saint" is not a popular word for the believer in
                       Christ today. For one thing it has been used to refer to outstand-
                       ing members of the church who have been officially canonized,
                       and thus cannot be used of everyone. That is why some modern
                       versions of the New Testament in English avoid using the word
                       "saint." The word "saints" is translated "his dedicated people"
                       (Rom. 1:7, NEB), "his own people" (Rom. 1:7, TEV), and "God's
                       holy people" (1 Cor. 1:2, TEV).

                         In what only did Paul find cause to glory? Gal. 6:14.

                          Paul lived a life that we may be proud to emulate. But the fact
                       is that Paul recognized that he was nothing in himself. (See Gal.
                       2:20.) He could glory only in the cross because that was the
                       symbol of the salvation that had been purchased for him, and it
                       was the reason why he could be what he was.
                          "Paul realized that his sufficiency was not in himself, but in
                       the presence of the Holy Spirit, whose gracious influence filled
                       his heart, bringing every thought into subjection to Christ."—
                       The Acts of the Apostles, p. 251.

THINK IT THROUGH         How is it that some people have joined the church, keep the
                       Sabbath, and yet are far from being holy in their business
                       relationships?

                                                                       November 2
          Part 6      "For their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also may be
       HOLINESS     sanctified through the truth" (John 17:19).
       THROUGH
         CHRIST        In praying to His Father, Jesus says that He sanctifies Himself,
                    or consecrates Himself (NEB), or dedicates Himself (TEV) so
                    that His disciples may be sanctified, consecrated, and dedi-
                    cated as well. This is an example of total commitment. A holy
                    God is dedicated to the cause of having a holy people. Could
                    anything be more appealing to produce a response of dedica-
                    tion?

                      What is God's desire for His people? Lev. 11:44, 45;1 Peter
                    1:16.

                      This is a high standard. Created in the image of God, man is to
                    reflect fully his Maker.

                      Why is this standard so important? Heb. 12:14.

                      God cannot let any standards down. Only the pure in heart
                    can see God. (See Matt. 5:8.)
                      "Into the city of God there will enter nothing that defiles. All
                    who are to be dwellers there will here have become pure in
                    heart. In one who is learning of Jesus, there will be manifest a
                    growing distaste for careless manners, unseemly language, and
                    coarse thought. When Christ abides in the heart, there will be
                    purity and refinement of thought and manner."—Thoughts
                    From the Mount of Blessing, pp. 24, 25.
                      "Holiness is not rapture: it is an entire surrender of the will to
                    God; it is living by every word that proceeds from the mouth of
                    God; it is doing the will of our heavenly Father; it is trusting God
                    in trial, in darkness as well as in the light; it is walking by faith
                    and not by sight; it is relying on God with unquestioning confi-
                    dence, and resting in His love."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 51.

                      How can the Christian attain this ideal? Phil. 4:13.

                       "As the will of man co-operates with the will of God, it be-
                    comes omnipotent. Whatever is to be done at His command may
                    be accomplished in His strength. All His biddings are enablings."

                       "There must be a power working from within, a new life from
                    above, before- men can be changed from sin to holiness. That
                    power is Christ. His grace alone can quicken the lifeless facul-
                    ties of the soul, and attract it to God, to holiness."—Steps to

                                                                         November 4
              Part 1     What does John say is a basic characteristic of God?
        GOD IS LOVE
                        "We have known and believed the love that God hath to us.
                       God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and
                       God in him" (1 John 4:16).

                          Love is the very nature of God. Everything He does is
                       prompted by love. His love may be seen in all His works. The
                        wondrous love of God is revealed in things of the world about
                        us, in the infinite expanses of the heavens above. If we would
                       see love, we must see God. And no man can see love without
                       seeing God. He who feels the touch of God feels the touch of
                       love.
                          Human vision is limited, and we do not always see love in the
                       ways and works of God. We live in a world where other powers
                       are at work that are not from God, and they must not be con-
                       fused with God. Children do not always perceive their parents'
                       love in deeds of the greatest wisdom and most tender concern.
                       The more fully human eyes are opened, and the more com-
                       prehensive man's understanding becomes, the more clearly he
                       is able to see that God indeed is love.
                          Were it not for a God of love, there would be no world and no
                       men to inhabit it. Were not God a being of love, He would not be
                       the embodiment of infinite wisdom and power. God's power
                       exerts itself always, and only, in love. God's love is creative and
                       not destructive. God's wisdom manifests itself in constant out-
                       pourings of love in gifts to make men happy and to keep them
                       well.
                         Love is personal. It must have someone to love, someone with
                       whom to share. Unless it can expend itself in deeds of affection
                       toward others, it is not happy and it is not love. Love craves love
                       and creates love. The more it manifests itself, the wider will be
                       the circle of happiness and love.

                         How basic is love to a Christian? Eph. 3:17-19.

                         All the highest attributes in the souls of men are due to love,
                       and due to God. Mercy, sympathy, justice, goodness, truthful-
                       ness, and unselfishness all come from love and cannot exist
                       without it. These attributes find their fullest expression in God.
                       He is "merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in
                       goodness and truth" (Ex. 34:6).

The God of Love        LESSON 6                                        ❑ Monday
                                                                      November 5
          Part 2      What was Jesus' summary of the Ten Commandments and
      GOD'S LAW     the teaching of Scripture?
        OF LOVE
                       "Master, which is the great commandment in the law?
                    Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all
                    thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the
                    first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it,
                    Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two com-
                    mandments hang all the law and the prophets" (Matt. 22:36-
                    40).

                      There can be no greater law than love. Love embraces every
                    duty of man—to God, and to those in the world about him. If a
                    man has supreme love for God, he will do all that God com-
                    mands. If he loves his fellowmen, he will do nothing against
                    them.
                      In heaven, the law of angels is the law of love. They need no
                    other law, for their every thought and deed is always, and only,
                    love. With fallen man, however, that is not the case. The details
                    of right and wrong in his relationships with God and man need
                    to be set before him in more specific detail. That is why God's
                    law of Ten Commandments was given, with the first four point-
                    ing out his love and duties to God, and the last six, his love and
                    duties to man.

                      What is the basis of our love for God? Deut. 5:6; Ex. 20:2.

                      The saving acts of God in our lives form the basis of our
                    relationship to God. God nad brought Israel out of Egypt with a
                    mighty arm and so the Israelites were under obligation to rec-
                    ognize Him as the one true God. They were to remember His
                    acts of Creation (Ex. 20:11) and deliverance (Deut. 5:15). They
                    would be moved to respond in grateful love.
                      You and I have experienced God's hand in our lives, so the
                    least that we can do is to thank Him and to love Him. As God
                    bade Moses to say to Israel, "Ye shall be holy: for I the Lord your
                    God am holy" (Lev. 19:2), one of the specifications was, "Thou
                    shalt love thy neighbour as thyself" (verse 18). Love was as
                    important in the days of Moses as it was at the time of Christ. It
                    was ever the basis of God's law as it is ever the foundation of
                    God's eternal throne.

                      How do we show that we love God? John 14:15; 1 John 5:2, 3.

 THINK IT THROUGH     How can the Christian have love and hate in his heart? (See

                                                                          November 6
              Part 3     By what fact does Paul measure the depth of God's love?
         GOD'S LOVE
     TOWARD SINNERS      "Scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure
                       for a good man some would even dare to die. But God corn-
                       mendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners,
                       Christ died for us" (Rom. 5:7, 8).

                          God has manifested His love in untold ways—in His works of
                       creation and preservation, in bringing into existence holy be-
                       ings who are to be eternally happy, in maintaining an endless
                       universe by boundless wisdom and love. But God's greatest
                       demonstration of love was the love He manifested toward sin-
                       ners who were in rebellion against Him.
                          Sinners need love, but they do not deserve it. What they
                       deserve is death, but it is from death that God purposes to save
                       them. Only love could have prompted that purpose. Justice
                       demanded that guilty man should die. But God's love provided a
                       substitute.
                         God loves not only good men but bad men, not only one man
                       but all men. God loves men who did not love Him. He loves men
                       who rejected His love and spurned His mercy, who love sin
                       rather than righteousness, and who chose ways of death rather
                       than ways of life. God loves men who would despise and reject
                       His Son, who came to save them. He loves them even though
                       they would put His Son to death on a cruel cross, demanding
                       death for the Prince of Life but clemency for a servant of the
                       prince of evil. And God would still love them in spite of their cry
                       that the blood for such a foul deed be upon themselves and their
                       children!

                         Because of God's great love, of what may the Christian be
                       confident? Rom. 8:38, 39.

                         Paul lists a number of elements that might be strong and
                       might be considered able to prevent God from reaching men
                       with His love. But Paul holds them up to ridicule. Not one of
                       them.is more powerful than God, not one of them can be con-
                       sidered an obstacle to God's saving grace.
                         And it took just such love to save us. Nothing less would have
                       sufficed. Unless God had been willing to give up His Son for
                       sinners, they could not have been saved. Unless Jesus would
                       have given up His throne and His life for sinners, they would
                       have perished in their iniquity. "We, like the rest, lay under the
                       dreadful judgement of God. But God, rich in mercy, for the great
                       love he bore us, brought us to life with Christ" (Eph. 2:3, 4, NEB).

 THINK IT THROUGH        In what sense was God loving and just in His provision for
                       the salvation of man?

The God of Love        LESSON 6                                   ❑ Wednesday
                                                                   November 7
         Part 4  "Bless the Lord, 0 my soul, and forget not all his benefits:...
         GOD'S who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee
 LOVING-KINDNESS with lovingkindness and tender mercies" (Ps. 103:2-4).

                      The word translated "lovingkindness" has been translated in
                    a number of different ways: "mercy," "kindness," and "good-
                    ness" in the KJV. The RSV translates it "steadfast love." Two
                    related ideas are "covenant" and "faithfulness." (Compare
                    S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 3, pp. 719, 720.)
                      The thought of the psalmist seems to be that God has given a
                    covenant to His people and has been faithful to it, and this
                    relationship can be considered as honorable and glorious as
                    the wearing of a crown.
                      God's ways are ways of incomparable kindness, and His gifts
                    are those of the most tender love. No mother ever displayed
                    greater love for her child than does God for His children. Where
                    God is, there His loving-kindness is revealed and His goodness
                    and mercy are displayed.
                      Wherever we find loveliness and harmony, grandeur and vir-
                    tue, it is because of God's goodness and love. If only the eyes of
                    our spiritual vision were opened, we would everywhere see
                    evidences of God's tender, all-pervading, never-failing love. We
                    would see God's love in rain as well as sunshine, in the clouds
                    above and the grass beneath.

                      What is the basis of true happiness? Ps. 144:15.

                      The psalmist mentions several things that can make for hap-
                    piness (see verses 11-14). But they are all summed up in one
                    blessing, God is our Lord. He is the source and wellspring of all
                    happiness.
                      God's greatest desire is that all men be truly happy, and
                    eternally remain that way. He created men in His own likeness
                    that they might be happy—happy in Him, in themselves, and
                    happy with all the world about them. "Man, created for fellow-
                    ship with God, can only in such fellowship find his real life and
                    development. Created to find in God his highest joy, he can find
                    in nothing else that which can quiet the cravings of the heart,
                    can satisfy the hunger and thirst of the soul."—Education, pp.
                    124, 125.

                      What special blessings come to the man whose relationship
                    with God is right? Ps. 103:1, 3, 5.

                    God?

The God of Love             LESSON 6                                       ❑ Thursday
                                                                           November 8
               Part 5     What is the aim of God's great love?
     GOD'S UNIVERSAL
                LOVE      "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son,
                        that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have
                        everlasting life" (John 3:16).

                          This text has been described as "the gospel in a nutshell." It
                        indicates the wide scope of God's love—the world; it tells us of
                        the sacrifice involved—He gave His only Son; it points out the
                        purpose of God's act—that all who believe in Him should not
                        die, but have eternal life.
                          All men are loved by God, and all men experience His bless-
                        ings. This is true of the wicked as well as the righteous, the poor
                        and humble as well as the mighty and the well-to-do. Men of
                        every clime, every race, every creed are loved by Him. Wherever
                        prayer is offered, God is ready to hear.

                          What does Matthew 5:45 teach about God's love?

                          Man usually discriminates in his love, but that is not true of
                        God and must not be true of those who claim to be Christian.
                        The Christian standard of relationship to other people is that of
                        God the Father, who distributes His gifts bountifully without
                        regard to worthiness or response. The main criterion is that of
                        need. The good and the bad alike need sunshine and rain, and
                        God supplies them impartially. Does my enemy need my wit-
                        ness? If so, then it is my responsibility, as a Christian, to reach
                        out a helping hand and do what God would do if He were in my
                        place.

                          What did Jesus say about His Father's care? Matt. 10:29-31;
                        6:26-31.

                           Everything, animate or inanimate, constantly experiences the
                        care of God. "The Lord is good to all: and his tender mercies are
                        over all his works" (Ps. 145:9). "The eyes of all wait upon thee;
                        and thou givest them their meat in due season. Thou openest
                        thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every living thing" (verses
                        15, 16). "The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all
                        that call upon him in truth" (verse 18).
                          God sent Israel into Canaan with the admonition, "Be strong
                        and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the
                        Lord thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee,
                        nor forsake thee" (Deut. 31:6).

The God of Love       LESSON 6                                         ❑ Friday
                                                                     November 9
           Part 6  What was God's attitude to Israel when they were unworthy
    GOD'S NEVER- of His love?
    FAILING LOVE
                   "How can I give you up, Israel?
                     How can I abandon you?
                   Could I ever destroy you as I did Admah,
                     or treat you as I did Zeboiim?
                   My heart will not let me do it!
                     My love for you is too strong" (Hosea 11:8, TEV).

                      Admah and Zeboiim are two cities of the plains that were
                    destroyed with Sodom and Gomorrah. (See Gen. 14:2; 19:25,
                    29.) Fire and brimstone rained down from heaven (Gen. 19:24)
                    and the "smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a
                    furnace" (verse 28).
                      There comes a time when God must punish evil. But it is not a
                    pleasant task for a God of love.

                      What is God's attitude to the sinner? Eze. 18:31, 32; 33:11.

                      God's grace is amazing! Tenderly, and with gentle persis-
                    tence, He pleads with sinners. The wicked need only to respond
                    and in repentance turn away from their sins, and God is willing
                    to accept them. He will forget the past, however wicked it may
                    be, because God is more concerned with the present and the
                    future than He is with the past.
                      The question God asks, Why will ye die? is a very pertinent
                    one. Would any sane person choose death? When life is offered
                    on such easy terms, it is utter foolishness to reject it.

                      Why does God seem to delay His second coming? 2 Peter
                    3:9.

                      It would seem that God would rather break His word than
                    cause any one to perish! God is not slow to do what He has
                    promised, but He is willing to give every opportunity for the
                    sinner to repent and thus be ready for His coming.

                      What kind of a person is the man who truly loves? 1 Cor.
                    13:4-7.

                      Here is the standard of perfection outlined for the Christian. Is
                    he willing to endure trying circumstances and not lose his
                    temper? Is he looking for ways and means to help people,
                    generous with his time and money? Does he accept his talents
                    and station in life without envy 'although he sees someone else
                    more talented and successful?

                                             heart that is in harmony with God is a
                                            partaker of the peace of heaven and
                                            will diffuse its blessed influence on all
                                             around."

             Part 1     What promise did Jesus make regarding peace?
        PEACE FROM
             JESUS      "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the
                      world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled,
                      neither let it be afraid" (John 14:27).

                         Peace is God's gift to men. Jesus is "The Prince of Peace"
                      (Isa. 9:6). "He is our peace" (Eph. 2:14). "He will bring peace"
                      (Micah 5:5, TEV). Without God men can not know peace. When
                      Jesus was born, the angels sang "On earth peace, good will
                      toward men" (Luke 2:14).

                       What is the source of peace for the believer? Col. 1:20-22;
                      Rom. 5:1.

                        Through Christ and His cross the enmity between sinners and
                      God is broken, and reconciliation with heaven is restored.
                        "The effect of God's provision of righteousness by faith is to
                      bring peace to the sinner's once troubled and alienated soul.
                      Before the experience of justification the sinner is in a state of
                      enmity against God, as shown by his rebellion against God's
                      authority and his transgression of God's laws. But after he is
                      reconciled, he has peace with God. Before, while still under a
                      sense of the guilt of sin, he has nothing but fear and unrest in his
                      conscience. Now, with his sins forgiven, he has peace in his
                      heart, realizing that all his guilt has been taken away."—S.D.A.

                        What famous blessing is often invoked upon a congregation
                      and what particular blessing is desired? Num. 6:24-26.

                        It is the holiness and righteousness of God that make Him a
                      God of peace. So it is the uprightness of His children that makes
                      them people of peace.

                        What is the nature of the peace that comes to the Christian
                      through Christ? What will it do? Phil. 4:6, 7.

                      about securing it?

                        "The believer is not called upon to make his peace with God;
                      he never has nor ever can do this. He is to accept Christ as his
                      peace, for with Christ is God and peace."—Selected Messages,

The God of Peace         LESSON 7                                    ❑ Monday
                                                                    November 12
           Part 2     If man is to see God, how should he relate to his fellowman?
       PEACE AND
        HOLINESS     "Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no
                    man shall see the Lord" (Heb. 12:14).

                       The injunction to "follow peace" suggeststhat it is not easy to
                    live at peace; it requires a goal that is pursued with diligence,
                    with no regard to obstacles. The Christian aims to be in the state
                    of peace without conflicts.
                       It should be noted that peace means more than the absence of
                    war or trouble. It means that justice has been satisfied, that
                    everyone is at rest because everyone has reached that state
                    where there is no more jealousy, greed, or hatred. There are no
                    more disputes or grievances to settle. Peace is, therefore, a
                    positive attribute of having attained the highest good. All of this
                    is yet future.
                       But in the present we are to be at "peace with all men." Is this
                    a practical aim? Some people are easy to get along with; some
                    people are impossible! Or can the Christian be at peace, even
                    with an enemy? At least the goal is there, and the Christian can
                    never be satisfied with his efforts until he has come to some
                    agreement of living in peace with every person that comes into
                    his life.

                      How can anyone have perfect peace? Isa. 26:3.

                      Peace is not only a relationship with our fellowmen; it is
                    primarily a relationship with God. It means that we are not
                    worried about the present or the future. We are not afraid of
                    judgment. We have no sense of guilt. Only the man who is right
                    with God can be at peace with himself and the world.

                     According to the writer of Hebrews, what other attribute
                    must go along with peace? Heb. 12:14.

                      Peace is very closely connected to holiness, and holiness is
                    closely connected with God. It is not a matter of peace at any
                    price! The Christian must pursue his goal of peace only in ways
                    compatible with his principles. Genuine peace is a matter of the
                    heart and the spirit.
                      Peace within produces happiness. God's people are a happy
                    people because they are a peaceful people. Heaven will be a
                    place of happiness because it is a place of peace. "The meek
                    shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abun-
                    dance of peace" (Ps. 37:11).

The God of Peace           LESSON 7                                   ❑ Tuesday
                                                                     November 13
             Part 3    What is the connection between the law of God and peace
     PEACE AND THE    among men?
       LAW OF GOD
                        "Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing
                      shall offend them" (Ps. 119:165).

                         God's law is the secret of peace, within and without, in this
                       world and in heaven, today and throughout eternity. Peace can
                       prevail only where and as long as God's law prevails.
                         The principles on which the law is based are principles which
                       would keep man at peace with God, with all the world about
                      Him, and with himself. No man can find happiness or peace
                      without this law. If he disregards any of its precepts or violates
                      any of its commands, he creates trouble for himself and brings
                      turmoil to those about him. If he loves these commandments
                      and lives them out in his life, it will be gain for himself and
                      others, for it is thus that happiness, justice, and peace will be
                      maintained.
                         Lawmakers throughout the world would have little to do if
                      men could learn to respect and obey God's law. Officers of the
                      peace would not be needed. The problems that afflict our cities,
                      the crime that is plaguing the land, the lawlessness that is
                      threatening the very existence of civilization would be done
                      away if men could only be brought to respect God's law.
                         God designed His law to preserve a close and happy fellow-
                      ship between Himself and all created beings. If any of its first
                      four precepts are violated, there is conflict between man and
                      God. If any of the last six commandments are broken, there is
                      conflict, not only between man and his fellows, but also be-
                      tween man and God.

                        What is the source of fightings and wars? James 4:1-4.

                         War erupted in heaven because Lucifer violated the very first
                      principle of the law in his endeavor to set up his throne above
                      the throne of God. Because man disobeyed, Eden was deprived
                      of peace, and man was robbed of the tranquility and happiness
                      that God had placed in his soul. Sin brought unrest.
                        Heaven will be the eternal abode of all happiness and peace,
                      because all who abide there have God's law of peace written in
                      their hearts and they live it out in their lives.

The God of Peace         LESSON 7                                   ❑ Wednesday
                                                                     November 14
           Part 4     How only can man have peace in the heart?
  PEACE—A FRUIT
    OF THE SPIRIT     "The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering,
                    gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against
                    such there is no law" (Gal. 5:22, 23).

                         Peace is not natural for sinful man. When he was first created
                    in God's image, man had peace; but when sin entered, peace
                    departed. Instead of enjoying the presence of God and placing
                    complete trust in Him, man became afraid of God and tried to
                    hide from His presence.
                         It is ever the baleful work of sin to drive man farther and
                    farther from God, and more and more to erase the divine image.
                    Instead of love he is filled with hate; instead of joy there is
                    discontent and sorrow; instead of peace there is anxiety and
                    hostility. In the midst of the most peaceful scenes of nature man
                    may find irritation and irascibility within his soul. With sunshine
                    all about him there may be darkness within.
                         The fearful, doubtful heart of man needs restoration. It needs
                    to come back to peace and God. Man needs God, and God
                    wants man. Man needs peace, but he doesn't know how to find
                    it. Inwardly he wants to do right, but his evil heart does not allow
                     it.

                     What is Paul's description of the experience of the natural
                    man who wants to do right? Rom. 7:19, 23, 24.

                       Although man's natural heart is against God, against right,
                    against peace, it need not remain so. God has provided a rem-
                    edy. He has sent His Holy Spirit into the world to convict man of
                    sin and give him strength to overcome. Instead of the works of
                    flesh, he is to enjoy the fruits of the Spirit. In place of hatred,
                    variance, wrath, and strife, the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, and
                    peace.

                      In order to enjoy real peace, what kind of mind must a man
                    have? Rom. 8:6.

 THINK IT THROUGH     What lessons may we learn from the fruit tree regarding
                    bearing fruit in the Christian life?

                      "The mighty power of the Holy Spirit works an entire trans-
                    formation in the character of the human agent, making him a
                    new creature in Christ Jesus. . . . The peace that dwells in the

The God of Peace            LESSON 7                                     ❑ Thursday
                                                                        November 15
              Part 5     How can you harmonize Christ's promises of peace with His
         PEACE AND     statement in Matthew 10:34?
         THE SWORD
                        "Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came
                       not to send peace, but a sword" (Matt. 10:34).

                         Christ's words point to the nature of His conflict against
                       Satan. The Prince of Peace is engaged in a death struggle
                       against the prince of darkness. Begun in heaven, that struggle
                       continues on earth.
                         The crushing of Lucifer's rebellion was not merely a battle for
                       power or authority. It was primarily a war against wrong. Righ-
                       teousness can never compromise with wickedness. Truth must
                       ever be arrayed against error, light against darkness, justice
                       against injustice, peace against war.

                         What victory assured final peace? Rev. 12:7-10.

                          Christ's war against evil must and will be fought to the end,
                       until the dragon is so decidedly beaten that he will never raise
                       his wicked head again. Evil must be completely eliminated.
                          People need to learn the nature and ultimate outcome of this
                       struggle. Both the righteous and the wicked need to learn what
                       is going on and why; who the contestants are and what they
                       stand for; and what this struggle involves for themselves and
                       the world, for unfallen beings throughout the universe, and for
                       the honor and stability of God's throne.

                         What danger does the Christian always face? 1 Peter 5:8.

                         Christ's word about the sword had a sure, early, and sad
                       fulfillment. His own disciples were to experience it. John the
                       Baptist had already fallen, and Stephen was soon to fall. Peter
                       and John in prison (Acts 4:1-3), the apostles in the common jail
                       (Acts 5:18), the scattering of the church before the persecuting
                       Saul (Acts 8:1-3; 9:1, 2), the vexed church at the hands of Herod
                       and the death of James with the sword (Acts 12:1,2), the numer-
                       ous persecutions of Paul (see 2 Cor. 11:23-26), and the banish-
                       ment of John to Patmos (Rev. 1:9)—all point to the certainty that
                       the teaching of righteousness is met by the bitter hostility of the
                       forces of evil. Jesus died because of the wrath of the dragon. In
                       the last days God's people will experience that wrath again
                       (Rev. 12:17).

                                                                     November 16
           Part 6   How can one enjoy inward peace midst outward strife and
   THE PEACE OF turmoil?
  GOD'S CHILDREN
                    "Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and
                  supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made
                  known unto God. And the peace of God, which passeth all
                  understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through
                  Christ Jesus" (Phil. 4:6, 7).

                       God possesses perfect peace because of His perfect holiness.
                     Peace comes to the believer as a gift from Him.
                       While the wicked know not peace, the children of God are
                     freed from their own hostility.

                       What should be the aim of every Christian?

                        God's people are peaceful people, and their ways are ways of
                     righteousness. (See Isa. 32:17, 18.) "Great shall be the peace of
                     thy children" (Isa. 54:13). "Mark the perfect man, and behold
                     the upright: for the end of that man is peace" (Ps. 37:37). "In his
                     days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so
                     long as the moon endureth" (Ps. 72:7). "The meek shall inherit
                     the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of
                     peace" (Ps. 37:11).

                      How does the wise man describe the man who gets wisdom,
                     understanding, and peace? Prov. 3:13, 17.

                        It should be noted that wisdom for the wise man was iden-
                     tified with God and righteousness. "The fear of the Lord is the
                     beginning of wisdom." "I lead in the way of righteousness"
                     (Prov. 9:10; 8:20).
                         Peaceful people are happy people, and holy joy will mark the
                     paths of God's children.
                         God calls His people to peace—peace with Him and with each
                     other. "God hath called us to peace" (1 Cor. 7:15). "As much as
                     lieth in you, live peaceably with all men" (Rom. 12:18). "Be of
                     one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be
                     with you" (2 Cor. 13:11). "Let the peace of God rule in your
                     hearts" (Col. 3:15).

 THINK IT 'THROUGH     Why is peace so important to the people of God?

                       "Those who take Christ at His word, and surrender their souls
                     to His keeping, their lives to His ordering, will find peace and
                     quietude. Nothing of the world can make them sad when Jesus
                     makes them glad by His presence. In perfect acquiescence
                     there is perfect peace."—The Desire of Ages, p. 331.

Wonderful, Counsellor            LESSON 8                                ❑ Sunday
                                                                       November 18
             Part 1     What is unique about God's wisdom and knowledge?
        COUNSEL OF
           WISDOM       "Who hath directed the Spirit of the Lord, or being his coun-
                      sellor hath taught him? With whom took he counsel, and who
                      instructed him, and taught him in the path of judgment, and
                      taught him knowledge, and shewed to him the way of under-
                      standing?" (Isa. 40:13, 14).

                         With whom could the Creator of the world, the One infinite in
                      power, wisdom, and knowledge, have taken counsel when He
                      brought the world into being? He alone knows and understands
                      all. Only He can teach all others, but has no one who can instruct
                      Him. Only He can give unerring counsel to all, but has none to
                      direct His ways.

                        What contrast does Solomon make between the man who
                      seeks counsel and the man who does not? Prov. 12:15.

                         God is the embodiment of wisdom as well as love. This is true
                      of the Son as well as the Father. In the eighth chapter of Prov-
                      erbs the coming Messiah is identified with wisdom. "Counsel is
                      mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have strength"
                      (Prov. 8:14). "I love them that love me; and those that seek me
                      early shall find me" (verse 17) is said as much of the Saviour as it
                      is of wisdom. Quoting Proverbs 8:22, God's messenger says,
                      "The Son of God declares concerning Himself: 'The Lord pos-
                      sessed Me in the beginning of His way, before His works of old.
                      I was set up from everlasting.' "—Patriarchs and Prophets, p.
                      34. Wisdom was with God before He founded the world, and
                      Jesus was there at His side.

                       What kind of people receive counsel and guidance from
                      God? Ps. 25:9.

                         God being the embodiment of wisdom, all His counsel is wise.
                      And God being the embodiment of love, all His counsel is good.
                      It is wisdom for man to listen to counsel of wisdom. He might
                      have kept His wisdom to Himself; but had He done so, He would
                      not have been God, for love called for the sharing of His wisdom
                      and counsel with those in need.
                          "Let God teach you His way. Inquire of Him daily to know His
                      will. He will give unerring counsel to all who seek Him with a
                      sincere heart."—Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 276.

 THINK IT THROUGH       What will God do after guiding man with His counsel? Ps.
                      73:24.

                        If God has counsel for me in His Word and I fail to read it or
                      heed it, what may I expect as a result? .

Wonderful, Counsellor         LESSON 8                                ❑ Monday
                                                                     November 19

           Part 2     How does God draw us to Himself?
 COUNSEL OF LOVE
                      "I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with
                    lovingkindness have I drawn thee" (Jer. 31:3).

                      True love does not forget. It always seeks to help, never to
                    hurt. One of the best ways in which love can manifest itself is by
                    giving counsel. Gifts of counsel are often of greater value than
                    any other gifts. They cannot be measured in terms of material
                    value, although at times they are of the highest material value.
                      Heavenly counsel provides us with the greatest values we can
                    obtain in life.
                      Counsel from people is not always prompted by love and is
                    not always wise. People may give counsel to others which they
                    would not want for themselves. Counsel from people may be for
                    the purpose of benefiting the giver rather than the receiver.
                      God's counsel is always prompted by love, and is always
                    helpful and wise. Accepted, God's counsel may seem to hurt at
                    the time, but its fruitage is always good.

                      What does God do to those whom He loves? Rev. 3:19.

                      Jesus at times administered counsel in terms of stern rebuke,
                    but when He did, it was prompted by love. "He spoke the truth,
                    but always in love. He denounced hypocrisy, unbelief, and in-
                    iquity; but tears were in His voice as He uttered His scathing
                    rebukes."—Steps to Christ, p. 12.
                      As persons and situations differ, so counsel varies. What is
                    good counsel for one may prove to be poor counsel for others.
                    When men follow counsel intended for others in entirely dif-
                    ferent circumstances, the results they reap may be ill instead of
                    good. But God must not be blamed for man's lack of judgment
                    or discernment.

                      What counsel did Jesus give to a rich young ruler? Matt.
                    19:21.

                       Counsel from Heaven is always for man's best interests. "God
                    does not require us to give up anything that it is for our best
                    interest to retain. In all that He does, He has the well-being of His
                    children in view. . . . Man is doing the greatest injury and
                    injustice to his own soul when he thinks and acts contrary to the
                    will of God."—Steps to Christ, p. 46.

         COUNSEL TO
         A MINISTER      "To Timothy, my dearly beloved son."
                         "Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding
                       in all things" (2 Tim. 1:2; 2:7).

                         Although Paul's words were directed to Timothy, they are of
                       value to all who aspire to being God's helping hand or minister.
                         Timothy was a young minister with his future before him. In
                       his future work he might be merely mediocre; he might be a
                       failure; or he might be an outstanding success. Paul loved
                       Timothy as his own son and gave him the best counsel he could
                       so that he might make a success in his work for God.

                         How should a young pastor conduct himself in relation to
                       other people and the doctrines of the church? 1 Tim. 4:12, 15,
                       16.

                          "Paul urged Timothy to meditate upon those things that are
                       pure and excellent, that his profiting might appear unto all. The
                       same counsel is greatly needed by men of the present age.
                       I urge upon our workers the necessity of purity in every thought,
                       every act. We have an individual accountability to God, an indi-
                       vidual work which no one else can do for us. It is to strive to
                       make the world better. While we should cultivate sociability, let
                       it not be merely for amusement, but for a higher purpose."—
                       Gospel Workers, p. 125.

                         What counsel does Paul give about money? 1 Tim. 6:10.

                         "The Bible condemns no man for being rich, if he has ac-
                       quired his riches honestly. Not money, but the love of money, is
                       the root of all evil. It is God who gives men power to get wealth;
                       and in the hands of him who acts as God's steward, using his
                       means unselfishly, wealth is a blessing, both to its possessor
                       and to the world."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 212.

                         What truth did Paul note to encourage Timothy to be fear-
                       less? 2 Tim. 1:7, 8.

                         When one is on the side of right, on the side of God, there is no
                       reason to fear. Note how Jesus was unafraid in the storm and
                       before the two demoniacs. (See Matt. 8:23-34.)

THINK IT THROUGH        Read 2 Timothy 2:1, 3, 15, 19; 3:14,15; 4:2, 5, and indicate the
                       ways in which this counsel is relevant to us today.

                                                                       November 21
             Part 4     Why is it important to fear God?
 HEAVEN'S COUNSEL
           FOR ALL      "Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God,
                      and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of
                      man" (Eccl. 12:13).

                        What similar thought was expressed by Jesus in Matthew
                      6:33?

                        No better counsel can be given than to make first things first.
                      True religion requires an ordering of priorities. Eternity is at
                      stake. If a man loses heaven, he loses everything. If a man does
                      not find God in this world and fails to love in accord with His
                      ways, he not only loses the finest and best that this life can offer,
                      but eternal life as well.

                        Why is it not necessary for a Christian to worry about his
                      daily needs? Matt. 6:25-30.

                         "God's law is the law of love. He has surrounded you with
                      beauty to teach you that you are not placed on earth merely to
                      delve for self, to dig and build, to toil and spin, but to make life
                      bright and joyous and beautiful with the love of Christ—like the
                      flowers, to gladden other lives by the ministry of love."—
                      Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p.97.
                         The present world of sin is doomed to pay the wages of sin,
                      and that is destruction. Evil men are simply destroying them-
                      selves and the world in which they live.
                         When men forget God and His commandments, they forget
                      the only force that can hold the world together, the only means
                      by which happiness, well-being;and peace can be preserved,
                      and life itself maintained.
                         Man needs to learn that there is a God in heaven, and that he
                      owes allegiance to Him—an allegiance which he can neglect
                      only at the expense of his present well-being and eternal happi-
                      ness. To his Creator man's supreme homage is due. That fact
                      man must never forget. Forgetting it, he forgets himself, he
                      forgets others, he forgets the world in which he lives—and must
                      pay the price of his neglect. But neglecting righteousness and
                      God, man forfeits goodness and love, and only with these is it
                       possible for him to live forever.

Wonderful, Counsellor           LESSON 8                               ❑ Thursday
                                                                      November 22
           Part 5      What special counsel is given the Laodicean church?
     COUNSEL FOR
 LAST-DAY PEOPLE       "I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou
                     mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be
                     clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear;
                     and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see"
                     (Rev. 3:18).

                       The Christian does not need to be rich in this world's goods,
                     but he does have to have spiritual riches. The symbolism of gold
                     and raiment and eyesalve may be interpreted as follows: gold—
                     faith that works by love; white raiment—Christ's righteousness;
                     eyesalve—the ability, through the Spirit of God, to distinguish
                     between truth and error.

                       Why is it necessary for the Christian to be on his guard at all
                     times? Matt. 25:13.

                        God has given many details concerning the kind of people the
                     saints should be in order to be in readiness for His coming.
                     Some characteristics are as follows:
                        Vigilant (1 Peter 5:8). Jesus gave similar advice to Peter! (See
                     Matt. 26:41.)
                        Sober (1 Thess. 5:6). The daytime is a time to work, not to
                     sleep. (See John 9:4.)
                        Holy (2 Peter 3:11, 14). Jesus urged readiness too. (See Luke
                     12:35-38.)
                        Pure (1 John 3:3). Only the pure in heart can see God. (See
                     Matt. 5:8.)
                        Diligent (2 Peter 1:10, 11). Although we are called and chosen,
                     we must never cease to be careful lest we fall.
                        Obedient (Rev. 22:14). An alternate reading gives "wash their
                     robes." We need to have the robe of Christ's righteousness to
                     enter the kingdom.
                        Truthful (Rev. 21:27). "There shall in no wise enter into it any
                     thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or
                     maketh a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb's book of
                     life.
                        Confident (Heb. 10:35). There may be periods of waiting and
                     uncertainty, but our faith must remain firm.
                        Patient (Heb. 10:36, 37). Christ's coming is as certain as day
                     following night. Wait for it!
                        Overcoming (Rev. 2:7). The Christian is a faithful warrior for
                     Christ. Victory is assured.
                        Steadfast (Rev. 3:11).

                     than in earlier times?

           Part 6   What is a result of keeping God's commandments with all
     FRUITAGE OF one's heart?
   HEEDING GOD'S
        COUNSEL     "My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my
                  commandments: for length of days, and long life, and peace,
                  shall they add to thee" (Prov. 3:1, 2).

                      We seldom feel that the time has come to give up life. We want
                    to see the fruitage of our work or to see our children (and
                    grandchildren!) growing up.
                      Blessings are not accidents. They do not come from following
                    our own inclinations, but from following the counsel of God.
                      The Lord desires only good for His children. Sometimes this
                    good is accomplished by misfortune, illness, or pain. But often
                    when we forget God and turn aside from His directions and
                    counsel, we then lack the faith necessary to accept these as
                    being for our good.
                      God's Word is a volume of heavenly counsel given to guide us
                    and keep us, to bring victories out of defeats, to replace sorrow
                    with joy, and to change unrest into peace.
                      When God gives counsel, He often points out what the result
                    of obedience or disobedience will be.

                     How did God advise Israel of both blessings and curses?
                    Deut. 28:1, 15.

                     The world is full of opposites. There is a right and a wrong
                    way, a narrow and a broad path. We choose the way we go, and
                    we enjoy or suffer the consequences.

                      How may one be assured of knowing the right way? 2 Tim.
                    3:14, 15.

                      The one who follows the right road and honors God with all
                    that he has received can be assured of plenty. (See Prov. 3:9,
                    10.) In fact, he will receive guidance so as to continue in the right
                    way. (See Prov. 3:6.)

                      What was God's response to Judah when they did not walk
                    in the right road? What did they miss? Isa. 48:18.

                      In Isaiah 30:1-7 God's rebellious children who had taken
                    counsel, not with God but with Egypt, were informed of the
                    woes that would come upon them. Having turned to the
                    Pharaoh rather than to God for help, they would discover that
                    the result would only be shame, confusion, and reproach.

           Part 1      What does God want to do with the world?
  GOD'S THOUGHTS
  TOWARD SINNERS      "Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the
                     world" (John 1:29).

                       Throughout the Bible God is pictured as One who hates sin
                     but loves the sinner. He despises the wicked deeds men do but
                     retains His love for those who do them. It is His purpose to
                     destroy sin but to save the sinner. Everything He can do, He will
                     do to save sinners from the fate which is their due.

                       What illustrations does the psalmist use in Psalm 103: 8-14
                     to express God's great love for humankind?

                       What kind of thoughts does God have for His people? Jer.
                     29:11.

                        Man is totally unworthy of such love. When he sins, he is in
                     rebellion against God. Surely an individual guilty of the gross
                     misdeeds prompted by the evil heart of man deserves punish-
                     ment rather than pity. But God in His love offers forgiveness and
                     salvation that man does not deserve.
                       If God were not a God of compassion, there would be no hope
                     for sinners. The entire human race would face certain and utter
                     destruction, doomed to suffer the penalty justice requires for
                     sin. But there is hope, because the love and compassion of God
                     has found a means of satisfying His justice.
                        God looks on sinful man not as he is but as he should be,
                     might be, and will be, when redeemed from sin and rescued
                     from its deadly grip.
                        "We must not think of God only as a judge ready to pronounce
                     sentence against us. He hates sin; but from love to sinners He
                     gave Himself, in the person of Christ, that all who would might
                     be saved and have eternal blessedness in the kingdom of
                     glory."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 633.

                     the first advance. While you were in rebellion against Him, He

                                                                      November 26
            Part 2     How did God reveal Himself to Moses?
     GOD'S MERCY
  TOWARD SINNERS       "The Lord God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and
                     abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for
                     thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and
                     that will by no means clear the guilty." (Ex. 34:6, 7).

                        God is a God of both mercy and justice. Justice demands that
                     the transgressor pay the penalty of his transgression. Death is
                     that penalty. So if justice alone were to prevail, all would die, for
                     all have sinned. There would be no other alternative.
                        God, however, is merciful, and His mercy makes it possiblefor
                     the condemned sinner to live. Justice could not be sacrificed,
                     for the requirements of justice must be met. God, in Jesus, paid
                     the penalty for all who repent of their sins and accept Jesus as
                     their Substitute. All others are guilty and pay the penalty them-
                     selves.
                        God's mercy is great, but His justice is real. If man refuses to
                     accept the provisions made for his salvation, God will demand
                     full justice, for He will not "clear the guilty."
                        We owe it to ourselves and to God to keep ever in mind His
                     wonderful goodness and mercy that makes possible the salva-
                     tion of all repentant sinners. The biblical writers keep such
                     pictures of Him constantly before us.

                       Why is it safe to turn to the Lord in time of difficulty, and also
                     after we have sinned? Deut. 4:29-31; 2 Chron. 30:9.

                       What truth points out the mercy of God? Rom. 5:8.

                       What good advice is recorded by Isaiah in regard to our
                     relationship to God? Isa. 55:6-9.

                        "More and more, as the days go by, it is becoming apparent
                     that God's judgments are in the world. . . . He is warning the
                     inhabitants of this earth of His near approach....
                           . . The time of God's destructive judgments is the time of
                     mercy for those who have had no opportunity to learn what is
                     truth. Tenderly will the Lord look upon them. His heart of mercy
                     is touched; His hand is still stretched out to save, while the door
                     is closed to those who would not enter."—Testimonies, vol. 9, p.
                     97.

                     be their fate?

            Part 3     What is the measure of God's love?
HEAVEN'S SACRIFICE
     FOR SINNERS       "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son,
                     that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have
                     everlasting life" (John 3:16).

                        Man was not redeemed from sin without a high price being
                     paid for his redemption. It cost the Father His Son, and it cost
                     the Son His life, His crown, His all. Jesus was the Lamb that was
                     slain.
                       Both Father and Son knew what the price would be and
                     weighed the cost. Jesus, at "the counsel of peace" with His
                     Father, volunteered to give up His own life for the life of the
                     sinner. "It was a struggle, even with the King of the universe, to
                     yield up His Son to die for the guilty race."—Patriarchs and
                     Prophets, p. 63.

                       What Old Testament patriarch knew what it was like to offer
                     his son as a sacrifice? Gen. 22:1,2. What was Jesus' comment
                     on this experience? John 8:56.

                        Some have been called upon to make the sacrifice of a son to
                     die for their country. It is not an easy experience. Some parents
                     would rather die and have their children live. But the supreme
                     sacrifice becomes the measure of supreme love and devotion.
                     Are we willing to respond to God in the same way as He has
                     responded to us?
                        For the Son "this was a voluntary sacrifice. Jesus might have
                     remained at the Father's side. He might have retained the glory
                     of heaven, and the homage of the angels. But He chose to give
                     back the scepter into the Father's hands, and to step down from
                     the throne of the universe, that He ,might bring light to the
                     benighted, and life to the perishing."—The Desire of Ages,
                     pp. 22, 23.
                        Before Jesus came to earth, He knew what suffering, humilia-
                     tion, and shame it would bring. He knew that He would be
                     despised and rejected of men; insulted, spat upon, treated as
                     the vilest of criminals, and die upon the cross. But He was
                     willing to pay the price.
                        The sacrifice made by Christ is likened to that of an innocent
                     lamb placed upon an altar. Until Christ came in person to offer
                     Himself upon the cross, the system of sacrifices kept ever be-
                     fore the repentant sinners the high price their salvation would
                     cost.

THINK IT THROUGH       Which was a harder experience to bear, the Father giving
                     the Son, or the Son offering Himself for the salvation of men?

                                                                 November 28
          Part 4     What great truth is taught in Isaiah 53:5, 6?
  MAN'S SINS ON
THE LAMB OF GOD      "He was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised
                   for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon
                   him; and with his stripes we are healed. All we like sheep have
                   gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and
                   the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all" (Isa. 53:5, 6).

                     When Christ died on the cross, He died not as a holy God but
                   as a sinful man. He died not because He Himself had sinned, but
                   because He had taken upon Himself the sins of others which did
                   not belong to Him.
                     When Christ died, He died as the worst of criminals, making
                   full atonement for all the sins of all the world.
                     There was no other way for man's redemption than for Him
                   who knew no sin to suffer its punishment.

                     What are the results of Christ's sacrifice on the cross?
                   1 Peter 2:24.

                     "Christ was treated as we deserve, that we might be treated as
                   He deserves. He was condemned for our sins, in which He had
                   no share, that we might be justified by His righteousness, in
                   which we had no share. He suffered the death which was ours,
                   that we might receive the life which was His. 'With His stripes we
                   are healed.' "—The Desire of Ages, p. 25.

                     What piercing cry points up the agony of Christ on the
                   cross? Matt. 27:46.

                      God could never forsake His beloved, sinless Son; but He who
                   was holy could not accept that which was evil. The sins of the
                   ages resting on Christ brought separation between Him and His
                   Father as He died for sin.
                      "The Saviour could not see through the portals of the tomb.
                   Hope did not present to Him His coming forth from the grave a
                   conqueror, or tell Him of the Father's acceptance of the sac-
                   rifice. He feared that sin was so offensive to God that Their
                   separation was to be eternal. Christ felt the anguish which the
                   sinner will feel when mercy shall no longer plead for the guilty
                   race. It was the sense of sin, bringing the Father's wrath upon
                   Him as man's substitute, that made the cup He drank so bitter,
                   and broke the heart of the Son of God."—The Desire of Ages, p.

                                                                       November 29
              Part 5     What must man have in order to be justified?
       THE GOD WHO
           JUSTIFIES     "Being justified by faith, we have peace with God through
                       our Lord Jesus Christ" (Rom. 5:1).

                          Sinners are not at peace with God, but at enmity. Sin fights
                       against God, rebels against conformity to His law and His will.
                       Death is the penalty for sin. Christ came into the world, however,
                       to rescue man from the penalty of death and to restore him to
                       peace with God. Love He offers for enmity, pardon for condem-
                       nation, reconciliation for alienation.
                         All this is what is meant by justification. A person is accepted,
                       not because of what he has done for God, but because of what
                       God has done for him. Justification is accomplished in a
                       moment—the first moment that man accepts the salvation
                       Christ offers him. It changes man's standing before the judg-
                       ment bar of heaven. His sins are pardoned, and he is accepted
                       as a member of the family of heaven, in peaceful and happy
                       relationship with God. All this is achieved by faith in Christ and
                       an acceptance of His ways.
                         "God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world;
                       but that the world through him might be saved" (John 3:17).
                       Justification is the opposite of condemnation, and Christ's pur-
                       pose was to justify, not to condemn.

                         What is a false road to justification? Gal. 2:16.

                          We are "justified freely," we are told, "through the redemp-
                       tion that is in Christ" (Rom. 3:24). "Whom he called, them he
                       also justified (Rom. 8:30). Sinners are justified by Christ im-
                       mediately when they accept Him—there is no waiting until
                       sainthood has been achieved.
                          "We have no righteousness of our own with which to meet the
                       claims of the law of God. But Christ has made a way of escape
                       for us. He lived on earth amid trials and temptations such as we
                       have to meet. He lived a sinless life. He died for us, and now He
                       offers to take our sins and give us His righteousness. If you give
                       yourself to Him, and accept Him as your Saviour, then, sinful as
                       your life may have been, for His sake you are accounted righ-
                       teous. Christ's character stands in place of your character, and
                       you are accepted before God just as if you had not sinned."—
                       Steps to Christ, p. 62.

                         Contrast the disobedience of one man, Adam, with the
                       obedience of one man, Christ. Rom. 5:18, 19.

         Part 6   What does Paul pray will be the experience of every be-
   THE GOD WHO liever?
     SANCTIFIES
                  "The very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God
                your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless
                unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ" (1 Thess. 5:23).

                     The effect of sin is to destroy the image of God in man. The
                   effect of the gospel is to restore man to God's image. The
                   purpose of Christ in coming to the world was to reveal God's
                   character to men, to die for their sins, and to make it possible by
                   His grace that this character might be reproduced in them. If
                   man is to live eternally in a holy heaven with a holy God, he must
                   be holy. (See Heb. 12:14.) The transformation from sinfulness to
                   holiness is called sanctification.

                     What does Jesus suggest as the way by which a person can
                   be sanctified? John 17:17.

                     "It is the work of conversion and sanctification to reconcile
                   men to God by bringing them into accord with the principles of
                   His law."—The Great Controversy, p. 467.
                     The holy law of God will be written in the hearts of the saved.
                   This process is sanctification.

                     What will be the prayer of the man who desires to be
                   sanctified? Ps. 51:10.

                     Man must learn to do right, not only because he is told to do
                   so, but because he wants to do so. To do works of righteousness
                   and holiness must become desirable for him. He will obey be-
                   cause it will be in harmony with his renewed nature to obey. The
                   thoughts of God are to become his thoughts, and the ways of
                   God, his ways. This is the work of sanctification.

                     What did Jesus say He did for our sakes in order that we may
                   be sanctified? John 17:19.

                      This work is not accomplished in a moment. It is the work of a
                   lifetime. Nowhere in this life will it be possible for man to say that
                   he is perfectly holy, completely like God. He is saved in heaven
                   not by his own holiness or his own works of righteousness but
                   by the grace of God and the righteousness of Christ which is
                   imputed to him.

                                              The purpose of the lesson this week
                                           is to see how the God of heaven is the
                                           personal God of His children on earth.
                                           From the time of Adam to the present
                                           there have always been men who
                                            knew God as their Saviour from sin,
                                           Deliverer from evil, and their Guide
                                           and Companion in daily life. There is
                                            nothing more important in life than to
                                            become acquainted with God as a
                                            personal friend.

                                                                         December 2
               Part 1     How does God relate to those who fear Him?
            GOD AND
          HIS SAINTS      "They that feared the Lord spake often one to another: and
                        the Lord hearkened and heard it, and a book of remembrance
                        was written before him for them that feared the Lord, and that
                        thought upon his name. And they shall be mine, saith the Lord
                        of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare
                        them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him" (Mal.
                        3:16, 17).

                          There are people on earth who fear God, who speak to each
                        other concerning Him, and who worship Him together. The
                        Bible calls them saints. God recognizes them as His own, and
                        they recognize Him. He loves them and they love Him. They are
                        called His children. They have fellowship with each other and
                        with God. Very close and tender is this relationship.
                          The picture of God that Malachi presents is of One who keeps
                        careful records. None will be forgotten, because their names
                        are written in a book. (See also Ex. 32:32, 33.) Only the unrigh-
                        teous will have their names blotted out of the book of life (Ps.
                        69:28). Those whose names are written in the book will be
                        delivered from all evil (Dan. 12:1).

                          How should the saints relate to one another? Heb. 10:24, 25.

                           If any people on earth deserve to associate themselves closely
                        together in bonds of happy and meaningful fellowship, it is the
                        saints of God. They did this in Old Testament times, and also
                        after the Saviour came to earth. They enjoy this fellowship and
                        profit from it. God watches over them in this fellowship and
                        blesses them in it.
                           The saints are not to fix their eyes on themselves and their
                        own affairs; they are to look at the needs of those around them
                        and to encourage everyone to be more loving and more active in
                        good deeds. Saints are not to be concerned only with personal
                        salvation, but also with the salvation of others. This means
                        faithful attendance at meetings where they can encourage one
                        another and give public testimony to their unity and common
                        faith. This becomes more important in Christian life as the
                        second advent approaches.

                          What should be the attitude of those that love the Lord? Ps.
                        97:10-12.

THINK IT THROUGH          Why do some people absent themselves from Sabbath
                        School and the church service? What are some of the benefits
                        of faithful attendance at services?

My Father and My God          LESSON 10                               ❑ Monday
                                                                     December 3
          Part 2     Why and for what purpose did God choose Israel?
        GOD AND
     HIS PEOPLE      "Thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God: the Lord thy
                   God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself,
                   above all people that are upon the face of the earth. The Lord
                   did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye
                   were more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest
                   of all people: but because the Lord loved you, and because he
                   would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers,
                   hath the Lord brought you out with a mighty hand, and re-
                   deemed you out of the house of bondmen, from the hand of
                   Pharaoh king of Egypt" (Deut. 7:6-8).

                      God wants a people who are different from other people,
                   different in the sense that they will have nothing to do with false
                   gods and false worship. They will not do anything to com-
                   promise their relation to God by making alliances or intermarry-
                   ing with the heathen (verses 2, 3). They remember this covenant
                   relationship with God and walk humbly before Him.
                      Lest God's people become proud of their special position and
                   the blessings they enjoy, God reminds them that they are cho-
                   sen, not for any qualities of their own, but merely because of
                   God's love (verse 8). Whatever we enjoy of earth's bounties, it is
                   only because of God's goodness and love.

                     What qualities of Abraham qualified him to be the father of
                   the faithful? Gen. 12:1-4, 7, 8; 13:4, 14-18; 14:20; 15:6; 18:17-19.

                     Abraham believed God, and this was counted to him for righ-
                   teousness. But it was God who took the initiative in calling him
                   and making great promises to him. He obeyed the Lord. Wher-
                   ever he went, He set up altars to worship God. He paid tithe.
                   Abraham was not perfect. He failed to give a proper witness in
                   Egypt (Gen. 12:10-20). But God was with him because he did not
                   stagger at God's promises.
                     What the world knows of God today, it knows very largely
                   because of Hebrews who knew God and did not want the world
                   to forget Him. Among them were such individuals as Moses,
                   David, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and many others. Their witness for
                   God, made known by Christian endeavor and missions, has
                   carried a knowledge of Him throughout the world.

                     What assurance do we have that God will help us as His
                   people? Isa. 41:8-10; 43:5-7, 10.

THINK IT THROUGH     From the experience of Israel, how can you show that God's
                   choice of a people does not necessarily mean that the people
                   will remain His own?

              Part 3     What was the psalmist's personal relationship to God?
           GOD AND
     THE INDIVIDUAL     "I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress: my
                       God; in him will I trust" (Ps. 91:2).
                           The fact that God is a wonderful God to others profits me little
                       unless I know that He is also a God to me. The God of the Bible
                       and the preacher, the God of David or Moses or John, means
                       little to me unless I also know Him.
                           What good does it do me when I hear of answers to others'
                       prayers and know not that God also answers mine? What good
                       does it do me when others testify that God is near and dear if I
                       cannot offer such a testimony myself?
                           The saints of the Bible and the saints of today know God for
                       themselves. David could say, "The Lord is my shepherd; / shall
                       not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he
                       leadeth me beside still waters. He restoreth my soul" (Ps. 23:
                       1-3). (Emphasis supplied.)

                         What words in the following passages of Scripture indicate
                       a personal relationship with God? Ps. 23:1-3; Job 19:25-27;
                       2 Tim. 1:12; 4:8.
                          David had been a shepherd caring for sheep and the lambs.
                       As he thought of himself and his relation to God, he could not
                       think of a better illustration than that of God as the Great
                       Shepherd. Can you think of a modern occupation in an urban
                       society which would parallel that of a shepherd? Would he be a
                       banker, a lawyer, a guardian, a trustee? How do these occupa-
                       tions fail to fulfill the qualities of a shepherd?

                        Where did Isaiah have a personal encounter with God, and
                       what were the results? Isa. 6:1-13.
                         All the wonderful things God has done for others He desires
                       and has promised to do for me. What I must do is to allow the
                       eyes of my spiritual vision to be opened and to respond to God
                       when He addresses me.

                         What words in the following texts indicate that a personal
                       relationship with God is open to all? Rev. 3:20-22; John 1:9;
                       Rom. 1:16.
                         What is the secret of experiencing the reality of God's pres-
                       ence? Jer. 29:13.

THINK IT THROUGH         What are the things that hinder my enjoying a personal
                       experience with God?
                         If we do not know God, it is because we do not believe or
                       receive Him, or because we drive Him away by our sins.

My Father and My God           LESSON 10                          ❑ Wednesday
                                                                   December 5
           Part 4     What kind of people find that God is near to them?
   THE NEARNESS
         OF GOD       "The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that
                    call upon him in truth" (Ps. 145:18).

                       The expression "to call upon" the Lord means to worship
                    Him, to recognize His strength and man's dependence. Man is
                    always in need of help. To whom shall he turn in his need? He
                    may be tempted to turn to his fellowman or even to one who
                    holds a high station in life. But the psalmist warns against this.
                    (See Ps. 118:8, 9.) There is only One to whom a man can turn and
                    find his needs amply supplied.
                       The challenge to the worshiper is that his worship shall be "in
                    truth"—in sincerity and singleness of heart. The Christian must
                    never divide his loyalty or fail in trust and confidence. Some-
                    times the Christian is tempted to put his trust in a bank balance,
                    or in friends, in his skill, or astuteness. It seems easier to have
                    confidence in what can be seen and felt, rather than in God who
                    is invisible and apparently intangible. But a faith that is the
                    "evidence of things not seen" (Heb. 11:1) must actuate him in all
                    his relations with God, and then he can be sure God will never
                    let him down.

                     How did Moses encourage the children of Israel that God
                    would keep on leading them? Deut. 31:6.

                      The Lord used similar language to strengthen Joshua
                    (Joshua 1:5, 6).

                      Under what circumstance did Jesus say that He and the
                    Father would make Their abode with men? John 14:23.

                      Does God mean what He says? Will He be true to His word?
                    But why does He so often repeat His promises? Do times ever
                    come when we personally need it?

                      Nothing that in any way concerns our peace is too small for
                    Him [God] to notice. There is no chapter in our experience too
                    dark for Him to read; there is no perplexity too difficult for Him

                                                                      December 6
            Part 5     What reveals the goodness of God?
     THE GOODNESS
           OF GOD      "0 taste and see that the Lord is good: blessed is the man
                     that trusteth in him. 0 fear the Lord, ye his saints: for there is
                     no want to them that fear him. The young lions do lack, and
                     suffer hunger: but they that seek the Lord shall not want any
                     good thing" (Ps. 34:8-10).
                        The goodness of God is revealed in that He provides man with
                     everything he really needs. "Taste and see," says the psalmist.
                     He invites us to experience God's abundant provision. Nothing
                     is more convincing than experience—being in that situation
                     where only God can be the source of our supplies. We are
                     always afraid of being without our daily needs. But when cir-
                     cumstances take away every visible means of support, and we
                     find that God has supplied every need, then we are tasting how
                     good God is. Happy is that man whose trust in God has not been
                     in vain.
                        The imagery of the lion going hungry is very striking. Can the
                     king of beasts with all his strength go hungry? Yes, he can, says
                     the psalmist. But those who trust in God will never find them-
                     selves without necessities. Their lot is better than that of the
                     most naturally privileged.

                       In view of the goodness of God, how should man respond?
                     Ps. 107:8, 9; 105:1, 2.
                       How many are the blessings of God! But how sparse are
                     man's expressions of praise! How measureless is the love and
                     goodness of God, but how feeble the gratitude in the heart of
                     man! If God is good, why not recognize it and thank Him for it? If
                     we enjoy blessings from Heaven, why not lift up our voices in
                     grateful praise?
                       As we look at the world about us, how much can we see there
                     of the goodness of God—in nature and in the heart of men? All
                     goodness everywhere has its origin with God. Men are good
                     only because God is good. Every deed of kindness, every act of
                     mercy, every thought of compassion is only a reflection of the
                     goodness and love of God.

                       Where can we see evidences of God's goodness? Ps.
                     145:9-12.

THINK IT THROUGH       How can the Christian see the goodness of God even in
                     calamitous circumstances?
                       "God never leads His children otherwise than they would
                     choose to be led, if they could see the end from the beginning,
                     and discern the glory of the purpose which they are fulfilling as

                                                                      December 7

            Part 6     What does Romans 8:38 and 39 teach about God's love?
  INVINCIBLE LOVE
                       "I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor
                     principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to
                     come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be
                     able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ
                     Jesus our Lord" (Rom. 8:38, 39).

                       Paul goes from one extreme to the other, from death to life,
                     from height to depth, and he finds that there is absolutely
                     nothing that can oppose the love of God and make it ineffective
                     in reaching man. God's love, like Himself, is an invincible, im-
                     penetrable power that can surround us so that no evil can reach
                     us, no superhuman effort can ever snatch us out of its grasp. In
                     God's love we are absolutely safe.
                        God's invincible love can never fail. Neither sin nor Satan can
                     stop it. When Satan caused men to sin, he hoped God's hatred
                     for sin would turn into hatred for man and result in his complete
                     destruction. But instead of destroying man, God gave His Son to
                     save Him.

                      What comparison does Paul make between man's love and
                     God's love? Rom. 5:6-8.

                       In innumerable ways God has continued to demonstrate His
                     love for the human race. Every child of earth has been a recip-
                     ient of that love. In every age God has given new assurances and
                     demonstrations of His love.

                       With what human illustration does God indicate that He
                     cannot forget His people? Isa. 49:15.

                        The context of verse 15 indicates that God's people have
                     sometimes felt forgotten and even forsaken. They have passed
                     through periods when it looked as though they were at the
                     mercy of adverse circumstances. They have prayed for deliver-
                     ance, but God has not effected any changes. Is there any hope
                     for them?
                        But God says that He has not forgotten His people. It is more
                     likely for a mother to forget her infant child than for God to be
                     unmindful of His people.
                        God's ways are not our ways, just as His thoughts are not our
                     thoughts. (See Isa. 55:8, 9.) God is ever constant. In His good
                     time and in His good way He will work for His people. We must
                     be patient, ever trusting, ever believing, knowing that God is
                     working out His purposes for our good.

 THINK IT THROUGH      What do the assurances given to ancient Israel of God's
                     everlasting love mean to us today?

             Part 1     What creatures and how many does John see around the
     ANGELS ABOUT     throne of God?
     GOD'S THRONE
                        "As I looked I heard the voices of countless angels. These
                      were all round the throne and the living creatures and the
                      elders. Myriads upon myriads there were, thousands upon
                      thousands" (Rev. 5:11, NEB).

                         Heaven is the headquarters of the universe. There God is
                      seated on His throne. God is infinitely great, and the universe is
                      infinitely large. Its work must be one of almost unbelievable
                      complexity. It is through angels that God conducts His work.
                      There are untold numbers of them, "myriads upon myriads"
                      and "thousands upon thousands."
                         God's work for the world is of great importance, to Him and to
                      every one of us, whether sinner or saint. Every detail is closely
                      watched. Not a sparrow in this little earth of ours falls to the
                      ground without His notice. No king rules, no saint falls, without
                      God's being aware of it.
                         Angels keep all the extremely complex and mutually interwo-
                      ven affairs of earth under Heaven's control. In Ezekiel 1:15-21
                      and' 10:9-16 the seemingly chaotic array of worldly affairs is
                      likened to four wheels kept under the control of four living
                      creatures, cherubim, who in turn are under the direction of God
                      seated upon His throne. (See Eze. 1:26, 28; 10:1, 5, 18-20.)

                       Whom did Jacob see working for God on behalf of men?
                      Gen. 28:12.

                         David spoke of God's "throne in the heavens" and of His
                      kingdom which "ruleth over all," with His "angels that excel in
                      strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the
                      voice of his word," the "ministers of his, that do his pleasure"
                      (Ps. 103:19-21). Micaiah saw "the Lord sitting on his throne, and
                      all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on
                      his left" (1 Kings 22:19).
                         Daniel beheld the Ancient of Days seated on His throne which
                      appeard "like the fiery flame" (Dan. 7:9, 10).

                         Who does Peter mention as being interested in man's salva-
                      tion? 1 Peter 1:10-12.

                        These things which mortal eyes cannot see are just as real
                      and infinitely more important than the visible things of earth.
                      The Bible draws the curtain aside and helps us to glimpse the
                      close connection between heaven and earth.

     OF CHRIST
                  "The Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with
                his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to
                his works" (Matt. 16:27).

                     The angels of heaven are the attendants of Christ and are
                   under His command. When Satan rebelled and was cast to
                   earth, a majority of the angels remained loyal to Christ. (See
                   Rev. 12:4, 7, 8.)
                     Since the first rebellion, all the loyal angelic host has been
                   closely connected with Christ in continued warfare against the
                   dragon. In the conduct of the work of Heaven many activities
                   involve the entire universe, but none are of greater importance
                   than those having to do with the winning back to God this world
                   which Satan seeks to hold. The angels are closely connected
                   with Christ in the conduct of this work, ever anxious to be sent

                      "All these heavenly beings have one object above all others,
                   in which they are intensely interested—His church in a world of
                   corruption. All these armies are in the service of the Prince of
                   heaven, exalting the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sins of
                   the world. They are working for Christ under His commission, to
                   save to the uttermost all who look to Him and believe in

            Part 3     What is the function of angels in relation to man?
 ANGELIC MINISTRY
          TO MEN       "Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for
                     them who shall be heirs of salvation?" (Heb. 1:14).

                       Angels have their homes in heaven, but they are often on
                     earth. They are at the command of Jesus to serve man. They
                     bring the blessings of heaven to the needy of earth. They con-
                     nect man in his weakness with God in His strength.

                       What did Jesus say was one of God's provisions for "little
                     ones"? Matt. 18:10.

                        "Little ones" may not only be children. They could very well
                     be those who are weak in the faith. God is very much concerned
                     about the safety of everyone, especially those who are not able
                     to care for themselves. (See Ps. 91:11, 12.)
                        "Angels of glory that do always behold the face of the Father
                     in heaven, joy in ministering to His little ones. Angels are ever
                     present when they are most needed, with those who have the
                     hardest battles with self to fight, and whose surroundings are
                     the most discouraging. Weak and trembling souls who have
                     many objectionable traits of character are their special
                     charge."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 105.

                       How did an angel release Peter from prison? Acts 12:7-10.

                       How did the same angel bring death to Herod? Verse 23.

                       "The same angel who had come from the royal courts to
                     rescue Peter, had been the messenger of wrath and judgment to
                     Herod. The angel smote Peter to arouse him from slumber; it
                     was with a different stroke that he smote the wicked king, laying
                     low his pride and bringing upon him the punishment of the
                     Almighty. Herod died in great agony of mind and body under the
                     retributive judgment of God."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 152.

                       "Angels are constantly ascending and descending this ladder
                     of shining brightness, bearing the prayers of the needy and
                     distressed to the Father above, and bringing blessing and hope,
                     courage and help, to the children of men. These angels of light
                     create a heavenly atmosphere about the soul, lifting us toward

                                                                   December 12
           Part 4     What good news did an angel bring to shepherds in a field
     BEARERS OF     by night?
    GOOD TIDINGS
                       "There were in the same country shepherds abiding in the
                    field, keeping watch over their flock by night. And, lo, the angel
                    of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone
                    round about them: and they were sore afraid. And the angel
                    said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings
                    of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born
                    this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord"
                    (Luke 2:8-11).

                      The most important news that has ever come to the world was
                    the announcement that the birth of the Saviour of the world had
                    taken place. The tidings were entrusted to an angel and were
                    announced to the humble shepherds of Bethlehem.

                      What other instances are recorded of angels communicat-
                    ing important messages for God?

                      Both Joseph (Matt. 1:21) and Paul (Acts 27:22-24) received
                    divine instruction by means of an angel messenger.
                      "Heaven and earth are no wider apart today than when
                    shepherds listened to the angels' song. Humanity is still as
                    much the object of heaven's solicitude as when common men of
                    common occupations met angels at noonday, and talked with
                    the heavenly messengers in the vineyards and the fields. To us
                    in the common walks of life, heaven may be very near. Angels
                    from the courts above will attend the steps of those who come
                    and go at. God's commands."—The Desire of Ages, p. 48.
                       The apostle Paul represents what every missionary can be by
                    God's grace, a means of bringing hope and courage to those
                    who do not know God. Paul, on the ship that was scheduled to
                    take them to Italy, suffered physically like anyone else. But he
                    had one privilege that few could share.
                       How grateful men should be for our wonderful God who
                    sends His angelic messengers with news for the children of
                    earth from His seemingly unreachable heaven!

            Part 5     What agents did God use for the destruction of Sodom?
MESSAGES OF DOOM
                       "There came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in
                     the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet
                     them."
                       "The men said unto Lot, . . . We will destroy this place,
                     because the cry of them Is waxen great before the face of the
                     Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it" (Gen. 19:1, 12,
                     13).

                        Not all the missions of angels bring happiness and blessing.
                     At times angels are sent by God with messages of judgment or
                     doom. Thus it was with Sodom. Because of its iniquity, God saw
                     fit to withdraw His protection and mercy, and the city met its
                     doom. Angels carried out His purpose. At the same time angels
                     were working to save Lot and his family. Their patience and
                     insistence is an example of how God is anxious to save us from
                     the destruction of this world.

                       How did an angel destroy the efficacy of a great army?
                     2 Chron. 32:20, 21.

                         "The God of the Hebrews had prevailed over the proud Assyr-
                     ian. The honor of Jehovah was vindicated in the eyes of the
                     surrounding nations. In Jerusalem the hearts of the people were
                     filled with holy joy. Their earnest entreaties for deliverance had
                     been mingled with confession of sin and with many tears. In
                     their great need they had trusted wholly in the power of God to
                     save, and He had not failed them."—Prophets and Kings, pp.
                     361, 362.

                       What part did an angel have in punishing Jerusalem?
                     1 Chron. 21:14, 15.

                      Of the three options, David chose to fall into the hands of God.
                     He knew that God was just, but also merciful (verse 13).

                       What terrible judgMents fall on the earth when seven angels
                     pour out seven vials containing God's wrath? Rev. 16.

                       It must never be thought that wicked men or a wicked world
                     are beyond the judgment of God. When iniquity is carried to a
                     point beyond which Heaven can no longer permit, angels of
                     judgment are sent to withdraw God's protecting mercies and to
                     permit evil to reap the bitter harvest it has sown.

    CONTROLLING
       AGENCIES      "I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth,
                   holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not
                   blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree" (Rev. 7:1).

                      This view is of vital import to the world today. It is a simple
                   statement of a very important fact. Angels unseen by men are
                   commissioned by God to hold in check throughout the earth
                   powers which could prematurely explode into outbreaks which
                   would engulf the entire world in final destruction. Satan incites
                   men everywhere to outbursts of wrath and violence. But angels
                   from God hold them in check. Had it not been for the restraining
                   activities of the angels, earth's troubles would long since have
                   erupted into conflicts that would have ended only in Armaged-

                   sealed; but when God shall bid His angels loose the winds, there

                     "God did not prevent Daniel's enemies from casting him into
                   the lions' den; He permitted evil angels and wicked men thus far
                   to accomplish their purpose; but it was that He might make the
                   deliverance of His servant more marked, and the defeat of the
                   enemies of truth and righteousness more complete."—
                   Prophets and Kings, pp. 543, 544.
                     "From the story of Daniel's deliverance we may learn that in
                   seasons of trial and gloom God's children should be just what
                   they were when their prospects were bright with hope and their
                   surroundings all that they could desire. Daniel in the lion's den
                   was the same Daniel who stood before the king as chief among
                   the ministers of state and as a prophet of the Most High. A man
                   whose heart is stayed upon God will be the same in the hour of
                   his greatest trial as he is in prosperity, when the light and favor
                   of God and of man beam upon him. Faith reaches to the unseen,

                                                                       December 16
              Part 1     What was Paul's view of God's power to help?
       GOD'S GREAT
     POWER TO HELP       "Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly
                       above all that we ask or think, according to the power that
                       worketh in us" (Eph. 3:20).

                          When we want someone to do something for us, we go to
                       someone who is able to do it. If we want a watch repaired, a
                       motor fixed, a house built, we go to someone with competence.
                       When we need help, the part of wisdom is always to go to
                       someone who is able to help.
                          We are conditioned to think that, in these days of scientific
                       progress, there is no limit to what science can do. We talk of the
                       miracles of medicine and technology. We think that all we need
                       to do is to invest more money and time and the answers will be
                       found. But the fact is that man is limited by time and conditioned
                       by his environment. With all his efforts and skill he faces death
                       and the end of the world. If he is wise, he will look beyond the
                       immediate and recognize a God who is there to help, and there
                       is no limit to what He can do.
                         Do we fear the power of wicked men or nations? "Behold the
                       nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small
                       dust of the balance" (Isa. 40:15).

                         What was Paul's attitude to his weakness? Why? 2 Cor. 12:9.

                         Do you doubt your ability to meet the requirements God has
                       set for those who are to live with Him in glory? Commit yourself
                       "unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present
                       you faultless before the presence of his glory" (Jude 24).

                        What gift did Isaiah assure Israel they could receive from
                       God? Isa. 40:28-31.

                         To "wait upon the Lord" is not simply to do nothing. It is to
                       look to God for guidance and strength. In Him and not in our-
                       selves is the secret of success in our struggles with ourselves,
                       with our environment, and with the task that God has given us to
                       do.
                         Does the church feel that Christ's command to give the gos-
                       pel to all nations is too great a task? Let it recall His promise:
                       "Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world." "All
                       power is given unto me in heaven and in earth" (Matt. 28:20, 18).

THINK IT THROUGH         Why is it that God can use us better in our weaknesses?

The God of Help         LESSON 12                                      ❑ Monday
                                                                     December 17
           Part 2   Why does God say we need not be afraid in any cir-
GOD'S WILLINGNESS cumstance?
         TO HELP
                    "Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am
                  thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will
                  uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness" (Isa.
                  41:10).

                       Every child of God may have implicit confidence in God's
                     willingness to help and in His ability and purpose to strengthen
                     and uphold. His one thought toward His children is always to
                     help them. As a mother loves her child and would make any
                     sacrifice in its behalf, so with God.

                       How certain was the psalmist that God would provide for
                     him? Ps. 27:10.

                       Home ties are usually very strong. They give us a sense of
                     security. It is frightening to be thrown out into the world. But
                     God is always mindful of our needs. (See Mark 10:29, 30.)
                       God loves His children with a love that is guided by His
                     wisdom and His desire to help. Our desires and prayers are not
                     always commensurate with His goodness, wisdom, and love.
                       "God is too wise and good to answer our prayers always at
                     just the time and in just the manner we desire. He will do more
                     and better for us than to accomplish all our wishes. And be-
                     cause we can trust His wisdom and love, we should not ask Him
                     to concede to our will, but should seek to enter into and ac-
                     complish His purpose. Our desires and interests should be lost
                     in His will."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 231.

                       What assurance may we have concerning the watchcare of
                      God? Ps. 121:4-7.

                         "In His loving care and interest in us, often He who under-
                      stands us better than we understand ourselves refuses to permit
                      us selfishly to seek the gratification of our own ambition. He
                      does not permit us to pass by the homely but sacred duties that
                      lie next to us. Often these duties afford the very training essen-
                      tial to prepare us for a higher work. Often our plans fail that
                      God's plans for us may succeed.. ..
                         "In the future life the mysteries that here have annoyed and
                      disappointed us will be made plain. We shall see that our seem-
                      ingly unanswered prayers and disappointed hopes have been
                      among our greatest blessings."—The Ministry of Healing, pp.
                      473, 474.

 THINK IT THROUGH       If God is always for us, why do events so often appear to be
                      against us?

               Part 3    Why, according to the psalmist, is it not necessary for a
           GOD, THE     Christian to be afraid? Ps. 27:1-5.
         PROTECTOR
      OF HIS PEOPLE       The Christian sometimes passes through days of darkness
                        and uncertainty. But the Lord is his light, showing him clearly
                        the way he ought to go.
                          Does he sometimes feel that the whole world is against him?
                        Perhaps! But he has no reason to fear the outcome. With God
                        our Helper on our side, victory is certain.
                          Children of God have enemies, but they need not fear them.
                        Every man who endeavors to do right has the forces of evil
                        arrayed against him, but he need not live in terror. What he
                        needs is faith in God and the courage that comes with it. With
                        these he may have peace in his heart and victory in his life.

                          What may be the confidence of every child of God? Ps. 91:2.

                           Ellen White, commenting on Psalm 91, wrote: "The righteous
                         understand God's government, and will triumph with holy glad-
                        ness in the everlasting protection and salvation that Christ
                         through His merits has secured for them. Let all remember this,
                         and forget not that the wicked, who do not receive Christ as
                        their personal Saviour, understand not His providence."—Ellen
                        G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 1150.
                           "While Satan is constantly devising evil, the Lord our God
                        overrules all, so that it will not harm His obedient, trusting
                        children. The same power that controls the boisterous waves of
                        the ocean can hold in check all the power of rebellion."—Ellen
                        G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 1141.
                           If we are God's children, then our enemies are His enemies,
                        our battles His battles, and our weaknesses and shortcomings
                        are girded with His strength.
                           "He who slumbers not, who is continually at work for the
                        accomplishment of His designs, will carry forward His own
                        work. He will thwart the purposes of wicked men, and will bring
                        to confusion the counsels of those who plot mischief against
                        His people. He who is the King, the Lord of hosts, sitteth be-
                        tween the cherubim, and amid the strife and tumult of nations
                        He guards His children still. He who ruleth in the heavens is our
                        Saviour. He measures every trial, He watches the furnace fire
                        that must test every soul. When the strongholds of kings shall be
                        overthrown, when the arrows of wrath shall strike through the
                        hearts of His enemies, His people will be safe in His hands."—

The God of Help       LESSON 12                                   ❑ Wednesday
                                                                   December 19
         Part 4    "According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, fury to
 MANIFESTATIONS his adversaries, recompense to his enemies.... So shall they
 IN EMERGENCIES fear the name of the Lord from the west, and his glory from the
                rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in like a flood,
                the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up el standard against him" (Isa.
                59:18, 19).

                     We live in a world where those who endeavor to serve God
                   must expect manifestations of the power of the enemy and
                   reveal ings of the power of God. An alert enemy is ever at work,
                   ready at any moment to pounce upon and devour his prey. Left
                   to themselves alone, the children of God would be no match for
                   the relentless foe. But the battle is not theirs alone; it is God's.
                   The honor of God is at stake as well as the fate of His children. In
                   every crisis the Lord is with His people, ready to defend and
                   deliver. That was the situation with Israel at the Red Sea; with
                   the Jews in Persia in the days of Esther, Mordecai, and Haman;
                   and Elijah in the days of Ahab and Jezebel.

                     How effective is the wrath of man against the power of God?
                   Ps. 76:10.

                      At these times of greatest emergency God displays Himself in
                   His matchless majesty. Never are the wonders of our wonderful
                   God more magnificently revealed than when the saints are weak
                   and God shows Himself to be infinitely strong, when the enemy
                   is exerting himself to the utmost to destroy and God reveals
                   Himself to save. At such times the children of God know of
                   certainty that the Lord omnipotent is their God. The wicked also
                   are forced to admit that the Lord Jehovah is God, and that it is to
                   Him that all honor and praise is due.
                      "God has always wrought for His people in their greatest
                   extremity, when there seemed the least hope that ruin could be
                   averted. The designs of wicked men, the enemies of the church,
                   are subject to His power and overruling providence. He can
                   move upon the hearts of statesmen; the wrath of the turbulent
                   and disaffected, the haters of God, His truth, and His people can
                   be turned aside, even as the rivers of water are turned, if He
                   orders it thus. Prayer moves the arm of Omnipotence. He who
                   marshals the stars in order in the heavens, whose word controls
                   the waves of the great deep, the same infinite Creator will work
                   in behalf of His people if they call upon Him in faith."—

                   crisis where victory for the enemy appears to be inevitable?

The God of Help          LESSON 12                                      ❑ Thursday
                                                                       December 20
             Part 5     What does the psalmist say that God will do for us?
      GOD GUIDES
       HIS PEOPLE       "This God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide
                      even unto death" (Ps. 48:14).

                        Man, with the limitations of his knowledge and foresight, is
                      constantly in need of divine guidance. In His Word God has
                      repeatedly promised to guide His children, and we find there
                      many examples of those who have been guided by Him, such as
                      Abraham, Moses, David, Peter, John, and Paul.

                        How personal is God's guidance? Ps. 32:8.

                          Guidance with the eye is a close and intimate guidance. It is
                      more than giving instructions and leaving a person to carry
                      them out. It means watching the person continually to make
                      sure that every move is correct. It is the guidance that a father
                      would give a son, freely, willingly, and with a deep concern for
                      the son's best interest.
                          "There are three ways in which the Lord reveals His will to us.
                      ... God reveals His will to us in His word, the Holy Scriptures. His
                      voice is also revealed in His providential workings; and it will be
                      recognized if we do not separate our souls from Him by walking
                      in our own ways, doing according to our own wills, and follow-
                      ing the promptings of an unsanctified heart, until the senses
                      have become so confused that eternal things are not dis-
                      cerned, and the voice of Satan is so disguised that it is accepted

                         "Another way in which God's voice is heard is through the

                                                                    December 21
           Part 6     "The Lord is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble, and he
WORTHY OF TRUST     knoweth them that trust in him" (Nahum 1:7).

                       Can a man of little faith have a strong trust in God?
                       God's people have faith in God and place their trust in Him.
                    They live happily, sleep peacefully, and work successfully be-
                    cause of their trust in God.
                       Trusting God, God's children put His ways above their own
                    ways, His wisdom above theirs, His judgment above their own.
                    They accept His strength to replace their weakness, His perfec-
                    tion for their own shortcomings. All the resources of Heaven are
                    theirs who place their trust in God.
                       Man's judgment and knowledge are imperfect. But the man
                    who obeys God because he trusts Him accepts the wisdom and
                    ways of Him who has never made a mistake.
                       No one need ever be disappointed in placing implicit trust in
                    God. God always knows what is best and what will work out for
                    man's own good and the greater good of His cause on earth.
                    "No good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.
                    0 Lord of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee" (Ps.
                    84:11, 12).

                     What in man's experience contributes to lack of trust in
                    God? (See 2 Cor. 1:9; Heb. 3:12.)

                      Disbelief and sufficiency have ever stood as barriers to a
                    trusting relationship with God. However, there is no limit to
                    what a man may accomplish who goes forward with full confi-
                    dence in God and complete reliance on His strength. Thus it was
                    with Paul. "I can do all things through Christ which strength-
                    eneth me" (Phil. 4:13). Paul was well aware of his own weak-
                    nesses, but he was also acquainted with God's infinite strength
                    that was placed at his disposal.

                      What did trust in God mean to the psalmist? Ps. 118:5-9.

THINK IT THROUGH       Is trust in God important for the things of earth as well as for
                    the things of heaven? If I lack trust in God, how may I secure
                    it? If my faith is weak, is it possible that it may grow? Is there
                    any relationship between trust in God and obedience to His
                    commands?

                      "God will do great things for those who trust in Him. The
                    reason why His professed people have no greater strength is
                    that they trust so much to their own wisdom, and do not give the
                    Lord an opportunity to reveal His power in their behalf. He will
                    help His believing children in every emergency if they will place
                    their entire confidence in Him and faithfully obey Him."—Patri-

            Part 1      "The Lord is our judge, the Lord is our lawgiver, the Lord is
 THE LORD IS KING     our king; he will save us" (Isa. 33:22).

                        This text not only proclaims that God is King, but also de-
                     clares that He is Judge, Lawgiver, and Saviour.
                        This multifaceted aspect of the responsibilities of a king is not
                     true of many, if any, kings today. Most rulers have checks placed
                     on their powers. This seems to be necessary because of the
                     limitations of any man. But the Lord who is our King is able and
                     functions in these as well as other ways.

                       How did Abraham expect that the Judge of all the earth
                     should act? Gen. 18:25.

                       Note that it would be an injustice for the righteous to suffer
                     with the wicked. Note also that the wicked can be given extra
                     grace because of the presence of a few righteous people. Have
                     you thought that, when you are fully surrendered to God and
                     obedient to Him, your neighbors profit from your presence
                     among them?
                       God is not interested in condemning the world and destroy-
                     ing it (John 3:17). But when people refuse to accept God's
                     mercy, then punishment is inevitable.

                       What is the relation between judging and the law? James
                     4:11, 12.

                        A king could also be a savior to his people. He could protect
                     them from their enemies. Not all kings were always capable of
                     this. But our God is a King who will never fail to save those who
                     come to Him.

                       What did the children of Israel forget? Ps. 106:21.

                       Many of us have good "forgetters," but we should never
                     forget the way that God has led us in the past and His promises
                     for the future. (Read Psalm 103:1-6, where we are reminded of
                     the many blessings that God has bestowed upon us.)

THINK IT THROUGH       What is the relationship of law to Saviour as far as man Is
                     concerned?

                        "When man fell by transgression the law was not changed,
                     but a remedial system was established to bring him back to
                     obedience. The promise of a Saviour was given, and sacrificial
                     offerings pointing forward to the death of Christ as the great sin
                     offering were established. But had the law of God never been
                     transgressed, there would have been no death, and no need of a
                     Saviour."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 363.

King of Kings      LESSON 13                                        ❑ Monday
                                                                   December 24
          Part 2   "Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only
    KING ETERNAL wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen"
                 (1 Tim. 1:17).

                      In this doxology Paul mentions some important characteris-
                   tics of God—He is forever sovereign, untouched by change or
                   decay, beyond the reach of human eyes, and the only one whose
                   wisdom is impeccable.

                    Contrasted with the wages of death, what is the gift of God?
                   Rom. 6:23.
                      Life is a very precious commodity, and God desires that we
                   shall have it abundantly (John 10:10). He is the only source of
                   life (John 11:25). The knowledge of God leads to life eternal
                   (John 17:3). It is very fitting, therefore, that our God should be
                   represented as an eternal King.
                      The concept of eternal kingship rules out the possibility of
                   unwelcome change or an order passing away. It speaks of
                   stability and continuity, that which creates trust.

                     What does the psalmist say about God's kingdom in Psalm
                   145:13?
                     God's kingly authority governs all time and space. In other
                   words He is the sole ruler of the universe, and as such demands
                   our compliance and worship.

                     What does God say about Himself in Malachi 3:6?

                     "Change and decay in all around I see; 0 Thou, who changest
                   not, abide with me!"—Henry F. Lyte, Church Hymnal, no. 50.
                   (See James 1:17.) Because God remains eternally the same, we
                   have the assured hope that He will fulfill His promises.
                     By contrast we can see how fickle man has been. Laban
                   deceived Jacob and changed his wages ten times (Gen. 31:7).
                   We cannot put our trust even in princes. We can never be certain
                   of anything in this life, particularly riches (1 Tim. 6:17)! We can
                   only be certain that God is ruling heaven, that all things are in
                   His control, and that we are under His care if we put our trust in
                   Him.

THINK IT THROUGH     How can we express our loyalty to our Eternal King?

                     "Lead on, 0 King Eternal, we follow, not with fears,
                     For gladness breaks like morning where'er Thy face appears;
                     Thy cross is lifted o'er us; we journey in its light;
                     The crown awaits the conquest; lead on, 0 God of might.

                        battle" (Ps. 24:7, 8).

                         "King of glory" and "glorious King" are one and the same in
                        meaning. Our wonderful God is a King all glorious.

                          What request did Moses make regarding God's glory? Ex.
                        33:18.

                           God's glory is seen in His gracious character. Some people
                        think that glory is an outward manifestation of light, a display of
                        riches and power. But God's glory has to do with His inner
                        being. What He is makes Him glorious. God made all His good-
                        ness to pass before Moses.
                           Jesus pointed out the difference between an inherent glory
                        and one that is "put on" when He contrasted the lily of the field
                        with Solomon and all his finery. If we want to reflect the glory of
                        God, we need to allow God to remake us, and then we can
                        radiate the glory of God in our lives.

                          What does Jeremiah warn against in Jeremiah 9:23, 24?

                          A true knowledge of God will show that man cannot boast of
                        anything. All that he has comes from God. Many do not under-
                        stand this, and they take pride in their accomplishments. But
                        what a man can do in his own strength is as nothing compared
                        with what he can do in the strength of the Lord.
                          God's glory is seen not only in His goodness and mercy. It is
                        seen also in the conflict with evil. When sin first entered heaven,
                        God was all good in pleading with Lucifer and his angels. But
                        the time came when there could be no room for rebellion in
                        heaven. A war broke out in which Michael and His angels fought
                        against the dragon and his angels. (See Rev. 12:7-9.) Then there
                        was the struggle on the cross, when it seemed as though Satan
                        had gained the victory. But with the resurrection God was vindi-
                        cated. Truth will always triumph over evil. The King of glory is
                        "mighty in battle." Because He is strong, we may be strong too.

THINK IT THROUGH          What does Paul mean when he admonishes, "Do all to the
                        glory of God"? (1 Cor. 10:31).

                          "A mere profession of faith in Christ, a boastful knowledge of
                        the truth, does not make a man a Christian. A religion that seeks
                        only to gratify the eye, the ear, and the taste, or that sanctions
                        self-indulgence, is not the religion of Christ."—The Acts of the
                        Apostles, p. 317.

King of Kings      LESSON 13                                     ❑ Wednesday
                                                                  December 26
          Part 4   "In the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a
   FINAL VICTORY kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom
                 shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and
                 consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever" (Dan.
                 2:44).

                     In this world kingdoms have risen and fallen. Shall this go on
                   forever and ever? God's answer is No. The time is coming when
                   God can brook no more delay. Everyone will have decided
                   which side of the conflict he is taking, and God will destroy the
                   wicked and vindicate the righteous.

                     Who does Daniel, in another vision, state are the final vic-
                   tors? Dan. 7:27.

                     "Here is a reassuring glimpse of the final outcome of all the
                   turmoil and persecution through which the saints have passed.
                   Blessed thought! Christ is soon to return for His saints and
                   usher them into their everlasting kingdom and reward."—
                   S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 4, p. 834.

                      According to Peter, how will God finally act? 2 Peter 2:4-9.

                       Lot, with all his faults, was vexed with what he saw around
                    him. But the solution to the problem was not in his power.
                    Sometimes we get jealous for reform, and want to turn the world
                    upside down. But we are not always wise enough to understand
                    what the problem really is. In our relations with other people we
                    are not in a position to judge or execute judgment. "Vengeance
                    is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord" (Rom. 12:19).

                      How soon will God set up His kingdom? Rev. 22:20.

                      Jesus told His disciples to watch for the signs of His coming
                   (Matt. 24:42). We know we are living in the last days because the
                   prophecies have almost all been fulfilled. It is not for us to know
                   the time of His coming (Acts 1:7), but we are to be ready since
                   His coming will be unexpected (Matt. 24:44).
                      "More than eighteen centuries have passed since the apos-
                   tles rested from their labors, but the history of their toils and
                   sacrifices for Christ's sake is still among the most precious
                   treasures of the church. This history, written under the direction
                   of the Holy Spirit, was recorded in order that by it the followers
                   of Christ in every age might be impelled to a greater zeal and
                   earnestness in the cause of the Saviour."—The Acts of the
                   Apostles, p. 593.

THINK IT THROUGH      How do we know that Christ's coming is certain? Why do you
                    think there has been a delay?

King of Kings        LESSON 13                                       ❑ Thursday
                                                                    December 27

            Part 5     "Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes
       A REIGN IN    shall rule in judgment" (Isa. 32:1).
  RIGHTEOUSNESS
                       Man has always looked forward to a reign in which righteous-
                     ness prevails. Rulers have made broad promises. Citizens have
                     overthrown kingdoms in which injustice has been rampant. But
                     the ideal has never been reached.

                       How are the people to react when the Lord reigns? Ps. 97:1;
                     Ps. 99:1.
                       Rejoicing and trembling are apparently conflicting emotions.
                     But trembling suggests a spirit of reverence rather than of fear.
                     Recognition of a holy God, a God as great as our wonderful
                     God, demands a posture of humility and waiting. No one wants
                     to move except to do what is right. At the same time the heart is
                     bubbling up with joy because the great day has come, the day of
                     seeing right prevail, of mutual love and caring. This is a day we
                     have anticipated, and now it is here. .

                       What is one element that will cause rejoicing? Ps. 9:14.

                       Being saved is a goal that some of us hardly feel possible for
                     us. Paul felt that he was the chief of sinners (1 Tim. 1:15). But
                     God's grace is abundant (verse 14). Joshua the high priest was a
                     "brand plucked out of the fire" (Zech. 3:2). But God had made
                     every provision for him. Thus it will be with us, and we shall
                     rejoice that God has saved us in spite of ourselves.

                       What was God's promise to Israel regarding iniquity at the
                     time of the Lord's reign? Isa. 33:22, 24.

                       It can be our privilege to live during the Lord's eternal reign
                     only because of God's forgiveness. God is eager for us to live in
                     His kingdom. Jesus has extended a gracious invitation (John
                     14:1-3). John the revelator had a glimpse of the earth made new
                     and recorded the invitation of the Spirit (Rev. 22:17). Paul says
                     that the suffering we may have in this world is no hindrance to
                     us when we consider future glory (Rom. 8:18, 19). Our minds
                     must be set not on the things around us but on the things above.

THINK IT THROUGH       What are some of the things that I look forward to when God
                     sets up His kingdom?

                        "With unutterable delight the children of earth enter into the
                     joy and the wisdom of unfallen beings. They share the treasures
                     of knowledge and understanding gained through ages upon
                     ages in contemplation of God's handiwork."—The Great Con-

King of Kings      LESSON 13                                             ❑ Friday
                                                                    December 28
         Part 6      Who did John the revelator see honoring Christ?
    JESUS, OUR
   WORTHY KING        "Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and
                   riches; and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and
                   blessing. And every creature which is in heaven, and on the
                   earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all
                   that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and
                   glory, and power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and
                   unto the Lamb for ever and ever" (Rev. 5:12, 13).

                     The scene is the final coronation of Christ after the thousand
                   years. He had occupied the throne with God before the fall of
                   man, but He had given it up when He came to earth as man to
                   give up His life for man's salvation.
                      Now Jesus is to reign again as Lord over all the universe. And
                   all the universe is there to witness His coronation. All the un-
                   fallen beings are there from other worlds and all the angels of
                   heaven. The fallen angels are also there, outside the walls of the
                   New Jerusalem, with Satan their leader. All mankind is likewise
                   there, the righteous within, the wicked without the city.
                      As Christ is crowned King of kings and Lord of lords—as He is
                   given a name "above every name"—all, both good and evil, bow
                   in homage before Him.

                     Why is Christ worthy of the highest honors that can be
                   bestowed upon Him? Rev. 5:9, 10.

                      "As Christ in His expiring agony upon the cross cried out, 'It is
                   finished' (John 19:30), a shout of triumph rang through every
                   world and through heaven itself. The great contest that had
                   been so long in progress in this world was now decided, and
                   Christ was conqueror. His death had answered the question
                   whether the Father and the Son had sufficient love for man to
                   exercise self-denial and a spirit of sacrifice.... With one voice
                   the loyal universe united in extolling the divine administration."
                   —Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 69, 70.

THINK IT THROUGH     Seeing we are to be kings and reign on earth (See Rev. 5:10),
                   how should we behave now when we are given authority over
                   other men?

What is your concept of God? Do you view Him as a Rev. Jimmy
Jones—professing concern for your welfare but all the while
demanding unfailing conformity to His rigid rules? Or do you view
Him as a product of good public relations—promoting Himself as
your example of what you could become, knowing all the while that
He wasn't really like you at all?
Whether you subscribe at all to either of the above opinions, you
owe it to God and to yourself to read two revealing new books from
the Review and Herald about God, His law, and His expectations for
you.
