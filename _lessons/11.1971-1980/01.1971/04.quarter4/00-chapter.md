      The Blessing of Daily Study
    "Every day some portion of time should be appropriated
to the study of the lessons, not merely in learning to me-
chanically repeat the words, while the mind does not com-
prehend the meaning; but to go to the very foundation, and
become familiar with what is brought out in the lesson."
—Counsels on Sabbath School Work, page 53.




                     My Pledge
    As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge of
the Scriptures, I pledge myself to the careful and prayerful
study of some portion of my Sabbath School lesson each
day of the week.

                  Home ReDation
                 FOURTH QUARTER, 1971

    The common practice of relegating the discipline and training of children
and young people to agencies outside the home is altogether devastating in
its results. Contrary to what is sometimes supposed, the youth crave from
their parents the leadership and guidance without which they feel unsure
of themselves.
   Reasonably, there comes the question: What are parents for? Not simply
to supply food and shelter and physical necessities, although this is a great
and wonderful service in itself. Parents are also counselors, builders of char-
acter, teachers of truth. They must not abdicate their position as parents.
They are those to whom God has given children, with the prime respon-
sibility as molders and shapers of manners and morals and faith. It is the
purpose of the lessons for this quarter to review the duties of parents and
to determine how they may best accomplish their task.
   In the great revival and reformation that is to take place in the church,
there is no better place to begin than in the home. And for the great thrust
of worldwide evangelism, no finer preparation can be made than that which
takes place at the family altar and in the hearts of each member of God's
great household of faith.
   Of a preparation for camp meeting years ago Ellen G. White made this
statement: "At home is the place to find Jesus; then take Him with you to
the meeting, and how precious will be the hours you spend there. . . . Pre-
pare your children for the occasion. Teach them that it is not of so much
consequence that they appear with fine clothes as that they appear before
God with clean hands and pure hearts. . . . Even unbelievers will feel the
holy atmosphere as they enter the encampment. . . . It will be to your soul
even as the gate of heaven."—Testimonies, Vol. 5, pages 164, 165.
   The duty upon parents is much more than merely to provide. It is also
to teach and train, to counsel, and, as necessary, to correct—to live the part
of parents, with gentleness and firmness so intermixed as never to avoid wise
discipline or the doing of duty; to show forth leadership, and remember
never to leave out love.
   Let us pray for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on our homes as we
study the lessons for this quarter.

                                                                        September 26

          GOD, THE of God created He him; male and female created He them.
         ARCHITECT And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruit-
                       ful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue
                       it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over
                       the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that
        Gen. 1:27, 28 moveth upon the earth."

                            Does the Bible give us an indication of how God
                         began the first home? Gen. 2:18-24.


                            In the creation of the home God designed that the mother
                         and father should form the basis of the family. Society was
                         not to arrange its existence on any kind of communal group-
                         ing. What was to give the human family its distinctive char-
                         acter was the permanent relationship which was to exist be-
                         tween mother and father. The family was to depend upon
                         these two for its mental, spiritual, and physical resources.

                           How long was this relationship to exist between the
                         man and the woman? Matt. 19:3-9.



                           When, in God's plan, did the first family become
                         complete? Gen. 4:1, 2.


                            The command to "replenish the earth" is as important to
                         the plan of God in the creation of the home as the declaration,
                         "And they shall be one flesh."
                            "A childless house is a desolate place. The hearts of the in-
                         mates are in danger of becoming selfish, of cherishing a love
                         for their own ease, and consulting their own desires and con-
                         veniences. They gather sympathy to themselves, but have little
                         to bestow upon others."—The Adventist Home, page 159.
    THINK IT THROUGH        If the mother and father form the basis of the family,
                         are the parents totally responsible for the strength or
                         weakness of that home? Is conceiving children within the
                         family situation the only way completely to fulfill God's
                         plan for the home?


    "Society is composed of families, and    nation is the household. The well-being
is what the heads of families make           of society, the success of the church, the
it. Out of the heart are 'the issues of      prosperity of the nation, depend upon
life' (Prov. 4:23); and the heart of the     home influences."—"The Ministry of
community, of the church, and of the         Healing," page 349.

The Home Is Built        LESSON 1                                         ❑ Monday
                                                                       September 27
             Part 2         "Through wisdom is an house builded; and by under-
 MAN, THE BUILDER        standing it is established: and by knowledge shall the
       Prov. 24:3, 4     chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches."

                            What must be the first consideration in the building
                   14,
                         of a home?


                           "The first work to be done in a Christian home is to see
                         that the Spirit of Christ abides there, that every member of
                         the household may be able to take his cross and follow where
                         Jesus leads the way."—The Adventist Home, page 20. As with
                         the church, so with the home, Jesus Christ must be "the Chief
                         Cornerstone, in whom all the building fitly framed together
                         groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord." Eph. 2:20, 21. "It
                         is only in Christ that a marriage alliance can be safely formed.
                         Human love should draw its closest bonds from divine love.
                         Only where Christ reigns can there be deep, true, unselfish
                         affection."—The Ministry of Healing, page 358.

                           If we wish Christ to occupy the central place in our
                         home, what must we do? Rev. 3:20.



                           What is the next consideration in making the home
                         what God intended for it to be? Rom. 12:10.


                            "Tender affection should ever be cherished between husband
                         and wife, parents and children, brothers and sisters. Every
                         hasty word should be checked, and there should not be even
                         the appearance of lack of love for one another."—The Advent-
                         ist Home, page 198.

 THINK IT THROUGH           What does it mean to make Christ the center of the
                         home? What are some of the ways parents and children
                         can manifest their love toward each other?


   "God desires that heaven's plan           be seen in all our families, in our in-

              Part 3   "For the husband is the head of the wife, even as
         THE ROLE OF Christ is the head of the church: and He is the Saviour of
        THE HUSBAND the body."
           Eph. 5:23
                           That the father is the head of the home is a principle estab-
                        lished within the plan of the home which God created. How-
                        ever, this idea has been grossly misunderstood by some. To
                        be head of the home means that the father should be director
                        of the home, not the dictator. He is not a lord but a leader.
                        He stands at the head of the family not as sovereign but as
                        a source of physical and spiritual strength. He is as willing to
                        listen as he is to speak, as willing to follow counsel as he is
                        to give it. What makes him the head of the home is that he
                        can be trusted to seek for that which is the very best for his
                        family. It must be remembered that he is the head of the home
                        as Christ is the head of the church.

                           What should the husband's attitude be toward his
                        wife? Eph. 5:28.


                           "He should cultivate refinement and courtesy. He should
                        be very tender and gentle toward his wife, who is his equal in
                        every respect; he should not utter a word that would cast a
                        shadow upon her heart."—Testimonies, Vol. 4, pp. 36, 37.
                           The husband must make sure that in all his relationships
                        with his wife he maintains that dignity which has been be-
                        stowed by God on all His human creatures. He should always
                        hold her in honor and respect. 1 Peter 3:7.

                           What should be the husband's attitude toward his
                        children? Eph. 6:4; Col. 3:21; Ps. 103:13.


                           "Give some of your leisure hours to your children; become
                        acquainted with them; associate with them in their work and
                        in their sports, and win their confidence. Cultivate friendship
                        with them, especially with your sons. In this way you will be

         THE WIFE
       Prey. 18:22

                         What is the wife's place in the home? Gen. 2:21-22.



                         If the husband is the head, the wife could be said to be
                      the heart of the home. As the physical body needs both head
                      and heart, so the family is dependent on both mother and
                      father. Equal in importance, they each play a different role.
                      They complement each other but do not compete. She partici-
                      pates with the father in the direction of the family. Prov. 31:26.
                      She helps her husband and children toward the goal that God
                      holds before them. She brings the refinement and strength of
                      her femininity and makes it an influence in the home.

                        What should the wife's attitude be toward her hus-
                      band?



                         "The wife is to respect her husband. The husband is to love
                      and cherish his wife; and as their marriage vow unites them
                      as one, so their belief in Christ should make them one in Him."

                             "This is the first commandment with promise. It is binding
                         upon childhood and youth, upon the middle-aged and the

                         from honoring their parents. This solemn obligation is binding
                         upon every son and daughter and is one of the conditions to

                         children? Eph. 6:4.

                         rules that are too rigid, lead to the disregard of all regulations;

         Ps. 144:12
                            The home is not to be a self-contained, uninvolved entity.
                        It is not merely a place for humans to live and breed and die.
                        It is not merely for the propagation of the human race. It has
                        a higher destiny and purpose. The mission of the home ex-
                        tends beyond its own members. "The Christian home is to be
                        an object lesson, illustrating the excellence of the true principles
                        of life."—The Ministry of Healing, page 352.
                            "The Christian home is God's insurance of righteousness in
                        the earth. The home can never be completely abolished without
                        the race's slipping into promiscuity of sex relations, disintegra-

                        the more the home is built up to its original plan and purpose,
                        and the better parents and prospective parents are fitted for
                        their duties, the more virtuous, competent, and stable will be

                        page 29.
                            "A well-ordered Christian household is a powerful argu-
                        ment in favor of the reality of the Christian religion—an argu-
                        ment that the infidel cannot gainsay. All can see that there is
                        an influence at work in the family that affects the children,
                        and that the God of Abraham is with them. If the homes of
                        professed Christians had a right religious mold, they would
                        exert a mighty influence for good. They would indeed be
                         the 'light of the world.'"—The Adventist Home, page 36.

          REQUISITE
        1 Cor. 13:13   The foundation of the home must be love—the love which
                          is not primarily an emotion, but a principle. Love can only
                          be understood in the light of the cross. At the cross the be-
                          liever in Christ sees the fullest expression of that love. There
                          Christ showed His ultimate concern; there He demonstrated
                          love which would go to any length to provide the best for His
                          own. If parents in a home are motivated in their thoughts and
                          actions by such a principle, they can form a partnership that
                          will bear the irritations of life and leave for their children
                          a legacy that will prepare them for a future with God.
                             "Love is a precious gift, which we receive from Jesus. Pure
                          and holy affection is not a feeling, but a principle. Those who
                          are actuated by true love are neither unreasonable nor blind.
                          Taught by the Holy Spirit, they love God supremely, and
                          their neighbor as themselves."—The Ministry of Healing,
                          pages 358, 359. Love "doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh
                          not her own, is not easily provoked." 1 Cor. 13:5.

                             Why would the apostle encourage all parents to "put
                          on love"? Col. 3:14.




 THINK IT THROUGH            What is there about love that makes for a binding
                          partnership? What is the difference between love as a
                          principle and love as an emotion? Can there be true
                          love in a home when one partner imposes his will upon
                          the other?

                        and likewise also the husband hath not power of his
        1 Cor. 7:3, 4   own body, but the wife."

                            If there is one thing above another which will create a
                        rift in any marriage partnership, it is the desire of one partner
                        to be above the other. Supremacy in marriage is not a worth-
                        while object to strive for. A true partnership in marriage can
                        be achieved only when each shows respect to the other and
                        treats him as an equal. In the Christian home the husband
                        is to treat the wife with goodwill, honoring and cherishing her,
                        learning to understand her needs and desires as she will learn
                        to respect his.
                            "Neither the husband nor the wife should attempt to exer-
                        cise over the other an arbitrary control. Do not try to compel
                        each other to yield to your wishes. You cannot do this and
                        retain each other's love. Be kind, patient, and forbearing, con-
                        siderate, and courteous. By the grace of God you can succeed
                        in making each other happy, as in your marriage vow you
                        promised to do."--The Ministry of Healing, page 361.

                           What does Peter say should be the relationship exist-
                        ing between husbands and wives? 1 Peter 3:7.




                           The very warmth of the love that binds two hearts to-
                        gether, the closeness of contact of two lives joined as one, are
                        to be guarded with devout prayer and watchful care.

 THINK IT THROUGH          What do we mean by the equality of husband and
                        wife? In what way could husbands and wives best show
                        their respect for each other?

        1 Cor. 13:4-7
                           In marriage two individuals come closer and discover more
                        about each other than in any other association in life. This is
                        why the early period of marriage is a critical time. The care
                        with which each has gone through the courtship tends to slip
                        as the trials of living become very real. The weaknesses that
                        had been zealously controlled begin to show through. It is
                        very easy to see defects. If each learns the lessons of patience
                        and forbearance, the partnership will grow strong and that
                        strength will help each partner to overcome the defects that
                        may be part of his character. The assurance of success in the
                        building of a home lies in mutual love and forbearance.
                           "Though difficulties, perplexities, and discouragements may
                        arise, let neither husband nor wife harbor the thought that
                        their union is a mistake or a disappointment. Determine to be
                        all that it is possible to be to each other. Continue the early
                        attentions. In every way encourage each other in fighting the
                        battles of life. Study to advance the happiness of each other.
                        Let there be mutual love, mutual forbearance. Then marriage,
                        instead of being the end of love, will be as it were the very
                        beginning of love."—The Ministry of Healing, page 360.


                           What admonition to all Christians applies especially
                        to husbands and wives? Rom. 12:10.




                           "We cannot cherish home affection with too much care; for
                        the home, if the Spirit of the Lord dwells there, is a type of
                        heaven. . . . If one errs, the other will exercise Christlike for-

 THINK IT THROUGH          Is there ever a time when a husband or wife can come
                        to the limit in forbearance? What is the relationship
                        between forbearance and infidelity?

                                                                        October 6
           Part 4         "Can two walk together, except they be agreed?"
      A SHARE IN
  HOME PLANNING           Our text provides a very important thought which will
                       make a home either a partnership or a chaotic situation. In
        Amos 3:3
                       too many cases husbands and wives find themselves at variance
                       as to how to govern the home. There are those who think that
                       because they are the head of the home all decisions are to be
                       made by them irrespective of how the wife feels. This was
                       never the plan of God in the forming of the home. A home
                       which is run on this basis may soon disintegrate, and the hus-
                       band and wife often go their separate ways before many
                       summers come and go. When the prophet says that it is diffi-
                       cult for two to walk together unless they are agreed, he is
                       suggesting an essential principle of a happy home. Both hus-
                       band and wife hold the responsibility for the home. They are
                       both to come together and share in the destiny of their chil-
                       dren. Counseling together, they are to plan a course of action
                       which will help the whole family toward God and heaven. It
                       is good for any husband and wife to remember the words of
                       Eccl. 4:9-12.

                          In giving man a companion, how did God emphasize
                       this principle of corporate planning and action by hus-
                       band and wife? Gen. 2:18.




                          "The happiness and prosperity of the marriage relation
                       depends upon the unity of the parties."—Patriarchs and
                       Prophets, page 174. As a "helpmeet" the wife is to be a coun-
                       selor and help in the building of the home.

 THINK IT THROUGH         What can a wife do when she finds herself not being
                       included in any of the decisions having to do with her
                       home? What are the ways in which a wife can truly be
                       a fellow planner of the home? What part should a wife
                       play in the devotional aspect of the home?

           A LOVING      they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof."
           DIALOGUE
          Prov. 18:21      More unhappiness can result from a communications failure
                        than from any other one cause. When problems and disagree-
                        ments arise, many couples aggravate the trouble by a failure
                        to discuss their problems. But it is only by a free and open
                        exchange between husband and wife that many a disagreement
                        can be avoided. Two people who are truly in love desire to
                        know each other more and more as the years go by. In this
                        knowledge they will find a closeness which will bind them
                        together and will be a source of strength for each as they face
                        the problems of life together. In no better way can this be
                        accomplished than by an exchange of thoughts and ideas, of
                        goals and ambitions. There is no place in the Christian home
                        for a wife to live in loneliness because of a lack of communi-
                        cation. There is no place in the Christian home for a man or
                        wife to speak only in grunts or well-aimed stinging words.
                        The marriage will grow ever sweeter and stronger in the ex-
                        change of words that represent a living and loving dialogue.

  THINK IT THROUGH         How much should a wife say to her husband about
                        herself? And he about himself? What are the important
                        things that husband and wife should talk about? What
                        conversations should they avoid when the children are
                        present?

The Home Is a Partnership       LESSON 2                                 ❑ Friday
                                                                         October 8

 A COMMON FAITH       lievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with un-
       2 Cor. 6:14    righteousness? and what communion hath light with
                      darkness?"

                          Unless husband and wife see eye to eye in the basic ele-
                       ments of religious faith, they cannot be one in purpose. So
                       far as possible, then, provision for this unity should be made
                       at the very beginning, by selecting a mate from the same
                       church fellowship. It is granted that being members of the
                       same church does not in itself ensure spiritual unity. And
                       sometimes the faith of either husband or wife may grow cold
                       or their experience may undergo a change. Still it is no ad-
                       vantage, indeed it is folly, to accept consciously such a divi-
                       sion at the beginning.

                         Why did Moses admonish the Israelites not to inter-
                       marry with the Canaanites? Deut. 7:3, 4.



                          "There is in the Christian world an astonishing, alarming
                       indifference to the teaching of God's Word in regard to the
                       marriage of Christians with unbelievers. Many who profess
                       to love and fear God choose to follow the bent of their own
                       minds rather than take counsel of Infinite Wisdom. In a
                       matter which vitally concerns the happiness and well-being
                       of both parties for this world and the next, reason, judgment,
                       and the fear of God are set aside, and blind impulse, stubborn
                       determination, is allowed to control. . . . All this is as Satan
                       would have it. . . . It is no easy thing to decide what advice
                       can be given to these unfortunate ones, or how their hard lot
                        can be lightened; but their sad experience should be a warn-

          Prov. 15:4
                           Spirit and atmosphere of the home is primarily a responsi-
                        bility of the parents. The cheerfulness of the home will depend
                        on how parents relate to life with its hardships or its joys. The
                        parents can promote a spirit of tranquillity and peace or a
                        spirit of contention. This is determined by the parents' atti-
                        tudes and words. It will be determined also in their disposi-
                        tion. Theirs will be either a spirit of optimism, faith, and
                        love, or one of pessimism, unbelief, and hostility. The children's
                        attitude toward religion and toward the church will be deter-
                        mined to a great degree by the attitudes of their parents to
                        these things. And this attitude and outlook on every part of
                        life will be carried from the home into the world.
                           "Parents, be cheerful, not common and cheap, but be
                        thankful and obedient and submissive to your heavenly
                        Father. You are not at liberty to act out your feelings if things
                        should arise that irritate. Winning love is to be like deep
                        waters, ever flowing forth in the management of your chil-

                        ones to Christ. If parents would educate their children to be
                        pleasant, they should never speak in a scolding manner to
                        them. Educate yourself to carry a pleasant countenance, and
                        bring all the sweetness and melody possible into your voice.
                        The angels of God are ever near your little ones, and your

Parents in the Home     LESSON 3                                     ❑     Monday
                                                                       October 11
            Part 2      "And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy chil-
         TEACHING dren, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine
                      house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when
          Deut. 6:7 thou liest down, and when thou risest up."

                          It was always the plan of God that parents should be the
                       teachers for their children. When Israel was brought out of
                       Egypt, He again emphasized the work of the parents as teach-
                       ers. Unfortunately in many instances this has been overlooked
                       by modern parents. They have relinquished their responsibil-
                       ity and left it all for the teacher in the school. However, the
                       school is to be a supplement for the work which is done in
                       the home by mothers and fathers. In the final analysis, it is
                       in the home where children are prepared for school and for
                       life. See The Adventist Home, page 185. The responsibility of
                       being teachers to their children is most important, and to
                       neglect it is to rob the children of that which will prepare
                       them for life.
                           "Parents should not lightly regard the work of training
                       their children, nor neglect it upon any account. They should
                       employ much time in careful study of the laws which regu-

                       in sound bodies."—Child Guidance, pages 21, 22.

                           According to the wise man, why is parental teaching
                        so important? Prov. 22:6.

             Part 3       "Hear, 0 Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord: and
          RELIGIOUS thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and
         EDUCATION with all thy soul, and with all thy might. And these
                       words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine
                       heart: and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy
          Deut. 6:4-7 children."

                             A child first learns about God from his parents. He should
                         also learn from his parents the place that God should hold in
                         his life. He catches the sincerity and reality of God from the
                         relationship of his parents with God. The foundation, then,
                         for the religious life of the child is laid by the parents, and
                         on this foundation is built their future spiritual faith. The
                         meaning of God is learned at home. If God is not taken se-
                         riously, this attitude will be passed along to the children. If
                         the children never see their parents pray, they will consider
                         that God does not matter much. This makes the practice of
                         family worship important. For when it is entered into with
                        iiriTifityFrdeirotionrwhen the children see their parents in
                         this act of commitment and worship, the children will come
                         to believe in the importance of God for life. The worship
                         time will then become a symbol to the whole family that God
                         stands at the center of all family activity. It will be seen by
                         the children that the Bible is more than a book for display;
                         it is truly a book for life. And in this religious education of
                         the family both father and mother should share.

 THINK IT THROUGH            How can we make the relationship with God a reality
                         to our children? What are some of 'the reasons for the
                         neglect of worship in the home? Who should take the

             Part 4       "Children, the right thing for you to do is to obey your
         DISCIPLINE parents as those whom God has set over you. The first
                       commandment to contain a promise was: Honor thy father
                       and thy mother that it may be well with thee, and that
                       thou mayest live long on the earth. Fathers, don't over-

         Eph. 6:1-4, the commandment. Bring them up with Christian teaching
            Phillips   in Christian discipline."

                          What is the duty of children to parents and the duty
                       of parents to children? Col. 3:20, 21.



                          Of all the responsibilities that fall to parents, discipline is
                       perhaps the most delicate. It is here that the relationship be-
                       tween parent and child will be made or broken. It is in the
                       realm of discipline that the parent must look seriously and
                       earnestly into his own heart. For discipline may flow either
                       from emotional troubles or out of a heart that loves enough
                       that it may have to hurt in order to help. In many cases dis-
                       cipline is a form of retaliation on the child for his "affront"
                       to parental authority.

                           What are the results of correct home discipline?



                           "One of the first lessons a child needs to learn is the lesson
                        of obedience. Before he is old enough to reason, he may be
                        taught to obey. By gentle, persistent effort, the habit should be
                        established. Thus, to a great degree, may be prevented those
                        later conflicts between will and authority that do so much
                        to create alienation and bitterness toward parents and teach-
                        ers, and too often resistance of all authority, human and
                        divine ."—Education , page 287.

                            Training in courtesy and etiquette in many homes is over-
                         looked as something that belongs only to the rich and the elite
                         in society. This attitude is the result of a misunderstanding of
                         courtesy and etiquette. There is much more to etiquette and
                         courtesy than simply doing the right thing at the right time.
                         These are social disciplines which express thoughtfulness and
                         respect to others. To be courteous is to be thoughtful. Eti-

                         considerate of others. A Christian should be naturally the

                           What should parents teach their children regarding

                           Of all the responsibilities which have been overlooked by
                        parents most frequently is one which pertains to healthful
                        living. Yet the present and future happiness of their children
                        depends on their understanding and obeying the rules of health.
                        Much of the illness which plagues thousands could be avoided
                        if only, as children, they had been given the right instruction
                        in health. "The first study of the young should be to know

                           "In the early education of children, many parents and
                        teachers fail to understand that the greatest attention needs

                           "The future happiness of your families and the welfare

                       seems to be the basic reason for joyfulness? Ps. 95:7.



                          From the very beginning man has worshiped. Worship and
                       love welled up in the hearts of Adam and Eve even after they
                       were driven from their Eden home.
                          "The fallen race were long permitted to gaze upon the
                       home of innocence, their entrance barred only by the watch-
                       ing angels. At the cherubim-guarded gate of Paradise the
                       divine glory was revealed. Hither came Adam and his sons to
                       worship God."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 62.
                          Jacob's experience when he was fleeing from his brother's
                       wrath illustrates man's normal desire to call upon God.
                          "And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely
                       the Lord is in this place; and I knew it not. And he was
                       afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other
                       but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven. And Jacob
                       rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had
                       put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil
                       upon the top of it. And he called the name of that place
                       Bethel. . . . This stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall
                       be God's house." Gen. 28:16-22.

                         How does the psalmist symbolize our need for com-
                       munion with God? Ps. 42:1.



 THINK IT THROUGH          What does it mean to worship? Why does man need
                       to worship? Is going to church the only way to worship?

     IN THE HOME
                          The experience of Job reveals to all the need and place of
           Job 1:5     worship in the home. Man is a dependent creature in need of -
                       assistance in living. We are not only dependent on God for
                       the air we breathe but also for His protection from danger and
                       from the forces of evil. Worship is the acknowledgment of this
                       dependence on God and thanksgiving for God's care over us.
                       For a Christian home, worship is as essential as the meals and
                       the shelter that it provides. These provisions are essential for
                       the physical well-being of the family. Worship is essential for
                       the spiritual as well as the physical safety of the family.
                          "Before leaving the house for labor, all the family should
                       be called together; and the father, or the mother in the fath-
                       er's absence, should plead fervently with God to keep them
                       through the day. Come in humility, with a heart full of ten-
                       derness, and with a sense of the temptations and dangers
                       before yourselves and your children; by faith bind them upon
                       the altar, entreating for them the care of the Lord. Ministering
                       angels will guard children who are thus dedicated to God."
                        —Child Guidance, page 519.

                           What is the Biblical assurance that God will hear and
                        answer the prayers of parents and children at such ses-
                        sions of worship? James 5:16?



 THINK IT THROUGH          What are some of the ways by which worship can be

      AND WORSHIP
         Ps. 119:105       The Scriptures are a revelation of God and His purpose for
                        man. In order for a person to know what his life on earth is
                        to mean he must become acquainted with what God has re-
                        vealed in the Scriptures. There He has had written for our
                        good the origins of the human race, the reasons for the crea-
                        tion of man, and the purpose for life. The reason man has
                        gone so far astray is that he has thwarted the plan and pur-
                        pose of God for himself. Man realizes that something is wrong
                        and is endeavoring in every imaginable way to solve his di-
                        lemma, in many cases without God. For man to regain his lost
                        estate he must discover the perfect plan of God for His creation
                        and accept that plan as the guide to abundant living. The Bible
                        reveals not only the plan but also man's problem and the
                        solution to his problem. The act of worship, whether family
                        or public, is the way by which man comes face to face with
                        the will and love of God as revealed in the Scriptures.
                           "We all need a guide through the many strait places in life
                        as much as the sailor needs a pilot over the sandy bar or up
                        the rocky river, and where is this guide to be found? We point
                        you, dear brethren, to the Bible. Inspired of God, written by
                        holy men, it points out with great clearness and precision the
                        duties of both old and young. . . . Take it as the man of your
                        counsel, the rule of your daily life."---Testimonies, Vol. 5, p.
                        264.

                           What does the apostle say the Scriptures are good
                        for? And to what point will they lead in the fulfillment
                        of God's plan for man? 2 Tim. 3:16, 17.


 THINK IT THROUGH          Should the Scriptures be considered as a book of in-
                        structions to be followed like a rule book? In what way
                        will the Bible help me to find the purpose for my life?

            Part 4    "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days

       Ex. 20:8-11 blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it."

                          Thus far we have been discussing the place of worship in the
                      home. However, family worship is not an end in itself but
                      moves on to a wider form of worship. Worship in the home
                      may very easily be seen as a preparation for that expanded
                      worship we experience in the weekly church services. Much of
                      the spiritual awareness which may be received in Sabbath wor-
                      ship can be lost through the week as one pursues his livelihood.
                      The daily worship at home helps to maintain the spiritual
                      sensitivity which has been gained at such convocations. It
                      prepares for the coming Sabbath. Too many wait for the last
                      fleeting moments of the working .part of the week to prepare
                      physically and spiritually for the Sabbath. It is no wonder that
                      little is received by some at worship services. When six days
                      have been filled only with bargaining, work, and television, the
                      mind cannot shift so quickly to the spiritual.

                          For what higher worship does the Sabbath worship
                       in turn prepare us? Isa. 66:22, 23.


                          "To the humble, believing soul, the house of God on earth
                       is the gate of heaven. The song of praise, the prayer, the words
                       spoken by Christ's representatives, are God's appointed agen-

 THINK IT THROUGH          In what ways does the family worship prepare me
                       for Sabbath worship? Why does the Bible speak so much

  SABBATH WORSHIP       silence before Him."
         Hab. 2:20
                           Prepared by our daily worship and private devotions we
                        now carry that personal relationship with God with us into
                        the higher worship on the Sabbath. It is a divine appointment
                        which should be taken seriously. For we as creatures are to
                        come before the great God who is our loving Father.

                           In view of this fact, what attitude should characterize
                        our conduct in the house of God? Eccl. 5:1.



                           "If some have to wait a few minutes before the meeting
                        begins, let them maintain a true spirit of devotion by silent
                        meditation, keeping the heart uplifted to God in prayer that

                           "Too often children are allowed to grow up without religion

      AND SERVICE
                   A study of the experience of Christ and His disciples in a
                       grainfield on the Sabbath brings to mind the greatest lesson
                       we can learn about the Sabbath.
                          If the Sabbath was truly made for man, what guidance can
                       this give us for Sabbath activity? Why was man given a Sab-
                       bath?

                          Is there ever an occasion when one may transgress
                       the Sabbath commandment and not sin? Matt. 12:11, 12.



                          Aside from the study of His Word, in what other way
                        may we know about God? Ps. 19:1.



                           "We are not to teach our children that they must not be
                        happy on the Sabbath, that it is wrong to walk out-of-doors.
                        Oh, no. Christ led His disciples out by the lakeside on the

                        into the open air, under the noble trees, into the garden; and

 THINK IT THROUGH          What are good Sabbath missionary activities? How
                        can I best use the gift of the Sabbath as a means of
                        developing my Christian experience and that of my

                             How would you distinguish between "training" and
                          "education"?


                             "The training of children must be conducted on a different
                          principle from that which governs the training of irrational

                             Is God's government one of coercion? Gen. 2:16,
                          17; 3:6.


                             The government of God has no place for coercion. He sets
                          before us some natural alternatives and then allows us to
                          choose. Happy the child whose parents help develop in him

                          mandments, so the child must see the parents' love as the

 THINK IT THROUGH             The freedom which children, at least adolescents, so

       Judges 13:12
                          The question Manoah asked typifies the most important
                       concern a parent may have. It is strange that schools "compass
                       heaven and earth" for subjects to teach children, but largely
                       neglect the one profession that the majority enter—parenthood.
                          It is perhaps significant that the angel's reply to Manoah's
                       question dealt largely with the conduct. Can you think of
                       some problems prospective parents should solve in their own
                       lives before the child is born?

                            What family problem is represented among the signs
                        of the last days? 2 Tim. 3:2.



                           The timing of disciplinary training in the growth of the child
                        is of utmost importance. When should this training begin?
                           "The moment that the child begins to choose his own will
                        and way, that moment his education in discipline is to begin.
                        This may be called an unconscious education. It is then that

                           "It is because so many parents and teachers profess to

                            In today's world, with the emphasis on freedom of choice
                         and the importance of individual growth, the question of dis-
                         cipline and its relevancy demands serious consideration. That

                         individual development.
                            "It is the work of true education to . . . train the youth to
                         be thinkers, and not mere reflectors of other men's thought.
                         Instead of confining their study to that which men have said
                         or written, let students be directed to the sources of truth, to
                         the vast fields opened for research in nature and revelation.
                         Let them contemplate the great facts of duty and destiny,

                           What inconsistency is shown in the experience of Isaac

                           "If the parents are united in this work of discipline, the
                        child will understand what is required of him. But if the
                        father, by word or look, shows that he does not approve of
                        the discipline the mother gives, if he feels that she is too
                        strict, and thinks that he must make up for the harshness by

      Prov. 13:24    This bit of wisdom from the Proverbs is in modern times a
                        subject of considerable controversy. No doubt a connection is
                        made in the minds of many with the chastening of the Lord.

                           "The work of 'breaking the will' is contrary to the principles

                           While there does seem to be a possible connection between
                        pain and obedience, at least in the small child, the parent faces
                        the responsibility of determining when his demands are the
                        result of his own whims and when they are essential to the
                        child's welfare. We must be sure our correction of children is
                        not more for ourselves than for the children.
                            "Never correct your child in anger. An exhibition of passion
                        on your part will not cure your child's evil temper. That is
                        the time of all times when you should act with humility and
                        patience and prayer. Then is the time to kneel down with the

          Eph. 6:1, 4    of the Lord."

                            It should ever be remembered that the child's obedience to
                        the parent is qualified—"in the Lord." There may come a
                        time in a child's life when obedience to God will necessitate
                        the breaking of the family tie. But the parent also has a re-
                        sponsibility to ensure that his correction is always a step
                        toward development of a Christian character.
                            There should be a purpose in all activity related to the
                        home and children.
                            "The true teacher is not satisfied with second-rate work.
                        . . . He cannot be content with imparting to them only tech-
                        nical knowledge, with making them merely clever accountants,
                        skillful artisans, successful tradesmen. It is his ambition to
                        inspire them with principles of truth, obedience, honor, in-
                        tegrity, and purity—principles that will make them a positive

                        them, above all else, to learn life's great lesson of unselfish
                        service."—Education, pages 29, 30.
                            Perhaps the most difficult question in discipline, especially
                        when it includes correction and punishment, is that of parental
                        attitude. What two ingredients are pointed out as essential in
                        the attitude of the parent?
                            "Love has a twin sister, which is duty. Love and duty stand
                        side by side. Love exercised while duty is neglected will make
                        children headstrong, willful, perverse, selfish, and disobedient.
                        If stern duty is left to stand alone without love to soften and
                        win, it will have a similar result. Duty and love must be
                        blended in order that children may be properly disciplined."
                        —Testimonies, Vol. 3, p. 195.

                           Should children be recognized as some of the "others"
                        mentioned in the golden rule? Does this mean they should
                        get the same treatment as parents? Luke 6:31.



 THINK IT THROUGH          Justice and mercy are twin sisters who stand side by

            Gal. 6:9   So many times we reserve the promises of God's Word for
                        the work we do outside the family circle. We fail to see our
                        own home as the first and greatest mission field the world
                        affords. Which do you think would add more members to the
                        church, all of our children in the church, or the fruit of public
                        evangelism? Should we give more attention to both?

                           In the first commandment with promise, is there some
                        responsibility on the part of the parent to be worthy of
                        the honor due him? Ex. 20:12.



                           What is said about the wisdom and strength we need
                        for the duty we must perform? John 15:5.



                            "Let not one word of fretfulness, harshness, or passion
                        escape your lips. The grace of Christ awaits your demand. His
                        Spirit will take control of your heart and conscience, presiding
                        over your words and deeds. Never forfeit your self-respect by
                        hasty, thoughtless words. See that your words are pure, your
                        conversation holy. . . . Let there be peace, pleasant words,
                        and cheerful countenances.
                            "Parents cannot with safety be in any way overbearing.
                        They must not show a masterly, criticizing, faultfinding spirit.
                        . . . Patient continuance in well-doing is essential if you would

                       must be restrained, brought into captivity to the obedience

                          God has given to man the governing power of decision.
                       "Everything depends on the right action of the will. . . .

                       Satan, the relatives, or the neighbors for his own sin. "No man
                       without his own consent can be overcome by Satan. The

                           The emotions, good or bad, have a tremendous effect on the

           OF SIGHT      from glory to glory even as by the Spirit of the Lord."
          2 Cor. 3:18
                            The Christian home will be attractive, and will create a
                         love for the beautiful. "God loves the beautiful. . . . He desires
                         us to surround our homes with the beauty of natural things."
                         —The Ministry of Healing, page 370. The colors should har-
                         monize; the house must be clean and orderly, with everything
                         in its place when not in use. Pictures, curtains, and decorations
                         add loveliness and beauty; plants and flowers, fragrance and
                         charm. The home should be inviting to each member of the
                         family—a cozy place in which to live and relax, not a museum
                         to be observed only.

                           What admonition should govern all aspects of a
                         Christian home? 1 Cor. 14:40.




                            Since we think about that which we see, the TV programs,
                         photos, and pictures should be selected to create respect for
                         man and reverence for God. Books, magazines, and other read-
                         ing materials will be chosen to bring pleasure, enrich knowl-
                         edge, and inspire each member of the family.
                            The facial expression reveals our emotions. That smile on
                         the face says plainly, "Christ is in the heart."
                            "Smile, parents; smile, teachers. If your heart is sad, let
                         not your face reveal the fact."—Child Guidance, page 148.
                            A neat and tidy appearance is attractive to our loved ones.
                         It is very hard for a wife who looks sad, disheartened, and
                         unkempt to be the queen of the home. When love is in the
                         heart, the whole appearance is attractive.

                        children, and respectful words by children to their parents.

                        The Adventist Home, page 437.
                          The tone of voice means everything. The Christian's voice
                        should be cheerful, courageous, and inspiring. "There will be
                        no loud, angry talking in the home. The words will be of a
                        character to soothe and bless the hearer. . . . Take all the
                        ugly features out of the voice."—Ibid., p. 436.

                           How important is it that we place a close watch on
                        our conversations? Matt. 12:37.



                           Words are the photographs of the character. Words become
                        a part of us. The daily conversation in the home gives a
                        clearer picture of one's true character than a premeditated
                        speech. "Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speak-

                           There are other sounds in the home which must be guarded.
                        While the TV, radio, and record player make it possible to
                        bring some of the best music into the home, these media are
                        also capable of bringing the worst. "Music, when not abused,
                        is a great blessing; but when put to a wrong use, it is a
                        terrible curse."—Testimonies, Vol. 1, p. 497.
                           Parents, and not inexperienced youth, are the ones to select

                          In what frame of mind should the meals be eaten?
                       Prov. 17:22.


                          "Let mealtime be a cheerful, happy time. As we enjoy the

                        is becoming more and more polluted. "Whenever possible, it

                                                                       November 5
            Part 6    "When he was yet a great way off, his father saw
      THE SENSE OF him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck,
           TOUCH and kissed him."
        Luke 15:20
                          The sweetest way to expressing love is through the sense of
                       touch. Touching the hand, lips, embracing the companion,
                       draws husband and wife closer to each other and closer to
                       God. The sense of touch should not be divorced from love,
                       nor should it be used wholly independently of the other four
                       senses.

                           When and why should parents touch their children?


                           The baby needs to be rocked, cuddled, and held in the arms.
                        This is one reason why breast-fed babies do better as a rule
                        than those who are bottle-fed. The toddler needs a lap to
                        hold him when he is tired or lonesome. The nervous, restless
                        child is often soothed into slumber by the gentle touch of
                        mother's hand on his spine. Teen-agers need to feel father's
                        strong arm about them, mother's loving kiss to assure them
                        their parents still love and appreciate them.

                           What kind of "touch" therapy do children need at
                        times? Prov. 19:18.



                           "A great wrong is done our children when we permit their
                        faults to go uncorrected."—Child Guidance, page 236. This
                        form of touching is unique. When administered in love it
                        corrects a fault, strengthens the child's willpower and draws
                        the child closer to his parent. When given in anger it creates
                        resentment, makes the child rebellious, and builds a wall be-
                        tween parent and child.
                           All punishment is for the future, not the past. We are seek-
                        ing to help the child develop self-control.
 THINK IT THROUGH          How can I cultivate love in my home?



  "There are many who regard the sion. Let not the heart of one connected
expression of love as a weakness, and with you starve for the want of kind-
they maintain a reserve that repels       ness and sympathy. . . . Continue the
others. This spirit checks the current of early attentions. In every way encour-
sympathy. As the social and generous      age each other in fighting the battles

       FOUNDATION
     FOR EDUCATION     The parents of John lived in the country, where, in His
           Luke 1:80 wisdom, the Lord planned that John would receive his educa-
                          tion. The home was his school, and the vastness of the desert

                             Not all parents today are required to live in the desert, but
                          every parent should recognize a distinct obligation to make
                          the home the first school of the child. In effect, the home is
                          the matrix where are molded the values that will be held later,
                          and where is developed the personality which will mark the
                          child in his mature years.

                             The home should be the base for educating children.
                             "It is in the home that the education of the child is to
                          begin. Here is his first school. Here, with his parents as in-
                          structors, he is to learn the lessons that are to guide him
                          throughout life—lessons of respect, obedience, reverence, self-
                          control. The educational influences of the home are a decided

                         children in all of the basic activities of life, and have a won-

                           In the education of the Israelites, much attention was given
                        to training each child in some practical trade. No matter what
                        role he might follow in later life, he was always capable of
                        supporting himself by his hands.

                           What is said about the necessity of teaching the youth

                           This lesson points to a knowledge of God as the end and
                        purpose of education. This is the true wisdom which should
                        motivate all our educational effort. While we cannot forget
                        the necessity of learning in many fields in order to take our
                        place in this complex world, we must never lose sight of the
                        basic nature of Scripture as the foundation for other studies.
                           "The knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ expressed in
                        character is an exaltation above everything else that is esteemed

                           What is another reason for making a study of Scrip-
                        ture basic in the experience of the child, and a genuine
                        practice in the home? Ps. 119:11.


                           "There were some who sought His society, feeling at peace
                        in His presence; but many avoided Him, because they were
                        rebuked by His stainless life. Young companions urged Him
                        to do as they did. He was bright and cheerful; they enjoyed
                        His presence, and welcomed His ready suggestions; but they
                        were impatient at His scruples, and pronounced Him narrow
                        and straitlaced. Jesus answered, It is written, 'Wherewithal
                        shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto
                        according to Thy word.'"—The Desire of Ages, page 89.
                           "There was in Him nothing that responded to Satan's
                        sophistry. He did not consent to sin. Not even by a thought
                        did He yield to temptation. . . . By what means did He over-

                          Of all the lessons that can be learned from a study of nature,
                        none can be a greater benefit than the realization of the power
                        and the love of God. The realization of God as the Creator
                        makes our own re-creation seem so simple.

                        lives unto itself. No bird that cleaves the air, no animal that
                        moves upon the ground, but ministers to some other life. There
                        is no leaf of the forest, or lowly blade of grass, but has its
                        ministry. Every tree and shrub and leaf pours forth that
                        element of life without which neither man nor animal could
                        live ; and man and animal, in turn, minister to the life of tree
                        and shrub and leaf. The flowers breathe fragrance and unfold
                        their beauty in blessing to the world. The sun sheds its light
                        to gladden a thousand worlds. The ocean, itself the source of
                        all our springs and fountains; receives the streams from every
                        land, but takes to give. The mists ascending from its bosom
                        fall in showers to water the earth, that it may bring forth

                        of whom God could say, "I know him, that he will command
                        his children and his household." But in being like Abraham,
                        it is necessary to have the knowledge that makes the command-
                        ing effective to the salvation of the child. This knowledge
                        Abraham had.
                            "Some mothers are not uniform in the treatment of their
                        children. At times they indulge them to their injury, and again
                        they refuse some innocent gratification that would make the
                        childish heart very happy. In this they do not imitate Christ."
                        —The Ministry of Healing, page 390.
                            Among the other things which a child should learn as a part
                        of Christian living is the study of physiology.
                            "Parents should early seek to interest their children in the
                        study of physiology and should teach them its simpler prin-
                        ciples. Teach them how best to preserve the physical, mental,
                        and spiritual powers, and how to use their gifts so that their
                        lives may bring blessing to one another and honor to God.
                        This knowledge is invaluable to the young. An education in
                        the things that concern life and health is more important to
                        them than a knowledge of many of the sciences taught in the
                        schools."—Ibid., pp. 385, 386.
                            The parent who does not have this knowledge will find it
                        difficult to try to lead his children into habits of good living.
                        He will lack a basis for making the requirements of healthful
                        living reasonable.

                                                                       November 15
             Part 2        "Know ye not that they which run in a race run all,
      TEMPERATE IN      but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.
        ALL THINGS      And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate

      1 Cor. 9:24, 25   crown; but we an incorruptible."

                           Paul's discussion of temperance is well illustrated by point-
                        ing to the runners in the Olympic games. No doubt the games
                        were as avidly followed by some in his day as they are today.
                        These runners were looked upon with admiration then, as
                        athletes are today.
                           How fitting that young people, particularly, should think
                        of the rewards of healthful living! Beyond immediate benefits
                        there are eternal goals for us as compared to the fading laurel
                        wreath given to the victor in the ancient games. See SDA
                        Bible Commentary, Vol. 6, p. 1089, and compare 2 Tim. 4:8.
                           It is important to know the relationship that exists between
                        temperance, temptation, and sin. "The diet has much to do
                        with the disposition to enter into temptation and commit sin."
                        —Counsels on Diet and Foods, page 52.
                           While we often think of temperance in a special context,
                        that of the use of alcohol, tobacco, and narcotics, we might do
                        well to use a different word for these things—abstinence. We
                        really do not teach the temperate use of these things; to
                        understand this point better we shall give further considera-
                        tion to that phase of the question in part 3 of this lesson.

                           What is Paul's attitude toward diet and toward our
                        judgment of the diet of others? Romans 14.

             Part 3     "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of
       THE CASE FOR God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy,
        ABSTINENCE acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.

        Rom. 12:1, 2 God."
                            In making a distinction between temperance and absti-
                         nence, we need this appeal from Paul. While we are aware that
                         many people define temperance as abstinence from that which
                         is harmful and restraint in the use of that which is good, in
                         this part of the lesson we are studying actual abstinence, with
                         no thought of temperance at all. The chief appeal that gives
                         strength in this respect is this statement in Romans.

                            What experience of Daniel illustrates the strength of
                         character needed by the Christian in areas requiring
                         total abstinence? Dan. 1:8-21.



                            Alcoholic drinks are a prime example of the misuse of God's
                         benefits.
                            "Our Creator has bestowed His bounties upon man with a
                         liberal hand. Were all these gifts of Providence wisely and
                         temperately employed, poverty, sickness, and distress would
                         be well-nigh banished from the earth. But alas, we see on every
                         hand the blessings of God changed to a curse by the wicked-
                         ness of men.
                            "There is no class guilty of greater perversion and abuse of
                         His precious gifts than are those who employ the products of
                         the soil in the manufacture of intoxicating liquors. The nutri-

                         beverages that pervert the senses and madden the brain. As a
                         result of the use of these poisons, thousands of families are

            OF DIET      ye are."
         1 Cor. 3:17
                            This seems to be a foundation text for the health-reform
                         message which is so vital a part of the Advent message. It
                         provides a framework for a discussion of healthful living that
                         makes it a spiritual matter.
                            God's claim on our bodies as His temple makes the use of
                         anything which is harmful a means of defiling the temple. This
                         gives us a reason, as children of God, for discarding the harm-
                         ful.

                           What rule did Paul give for deciding what is good
                         and acceptable? 1 Cor. 10:31.




                            What connection is made between eating and glorify-

                            "To eat on the Sabbath the same amount of food eaten on

                         cially careful in regard to our diet. A clogged stomach means
                         a clogged brain. Too often so large an amount of food is eaten
                         on the Sabbath that the mind is rendered dull and stupid,
                         incapable of appreciating spiritual things."—Counsels on

                          There are some who misread God's purpose for man when
                       they conclude that the urgency of the work of the gospel, or
                       any other cause, is so great that there is no time for needed
                       rest and recreation.
                          Christ's example should be noted here. This was not simply
                       compassion on His part for the weary disciples. He knew only
                       too well that to burn oneself out in any work merely shortens
                       the useful period of a person's life.

                      and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity

                            Not all of our going must be in the field of direct missionary
                         endeavor. The life lived sacrificially in the light of God's in-
                         struction is a powerful instrument to attract others to a search
                         for direction in their own lives.
                            The experience of Isaac in being offered as a sacrifice and
                         then miraculously being delivered must have been a great and
                         positive influence on his life. Gen. 22:1-13.

                           In what way can the child's attitude toward work

                          There are all sorts of Sabbath keepers. Some are quite happy

                       is neither a burden nor an escape from life.

                       obligation and Sabbath keeping a job of religion. Still others

                           Every successful business has a definite program, a schedule.
                        Every successful home must have the same. Inasmuch as some
                        responsibilities require more time than others and all of us are
                        tempted to spend more time with certain duties than with
                        others, a budget should be made before the schedule is started.

                           What should the slow, careless worker do?



                          "There is no excuse for slow bungling at work of any char-
                        acter. . . . The one who is slow and who works at a disad-
                        vantage should realize that these are faults to be corrected.
                        He needs to exercise his mind in planning how to use the time
                        so as to secure the best results."--Christ's Object Lessons,
                        page 344.
 THINK IT THROUGH         How much time do I waste in doing things that don't
                        mean much to me or to anyone else? Am I putting off
                        doing the important things of life while waiting for "a

  EARNING MONEY that giveth thee power to get wealth."
       Deut. 8:18
                         The money one earns goes into his pocket. The money one
                      spends becomes in a very real way a part of his character. A
                      Christian parent should teach his child how to earn and to
                      spend money. In the hands of a Christian money can be a bless-
                      ing to himself and to others.
                         Man is to earn his living. Gen. 3:19. God promises to give
                      the power but not the wealth. Deut. 8:18. One should work
                      for what he gets. If he does not work, he should not eat.
                      2 Thess. 3:10.

                         When should the training for life's responsibilities
                       begin? Prov. 22:6.


                         "As soon as strength and reasoning power are sufficiently
                      developed, he [the child] should be given duties to perform
                      in the home."—The Ministry of Healing, page 401.

                          How can a child earn money?


                           The home is the ideal place. Mother is the employer and
                       the child is the employee. Mother may make out a list of
                       certain work a child can do in the kitchen, dining room, laun-
                       dry, yard, garden, and elsewhere and assign a point value to
                       each item and a cash value to each point. For example:
                           Wash dishes               2        Care for garbage         1
                           Dry dishes                1       Sweep kitchen             1
                           Wash pots and pans        2
                           Selecting the job himself gives the child a greater desire to
                       do his best, and so he learns more. Mother inspects the work
                       done and records the number of points earned each day. At
                       the end of the week she totals the number of points and mul-
                       tiplies this by the cash value and pays the employee in full. A
                       little work gets little pay. A child is not to be paid for every-
                       thing he does around the house, but he receives pay only for
                       the chores stipulated in the agreement. He is a regular em-
                       ployee in this home-school and is paid in accordance with the
                       business agreement made at the beginning of the week.
 THINK IT THROUGH         What should the individual do when he is unem-
                       ployed?

                                                                           December 2
               Part 5  "Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are
     SPENDING MONEY Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's."
          Matt. 22:21
                            Parents should teach the child how to spend his money.
                         This calls for a budget. A budget neither takes from nor adds
                         to the amount, but it does enable one to spend economically.
                         One way of teaching a child how to budget his money is to
                         divide his earnings into four parts.
                            PART ONE is for God—tithes and offerings. The child
                         should be taught that God comes first in his money and in his
                         affections. After tithe come offerings such as Sabbath School
                         offerings and other church funds.
                            PART TWO is used to supply personal needs. We might
                         begin with one inexpensive article of clothing. By the time he
                         is in his teens, he should be able to buy all his own clothes
                         with the money allowed. What is the difference between a debt
                         and an investment?
                            PART THREE is for a savings account. No business is
                         secure without some capital, and no home is secure without a
                         savings account. This is just the opposite of the charge ac-
                         count, which often costs a couple more than they realize in
                         interest, besides tempting them to overspend.

                           What instruction is given in the Bible concerning debt?
                         Rom. 13:8.


                            "We should shun debt as we should shun the leprosy."—
                         Testimonies, Vol. 6, p. 217. Debt is a handicap. It causes fric-
                         tion between husband and wife. It is worth the effort to pay
                         off the debts and start a savings account.
                            PART FOUR is the personal allowance. If every dime is
                         tagged, the child is likely to get the idea that money is simply
                         to be passed on to someone else. But if he sees that twenty-five
                         cents out of every dollar is his to spend as he pleases, he begins
                         to realize that money has value. He may make some poor
                         investments, but better lose a few quarters now than many
                         dollars later. A child learns to spend money by using it.
                            Each adult should have a personal allowance. After our
                         obligations to God and to man are cared for and something
                         laid away for emergencies, the remainder should be divided
                         between husband and wife.
 THINK IT THROUGH           How does money spending reveal character?



  "Money has great value, because it         sick. But money is of no more value
can do great good. In the hands of           than sand, only as it is put to use in
God's children it is food for the hungry,    providing for the necessities of life, in
drink for the thirsty, and clothing for      blessing others, and advancing the
the naked. It is a defense for the op-       cause of Christ."—"Christ's Object Les-

                       will require wisdom, and forethought, and constant care."
                       —Ibid. Good wholesome food should not be thrown away;
                       neither should we overeat of it. An impoverished diet is poor
                       economy regardless of the price paid.

                          Why should children learn to economize?



                          "Teach your children that God has a claim upon all they
                       possess, and that nothing can ever cancel this claim; all they
                       have is theirs only in trust, to prove whether they will be
                       obedient. . . . Habits of economy, industry, and sobriety are,
                       even in this world, a better portion for you and your children
                       than a rich dowry."—Ibid., p. 134. One way of teaching econ-
                       omy in time is to have everything returned to its place when
                       not in use. Hours are wasted in looking for lost articles. Equally
                       necessary is it to have a time (a schedule) for regular family
                       routine.

                          What kind of toys should be given to children?



                           "Do not give the children playthings that are easily broken.
                       To do this is to teach lessons in destructiveness. Let them have
                       a few playthings, and let these be strong and durable. Such
                       suggestions, small though they may seem, mean much in the
                       education of the child."—Counsels to Teachers, page 123.
                           When he grows older a child should learn to repair his toys.
                       Small repairs mean large savings. "The inability to save, in
                       little things, is one reason why so many families suffer for lack
                       of the necessities of life."—Ibid., p. 135.

               LOVE, THE HOME'S FOUNDATION 111
    "Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and everyone that loveth
is born of God, and knoweth God. He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God
is love." 1 John 4:7, 8.


   It no doubt seems trite to suggest that
love is the foundation of the home. What
is true of any home in this respect is               LESSON OUTLINE

  CHRISTIAN'S MARK
         John 13:35     We sometimes get carried away in studying the mark of
                        the beast and the seal of God, and come to believe that Sab-
                        bath keeping is the supreme indication of our discipleship.
                        While we must not ignore its importance, particularly in the
                        last days, we must heed the words of Christ that the most
                        evident mark of discipleship is love. "Said Jesus: 'Love one
                        another, as I have loved you.' How much? His love cannot
                        be told."—Testimonies, Vol. 1, p. 150. We should love others
                        well enough to give our life for a brother.
                           It is a simple matter to talk about love. But we must be
                        certain of how it is to operate in the Christian life and home

                           We should admit proudly that the raising of a family is
                        work of the highest order. The training of children is said to
                        be work of the "nicest" order committed to man. What is said

  LOVE IS CONCERN      I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore
           Jer. 31:3   with loving-kindness have I drawn thee."

                          This text sets in bold relief the first ingredient of true love
                       —CONCERN. It was concern for man's welfare that led God
                       to make the supreme gift to mankind. While the acceptance
                       of this gift must be the free choice of man, God works with
                       man constantly. Jer. 3:13, 14.
                          If we are to be as God wants us to be, this same constant
                       concern must mark our dealings with each other as parents
                       and our dealings with our children.
                          "Neither parents nor children can have peace or happiness
                       or rest of spirit in any false path. But when the fear of God
                       reigns in the heart, combined with love for Jesus, peace and
                       and joy will be felt."—Child Guidance, page 67.
                          Much of Christ's instruction was to show man how to be
                       happy (blessed).


                          Review the Beatitudes, reading "happy" instead of
                       "blessed." Matt. 5:3-12.




                          True love seeks genuine happiness for the children. Child
                       Guidance, page 135, states that true love for children will be
                       expressed by not "indulging their pride, their extravagance,
                       their love of display."

        Num. 10:31
                          The experience of Moses with Hobab is a clear illustration
                       of the second ingredient to be found where there is genuine
                       love—RESPONSIBILITY. This is another word that can be
                       slipped over carelessly. It is actually the ability to respond to
                       and satisfy a need. It is a primary evidence of God's love to
                       us, that He is able to respond to and satisfy all of our needs.
                          Happy the home which is peopled with those who are will-
                       ing to help and encourage each other.

                          How did Joseph satisfy the material needs of his
                       father and his brethren? Gen. 45:16-28.


                          Even as Joseph showed real love in caring for the brothers
                       who had so terribly wronged him, parents need to accept and
                       strengthen children who have failed.
                          "Do not withdraw your love now. That love and sympathy
                       is needed now as never before. When others look with coldness
                       and put the worst construction upon the misdeeds of your
                       boy, should not the father and mother in pitying tenderness

                       page 266.
                          Why is it so important for children to receive love
                       from parents and others?


                          "Do not treat your children only with sternness, forgetting
                           . that they are but children. Do not expect them to be
                       perfect. . . . By so doing, you will close the door of access
                       which you might otherwise have to them and will drive them

  LOVE IS EMPATHY      dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat,
          Eze. 3:15    and remained there astonished among them seven days."

                          Read the first three chapters of Ezekiel to get the setting
                       for this verse, which points out the third ingredient of love—
                       EMPATHY. This word may be unfamiliar to some. The mean-
                       ing here is the ability to put oneself into another's place, and
                       thus better understand why he acts or speaks as he does.


                         What is the secret of Christ's success as our Mediator?
                       Heb. 2:17, 18.




                          In no situation is empathy more important than in the
                       home. It might help to bridge the "generation gap" if children
                       could see the viewpoint of the parents; but let us be realistic
                       and say that parents should also concentrate on developing
                       the ability to see their children's viewpoint.
                          "Let father and mother remember that they themselves are
                       but grown-up children. . . Because of their own mistakes
                       and errors they should learn to deal gently with their erring
                       children.
                          "You may feel annoyed sometimes because your children
                       go contrary to what you have told them. But have you ever
                       thought that many times you go contrary to what the Lord
                       has commanded you to do?"—Child Guidance, pages 264, 265.

                            Few relationships known to man more meaningfully picture
                         God's love for His people than a father's love for his children.
                         One reason given for this love is that God knows us.
                            Knowledge of man's frailty and weakness seems to make an
                         added appeal, if any were needed, to the heart of God in man's
                         behalf—an appeal human parents well understand when they
                         are entrusted with the life of a helpless infant.
                            Note the characteristics of a father's love in the story of
                         the prodigal son. Luke 15:11-32.
                            This fourth ingredient of love is superlatively illustrated in
                         this story. Read comments in Testimonies, Vol. 3, pp. 102, 103,
                         and in Christ's Object Lessons, pages- 198-211.
                            As parents we need to know our children well enough to
                         recognize their shortcomings but nevertheless to give them
                         affection and understanding.
                             Self-knowledge on the part of parents is also essential, that
                         positive traits of character may be developed and weaknesses
                         overcome. This experience came to Enoch after the birth of
                         his first son: "The closer the connection with God, the deeper
                         was the sense of his own weakness and imperfection."—Pa-

       1 Cor. 13:4-7 all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things."

                           The description in these verses does not define love, but
                       it does describe the person who loves. The concept of love we
                       have been studying this week, when made a part of the life,
                       makes possible this description of the person who truly loves.

                          What part does love play in determining personal
                       behavior?


                          "Up through the roots of his affection for Christ springs an
                       unselfish interest in his brethren. Love imparts to its possessor
                       grace, propriety, and comeliness of deportment. It illuminates
                       the countenance and subdues the voice; it refines and elevates
                       the entire being."—Gospel Workers, page 123.
                          "Love is power. Intellectual and moral strength are involved
                       in this principle, and cannot be separated from it. . . . The
                       excellence and value of pure love consist in its efficiency to do
                       good, and to do nothing else than good. Whatsoever is done
                       out of pure love, be it ever so little or contemptible in the
                       sight of men, is wholly fruitful; for God regards more with
                       how much love one worketh than the amount he doeth."—
                       Testimonies, Vol. 2, p. 135.

                          How does Christ's description of the Good Shepherd
                       paint a picture of love? John 10:1-10.

          John 3:16
                           Christ came to this world to save man, but in order to do
                        this He had to portray the Father as He was in truth. God
                        was popularly pictured as a stern, unrelenting Judge, waiting
                        only for an opportunity to destroy. But Christ showed the
                        Father as loving His creatures so supremely that He emptied
                        all of heaven for their salvation. The sense of giving as the
                        great expression of love could not be more clearly shown. Be-
                        cause love is the very atmosphere of heaven, and love is giving,
                        Christ was anxious to teach men that only by giving can they
                        truly demonstrate love.

                             How did Christ, the Son, cooperate with the Father
                         in this great gift? Phil. 2:5-8.




 THINK IT THROUGH            In what ways might I teach my children, in a prac-

     EXPRESSION OF      of Nazareth rise up and walk."
      LOVE'S POWER
            Acts 3:6       Our thoughts on giving are quite naturally connected with
                        the question of stewardship, and stewardship is too often re-
                        lated quite largely to money.
                           The giving we shall discuss this week includes the money
                        we give for the support of all worthy causes in God's work,
                        but it is not limited to that. The experience of Peter in healing
                        the lame man is a fine illustration.
                           The great joy in giving comes from the ability to do or to
                        serve, to inspire or to sympathize.

                          Mention some examples of Jesus' gifts of teaching,
                        healing, and blessing. Luke 8; John 8.




                            What is said about the greatest joy for angels? "The angels
                        of glory find their joy in giving."—The Desire of Ages, page 21.
                            What characteristics are suggested as the elements of the
                        power of love? "Christian courtesy . . . has power to soften
                        natures which would grow hard and rough without it. The
                        cultivation of a uniform courtesy, a willingness to do by others
                        as we would like them to do by us, would banish half the
                        ills of life."—The Adventist Home, page 421.

     GREATEST GIFT      cross, and follow Me. For whosoever will save his life
                        shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for My sake
     Maft. 16:24, 25    shall find it."

                           The greatest gift we can give to Christ, or to others, is
                        the gift of self. The person who enters into marriage with
                        reservations, not giving himself wholly to his companion, is
                        doomed to disappointment. The person who does not give of
                        himself freely to his children is depriving them of a real need
                        and cheating himself of true joy.

                           What type of consecration did Paul recommend?
                        1 Thess. 5:23.


                           Note the comment in Counsels to Teachers, page 249, about
                        the meaning of giving ourselves and the taking of Christ's
                        cross:
                           "It is the will of God that each professing Christian shall
                        perfect a character after the divine similitude. By studying the
                        character of Christ revealed in the Bible, by practicing His
                        virtues, the believer will be changed into the same likeness of

                           What message is sent to young people on this sub-
                        ject?


                            "His death ought to stir every fiber of the being, making us
                        willing to consecrate to His work all that we have and are. As
                        we think of what He has done for us, our hearts should be
                        filled with love."—Messages to Young People, page 315.
 THINK IT THROUGH          How can I find the line between giving myself so
                        completely to my children that they never learn the joys
                        of giving, and teaching them the meaning of giving of
                        one's self?


   "A great work is to be accomplished together in obedience to the truth.

       THINE HEART
         Prey. 23:26  The greatest gift Christ asks of His followers is the gift of
                        the heart. In more modern language, we would say that He
                        demands the gift of the will. We must surrender the will to
                        Him. And yet, in the surrender, He in effect returns it to us,
                        but now with the assurance that He will strengthen us to use
                        that will in His service.

                           What is the result of looking to the Lord for strength?
                        Isa. 27:5.



                           Of what importance is the will? John 7:17.



                           In the work of the parents in training the children, the will
                        of the parents must be brought into "submission to the will
                        of God."—The Adventist Home, page 213. Youth are espe-

                        notwithstanding the moral pollution that abounds, that cor-

 THINK IT THROUGH           The hope of the parent to see the full surrender of the
                        child's will to Christ, is almost invariably measured by
                        the depth of the parent's surrender, as seen in the life.
                        How does a parent teach the idea of personal surrender
                        to his children?

                           How diligent should the Christian be in seeking the
                        Lord? Jer. 29:13.




                           The knowledge of God demands the concentration of the
                        whole being in seeking and finding Him. Study the parable

                        tellect is quickened to think, and the soul is charged with
                        ambition to succeed. One can do his best when he is cheerful.

                            What effect does cheerfulness have on children?


                           "Children hate the gloom of clouds and sadness. Their
                        hearts respond to brightness, to cheerfulness, to love."—Child
                        Guidance, page 147. Seldom does a child disobey a cheerful
                        parent. He wants to please. He likes to make his parents
                        happy. He is quick to obey a smile, but slower in responding
                        to a sad, gloomy face. He must hear the same request over and
                        over when the parent is anxious or worried. A cross parent
                        must threaten punishment to get results. The mind is capable
                        of the highest performance when one is cheerful. "Smile, par-
                        ents; smile, teachers. If your heart is sad, let not your face
                        reveal ithe fact."—Ibid., p. 148.

                           What effect does cheerfulness have on one's com-
                         panion?


                           A cheerful wife is the admiration and joy of her husband.
                        She can inspire him to be his best. A sad, tear-stained face
                        kills his desire to make good and usually brings out the mean-
                        est spirit in him. A cheerful husband is the life of the home.
                        He adds health and beauty to his wife. A glum husband can
                        drive a wife to despair.

                            How essential is cheerfulness to salvation? Ps. 13:5, 6;
                         Phil. 4:4.


 THINK IT THROUGH          Would the child who leaves his home in a cheerful
                        frame of mind make better progress in school than the
                        child who is neglected or constantly scolded by his par-

                           How will Christian courtesy affect teen-agers?




                           "There is great need of the cultivation of true refinement

                             The Christian can be confident, for he accepts the Word of
                          God as his infallible guide. This is the only way anyone can
                          be confident. Wealth, power, prestige, or location cannot

             Part 4        "But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and His righ-
     BE CONSISTENT      teousness; and all these things shall be added unto you."
          Matt. 6:33
                           Any home without a definite objective will fail of worth-
                        while achievement. Without a purpose there is nothing to
                        achieve. If the main objective is to accumulate wealth, expen-
                        ditures will be cut to the minimum and incomes accelerated
                        to the maximum. If the main desire is to have a hilarious time,
                        work will be forgotten and duties neglected while time is
                        spent in merrymaking.

                           What is the advantage of regularity in the home?




                           "Irregularity has created disorder in your house, and, if
                        continued, will cause your mind to sink into imbecility."—

                        Letter 297, 1904. "Ministers of Christ should possess physical
                        health. To attain this end they must become regular in their
                        habits and adopt a healthful system of living."—Counsels on

          BE COM-      love."
       PANIONABLE
         1 John 4:8      "There are many who regard the expression of love as a
                       weakness, and they maintain a reserve that repels others. . . .
                       We should beware of this error. Love cannot long exist without
                       expression."—The Ministry of Healing, page 360.
                         "Continue the early attentions. In every way encourage each
                       other in fighting the battles of life. Study to advance the hap-
                       piness of each other. . . . The warmth of true friendship, the
                       love that binds heart to heart, is a foretaste of the joys of
                       heaven."—Ibid. Relatives, friends, business, or pleasure should
                       not be allowed to interfere with the family companionship.

                          What is the father's responsibility?



                          "Fathers, spend as much time as possible with your chil-
                       dren."—The Adventist Home, page 222. "Combine affection
                       with authority, kindness and sympathy with firm restraint.
                       Give some of your leisure hours to your children; become
                       acquainted with them; associate with them in their work and
                       in their sports, and win their confidence. Cultivate friendship
                       with them, especially with your sons. In this way you will be
                       a strong influence for good."—The Ministry of Healing, pages
                       391, 392.

                          What is the mother's opportunity?



                          "Amid all the activities of life the mother's most sacred
                       duty is to her children."—The Adventist Home,. page 234. "No

               Part 6    "And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in
        BE CHRISTLIKE favor with God and man."
            Luke 2:52
                          "Every child may gain knowledge as Jesus did."—The De-
                       sire of Ages, page 70. He can be given the same kind of care
                       and training Jesus received. Few, indeed, will have poorer par-
                       ents or live in a worse neighborhood. Yet He was "filled with
                       wisdom." His education was the best. His mother taught Him
                       herself from infancy. The Old Testament and nature were His
                       main textbooks. He "increased in stature." His physical needs
                       were cared for. With plenty of work to keep Him busy He
                       grew as a normal boy should. He was "in favor with God."
                       He pleased His heavenly Father in the same way children can
                       please Him today. He was "in favor with man." He was kind
                       and courteous to his playmates and respectful to His elders.

                          Was Jesus a precocious child?



                          "His mind was active and penetrating, with a thoughtful-
                       ness and wisdom beyond His years. Yet His character was
                       beautiful in its symmetry. The powers of mind and body
                       developed gradually, in keeping with the laws of childhood."
                       —Ibid., p. 68. Although He had a tremendous task to perform
                       and had only a limited time in which to accomplish it, He
                       lived the full life of the infant, the child, the teen-ager, and
                       the youth that He might be the perfect example to children
                       as well as to adults.

                          Why does it take a child so long to reach maturity?


                          The growing period is the learning period. Ample time is
                       given to permit the lessons to become fixed habits. Each plateau
                       of learning prepares the child for the next step. True education
                       prepares "the student for the joy of service in this world and
                       for the higher joy of wider service in the world to come."—
                       Education, page 13.

        Thirteenth Sabbath Overflow Offering
           December 25, 1971 Far Eastern Division
    This 'quarter the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering overflow goes to
the Far Eastern Division—a division offering a variety of situations,
from the steaming jungles of New Guinea, Borneo, and Sumatra
to the modern sophistication of Djakarta, Singapore, and Tokyo.
The gospel must reach all these areas, and this Thirteenth Sabbath
Offering will help make it possible. These are the projects:
     1. Mission launch for Borneo. The launch will be based at
        Samarinda, the provincial capital on the Mahakam River,
        where there is a Seventh-day Adventist church, school, and
        clinic, and from there make regular trips upriver, entering
        new areas with medical help and the gospel.
     2. Lamb Shelters. These are to provide simple meeting places
        for children in the smaller churches which now have no place
        to conduct Sabbath School, Vacation Bible School, et cetera.
     3. Hong Kong Adventist Hospital. This hospital will offer first-
        class medical care. Most of the funds needed have been raised
        by public solicitation. This Thirteenth Sabbath Offering over-
        flow will help complete the project.
     There would be today no mission schools, hospitals, and evange-
 listic centers had it not been for the interest, prayers, and generosity
 of our Sabbath School members around the world. It is the small,
 systematic, and sacrificial contribution of the individual member
 which, multiplied by many thousands, produces these marvelous
 offerings. The people of the Far East are praying for your help this
 Thirteenth Sabbath.
