         The Blessing of Daily Study
   "Every day some portion of time should be appropri-
ated to the study of the lessons, not merely in learning to
mechanically repeat the words, while the mind does not
comprehend the meaning; but to go to the very founda-
tion, and become familiar with what is brought out in the
lesson."—Counsels on Sabbath School Work, page 53.




                      My Pledge
   As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge
of the Scriptures, I pledge myself to the careful and
prayerful study of some portion of my Sabbath School
lesson each day of the week.

                    SECOND QUARTER, 1971


    Place of writing and date: "Having exercised his rights as a Roman citizen
and appealed to Caesar, Paul was sent to Rome, where he probably arrived
in the spring of A.D. 61. Here he was a prisoner for two years. Thus it is likely
that this epistle was written about A.D. 62."—SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 6,
p. 994.
    Historical background: "Paul wrote this epistle in times and surroundings
that well form a background to his message. The bloody Nero was emperor;
licentiousness, luxury, and murder were rampant. It is recorded, for example,
that when L. Pedanius Secundus, a senator of Rome, had been murdered by
a slave, in accordance with legal rights some 400 slaves of his household were
condemned to death in retribution."—Ibid.
    Theme: "This book of the New Testament . . . may be described as a
solemn contemplation of the lofty privilege into which God's eternal purpose
has brought believers in Christ, followed by an exhortation to conduct worthy
of this high calling. Beneath this simple structure of the epistle and pervading
the whole is the fully developed conception of Christ as central in the universe
and in history."—Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1946 ed., article, "Epistle to the
Ephesians."
    Relevance: This letter was written during the closing days of Paul's min-
istry, while he was a prisoner in Rome. See The Acts of the Apostles, page
176; Testimonies, Vol. 5, p. 730. His great burden was that the believers
should stand firm and that they should all come into "the unity of the faith,
and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the mea-
sure of the stature of the fullness of Christ." Eph. 4:13.
    "These messages, written with a power not of man but of God, contain
lessons which should be studied by all and which may with profit be often
repeated. In them practical godliness is outlined, principles are laid down
that should be followed in every church, and the way that leads to life eternal
is made plain."—The Acts of the Apostles, pages 470, 471.

              Part 1      "Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God,
     SALUTATION OF    to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in
    THE APOSTLE PAUL Christ Jesus: Grace be to you, and peace, from God our
                      Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. Blessed be the
                      God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed
           Eph. 1:1-3 us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ."

                            "The will of God." This gave Paul a strong conviction of
                         divine calling. He uses the expression at least six times to the
                         churches. (1 Cor. 1:1; 2 Cor. 1:1; 2 Tim. 1:1; Eph. 1:1;
                         Col. 1:1.)
                            By direct mandate of Christ he had been chosen (Acts
                         9:5-15), and by diligence and the grace of God he continued
                         his witness till his death (2 Tim. 4:7). He undoubtedly was,
                         after Christ, the gospel's greatest exponent and model church
                         leader.
                            "Saints." This is an early use of this word in the sense of
                         "Christians" (Acts 9:13), and occurs in all his epistles except
                         Thessalonians and Galatians and those written to individuals.
                            "Blessed." He blesses God, who has blessed the saints "with
                         all spiritual blessings." This comprehensive statement would
                         doubtless include the doctrinal revelations such as adoption,
                         resurrection, and immortality, as brought to light in the gospel.
                            "Paul carried with him the atmosphere of heaven. All who
                         associated with him felt the influence of his union with Christ.
                         The fact that his own life exemplified the truth he proclaimed,
                         gave convincing power to his preaching."—The Acts of the
                         Apostles, pages 510, 511.
                            What is the meaning of "an apostle of Jesus Christ"?
                         Can each believer live every day "by the will of God"?
                         What were the characteristics of a "saint" of Paul's
                         day? From what kind of world had the "faithful" come?
                         Eph. 1:1.

       CHOSEN FOR foundation of the world, that we should be holy and
        SALVATION without blame before Him in love: having predestinated
          BY GOD us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to Him-
                     self, according to the good pleasure of His will, to the
                     praise of the glory of His grace, wherein He hath made
         Eph. 1:4-6 us accepted in the Beloved."

                           "Through Him He picked us out before the creation of the
                       world, to be consecrated and above reproach in His sight in
                       love. He foreordained us to become His sons by adoption
                       through Christ Jesus, to carry out the happy choice of His
                       will, so that we might praise the splendid favor which He has
                       shown us in His beloved Son."—Charles B. Williams.
                           The Greek verb from which we get the meaning "to deter-
                       mine beforehand" occurs in Rom. 8:29, 30 and Eph. 1:5, 11.
                       God foresaw those who would accept the conditions of salva-
                       tion. These He calls, justifies, glorifies. See Rom. 8:30.
                           "By Jesus Christ." All that God does for us is through Jesus
                       Christ. Paul labored to "present every man perfect in Christ
                       Jesus." Col. 1:28. It is God's will that all should be adopted
                       into the Christian family.
                            "We ourselves owe everything to God's free grace. Grace in
                        the covenant ordained our adoption. Grace in the Saviour ef-
                        fected our redemption, our regeneration, and our exaltation to

           Eph. 1:7, 8
                             Redemption comes by the voluntary sacrifice of Christ and
                         by the voluntary faith of man in that sacrifice. Christ's death
                         was unique. The life sacrificed for humanity was without sin
                         (1 Peter 1:19), and it provided a "ransom for all." Not even
                         one is excluded. 1 Tim. 2:6.
                             Faith in the blood of Christ produces peace (Col. 1:20) and
                         cleanses from sin. 1 John 1:7. We overcome by its power. Rev.
                         12:11.
                             "Dear brother, dear sister, when Satan would fill your mind
                         with despondency, gloom, and doubt, resist his suggestions. Tell
                         him of the blood of Jesus, that cleanses from all sin. You
                         cannot save yourself from the tempter's power, but he trem-

                             There is no magic in the shed blood. There is a twofold
                         miracle involved in the process of salvation. First, that divine
                         love provided the incarnation and shedding of Christ's blood
                         for all men. Second, that through faith in the death on Calvary's
                         cross, man could repent, confess, find conversion, and thus pass
                         from sinner to saint. From this miracle he finds divine grace
                         to abound "in all wisdom and prudence."

    THINK IT THROUGH        As we contemplate the grandeur of the plan of re-

                                                                          March 31
            Part 4      "Having made known unto us the mystery of His will,
    AMAZING PLAN according to His good pleasure which He hath purposed
     MADE KNOWN in Himself: that in the dispensation of the fullness of
                     times He might gather together in one all things in
                     Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on
       Eph. 1:9, 10 earth; even in Him."

                          Sin caused disunion. God's plan was to restore unity be-
                       tween heaven and earth. Sin was the cosmic tragedy, and
                       today it is the Number One problem in the world. But God
                       has purposed that in time unity will be restored between
                       heaven and earth.
                          "The mystery of His will" is made known to man in its
                       broad essentials without explicit mention of all the means used,
                       which means man could not in his finite state understand. Paul
                       speaks of "my knowledge in the mystery of Christ." Eph. 3:4.
                       He received by revelation sufficient for the edification of the
                       saints (Gal. 1:12; Col. 1:25), but elsewhere he acknowledges
                       human limits to comprehension of infinite things. 1 Cor. 13:9-12.
                          "Fullness of times. . . . The entire gospel age seems to be
                       comprehended. As there are appropriate times for the sowing
                        of the seed and the gathering of the harvest, there are also
                       suitable seasons for God's activities in connection with the
                        redemption of men. There are some things that could be ac-
                        complished at one time and not at another, because He is deal-
                        ing with beings who are free moral agents whom He will not
                        even attempt to force into compliance with His purposes.
                        Through the ages there have been successive unfoldings of the
                        plans of God, stages of development leading up to the final
                        consummation when there will be a universal unity."—SDA
                        Bible Commentary, on Eph. 1:10.
                            Who only was the author of the plan to bring unity
                        into the universe? When was this plan to be made opera-
                        tive? Who was its center? When will it be completely
                        fulfilled? Eph. 1:10.

Challenging Truths for All Times           LESSON 1                     ❑ Thursday
                                                                               April 1
                Part 5    "In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, be-
           BELIEVER'S ing predestinated according to the purpose of Him who
        INHERITANCE worketh all things after the counsel of His own will: that
              SECURE we should be to the praise of His glory, who first trusted
         Eph. 1:11, 12 in Christ."

                           Here Paul pursues the great theme of the divine purpose,
                        the sovereign will of God in working out the ultimate triumph
                        of righteousness over evil. We have a present inheritance, how-
                        ever, and we are to give thanks for it. Col. 1:12.
                            In some cases this inheritance is both here and in the here-
                        after. Mark 10:30. Study the use of the word "inheritance" as
                        it applies to our inheritance among the saints (Acts 20:32 ;
                        26:18), the present token (earnest) of more to come (Eph,
                        1:14).
                           Mention some qualities of the inheritance of the saints
                        through Christ's resurrection. 1 Peter 1:3, 4. For more
                        on rewards and inheritance see Mark 10:29, 30.

                           "To the praise of His glory" or its equivalent is used three
                        times. Eph. 1:6, 12, 14. Is this praise just word of mouth, or
                        what more is involved in the phrase "that we should be to the
                        praise of His glory"?
                           "An immense sacrifice was made on the part of God's dear
                        Son, that He might have power to rescue fallen man and exalt
                        him to His own right hand, make him an heir of the world and
                        a possessor of the eternal weight of glory. Language fails to
                        express the value of the immortal inheritance. The glory, riches,
                        and honor offered by the Son of God are of such infinite value
                        that it is beyond the power of men or even angels to give any
                        just idea of their worth, their excellence, their magnificence."
                        —Testimonies, Vol. 2, p. 40.
                           How is the believer's inheritance made secure? Who
                        has decided that the believer is to have an inheritance?
                        Does the will of God have something to do with the
                        bestowal of the inheritance? Eph. 1:11.



 THINK IT THROUGH          Do you think we value our Christian inheritance as
                        intensely as did these first believers? By what means can
                        we obtain this vivid sense of inheritance?

                                                                                April 2
             Part 6        "In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the
       SEALED WITH      word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also
         THE SPIRIT     after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that Holy
        OF PROMISE      Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance
                        until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto
        Eph. 1:13, 14   the praise of His glory."

                            "The word of truth" must here include all that Paul means
                        in Romans 1:16—the whole gospel, of which he was unashamed.
                            How did they hear this word? It was the apostles' exposition
                        of the Christian gospel based on the Scriptures of their fathers.
                        This was Christ's own method of preaching the word of truth.
                        See Luke 24:27. Today men are seeking for truth from many
                        sources other than the Inspired Word.
                            "The truth is more than a collection of statements of fact,
                        which would hay.e no salvation in them as such; the truth
                        must finally bring us to Him who is 'the way, the truth, and
                        the life' (John 14:6). Every noble impulse that arises in any
                        man's soul, Christian or heathen, springs from that one Source.
                        Indeed, the influence of the Holy Spirit is necessary to the
                         effective reception of the truth (1 Cor. 2:12-15). . . .
                            "There is an orderly change in the believer's life: first there
                         is the hearing, then the believing, and then the sealing that puts
                         upon him, as it were, an impression or stamp."—SDA Bible
                         Commentary, on Eph. 1:13.
                             "The heart must be emptied of every defilement and
                         cleansed for the indwelling of the Spirit. It was by the con-

                        this work? How does the ministry of the Holy Spirit relate
                        to the inheritance? Eph. 1:13.

        Eph. 1:15, 16
                           Paul was quick to notice spiritual growth on the part of the
                        believers (1 Thess. 1:8; 2 Thess. -1:3, 4), and to express his
                        appreciation, as shown in the text before us. Believers respond
                        positively to words of appreciation. Appreciation finds entrance
                        to the heart. Understanding is of great value in stimulating
                        spiritual growth. "Wherefore" or "for this cause" refers to
                        previous comments, such as verse 8, where the wisdom and
                        prudence of the Ephesian Christians are mentioned.
                           How could the faith of the Ephesians have been re-
                        ported for Paul and others to hear about it? Why should
                        Paul be concerned about the welfare of these churches?

                          This letter was written from a Roman prison, and Paul had
                        reason to wonder about a church "consisting of Jews and
                        Gentiles, Asiatics and Europeans, slaves and freemen—all sym-
                        bols of a disrupted world that was to be restored to unity in
                        Christ."—SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 6, p. 995.
                          As Paul heard of the Christian growth of the believers,
                        what was he led to do? Eph. 1:16.




                           "Paul carried with him the atmosphere of heaven. . . . The
                        fact that his own life exemplified the truth he proclaimed, gave
                        convincing power to his preaching. Here lies the power of truth.
                        The unstudied, unconscious influence of a holy life is the most
                        convincing sermon that can be given in favor of Christianity.

 THINK IT THROUGH           Is the disunity of the world reflected in our individ-

                       to God as "Father" (John 17:1), "Our Father" (Luke 11:2),
                       "My heavenly Father" (Matt. 18:35). These many expressions
                       identify Jesus with humanity. Thus "the Father of glory" is
                       both "the God of our Lord Jesus Christ" and "My God, and
                       your God." John 20:17.
                          "The Father of glory" suggests Stephen's "the God of
                       glory." Acts 7:2. The glory is part of the inheritance of the
                       saints in Eph. 1:18. Does the church always present the picture
                       of a group of saints in whom some form of this glory is seen?
                           "Wisdom and revelation." Does it require wisdom to under-
                       stand the revelation of God? Does it require divine guidance
                       to comprehend the revealed Word? Is this a reason for constant
                       and regular study of the Word in which God's wise plan of
                       salvation is revealed?
                           "It is contrition and faith and love that enable the soul to
                       receive wisdom from heaven. Faith working by love is the key
                        of knowledge, and everyone that loveth `knoweth God.' 1 John
                        4:7."—The Desire of Ages, page 139.

                         What gifts does Paul pray for, for the Ephesians? By
                       praying to God for these gifts, what does he recognize?

                          "But there must be earnest study [of the Scriptures] and
                       close investigation. . . . And we cannot expect to gain spiritual
                       knowledge without earnest toil. Those who desire to find the

                        "I pray that your inward eyes may be illumined, so
                     that you may know what is the hope to which He calls
                     you, what the wealth and glory of the share He offers
          Eph. 1:18 you among His people in their heritage." NEB.

                           The apostle prays that the believers may be ever mindful
                        of the significance of hope as a principle of life here and as a
                        reward and privilege in the hereafter. The Lord Jesus is our
                        hope. 1 Tim. 1:1. God is our guide and protector as we walk
                        through life. We follow the truth of God as our way of life.
                        Then at the end our hope for eternity will be fulfilled in the
                        second coming of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
                           What is your understanding of the phrase: "Know
                        what is the hope of His calling"? Does the hope of your
                        calling inspire and encourage you?

                           Paul also prays that the believers remember the riches God
                        has for them. Humanity is attracted to riches, but it shuns
                        poverty. The lesson for us is to put our trust in God's riches
                        which are our inheritance. Qualitatively and quantitatively
                        God's riches amaze us as they are lavished on the believer by
                        an eternal and loving heavenly Father. Guidance into truth by
                        the Holy Spirit (John 16:13), redemption through the blood
                        of Jesus (1 Peter 1:18, 19), the mediatorial ministry of Christ
                        (1 Tim. 2:5), and everlasting life and happiness in the earth
                        made new are but a few of the riches which God has showered
                        on the believer.
                           Name some riches of our God not mentioned in the
                        paragraph above.

 THINK IT THROUGH          In view of the times we live in, and in view of the
                        grace and love of God to the believer, what should be

                       raised Him from the dead, and set Him at His own right
       Eph. 1:19, 20   hand in the heavenly places."

                            What analogy do you see between the resurrection power
                        in the case of Jesus, and "the exceeding greatness of His power
                        to usward"? How would you contrast the power required to
                        overcome weakness and sin in the believer and that required
                        to raise Jesus from the dead? Does the conquest of sin figure
                        in both cases?
                            "This same resurrection power is that which gives life to
                        the soul 'dead in trespasses and sins.' Eph. 2:1. That spirit of
                        life in Christ Jesus, 'the power of His resurrection,' sets men
                        'free from the law of sin and death.' Phil. 3:10; Rom. 8:2. The
                        dominion of evil is broken, and through faith the soul is kept
                        from sin. He who opens his heart to the Spirit of Christ be-
                        comes a partaker of that mighty power which shall bring forth
                        his body from the grave."—The Desire of Ages, pages 209, 210.
                            "Christ became one flesh with us, in order that we might
                         become one spirit with Him. It is by virtue of this union that
                        we are to come forth from the grave,—not merely as a mani-
                         festation of the power of Christ, but because, through faith,
                         His life has become ours. Those who see Christ in His true
                         character, and receive Him into the heart, have everlasting
                         life. It is through the Spirit that Christ dwells in us; and the
                         Spirit of God, received into the heart by faith, is the beginning
                         of the life eternal."—Ibid., p. 388.
                           What assurance is given to struggling believers in
                        these verses? What is the proof of God's mighty power
                        in our lives? Could it be the condition described in 1 Cor.

         MAJESTY OF in this world, but also in that which is to come."
     HIS EXALTATION
            Eph. 1:21   Every form of power is here intended. The ancient world
                        feared many "powers," good and evil. The stars represented
                        to them powers of all kinds. Angelic and demonic powers were
                        legion to them. For believers, the coming of Christ into the
                        world banished the fear of all evil powers, for Christ is Lord of
                        all. Compare Rom. 8:38, 39.
                           The heathen gods were graded, some greater or more evil
                        than others. Christ is "above all." Compare "angels, nor prin-
                        cipalities, nor powers" (Rom. 8:38), "angels and authorities
                        and powers" (1 Peter 3:22), et cetera.
                           The worship of angels appeared in some forms of later Ju-
                        daism, and the Christian leaders warned against this. (Col.
                        2:16-18. To them, Christ was the Supreme Person in the
                        universe, sitting at the right hand of God. Ps. 110:1. His name
                        is above every name and has an influence which cannot be
                        estimated for greatness. Revelation 5.
                           "His [Christ's] resurrection is a pledge of the resurrection of
                        the saints (Rom. 4:25; 1 Cor. 15:20-22), and His exaltation
                        a pledge of the final exaltation of the saints."—SDA Bible
                        Commentary, on Eph. 1:20.
                           "The same power that raised Christ from the dead will raise
                        His church, and glorify it with Him, above all principalities,
                        above all powers, above every name that is named, not only
                        in this world, but also in the world to come."—The Desire of

                          How is the power of Christ compared to the other
                        powers in the universe? Compare Heb. 1:2, 3.




 THINK IT THROUGH          The power of God is implied in the very name of

       Eph. 1:22, 23       "In this passage these words fill up the picture of our Lord's
                        transcendent dignity, by the declaration of the actual subjuga-

                           Should this give courage to Christ's church on earth
                        today? In what way is "the church, which is His body"
                        affected by your exemplification of the Lordship of Christ?




                           "He walks in the midst of His churches throughout the
                        length and breadth of the earth. He watches them with intense
                        interest to see whether they are in such a condition spiritually
                        that they can advance His kingdom. Christ is present in every
                        assembly of the church. He is acquainted with everyone con-
                        nected with His service. He knows those whose hearts He can

                           In the plan of Heaven God-chosen men were to carry on
                        the work of the church under the direction of Deity. Jesus
                        chose twelve as those who should begin this ministry.
                           "These men He purposed to train and educate as the leaders

     SIN MADE ALIVE        "Buried with Him in baptism, wherein also ye are
                        risen with Him through the faith of the operation of God,
                        who hath raised Him from the dead. And you, being
                        dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh,
            Eph. 2:1;   hath He quickened together with Him, having forgiven
        Col. 2:12, 13   you all trespasses."
                           Whereas we were "dead in trespasses," we are now dead or
                        irresponsive to the promptings of sin. Does this mean that we
                        are no longer subject to temptation from hereditary human
                        nature? Or does it mean that we now have power to resist

                        from mortal to immortal?

                        His people from their sins, so Christ has raised fallen human
                        beings from spiritual death, quickening them with His life,

                           What experience comes to the sinner after his sins
                        have been forgiven? Through whom and by what process
                        does forgiveness come?

                           Forgiveness is a great act of divine mercy. Christ has brought
                        us a wonderful blessing in forgiveness. He is the only one who
                        can give us forgiveness. Acts 5:31; 4:12; 1 John 1:7, 9. For-
                        giveness comes in response to repentance, the first step in turn-
                        ing to God. Acts 3:19. We receive forgiveness through the
                        blood of Jesus. Matt. 26:28.
                           The believer after receiving forgiveness has a duty to others.
                        "Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors."
                           "Nothing can justify an unforgiving spirit. He who is un-

 THINK IT THROUGH          When others offend us, what should the attitude of the

           Part 2        "Wherein in time past ye walked according to the
      WORLDLINGS course of this world, according to the prince of the power
          BEFORE; of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of

                      desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature
        Eph. 2:2, 3 the children of wrath, even as others."

                           In verse 2 Satan is indicated as responsible for the evil course
                       of this world. He claimed power over the world. Luke 4:6. He
                       is the great adversary and tempter of man. 1 Peter 5:8; 1 Thess.
                       3:5. He is the enemy. Matt. 13:39. He is the deceiver of the
                       whole world. Rev. 12:9. He is the father of lies. John 8:44.
                           In verse 3 the word "all" must include both Jews and
                       Gentiles. All are guilty before God. In the first chapter of
                       Romans there is an extensive exposition of the guilt of man
                       in the evil course of this world. "For the wrath of God is
                       revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteous-
                       ness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness." Rom. 1:18.
                       All through the exposition of evil in Romans 1:19-32 the per-
                       sonal pronoun is used to indicate the responsibility of men for
                       the evil in their lives.
                           Before becoming believers in the Lord, in what kind
                        of world had they walked? Explain the responsibility for
                        evil in the world.

                           In The Desire of Ages, pages 36 and 37, there is an extensive
                        description of the world of the first century, from which a
                        few excerpts are taken:
                           "The deception of sin had reached its height. All the agencies
                        for depraving the souls of men had been put in operation."
                        "Bewildered and deceived, they were moving on in gloomy
                        procession toward eternal ruin,—to death in which is no hope
                        of life, toward night to which comes no morning." "The senses,
                        the nerves, the passions, the organs of men, were worked by
                        supernatural agencies in the indulgence of the vilest lust." "Sin
                        had become a science, and vice was consecrated as a part of
                        religion."
 THINK IT THROUGH          Meditate on the wonder of the plan of redemption
                        through Jesus Christ. Should we concentrate on what we
                        were in the past, or on what the present and future offer
                        us in Christ? Eph. 2:7.

                           Quickened. . . . This word . . . and its simpler form . . .
                        refer to a change from death to life, a rebirth, a new life. As
                        Christ was quickened from the grave, so man is quickened
                        from spiritual death. It is God's purpose to bring man into a
                        new sphere, a new relationship in which he is governed by new
                        principles."—SDA Bible Commentary, on Eph. 2:5.
                           "Heavenly places." "If we are raised together with Christ,
                        and are 'in Christ Jesus,' and Christ is at the right hand of
                        God in heaven, then we, in that sense, are sitting with Him
                        in heaven."—/bid., on Eph. 1:3.
                           "God's love has been expressed in His justice no less than
                        in His mercy.. . . It had been Satan's purpose to divorce mercy
                        from truth and justice. He sought to prove that the righteous-
                        ness of God's law is an enemy to peace. But Christ shows that
                        in God's plan they are indissolubly joined together; the one
                        cannot exist without the other. . . .
                           "By His life and His death, Christ proved that God's jus-
                        tice did not destroy His mercy, but that sin could be forgiven,
                        and that the law is righteous, and can be perfectly obeyed.
                        Satan's charges were refuted."—The Desire of Ages, page 762.
                           Are the riches of God's grace extended to man in the

                            How does the apostle describe salvation in Rom. 8:24,

                            "Hope is an essential element of our salvation and must

                         with Him who promises; but hope is occupied with the good
                         things promised. Faith appropriates; hope anticipates. It is in
                         the power of this hope which the New Testament calls `that

                         sin, likeness to Christ, and the full revelation of our sonship
                         to God in Him (1 Cor. 15:51-57 ; Phil. 3:20, 21; 1 Thess. 4:15-

                             "He [Christ] saw that the weakness, the curse of the church,
                         would be a spirit of self-righteousness. Men would think they
                         could do something toward earning a place in the kingdom of
                         heaven. . . . Thus there would be an abundance of self and
                         little of Jesus. Many who had made a little advancement would
                         be puffed up and think themselves superior to others. They
                         would be eager for flattery, jealous if not thought most im-

                                                                               April 15
             Part 5        "For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus
     GOOD WORKS—         unto good works, which God hath before ordained that
     GOD'S PURPOSE       we should walk in them."
           Eph. 2:10
                           This verse shows clearly the reason why and where "good
                         works" figure in the Christian life. Christ initiates everything
                         by His grace, abolishing all enmity and uniting us, from what-
                         ever background, in one with Him. See verse 15.
                             What would men say to a new man created by Christ
                         if he did evil works? Do good works flow from man's will
                         to be good, or from inward Christian motives? Gal. 2:20.

                            "By their good works, Christ's followers are to bring glory,
                         not to themselves, but to Him through whose grace and power
                         they have wrought. It is through the Holy Spirit that every
                         good work is accomplished."—Thoughts From the Mount of
                         Blessing, page 80.
                            Is a man saved by his good deeds?

                            Where faith in the righteousness of Christ is the dominating
                         factor, then, good works always follow. Various aspects of good
                         works are seen in the following quotations:
                            "Each has his place in the eternal plan of heaven. Each is
                         to work in cooperation with Christ for the salvation of souls.
                         Not more surely is the place prepared for us in the heavenly
                         mansions than is the special place designated on earth where
                         we are to work for God."—Christ's Object Lessons, pages 326,
                         327.
                            "The rich Christian has a special opportunity to serve his

                            "The rich Christian is entrusted with a solemn responsibility.
                         The way he handles wealth will affect his spiritual cleyclopment

                         Commentary, on 1 Tim. 6:18.
                            "God calls for those who will be workers together with
                         Him. . . Christ supplies the efficiency, and man becomes a
                         power for good. Truthfulness and integrity are attributes of
                         God, and he who possesses these attributes possesses a power
                         that is invincible."—Messages to Young People, page 35.

                         Does this accentuate the necessity for, or the futility of,
                         good works? Heb. 10:24, 25.


    "No one can give place in his own        the sea suffer no loss thereby. That
heart and life for the stream of God's       which they give is repaid a hundred-

                             Does the victory of the gospel over these Gentiles have any

                          participate in the worship of the true God. . . . They failed to

                          Jews.

                           These verses complement the great passage on reconciliation
                        in 2 Cor. 5:18-21. The word "reconcile" shows two parties once
                        united, then separated by sin-,—alia now brought together again.
                        This involves the harmonious original creation, the fall, the
                        incarnation, and the whole plan of atonement.
                            "The reconciliation of God to man, and man to God, is sure
                        when certain conditions are met."—Fundamentals of Christian

                        preached peace; "He is our peace." Eph. 2:14. This peace in
                        our hearts is not just a pacific sentiment. It involves action in
                        the battle against sin—surrender to Christ, witness against

         Eph. 2:19       Membership in the household of God is "the goal of God's
                      ways with mankind! . . . For this end Jew and Gentile are
                      being gathered into one and compacted into a new humanity."
                      —The Expositor's Bible, Vol. 6, p. 39.
                         Note that whereas the figure used in verse 19 is that of a
                      household, in verse 20 it becomes a building, with "Jesus Christ
                      Himself being the chief cornerstone." Thanks be to the Father
                      for the "household of God"!
                         "Strangers and foreigners. . . The strangers . . were aliens,
                      but the foreigners . . . were half-aliens, residents having no
                      rights of citizenship and more properly called 'sojourners' (see
                      Acts 7:6, 29)."—SDA Bible Commentary, on Eph. 2:19.
                         "Household of faith. That is, the church (see 1 Sam. 3:15;
                      Eph. 2:19; 1 Peter 4:17). The church has an obligation to all
                      men everywhere (see Matt. 28:19, 20), but first to its own
                      members. This is true both in spiritual and in material matters.
                      The church cannot serve the world acceptably unless its own
                      house is in order."—Ibid., on Gal. 6:10.
                         From the chaos of a world divided into Jews, Gentiles,
                      strangers, foreigners, et cetera, Paul passes into an orderly
                      community for which he uses the words fellow citizens, saints
                      (holy ones), household of God. This all recalls God's original
                      plan to make Israel "an holy nation." Ex. 19:6. God can wait
                      and can change the details of His plans, but He always carries

        Eph. 2:20, 21   groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord."

                           Here the heterogenous group of Jews, Gentiles, strangers,
                        foreigners, become the household of God. Paul's favorite meta-
                        phor for this change is "the temple of God," or the church as
                        a "building fitly framed together," et cetera.
                           Jesus expressed one of the great principles of the kingdom
                        when He said: "I will build My church; and the gates of hell
                        shall not prevail against it." Matt. 16:18. The believers in all
                        ages should be assured by this declaration. Compare 1 Cor.
                        3:9-17; 2 Cor. 6:16, where the unity of the church of Christ is
                        the great burden of the apostle.
                           "The prophets to whom God revealed the riches of His grace
                        and the apostles, the special evangels of this grace, constitute
                        the foundation. Other Christians make up the structure of the
                        building. This passage does not say that the church was to be
                        founded on one apostle, Peter, but upon all of them, with
                        Christ, the Chief Cornerstone.
                           "Chief corner stone. This expression is found only here and
                        in 1 Peter 2:6, where the building is described as made of liv-

                        together an edifice. Christ holds together the various parts of
                        the spiritual house, giving shape and unity to it. The metaphor
                        is drawn from Ps. 118:22 and was applied by Christ to Him-
                        self (Matt. 21:42)."—SDA Bible Commentary, on Eph. 2:20.
                           In 1 Peter 2:6, cited from Isaiah 28:16, we have "a Chief
                        Cornerstone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on Him shall
                        not be confounded."
 THINK IT THROUGH           Does the church today owe anything to the builders
                        of the past? 1 Cor. 3:6, 7; Heb. 1:1, 2.

  A CONTRIBUTING tion of God through the Spirit."
      COMMUNITY
        Eph. 2:22   We have seen how the apostle has traced the experience of
                       the believers in spiritual victories. They have been reconciled,
                       have access to the Father, are members of the "household of
                       God," they have a firm foundation, and then finally they are
                       informed that the community "groweth."
                          Now the apostle challenges them with the part they are to
                       act in the growth of the church. They are to be a contributing
                       community. They are called upon to perform their part in
                       making the "habitation of God." In 1 Peter 2:5, 9 they are
                       "lively stones" and "a chosen generation." What do all these
                       metaphors mean to you about believers? Do they convey the
                       idea of the importance and value of the church and the re-
                       sponsibilities of the believers?
                          Believers are to understand that they can build the church
                       by their influence for God, by good works to those in need, by
                       their testimony to others, by their faithful support of the
                       church, by fidelity to God and obedience to His Word.
                          "This building [the first temple] represents God's spiritual
                       temple, which is composed of material gathered out of every
                       nation, and tongue, and people. . . . They are living stones,
                       quarried out from the world by the truth; and the great
                       Master-Builder, the Lord of the temple, is now hewing and
                       polishing them, and fitting them for their respective places in
                       the spiritual temple. . . .
                          "The care shown in the building of the temple [of Solomon]
                       is a lesson to us regarding the care that we are to show in our

                           "For this cause." That is, because of the solid foundations
                        and beauty of Christ's church. This phrase occurs in verse 14
                        and in Titus 1:5, and in no other place in the New Testament.
                        Because of the blessings that have come to the community of
                        the saints, Paul prays for more.
                           "Dispensation of the grace of God." Does this mean his con-
                        version, his imprisonment, his preaching power to the Gentiles,
                        or his knowledge of truth?
                           Paul's example of prompt and unreserved obedience to his
                        commission can be followed (1 Cor. 11:1) by all of us in the
                        church. We shall do well to read again the references made to
                        his call to duty on the Damascus road (Acts 9:3-31; 22:6-21;
                        26:12-19) and meditate on the Christian principles involved.
                        To imitate his example will bring freshness and enrichment to
                        our Christian experience.

          Eph. 3:3-6   takers of His promise in Christ by the gospel."

                          Jews had no more extra privileges. Gentiles would suffer no
                       discrimination. The gospel now was to know no national bor-
                       ders. To the apostle this had been revealed by the Holy Spirit.
                       He now makes public announcement. Fellow heirs! Fellow
                       saints! Both are admitted to the church on equal footing; both
                       are children of God. Both would suffer with Christ and both
                       would reign with Him. Rom. 8:14-17; Gal. 3:29.
                           What truth does the apostle now announce? To whom
                       was this truth revealed along with Paul? By whom was
                       it revealed? What three privileges did this revelation
                       give the Gentiles?


                           "The Saviour longed to unfold to His disciples the truth re-
                       garding the breaking down of the 'middle wall of partition'
                       between Israel and the other nations. . . . This truth was re-
                       vealed in part at the time when He rewarded the faith of the
                       centurion at Capernaum, and also when He preached the gospel
                       to the inhabitants of Sychar. Still more plainly was it revealed
                       . . . when He healed the daughter of the Canaanite woman.
                       These experiences helped the disciples to understand that among
                       those whom many regarded as unworthy of salvation, there
                       were souls hungering for the light of truth.
                           "Thus Christ sought to teach the disciples . . . that in God's
                        kingdom there are no territorial lines, no caste, no aristocracy.
                       . . . But not until later did they realize in all its fullness that
                        God `hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell

                       19, 20.
 THINK IT THROUGH         What can the individual Christian, whatever his social
                       or racial background, do today to eliminate the walls of
                       partition? Does the greeting of Ananias to Saul ("Brother

           EXPLAINED      working of His power."
             Eph. 3:7
                             Paul was made a minister by divine appointment. Compare
                          Col. 1:23. The gospel ministry is a gift and an obligation. It is
                          an honor and will be rewarded. 1 Peter 5:2-4. He testifies to the
                          working of God's power in his experience. His conversion as
                          one who persecuted the saints was indeed extraordinary. He
                          recognized the working of the power of God in his call to the
                          ministry and his subsequent success. 1 Cor. 2:4; 2 Cor. 6:6.
                          He came to realize that the strength of God was "made perfect
                          in weakness." 2 Cor. 12:9.
                             "Here, in the solitude of the desert, Paul had ample oppor-
                          tunity for quiet study and meditation. He calmly reviewed his
                          past experience and made sure work of repentance. He sought
                          God with all his heart, resting not until lie—krieiv—for a certainty
                          that his repentance was accepted and his sin pardoned. He
                          longed for the assurance that Jesus would be with him in his
                          coming ministry. He emptied his soul of the prejudices and
                          traditions that had hitherto shaped his life, and received instruc-
                          tion from the Source of truth. . . .
                             "When the mind of man is brought into communion with
                          the mind of God, the finite with the Infinite, the effect on body
                          and mind and soul is beyond estimate. In such communion is

                             "Throughout his later ministry, Paul never lost sight of the
                          Source of his wisdom and strength."—Ibid., p. 128.
                              How graciously did Paul acknowledge Peter's success
                          in labor for Christ? Gal. 2:8, 9: "Wrought effectually in
                          Peter." Compare Eph. 3:7, where Paul spoke of his own
                          work. Does grace make us gracious to all other men?
                          Does this build up Christ's church? Eph. 1:9-12.



  THINK IT THROUGH          As we consider Paul's devotion to the cause of God
                         and his earnestness in its work, what does his example
                         inspire us to be and do?

        Eph. 3:8, 9 created all things by Jesus Christ."

                          Paul here presents the grandeur of the mission. He remembers
                       his persecution of the saints (1 Cor. 15:9), his human frailty,
                       his need of grace for the monumental task. He is amazed at
                       the truth he is to preach, its unity, its regenerating power. He
                       is to "make all men see" the importance of the gospel. 2 Cor.
                       5:10, 11. He is to develop fellowship and brotherhood in a
                       world of animosity and division.
                          "Even these words [Deut. 4:5-8] fail of expressing the great-
                       ness and the glory of God's purpose to be accomplished through
                       His people. Not to this world only but to the universe are we
                       to make manifest the principles of His kingdom."—Testimonies,

                           God uses men who have made mistakes, but who have re-
                       pented. Consider the case of the apostle Peter:
                            'Send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon.' Thus God
                       gave evidence of His regard for the gospel ministry and for
                       His organized church. The angel was not commissioned to tell
                       Cornelius the story of the cross. A man subject, even as the
                       centurion himself, to human frailties and temptations, was to
                       be the one to tell him of the crucified and risen Saviour.
                           "As His representatives among men, God does not choose
                       angels who have never fallen, but human beings, men of like
                       passions with those they seek to save. Christ took humanity
                        that He might reach humanity."—The Acts of the Apostles,
                        page 134.
                          How did Paul consider himself? What were the two
                       characteristics of the message Paul was to preach to the
                       Gentiles? How long had this truth been hidden from the
                       notice of the world? See lesson texts.



 THINK IT THROUGH          Is there something for the church to learn from the
                       call, the humility, the earnestness, and the success of the
                       apostle Paul? Mention a few lessons we ought to learn
                       from Paul's experience.

      2 Tim. 1:11, 12   Him against that day."

                            In verse 10 Paul speaks of life and immortality brought to
                        light through the gospel, and now refers to that gospel "where-
                        unto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher."
                        These titles are referred to elsewhere relating to the glorious
                        gospel "committed to my trust." 1 Tim. 1:11; 2:7. Compare
                        Eph. 1:1.
                            He loved the people. 1 Cor. 16:24. He served the Lord with
                        humility. Acts 20:19. He was diligent and untiring in his
                        labors. 1 Thess. 2:9. He was not covetous. Acts 20:33. He
                        preached the cross of Jesus Christ. 1 Cor. 2:2. He depended on
                        the prayers of the church. Rom. 15:30-32. He carried a burden
                        for all the churches. 2 Cor. 11:28. He was always planning
                        advance in the Lord's work. Rom. 15:24.
                            "The apostle felt that he was to a large extent responsible
                        for the spiritual welfare of those converted under his labors.
                        . . . Often in his ministry he would meet with little companies
                        of men and women who loved Jesus, and bow with them in
                        prayer, asking God to teach them how to maintain a living
                        connection with Him. Often he took counsel with them as to
                        the best methods of giving to others the light of gospel truth."
                        —The Acts of the Apostles, page 262.
                           Describe some of the principles used by Paul in his
                        work. Are they valid and relevant to the work of the
                        gospel today? (For example, assurance of divine call;
                        also, a sense of God's power, as in Eph. 1:19.)

                                                                             April 30
             Part 6       "I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course,
     ENDURING THE      I have kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up for me

      THE MISSION      Judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but
       2 Tim. 4:7, 8   unto all them also that love His appearing."

                          Note some of the sufferings of the apostle as he carried out
                       his mission. They will give understanding of this wonderful
                       man as he carried on "in Christ." Jesus told His disciples that
                       they would be hated, persecuted, scourged, driven from one city
                       to another. "If they have persecuted Me, they will also perse-
                       cute you." John 15:20. See Matt. 10:17, 22. The apostle Paul
                       had his full measure of persecution and abuse. Acts 14:19, 20;
                       16:23 ; 2 Tim. 3:11 ; 2 Cor. 11:23-27. Do you think we in the
                       church today are ready for a repetition of this kind of persecu-
                       tion?
                          "Without money, without friends, without counsel, the aged
                       prisoner stood before Nero—the countenance of the emperor
                       bearing the shameful record of the passions that raged within;
                       the face of the accused telling of a heart at peace with God.
                       Paul's experience had been one of poverty, self-denial, and
                       suffering. Notwithstanding constant misrepresentation, reproach,
                       and abuse, by which his enemies had endeavored to intimidate
                       him, he had fearlessly held aloft the standard of the cross. Like
                       his Master, he had been a homeless wanderer, and like Him, he
                        had lived to bless humanity."—The Acts of the Apostles, pages
                       493, 494.
                            How many times was Paul beaten with stripes? With
                        rods? How many times was he stoned? How many times
                        was he shipwrecked? What was Paul's reaction to per-
                        secution for Christ's sake? 2 Cor. 11:23-30. Is persecu-
                        tion an unmixed evil or a blessing to the Christian and
                        to the church? Matt. 5:11, 12.




 THINK IT THROUGH          Compare Col. 1:25, 26 and Eph. 1:1, 9 (the call of God
                        to Saul of Tarsus) with today's lesson scriptures, and say

      Eph. 3:12, 13
                          "Boldness" was in speech and witness, as opposed to vain
                       boasting. Paul knew the cause of his tribulation was his preach-
                       ing the gospel. Col. 4:3; Phil. 1:13; 2 Tim. 2:8, 9. Bonds spread

                       together for good." Rom. 8:28.
                          "The Faith of Him. . . . We can come to God with boldness

                          "Faint. . . . The apostle in prison was anxious that his flock
                       be not disturbed by his plight. He was concerned, not so much
                       for his own sake, but for theirs. They might conclude that what
                       he had preached had little saving power in it; that the God in
                       whom Paul trusted was unmindful of His servant's fate; that
                       they themselves might soon face similar trials. Suffering cou-
                       rageously borne is doubly glorious when both onlookers and
                       sufferers draw virtue from it.
                          "Your glory. Paul, like a good pastor, identifies himself with
                       his flock. If he finds glory in his tribulation, they will share it
                       with him. He is suffering on account of his exalted office as
                       apostle and ambassador of God, and the Ephesians are the fruit
                       of that apostleship. Hence they are entitled to reflect the glory."

         TO PRAYER      and earth is named."
       Eph. 3:14, 15
                           The thought interrupted in verse 1 is resumed in verse 14.
                        The apostle's prayer acknowledges that all the saints, Jews
                        and Gentiles, are stones in the same temple. Eph. 2:19-22. He
                        expresses the grand reconciliation by Christ of all in the church.
                           Paul's admonition, "Be ye followers of me, even as I also
                        am of Christ" (1 Cor. 11:1), applies at least in part to his
                        example of dependence on prayer.
                           An enriching idea is introduced with the mention of the fam-
                        ily of God. This gives new honor to the family of the re-
                        deemed.
                           "The whole family. . . . Paul appears to be speaking of unity
                        and seems to conceive of the beings in heaven and the saints on
                        earth as one large family. If the translation 'every family' is
                        adopted [instead of 'the whole family'] it seems necessary to
                        conceive of several families in heaven. Such the Scriptures do
                        not describe. It seems better therefore to adopt the reading 'the
                        whole family,' which conveys the sense of unity and whole-
                        ness of the community of God, the Father of all, a theme to
                        which the apostle frequently reverts."—SDA Bible Commen-

        Eph. 3:18, 19
                           The goal of the apostle for the saints is to know the love of
                        Christ experimentally. His love for us is dynamic (Gal. 2:20) ; it
                        impels to duty (2 Cor. 5:14) ; it has a relation with the com-
                        mands of Jesus (John 15:10) ; and it is abundant (1 Tim.
                        1:14). The love of Christ is of fundamental importance to all
                        believers in their conversion and growth in spiritual things.
                           "May be able. The subject to be grasped is beyond ordinary
                        comprehension; therefore Paul prays that his hearers may re-

                        How does the love of Christ affect our lives? Can we love

                        words filled the church with high spiritual courage as they
                        realized the approaching dangers (Acts 20:29, 30), persecutions
                        in the present and future (2 Thess. 1:4), and in the great task
                        of building up the work of God (Eph. 2:21, 22). "God is able"
                        has been the cry of the people of God through the centuries.
                        Dan. 3:17; Matt. 3:9; 2 Cor. 9:8. We know He is able also
                        in our day.
                           "The Lord Jesus seeks the cooperation of those who will
                        become unobstructed channels for the communication of His
                        grace. The first thing to be learned by all who would become
                        workers together with God is the lesson of self-distrust; then
                        they are prepared to have imparted to them the character of
                        Christ....
                           "It is not the highest work of education to communicate
                        knowledge merely, but to impart that vitalizing energy which
                        is received through the contact of mind with mind, and soul

                        with His power? Ps. 23. What is the connection between

                     forbearing one another in love; endeavoring to keep the
          Eph. 4:1-3 unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace."

                            The groundwork of unity is the personal relationship be-
                         tween each believer and the "one God, the Father ... ; and one
                         Lord Jesus Christ." 1 Cor. 8:6. The apostle now calls the atten-
                         tion of the believers to the components of the Christian way
                         in some detail: lowliness, meekness, long-suffering, forbearance.
                         In his writings mention is made frequently of the calling of the
                         believer. 1 Cor. 7:20; Phil. 3:14; 2 Thess. 1:11; Heb. 3:1.
                         Gracious Christian practice is to endeavor "to keep the unity
                         of the Spirit." Effort and diligence through the grace of God
                         bring unity.
                            "The apostle exhorts his brethren to manifest in their lives
                         the power of the truth which he had presented to them. By
                         meekness and gentleness, forbearance and love, they were to
                         exemplify the character of Christ and the blessings of His
                         salvation."—Testimonies, Vol. 5, p. 239.
                            "The meekness and lowliness of Christ is the Christian's
                         power. It is indeed more precious than all things which genius
                         can create or wealth can buy. Of all things that are sought,
                         cherished, and cultivated, there is nothing so valuable in the
                         sight of God as a pure heart, a disposition imbued with thank-
                         fulness and peace."—Ibid., Vol. 4, p. 559.
                            What does the apostle emphasize as the concern of the
                         believer? Eph. 4:3. Describe what he writes about the

 THINK IT THROUGH           Was unity of great importance only for the church of
                         Paul's time, or is it likewise needed in the church today?

                     of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift
         Eph. 4:4-7 of Christ."

                            "One body. . . . The Christian is not a solitary pilgrim; he
                        belongs to a vital organism, the family of God. This unit re-
                        places the state, the club, and even the human family as the
                        supreme object of his attachment.
                            "One Spirit. . . . The Spirit dispels the divisions within a

                        Holy Spirit is absent.
                            "One hope. . . . The Spirit validates this hope. . . Such a
                        hope necessarily leads to the transformed life. . . .
                            "One Lord. . . Those who give complete submission and
                        allegiance to the same Lord are not at enmity with one another.
                        He is Lord by creation and by re-creation, and all authority
                        rests with Him... .
                            "One faith. Paul seems here to be speaking of subjective faith
                        in Christ as a personal Saviour rather than of faith as a creedal
                        system. . . . There is only one means of salvation, namely,
                        faith....
                            "One baptism. Baptism by water aptly symbolizes death
                        and resurrection. Also, it signifies cleansing and separation, and
                        is a public announcement of union with the body of Christ.
                        Those thus initiated into the visible church grow together into
                         the likeness of Christ's death and resurrection (Rom. 6:3-5).
                            "One God and Father of all. . . . The common Father is the
                        source of all unity. The greatest fact that the human heart can
                         discover is that God is a Father who can be trusted, one who
                         is a friend to man."—SDA Bible Commentary, on Eph. 4:4-6.
                           Describe these seven concepts which support Christian
                        unity and their relation to the individual believer. What
                        additional concept is given by the apostle in verse 7?

                        warnings against those whose actions tend to disrupt or

                        Wisdom and power (1 Cor. 1:24; Rom. 1:16) are given for the

                        provoking suggestions (1 Peter 5:2, 3). What is to be the atti-

                        measure of the stature of men and women in Christ Jesus.
                        Daily they prayed for fresh supplies of grace, that they might

                        followers must make straight paths for their feet, lest that

                        labor for God must work intelligently to replenish the defi-

                            What goal does the apostle hold before the church
                        members and the ministry? In what way should the min-
                        istry and the believers work and worship together? How
                        zealous were those at Pentecost in cooperating with the

                          Christians should be alert for deception. Paul often men-
                       tions this seriously. 1 Cor. 3:18, 19; 15:33; 2 Tim. 3:13, 14;
                       Col. 2:8.
                           Growth in spiritual things is a goal set before believers. It
                       is a part of the advantages to be reaped from unity in the
                       Spirit. Paul thanks God for one of the churches which has
                       grown in faith. 2 Thess. 1:3. To another he recommends grow-
                       ing as a part of Christian experience. Col. 1:10. He urges unity
                       as essential. See 1 Thess. 3:12, 13.
                          "The greatest deception of the human mind in Christ's day
                       was that a mere assent to the truth constitutes righteousness.
                       In all human experience a theoretical knowledge of the truth
                       has been proved •to be insufficient for the saving of the soul. It
                       does not bring forth the fruits of righteousness."—The Desire

                          "Self-righteousness is not true righteousness, and those who
                       cling to it will be left to take the consequences of •holding a
                       fatal deception. Many today claim to obey the commandments
                       of God, but they have not the love of God in their hearts to
                       flow forth to others."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 279.
                          "There can be no life without growth. The plant must either

                   maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself
        Eph. 4:16 in love."

                           The church is an institution that is to experience growth
                        and enlargement. Increase, enlarge, grow, advance, and build
                        were the ideals Paul cherished. Growth of the whole body was
                        to be accomplished through the efforts of the parts. He had
                        seen the church enlarge from Palestine and Syria to Asia Minor
                        (Acts 13), from Asia to Macedonia (Acts 16:9), and from
                        Macedonia to Achaia (1 Thess. 1:7). In true apostolic style
                        and courage he places before the Ephesian believers this image
                        of the future.
                           "Fitly joined together" is the same as "fitly framed to-
                        gether," as bonded together in a building. This is a striking
                        symbol for church unity. The body is compacted by the con-
                        tribution provided by every single joint or member.
                           "Fitly joined. . . . Growing up into Him assures vitality
                        flowing from Him into the members of the body, which are
                        closely joined together. It is thus that persons of greatly varying
                        gifts are able to work together. . . .
                           "Maketh increase. . . . It is a twofold increase—growth of
                        the church in numbers and of the individual in the spiritual

                           Describe the goals of the apostle as expressed in our
                        Scripture. How had the gospel gone from country to coun-
                        try in the time of Paul as described in the texts in the
                        above paragraph? Of what did the final objective of the
                        apostle consist?



 THINK IT THROUGH            According to our text, how is the worldwide mission

 ABANDON THE OLD henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity
                    of their mind, having the understanding darkened, being
                    alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that
                    is in them, because of the blindness of their heart: who
                    being past feeling have given themselves over unto
      Eph. 4:17-19 lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness."

                            "This I say . . . , and testify" is typical of Paul's earnest
                         adjuration of the saints. Compare "I take you to record" (Acts
                         20:26), and "I testify . . . to every man" (Gal. 5:3). His deep
                         convictions often called on God as witness. Rom. 1:9; 2 Cor.
                         1:23. "Testify in the Lord" again indicates his conviction that
                         he was speaking with divine authority.
                            "Vanity" is the way of the world, as in 1 Cor. 3:20 also.
                         What the world calls wisdom is often ignorance and darkness.
                         It alienates men from God.
                            "Blindness of their heart" is sometimes rendered "hardness,"
                         indicating guilt for such a condition. Compare Mark 8:14-21,
                         where ignorance and hardness appear in the same connection.
                            Would the phrase "who being past feeling," indicate
                         a condition beyond redemption?




                             The whole point of this passage is that Christians should
                         turn round and go in a new moral direction.
                            "The apostle admonishes his brethren, in the name and by
                         the authority of the Lord Jesus, that after having professed
                         the gospel they should not conduct themselves as did the Gen-
                         tiles, but should show by their daily deportment that they had
                         been truly converted."—Testimonies, Vol. 5, pp. 171, 172.
                            How is the worldly way of life described? What are
                         believers admonished not to do? Eph. 4:17; 1 Peter 1:14.




 THINK IT THROUGH           How is our way of life, our manner of living, related
                         to the work we do? What is to be our attitude to "old

    OLD WAY NOT        have heard Him, and have been taught by Him, as the
LEARNED OF CHRIST      truth is in Jesus: that ye put off concerning the former
                       conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to
        Eph. 4:20-22   the deceitful lusts."

                           "Learned Christ" implies not the use of a magical name, but
                       to come to know both Christ and His way of life. When Paul
                       wrote of putting on the Lord Jesus Christ (Rom. 13:14), that
                       was another way of expressing the adoption of a new way of
                       life. It was not merely knowledge but a new moral attitude to
                       life.
                           "The sins that were practiced before conversion, are to be
                       put off, with the old man. With the new man, Christ Jesus, are
                       to be put on 'kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-
                       suffering.'"—Sons and Daughters of God, page 300.
                           There must be detachment from the old man, and attach-
                       ment to the new man in Christ Jesus. No compromise was
                       possible between the new man and the old. There was to be
                       no possible status of "peaceful coexistence" between them.
                           "Conversation" in our text means "manner of life, habitual
                       behavior, or personal conduct."
                           "Learned Christ. . . . To have 'learned Christ' is not merely
                       to have learned something about Him; it is to have become
                       acquainted with His office and work as priest, prophet, king,
                       advocate, and mediator, and to have appropriated for one's life
                        the benefits of His atoning work. When Jesus Himself said
                        `learn of Me' (Matt. 11:29), He was presenting Himself as the
                       example; here He is offered, not as the great teacher, but as
                        the very object of knowledge and faith."—SDA Bible Com-

                           How was the teaching of Christ related to the Gentile
                        way of life? What was the attitude of the believers to
                        the teaching of Christ? What was to be the attitude
                        toward the "old man"?

                        "new man"? How often do we need to put on the "new

Putting Off the Old, Putting On the New             LESSON 8          ❑ Wednesday
                                                                               May /9

  PUT AWAY LYING truth with his neighbor: for we are members one of an-
      AND ANGER other. Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down
      Eph. 4:25-27 upon your wrath: neither give place to the devil."

                             This epistle contains a series of motivating Christian prin-
                         ciples, and also a series of prohibitions. It is popular to decry
                         prohibitions as negative, but often it is as important to know
                         what we must and will not do, as it is to know what we will
                         do. For example, before any situation arises, we know that we
                         must not lie. If we are members of the body of Christ, practic-
                         ing or speaking falsehood to each other is impossible. The word
                         "neighbor" is not limited to fellow Christians. Luke 10:29 and
                         following verses.
                             "Be ye angry, and sin not." See Ps. 4:4, margin. Here is an
                         exhortation joining anger with sinlessness. What kind of anger?
                         "It is a righteous indignation against sin, which springs from
                         zeal for the glory of God, not that anger prompted by self-love
                         or wounded ambition, which is referred to in the scripture, 'Be
                         ye angry, and sin not.'"—Testimonies to Ministers, page 101.
                             "Then Paul gives the reason for telling the truth. It is be-
                         cause we are all members of the same body. We can only live
                         in safety because the senses and the nerves pass true messages
                          to the brain. . . If, for instance, they told the brain that
                         something was cool and touchable when in fact it was hot and
                          burning, life would very soon come to an end. . . . All decep-

                          Barclay, Letters to the Galatians and Ephesians, on Eph. 4:25,
                          page 184.
  THINK IT THROUGH          What specific sins named in this lesson are to be put
                         away from the life of the new man? Compare "the wrath
                         of God" and the anger of man. What is the exhortation
                         with regard to anger? How does anger "give place to
                         the devil"? Prov. 15:18.



                              Do we know from Christian moral principles what we
                          shall or shall not do in a given situation, or do we wait
                          for a difficult situation to arise, and then act on the spirit
                          of the moment? How is righteous indignation identified?




   "It is true there is an indignation that   any supposed provocation feel at lib-

                        the Greek cities—from its profligate and criminal classes—the
                        gospel had drawn its converts (comp. 1 Cor. vi.9-11). In the
                        Ephesian church there were converted thieves; and Christian-

                        Vol. 6, p. 74, on Eph. 4:28. See also 1 Cor. 6:10; 1 Peter 4:15.
                           "Corrupt communication." Here is a graphic prohibition
                        against inappropriate speech. The gift of speech is to be used
                        to edify, to build up spiritual life.
                           "The right culture and use of the power of speech has to do
                        with every line of Christian work; it enters into the home life,
                        and into all our intercourse with one another. We should ac-
                        custom ourselves to speak in pleasant tones, to use pure and
                        correct language, and words that are kind and courteous. Sweet,
                        kind words are as dew and gentle showers to the soul. The
                        Scripture says of Christ that grace was poured into His lips
                        that He might 'know how to speak a word in season to him
                        that is weary.' Ps. 45:2; Isa. 50:4. And the Lord bids us, 'Let
                        your speech be alway with grace' (Col. 4:6) 'that it may min-

                        for stealing? Eph. 4:28. To what place will the thief never
                        be admitted? 1 Cor. 6:10.




 THINK IT THROUGH           How should the believer give counsel or correction to
                        his brother? What is given as a good rule in conversation?
                        Would you say that the vast outpouring of words in our

                       each of them replaced by the corresponding graces of the new

                       Eph. 4:25 to 5:6. The "works of the flesh" (Gal. 5:19) include
                       some of the sins here mentioned.
                          Note how Paul passes from the impurities of the inner heart
                       in verse 3 to their outward expression in verse 4.
                          Covetousness: "Everywhere its slimy track is seen. It creates
                       discontent and dissension in families; it excites envy and

                       is hindered in its course; the scorn of worldlings is kindled by

                           Why were the believers counseled not to talk about
                        the sins of their former lives? What was to take the place
                        of these conversations? Who would not be allowed to

                             Vain words: In cities like Corinth and Ephesus there were
                          temples dedicated to the gods maintained by the proceeds of
                          prostitution of priestesses, et cetera. Some philosophers argued
                          the reasonableness of these things since they had always been
                          done. Thus were people deceived "with vain words." Philosophy
                          of many kinds deceives men today. The Bible has much to say
                          about deception of all kinds. See Heb. 3:13; Gal. 6:7; 2 Tim.
                          3:13, 14.

           OF LIGHT     of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and
          Eph. 5:8, 9   truth)."

                           Paul often contrasted the past heathen life of believers with
                        their present Christian life. See Rom. 11:30; Col. 3:7. In Eph.
                        4:17-20 he speaks of their former darkened understanding and
                        their present enlightenment in Christ. "What communion hath
                        light with darkness?" (2 Cor. 6:14) is the same contrast. As an
                        illustration of the Christian life, the apostle uses the word
                        "walk." Walk in "newness of life," "honestly," "in the Spirit,"
                        "in wisdom." Rom. 6:4; 13:13; Gal. 5:16; Col. 4:5. The apostle
                        John makes it clear that there is a precious reward to those
                        who walk in the light. 1 John 1:7. Our identification is clear
                        from our "walk," or manner of life.

                         how were they to "walk," or what was to be their manner
                         of life? Explain the connection of the Spirit with the

 THINK IT THROUGH            Is it essential that religious knowledge and practice
                         should flourish together? See Matt. 21:28-31. Can incon-

                         an inconsistent professing Christian obtain the happiness
                         of real daily experience with Christ? John 14:21, 23.

              Part 5       "Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord."
         ACCEPTABLE
            TO GOD         In Rom. 12:2 the apostle speaks of proving "what is that
           Eph. 5:10
                        good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God." To prove God's
                        promises we must accept and obey.
                           "What is acceptable unto the Lord" becomes the intent of
                        obedience. By trial in their experience, in prayer, in the study
                        of the Word, in communion with and contemplation of the
                        Master, Christians are to learn "what is acceptable unto the

                           "Proving. . . . The Christian must be continually testing
                        the good, the right, and the true with the intent of finding out
                        what is pleasing to God (Rom. 12:2). The will of God as re-
                        vealed in His Word and in experience is the touchstone by
                        which the testing and approving is to be done. 'What would
                        Jesus do?' becomes an important question continuously in the
                        mind of the believer."—SDA Bible Commentary, on Eph. 5:10.
                           "Acceptable unto the Lord." In Rom. 12:2 Paul speaks of
                        proving the "good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God."
                        The only way we can prove the good things of God is to be
                        sincere in accepting them. Phil. 1:10. Accepted things in this
                        way become more and more acceptable.
                            Who is the Lord of our lives? See John 13:13; Phil 3:8.
                        What is to be the great standard by which our conduct
                        is to be judged?




 THINK IT THROUGH          Define the meaning of being "acceptable unto the
                        Lord." How does this relate to God's will? How can we
                        know whether or not our lives are acceptable? See Acts
                        24:16; 2 Cor. 1:12.

Walk in the Light       LESSON 9                                             ❑ Friday
                                                                                May 28
               Part 6      "And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of
            THE TEST    darkness, but rather reprove them. For it is a shame even
            IS LIGHT    to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.
                        But all things that are reproved are made manifest by
        Eph. 5:11-13    the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light."

                            "Unfruitful works of darkness." Paul exhorts believers to
                         "cast off" these works, because "the night is far spent, the day
                         is at hand." Rom. 13:12. The time is late, the evil works are
                         fruitless—this is convincing exhortation. "The end of those
                         things is death." Rom. 6:21. The psalmist says: "Depart from
                         me, ye evildoers." Ps. 119:115.
                            Does it take courage to reprove evil, either by word or
                         example? Reproof brings the work of darkness out into the
                         light, but the reproof is both difficult and often resented. Prov.
                         15:12. Note what Jesus said about reproof. John 3:20, 21.
                         Some do not think of the evil of their ways until reproved;
                         thus reproof brings light to them.
                            "Reproved. . . . The hidden and dark things in a person's
                         life are exposed under the bright beams of spiritual light. When
                         Christ turned the light of truth on the hypocrisy of His day,
                         the sham was seen for what it really was. When deeds done
                         in the dark are viewed in the dark, their outlines are obscured,
                         their true character unrevealed."—SDA Bible Commentary, on
                         Eph. 5:13.
                            What exhortation does Paul give with regard to the
                         believer and the former vices? Name the new attitude
                         to be taken to these works of darkness. Eph. 5:11; Rom.
                         13:12. How does throwing light on an evil practice af-

                         to someone or something needing reproof?

       OPPORTUNITY
           Eph. 5:14        "Wake up, 0 sleeper" (Moffatt) is a peremptory command
                         to (a) some in the church who are not truly in Christ, (b) the
                         sinner who has not yet found Him.
                            He has a new challenge. We are to wake up, be in earnest,
                         living in the light of Christ's teachings. Christ gives light and
                         life (John 1:4), and He is the Light. John 1:9.
                            "Give thee light. . . The soul that turns to Christ is assured
                         of the healing rays of light that come from the 'Sun of Righ,
                         teousness' (Mal. 4:2). The plea is for the impenitent to arouse
                         from their lethargy, and thus to give Christ an opportunity to
                         do His saving work in their souls."—SDA Bible Commentary,
                         on Eph. 5:14.
                            To be awake is to progress in spiritual life. To be asleep is
                         to backslide.
                            "God designs that Christians shall grow continually, grow
                         up unto the full stature of men and women in Christ. All who

                           How does the apostle appeal to the Ephesian believers
                         about their spiritual condition? Eph. 5:14. What does it
                         mean to be spiritually asleep? 1 Cor. 15:34.




                           What is promised to those who awake? What is the
                         nature of the "light" that Christ will give? Acts 26:23.

      INVOLVEMENT
        Eph. 5:15, 16  Circumspectly. Christians in all ages must live carefully,
                       strictly, according to principle. Christians working and living
                       among pagans could accommodate easily to the language, habits,
                       and pastimes of their neighbors. Is it true in our present un-

                       from idleness or frivolous activities. A person is not good
                       merely because he is not bad. Like Jesus, one must be 'about'

           KNOWING the will of the Lord is."
          GOD'S WILL
            Eph. 5:17 The Christian's highest wisdom is knowing and doing the
                         will of God, by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. Fidelity to
                         His Father's will controlled every thought and action of Jesus.
                         John 5:30. He came to earth, not to do His own will, but to
                         do His Father's will. John 6:38. The will of God is for our
                         eternal life. John 6:40. God's will is not arbitrary and capri-
                         cious, but righteous, full of truth and mercy. His will is perfect.
                         Rom. 12:2.
                            "Will of the Lord. To know the will of the Lord should be

                                                                               June 2
              Part 4      "And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but
       INFILLING OF    be filled with the Spirit."
          THE SPIRIT
           Eph. 5:18
                          Drunk with wine. This is a prohibition in specific terms.
                       Drunkenness is a sinful inconsistency for Christians. It is a
                       reckless waste of money and life. The prodigal son gave way
                       to "riotous living" (Luke 15:13), or living dissolutely. Paul
                       stipulated that church leaders should be "not given to wine."
                       Titus 1:7. He included women in this prohibition in Titus 2:3.
                       By antithesis Paul exhorts believers to be filled with the Spirit
                       of God. Two extremes are here set forth. How did some spec-
                       tators at Pentecost confuse the two? Acts 2:13. Does being
                       "filled with the Spirit" always involve ecstatic displays of a
                       Pentecostal nature? How would you relate a Spirit-filled life
                       with visible enthusiasm?
                          "The seeking after an earthly stimulant is replaced by the
                       spiritual enthusiasm of the human spirit energized by the Holy
                       Spirit. Although it is true that soberness accompanies the work
                       of the Holy Spirit, nevertheless, the effect of the presence of
                       the Holy Spirit is seen in enthusiastic witnessing for the faith.
                       On the Day of Pentecost the demonstration of the Spirit in the
                       words and acts of the disciples was scoffingly compared to
                       drunkenness (Acts 2:13) ."—SDA Bible Commentary, on Eph.
                       5:18.
                           "Only to those who wait humbly upon God, who watch for
                       His guidance and grace, is the Spirit given. The power of God
                       awaits their demand and reception. This promised blessing,
                        claimed by faith, brings all other blessings in its train. It is
                        given according to the riches of the grace of Christ, and He is
                        ready to supply every soul according to the capacity to receive."

                           What vice does the apostle single out for condemna-
                        tion? What is his exhortation regarding the Spirit of
                        God? How may this exhortation be carried out? John 4:34.

                        a satisfactory Christian experience, could it be that the
                        difficulty might lie in that they are "halfhearted" instead

              Part 5        "Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and
          SPIRITUAL     spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart
        EXPRESSION      to the Lord; giving thanks always for all things unto God
       Eph. 5:19, 20    and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ."

                            Across the centuries, singing has been a far-reaching power
                        in the world. It has been a great factor in the life of the Chris-
                        tian church and in the experience of the believer. The apostle
                        exhorts the Ephesians to strengthen their experience by song
                        and by expression of thanks. Spiritual strength results from
                        spiritual song. Col. 3:16. Daniel made his prayers with thanks.
                        Dan. 6:10. There is singing that is vocal, and there is singing
                        in the soul that is silent but joyful. Both express praise to God.
                        Paul is noted for his spirit of unceasing thanksgiving. 1 Thess.
                        2:13; 2 Tim. 1:3.
                            "Giving thanks. 'Nothing tends more to promote health of
                        body and of soul than does a spirit of gratitude and praise'
                         (MH 251). The spirit of praise is an antidote to evil and dis-
                        couragement. When everything else is at its worst, the Chris-
                        tian is at his best and is most cheerful. The spirit of thankful-
                        ness prevails in joy or in sorrow, in victory or in defeat, for it
                        is a permanent, sustaining attribute of Christian character.. . .
                            "In the name of. God is the recipient of thanksgiving, but
                        it is offered in the name of Jesus Christ. The Father is entitled
                        to gratitude because He is our Father (Rom. 8:14-17; Gal.
                        4:4-6). He has demonstrated His Fatherhood in the giving of
                        His Son; therefore prayer and thanksgiving are offered in the
                        Son's name. Since through Christ all that the Father has to
                        give has been made available to men, we can approach our
                        God with the utmost confidence (John 14:13; 15:16; 16:23,
                         24)."—SDA Bible Commentary, on Eph. 5:20.
                           Through what spiritual exercise were the believers to
                        give expression to their faith and their experience? Dis-
                        cuss the relationship of sobriety, excitement, and joyful-
                        ness as set forth in this lesson. Should a Christian's thanks
                        be spasmodic or constant?

         Eph._5:11 the Messiah, the Anointed One."—Amplified.

                            Submission, or humility, is a characteristic of New Testa-
                         ment teaching. In Rom. 13:1-7 we find submission to "the
                         higher powers"; in '1 Peter 2:13 it is "to every ordinance of
                         man for the Lord's sake"; in 1 Peter 2:18 to 3:7 it covers a
                         wide area from employers and owners to all domestic life. It
                         was the Christian approach to lawful and orderly life and was
                         based upon a deep respect and fear of God as seen in Eph. 5:21.
                            To fulfill his mission properly, every Christian must have
                         humility. One has tersely said: "Mutual subjection is part of
                         a wise, circumspect walk, i.e. mutual recognition of each other's
                         rights and of our obligations to serve them. Humility is not
                         cowardice or servility. It is a recognition first of the sovereignty
                         of God, and second of the Christian equality of man."—Selected.
                            "Submission, humility, and subjection are essential charac-
                         teristics of the believer. Before God and one's fellowmen, self
                         is to be brought low. Often the demands we make of one an-
                         other, even of our rights, are contrary to the spirit of loving
                         ministry, which is the spirit of the gospel (John 13:15, 16;
                         Gal. 5:15). In addition to submission to superiors in age and
                         authority, and respect for those we consider equals, there is
                         also a Christian submission due to those who may be con-
                        -sidered inferior in position. This submission reveals itself in
                         consideration, charity, and respect for the personality of all
                         God's children."—SDA Bible Commentary, on Eph. 5:21.
                             "Only when selfishness is dead, when strife for supremacy is
                         banished, when gratitude fills the heart, and love makes fragrant
                         the life—it is only then that Christ is abiding in the soul, and

      Eph. 5:22, 23 Saviour of the body."

                             The context of Christian submission is set by the general
                          instruction: "All of you be subject one to another." 1 Peter 5:5.
                          Paul finds it necessary to give some instruction on humility
                          among married believers. The new spiritual condition of the
                          Ephesians, like other aspects of their life, was in need of some
                          religious orientation. The status of women and children in
                          those times was degraded. Thus Paul gave strong and repeated
                          emphases on the real meaning of submission, based on the
                          relation between Christ and the church.
                             "The headship of the husband consists in his ability and re-
                          sponsibility to care for his wife, in the same way that Christ
                          cares for the church.

                              Did submission of member to member in the Christian

                          was it degrading? In what manner were the wives to be

                        authority is unrestricted. He is to direct and care for his wife
                        and family in love, not with dominating, dictatorial power. He
                        is not like Christ in power and wisdom, but he is to practice
                        Christ's loving care.
                            The husband's authority must not oppose the wife's fidelity
                        to her God.
                            "A true husband never utters rude commands. His love will

                            The same quotation from Gen. 2:24 is found in Matt. 19:5 ;
                         Mark 10:7, 8. Here is the basis of the beneficial institution of
                         marriage, from which come the home, the family, and society.
                            "A great mystery. . . . Paul is saying that the revealed mys-
                         tery of the union of husband and wife is indeed a great and

                         and His church. While human marriage can be understood, the
                         mystic union of Christ and believer, though a revealed truth,
                         is still beyond our complete apprehension; we still 'see through
                         a glass, darkly' (1 Cor. 13:12)."—SDA Bible Commentary, on
                         Eph. 5:31, 32.
                           How close is the union of husband and wife said to
                         be? Eph. 5:31. In what sense can the husband be "the
                         head of the wife" (Eph. 5:23) and yet have unity and

To the Pillars of the Christian Home          LESSON 11                     ❑ Friday
                                                                               June 11
             Part 6     "Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so
      FINAL APPEAL love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she
          Eph. 5:33 reverence her husband."

                           The primary emphasis in the whole of Paul's comments in
                        Ephesians 5 is on Christ's redeeming love for the church. If be-
                        lievers really understood the depth of that love, there would be
                        fewer marital problems today. Can a husband love Christ su-
                        premely and be unkind to his wife and children? Can a wife
                        understand Christ's love and fail in wifely loyalties in her home?
                           Both man and woman were created by and for God, and in
                        Christ they are still His own. Col. 1:16, 17. In marriage they
                        should act toward each other as Christ's redeemed children.
                           "Reverence. . . . Paul does not mean cringing fear; that
                        would be out of keeping with the counsel he has been giving.
                        This honor and respect that is urged in no way eliminates love
                        on the part of the wife. It means that God's natural order in
                        the family should not be subverted, and that the special func-
                        tion of leadership that God has laid upon the husband should
                        be regarded. . . . Where there is mutual love and respect, ques-
                        tions of domination or alienation will not arise."—SDA Bible
                        Commentary, on Eph. 5:33.
                           The home of Amram and Jochebed is an example of the
                        influence of the home on the life of a great man—Moses. "She
                        [Jochebed] faithfully improved her opportunity to educate her
                        child for God. . . . The whole future life of Moses, the great
                        mission which he fulfilled . . . , testifies to the importance of
                        the work of the Christian mother. There is no other work that
                        can equal this."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pages 243, 244.
                           How much should a husband love his wife? Should we
                        expect this to be reciprocated by the wife? Eph. 5:25, 33.


                            To what extent do you think right parental attitudes
                         affect the home?



 THINK IT THROUGH           Is there any guarantee that a Christian home always
                         produces good children, or a bad home bad children?

          Eph. 6:1, 2
                           One of the main principles of the theocracy of Israel was
                        the education of 'the children in the religion of the living God.
                        The underlying concept of that education was obedience to
                        God and to parents. One of the Ten Commandments is specific.
                        Ex. 20:12.
                           Parents in Israel were required to teach their children "dili-
                        gently" the "commandments, the statutes, and the judgments."
                        See Deut. 6:1, 7.
                           "The obligation resting upon children to honor their par-

                        the affection and attention of the children should be bestowed
                        in proportion to the need of father and mother. . . .
                           "Our obligation to our parents never ceases. Our love for
                        them, and theirs for us, is not measured by years or distance,
                        and our responsibility can never be set aside."—The Adventist

                        nacle, Samuel had even then duties to perform in the service

                        into every duty of life. He regarded himself as God's servant,

           Eph. 6:3          Obedience to God's commandments brings rich blessings. God
                        promised blessings to Israel if they would diligently observe
                        His commandments. Deut. 28:1-14.

                             "It is well recognized that a wholesome family life, of which
                        obedience is a part, tends to the well-being of society and of
                        nations. Obedience to Christian parents means sobriety, indus-

                         their parents is to violate God's law? Do they realize

         TO FATHERS but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the
     ABOUT CHILDREN Lord."
            Eph. 6:4
                            Parents are reminded of two duties to their children, one a
                        negative and the other a positive. Training children is a task
                        that is neither easily nor rapidly done. Parents must remember
                        that patience is a great part of teaching. Vexatious commands,
                        incessant teasing, hasty blame and reproof, displays of temper
                        —these are all provocation to children. Rather, show children
                        and young people appreciation and encouragement for the things
                        they have done right.
                            Parents should remember that example carries far greater
                        weight with children and young people than does advice. Par-
                        ents' counsel should agree with their own way of life.
                            "Provoke not. . . . The parallel passage in Colossians gives
                        the reason for this admonition . . . (Col. 3:21). The present

                            "Parents should be much at home. By precept and example
                        they should teach their children the love and the fear of God;
                        teach them to be intelligent, social, affectionate; to cultivate
                        habits of industry, economy, and self-denial. By giving their
                        children love, sympathy, and encouragement at home, parents
                        may provide for them a safe and welcome retreat from many

                                                                             June 16

       FOR SLAVES ness of your heart, as unto Christ; not with eyeservice, as
                     menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will
                     of God from the heart; with goodwill doing service, as
         Eph. 6:5-7 to the Lord, and not to men."

                         Paul's teaching of the gospel was not to start a revolution
                      against the evil of slavery, but an evolution in moral thinking
                      was begun which eventually broke the chains of human bond-
                      age. Christian concepts—that "God is no respecter of persons,"
                      and that "all nations of men" were made of one blood (Acts
                      10:34; 17:27)—were incompatible with belief in slavery. As
                      masters and slaves worshiped the same God (Eph. 4:6), in the
                      same church, and recognized Jesus as their Lord (verse 5), all
                      must have been convinced of the incongruity of the situation
                      socially and spiritually.
                         The reference to diligence in endeavor, the spirit of the
                      worker, and instruction to the masters, is relevant and useful
                      to both employees and employers of our times.
                         "The sense of Christ's Lordship ensures honesty in work. So
                      the apostle continues: 'Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers.'
                      . . . It is the common fault and temptation of servants in all
                      degrees to observe the master's eye, and to work busily or
                      slackly as they are watched or not. Such workmen act as they
                      do because they look to men and not to God. Their work is
                      without conscience and self-respect. The visible master says
                      `Well done !' But there is another Master looking on who says
                      `Ill done!' . . . In His book of accounts there is a stern reckon-
                      ing in store for deceitful dealers and the makers-up of unsound
                      goods, in whatever handicraft or headcraft they are engaged."
                      —G. G. Findlay, Epistle to the Ephesians, pages 390, 391.
                          What three qualities were to characterize the obedi-
                      ence of servants? What is meant by "eyeservice, as men-
                      pleasers"? See Matt. 23:5. Does this counsel apply only
                      to slaves in Roman times, or to all men in all ages? What
                      is the predominating feature that should characterize our
                      Christian service? ("To the Lord," Eph. 6:7. Compare Eph.
                      5:22.)


 THINK IT THROUGH        Would there be some revolution in social relationships
                      today if all Christians would practice fully the gospel
                      principles in our text? Would it open doors to new hearts
                      for the message of a soon-coming Saviour? What effect
                      would come to employee-employer relations?

Excellence in Endeavor    LESSON 12                                   ❑ Thursday
                                                                             June 17

       REWARD OF     the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond
      THE WORKER     or free."
          Eph. 6:8
                        The apostle now mentions the judgment, putting all men
                     on the same level. See 2 Cor. 5:10. In the Roman world there
                     were sharp differences in social status, but in the body of Christ
                     this was not to be so. 1 Cor. 12:13; Gal. 3:27, 28; Col. 3:11. A
                     common human aspiration has been reward for service, but the
                     world often bestows on drudgery little or no reward. Now
                     Paul assures the slave of reward for the good deeds, if not in
                     this world, in the next. To rob service wholly of reward lowers
                     work into the desperation of forced drudgery. Although rewards
                     are not really earned, yet God pictures at least some of His
                     gifts as rewards. Rev. 22:12. This fact must have brought great
                     joy to the slave.
                        "Knowing. The slave may have the assurance that his life
                     and deeds are observed by Providence, and that the rewards
                     that come to other men will be his also. The great spiritual cer-
                     tainties are the heritage of all believers."—SDA Bible Commen-
                     tary, on Eph. 6:8.
                        The slave, as a member of the church, gets knowledge and
                     understanding of life never before available to him. This knowl-
                     edge will lead him to faith (Rom. 10:17), and faith to victory.
                        "Let a living faith run like threads of gold through the per-
                     formance of even the smallest duties. Then all the daily work
                     will promote Christian growth. There will be a continual look-
                     ing unto Jesus. Love for Him will give vital force to every-
                     thing that is undertaken. Thus through the right use of our
                     talents, we may link ourselves by a golden chain to the higher
                     world."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 360.
                        "But when the Master receives the talents, He approves and
                     rewards the workers as though the merit were all their own.
                     His countenance is full of joy and satisfaction. . . . For every
                     service and every sacrifice He requites them, not because it is
                     a debt He owes, but because His heart is overflowing with love
                     and tenderness."—Ibid., p. 361.
                        What great truth is now announced to the slave? On
                     what new level of society did this status place him? In
                     what sense are "bond" and "free" on the same level?
                     See Acts 17:26.




 THINK IT THROUGH       Besides the rewards and benefits from endeavor men-
                     tioned in the notes and texts of this lesson, what others
                     have you experienced? Is there a connection between
                     one's daily work and his religion?

                                                                             June 18
           Part 6     "And, ye masters, do the same things unto them,
      INSTRUCTION forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also
       TO MASTERS is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with
          Eph. 6:9 Him."

                           In the Christian community human rights vitally concern
                       the relationships between members and groups. The high and
                       low, the rich and poor, are all brothers in Chiist. Even in
                       servant-and-master relationships in Roman days the spirit of
                       brotherhood was enjoined on all. The golden rule (Matt. 7:12)
                       is to be put into practice. Every action is to take into account
                       that both master and slave have the same Lord in heaven. At
                       the bar of judgment He will ask both "What was done?" and
                       "Who did it?" Then both good and bad deeds will meet their
                       reward regardless of the status of the persons concerned. This
                       kind of thinking and practice among masters and slaves put
                       things entirely in a new light, and the prevailing social systems
                       began to change.
                           "Forbearing threatening. Special instruction had been given
                       the Hebrews on the treatment of servants (Lev. 25:39-43; Deut.
                       15:12-14; Jer. 34:14), and even more was expected of Chris-
                       tians, who had a fuller revelation of God in Christ Jesus as
                       regards human relationships. Threatening implies fear and
                       force, whereas the way of the gospel is the way of love. Threat-
                       ening is usually the beginning of cruelty and must be entirely
                       eliminated. It is a tremendous challenge to any administrator
                        to exercise his authority in love rather than through power and
                        force. It does not mean that he should not expect just service,
                       but his warnings and discipline must be exercised with self-
                        control and Christian charity. ReTect for the personalities of

                        mind as they dealt with the slaves? Col. 4:1.




 THINK IT THROUGH          Was it easy for Roman slave owners to practice these
                        Christian principles? Did slaves and masters need divine

         BE STRONG      the power of His might. Put on the whole armor of God,
       IN HIS MIGHT     that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the
        Eph. 6:10, 11   devil."

                           Victory goes to the strong. Spiritual survival is a question
                        of strong faith in Christ. The believers will be strong only in
                        the might of God. Phil. 4:13. Paul always has confidence in the
                        power of God (Rom. 1:16; 2 Cor. 6:4, 7), and thus he exhorts,
                        "Be strong in the Lord." While believing in the power of God
                        to save, the Christian must ever remember that there is an
                        enemy to watch. 1 Peter 5:8. God always has a means for the
                        salvation of the just, and it is the armor of God.
                           Ways by which the Christian can be strong in the Lord:
                           "I saw that the strength of the children of God is in their
                        humility. When they are little in their own eyes, Jesus will be
                        to them their strength and their righteousness, and God will
                        prosper their labors."—Testimonies, Vol. 3, p. 307.
                           "God has strength and wisdom in store for those who seek
                        for it earnestly, in faith believing."—Ibid., p. 108.
                           "Faith in Christ's power will impart strength to sustain,
                        and light to guide."—Ibid., Vol. 5, p. 42.
                           "Remember that prayer is the source of your strength."—
                        Ibid., Vol. 7, p. 2437
                           "None but those who have fortified the mind with the truths
                        of the Bible will stand through the last great conflict."—The
                        Great Controversy, pages 593, 594.
                           "If the Word of God were appreciated as it should be, both
                        young and old would possess an inward rectitude, a strength
                        of principle, that would enable them to resist temptation."—
                        Testimonies, Vol. 8, p. 319.
                           Repeat the two exhortations given by the apostle. How
                        does the believer become "strong in the Lord"? 2 Tim.

       THE POWERS       of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness
      OF DARKNESS       in high places."
          Eph. 6:12
                           With his keen spiritual perception, the apostle saw troublous
                        times coming, not only for the individual but also for the
                        church. There is a fight to be carried on by the believer. 2 Tim.
                        4:7. There is constant enmity against the church. Rev. 12:17.
                        The enemy stalks as prey those who fear God. 1 Peter 5:8.
                        "Resist" is the watchword for the believer. 1 Peter 5:9.
                           "In the Word of God are represented two contending parties
                        that influence and control human agencies in our world. Con-
                        stantly these parties are working with every human being. Those
                        who are under God's control and who are influenced by the
                        heavenly angels, will be able to discern the crafty workings of
                        the unseen powers of darkness. . . . They must give no place
                        whatever to Satan and his angels.

                        concerning us has been revealed to all, yet a knowledge of His
                        will does not set aside the necessity of offering earnest suppli-
                        cations to Him for help, and of diligently seeking to cooperate
                        with Him in answering the prayers offered."—Ellen G. White

            Part 3         "Wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God,
 THE WHOLE ARMOR        that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and
         Eph. 6:13      having done all, to stand."

                           In the evil day. Does this imply a specific future day? In
                        Eph. 5:16 Paul says, "because the days are evil." So his genera-
                        tion was evil. This was the thought of Jesus: "This is your
                        hour, and the power of darkness." In our world every day is
                        an evil day in the sense that the Satanic hosts are always active.
                           The whole armor. God's armor must not be worn in part.
                        David had less than a full armor when he fell into sin. See
                        2 Samuel 11; 12. Jacob had only partial armor when he deceived
                        Isaac his father. Genesis 27. Peter was not fully armored when
                        he denied his Lord. Matt. 26:69-75.
                           The Christian is vulnerable at many spots, and often that
                        characteristic he thinks is his strongest turns out, under tempta-
                        tion, to be his weakest. As a chain is no stronger than its weak-
                        est link, so the Christian is no stronger than his weakest ele-
                        ment of character. In view of the variety of foes that must be
                        met and the various weaknesses of the flesh, nothing less than
                        the entire armor will suffice.
                           "Having done all. . . . Trusting in God never deprives one
                        of the privilege of exerting his own God-given powers to the
                        utmost. Although it is true that the battle will never be won
                        without God's armor and power, neither will it be won without
                        the cooperation of the human with the divine." [See Thoughts
                        From the Mount of Blessing, page 142.]
                           "It is the armor of God, because the possession of it is the
                        direct result of the presence of God within. Where the Spirit
                        of God inhabits our nature, His presence ensures our possession
                        of this armor of proof.
                           "It is the armor of God because Jesus Christ, the God-man,
                        was clothed in it, and in it defeated the foe. At any rate, we
                        may learn what this armor is, and how best to use it, by study-
                        ing the use Christ made of it."—Speaker's Bible, edited by
                        James Hastings, on Eph. 6:13, pages 403, 404.
                           What danger is involved if the believer is clothed in
                        only a part of the, armor? What do the following mean
                        to you: "withstand," "evil day," and "having done all, to
                        stand"? See Luke 1:17, last part; 1 Tim. 6:12.


 THINK IT THROUGH           How long will the Christian be involved in the war-
                        fare? How only will the warfare be carried on success-
                        fully?


  "God's servants are to put on every       and help of Heaven. ... Never are we

not wrestling simply with human foes.       warfare there is no release. . . . Those

                         personal loyalty to principle. Both are essential for successful

                            "Gospel of peace. . . In this verse . . . the idea seems to be
                         that of steadfastness in the Christian warfare. Hence the gospel,
                         in this instance, is not so much the gospel to be proclaimed, but

                            All of these figures used to define the Christian's armor are
                         drawn from Roman soldiers' equipment, probably in the order
                         in which the warrior put them on. In another place it is "the
                         armor of light"; it all means to "put on the Lord Jesus Christ"
                         and to live as He lived.
                            Does the warrior language of our lesson teach salva-
                         tion by works? Does a peaceful Christian nevertheless
                         have to fight evil? See James 4:7.

                Part 5      "Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye
      SHIELD, HELMET,    shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.
               SWORD     And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the
         Eph. 6:16, 17   Spirit, which is the Word of God."

                            The Roman shield protected the whole body against the
                         enemy's arrows, sometimes heated or alight. Compare Ps. 120:4.
                            "Faith. . . . This faith is active, like the shield that is raised
                         to catch the fiery darts; it is also passive in that it trusts in
                         God for deliverance. Under the impact of temptation of any
                         kind it is faith that restores confidence and enables one to
                         carry on the battle. . . .
                            "Fiery darts. Ancient arrows sometimes had combustible ma-
                         terials, such as tow and pitch, ignited on the head of the shaft
                         so as to set fire to whatever they hit. This is an appropriate
                         image for the fiery temptations that come to the child of God.
                         They may take the form of fear, discouragement, impatience,
                         unholy thoughts, envy, anger, or any other vice. But faith in
                         God, held aloft like a shield, catches them, snuffs out the flame,
                         and makes them fall harmless to the ground."—SDA Bible
                         Commentary, on Eph. 6:16.
                            "Paul knew that the higher Christian attainments can be
                         reached only through much prayer and constant watchfulness,
                         and this he tried to instill into their minds. But he knew also
                         that in Christ crucified they were offered power sufficient to
                         convert the soul and divinely adapted to enable them to resist
                         all temptations to evil."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 307.
                            Name and describe the three weapons of Christian
                         victory mentioned in the lesson. Quote some New Testa-

                         power of God through faith." 1 Peter 1:5.




 THINK IT THROUGH           Why do you think Paul mentions only one weapon of
                         attack (the sword) among numerous pieces of defensive
                         armor? Is this to encourage Christians to adopt a stand
                         for truth, and, when the attacks of the enemy are over, to
                         be found still standing for God and truth?

             Part 6     "Praying always with all prayer and supplication in
          VICTORY the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance
         THROUGH and supplication for all saints; and for me, that utterance
           PRAYER may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly,
                     to make known the mystery of the gospel, for which I am
                     an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly,
                     as I ought to speak. But that ye also may know my affairs,
                     and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful
                     minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:
                     whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that
                     ye might know our affairs, and that he might comfort
                     your hearts. Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith,
                     from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Grace be
                     with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity.
        Eph. 6:18-24 Amen."

                          "Praying always" is linked with "all perseverance" and
                       means effort or exertion in prayer. This is the case in all areas
                       of spiritual life.
                          "For all saints" is all-inclusive. We should pray for those
                       we naturally like and those we may not like.
                          "And for me" indicates Paul's conscious need for both words
                       and courage. "Utterance" means not only words but wisdom
                       in choosing and using them. Compare 1 Cor. 12:8, where Paul
                       states that the Spirit gives "the word of wisdom."
                          "Prayer is not another weapon; rather, it is the spirit, the
                       manner, in which the whole armor is to be worn and the battle
                       fought. Paul is here urging it as a perpetual state of mind, a
                       continuous attitude of communion with God (see Luke 18:1;
                       Phil. 4:6; Heb. 4:16). . . .
                          "Perseverance in prayer is not for the purpose, by sheer
                       persistence, of making God change His mind, in some such
                       fashion as a begging child finally extracts what he wants from
                       an unwilling parent. Perseverance in prayer, however, clearly
                       indicates on the part of the suppliant a state of mind that
                       gives God an opportunity to do things He could not safely do
                       for him otherwise."—SDA Bible Commentary, on Eph. 6:18.
                           Is it natural and easy to pray unceasingly, or do we
                        need the Holy Spirit's help in this?




  THINK IT THROUGH         What are the main characteristics of acceptable
                        prayer? See Matt. 7:7; James 1:6; Phil. 4:6; Col. 4:2.

            Thirteenth Sabbath Offering
               THE NEW AFRO-MIDEAST DIVISION

                     A Realignment of Nations

   The Afro-Mideast Division, recipient of the offering overflow
of the second quarter, 1971, was formed at the time of the General
Conference Session held in Atlantic City in June, 1970. It includes
the territory of the former Middle East Division, the Ethiopian
Union, the East Africa Union, and the Tanzania Union. One hun-
dred thirteen thousand church members live in this territory.
   The offering overflow will be divided between two educational
institutions which serve as training centers for the future workers
and leaders of this vast territory. The Bugema Missionary College
in Uganda, East Africa, is in desperate need of building and equip-
ment if it is to continue to serve the increasing demands of this
region.
    Middle East College in Beirut, Lebanon, while offering a strong
educational program, must increase its facilities as it seeks to serve
the greatly increased constituency of the new division.
    These projects are worthy of the sacrifice of each Sabbath School
member. As you give, remember that you will be helping to prepare
those who will finish the work of God in this vast territory.
                                           Ray Jacobs, Secretary,
                                           Afro-Mideast Division.
