         The Blessing of Daily Study
    "Every day some portion of time should be appropri-
ated to the study of the lessons, not merely in learning to
mechanically repeat the words, while the mind does not
comprehend the meaning; but to go to the very founda-
tion, and become familiar with what is brought out in the
lesson."—Counsels on Sabbath School Work, page 53.




                     My Pledge
   As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge
of the Scriptures, I pledge myself to the careful and
prayerful study of some portion of my Sabbath School

       Christian Social Behavior
                       FIRST QUARTER, 1971

    Christians cannot behave in a socially acceptable way without a knowledge
of certain principles, a moral code. Christians have a moral code in the Ten
Commandments (based on love to God and love to our fellowmen), amplified
in the admonitions given by God in the Bible, and made plainer in the gift
of prophecy writings of our day.
    "Ethics" are the standards, principles, or laws of conduct that govern the
actions of men, or are man's interpretation of a moral code. A man's interpre-
tation is affected by such things as his environment, experience, and cultural
background. This is why we are not given permission to judge our brethren.
This is not our work. Our work is to tell others what Jesus has done for us
and to point out a better way of life.
    Christianity is governed by moral principles. Early in Biblical history (Lev.
19:18) this ideal was revealed: "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."
Much of the chapter applies it to specific situations. Jesus stated it briefly:
"Treat other people exactly as you would like to be treated by them—this is
the essence of all true religion." Matt. 7:12, Phillips. Paul revealed some of
the ideals of Christianity in his letter to the Galatians. Gal. 5:22, 23. Peter
gave us another list. 2 Peter 1: 3-8. "The fruit of the Spirit," Paul called them.
"Against such there is no law." Notice that in both lists many of the items
apply to our relations with our fellowmen.
    Commenting on Gal. 5:22, 23, Ellen White said: "The influence of the
Holy Spirit is the life of Christ in the soul. We do not see Christ and speak
to Him, but His Holy Spirit is just as near us in one place as in another. It
works in and through everyone who receives Christ. Those who know the
indwelling of the Spirit reveal the fruits of the Spirit—love, joy, peace, long-
suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA
Bible Commentary, Vol. 6, p. 1112.
    This quarter it will be our privilege to concentrate on God's desire for
proper Christian social behavior. May it be our experience to witness the ful-
fillment of this promise in our lives. "As you receive the Spirit of Christ—the
Spirit of unselfish love and labor for others—you will grow and bring forth
fruit. The graces of the Spirit will ripen in your character."—Christ's Object
Lessons, page 68.

      THE GODHEAD: THE IDEAL RELATIONSHIP 1

trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation."

         John 17:5, 22   them; that they may be one, even as We are one."

                            How can we mortals comprehend such a relationship except
                         as we recall the ideals of 1 Corinthians 13? A momentary sep-
                         aration in an eternal fellowship is described in John 17. Two
                         Beings commune together. Eternal Partners reviewing Their
                         work in the execution of a plan to help the "neighbor" in
                         need.
                            The greatest neighbor anywhere is the one who cares enough
                         to get involved with us and our needs. If there is anything
                         greater than loving, it is the willingness and the ability to love.
                         Only the members of the Godhead individually have the love,
                         willingness, and capacity to meet all needs.
                            Among themselves Their merciful love is revealed in Their
                         willingness to share all that They possess. They share Their
                         joys, and perhaps most significantly, They share in Their
                         creative work.
                            To us Their relationship is revealed in Their willingness to
                         do anything, without thought of the cost to Themselves, in
                         order to win mankind to the side of right. Phil. 2:5-8; Rom.
                         5:6-11; John 3:16, 17; 1 John 4:9-11.
                            In what relationship was Christ with His Father before
                         He came to our world? John 17:22.

                         equality of the three Members of the Godhead, com-

       Ps. 145:17-20    love Him: but all the wicked will He destroy."

                           "So long as all created beings acknowledged the allegiance
                        of love, there was perfect harmony throughout the universe
                        of God. . . And while love to God was supreme, love for
                        one another was confiding and unselfish.. .
                           "Now the perfect harmony of heaven was broken. Lucifer's
                        disposition to serve himself instead of his Creator aroused a
                        feeling of apprehension when observed by those who considered
                        that the glory of God should be supreme."—Patriarchs and
                        Prophets, pages 35, 36.
                           "He [Lucifer] saw that 'the Lord is righteous in all His ways,
                        and holy in all His works.' "—Ibid., p. 39.
                           In spite of an immediate problem that would bring a blot
                        on the fair universe and would cause long centuries of pain
                        and woe to this planet, the Godhead acted with justice and
                        mercy in seeking to redeem Lucifer from his waywardness. As
                        a parent tries patiently to win back an erring child, so God
                        worked long and patiently to help Lucifer regain his place.
                        See Patriarchs and Prophets, page 39.
                           Even when Lucifer chose not to respond to the appeals of
                        God, he was not destroyed in a sudden fit of rage; rather, his
                        life was preserved in order that time could be allowed for all
                        of God's creatures to witness the difference between good and
                        evil. See Patriarchs and Prophets, pages 42, 43.
                            What attitude does God take toward those who re-

 THINK IT THROUGH           Do you think that God dealt fairly with the human
                         family when He allowed Lucifer to live? Are we not the
                         subjects of an "experiment"? See "The Desire of Ages,"

           FOR MAN one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth,

                      is there of you, whom if hit son ask bread, will he give
                      him a stone? Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a ser-
                      pent? If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts
                      unto your children, how much more shall your Father
                      which is in heaven give good things to them that ask
         Matt. 7:7-11 Him?"

                           The Godhead, in dealing with mankind, sought the most
                        direct method in reaching the minds of men. The Godhead is
                        not sparing with the gifts of heaven; the Godhead does not
                        deal with men the way men deal with each other (Matt.
                        7:1-6), but is gracious and merciful. See SDA Bible Com-
                        mentary, on Matt. 7:7. No fathers in Christ's audience would
                        be so cruel or heartless as to offer their children worthless gifts
                        in response to the children's request for food. How impossible,
                        then, is it to believe that the Godhead will disappoint man in
                        any way.
                           We need not have any hesitation in coming to the Godhead
                        —the Giver of "every good gift and every perfect gift." James
                        1:17. Promises have been extended to us by the Godhead as
                        "security" in order that we mortals might realize heaven's gifts.
                        See Education, page 253. Let it always be remembered that the
                        Godhead is seeking to save, not to condemn mankind. John
                        3:16, 17; 2 Cor. 5:17-21. The Godhead has offered every pos-
                        sible gift to save—including life itself. Rom. 5:6-11.
                           What are the conditions for answered prayer? Matt.
                        7:7, 8.




    THINK IT THROUGH       What evidence has God given in order that I might
                        make an intelligent decision concerning the kind of Per-
                        son that He is?

                    and gave the lad drink. And God was with the lad; and
                    he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an

                         Although the Old Testament is largely historical, it has a
                      wealth of material on relationships. In the book of Genesis
                      alone there are many instances. See, for example, Gen. 3:7-10;
                      4:9-15; 5:21-24; 6:9; 12:1-4; 22:1-14; 32:24-29. Among these
                      stories is that of Hagar, the bondwoman whom Abraham mar-
                      ried and was forced to reject.
                         Because Abraham and Sarah distrusted the promise of God,
                      another woman was allowed to become Abraham's wife. She
                      bore a son. But when God fulfilled the promise made to Abra-
                      ham years before, the envy and strife became insupportable.
                      See SDA Bible Dictionary, "Ishmael." Hagar and Ishmael found
                      themselves in the dry desert, rejected and with little hope for
                      continued life. But the God of the universe was not so busy
                      that He neglected to hear the faint cry of a dying boy and
                      a deserted and lonely mpther. See SDA Bible Commentary, on
                      Gen. 21:17.
                         It should also be remembered that God was not partial to
                      Isaac. He carefully revealed purposes and plans for both boys.
                      Gen. 21:12, 13, 18; Rom. 9:7. Although Isaac was to be heir
                      to God's royal line by birth, God did not hesitate to reveal a
                       promise concerning Ishmael. "I will make him a great nation."
                      See SDA Bible Dictionary, "Ishmaelites." This is the way the
                      Godhead relates to human need both in times of joy and in
                      times of sorrow.
                         For what reasons were Hagar and her son found in
                      the desert? Gen. 21:9-11.




  THINK IT THROUGH       What is God's attitude toward individuals innocently
                      caught in circumstances in which His commands have
                      been violated?

       John 8:10, 11     condemn thee: go, and sin no more."

                            This is a splendid illustration of the ideal relationship that
                         can exist between man and his fellows. We ourselves need to
                         turn away from sin. Acts 2:38, 39; Luke 13:3, 5; The Acts of
                         the Apostles, page 560; Counsels to Teachers, page 361. It is
                         not our task to sit in judgment. Rom. 2:1; Matt. 7:1, 2; John
                         8:7; John 5:22. It is our work to represent Christ to fallen
                         men in such a way as to bring hope rather than condemnation,
                         joy rather than sorrow. John 3:17.
                            In the story of the woman taken in adultery, "Jesus is not
                         stating a general principle, one that would make absolute sin-
                         lessness the necessary condition of fitness for taking part in the
                         punishment of guilt. This would nullify law, for no one fitted
                         to carry out the execution could be found. He speaks here of a
                         case where men set themselves up as judges of others, whom
                         they ought not to condemn unless they themselves be guilt-
                         less. Jesus abhorred adultery . . . , but He also abhorred self-
                         righteous judging."—SDA Bible Commentary, on John 8:7.
                           What words of assurance did Jesus speak to the
                         woman taken in adultery? John 8:11.




                            One other point should be observed in this story. Jesus
                         might have seemed a bit harsh toward those who pointed the
                         finger of accusation, but He was most anxious to reach them
                         too. In His kindness for them, He wrote in the sand the sins
                         He read on their hearts when He could have shouted them to
                         all in hearing range. This is the God who is concerned for us
                         today, the One who is sensitive to human feelings and needs.
                         See Steps to Christ, page 12.
 THINK IT THROUGH           What do you think of this idea? "Those who are for-
                         ward in accusing others, and zealous in bringing them
                         to justice, are often in their own lives more guilty than
                         they."—"The Desire of Ages," page 462.

         Phil. 1:3-7 grace."

                          Paul's strong desire was to communicate the truth about
                       God to any man that would listen. He received added joy
                       whenever he heard or witnessed growth and progress in the
                       lives of his converts (Eph. 1:15, 16), but felt greatly pained
                       and disturbed whenever a group was bogged down with prob-
                       lems. Gal. 1:6; 3:1.
                          So it is with the Godhead. God keeps close supervision over
                       the operation of the church and the growth of each "pillar."
                       See Testimonies to Ministers, page 15. God is not too busy to
                       hold secure each individual committed. Zech. 2:8; Isa. 49:15,
                       16 ; Matt. 10:30. "The soul that is yielded to Christ becomes
                       His own fortress, which He holds in a revolted world, and He
                       intends that no authority shall be known in it but His own.
                        A soul thus kept in possession by the heavenly agencies is im-

                       324.
                           The disciples were secure in their individual relationships
                        with God, and just as the Godhead gave completely, so the
                        disciples gave completely for mankind. Paul's desire for Felix,
                        Agrippa, and Festus (Acts 24:25; 26:29) to know the joy of
                        a heavenly relationship rather than his thinking of himself is
                        one illustration. John and Peter's experience (Acts 3:1-8) in
                        healing a lame man is another. These are only two of many
                        examples of committed men and their desire to share.
                           For what reasons was Paul happy? Phil. 1:6, 7.

                        strated in its most perfect form. But in the history of man
                        there have been some worthy examples of love: Hosea and his
                        steadfast love for his wayward wife; Paul's love and concern
                        for Onesimus and Philemon; and the father in the story of the
                        prodigal son.

                        is selfish. The way back to God begins when man can honestly

                          Purity—freedom from foulness; faultlessness; guiltlessness;
                       freedom from foreign matter. See 1 Tim. 4:12 ; 5:2, 22.

                       received in Christ, it becomes our thought. It lifts us above the
                       power of natural desires and tendencies, above temptations
                       that lead to sin." (Italics supplied.) The seventh command-
                       ment is part of God's law. Why do we allow the devil to harass
                       us with unclean mental pictures? Why do we stand for the
                       uncomfortable, impure feelings that come into mind and cause
                       guilt? Do we excuse ourselves when our emotions are "touched,"
                       by saying, "These feelings are only human feelings, and I can't
                       help myself"? Would God ask a man for a pure heart (mind)
                       if it were an impossible task? 1 Tim. 5:2, 22; 2 Cor. 6:6;
                       1 John 3:1-9; Counsels to Teachers, page 103.
                           The Bible says, "Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall
                       see God." Matt. 5:8. What a privilege it is, by the grace of
                        God, to achieve purity of heart! See SDA Bible Commentary,
                       on Matt. 5:8.
                          What did Jesus say was the same as committing the
                        physical act of adultery? Matt. 5:28.




  THINK IT THROUGH        Do we have a responsibility to each other within the
                        church in accomplishing this attitude of purity? What do
                        you think it is?

                         Patience—endurance; fortitude; enduring pain and annoy-
                      ances without complaint; self-control under conditions that
                      provoke. For Biblical usage see SDA Bible Dictionary, on
                      "Patience."
                         We have heard a great deal about "the patience of the
                      saints." Rev. 14:12. This is not a quality that will be per-
                      fected in a few hours. While you read this lesson in the midst
                      of your child's play or ponder its principles while standing in
                      the middle of a crisis moment at work, you are developing this
                      quality. And each time that you successfully control the temp-
                      tation to speak scolding words or •threaten your fellows, you
                      are giving patience an opportunity to deepen in your life. Pa-
                      tience is an art. An art develops by practice.
                         Temperance—self-control; ability to check or regulate, to
                      restrain, or •to govern self. For Biblical usage see SDA Bible
                      Dictionary, on "Temperance."
                         This grace makes it possible for one to be patient, to toler-
                      ate, to stand by and see something through to the end. Paul
                      told the church at Corinth that those striving for the mastery
                      would be "temperate in all things." 1 Cor. 9:25. A real test
                      comes when one has lost sleep or is tirod. See Testimonies, Vol.
                      7, p. 199. Jesus was tired on the night of His trial—yet He gave
                      no thought to His own feelings. He was pushed, kicked, and
                      spat upon; but never an angry word escaped His lips. Matt.
                      27:26-31. James spoke an eternal truth when he pointed out
                      that the man who controls his tongue is a wise man. James
                      3:2-8, 13.

                         Knowledge—acquaintance with fact; awareness; under-
                      standing. For Biblical usage see SDA Bible Commentary, on
                      Daniel 1:17.
                         Knowledge is necessary for us to become aware, such as the
                      knowledge about our wonderful God and His concern for man-
                      kind. Knowledge is to be "coveted" as long as one gains it for
                      the honor of God. See Messages to Young People, pages 36, 37.
                      The attitude of Solomon in his early years was to be admired.
                      Is our attitude similar? What is the source of our knowledge?
                      Is it from God (Dan. 1:17) or from man?
                         Wisdom—the power of judging rightly and following a
                      sound course of action based on knowledge, experience and
                      understanding. For Biblical usage see SDA Bible Dictionary, on
                      "Wisdom."
                         The Bible states that "the mouth of the righteous speaketh
                      wisdom." Ps. 37:30. Wisdom describes how to accomplish
                      something; it is the skill or judgment which makes it possible
                       for an individual to act effectively. In this case, it might be
                       how Christians, by the help of God, realize a continually grow-
                       ing experience with Christ. But not all wisdom is of God
                       (1 Cor. 3:19), and not all "wise" men are in a safe position
                       (1 Cor. 1:26, 27; 3:20). We are wise only when in a relation-
                       ship with God we are growing according to His plan.

                          "And the peace of God, which passeth all understand-
                       ing, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ
                       Jesus."

            Phil. 4:7 gentleness of Christ, who in presence am base among
         2 Cor. 10:1 you, but being absent am bold toward you."

                          Joy—the emotion excited by the expectation of good, well-
                       being, or success. For Biblical usage see SDA Bible Commen-
                       tary, on Rom. 14:17.
                          A fully committed life brings this attribute-into being in the
                       life of the Christian. It makes the personality positive and
                       dynamic. Joy reveals to the outside world the peace that
                       floods the inside. Trial does not discourage this Christian
                       (1 Peter 4:12, 13) ; it only makes him "shine" brighter.
                          Peace—tranquillity, quietness; mental or spiritual state of
                       mind in which there is freedom from disquieting and perturbing
                       fears, passions, or conflicts. For Biblical usage see SDA Bible
                       Commentary, on John 14:27.
                          This attribute is of value to the Christian in two ways:
                       (1) physically and emotionally it allows him to relax and live
                       as God intended, and (2) mentally it allows the mind to be
                       clear so that he can help himself and his fellowmen to know
                       God and His will. John 14:27; 16:33.
                          Gentleness—mildness of manners or disposition. For Bibli-
                       cal usage see SDA Bible Commentary, on Gal. 5:22.
                          Gentleness does not imply that one must become subject to
                       defeat or abuse consistently. It implies a quality of firm kind-
                       ness, strength, and self-control combined with a calm, quiet
                       disposition. Gentleness is considered a "passive" virtue, but
                       very essential. See The Ministry of Healing, page 497.
                          What is the peace that God gives? Phil. 4:7.

                        and honesty."
        1 Tim. 2:1, 2      "And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your
          2 Peter 1:5 faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge."

                            Godliness—careful observance of, or conformity to, the
                        laws of God. For Biblical usage see SDA Bible Dictionary, on
                        "Godliness."
                            This virtue being associated with a Christian implies that
                         one can live a right life under the direction of God. Paul spoke
                         favorably of this attribute as he wrote to his young minister
                         friends. 1 Tim. 2:2; 6:6; Titus 1:1. But he also warned of a
                         false brand, characterized by "having the form . . . , but
                         denying the power thereof." Concerning this he instructed,
                         "turn away." 2 Tim. 3:5. Note Phillips's translation: "They will
                         maintain a façade of 'religion,' but their conduct will deny its
                         validity." Let no one make fun of you for paying an honest
                         tithe, for keeping all of God's commandments, for going to
                         church on Saturday, for helping the poverty-stricken. Just be
                         certain of your motives for doing these deeds. God will honor
                         your faithfulness, and you will continue to grow more and more
                         like Him.
                             Virtue—strength, courage, moral excellence. For Biblical
                         usage, see SDA Bible Commentary, on 2 Peter 1:3, 5.
                            This ends our discussion on the "elements" that make up
                         the Christian's moral code for today. Let it never be said that
                         Christianity is an easy way of life. Matt. 7:13, 14. Jesus was
                         strong, not weak. He was meek, but He was also courageous
                         and firm. So His followers must be strong, courageous, and
                         morally excellent. This is virtue. And this goal can be accom-
                         plished by a living relationship with God.



  THINK IT THROUGH          Is Christianity a "soft" way of life or does it "soften"
                         one's life?




    "Christian life is more than many         that Christ marks out is a narrow, self-

   "Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey
not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the
wives; while they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear. Whose
adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wear-
ing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; but let it be the hidden man of the
heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet
spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price." 1 Peter 3:1-4.


   Among the important social relationships      as to give to the world an object lesson of
on earth is that of marriage and family          what families who love God and keep His

                            Marriage calls for oneness in the sense that two people are
                         growing toward a mutual understanding in certain vital areas
                         —attitudes, customs, goals, values, likes and dislikes—and yet
                         individuality is preserved. Concerning individuality, Ellen
                         White says, "Her individuality cannot be merged into that of
                         her husband, for she is the purchase of Christ. It is a mistake
                         to imagine that with blind devotion she is to do exactly as her
                         husband says in all things, when she knows that in so doing,
                         injury would be worked for her body and her spirit, which
                         have been ransomed from the slavery of Satan."—The Ad-
                         ventist Home, page 116.
                            The oneness in marriage comes when husbands and wives
                         treat each other with mutual respect and devotion (Col. 3:18,
                         19; Eph. 5:22, 23, 25; 1 Peter 3:1, 7) and keep the spirit of
                         the golden rule. Matt. 7:12. These principles are applicable in
                         homes where different religious goals and values are cherished.
                         A devoted believer, in silent witness, attracts to God much
                         more powerfully than a nagging sermonizer. See 1 Peter 3:1-4.

     MUTUAL LOVE,       it is fit in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives, and be
      HONOR, AND        not bitter against them."
            RESPECT
      IN MARRIAGE
                           It has been stated that God did not take Eve from man's
                        foot; thus woman is not to be trampled upon. And God did
       Col. 3:18, 19    not take woman from man's head; thus she is not to rule the
                        man. Instead, she was taken from the region of man's heart
                        —thus mutual love, honor, and respect are to rule in Christian
                        marriage. See Testimonies, Vol. 7, pp. 45-50; Gen. 2:21-24;
                        1 Peter 3:1, 7. "Submit" in Col. 3:18 (also in Eph. 5:22; Rom.
                        10:3; James 4:7; 1 Peter 5:5) means "to put oneself under
                        orders," coming from the idea of knowing and willingly ac-
                        cepting one's rank or order. This word needs careful study by
                        both husbands and wives, for it is a command from God. It is
                        quite easy to see what happens when the word "submit" is
                        misunderstood or ignored.
                           "The ethics of Christian relationships within the family are
                        clear when once it is seen that difference and subordination do
                        not in any sense imply inferiority. The submission enjoined
                        upon the wife is of the kind that can be given only between
                        equals, not a servile obedience, but a voluntary submission in
                        the respects in which the man was qualified by his Maker to
                        be head. . . . This principle of submission is permanent, but
                        its specific application may vary from age to age according to
                        custom and social consciousness."—SDA Bible Commentary,
                        on Eph. 5:22.
                            Marriage is a mutual relationship. If it is to reach the ideal,
                        both partners must consent to the principle of the golden rule
                        and concentrate on the development of a character made from
                        the building blocks discovered in Lesson Two.
                           What attitude should the husband have toward his
                        wife? What admonition is given to the wife? Eph. 5:22,
                        23, 25.




  THINK IT THROUGH         What might be one word that would summarize the
                        ideal relationship between husband and wife?


   "We must have the Spirit of God, or       he will not be arbitrary and exacting.
we can never have harmony in the             We cannot cherish home affection with

        Eph. 5:28, 29 isheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church."

                           In our day the term "compatibility" defines the necessary
                        attitudes and desires for getting along harmoniously together
                        in a marriage relationship.
                           Some of the areas connected with compatibility include the
                        following: (1) Finance. (Who takes care of the money? Does
                        the wife work? What about credit and installment buying,
                        et cetera?) (2) Children and family life. (Agreements on a
                        mutual, loying relationship between husband and wife, when
                        to have children and how many, et cetera. (3) Likes and dis-
                        likes. (Agreements about likes and dislikes—are they major
                        and impossible to change, or can an understanding be ac-
                        complished?) (4) Self-fulfillment. (Personal goals discussed
                        and agreements reached.) (5) Education. (How much is needed,
                        choice of life's work, wife's education goals and future con-
                        sidered.) (6) Religious and cultural backgrounds. (Are they
                        the same? How -will our marriage succeed if they are not?
                        How can I fulfill 2 Cor. 6:14-16 and still accept difference in
                        this area?)
                           These are important items for consideration, but God asks
                        us also to consider the importance of the simple virtues found
                        in Prov. 31:10-31. If the husband expects the wife to respect
                        him and treat him as her "king," should he not set an ex-
                        ample of godly living for her? And if the wife expects the hus-
                        band to treat her with admiration and honor, should she not
                        seek to excel in these ideals?
                           In homes where only one is a believer, the role of a virtuous
                        mate has an exceptionally large function. The golden rule can
                        do more to win than a thousand sermons. Love in action is
                        hard to deny. 1 Peter 3:1-4; 1 Cor. 7:12-16; SDA Bible Com-
                        mentary, on 1 Cor. 7:12-16.
                            What is the value of a virtuous woman to a man? How
                        is the man to treat the wife?




 THINK IT THROUGH           Do I allow church activities (Dorcas work, committees,
                        et cetera) or my profession to become an avenue of sel-
                        fishness for my personal gain, thereby cheating my mate
                        of God-ordained attention and devotion?

      TO CHILDREN     but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the
          Col. 3:21   Lord."
           Eph. 6:4
                         Much has been written and discussed on the subject of the
                      "generation gap" (communication breakdown between two
                      generations), but God has never intended His creatures to in-
                      terrelate in any other fashion than in terms of understanding
                      and mutual fellowship. This includes the parent-child and
                      parent-teen relationships as well.
                         The message of reformation that came to Malachi (Mal.
                      4:5, 6) and that was later repeated to the people of Christ's day
                      (Luke 1:17) included the admonition that "the hearts of the
                      fathers" should be turned "to the children." "The declaration
                      of Malachi, here cited by Luke, has . . . been explained literally
                      as applying to parental responsibility in bringing up children
                      in 'the nurture and admonition of the Lord' (Eph. 6:4). . . .
                      The home is certainly included in the work of reform here
                      described as being an important aspect of making 'ready a
                      people prepared for the Lord.' "—SDA Bible Commentary, on
                      Luke 1:17.
                         The word "provoke" in Col. 3:21 means to incite or stir up
                      anger, hostility, or the urge to fight. Patience, firmness, com-
                      munication, and understanding will go farther in dealing with
                      growing children and their problems than authoritarianism and
                      force. See The Adventist Home, pages 292-316; SDA Bible

           Eph. 6:1-3
                            The word "obey" means •"to accord with another's com-
                         mands or wishes." Parents and teachers have a large part to
                         play in leading and communicating a right way of life to
                         children and teen-agers. Children are commanded to "obey"
                         in the Lord. We are commanded not Ito "provoke" them to
                         anger but to train them according to the admonition of the
                         Lord. Eph. 6:4. The kind of firmness and discipline urged .by
                         the wise man (Prov. 13:24; 23:13) is certainly needed now.
                         But much that is called discipline today is nothing but mis-
                         placed hostility and aggression. See Child Guidance, pages 244-
                         257. If children and teen-agers are to obey "in the Lord," they
                         will have to be treated always like persons, never like "objects."
                         Even though our day might not be long enough, it must in-
                         clude some time for companionship where children and teen-
                         agers may know that they count, where they feel that someone
                         "reads them" and listens to how they feel rather than to be
                         involved in a heated debate over what they say. See The Ad-

                       qualities in each other. The consciousness of being appreciated

          Lev. 19:18        Two questions need to be answered: "Who is my neighbor?"
                         and "What is my duty toward my neighbor?"
                            The first question may be answered by saying that anyone
                         in need is my neighbor, regardless of race, creed, or color.
                         Christ's Object Lessons, page 376. It may be "poverty" of any
                         kind—spiritual, physical, or social. Regardless of the kind, it
                         is my privilege to represent God in this world and to relieve
                         the pain of poverty. Matt. 25:34-40; James 1:27.
                           How does God want me to feel toward my neighbor?
                         Matt. 22:39.



                             Are there those in my church that are "poverty-
                         stricken"? Which is more urgent—to relieve the pain of
                         poverty within the church or outside of the church?




                            The second question is answered by the Scriptural reference
                         —"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." This includes the
                         unlovables (Matt. 9:10-12), the stranger (Matt. 15:21-28), the
                         enemies (Luke 6:27, 35; 22:50, 51), the gifted (John 3:1-13),
                         those who are the objects of discrimination (John 4:1-26),
                         just to mention a few. My duty as a neighbor is not to judge
                         or criticize, but to be a "light" shining in a "dark,place." Matt.
                         5:13-16; SDA Bible Commentary, on Lev. 19:18.
 THINK IT THROUGH           In doing Christian works, what is more important, my
                         motive for doing the deed, or doing the deed because
                         other Christians do it?

                            In Testimonies, Vol. 5, pp. 178-182, a story is related con-
                        cerning a man who thought it was proper to take life easy and
                        "'drift." Two counts were charged against him. The first con-
                        cerned his conduct and business habits. They were so deplor-
                        able that he was warned that if he did not change, his example
                        might endanger the reputations of his Christian brethren. The
                        second count was his example and conduct in his home. His
                        sons copied his habit of laziness while the wife toiled unend-
                        ingly to do all the work. The solution that was offered for this
                        problem was self-discipline in the life.
                            Our needs have not changed. The quality of one's life deter-
                        mines the quality of our neighborliness. And the way we
                         achieve quality in the first place is by self-discipline in the life.
                        The Bible writers were concerned that Christians carry their
                         religion with them. They were to be industrious, not idle
                         (slothful) or motionless. Prov. 22:29; 10:4; Rom. 12:11; Matt.
                         2.5:21. Religion was not to be a mere performance; it was to
                         be real living. This living demonstration was meant for the
                         street, the workshop, the office, the ball game, the home, the
                         social occasion. No shades of difference, no degrees of intensity,
                         were to be witnessed. Simply a consistent, trustworthy example
                         of living communion with God was recommended by our Lord.

       Matt. 5:43, 44
                            Do you have enemies? Can you see yourself going to them
                         and treating them with kindness? Can you visualize yourself
                         not murmuring when a Christian brother takes advantage of

                         Christ's example.
                            Your enemies are to be considered as valuable in the sight
                         of God. In fact, we are enemies to God unless we come to
                         God and experience a thorough change in our personal living
                         habits. Rom. 5:6-10; 2 Cor. 5:17. Christ loved His enemies.
                         Luke 23:34. We are to follow His example. God wants us to
                         be examples of reconciliation, not judges or condemnatory or
                         sharp-tongued servants of gossip or backbiting. Thoughts From
                         the Mount of Blessing, page 75.
                            It is easy to love the lovely. But it is quite another thing
                         to love the unlovely, the gruff, the contemptuous, the stern,
                         the unkind. Matt. 5:43-47. However, God loves and remembers
                         all men, for He is the Creator and Redeemer of all. And,
                         while He could easily spread the good news of reconciliation,
                         He has chosen His professed disciples as His instruments. How
                         can our message have any force if we hate our enemies? See

       BE SOCIABLE       house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and
      TO ALL PEOPLE      sat down with Him and His disciples. And when the
                         Pharisees saw it, they said unto His disciples, Why eateth
                         your Master with publicans and sinners? But when Jesus

                            It is rather easy to befriend those who are accepted by so-
                         ciety. But those who need our help are the ones who are
                         rejected. Jesus chose to sit with the publican, the sinner, the
                         scorned, because they knew their need. Wealth, popularity, and
                         security often tend to make a person feel little need for God.
                         Perhaps this is because man has a habit of viewing himself as
                         one who is fairly well off. Matt. 19:16-26. This state of mind
                         is dangerous because the Bible clearly says that man is lawless
                         and there is nothing good in him. Rom. 3:23; Isa. 64:6.
                            We, as disciples of Christ, are called to minister to all re-
                         gardless of class, creed, or color. God needs men who are not
                         afraid for their reputation to walk as Jesus walked among men
                         in need. We have a source from which we can draw which
                         can make us lovable and loving Christians. 1 Cor. 13. We are
                         to be the lights in a dark world, giving hope and bringing
                         peace to fearful hearts.
                            The Christian should be concerned only that he feed on the
                         Living Bread and grow continually into the fullness of Christ.
                         John 6:48-51. Other than this, the Christian is called upon to
                         be open and friendly to all men just as his Lord so clearly
                         demonstrated at the feast in Matthew's house. See The Desire

                        just to mention a few.
                           Because of their stubbornness and unbelief, the disciples ex-
                        perienced a severe and life-threatening storm on Galilee. See
                        The Desire of Ages, page 380. Yet Christ ministered to them
                        with tender compassion. Likewise, though some of those in
                        trouble have caused their own misfortunes, Christ asks us to
                        follow His example in ministering to their needs.

                                                                          January 24
             Part 1        "For as the body is one, and hath many members, and
       THE CHURCH      all the members of that one body, being many, are one
         AS GOD'S      body: so also is Christ. For by one Spirit are we all bap-
     ORGANIZATION      tized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles,
                       whether we be bond or free; and have been all made
                       to drink into one Spirit. For the body is not one member,
     1 Cor. 12:12-14   but many."

                           God desires order and design. This is evident in all of His
                       creation. From the innocent beauty of the rose to the complex
                       systems of the galaxies observed by telescope, God consistently
                       gives evidence of His desire to have all things "done decently
                       and in order" (1 Cor. 14:40) ; and the operation of His church
                       is included.
                           The Old Testament people knew this system of orderliness.
                       Ex. 25:10 to 31:18. And it was not neglected in the New Tes-
                       tament. Paul speaks of this subject and refers to the church as
                       a body with many members. In the SDA Bible Commentary,
                       on 1 Cor. 12:12, we read: "The human body is one organism,
                       but it is composed of various members and parts, each having
                       its own indispensable function, and all uniting harmoniously
                       in one whole. Though the different parts of the body are separ-
                       ate and distinct in their shape, size, and functions, they are all
                       essential, and all unite in making up the entire body, and are
                       all under the same guiding power, the head.
                           "The apostle represents the church as the body of Christ,
                       signifying that it is one united body, with Christ as its head
                       (see 1 Cor. 12:27; Eph. 1:22, 23; Col. 1:18-24). By a figure
                       of speech a part is here made to represent the whole. Christ,
                       the head of the church, stands for the entire church. All the
                       members of the church are separate individuals, having vary-
                       ing offices and responsibilities in the church. For these tasks
                       they receive gifts from God appropriate to their individual
                       needs, but they all are answerable to Christ and are united in
                       Him."
                          What is the church likened to?




 THINK IT THROUGH         How can the church be organized and still act in a
                       spontaneous fashion as in the days of the apostles?

                                                                          January 25:
             Part 2 '    "Beloved, let us love one another:: for love is of God;
        HARMONY and everyone that loveth is born of God, and.knoweth
      BEGINS WITH God."
     EACH MEMBER         "We love Him, because He first, loved us. IC a man
                      say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for
                      he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how.•.
  1 John 4:7, 19, 20 can he love God whom he hath not.seen?"

                          Can men and women sit in the same church and hate each
                       other and still be useful to God? How effectively we could
                       work for God if we knew the art of love ! 1 Corinthians 13.
                       Unity within the church begins within the mind and heart of
                       every member. The moral values of patience, self-control,
                       brotherly kindness, gentleness, purity, just to name a few, are
                       equally as essential in the church today as they were in apostolic
                       times.
                           Harmony does not destroy individuality. Ellen G. White
                       says, "The religion of Christ does not require us to lose our
                       identity of character, but merely to adapt ourselves, in some
                       measure, to the feelings and ways of others. Many people may
                       be brought together in a unity of religious faith whose opinions,
                       habits, and tastes in temporal matters are not in harmony; but
                       if they have the love of Christ glowing in their bosoms, and
                       are looking forward to the same heaven as their eternal home,
                       they may have the sweetest and most intelligent communion
                       together, and a unity the most wonder ful."—Testimonies, Vol.
                       4, p. 65.
                          Can a man love God and hate his brother? 1 John
                       4:20.




 THINK IT THROUGH         Discuss what would happen in your church if all of
                       the members turned Worn their differences and applied
                       the principle of love.

                                                                           January 26
              Part 3         "Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also
      JESUS' PRAYER      which shall believe on Me through their word; that they
                         all may be one; as Thou, Father, art in Me, and I in
                         Thee, that they also may be one in Us: that the world
      John 17:20, 21     may believe that Thou bast sent Me."

                            How thoughtful of Jesus to remember His disciples in every
                         generation. It was His wish, and it still is, that we might be
                         "one" as He and His Father are one. The SDA Bible Commen-
                         tary, on John 17:21, makes this comment: "There would be
                         diversities of gifts (1 Cor. 12), but there was to be unity of
                         spirit, objectives, and beliefs. There were to be no strivings
                         for supremacy such as had recently plagued the Twelve (Luke
                         22:24-30). The unity springing from the blended lives of
                         Christians would impress the world of the divine origin of the
                         Christian church."
                            What does it mean to become "one"? Do I have to sur-
                         render my individuality or live as another person? Not at all.
                         We have learned that God has created each of us to be a dif-
                         ferent and distinct person. See Lesson 3, Part 1; Testimonies,
                         Vol. 3, p. 484; Education, page 17; Counsels on Health, pages
                         243, 244. God is concerned that we be "one" in mind, purpose,
                         and character, but not in person. See The Ministry of Healing,
                         page 422 ; Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary,
                         Vol. 5, p. 1148. Perhaps mind means to present an honest,
                         united front which would convince the world that Christ is the
                         only Saviour of mankind; purpose, to proclaim and clarify
                         the plan whereby fallen men may become the sons of God;
                         character, to reveal the "building blocks" essential for every
                         man in his quest to become like God and depart from law-
                         lessness and rebellion. All this must be in cooperation with the
                         Godhead, and yet within the framework of our own person-
                         alities. What freedom! A freedom of heavenly origin that we
                         are allowed to experience while we remain in this world.
                            Why is unity so important? John 17:21.



 THINK IT THROUGH           What do you think is meant by the statement: "They
                         are one in purpose, in mind, in character, but not in
                         person"?—"The Ministry of Healing," page 422.

Church Relations       LESSON 5                                      ❑ Wednesday
                                                                          January 27
              Part 4       "And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which
   RESPONDING TO        labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and
       LEADERSHIP       admonish you; and to esteem them very highly in love
   1 Thess. 5:12, 13    for their work's sake. And be at peace among yourselves."

                           As members of the church who were baptized in the name
                        of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, we have the
                        solemn but joyful responsibility of proclaiming the "good
                        news" to all mankind.
                           But another spot within the church that needs our atten-
                        tion is that area dealing with our attitude toward church lead-
                        ers. In a time of self-proclaimed "freedom," a time of rebel-
                        lion, it is not unusual to hear church members debating over
                        the rightness or wrongness of a decision made by the local
                        church board. Or some may question the reason for one mem-
                        ber's being placed in leadership when someone else "more
                        capable" was omitted or rejected. Rather than sitting in judg-
                        ment, we are asked to pray for and encourage our church
                        leaders and show an active concern in the operation of the
                        church. 1 Thess. 5:25; 2 Thess. 3:1; 2 Cor. 7:6, 7, 13.
                           Perhaps we can learn a vital lesson of respect for church
                        leaders from David, who refused to touch "the Lord's an-
                        nointed" when he could have taken the life of Saul, his enemy.
                        1 Sam. 26:5-25; Patriarchs and Prophets, pages 668-671. Do
                        we have what we consider weak leaders in church office today?
                        Do we wonder why they are there? Let us remember that God
                        is still at the helm of His church. 1 Cor. 12:28; Acts 5:39. Let
                        us, then, do our work well, respect and reverence our church
                        leaders (1 Tim. 5:17; Heb. 13:7, 17), and pray that we may
                        develop in our lives the fruits of the Spirit. Gal. 5:22, 23;
                        2 Peter 1:5-8. See also Lesson 2.
                            How well are we to know our church leaders?




 THINK IT THROUGH           Discuss: It is human to criticize, but it is godly to work
                         toward unity.




  "There have ever been in the church       ment of his brethren, especially of those

             Part 5      "But Jesus called them unto Him, and said, Ye know
       RIGHT KIND that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over
        OF LEADER them, and they that are great exercise authority upon
                      them. But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever
                      will be great among you, let him be your minister; and
                      whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your
                      servant: even as the Son of man came not to be minis-
                      tered unto, but to minister, and to give His life a ransom
      Matt. 20:25-28 for many."

                           "In His life and lessons, Christ has given a perfect exempli-
                       fication of the unselfish ministry which has its origin in God.
                       God does not live for Himself. By creating the world, and by
                       upholding all things, He is constantly ministering for others.
                       . . . This ideal of ministry God has committed to His Son.
                       Jesus was given to stand at the head of humanity, that by His
                       example He might teach what it means to minister. His whole
                       life was under a law of service. He served all, ministered to
                       all. Thus He lived the law of God, and by His example showed
                       how we are to obey it.
                           "Again and again Jesus had tried to establish this principle
                       among His disciples. When James and John made their request
                       for pre-eminence, He had said, 'Whosoever will be great among
                       you, let him be your minister.' Matt. 20:26. In My kingdom
                       the principle of preference and supremacy has no place. The
                       only greatness is the greatness of humility. The only distinction
                       is found in devotion to the service of others."—The Desire of
                       Ages, pages 649, 650.
                           This description of leadership is quite foreign to our world.
                       Worldly leaders must rule by power and force, but church
                       leaders are to minister to others. They are "servants," looking
                       for ways to help and please their fellowmen. James 1:27.

                            What is the secret of a spiritual revival in God's church?
                         Could it be money or public relations or energetic leadership?
                         All of these are important. But the Scripture says, "And they,
                         continuing daily with one accord . . . , did eat their meat with
                         gladness and singleness of heart." What is the meaning of "one
                         accord"? In Acts 1:14 and 2:46 it means "persevered with one
                         mind." Note the following comment: "What a contrast to the
                         competitive spirit shown at the time of the Last Supper (Luke
                         22:24). How different in its calm, solemn joy was this period
                         of waiting. Here is the commencement of the 'accord' that bore
                         such dynamic results a few days later (Acts 2:1, 41)."—SDA

                            Have the requirements changed today? Isn't the need the
                         same? We are told, "The lapse of time has wrought no change
                         in Christ's parting promise to send the Holy Spirit as His rep-
                         resentative. It is not because of any restriction on the part of
                         God that the riches of His grace do not flow earthward to
                         men. If the fulfillment of the promise is not seen as it might
                         be, it is because the promise is not appreciated as it should
                         be. If all were willing, all would be filled with the Spirit."

                            Action that is motivated by men is man-sized, but action
                         that is stimulated by God cannot be measured by human cal-
                         culations. Zech. 4:6. Perhaps we need to comprehend more

                          Nero was the emperor who ordered Paul's execution, yet
                       Paul counsels obedience to civil power. Paul argues for gov-

                       special form of government. He opposes all lawlessness and
                       disorder. He emphasizes that Christianity and good citizenship
                       go hand in hand. God has ordained human government and
                       law. Without them there would be no order, security, or
                       progress among men.
                          What action of the Christian will win the approval of
                       governing powers? Rom. 13:3, last part.


                          Pharaoh was placed on the throne by God that through
                       him the power of God could be revealed. Pharaoh would be
                       used to declare the name and glory and power of God to all
                       the earth. Ex. 9:16. He could do this willingly or unwillingly.
                       Willingly he would be the hero, unwillingly the villian. Nebu-
                       chadnezzar was humbled before he was willing to declare the
                       power and glory of God. See Daniel 4. Pharaoh was given
                       every opportunity to serve God and so glorify the name of
                       God, but he would not yield. He hardened his heart.
                          Where do authorities, good and bad, receive power
                       to govern? Rom. 13:1.

 THINK IT THROUGH         If all power comes from God, why are there persecut-
                       ing rulers? Why is there ever a conflict between the au-

          SPIRITUAL
        Matt. 22:21         With a simple illustration Christ showed the duties we
                         should render to both civil and religious authorities. This illus-
                         tration could not be misunderstood. Caesar had his part to
                         perform, and within his area he was in command. The ques-
                         tioners of Jesus desired to be released from their responsibility
                         to Caesar. By His reply Christ emphasized their duty to civil
                         government. At the same time He made it clear that there was
                         an allegiance to God that commanded obedience.
                             Who is declared to be the ruler of the heathen na-
                         tions? Ps. 47:7, 8.

                            The power to rule the material world is given state authori-
                         ties by God. Rom. 13:1. God has reserved to Himself final
                         allegiance. Political and civil responsibilities are given by Him
                         through the agencies He has ordained for that purpose. The
                         state should not ask anything from a Christian that he cannot
                         give within the terms of his commitment to God. The state
                         should recognize the higher obligation.

                             The state is an instrument in the hand of God. It can be
                         used to preserve the world from chaos. The officer of the state
                         is doing God's will when he promotes law and order and makes
                         it possible for men to live harmoniously together. No law-abid-
                         ing citizen need fear a government that promotes peace and

                            Some of the best-loved rulers have been those who realized
                         their dependence on God. For example, David was honored by
                         Israel when he walked humbly before God; but when he be-
                         came self-indulgent, he no longer held the love of his people
                         and was beset by opposition and rebellion.
 THINK IT THROUGH             What are the characteristics of a government that ful-

                         The church is urged to pray for certain definite things.
                      The Christian citizen's prayer for his country is for a life that
                      is tranquil and undisturbed, for a time of peace, free from war,
                      free from rebellion, free from anything which would disturb
                      the peace of the realm.
                          Paul admonished Christians to pray for non-Christian rulers,
                      some of whom were enemies of the church. Even in times of
                      bitterest persecution the Church brought her' persecutors before

                          Why does the Christian recognize no man as an
                       enemy? Rom. 13:8.




                           "No matter how high the profession, he whose heart is not
                       filled with love for God and his fellowmen is not a true disciple
                       of Christ."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 318.
                          How is a Christian to relate himself to the laws of the
                       land? 1 Peter 2:13, 14; Eccl. 8:2.




                         "It is not our work to attack individuals or institutions. We

                            What did Christ mean by the "world"? See 1 John 5:19.


                            God never intended that Christians should be isolated in a
                         spiritual enclave. They are to be "in" but not "of." Matt.
                         5:13-16.
                            In a world of obvious iniquity the Christian may escape
                         the taint of association with sin and sinners. 1 John 2:15-17.
                         Early Christianity experienced a sudden flush of monasticism.
                         Even today many seek complete isolation from worldly in-
                         fluences.

                            Do not confuse friendship with friendliness. A warm, friendly
                        attitude to all is part of Christian grace. Christ had compas-
                        sion on the multitude. Matt. 15:32. He moved with friendliness
                        and soul-seeking love among sinners and publicans. But when
                        it comes to deep associations, lasting friendships, we cannot
                        show too much care.
                            Friendship is based on a measure of common interest, time
                        spent in communion and communication, mutual attraction
                        and choice.
                           How did Ruth express the need for deep friendships
                        to have a spiritual basis? Ruth 1:16-18.


                          Is it possible to maintain a deep friendship with a
                        non-Christian without risk? Amos 3:3.


                            How does Christ speak of His choice of friends? John
                         15:14-16.


  THINK IT THROUGH          How do I react to Christians of other faiths? to worldly

                            Friendliness wins souls. Our great evangelists repeatedly
                         remind us that much of their success depends on the attitude
                         of the members to their neighbors. "Social power, sanctified by
                         the grace of Christ, must be improved in winning souls to the

                           Why do most non-Christians look upon Christianity as
                       a life of deprivation and negation? 1 Cor. 2:12-14.




                          Are there some social activities in which a Christian may
                       not indulge? Social activities with our business associates per-

                           "Recreation is needful to those who are engaged in physical

                           Finding a balance between relaxation, recreation, and work
                        presents difficulty. Only forty hours a week is needed for many
                        to earn their living. Relaxation, rest, leisure, describe a pas-
                        sive state. Recreation shows how we use our time in activity
                        to rebuild our energies both physical and mental.
                           What was it that brought upon the disciples the need
                        for rest? Mark 6:30, 31.


                           Do you think this was the only time Jesus offered
                        them opportunity of recreation? What did they lack?
                        Verse 31.


                           Could our example in recreation be harmless to us
                        but hurtful to the spiritual experience of others? What
                        must we remember in our search for recreation? Rom.

 THINK IT THROUGH          Are my hobbies, my sports, my entertainments all of
                        a nature that heaven can approve? Do they banish Christ
                        from my mind? What criteria would I list for my own per-

                           A spiritual work of re-creation stems from the sacrifice on
                        the cross. Just as this changes our spiritual lives, physical
                        recreation changes our physical lives. The spiritual is linked
                        with the physical. 1 Cor. 6:19, 20.
                            What goal should recreation have? Many things that
                         are not evil in themselves do have the potential of abuse.

                     down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he
                     passed by on the other side. And likewise a Levite, when
                     he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed
                     by on the other side. But a certain Samaritan, as he

                           "He [the Samaritan] did not question whether the stranger
                         was a Jew or a Gentile. If a Jew, the Samaritan well knew
                         that, were their condition reversed, the man would spit in his

                         on account of this. He did not consider that he himself might
                         be in danger of violence by tarrying in the place. It was enough

                         Does this mean that all men are equally acceptable to God?
                         Christ showed His concern by dying—the Father by suffering
                         with the Son. How does the Christian show his concern?
                            Should all our good deeds be directed toward the

                            Privilege carries responsibility. Responsibility includes all
                         of God's children. "In the human brotherhood it takes all

                            What privilege is given God's people? Gal. 3:28, 29.




                            What are the responsibilities that come with this privilege
                         of being God's chosen people? Pure religion is included. James
                         1:27. We have a responsibility to live peaceably with all men
                         and to respect government. Rom. 13:1-7. We are to be servants
                         to all men. 1 Cor. 9:19. Do the underprivileged have respon-

 THINK IT THROUGH           This responsibility that comes with being a part of

  WHAT CAN I DO? shall be saved. How then shall they call on Him in whom
                   they have not believed? and how shall they believe in
                   Him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they

                         means. It means utilizing individual talents. It means letting

                           Consider the setting of Joel 2:28-31. Peter applied this to
                         Pentecost. Acts 2:16-21. What evidence indicates that it still
                         remains to be completely realized in the end of time? Compare
                         Joel 2:28-32 and Matt. 24:29, 30.
                            Remember that you are part of a unit with a great

                            Our good works have a definite effect on the salvation of
                         others. 1 Peter 2:12.
                            Note the personal involvement that Christ calls for in His
                         "inasmuch" admonition. Matt. 25:35-40. God needs our means,
                         our welfare centers and relief vans. He must have our hospitals,
                         our medical launches and mercy planes, but above all He needs
                         us—involved, committed. And just as much as He needs us to
                         finish His work, we also need this personal involvement.
                            What pleases God in the religion of His people? Isa.

                         Verses 13, 14. Needs exist at home and abroad that would
                         overwhelm the resources of the church without God's help.
                            What did Paul say of the financial condition of the

      John 15:12, 13
                           For the Christian, right acts begin with love. Laying down
                        our lives is not alone dying in an act of bravery or martyrdom.
                        It includes a continuous offering of ourselves for the benefit
                        and salvation of others. This is what Christ did.
                            Love is not just a warm feeling. It includes benevolent acts
                        (James 1:27) ; seizing opportunity to do good to others (Gal.
                        6:10) ; loving those who hate us (Matt. 5:44-47). Love, then,
                        is Christ in action through us.
                           How may we increase this love? Where does it be-
                        gin? 1 John 4:17, 19.




                           Consider the Biblical description of love. 1 Cor. 13:4-8. How
                        would we apply love to the practical needs of helping our
                        neighbors? Think about "not easily provoked," "rejoiceth in
                        truth," "hopeth all things," "charity never faileth" as guiding
                        principles for our relationships with others.
                          What false motives sometime prompt benevolence?
                        Matt. 6:2-4.




  THINK IT THROUGH          What "image" am I projecting? How may the church
                        which I attend best help the needy in my community? Do
                        I love God enough to care? Do I care enough to act?

              Part 1     "Jesus came and spoke unto them, saying, All power
             GO YE! is given unto Me in heaven and in earth. Go ye there-
                      fore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name

                      teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have
                      commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even
      Matt. 28:18-20 unto the end of the world."

                            Jesus' command to evangelize is as direct as any other He
                         gave. Though evangelism is implied as part of the work of
                         the Jewish theocracy in the Old Testament, Christ's concept
                         of individual active evangelism is new. It is more than volun-
                         tarily coming to the church because it looks holy and good. It
                         is going into the highways and byways to compel others to
                         come in.
                            What attitude on the part of God does this commis-
                         sion reflect? 2 Peter 3:9.



                            Christ's name is the only one that saves. Acts 4:12. When
                         the world has received the message of Christ's saving love,
                         when all have had the opportunity to consider truth and de-
                         cide, God can justly conclude earth's probation.
                            Would it be enough to preach the gospel without
                         actively seeking out lost individuals? Mark 16:15.

              Part 2     "And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us
        WHO? ME? to Himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the min-
                      istry of reconciliation; to wit, that God was in Christ,
                      reconciling the world unto Himself, not imputing their
                      trespasses unto them, and hath committed unto us the
                      word of reconciliation. Now then we are ambassadors
                      for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray
      2 Cor. 5:18-20 you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God."

                           The "new creature" of verse 17 recognizes a responsibility
                        for others. Note the reference to "any man." Paul excludes no
                        one from the effect of conversion. It does not isolate us from
                        the world; it impels us to involve ourselves with the world's
                        needs.
                           What is the "word of reconciliation"?



                          For Paul, evangelism was a divine compulsion. After Da-
                        mascus he was never the same. He looked for Christ to reveal
                        Himself in his life. Gal. 1:15, 16.
                           What should we expect to happen when Christ fills
                        the life? 1 Cor. 2:2.



                          Paul subordinated his scholarly learning to the purpose of
                        evangelism. 1 Cor. 2:4, 5. Is it possible for a housewife, a uni-
                        versity professor, a computer programmer, a tradesman, to
                        regard his training in the same way as Paul did his?
 THINK IT THROUGH           "No man liveth unto himself." As I survey my circle of
                        influence, how can I operate for the salvation of souls
                        within these limits? Will training for service help? Should

                        as of the world. They profess to be seeking an immortal crown,
                        a treasure in the heavens; but their interest and principal study

                           How has God ordained that the gospel work should

                           What does the prophet mean by the "meat in Mine house"?
                        It means sustaining the services that pointed to Christ. It
                        means maintaining the witness of truth among the nations
                        surrounding Israel. Today providing "meat in Mine house"
                        includes supporting a sustained witness in all the world.

                          After the disappointment of 1844 some of the early pioneers
                       had a very limited vision. They felt that •the door of mercy
                       had been shut. Counsel through the spirit of prophecy and
                       from the Bible lifted the vision of the young church.
                       Within months they accepted a widening responsibility that
                       eventually included the world. Today almost the entire world
                       has access to the message in one form or another. Self-sacrifice
                       at home and abroad has built this mighty work for God.
                         How does the first angel describe the scope of his

                          Would the presence of the church in a country mean that

                            A knowledge of prophecy, and particularly the prophecies
                         of Daniel and Revelation, has made us a people. God is aiding
                         us in making the predictions of prophecy plain. Modern mass

                            When the early church faced the task of taking the gospel
                         out to the world, what did God do? Acts 2:2-4. The gift of
                         languages was the answer to their need. Our needs are different.

           Hosea 6:3    rain unto the earth."

                           God assures us that He will answer the cry of people for
                        spiritual infilling. Upon the parched ground of our souls He
                        will spill out the abundance of His Spirit.
                           How did the disciples prepare for the gifts of Pentecost?
                        Acts 2:1-4. Their major burden, the outcry of their hearts, was
                        to know how to answer the challenge Christ left them. See
                        The Acts of the Apostles, page 37.
                           How does individual witnessing share in the plan of God?
                        Acts 8:26-38. The servant of the Lord speaks of the people of
                        God as going from "door to door, with their faces lighted." She
                        says it is our responsibility to take the message "to every
                        man's door." Alongside heart preparation stands service. Our
                        preparation is honed in the clashes of the battle for souls.
                            How does heaven regard our best endeavors to extend
                         the kingdom of God? Luke 15:7. What reward comes to
                         the faithful servant? Ps. 126:5, 6. (Joy in heaven, joy on

                            "While the great final reward is given at Christ's coming,
                         truehearted service for God brings a reward even in this life."

                           Can an unconverted man obey Christ in spreading the mes-
                        sage of hope to every creature? This is utterly impossible. The
                        great commission was given only to converted men and women.
                           Only as one is converted is he equipped to go out in Jesus'
                        name and summon others for Christ. All who are converted
                        are •to do just this. The Holy Spirit fills a man who is con-
                        verted that the man might be sanctified himself and that he
                        might have power to win others by his witness.
                            When one is converted, selfishness and pride surrender
                        to the great principle of love. John 13:35.


                           When the Holy Spirit enters a man's heart, he loves
                        as God loves. Rom. 5:5.


                           Many would seek to make excuses for weakness rather than
                        recognize it for what it is and claim victory over it. "When
                        the Holy Spirit is poured out, there will be a triumph of hu-
                        manity over prejudice in seeking the salvation of the souls
                        of human beings. God will control minds. Human hearts will
                        love as Christ loved ."—T estimonies, Vol. 9, p. 209.
                           The point is that hatreds and prejudices are demon-inspired
                        and must be surrendered as any other sin. Christ does not say
                        that we should wait for years to rid the soul of these sins.
                        He offers victory over all evil now. "We should be careful not
                        to strengthen prejudices that ought to have died just as soon
                        as Christ redeemed the soul from the bondage of sin."—The

                          Although Jesus left the Jordan area to avoid unnecessary
                       controversy about baptism, He did not permit the existing
                       prejudices to keep Him from ministering to the Samaritans.
                       There were two routes from Judea to Galilee. The shorter one

                          The human ego is a formidable enemy. Its work is manifest
                       in all the conflicts of life. It is the guardian of self. It intrudes
                       itself into all the plans of God. It is critical and cold to others
                       unless others pay homage and bow at its feet with flattery and
                       praise. It demeans men and nullifies the urge to go and save

                           "We have no enemy without that we need to fear. Our great
                        conflict is with unconsecrated self. When we conquer self, we

                        every wall of partition. He came to show that His gift of
                        mercy and love is as unconfined as the air, the light, or the

                            It suits Satan's purpose to promote division among the
                         peoples of the earth. Out of division come contentions, hatreds,
                         racism, discrimination, oppression, suppression, exploitation,
                         and war. Satan hates a spirit of love and unity among church
                         members. Christ demands this very spirit; and when we are
                         truly converted, we are born into His family, and all in His
                         family are brethren. "Now are we the sons of God." 1 John 3:2.
                         "Honor all men. Love the brotherhood." 1 Peter 2:17. The
                         brotherhood of saints is bound by the mystical tie of divine
                         love which is stronger than the tie of blood relationship. Paul
                         said, "Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly
                         love; in honor preferring one another." Rom. 12:10.
                            "All ye are brethren," said Christ. Now read 1 John 3:14:
                         "We know that we have passed from death unto life, because
                         we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth
                         in death." See 1 Thess. 4:9.
                            What is a test of discipleship? John 13:35.

Equality of Believers     LESSON 11                                   ❑   Wednesday
                                                                            March 10

    UNEQUAL GIFTS       And there are differences of administrations, but the
      AND TALENTS       same Lord. And there are diversities of operations, but
       1 Cor. 12:4-6    it is the same God which worketh all in all."

                           We are all equal before God, but we may not all have equal
                        abilities. Man has no right to take honor to himself for gifts
                        that God or parents or environment have given him. His great-
                        ness or littleness is measured by God according to how he uses
                        and develops the talents given him. One who has only one
                        talent and uses it to the full for the glory of God is greater in
                        God's sight than one with many talents who does not use and
                        develop them in unselfish service. Our equality is based on
                        what we do with what we have. How we use the gifts we
                        have will affect •the difference of reward in heaven. The one
                        with only one talent in the parable was not cast out because
                        he had only one talent but because he did not use it properly.
                        See Rom. 12:3-8.
                           What is the source of all our abilities and possessions?
                        1 Chron. 29:14.


                           By what measure will we have to give account? Luke
                        12:48.


                           A serious mistake is made when one is lifted up in his own
                        sight by pride in things and talents which he might possess.
                        Pride in the heart always makes one feel exalted above his
                        brethren. Pride is an evil which God hates. It creates schism,
                        division. It hinders the fulfillment of Jesus' prayer for unity
                        among His people. Pride is sin. Pride is the food of selfishness.
                          From Christ's own words, what ideal is set before us?
                        Matt. 5:3.


 THINK IT THROUGH         What indictment of Laodicea would we do well to
                        ponder? Rev. 3:14-18.

     TUNITY—GREATER
       RESPONSIBILITY        All men are equal in God's sight. The differences in men's
            Rom. 15:1     lives have nothing to do with "inferior" and "superior" classes
                          of human beings. This whole fallacious concept has its roots
                          in evolution. The difference in men is often the difference in
                          opportunities—opportunities for light and, culture and posses-
                          sions, and above all for saving •truth. Those especially favored
                          are blessed of God and should take no personal pride for their
                          talents. Instead, a constant awareness that God is the "giver
                          of every good and perfect gift" should produce in them a
                          goodly humility and a real spirit of gratitude to •the heavenly
                          Father. It should also make them tenderhearted and pitiful
                          toward their less fortunate or more disadvantaged brethren.
                             No man chooses his place of birth, his parents, his race. How
                          foolish to hold him responsible for the disadvantages these
                          "accidents" may bring. Instead we must realize that in God's
                          sight all men are equal and that the poor about us, the dis-
                          advantaged peoples of earth, the heathen, and the wicked are
                          all a test of our character and stewardship. If it were not for
                          the grace of God, we might certainly be in worse state than
                          they.
                            For how much are we held accountable? Matt. 25:
                         21-27.



                             Will neglect of the poor and downtrodden be taken
                          lightly in the judgment? Matt. 25:45.



 THINK IT THROUGH           Is God pleased when we spend vast sums on personal
                         luxuries while the poor in our midst—even in our own
                         churches—suffer for want of necessities?

        CHRIST AND      though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor,
         THE LOWLY      that ye through His poverty might be rich."
          2 Cor. 8:9
                           Christ was and is the flawless example of unselfishness. Can
                        we approach His example? We must! See Philippians 2:5-8.
                           What condescension! Who can contemplate it ! The great
                        God of creation humbled Himself in order to save. His regard
                        for the lepers, the poor, the outcasts, the adulterers, the beg-
                        gars, the publicans, the Canaanite woman, the Roman cen-
                        turion, the hated Samaritans—all show us that He felt the
                        most lowly were worth saving. He would have come for any
                        one of these or anyone else. All men were equal in His sight,
                        and as soon as one was won to Himself, He elevated and
                        ennobled and declared that one to be His son. To His followers
                        He declared, "All ye are brethren."
                           "The common people heard Him gladly" because He was
                        empty of pride and arrogance and racism and self-importance.
                        He made all men feel wanted and worthwhile. When He gave
                        the great commission to His disciples, He ordered them to go
                        into all the world. He would not overlook a single country, or
                        region, or jungle, or desert. Into all the world! Win all men.
                        After Christ's ascension the conquest of the gospel over the
                        Gentile world began with the black man from Ethiopia, and
                        it spread across the world. It reached all classes and all kinds.
                        It proclaimed liberty and brotherhood. It lifted men! It de-
                        clared that in Christ there is neither "Jew nor Greek, bond nor
                        free." All are one.
                            The life of Christ becomes the life of the believer, and the
                        mind of Christ becomes the mind of the believer. He will
                        think and act as Jesus did, and humble himself as Jesus did.
                           What counsel did Christ give to those of high estate?
                         Matt. 23:11, 12.

                       is nothing less than the life of the only-begotten Son of God.
                       Let us all consider this. We may refuse .the invitations that
                       Christ sends to us; we may neglect His offer of pardon and
                       peace; but still it remains a fact that every one of us has been
                       bought with a price, even with the precious blood of the Son
                       of God."—Selected Messages, Bk. 1, p. 100.
                           Why did God pay such a price for sinners? John 3:16.



                           Because the Christian was bought at such a price, what
                        did Paul expect him to do? 1 Cor. 6:20.



                          Those purchased by the blood of Christ will glorify God by
                        working for the good of their fellowmen. They will daily ask,
                        "What shall I render unto the Lord for all His benefits toward
                        me?" Ps. 116:12.

                          "The revelation of His own glory in the form of humanity
                        will bring heaven so near to men that the beauty adorning the

                        dwells. Men will be captivated by the glory of an abiding

        BUT NOT OF
         THE WORLD       Throughout the history of man God has required that His
                       followers should maintain standards different from those of
          John 17:15
                       nonbelievers. This meant that in many instances the believer
                       had to disassociate himself from the activities of his neighbors.
                       People of the world often engage in some things with which
                       the Christian cannot and dare not associate himself.
                           What does the apostle Paul say should be our relation
                       to the world? 2 Cor. 6:17.




                           "The followers of Christ are to be separate from the world
                       in principles and interests, but they are not to isolate them-
                       selves from the world. The Saviour mingled constantly with
                       men, not to encourage them in anything that was not in ac-
                       cordance with God's will, but to uplift and ennoble them.
                       . . . So the Christian is to abide among men, that the savor
                       of divine love may be as •salt to preserve the world from cor-

                       Deut. 30:15, 19, 20.




                          "Those who follow the Lord are to be firm and straight-
                       forward in obeying His directions. Any deviation to follow
                       human devising or planning disqualifies them for being trust-
                       worthy. Even if they have to walk as did Enoch,—with God

     AMBASSADORS       God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead,
       FOR CHRIST      be ye reconciled to God."
        2 Cor. 5:20
                          An ambassador is sent to a foreign country. The people he
                       deals with are different from him. They have a different cul-
                       ture, different traditions, usually a different language and a
                       different way of life. The ambassador lives in this foreign
                       country and shares the life of the people there, but he is a
                       citizen of another country. So it is with the Christian. He lives
                       in the world, but he is not of the world; he is a citizen of
                       heaven. An ambassador speaks for his own country. People
                       listen to him to know what his country wants them to do.
                       The ambassador for Christ speaks for heaven. He wants to
                       have people think of Christ in the most favorable light. One
                       hasty action or impulsive word can spoil his representation of
                       his Saviour.

                       6:11, 12.




                          "Christ calls upon the members of His church to cherish the
                       true, genuine hope of the gospel. He points them upward, dis-
                       tinctly assuring them that the riches that endure are above,
                       not below. Their hope is in heaven, not on the earth. 'Seek ye
                       first the kingdom of God, and His righteousness,' He says;
                       `and all these things'—all that is essential for your good—
                       `shall be added unto you.'
                          "With many, the things of this world obscure the glorious

                       in the reforms for this time. All selfish methods in the service

                          The Christian will not be distracted into controversy that
                       will prevent him from doing his work as an ambassador of

                          God has outlined His most essential requirements for a full
                       spiritual life. These attributes will also guarantee real happi-
                       ness. They are not material things nor are they outward observ-
                       ances or forms. These virtues dwell in the surrendered, obedient
                       heart. True piety covers the whole range of human duty—to
                       God and to man.
                          To love mercy means to have compassion, to show sym-
                       pathy. To love mercy brings us nearer to God.

                           "The early Christian church was set on fire by Christ's
                        example. . . . In word and deed they showed that love was
                        their ruling principle. The heathen took notice, amazed at
                        Christian joy in doing for others. No pagan people had ever
                        produced a way of life equal to it. The Christian's love for
                        humanity was not only more voluminous but also more in-
                        tense. They seemed to forget themselves while helping their
                        fellowmen who needed them. Their love did not end with
                        solitary contemplation. It was a love of clothing the naked
                        and feeding the hungry."—Dimensions in Salvation, pages 279,

                       the law,—the principle that is illustrated in the story of the
                       Good Samaritan, and made manifest in the life of Jesus. His
                       character reveals that true significance of the law, and shows
                       what is meant by loving our neighbor as ourselves. . . . For
                       the spirit we manifest toward our brethren declares what is
                       our spirit toward God. The love of God in the heart is •the only

   Much has been said about the world population explosion in
recent times. The mission fields of the South Pacific are under-
going a different kind of explosion. Our baptisms are growing in
frequency and numbers. For every soul won in Australia and New
Zealand during the past ten years, two have been won in the nearby
islands designated as Australasia's mission territory. In the great
island of New Guinea alone more than 2,000 were baptized last
year.
    Our educational work is spiraling in the islands. Thousands of
young people, sensing as never before their need of education, are
pleading with our educators to admit them to our classrooms. Our
space is too small, and facilities too limited, to care for all who clamor
for a Christian education. In an endeavor to increase the effective-
ness of the mission program, the educational work must be given
greater emphasis, since it has been found that this program has
been responsible for the greater percentage of the baptisms over the
years.
    The first quarter's Thirteenth Sabbath Offering overflow for
1971 is allocated to the Coral Sea Union for two special projects:
(1) rebuilding and relocating the Central School of the Central
 Papuan Mission at Mount Diamond, a few miles from its present
location, and upgrading it to a high school, and (2) adding needed
 facilities in the way of buildings and equipment at the Omaura
 Bible Workers' School in the eastern highlands of New Guinea.

              Lessons for the Second Quarter of 1971
       Sabbath School members who have not received a senior
    "Lesson Quarterly" for the second quarter of 1971 will be
    helped by the following outline in studying for the first
    lesson. The title of the series is "Studies in the Epistle to the
    Ephesians." The title of the first lesson is "Challenging Truths
    for All Times." The memory verse is Ephesians 1:7.
       The outline is as follows: 1. Salutation of the Apostle
    Paul. Eph. 1:1-3. 2. Chosen for Salvation by God. Eph. 1:4-6.
    3. Redemption Through Christ's Blood. Eph. 1:7, 8. 4. Amaz-
    ing Plan Made Known. Eph. 1:9, 10. 5. Believer's Inheritance
    Secure. Eph. 1:11, 12. 6. Sealed With the Spirit of Promise.
    Eph. 1:13, 14.
