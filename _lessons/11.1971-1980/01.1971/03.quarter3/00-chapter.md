     The Blessing of Daily Study
    "Every day some portion of time should be appropriated
to the study of the lessons, not merely in learning to me-
chanically repeat the words, while the mind does not com-
prehend the meaning; but to go to the very foundation, and
become familiar with what is brought out in the lesson."
—Counsels on Sabbath School Work, page 53.




                     My Pledge
    As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge of
the Scriptures, I pledge myself to the careful and prayerful
study of some portion of my Sabbath School lesson each
day of the week.

                Woilild Mission
                   THIRD QUARTER, 1971

    Seventh-day Adventists, who owe their very existence to the divine call
to carry the "advent message to all the world," do well to restudy the Bibli-
cal and historical bases of our call and commitment, and to reexamine our
methods of carrying on mission work. This inquiry should help us catch
again the enthusiasm and spirit that motivated our early pioneers and their
successors upon whom the reality of a world mission challenge began to
dawn.
    These lessons are designed not only to develop new interest in world
witnessing, but also to show that every member of the church, regardless
of age, station in life, education, or race, is to be involved, in fact must be
involved, if the task is to be accomplished.
    Today, when many countries scattered around the globe are serving as
home bases for overseas missionaries, it is no longer correct to designate
"missions" as a branch of the church which is concerned with the evangeli-
zation of certain areas or racial groups. "Missions" is to be the immediate
concern of every member, and missionary work is to be carried out in one's
own household, neighborhood, and town as well as outside the borders
within which he was born. Although these lessons may emphasize the
"overseas" aspect of mission service, they are also intended to reawaken an
interest in the overall mission of the church and the purpose of our exis-
tence as a movement, whether such activity be carried on at home or
abroad. In these challenging and trying times, if we will take the opportunity
to do so, we may lift up our eyes "and look on the fields"; noting certainly
that "they are white already to harvest."

                           "Sin originated with him who, next to Christ, had been most
                        honored of God and was highest in power and glory among

                           "While claiming for himself perfect loyalty to God, he urged

                         desire of the angels that he occupy the position that Christ held.
                            "The evil continued to work until the spirit of disaffection

                       of Eve and that of Adam? 1 Tim. 2:14. Compare 2 Cor.
                       11:3.



 THINK IT THROUGH         In the light of the story of Genesis 3, think over these
                       questions:
                           1. What reasons can you think of for denying Adam
                       and Eve the privilege of eating of the tree of knowledge
                       of good and evil? Was it simply an arbitrary restriction?
                       Gen. 2:16, 17; 3:1-3.



                           2. What did the choice involve?
                            3. Had Adam and Eve been warned of Satan's inten-
                        tions?
                          "The angels warned them to be on their guard against the
                        devices of Satan, for his efforts to ensnare them would be
                        unwearied."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 53.
                           4. Would you classify the test as easy or hard?
                            5. Did Satan exercise creative power in the Garden
                        of Eden?
                           6. Why do you suppose Satan assumed or chose the
                        serpent as his medium? Wasn't that degrading himself?
                           "In order to accomplish his work unperceived, Satan chose
                        to employ as his medium the serpent—a disguise well adapted
                        for his purpose of deception. The serpent was then one of the
                        wisest and most beautiful creatures on the earth. It had wings,
                        and while flying through the air presented an appearance of
                        dazzling brightness, having the color and brilliancy of burnished

 MAN IN REBELLION       God."
                           "And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of
     Rom. 3:23; 8:10    sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness."

                          Man is responsible for the results of his own sin. He is
                        involved in the rebellion, and the outcome for him will depend
                        upon his choice.
                           How much was actually lost by the fall of man?




                           What warning has been given in regard to the insti-
                        gator of rebellion? 1 Peter 5:8.

                           Not only did man sin, but he became an enemy of God by
                        nature. And as long as men are at enmity with God, they are
                        also at enmity with one another. See The Desire of Ages, pages
                        302, 305.
                           When man was created, he was given dominion over this
                        earth. When man sinned, he forfeited this dominion, and it
                        was usurped by the deceiver.

A World in Revolt       LESSON 1                                          ❑ Friday
                                                                               July 2
              Part 6       "And having made peace through the blood of His
       RECONCILING      cross, by Him to reconcile all things unto Himself; by Him,
         THE WORLD      I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in
         UNTO GOD       heaven. And you, that were sometime alienated and
                        enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath
        Col. 1:20, 21   He reconciled."

                           The Old Testament word "atonement" meant a "covering";
                        that is, a covering in the sense of making things right. This
                        included the idea of bringing estranged persons into agreement
                        with each other.
                           "The term [atonement] appears in the NT but once and
                        only in the KJV (Rom. 5:11), where it describes the state
                        of reconciliation the sinner attains through the sacrifice and
                        priestly ministry of Christ."—SDA Bible Dictionary, page 92.
                          What did Christ come to this earth to accomplish?
                        Rom. 5:10.



                            We can now come to certain definite conclusions, as the
                         result of our study:
                            1. God planned to create this world and man.
                            2. A revolt in heaven, resulting in part from God's plans
                         to create this earth, made necessary Satan's expulsion.
                            3. Satan transferred his revolt to the Garden of Eden.
                            4. There Satan tempted Eve and Adam, and they forfeited
                         their rights and dominion by their own free choice.
                            5. This resulted in man's becoming an enemy of God, es-
                         tranged from God.
                            6. Our little world became the stage on which the contro-
                         versy would be worked out. Read 1 Cor. 4:9.
                            7. Man cannot disassociate himself from this struggle on
                         which his entire destiny depends.
                            8. Christ came to earth to reconcile man to God.
                            9. Man was involved in bringing sin and its curse upon this
                         world. Surely he has a vital interest in the outcome of the
                         controversy.
 THINK IT THROUGH           Who was it that initiated the plan for the reconcilia-
                         tion of men to God? Is man's reconciliation possible with-
                         out human involvement?

     THE EVERLASTING    having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that
              GOSPEL    dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred,
            Rev. 14:6   and tongue, and people."

                           In this symbolic vision, the angel represents God's messen-
                        gers who preach the everlasting gospel to every nation, kindred
                        (tribe), tongue, and people. The extent of the message and its
                        reception is seen not only in the commission to preach to all
                        nations and people, but also in the symbol of the area of
                        flight, "in the midst of heaven." This indicates that all men
                        everywhere will be aware of the final proclamation of the
                        everlasting gospel.
                            In what words does Isaiah describe prophetically the
                         universal spread of the gospel? Isa. 52:7, 10.


                            It is significant that in Revelation 14:6 the Bible links the
                         term "everlasting" with the word "gospel." Ever since the first
                         man sinned, the only means of redemption has been the salva-
                         tion provided by God Himself in the gift of Jesus Christ to
                         die the death that was ours that we might have the life that
                         is His. It will ever be so.
                            Set as they are in the Revelation prophecy, the "three an-
                         gels' messages" come as the final worldwide warning that pre-
                         pares the way for the second coming of Christ. The threefold
                         message includes appeals to respond to issues that revolve
                         around doctrinal truths. Yet any such response is meaningless
                         unless it is based on love for Christ and grateful acceptance of
                         Him as "the way, the truth, and the life." John 14:6.
 THINK IT THROUGH            Is it possible for those of us who have lived so long in

                        fusion. "All of God's people upon the earth are one body, from

                           How was a message similar to that of the first angel
                        presented to the Babylonian Empire in the days of Daniel?
                        Dan. 2:28-30; 4:24, 25; 5:22-28.


                           "By the captivity God purposed not only to bring Israel to
                        repentance but also to acquaint with the true religion the
                        Babylonians and other nations whom the Jews would meet
                        in their exile. Through such men as Daniel and Ezekiel, the
                        Babylonians were given the opportunity to know and to fol-
                        low Jehovah. Their failure to do this was a contributing factor
                        in their downfall."—SDA Bible Commentary, on Jer. 51:9.

                            How was Nebuchadnezzar given a message similar
                        to that of the second angel? Dan. 2:36-39, 47.


                           "Light direct from Heaven had been permitted to shine upon
                        King Nebuchadnezzar, and for a little time he was influenced
                        by the fear of God. But a few years of prosperity filled his
                        heart with pride, and he forgot his acknowledgment of the
                        living God. He resumed his idol worship with increased zeal

     IN A LATTER-DAY the cloud One sat like unto the Son of man, having on
            SETTING His head a golden crown, and in His hand a sharp sickle.
                      And another angel came out of the temple, crying with
                      a loud voice to Him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in Thy
                      sickle, and reap: for the time is come for Thee to reap;
                      for the harvest of the earth is ripe. And He that sat on
                      the cloud thrust in His sickle on the earth; and the earth
        Rev. 14:14-16 was reaped."

                           Following the proclamation of these messages a typical de-
                        scription of the second coming of Christ is presented, and that
                        is followed by the fourth angel of this chapter who is por-
                        trayed as reaping the harvest of the earth.
                           When is the harvest? Matt. 13:39.

                           The harvest portrayed in Rev. 14:15-20 is the final harvest
                        at the end of the world. Actually two harvests are presented
                        here which are prefigured in the two annual harvests in Pales-
                        tine, the grain harvest and the vintage. The grain harvest rep-
                        resents the gathering of the righteous. The gathering of the
                        "fully ripe" grapes which are cast into the winepress of the
                        wrath of God represents the gathering of the wicked for
                        destruction.
                           What blessing is pronounced upon those who die in
                        the faith of the three angels' messages? Rev. 14:13. Com-
                        pare Dan. 12:2.


                           This blessing may be pronounced on this group because
                        theirs is the privilege of being raised in the special resurrection
                        which precedes the general resurrection of the righteous.
                           "All who have died in the faith of the third angel's message
                        come forth from the tomb glorified, to hear God's covenant of

                                                                                July 7
            Part 4      "Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory
  THE FIRST ANGEL'S to Him; for the hour of His judgment is come: and worship
         MESSAGE Him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the
          Rev. 14:7 fountains of waters."

                          The three angels' messages are messages of hope. It is true
                       that they contain clear and sharp warnings to those who are
                       unprepared for Christ's return. But they are, most of all, voices
                       of certainty and eternal hope in the midst of our present con-
                       fusion, fear, and bewilderment. Seventh-day Adventists are
                       ever making an effort to preach these messages in their fullness.
                       They are not just another Christian sect or denomination. Our
                       church is made up of people who have, for the most part, come
                       from other religions and denominations into the belief that
                       only the messages of the three angels are adequate to meet the
                       challenge of the present state of our world and to prepare men
                       to meet their God.
                          The power of these messages, however, is not in the doc-
                       trines or truths they present to modern men but in the Christ
                       to whom these truths point.
                          What should be the primary stress in all our witness-
                       ing? Eph. 2:7-10.



                          To "fear God and give glory to Him" in this age when men
                       pride themselves in their own achievements and do not feel the
                       need of a Saviour, is to love, honor, and respect Him so much
                       that our lives will be dedicated to the one all-consuming pur-
                       pose of bringing glory and honor to Him.
                          "The hour of His judgment is come." The investigative
                       judgment in the heavenly sanctuary, which began in 1844, is
                       an awesome time of heart-searching and solemn responsibility
                       to ourselves and those about us; it is not a time of fear to
                       those whose lives are filled with love for Christ. Read 1 John
                       4:17-19.
                          The call to worship the Creator of heaven, earth, and water
                       is also extremely pertinent in this age when evolutionary as-
                       sumptions characterize nearly every field of learning and much
                       of what passes for theology.

  THINK IT THROUGH        What attests to the process of sanctification in the
                       lives of God's people? Ezek. 20:12, 20.
                          Are the three angels' messages merely part of our
                       doctrinal beliefs, or are they part of our lives? How do
                       they enable us to understand and reveal Christ better?

               Part 5    "And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon
         THE SECOND is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all
     ANGEL'S MESSAGE nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication."
            Rev. 14:8
                             Historically, the second angel's message followed the first
                         and "was first preached in the summer of 1844." But, just as
                         the first angel's message has not yet been given to the world
                         in all its fullness, so "not yet . . . can it be said that 'Babylon
                         is fallen, . . . because she made all nations drink of the wine
                         of the wrath of her fornication.' . . . The work of apostasy has
                         not yet reached its culmination."—The Great Controversy,
                         page 389.
                            Babylon, from its beginning, was symbolic of rebellion
                         against God and oppression of His people. Perhaps Satan's
                         greatest achievement is the introduction of "Babylon" into
                         the Christian church itself, and in this prophecy it is symbolic
                         of all apostate religions and individuals.
                            What did Jesus declare to indicate that there would
                         be "Babylonish" elements within the church, causing Him
                         to be misrepresented? Matt. 7:21-23.


                            Rev. 18:1-4 "points forward to a time when the announce-
                         ment of the fall of Babylon, as made by the second angel of
                         Rev. 14:8, is to be repeated, with the additional mention of
                         the corruptions which have been entering the various organiza-
                         tions that constitute Babylon, since that message was first
                         given."—Ibid., p. 603.
                            The "loud cry" of the third angel "has already begun in the
                         revelation of the righteousness of Christ, the sin-pardoning
                         Redeemer. This is the beginning of the light of the angel whose
                         glory shall fill the whole earth."—Ellen G. White Comments,

                            In Rev. 14:8 coercion by religious powers suggested in the
                         terms "made" and "all nations" indicates the universal extent
                         of apostasy. But, at the same time that apostasy becomes
                         worldwide, the righteousness of Christ is to be revealed in the
                         lives of His people as a "witness to all nations."

 THINK IT THROUGH           How long has it been since this message was first
                         given? How much longer must we wait for the call to
                         "come out of her"? Rev. 18:4.

          Rev. 14:9'
                           The test of the seventh-day Sabbath, which is a part of the
                       third angel's message, was carried to the world by many of
                       those who preached the first two messages of Rev. 14:6, 7.
                       Among these were Joseph Bates and James and Ellen White,
                       who in the mid-1840's began to keep the seventh-day Sabbath.
                       In the long years that have followed, Sabbath-keeping Advent-
                       ists have been carrying this great truth to the world. But the
                       time comes for it to be given with greatest power when the
                       attention of the whole world is focused upon this issue. See
                       The Great Controversy,. pages 604-606. This is still unfulfilled
                       prophecy, and Adventists clearly teach that no one yet has
                       received the "mark of the beast" mentioned in this prophecy.
                           But the time is soon coming when "the Sabbath will be the
                       great test of loyalty, for it is the point of truth especially con-
                        troverted. When the final test shall be brought to bear upon
                        men, then the line of distinction will be drawn between those
                        who serve God and those who serve Him not. While the ob-
                        servance of the false sabbath in compliance with the law of the
                        state, contrary to the fourth commandment, will be an avowal
                        of allegiance to a power that is in opposition to God, the keep-
                        ing of the true Sabbath, in obedience to God's law, is an evi-
                        dence of loyalty to the Creator. While one class, by accepting
                        the sign of submission to earthly powers, receive the mark of
                         the beast, the other, choosing the token of allegiance to divine
                        authority, receive the seal of God."—The Great Controversy,

        Acts 14:15-17
                           After the Fall the first of the great periods of crisis of which
                        we have a clear record is the time of Noah. Although Adam,
                        Abel, Enoch, and the other antediluvian patriarchs clearly have
                        a place in God's long line of witnesses, it is Noah's part in this
                        great world crisis that leads us to refer to him as one of earth's
                        first great missionaries. A tremendous challenge faced God's
                        missionary before the Flood. Large numbers of people needed
                        to be warned.
                          What was the basis of Noah's missionary preaching?
                        Heb. 11:7.

                           Noah's message was far more than a mere prophetic warn-
                        ing of judgment to come. It was a timely appeal to repent and
                         forsake sins. That salvation from sin was to be accomplished
                        through the death of Christ was portrayed in Noah's age in
                        the ritual of the sacrificial lamb. The author of Hebrews points
                        out that Noah was an "heir of the righteousness which is by
                        faith." Noah preached the everlasting gospel centered in a very
                        strong and urgent prophetic message of God's judgment soon
                        to come.
                            How did Noah demonstrate his faith before the skep-
                        tical world of his day? Gen. 6:13, 14, 22.

                          Noah's message and faith were vividly illustrated by a most
                        unusual visual aid—the ark. What a strange thing it must have
                        been to those antediluvians to see such a huge ship erected
                        on dry ground. Certainly, "Every blow struck upon the ark
                        was a witness to the people."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page
                        95. Few responded—but for 120 years Noah faithfully warned
                        the world of the day of judgment.
                           How is the blindness of Noah's generation with re-
                        spect to the approaching Flood described by Peter?
                        2 Peter 3:5, 6.

 THINK IT THROUGH          In the light of Luke 17:26, what parallels might be
                        drawn between the challenge of missions in our day and
                        that in the time of Noah?

         Heb. 11:8        "He [God] chose Abraham, of the line of Shem, and made
                       him the keeper of His law for future generations. Abraham
                       had grown up in the midst of superstition and heathenism.
                       Even his father's household, by whom the knowledge of God
                       had been preserved, were yielding to the seductive influences
                       surrounding them, and they 'served other gods' than Jehovah.

                          Abraham's hometown, Ur, has been extensively excavated
                       by archaeologists. That Abraham left a very advanced civili-

                       ing God's call to missionary service is demonstrated by the
                       following notable discoveries:
                          1. The houses were well-built and pleasant, in many respects
                       superior to most houses in this area today.
                          2. Sanitation was excellent. All houses were well drained and
                       connected to a covered sewer system.
                          3. An extensive school system was maintained. Children
                       were taught reading, writing, arithmetic, and geography.
                          4. Gold and silver artifacts, table service, weapons, tools, and
                       musical instruments all attest to a high state of civilization and
                       a high standard of cultural achievement.
                          Yet, when God called, Abraham unhesitatingly forsook
                       friends and security and set out for the unknown land of
                       Canaan; and, although blessed with wealth and a large number
                       of retainers, he lived in tents and moved from place to place
                       in the land of sojourn. In Palestine Abraham "exerted a telling
                       influence in favor of the true faith."—Ibid., p. 133, 134.
                           What inspired Abraham's missionary zeal? Heb.
                        11:8-10.

                        demonstrate during his years of service?

             Deut. 7:6
                        God had given the •Canaanites 400 years from the time of
                         Abraham to fill up their "cup of iniquity." Now He intended
                         that the strategically located area of Palestine become the
                         center of a missionary nation. Moses was commissioned to
                         lead Israel out of Egypt into the Promised Land, and the stop-
                         over at Sinai was ordained for Israel's mission orientation pro-

                         evident blessing upon them, they were to be witnesses to all
                         nations.
                            "Had the Israelites obeyed the instruction they received,
                         and profited by their advantages, they would have been the
                         world's object lesson of health and prosperity. If as a people
                         they had lived according to God's plan, they would have been
                         preserved from the diseases that afflicted other nations. Above
                         any other people they would have possessed physical strength
                         and vigor of intellect. They would have been the mightiest
                         nation on the earth."—The Ministry of Healing, page 283.
                            Deut. 7:14 adds, "Thou shalt be blessed above all people."
                         According to SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 4, pp. 27, 28, these
                         blessings were to include:

                           1. Holiness of character—Lev. 19:2.
                           2. The blessings of health—Ex. 15:26.

                           7. National greatness—Deut. 28:1.

The Morning of Missions        LESSON 3                              ❑ Wednesday
                                                                               July 14
              Part 4      "Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach
        JONAH, THE      unto it the preaching that I bid thee."
         RELUCTANT
                           Jonah was a "reluctant missionary," called •to preach the
        MISSIONARY      gospel to one of earth's most wicked cities. The Assyrians were
          Jonah 3:2     noted for their cruelty and vindictiveness. Jonah was intensely
                        nationalistic, and thus did not want to see Nineveh spared.
                        Jonah seems also to have been concerned that God might spare
                        Nineveh if the people repented; thus his predictions would not
                        come to pass. This would be humiliating to him. So, when he
                        carefully analyzed the whole situation, his decision was to go
                        as far away as possible in the opposite direction. Acting on
                        this decision, he purchased a ticket to Tarshish (probably in
                        Spain). But, through direct intervention by God, he ended up
                        being brought ashore closer to Nineveh than he was when he
                        boarded ship to try to flee from God's purpose.
                           Recognizing the inevitability of the divine purpose, he did
                        follow God's command at this juncture and preached the mes-
                        sage of God's impending judgment up and down the streets
                        of Nineveh, which was "an exceeding great city" (Jonah 3:3)
                        for its time.
                           How did Jonah react to his success as a missionary to
                        Nineveh? Jonah 4:1.


                           Jonah was not happy about being such a successful mission-
                        ary evangelist, but the •impression that God made •on his mind
                        through the object lesson of the gourd (Jonah 4:6-11) seems
                        to have done something to change Jonah's selfishness and his
                        hesitancy to place God's will first. At least he didn't hide the
                        facts of his disobedience and discouragement when later telling
                        the story—and this may have taken more courage than even
                        going •to cruel and sinful Nineveh with God's message of warn-
                        ing. Not all mission experiences are thrilling and bright, and
                        the modern missionary may take comfort that a man later
                        recognized by Christ as a true prophet of God (Matt. 12:39,
                        40) had his discouraging moments and even questioned the
                        wisdom of God's purpose.

 THINK IT THROUGH         Can we really blame Jonah for his attitude? What
                        would we do if asked by God to preach impending judg-
                        ment in a cruel enemy city?

          Isa. 56:6, 7
                            "Throughout his ministry Isaiah bore a plain testimony con-
                         cerning God's purpose for the heathen. Other prophets had
                         made mention of the divine plan, but their language was not
                         always understood. To Isaiah it was given to make very plain
                         to Judah the truth that among the Israel of God were to be

                         the flesh. This teaching was not in harmony with the theology
                         of his age, yet he fearlessly proclaimed the messages given him
                         of God and brought hope to many a longing heart reaching
                         out after the spiritual blessings promised to the seed of Abra-

                           How extensive was to be the world outreach of God's
                         people? Isa. 49:6, 12.




                            Isaiah's description of his vision inspired William Carey's
                         work for God. May 31, 1792, is recognized as the birth date
                         for modern missions. On that date Carey preached his famous
                         sermon from Isa. 54:2, 3, presenting the concepts that we
                         should "expect great things from God" and "attempt great
                         things for God."
                            The greatest days for missions are still before us. Read
                         Isaiah 60 and apply it to our day. When will it meet its greatest
                         fulfillment?


 THINK IT THROUGH            How will prophecies such as Isa. 60:1-3 meet their
                         fulfillment? What will happen in the church that will lead
                         to these accomplishments?

           Rom. 1:16
                         cal office. To many His life must have appeared a failure. He
                         was misunderstood by His own family and finally forsaken by
                         His friends. He had no home, no wife, no children, and, even
                         though He was a master carpenter, as far as we know He
                         possessed no furniture of His own. At the end of His first year
                         of ministry in the Judean district, He was forced to leave
                         under the threat that if He ever came back He would be killed.
                         At the end of His second year •of ministry in Galilee He was
                         rejected by His own people. During His last year of ministry
                         some of the despised Samaritans and Gentiles responded, but
                         at the end of that year He was betrayed by one of His disciples,
                         crucified, and buried in a borrowed •tomb.
                            Yet His life changed all history. How did this happen?
                            Men saw in His life a perfect example of what they might
                         become if wholly united to God as He was.
                            What reaction did the ministry of Jesus bring? John

                         characterized His life in spite of the storms of controversy that
                         blew about Him, they determined to find the secret of His
                         power and learn to live as He lived. Almost •two thousand years
                         later we are still amazed at the power of His exemplary life,

                        far as possible avoided all dealing with each other. To trade
                        with the Samaritans in case of necessity was indeed counted
                        lawful by the rabbis; but all social intercourse with them was
                        condemned. A Jew would not borrow from a Samaritan, nor
                        receive a kindness, not even a morsel of bread or a cup of
                        water. The disciples, in buying food, were acting in harmony

                        benefit them, did not enter into the thought of even Christ's

                           "Jesus had begun to break down the partition wall between
                        Jew and Gentile, and to preach salvation to the world. Though
                        He was a Jew, He mingled freely with the Samaritans, setting
                        at naught the Pharisaic customs of His nation. In face of their
                        prejudices He accepted the hospitality of this despised people.
                        He slept under their roofs, ate with them at their tables,—

       Matt. 15:28
                            The woman to whom Jesus addressed these words was a
                        Canaanite. "She was a heathen, and was therefore excluded

                        without hope of salvation. In dealing with her request Jesus
                        treated her "as the Jews would have done" (Ibid., page 400)
                        in an attempt to impress upon the Jews their indifference and
                        prejudice. Jesus had traveled the long distance to minister to
                        her need. He taught the disciples by this experience that those
                        they considered hopeless were to be included in the gospel
                        work and would respond to the gifts of His grace.
                            Our work is ".to minister to the despairing, and inspire hope
                        in the hopeless."—Ibid., p. 350.
                            What groups are often included in the "hopeless"? Often
                        it is the wealthy, the great and gifted men, the abnormal, the
                        outcast, the depraved, the stranger, the rebellious youth, and
                        those who have been disfellowshiped. We should realize that
                        their apparent "hopelessness" is God's opportunity. "Many
                        among the rich are longing for some divine assurance, some
                        spiritual hope. Many long for something that will bring to an

       John 10:16
                            Not only did Christ commission His disciples to preach the
                         gospel to every creature in all the world (Mark 16:15), but
                         He indicated that the end would not come until this mission
                         was accomplished. Matt. 24:14. It was clearly His purpose that
                         His church be a missionary church, involved in taking the
                         gospel everywhere.
                            His own ministry is an example of what His followeers were
                         to do. During His ministry Christ taught not only in Judea
                         and Galilee, but also in the following places:
                            1. Samaria—John 4.
                            2. Decapolis—Mark 5:1-20; 7:31.
                            3. Phoenicia—Matt. 15:21-28.
                            4. Caesarea Philippi—Mark 8:27.
                            Many of those considered "heathen" in these parts responded
                         favorably to Christ's ministry.
                            In the parable of the Good Shepherd, Jesus emphasized that
                         the sheep of God's fold are scattered everywhere and that the
                         time was coming when all His sheep, no matter where they
                         were, would hear His voice and come into His fold. As under-
                         shepherds of Christ, we must put forth self-denying efforts to
                         reach the lost sheep that they may hear His voice before the
                         black night comes when they will be eternally lost.

                         followers of Christ were gathered on the mountainside when
                         Christ repeated this commission to them. See The Desire of
                         Ages, page 818.
                             "Thus Christ gave His disciples their commission. He made
                         full provision for the prosecution of the work, and took upon
                         Himself the responsibility for its success. So long as they
                         obeyed His word, and worked in connection with Him, they
                         could not fail. Go to all nations, He bade them. Go to the
                         farthest part of the habitable globe, but know that My pres-
                         ence will be there. Labor in faith and confidence, for the time
                         will never come when I will forsake you.
                             "The Saviour's commission to the disciples included all the
                         believers. It includes all believers in Christ to the end of time.
                         . . . For this work the church was established, and all who
                         take upon themselves the sacred vows are thereby pledged to
                         be co-workers with Christ."—The Desire of Ages, page 822.
                            What does God, through the prophet Isaiah, say about
                         those who fulfill this commission, and what will be the
                         result of their labors? Isa. 52:7-10.

                             Ezek. 47:6-12 gives a picture of the work that God designed
                          to accomplish through ancient Israel. How can this same de-
                          scription be applied to the church of the first century?
                             "The church beheld converts flocking to her from all direc-
                          tions. Backsliders were reconverted. . . . Every Christian saw

                          interest prevailed; one subject of emulation swallowed up all
                          others. The ambition of the believers was to reveal the likeness
                          of Christ's character and to labor for the enlargement of His

           EFFORTS
        1 John 1:3          If tradition can be relied upon at all, every book in the
                        New Testament except James was written by a foreign mis-
                        sionary. It is commonly understood that Peter, Paul, Mark,
                        Luke, and John were foreign missionaries; but what about the
                        other New Testament workers?
                           'Matthew—Tradition assigns him to Parthia and Persia.
                            James—Probably the stepbrother of Jesus—possibly mar-

                           How widespread was the witness on the Day of Pente-
                        cost? Acts 2:9-11.




                           The language of the books of the New Testament is not the
                        Aramaic of Palestine, but the most-used language of the New
                        Testament world—Greek. The map of the early Christian world
                        reveals the apostles' widespread missionary journeys. All of
                        Christ's disciples accompanied Him on His foreign missionary
                        tours, and many of them later became foreign missionaries.
                        Besides those listed above, it is thought that Peter's brother,
                        Andrew, preached the gospel in Scythia and Thrace. Tradition
                        indicates that Nathanael (or Bartholomew) preached in Arabia
                        and possibly Ethiopia. Philip is said to have ministered in
                        Phrygia in Asia Minor. Simon is thought to have preached in
                        North Africa, and Thomas is considered to be the one who
                        carried the gospel to Persia and India.
                           Nicodemus became poor in this world's goods because he

        MISSIONARY
             VISION       While Peter was staying at Joppa, he was called by God
                       to take the gospel to the Roman centurion Cornelius in Caesa-
          Acts 10:34
                         rea. At that time Peter shared the reluctance of Christ's fol-
                         lowers to carry the gospel to the Gentiles. In order to help
                         Peter and his associates overcome the concept of exclusion,
                         God gave him a vision.
                             Read the vision as described in Acts 10:9-16.
                             Read about Peter's understanding of the vision in Acts
                         11:5-18.
                             "On hearing this account, the brethren were silenced. Con-
                         vinced that Peter's course was in direct fulfillment of the plan
                         of God, and that their prejudices and exclusiveness were utterly
                         contrary to the spirit of the gospel, they glorified God, saying,
                         'Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto
                         life.'
                             "Thus, without controversy, prejudice was broken down, the
                         exclusiveness established by the custom of ages was abandoned,
                         and the way was opened for the gospel to be proclaimed to the
                         Gentiles."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 142.
                           What mistake, in this respect, did Peter make later at
                         Antioch, and how was he rebuked? Gal. 2:11-21.


                            "Peter saw the error into which he had fallen, and imme-
                         diately set about repairing the evil that had been wrought, so
                         far as was in his power."—/bid., p. 198.
                            Peter ended his ministry as a foreign missionary in Rome,
                         being imprisoned there by Nero and martyred about the same
                         time as Paul. See John 21:18 and The Acts of the Apostles,
                         page 537.


 THINK IT THROUGH           In what way does Peter's vision at Joppa apply to the

       PATTERN FOR
        MISSIONARY          Christ's purpose for Paul's life of ministry among the Gen-
                        tiles was made clear to him through the following experiences:
            SERVICE         1. On the road to Damascus—Acts 26:15-18.
            Rom. 1:1        2. When his sight was restored by Ananias—Acts 22:12-16.
                           3. In a vision at Jerusalem—Acts 22:17-21.
                           How did Paul react to divine instructions? Acts 26:19.



                           At Antioch, "As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted,
                        the Holy Ghost said, Separate Me Barnabas and Saul for the
                        work whereunto I have called them." Acts 13:2. "Before being
                        sent forth as missionaries to the heathen world, these apostles
                        were solemnly dedicated to God by fasting and prayer and the
                        laying on of hands. Thus they were authorized by the church."
                        —The Acts of the Apostles, page 161.
                           Paul and his fellow laborers conducted three missionary
                        tours, each reaching out farther than the previous one. Paul's
                        missionary efforts were characterized by:
                           1. Training of young men, such as Timothy, for service.
                              The Acts of the Apostles, page 184.
                           2. Surrounding the churches he raised up with the "safe-

            JOHN'S to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on
        MISSIONARY His name."
          EMPHASIS
          John 1:12
                       Whereas Paul was the great itinerant missionary of the
                        early church, carrying the gospel to many unentered provinces,
                        John's missionary service seems to have consisted largely of
                        his pastorate of the Ephesus district.
                           Where did John work with Philip and Peter in mis-
                        sionary service? Acts 8:14.


                           How does this contrast with his former attitudes?
                        Luke 9:52-54.


                           John lived longer than did any of the other of the Twelve.
                        He became known for his confiding love and unselfish devotion.
                           "He was a powerful preacher, fervent, and deeply in ear-
                        nest. In beautiful language and with a musical voice he told of
                        the words and works of Christ, speaking in a way that im-
                        pressed the hearts of those who heard him. The simplicity of
                        his words, the sublime power of the truths he uttered, and the
                        fervor that characterized his teachings, gave him access to all
                        classes."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 546.
                           In the messages recorded in the book of Revelation, John's
                        ministry reaches out not only to the churches of Asia Minor
                        bat to all the world unto the end of time.
                           "When his voice could no longer testify to the One whom
                        he loved and served, the messages given him on that barren

     WITNESSING IN      and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not
          ALL AGES      their lives unto the death."
         Rev. 12:11
                          John had been given a vision of the entire great controversy
                       between Christ and Satan. He had seen all those who over-
                       came by Christ's victory on Calvary. He had also witnessed
                       the history of the first century of Christianity.
                           What threat hung over the early church? Acts 12:1, 2.



                           John himself had been cast into a cauldron of boiling oil
                        upon the orders of the Emperor Domitian, but his life had
                        been preserved. And even as he wrote the book of Revelation
                        he was suffering banishment on the barren and lonely isle of
                        Patmos. Here John was shown the church victorious and
                        triumphant in spite of the attacks of Satan and his agents
                        throughout its history.
                           "Centuries of fierce persecution followed the establishment
                        of the Christian church, but there were never wanting men
                        who counted the work of building God's temple dearer than
                        life itself."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 597.
                            Study carefully the great controversy as it has expanded
                        during the Christian era down to the time of the remnant or
                        last witnesses for Christ. Rev. 12:13-17.

 THINK IT THROUGH           Revelation 12:10 describes the victory of Christ over
                        Satan at the time when He cried out on Calvary, "It is
                        finished!" (See "The Desire of Ages," page 761.) Why
                        didn't God end the great controversy at that point in
                        time, since Satan's defeat was sure?

             SAVIOUR
            John 14:6    Revelation unfolds the ways and the will of God through
                         such forms as the Holy Spirit may choose. Yet it cannot be
                         separated from Jesus Christ "the way, the truth, and the life."
                         The ultimate purpose of revelation is man's salvation, and the
                         way of salvation is rigidly singular. Religion, culture, or life
                         itself apart from Jesus lacks eternal value.
                            How does salvation come to mankind? Acts 4:12.


                            "All the altars and sacrifices, the traditions and inventions
                         whereby men hope to earn salvation, are fallacies. . . . Christ
                         is the only sin bearer, the only sin offering."—Ellen G. White
                         Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 7, p. 913.
                             There are, of course, traces and reflections of truth in reli-
                         gious writings other than Christian, but here we are dealing
                         with the way salvation is provided. God has provided the only
                         way through the gift of Christ, and men can be saved only by
                         what He has done. Certainly there are those who have never
                         known Christ or taken His name upon their lips who will be
                         saved. But they will be saved only by what He has made
                         possible for them.
                             "Among the heathen are those who worship God igno-
                         rantly, those to whom the light is never brought by human
                         instrumentality, yet they will not perish. Though ignorant of
                         the written law of God, they have heard His voice speaking
                         to them in nature, and have done the things that the law
                         required. Their works are evidence that the Holy Spirit has
                         touched their hearts, and they are recognized as the children
                         of God."—The Desire of Ages, page 638.
                            Through what instrumentality does God speak to man-
                         kind? John 14:26.

                        of God for all men, in what perspective are we to view the
                        gospel commission?
                           Some will respond directly to the appeals of God by His
                        Spirit. But it is evident that God wills that this revelation be
                        conveyed by humanity in the preaching of the gospel.
                           We are our brother's keeper. The main channel through
                        which the revelation of God in Christ is to be preached to the
                        world is His church. Just as the child in a Christian home,
                        educated in a Christian school, may be said to have a better

                        Scripture or in nature may reach man in his depravity (with
                        all that the rebellion of the sinful heart implies) seems the
                        question posed in Romans 10.
                           Whom will God save? Rom. 10:13.



                           Knowledge of Christ requires a revelation, and the means
                        of this revelation is most often the preaching of the Word of
                        God. "So faith comes from what is heard, and what is heard
                        comes by the preaching of Christ." RSV. But some light
                        reaches even those who have not heard a specific preaching of
                        the gospel. Paul declares in a quotation from Psalm 19:4 (re-
                        ferring originally to revelation hi nature), "Their sound went
                        into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world."

                        in this respect of Mark 16:15, 16.)

           Zech. 4:6       We cannot do the work of Christ without the Spirit of
                         Christ. But this has been fully provided, as is attested by the
                         promises of Christ (John 14 to 16) and the outpouring of
                         the Holy Spirit on the early church at Pentecost (Acts 2).
                         That same power •is available now to all who are willing to
                         be used by the Holy Spirit.

                             How is the promise of the Spirit received? Gal. 3:14.

         John 14:12        "By this Christ did not mean that the disciples' work would
                        be of a more exalted character than His, but that it would
                        have greater extent."—The Desire of Ages, page 664.
                           Jesus did not have available the modern facilities of auto-
                        mobiles or airplanes which He might have utilized for the
                        spread of the gospel. In our world today with all these ad-

                        ourselves to be filled with divine power as He did.
                           "God did not design that His wonderful plan to redeem
                        men should achieve only insignificant results."—Ibid., p. 667.
                           Christ ascended to heaven on the resurrection morning, not
                        only to receive the assurance that His atonement for man had
                        been accepted, but to receive gifts for His church. See The De-

                          What did Christ make available at His ascension?
                        Matt. 28:18-20.




                            "His sacrifice in behalf of man was full and complete. The

                         which He came to this world had been accomplished. . . .
                         Clothed with boundless authority, He gave His commission to

           OF GOD
         Matt. 5:16         Christ is the source of this light. It is when He is fully
                         reflected in our lives that our works are recognized as "good."
                         Because men recognize 'that this kind of works must come from
                         a source other than the natural human heart, God is glorified
                         as the source rather than man.
                            This was the experience of the first Christians, who recog-
                         nized God's glory in the life and witness of Christ. John 1:14.
                             Whose glory was reflected in Christ and should be re-
                         flected in us? John 17:1-5, 22.



                            Through the glorious light of Christ seen in His followers
                         the world would be attracted to Him. This experience would
                         be shared by those who accepted, and thus the witness would
                         grow. John 17:20-23.
                            This light cannot be hidden. It just naturally shines out of
                         happy hearts dedicated to Christ and His service and becomes
                         the light of the world.

 THINK IT THROUGH            If the world lacks light, is it the fault of the world,
                         or is it because the church is not fulfilling its responsibility

                       Their hearts will throb in unison with the heart of Christ. The
                       same longing for souls that He has felt will be manifest in
                       them. Not all can fill the same place in the work, but there
                       is a place and a work for all."—Christ's Object Lessons, pages
                       300, 301.
                          This quotation points up the fact that missionary motivation
                       is based on more than the command of Christ as such. It is
                       also found in the desire and willingness of those whose hearts
                       "throb in unison with the heart of Christ" to accomplish in
                       their world that which Christ showed when He ministered to
                       the needs of a lost world. His was a great heart longing for the
                       souls of men, and those ,who have His heart transplanted in
                       them will have the same deep longing for souls that He had.
                           How did Paul rise above human weakness to fulfill
                        his commission? 1 Cor. 2:1-4.


                          Heeding Christ's command to serve as missionary in one's
                        neighborhood, hometown, or halfway around the world brings
                        no glory .to the individual. His is an inner compulsion that leads
                        him to go anywhere or be anything if only Christ's cause can
                        be advanced. 1 Cor. 9:16.
                           Toward what reward did the apostle Paul look?
                        1 Thess. 2:19, 20.


 THINK IT THROUGH          Is it possible to be a true follower of Christ and not

                         were here where we have been placed. It is true, of course,
                         that our love for Him leads us to want to accomplish His will
                         and His work, but this apparently is not what Paul had in
                         mind in this text. Christ's love in us reaches out to all man-
                         kind through us. It "constrains" us to give our all for our
                         fellowmen even as Christ gave His all when He personally
                         ministered to men.
                            This is the "treasure" that we have "in earthen vessels."
                         Therefore we do not credit ourselves with missionary achieve-
                         ments but recognize that it is Christ accomplishing His purpose
                         in us, "that the excellency of the power may be of God, and
                         not of us." "That the life also of Jesus might be made mani-
                         fest in our mortal flesh." 2 Cor. 4:7, 11.
                            What ministry has been committed to us? 2 Cor.
                         5:18-20.


                            This is accomplished by our allowing His mind to take over
                         our minds that our every impulse may be but the carrying out
                         of His will for us. Phil. 2:5.
                            What sense of urgency grips the faithful worker?
                         2 Cor. 6:1, 2.


 THINK IT THROUGH            What is the constraining, compelling influence in our
                         everyday lives? What is it that we want more than any-
                         thing else?

The Motive of Missions        LESSON 7                                   ❑ Thursday
                                                                            August 12
               Part 5     "And He gave some, apostles; and some, prophets;
     FOR THE REVIVAL and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;
      OF THE CHURCH for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the min-
                      istry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: till we all
                      come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of
                      the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure
         Eph. 4:11-13 of the stature of the fullness of Christ."

                             As God gives gifts to men, they in turn become the bearers
                         of these gifts to the church. All His gifts, then, are made pos-
                         sible .to enable His church better to accomplish the work given
                         it to do. Each was designed to lead the "body of Christ" to
                         a higher experience, to the "measure of the stature of the
                         fullness of Christ." Not simply a building up of the church
                         in numbers is envisioned, but a building up in the character
                         of its members. As the church uses its gifts to serve the world,
                         there is in turn a "perfecting of the saints."
                             Toward what achievement is the church constantly to
                         strive? 2 Thess. 1:11, 12.


                            It has often been stated that the working church is a
                         growing church and not a problem church, and that the best
                         way to revive the church is to put the members to work for
                         others. The law of the universe is that as we give we gain.
                         See The Desire of Ages, pages"20, 21. A giving church is a grow-
                         ing, gaining church.
                            The history of the Christian church demonstrates that the
                         periods of greatest strength and vitality have been those that
                         coincided with the greatest missionary effort. It is when this
                         wanes that the church is •in trouble. It might be difficult to
                         determine which is cause and which is effect. Perhaps it is more
                         accurate to see both as symptoms of the same basic disease

The Motive of Missions       LESSON 7                                      ❑ Friday
                                                                           August 13

                        its "first love" experience and bring a revival in the church,
          Eph. 4:15     but it will also bring about growth of individual Christian
                        character. In this text "speaking the truth in love" is clearly
                        connected with "growing up into Him." The truth is preached
                        in love—not so much by the words as by the lives of those
                        who are growing up into Christ. "As the tree strikes its roots
                        down into the soil for nourishment and moisture, so the
                        growing child of God reaches up to Christ for his vitality and
                        sustenance. Union with Christ is at once the cause and the
                        result of growth. He is .the head of each man as well as head
                        of the church."—SDA Bible Commentary, on Eph. 4:15.
                           What may the Christian expect as the result of unself-
                        ish service? 1 Thess. 3:12, 13.


                           Just as physical growth is dependent upon the use of our
                        muscles in exercise, so spiritual growth is dependent upon spir-
                        itual exercise, one manifestation of which is the sharing of our
                        faith with those who lack faith. The following texts emphasize
                        the importance of working for others in the development of
                        Christian experience:
                           1. A labor of love-1 Thess. 1-3.
                           2. Every man has a work—Mark 13:34.
                           3. The parable of the •talents—Matt. 25:14-30.

 THINK IT THROUGH          Is there so-called "missionary work" that can hinder
                        rather than help the Christian's spiritual development?

    Matt. 16:18, 19 in heaven."

                          We find the word "church" used only in two places in the
                       four Gospels, here in Matthew 16, and then again in Matthew
                       18:17. In both instances Jesus is speaking. He says that He
                       will "build" the church. Just what might that infer? Are we
                       to understand that the church is going through a sort of evolu-
                       tion, or does it mean expanding, growing, in organization and
                       methods as the needs indicate?
                           In the building of the church universal, what or who
                       is the foundation? Eph. 2:19-22.



                         What phases of spiritual work did Christ Himself
                       emphasize? Luke 7:22; 20:1. Compare Isa. 61:1-3.



                          "'Other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which
                       is Jesus Christ.' 1 Cor. 3:11. 'Upon this Rock,' said Jesus, 'I will
                       build My church.' In the presence of God, and all the heavenly
                       intelligences, in the presence of the unseen army of hell, Christ
                       founded His church upon the living Rock. That Rock is Him-
                       self,—His own body, for us broken and bruised. Against the
                       church built upon this foundation, the gates of hell shall not

        LAYING THE       ciples, He gave them power against unclean spirits, to
       FOUNDATION        cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all
                         manner of disease."
                            "These Twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them,
                         saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any
                         city of the Samaritans enter ye not: but go rather to the
                         lost sheep of the house of Israel."
                            "After these things the Lord appointed other seventy
     Matt. 10:1, 5, 6;   also, and sent them two and two before His face into
           Luke 10:1     every city and place, whither He Himself would come."

                             "When the Twelve were sent out on their first separate
                         mission, other disciples accompanied Jesus in His journey
                         through Galilee. Thus they had the privilege of intimate asso-
                         ciation with Him, and direct personal instruction. Now this
                         larger number also were to go forth on a separate mission. . . .
                         But the command to the Twelve, not to enter into any city of
                         the Gentiles or of the Samaritans, was not given to the Seventy.
                         . . . When the Seventy went forth in His name, they visited,
                         first of all, the cities of Samaria."—The Desire of Ages, page

                            What promise did Jesus make to His disciples regard-
                         ing their work as His representatives after He would
                         leave them? John 14:12.



                            What preparation did they need before they under-
                         took their global mission? Mark 16:15; Luke 24:49;
                         Acts 1:4.




 THINK IT THROUGH           Assuming that the Twelve Disciples, judged in the
                         light of their later leadership in the church, were qualified
                         and able men, how do you 'account for the restrictions

                Part 3      "And when the Day of Pentecost was fully come, they
                EARLY were all with one accord in one place."
         BEGINNINGS         "And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and
                         began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave
                         them utterance."
                            "And the same day there were added unto them about
                         three thousand souls."
                            "And the Lord added to the church daily such as
     Acts 2:1;4, 41, 47 should be saved."

                             As a fulfillment of Joel 2:28, 29 we have the mighty thrust
                          of a revival, the rapid growth of the early church, and a real
                          fulfillment of Christ's own words •in John 14:12.
                             From the record in Acts 2:8-11, would you suppose all the
                          3,000 converts of the Day of Pentecost to be local people?
                             Following this Pentecost experience and rapid expansion of
                          the early church, we find a continual growth until soon there
                          were "about five thousand men." Following this local growth,
                          we find opposition, and then persecution.
                             What gave rise to the election of deacons recorded in
                          Acts 6:1-7?


                              What reasons can you give for the tide of persecution
                          that came to the early church? Acts 8:1. Read "The Acts
                          of the Apostles," chapter 2.


                             It is most interesting to note that while persecution was
                          taking place in Jerusalem, Philip (one of the new deacons) was
                          conducting an evangelistic campaign in Samaria.

  THINK IT THROUGH          Thinking back on the Day of Pentecost:
                            1. Had the apostles perfected any new organization?
                            2. Did they employ any new methods?
                            3. Under what circumstances did God choose to pour
                         out His Spirit?

                          In •the instruction given to Ananias it is interesting to note
                       that the Lord revealed what was .to be Saul's work and mission

                          What reason can you assign why the church in Antioch

                        and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them
          Acts 13:2, 3 away."
                            Here at Antioch was a most active church, and this church
                         became the springboard for the notable missionary tours of
                         Paul and his companions.
                            No sooner were Saul and Barnabas ordained than they were
                         sent out, not primarily to the Jews, but to the Gentiles. They
                         had seen the results of Gentile evangelism in Antioch.
                            In the Pauline section of the Book of Acts we have mainly
                         the missionary activity of Paul and his associates. We must
                         never for a moment conclude that they were the only mission-
                         aries. All the disciples who lived long after Christ's ascension
                         became missionaries.
                            In the brief span of ten or eleven years, Paul planted the
                         gospel and established churches in Cyprus and at least four
                         provinces: Galatia, Macedonia, Achaia, and Asia. As far as we
                         know, the gospel had not penetrated into these provinces before
                         Paul came, except perhaps in Asia. (See Acts 2:9-11.)
                            Do you think that Paul followed his own planning in
                         his endeavor to penetrate these provinces with the gos-
                         pel? Acts 16:6, 7.

                            Later on Paul did work in Asia, but never in Bithynia. Can
                         we assign any reason for the difference? Some have surmised
                         that Bithynia belonged in the assigned •territory of another;
                         may it not have been instead that Paul was needed more some-
                         where else?
                            In writing to the church in Rome, what did Paul say
                         about his work in preaching? Rom. 15:19, 23.

 THINK IT THROUGH           1. Who were some of Paul's companions on his mis-
                        sionary journeys?
                           2. Why did it take so many years after Pentecost be-
                        fore the first missionaries were sent forth? (If Paul and
                        Barnabas were sent out about A.D. 48, then it could have
                        been seventeen or eighteen years after Pentecost.)
                           3. Why didn't the Protestant missionary movement
                        start until the close of the eighteenth century?
                           4. And why was it 1874 before the first Adventist

    AND METHODS              "Unto me . . . is this grace given, that I should preach
                         among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ."
                             "For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to
                         glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto
      1 Cor. 2:2; Eph.   me, if I preach not the gospel!"
     3:8; 1 Cor. 9:16;       "Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apos-
          2 Tim. 1:11    tle, and a teacher of the Gentiles."

                            We do not think of the New Testament as a thesis, a church
                         manual, or even a ministerial manual. However, we find that
                         Paul's letters were written first to churches he himself had a
                         part in establishing and second to fellow laborers and in one
                         case a convert. From the human standpoint we would say that
                         they were dealing with the problems that each faced as regards
                         doctrine, organization, membership in the church, relationship
                         one to another, apostasy and rebellion, and the future problems
                         that he foresaw the church would face. But in a wider sense
                         the Holy Spirit was speaking through him to Christians to
                         the end of time.

                            What gifts, or offices, did God bestow in the church?
                         1 Cor. 12:28; Eph. 4:11-13.



                            "God established His instrumentalities among a people who
                         recognize the laws of the divine government. . . . And He who
                         gives mental capabilities, and who entrusts talents to the men
                         and women who are His by creation and redemption, expects

                             Was there anything wrong in Cain's vocation that led
                          him into sin or caused his anger? Gen. 4:1-5.




                             Is there any element of ignorance on Cain's part?
                             On what basis would you question his motives? After all,
                          he did offer; he brought what he had and no doubt brought
                          some of the best. How did Cain know that God didn't accept
                          his offering?
                             What influenced Cain to do what he did and to take
                          such extreme measures? 1 John 3:12.




                             We have introduced this lesson with Abel because in a
                          sense he and his brother Cain represent the human race as a
                          whole. Sin had entered Eden. Our first parents had been ex-
                          cluded. The controversy between Christ and Satan had begun
                          in the hearts of men. The world's first two boys are prototypes
                          of all who have followed. There are the obedient and the dis-
                          obedient.
                             "The murder of Abel was the first example of the enmity that
                          God had declared would exist between the serpent and the
                          seed of the woman—between Satan and his subjects and
                          Christ and His followers."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 77.
                             "Abel grasped the great principles of redemption. He saw
                          himself a sinner. . . He brought the slain victim, the sacrificed
                          life, thus acknowledging the claims of the law that had been

          Heb. 11:7    by faith."

                          Genesis devotes more than four chapters to the story of
                       Noah. Gen. 5:28 to 9:29. In the New Testament God has en-
                       shrined Noah's name in His Hall of Fame (Heb. 11:7) with
                       other shining examples of righteousness by faith.
                          What New Testament evidence can we cite for the
                       historicity of Noah and the Flood? Matt. 24:37-39; Luke
                       3:36; 17:26, 27.

                          "Amid the prevailing corruption, Methuselah, Noah, and
                       many others labored to keep alive the knowledge of the true

                       to his children what God had shown him in regard to the
                       Flood, and Methuselah and his sons, who lived to hear the

                          "Noah and his family were not alone in fearing and obeying
                       God. But Noah was the most pious and holy of any upon the
                       earth, and was the one whose life God preserved to carry out
                       His will in building the ark and warning the world of their
                       coming doom. Methuselah, the grandfather of Noah, lived until
                       the very year of the Flood, and there were others who believed
                       the preaching of Noah, and aided him in building the ark, who

                            Remember this happened just over three years after the
                         crucifixion of Christ. What would we have done?
                            What was the occasion for the martyrdom of James?
                         Acts 12:1, 2.



                            Just why God permitted James to be beheaded, delivered
                         Peter miraculously (Acts 12:6-11), and struck Herod down
                         (verse 23), we do not know. This Herod (Agrippa I) was a
                         grandson of Herod the Great and a nephew of Herod Antipas
                         who had ordered the beheading of John the Baptist. He had
                         a son by the same name—Herod (Agrippa II)—whom we meet
                         in Acts 26 in the experience of Paul. Herod Agrippa I met his
                         death around A.D. 44. See SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 5, pp.

 THINK IT THROUGH         What in your thinking are the real reasons why this
                       enmity is generated against the remnant church? Isn't
                       the remnant church a fulfillment of prophecy? Why

Missions Misunderstood        LESSON 9                                      D Friday

                                                                            August 27
             Part 6        "If the world hate you, ye know that it hated Me
        INDIVIDUAL      before it hated you."
       PERSECUTION         "I have given them Thy word; and the world hath
                        hated them, because they are not of the world, even as
   John 15:18; 17:14    I am not of the world."

                           Earlier in our lesson, we discovered that the chosen people
                        of God at the time of Christ misunderstood aria actually- Nated

                            In our day what adds to the hatred of the enemy of
                         souls against the individual child of God? Rev. 12:12;
                         1 Peter 5:8.




                            We must ever keep in mind that the church is people, not
                         some abstract organization or thing. Satan's attacks against the
                         church will not be primarily to destroy the building as a
                         whole, (Eph. 2:19-22), to demolish the entire structure. He
                         will seek to loosen one stone here, to cause a crack there,
                         perhaps to weaken the mortar that holds the stones together.
                            "In this last meeting with His disciples, the great desire
                         which Christ expressed for them was that they might love one
                         another as He had loved them. . . . The command to love one
                         another had a new meaning in the light of His self-sacrifice....
                            "This love, manifested in the church, will surely stir the
                         wrath of Satan. Christ did not mark out for His disciples an
                         easy path. [John 15:18 quoted.] . . . The gospel is to be car-

                         677, 678.

 THINK IT THROUGH           Is it possible to be hated and yet respected for one's
                         conscientious convictions?

         IN THE OLD
         TESTAMENT         "Having sinned, man was sentenced to earn his livelihood
                        by the sweat of his face (Gen. 3:17-19), and .there was danger
             Ps. 24:1
                        that he would come to say in his heart, 'My power and the
                        might of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth' (Deut. 8:17),
                        whereas in reality it was God who had given him the power
                        to get it (Deut. 8:18). . . . By paying tithe man acknowledges
                        that he is a steward of God, the owner of all things.. . . Even
                        prior to the entrance of sin the danger of forgetfulness was
                        latent in man's character, and as a test God forbade man to
                        eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil (Gen. 2:17),
                        claiming it as His own."—SDA Bible Dictionary, pages 1102,
                        1103.
                          What is the earliest Biblical record of tithing, by
                        whom, to whom, and for what purpose? Gen. 14:18-20.


                          "The tithing system reaches back beyond the days of Moses.
                        Men were required to offer to God gifts for religious purposes,
                        before the definite system was given to Moses, even as far
                        back as the days of Adam. . . . This was continued through
                        successive generations, and was carried out by Abraham, who
                        gave tithes to Melchizedek, the priest of the most high God.
                        The same principle existed in the days of Job."—Ellen G. White

                           What provision did God make for the support of the
                        priesthood? Lev. 27:30; Num. 18:21.


                           Was the tithe all that God expected of Israel? Ps.
                        96:8, 9.


                           How did the last Old Testament prophet classify those
                        who do not pay an honest tithe or give offerings? Mal.
                        3:8-10.

         2 Cor. 8:9          Christ, the Son of God, became the Son of man, that we,
                          born sons of men, might become the sons of God. 1 John 3:1, 2.
                             We pause a moment to reflect on the motivation of Christ.
                          He didn't have to come to this world. We poor mortals think
                          so often in terms of "Do I have •to do this?" "Am I required
                          to do •that?" et cetera. Someone says, "But there is no New
                          Testament command to pay tithe!"
                             What did Christ say in regard to tithing? Matt. 23:23.




                             Christ states clearly that while there were weightier mat-
                          ters, tithing ought not •to be neglected.
                             "The rebuke of Christ to the Pharisees is applicable to those
                          who have lost from the heart their first love. A cold, legal
                          religion can never lead souls to Christ; for it is a loveless,
                          Christless religion. When fastings and prayers are practiced in
                          a self-justifying spirit, •they are abominable to God. . . . These
                          things call attention to the observer of rigorous duties, saying,
                          This man is entitled to heaven. But it is all a deception. Works
                          will not buy for us an entrance into heaven."—Ellen G. White
                          Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 5, p. 1098.
                             How did Christ tell one young man in His day to
                          become involved in practical Christianity? Matt. 19:16-22.

   STEWARDSHIP AS       the gospel should live of the gospel."
      PRACTICED BY
 THE EARLY CHURCH
                           The disciples were merely following the instruction given by
                        Christ when He sent out the Twelve early in His ministry:
         1 Cor. 9:14    "For the workman is worthy of his meat." Matt. 10:10. Luke
                        has it, "The laborer is worthy of his hire." Luke 10:7. The
                        Twelve were not to take along money, provisions, or extra
                        clothing; they were to expect to be entertained by the people
                        for whom they worked.
                           "The principle of tithe paying is also tacitly approved by the
                        writer of the book of Hebrews (see ch. 7:8)."—SDA Bible
                        Dictionary, page 1104.
                           In the epistles and letters of the New Testament, we find
                        two types of references to finance in connection with the
                        churches and/or ministry: first, the support of the ministry,
                        and second, collections for the relief .of the poor saints.
                           What reasoning does Paul use to justify not accepting
                        support from the Corinthian church in either tithe or offer-
                        ings? 1 Cor. 9:13-18.



                           "As a gospel minister, it was Paul's privilege to claim a sup-
                        port from those for whom he labored. But though he became
                        the servant of all, yet he worked with his hands to support
                        himself, that none might find occasion to charge him with
                        selfishness. He did not receive wages for his labor, though
                        as a minister of the gospel this was his right. Thus he made it
                        evident that he was working for souls, not for money."—Ellen
                        G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 6, p. 1088.
                           How does Paul indicate that he had received support
                        from churches other than the one at Corinth? 2 Cor.
                        11:8, 9.



                           There is reason to believe that members of the church at
                        Corinth were rather well-to-do. Perhaps Paul intended a slight
                        rebuke, that they had been somewhat negligent in entertaining
                        him. Evidently there were times when he had been in want.
 THINK IT THROUGH          What was the economic experience of the early church
                        in Jerusalem, as recorded in Acts 4:32-35? Why was it
                        necessary for God to give them the lesson of Ananias
                        and Sapphira?

                         the gospel? Rom. 1:14.




                            Paul refers in many places to his concern for the salvation
                         of the lost:
                           1. In thinking of his own kinsmen, the Jews, he could wish
                         that he himself were accursed, if by that means he might save
                         some. Rom. 9:2, 3 ; 10:1.
                            2. To the Gentiles he speaks about magnifying his office as
                         apostle if thus he might save some. Rom. 11:13, 14.
                            3. And again, he talks about being "all things to all men,
                         that I might by all means save some." 1 Cor. 9:22. Giving of
                         our means involves consecration and love for the cause, the
                         object of our giving. Paul was pleading with the Corinthian
                         members for a liberal offering for the saints in Jerusalem. And
                         in so doing he "laid no command upon the Corinthian brethren.
                         But he set before them the necessity of the church at Jerusa-
                         lem, and showed what others had given who had fewer advan-
                         tages and less ability than had the Corinthians. He presented

                            Examples are "Hidden Treasure" (Matt. 13:44) and "Pearl
                         of Great Price" (Matt. 13:45, 46).
                            Earlier in this lesson we read in 2 Cor. 4:7 that we are
                         stewards of the gospel, having "this treasure in earthen vessels."
                            Paul admonishes us to pray for the apostles (missionaries).
                         2 Thess. 3:1, 2.
                            Christ admonished His disciples to give freely because they
                         had received freely. Matt. 10:8.
                            Paul indicated that there must be "first a willing mind" in
                         giving. 2 Cor. 8:12.

 THINK IT THROUGH          What responsibility does the sending church have
                        toward the ones sent? 1 Cor. 9:7-14.
                           How many workers has your church given to the

      STEWARDSHIP
          1 Cor. 3:9
                     Not all Christian communions are universal in their scope
                       or vision, nor are they all evangelistic in outlook. The Advent-
                       ist concept stems from the gospel commission of Matt. 28:18-20
                       and from the three angels' messages of Revelation 14. The
                       angels of Revelation 14 are flying. This indicates the urgency
                       of the message which is to go to the entire world. The same
                       spirit that actuated Christ will possess the remnant church
                       as they become "laborers together with God."
                         What reward may the missionary expect both here
                       and hereafter? Mark 10:28-30.



                          According to what standard does God reward us?
                        Luke 6:38.



                           God is lavish in the way He bestows His blessings on us.
                        Is there reason to believe that He will not reward us in the
                        same way? See 1 Tim. 6:17.
                          What principle did Paul lay down in his letter to the
                        Corinthian church? 2 Cor. 9:6, 7.



                           What contrast did Jesus draw between the gifts of
                        the rich and that of the "poor widow"? Mark 12:42-44;
                        Luke 21:2-4.

   "But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar
people; that ye should show forth the praises of Him who hath called you out of
darkness into His marvelous light." 1 Peter 2:9.

             Part 1     "For as the body is one, and hath many members, and
CHURCH COMPARED all the members of that one body, being many, are one
     TO THE BODY body: so also is Christ. For by one Spirit are we all bap-
                    tized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles,
                    whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to
                    drink into one Spirit. For the body is not one member,
   1 Cor. 12:12-14. but many."

                            There can be no question from the context that Paul is talk-
                         ing about the church. In the first part of this twelfth chapter
                         he enumerates the gifts which God has placed in the church.
                         Then, after discussing the functioning of the spiritual body, he
                         makes it most plain in verse 28 that he is talking about the
                         church and the various talents which have been given to it.
                         In verse 27, after comparing the church and its various functions
                         to the human body, he specifically states, "Now, ye are the
                         body of Christ, and members in particular."
                            Who is the head of the body? Col. 1:18.


                           "Very close and sacred is the relation between Christ and
                         His church—He the bridegroom, and the church the bride; He

                            Now let us go back and call to mind some of the salient
                         thoughts in 1 Corinthians 12:
                            1. Verse 12. One body, not one for each country.
                            2. Verse 13. Baptized into one body.

                            5. Verses 22-24. Delicate, less honorable, uncomely, feeble
                               parts given extra protection.
                            6. Verse 25. Purpose of various functions to prevent schism
                               in the body.
                            7. Verse 25. Members protect (care) for one another.
                            8. Verse 26. If one member of the body suffers, all suffer.

                         keeping us together doctrinally as a church in all the

                       Eze. 23:2-4). The same figures appear in the NT ( 2 Cor. 11:2;
                       Eph. 5:25-32; Rev. 17:1-3). In Rev. 12 the woman represents

                          "The people of God, symbolized by a holy woman and her
                       children, were represented as greatly in the minority. In the
                       last days only a remnant still existed. Of these John speaks as

                          What symbol or relationship does Paul use to illustrate
                       the relationship of Christ and the church? 2 Cor. 11:2;

                           When we are born into God's family, God accepts us as His

                        to accept you and me as members of His remnant church.

                           Lest some might misunderstand, where did Paul say in
                        his letter to the Corinthians that these gifts of leadership
                        were placed? 1 Cor. 12:28.



                           According to the' above verses, the purpose of the church
                        can be summarized thus:
                           1. To train and organize and direct the members in their
                              work of ministry.
                           2. To perfect the saints spiritually as the church.
                           3. To bring the church into unity.
                           4. To establish the members doctrinally in Bible truth.
                           "The church was intended to take up, and fulfill, the work
                        that Israel failed to do—that of representing God's character

         Matt. 21:28
                           The chief priests and elders confront Christ with a question,
                        "By what authority doest Thou these things?" In reply, He
                        asks them a question about John's baptism, which really puts
                        His hearers on the horns of a dilemma. And then He tells them
                        two parables, each of which ends in a question.
                           The first of these parables is that of a man with two sons,
                        both of whom were told •to "go work today in my vineyard."
                        This parable is told only in the Gospel of Matthew, which
                        was written mainly for the Jews.
                           "The priests and rulers could not but give a correct answer
                        to Christ's question, and thus He obtained •their opinion in
                        favor of the first son. This son represented the publicans, those
                        who were despised and hated by the Pharisees... .
                           "The second son represented the leading men of the Jewish
                        nation. Some of the Pharisees had repented and received the
                        baptism of John; but the leaders would not acknowledge that
                        he came from God."—The Desire of Ages, page 595.
                           "The church is God's appointed agency for the salvation of
                        men. It was organized for service, and its mission is to carry

                           In the parable of the sower, Christ is represented as sowing
                       the good seed. Matt. 13:37. "The good seed are the children of
                       the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked
                       one." Verse 38.
                           "Christ's servants are grieved as they see true and false
                        believers mingled in the church. They long to do something
                       to cleanse the church. Like the servants of the householder,
                        they are ready to uproot the tares. But Christ says to them,
                        `Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the
                        wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harvest.' "
                        —Christ's Object Lessons, page 71.
                           No one will deny that the church itself is, in a sense, a mis-
                       sion field. When Jesus sent forth the Twelve, He sent them
                        "to the lost sheep of the house of Israel." Matt. 10:6. Should
                        the larger mission outreach be delayed until the church is
                        purged? Should some members be delegated to home missions
                        while others go to lands afar? Do you think that modern
                        methods of travel and communication have some part in God's
                        plan for the timing of His worldwide message?
                           What were Christ's last words to His disciples just
                        before His ascension? Acts 1:8 Compare Luke 24:47, 48.

      Mark 10:29, 30    secutions; and in the world to come eternal life."

                            We have this same thought expressed in Matthew 19:29 and
                        in Luke 18:29, 30, but Mark remains the most detailed and
                        inclusive.
                            What we have brought to mind in all three references are
                        the results to the individual of forsaking the world for the
                        things of God.
                            "But Peter's question, 'What shall we have therefore?'
                        [Matt. 19:27] had revealed a spirit that uncorrected would
                        unfit the disciples to be messengers for Christ; for it was the
                        spirit of a hireling. . . . Lest the disciples should lose sight of
                        the principles of the gospel, Christ related to them a parable
                        illustrating the manner in which God deals with His servants,
                        and the spirit in which He desires them to labor for Him.
                        . . . Not the amount of labor performed or its visible results
                        but the spirit in which the work is done makes it of value with
                        God."—Christ's Object Lessons, pages 396, 397.
                            Is there joy and pleasure in merely sowing the gospel seed?
                        Need we worry about the harvest? Are we guaranteed a har-
                        vest?
                            "While the great final reward is given at Christ's coming,
                        truehearted service for God brings a reward, even in this life.

                            In addition to the joys and pleasures of cooperating
                         with God here and now, what can the worker for God
                         look forward to? 1 Thess. 2:19, 20. Compare Matt.
                         25:21, 23.


                            Paul refers here to his converts won and souls saved as his
                         real joy at the coming of Christ.

 THINK IT THROUGH          Do you think it is wrong to work for a reward? See
                         Heb. 11:26.
                           Is it enough just to warn people? Or is something

                            Think on these things:
                            1. The church is the household of God. 1 Tim. 3:15.
                            2. Prophets and apostles laid the foundation.
                            3. Christ is the Chief Cornerstone that "holds together the
                        various parts of the spiritual house, giving shape and unity to
                        it."—SDA Bible Commentary, on Eph. 2:20.
                            "In the quarry of the Jewish and the Gentile world the
                        apostles labored, bringing out stones to lay upon the foun-

                         [Eph. 2:19-22 quoted]. And to the Corinthians he wrote:
                         [1 Cor. 3:10-13 quoted]. The apostles built upon a sure founda-

                        drance did the builders labor. Their work was made exceedingly
                        difficult by the opposition of the enemies of Christ."—The Acts
                        of the Apostles, page 596.
                            Notice Peter's description of the same spiritual building.
                        1 Peter 2:5-8. How many similarities do you find here to what
                        Paul wrote to the Ephesians? If every Christian becomes in
                        a sense a priest, must he have an offering? Heb. 8:3. Compare
                        Rev. 20 : 6.
                            This figure of speech by which individual church members
                        are thought of as being parts of a building occurs also in Ps.

    FOR HIS TEMPLE
          John 2:17 This is not the first time that Jesus entered the temple.
                       Thirty years earlier He had been brought here as a babe, to be
                       presented as a firstborn son. Luke 2:22-24. At the age of
                       twelve He had accompanied His parents to the Passover
                       Feast, at which time we have His first recorded words: "Wist
                       ye not that I must be about My Father's business?" Luke 2:49.
                          "As His mission had opened to Jesus in the temple, He
                       shrank from contact with the multitude. He wished to return
                       from Jerusalem in quietness, with those who knew the secret

                          Paul caught the vision and accepted the 911. Later, leaders
                       of the church in Antioch (Acts 13:2) were directed by the
                       Holy Spirit to ordain Paul and Barnabas for the work to
                       which they had been called.

                          "In John's day Ephesus was the leading city of the Roman
                       province of Asia, and later was its capital. . . . Christianity
                       appears to have been preached there first about A.D. 52, by
                       Paul, when he stopped for a short time while homeward
                       bound to Jerusalem and Antioch from his Second Missionary

                    "The woman" here represents the true church at the time
                        of the Protestant Reformation. After centuries of persecution,
                        relief came to her a little while before "the remnant of her
                        seed" appeared on the stage of action (verse 17) toward the
                        close of time.
                           Which prophetic period especially speaks of oppres-

                           Why did the Protestant churches not awaken to their
                        responsibility in foreign missions before the end of the
                        eighteenth century?


                            "The Reformers evidenced no concern for overseas missions
                        to non-Christians. Indeed, three centuries elapsed before Prot-
                        estantism at large even began such outreach. Why?"—W. R.

                            "One searches in vain in the works of Martin Luther for
                        any exposition of Matthew 28:19, 20 or Mark 16:15 that would
                        hint at the church's responsibility to move beyond Christendom.

                            During the three centuries that followed the Protestant
                        Reformation, a number of independent churches arose in Europe
                        and spread to other lands. During these three centuries a few
                        Protestant groups conducted missionary endeavors, notably
                        the Moravians and certain Pietistic groups. The first mission
                        societies were organized by volunteer groups, people interested
                        in foreign missions, and some of them were nondenominational.
                        None of the churches, as churches, took an interest in missions.

 THINK IT. THROUGH         What led to the rapid spread of missions once the
                        program got started?

                       and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear

                       is come: and worship Him that made heaven, and earth,
                       and the sea, and the fountains of waters. And there
                       followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is
                       fallen, that great city, because she made all nations
                       drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication. And
                       the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice,
                       If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive
                       his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall
                       drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured
                       out without mixture into the cup of His indignation; and
                       he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the
                       presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the
         Rev. 14:6-10 Lamb."

                           "At times during the early days of the message, Seventh-day
                        Adventists caught glimpses of a broadening work that would
                        eventually embrace many nationalities. Not until the early
                        70's, however, did the leaders in the advent movement begin
                        to comprehend that theirs was a mission to the whole world.
                        Even as late as in 1872, the scripture, 'This gospel of the king-
                        dom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all
                        nations; and then shall the end come,' was regarded simply
                        as a 'prominent sign of the last day,' meeting fulfillment in the
                        extension of Protestant missions. . . . But in 1873 a marked
                        change of sentiment began to appear in the utterances of leaders
                        among Seventh-day Adventists regarding their duty to warn
                        the world."—Life Sketches, footnote, page 203.
                           What providential leading of the Spirit of God did
                         Paul have on his missionary journeys? Acts 16:6, 9.




                           At one time the Spirit of God restrained Paul from entering
                        a certain country and guided him to Macedonia instead. In
                        our time the Holy Spirit led the Advent people to establish
                        foreign missions.

 THINK IT THROUGH          The Lord used Christians of other faiths and other
                        nationalities to lay the foundation for a strong foreign
                        mission work when the time came for the third angel's
                        message to be given to the world.

                        with His purpose for them, and who look for His promised
                        return. This invitation to all men everywhere will culminate
                        in the call of the mighty angel of Rev. 18:1-4, summoning those
                        who choose to obey God rather than to follow human traditions
                        to unite with God's remnant people.

                             The word translated into English as "power" is the same
                         one from which our word "dynamite" is derived. The gospel
                         is the dynamic power of God to save men. It is the good news
                         about God and His infinite purpose.

                            "Power of God. The gospel is the way in which God exerts
                         His power for the salvation of men. Wherever the gospel finds

                         to man's redemption are removed."—SDA Bible Commentary,

                        the apostle John wrote a generation later that they had left
                        their first love. Rev. 2:4.
                          After reminding the Ephesians that they had been
                        "made alive" by the love and grace of God, how did
                        Paul describe their present state? Eph. 2:4-6. What had
                        made the transformation in their lives? Eph. 1:13.



                          Men, physically dead, cannot restore themselves to life. Nor
                        can men who are spiritually dead. The power to impart life
                        must come from outside themselves.
                          "Miracles can be wrought through the Word; for it is profit-

                           In writing to the Corinthians, what picture did Paul

                           Paul reminds the Corinthians, persons whom he says are

                        he indicates that God's gift of justification and His promise
                        of sanctification had given them a wholly new outlook. See
                        2 Cor. 5:17-20; 6:1 for the responsibility resting on one who

                          of his day ; or to Abraham, when God promised that his seed

                             What facilities do we have in our day that Paul and the

                          did not have one hundred years ago? Are we making the best

                             Christ never told His disciples to pray for the harvest. God

        John 10:16
                           There is no more reason to think that there may be several
                       folds or several flocks than to rationalize that there must be
                       more than one Shepherd. In every instance, Christ spoke in
                       the singular.
                           The apostolic church thought in terms of one church (1 Cor.
                       12:12, 13, 25, 27), one faith (Eph. 4:13), one baptism (Eph.
                       4:4-6)—not a divided church or a divided Christ. •Christ loved
                       the church, not churches (Eph. 5:25-27), which He earnestly
                       desires •to cleanse and purify so "that He might present it to
                       Himself a glorious church."
                           When the Adventist pioneers considered organizing the
                       church, they thought in terms of one church, as they did of
                       one message. Today the organization has grown into missions,
                       conferences, unions, and divisions of the one church the world
                       around. In this respect Seventh-day Adventists stand out as
                       unique in the Protestant world. In striking contrast, with China
                       as an example, in the book The Communist Church in China,
                       Francis Price Jones describes the religious situation there in
                       1949: There were some fifteen or twenty separate Lutheran
                       mission boards at work, eight different Methodist mission
                       boards, three from Britain, four from the United States, and
                        one from Canada.
                           In varying degrees the same might be said of many another
                        country. As a result, sixty years ago Protestant mission boards
                        inaugurated what was called the "comity" plan, of dividing up
                        each country among the boards already operating there. But in
                        all the world there is only one Seventh-day Adventist Church.
                        This church functions on the basis that it has a distinctive judg-

                       in Him became its subjects. . . . But, as Jesus Himself made
                       clear, this kingdom of grace was preparatory to the kingdom
                       of glory."—Ibid., on Matt. 4:17.
                          "Hand in hand with foreign missions have gone the trans-
                       lation and circulation of the Scriptures. Whereas the first 18
                       centuries of the Christian Era saw the Bible translated into
                       only 71 languages, the next century—the 19th—saw the total
                       climb to 567. By the middle of the 20th century the number
                       had grown to over 1,000. [And today, that number has swelled
                       to over 1,400]. There are but few people in the world today
                       who do not have access to at least some part of Scriptures in
                       their own tongue."—Ibid., on Matt. 24:14.
                          "Christ ascended to heaven and sent His Holy Spirit to give
                       power to the work of His disciples. Thousands were converted
                       in a day. In a single generation the gospel was carried to every
                       nation under heaven."—Testimonies, Vol. 8, p. 26.
                          As human beings we are prone to want to speculate and
                       figure. From the human point of view we may say that it
                       has taken so many years for the church to reach its present
                       position, and that it will take us so many more years to warn
                       the whole world. People are being born faster than we can
                       reach them. Obviously, to complete the task will take a miracle
                       of God's power.
                         What did Paul say about the work of God in the earth?
                       Rom. 9:28.



                          How will God "finish His work" and conclude the task
                       of warning the world? Read Joel 2:1, 28-32; Rev. 10:7;
                       18:1.

           Rev. 7:9     hands."

                           There may be different views concerning the relationship of
                        the great multitude to the 144,000 presented in the first part
                        of chapter 7 as having been sealed. Suffice it to say that here
                        we have pictured the redeemed from all the earth, the trium-

                           In Rev. 14:3 the 144,000 are pictured again, while in the
                        fifteenth chapter (verses 2, 3) we find the great multitude of
                        redeemed saints.
                           What is the difference between the two groups as to
                              (a) their experience,

                        and sacrifice? He saw the results of the travail of His soul and
                        was satisfied. Looking into eternity, He beheld the happiness
                        of those who through His humiliation had received pardon and
                        everlasting life. •His ear caught the shout of the redeemed. He
                        heard the ransomed ones singing the song of Moses and the

       Thirteenth Sabbath Overflow Offering

     SEPTEMBER 25, 1971        •     TRANS-AFRICA DIVISION

   The Congo and Central African Unions, which are French-
speaking areas, comprise nearly one half the membership of the
Trans-Africa Division. These unions include the countries of
Rwanda, Burundi, and the Congo, to which our Thirteenth Sab-
bath Overflow Offering goes. The specific projects are (1) a class-
room and administration building at Kivu Adventist Seminary,
Congo; (2) an administration building, including a library and
laboratory, for the Gitwe College in Rwanda.
    After years of trouble and war, stability and peace have now
come to the Congo. This country, four times the size of the state of
Texas or the country of France, offers great potential and promise
for our work. Tribalism is gradually eroding. The prejudice and
opposition which made our work difficult in past years have all but
disappeared under the existing government.
    The word missionary is still magic in this country, for great re-
pect and appreciation are shown the missionary who has left his
homeland to help these people in their need. Be assured, however,
 that our national believers do not sit back in indolence, expecting
 the work of spreading the gospel to be done by the missionaries
 alone. They work together as an effective team.
    You may not have been to the Congo, Rwanda, or Burundi. But
 you know their people: They are the same as you; they want to
 learn; they want to be of help to others—to be ready to meet Christ.
    You are both alike—except they need an opportunity.
