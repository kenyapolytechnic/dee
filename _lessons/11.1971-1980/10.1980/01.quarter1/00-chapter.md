)FFICE OF THE PRESIDENT




       Dear Fellow Sabbath School Members:

       Few things express so eloquently the cohesiveness of the world Seventh-
       day Adventist family as the traditional 13th Sabbath Special Projects
       Offering. More than a half million Sabbath School members in the Inter-
       American Division in grateful expectancy look to the world family for
       another display of Christian generosity through the 13th Sabbath Special
       Projects Offering for the first quarter of 1980. Adventist believers
       throughout Inter-America are confident that on this special date there
       will be another outpouring of sacrificial love by Seventh-day Adventists
       around the world.

       The priority need for which the 13th Sabbath Special Projects Offering
       will be dedicated, is the completion of the Medical Center at Montemore-
       los University, in Mexico. This medical center, when completed, will
       provide much needed, practical on-the-job medical missionary training
       for medical students, nurses and ministerial students attending the uni-
       versity. The center will coordinate public health activities in a series
       of satellite clinics strategically located throughout the region of Nuevo
       Leon. These facilities will put into practice the medical missionary
       principles of the One who "went about doing good, and healing those that
       were oppressed."

       Throughout the Inter-American Division territory are scores of 13th Sab-
       bith projects that stand as mute, yet eloquent, monuments to the gener-
       osity of the world fraternity of Sabbath School members. These projects
       of the past are continuing to fulfill the divine commission of proclaim-
       ing the Advent message. As we look to March 29, 1980, we confidently
       say, "Thank you" in advance for making this 13th Sabbath Special Projects
       Offering the greatest and most important in our history. We crave your
       prayers, gifts and moral support, as together we seek to enlarge the
       Kingdom of God on earth, and hasten the return of our soon-coming Lord.

       Sincerely yours in Christian service,



       B. L. Archbold
       President

                 REDEMPTION IN ROMANS
                                       Introduction

   This quarter is devoted to the study of the book of Romans. In book study the
student concentrates on a particular book to discover what God is trying to teach in
that book. There is a reason God guided the church in including in the canon each of
the 66 books that are in the Bible, and this reason needs to be discovered.
   In true book study the student does not begin with a particular topic and then study
what the book says about that topic. He carefully examines chapter after chapter to
understand the basic theme that the inspired author has developed. This is called the
inductive method of Bible study. It is one of the most fruitful methods of study
because it examines all that is said in a particular book, and every part is examined in
the context of the whole.
   In our study of the book of Romans we will have to pass over rapidly certain
sections of the book, because one quarter is too brief a time to study all the book's
details. Despite this restriction, every effort has been made to present God's basic
message in the book. Students who have the time and the inclination can undertake a
more thorough study. They will be richly rewarded. The fact that we named the
lessons "Redemption in Romans" is not intended to restrict the inductive study of the
book in any way.
   There is one rule of Bible study that is basic, especially in book study. This rule can
be variously stated, but following is a simple form of it: In the study of the Bible one
must seek to discover what the words of Scripture were designed to mean to those to
whom they were first addressed; after that, what they mean for us today. This does not
mean that what the Scriptures meant and what they mean in any given passage is
necessarily different. But historical circumstances change. Seventh-day Adventists
are fortunate to have the spirit of prophecy to apply the message of Scripture to our
age.
   Commenting on the Sermon on the Mount, Ellen White encourages the use of this
rule in this way:
   "Let us in imagination go back to that scene, and, as we sit with the disciples on the
mountainside, enter into the thoughts and feelings that filled their hearts. Under-
standing what the words of Jesus meant to those who heard them, we may discern in
them a new vividness and beauty, and may also gather for ourselves their deeper
 lessons."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 1.
   Applied to the book of Romans, this rule means that we must discover first what the
 words of Paul meant to the Roman Christians. Paul had a particular reason for writing
 to the Roman congregation. There were certain issues he wished to clarify. These we
 must understand. But Paul did not write the letter merely for the benefit of the Roman
 Christians. Ellen White wrote:
    "He hoped that other churches also might be helped by the instruction sent to the
 Christians at Rome; but how dimly could he foresee the far-reaching influence of his
 words! Through all the ages the great truth of justification by faith has stood as a
 mighty beacon to guide repentant sinners into the way of life. It was this light that
 scattered the darkness which enveloped Luther's mind and revealed to him the
 power of the blood of Christ to cleanse from sin. The same light has guided
 thousands of sin-burdened souls to the true Source of pardon and peace. For the
 epistle to the church at Rome, every Christian has reason to thank God."—The Acts of
 the Apostles, pp. 373, 374.

                      "I commend unto you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of
                    the church which is at Cenchrea: that ye receive her in the
                    Lord, as becometh saints, and that ye assist her in what-
                    soever business she hath need of you: for she hath been a
                    succourer of many, and of myself also" (Rom. 16:1, 2).

                        Cenchreae was the eastern port of Corinth. Phoebe was a
                     deaconess (Gr. diakonos) of the church of Cenchreae. She was
                     probably the bearer of the letter to Rome. At any rate, she was
                     traveling to Rome, and Paul wished to introduce her to the
                     believers there. Paul's mention of Phoebe, a resident of greater
                     Corinth, establishes Corinth as the city of origin of Paul's letter
                     to the Romans.
                       One of the purposes of establishing the city of origin of the
                     New Testament epistles is to ascertain the date of writing. Since
                     Paul traveled much, knowing where he was at a particular time
                     gives us a clue as to the date. In our next lesson we shall
                     establish the date of his visit to Corinth during which he wrote
                     the Roman letter.

                       The mention of what other Christians provides evidence
                     that Corinth was the city of origin? Rom. 16:23; 1 Cor. 1:14;
                     2 Tim. 4:20.

                        Gaius was one of the converts Paul had baptized in Corinth,
                     and of Erastus it is said that he "abode at Corinth."
                        "A paving block found near the large theater of Corinth con-
                     tains an inscription stating that 'Erastus in return for the aed ile-
                     ship laid (the pavement) at his own expense.' . . . The liberal
                     Erastus of the inscription may be the convert of Paul mentioned
                     in Rom 16:23. . . . Paul informed Timothy in his last letter,
                     shortly before his death, that Erastus had stayed behind in
                     Corinth (2 Ti 4:20). If the .. . texts refer to the same individual,
                     and he is identical with the Erastus mentioned in the inscrip-
                     tions, then Erastus, a commissioner of streets and buildings at
                     Corinth, had become one of Paul's converts.. . . However, the
                     possibility that Paul refers to more than one Erastus should not
                     be ruled out."—S.D.A. Bible Dictionary, p. 321.
                        The style of ancient letters was not like that of modern letters
                     which give the address of the point of origin at the beginning. In
                     the case of the letter to the Romans the place of writing is
                     learned from incidental references.

                       tain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem"
                       (Rom. 15:25, 26).

                            Paul established the church at Corinth on his second mis-
                        sionary journey, A.D. 49-52. (See Acts 18:1-18.) On his third
                        journey, A.D. 53-58, he visited Corinth again (Acts 20:2, 3), and
                        at this time he received offerings for the saints in Jerusalem
                        (Acts 24:17; 1 Cor. 16:1-5). Since Paul did not arrive in Corinth
                        till near the end of his journey (arriving perhaps late in A.D. 57
                        and leaving early in A.D. 58), the Epistle to the Romans was
                        written probably in the early months of A.D. 58.

                         What other important churches had Paul visited on his third
                        missionary journey? Acts 18:23.

                           Visiting the Galatian churches, Paul discovered that during
                        his absence false teachers, often called Judaizers, had visited
                        these churches, convincing the members to submit to circum-
                        cision and to keep other precepts of the law of Moses. Discover-
                        ing what had happened, Paul became extremely upset (Gal.
                        3:1-4). Fearing that his opponents might reach Rome before he
                        arrived, Paul wrote a letter (Romans) to forestall the same
                        tragedy happening in Rome. It is believed that the Epistle to the
                        Galatians was written also from Corinth during Paul's three
                        months there on his third missionary journey, perhaps shortly
                        after his arrival. Perhaps the letter to the Romans was written
                        after the one to the Galatians. At any rate, it is the more reasoned
                        of the two, and its tone is calmer. On the purpose of writing
                        Romans, Ellen White says:
                           "In his epistle to the Romans, Paul set forth the great princi-
                        ples of the gospel. He stated his position on the questions which
                        were agitating the Jewish and the Gentile churches, and
                        showed that the hopes and promises which had once belonged
                        especially to the Jews were now offered to the Gentiles
                        also."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 373.
                           The statement "He [Paul] stated his position on the questions
                        which were agitating the Jewish and Gentile churches" is sig-
                        nificant. It is important in the study of any book of the Bible to
                        know the occasion for the book's being written and the aim the
                        author had in mind in writing the book. Hence it is important for
                        our understanding of the Epistle to the Romans to know what
                        were the questions agitating the Jewish and Gentile churches.
                        Next week's lesson will deal with these questions.

     ANNOUNCEMENT believers?
       OF INTENDED
               VISIT   "But now having no more place in these parts, and having a
                     desire these many years to come unto you; whensoever I take
                     my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you
                     in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by
                     you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company" (Rom.
                     15:23, 24).
                         The great missionary to the Gentiles felt constantly impelled
                      to take the gospel to hitherto unentered areas, leaving others to
                      labor in areas where the gospel had been established. In the
                      days when Christianity was young and the laborers were few it
                      would have been a waste of valuable missionary power for Paul
                      to work in already entered areas. He said, "So have I strived to
                      preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should
                      build upon another man's foundation," so that "they that have
                      not heard shall understand" (Rom. 15:20, 21).
                         It was not Paul's purpose to settle down at Rome. It was his
                      aim to evangelize Spain. He hoped to get the support of the
                      Christians in Rome for this venture.
                         "After many unavoidable delays, Paul at last reached Co-
                      rinth...
                         "During his sojourn at Corinth, Paul found time to look for-
                      ward to new and wider fields of service. His contemplated jour-
                      ney to Rome especially occupied his thoughts. To see the Chris-
                      tian faith firmly established at the great center of the known
                      world was one of his dearest hopes and most cherished plans. A
                      church had already been established in Rome, and the apostle
                      desired to secure the co-operation of the believers there in the
                      work to be accomplished in Italy and in other countries. To
                      prepare the way for his labors among these brethren, many of
                      whom were as yet strangers to him, he sent them a letter an-
                      nouncing his purpose of visiting Rome and his hope of planting
                      the standard of the cross in Spain."—The Acts of the Apostles,
                      pp. 372, 373.

THINK IT THROUGH         What impetus would be given to the spread of the gospel if
                      all evangelistic workers covered their territories so thor-
                      oughly that they too could say, "But now having no more place
                      in these parts"?

                        "What the church needs in these days of peril is an army of
                      workers who, like Paul, have educated themselves for useful-
                      ness, who have a deep experience in the things of God, and who
                      are filled with earnestness and zeal. Sanctified, self-sacrificing
                      men are needed; men who will not shun trial and responsibility;
                      men who are brave and true."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 507.

                                                                    January 2
         Part 4 "When we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the pris-
   PAUL REACHES oners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to
         ROME dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him" (Acts 28:16).

                      When Paul reached Jerusalem at the end of his third mission-
                   ary journey with his offering for the poor, collected in the con-
                   gregations of Europe and Asia Minor, unexpected events
                   awaited him. He was arrested and fettered. After being held
                   prisoner for two years at Caesarea, he appealed to Caesar.
                   Some three years after his arrest he arrived at Rome, still a
                   prisoner. This was a very different arrival from the one he had
                   planned when he announced in his letter to the Roman Chris-
                   tians that he intended to visit them.

                     In what evangelistic work did Paul engage? Acts 28:17, 23,
                   24, 30, 31.

                     "When the Christian churches first learned that Paul was to
                   visit Rome, they looked forward to a signal triumph of the
                   gospel in that city. Paul had borne the truth to many lands; he
                   had proclaimed it in great cities. Might not this champion of the
                   faith succeed in winning souls to Christ even in the metropolis
                   of the world? But their hopes were crushed by the tidings that
                   Paul had gone to Rome as a prisoner. . . .
                     "Not by Paul's sermons, but by his bonds, was the attention of
                   the court attracted to Christianity. It was as a captive that he
                   broke from so many souls the bonds that held them in the
                   slavery of sin. Nor was this all. He declared: 'Many of the breth-
                   ren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more
                   bold to speak the word without fear.' Philippians 1:14."—The
                   Acts of the Apostles, pp. 463, 464.
                      "During Paul's imprisonment the converts to Christianity had
                   become so numerous as to attract the attention and arouse the
                   enmity of the authorities. The anger of the emperor was espe-
                   cially excited by the conversion of members of his own
                   household."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 487.

THINK IT THROUGH     To what extend have we seen seeming setbacks and mis-
                   fortunes in our lives turn into victories for the gospel? (See
                   Phil. 1:12.)

                      "While apparently cut off from active labor, Paul exerted a
                   widpr and more lasting influence than if he had been free to
                   travel among the churches as in former years. As a prisoner of
                   the Lord, he had a firmer hold upon the affections of his breth-
                   ren; and his words, written by one under bonds for the sake of
                   Christ, commanded greater attention and respect than they did
                   when he was personally with them."—The Acts of the Apostles,

                                                                        January 3
             Part 5  How are the recipients of the Epistle to the Romans de-
     THE SALUTATION scribed?

                       "To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints:
                     Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord
                     Jesus Christ" (Rom. 1:7).

                       Beloved of God. While it is true that God loves the world, in a
                     special sense God loves those who have chosen Him, those who
                     have responded to His love. This is true also in the human
                     sphere. We love in a special way those who love us, for with
                     them there is a mutual exchange of affection. Love demands
                     response. When the response is not forthcoming, love is limited
                     in its fullest expression.
                       Called to be saints. In some editions of the King James Ver-
                     sion "to be" is in italics, which means that the translators have
                     supplied the words. They can be left out. When they are omitted
                     we get the expression "called saints," that is, "designated
                     saints."
                        "Saints" is the translation of the Greek hagioi, which literally
                     means "holy ones." Holy means "dedicated." A saint is one who
                     has dedicated himself to God. He may still have a long way to go
                     in sanctification, but the fact that he has chosen Christ as his
                     Lord designates him a "saint" in the Bible meaning of the term.
                        Because of the current use of "saint" for one extraordinarily
                     charitable, patient, and self-denying, the biblical term is often
                     misunderstood. Because of this circumstance, certain modern
                     translations use for hagioi terms such as "dedicated people"
                     (NEB), "his [God's] own people" (TEV), and "Christ's men and
                     women" (Phillips).
                       Those who had accepted the Christian faith in Rome, Paul
                     calls hagioi, a term almost equivalent to "Christians," if by
                     "Christian" is meant one sincerely dedicated to Christ.
                        "If you would be a saint in heaven, you must first be a saint on
                     earth. The traits of character you cherish in life will not be
                     changed by death or by the resurrection."—The Adventist
                     Home, p. 16.

THINK IT THROUGH        If the Bible repeatedly calls the members of the early Chris-
                     tian congregations saints (compare 1 Cor. 1:2; 2 Cor. 1:1; Eph.
                     1:1; Phil. 1:1, etc.), what would you conclude about the use of
                     "saints" for members of the Christian community today?

                       "The eternal God has drawn the line of distinction between
                     the saint and the sinner, between converted and unconverted.
                     The two classes do not blend into each other imperceptibly, like
                     the colors of a rainbow, but are as distinct as midday and
                     midnight."—Messages to Young People, p. 390.

                                                                      January 4
          Part 6   What reputation had the believers in the church of Rome
         WORLD gained?
     REPUTATION
                   "First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that
                 your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world" (Rom. 1:8).

                      It is not known how the congregation in Rome became estab-
                   lished. The tradition that the church was founded by Peter or
                   Paul is without historical foundation. Perhaps lay persons es-
                   tablished it, converts on the Day of Pentecost in Jerusalem (Acts
                   2), who visited or moved to Rome. Or perhaps at some later
                   period converts moving to Rome witnessed to their faith in that
                   world capital.
                      It is surprising that, in a few decades from Pentecost, a con-
                   gregation that apparently had received no apostolic visit should
                   be so widely known. "Notwithstanding the opposition, twenty
                   years after the crucifixion of Christ there was a live, earnest
                   church in Rome. This church was strong and zealous, and the
                   Lord worked for it."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible
                   Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1067. The church must have had strong
                   leadership. Probably the gifts of the Spirit had miraculously
                   supplied leadership and other abilities. (See 1 Cor. 10:28.)
                       "Faith" here probably includes the broader sense of faithful-
                   ness, that is, faithfulness to the new way they had discovered.

                     How confident was Paul in the experience of the Roman
                   believer? Rom. 15:14.

                     The three items that Paul selects as worthy of note in the
                   Roman Christians' experience are:
                     1. "Full of goodness." Would people say this of our own
                   experience? As they associate with us, is it the abundance of
                   goodness in us that attracts their attention?
                     2. "Filled with all knowledge." The Bible repeatedly em-
                   phasizes the importance of enlightenment, information, and
                   knowledge. Christians are urged to study the Bible and to be-
                   come well informed as to its teachings. "The words, 'A new
                   heart also will I give you,' mean, 'A new mind will I give you.' A
                   change of heart is always attended by a clear conviction of
                   Christian duty, an understanding of truth."—My Life Today,
                   p. 24.
                     3. "Able . . . to admonish one another." No man can thrive
                   spiritually if he isolates himself from his fellowmen. They need
                   his encouragement and he should develop the ability to en-
                   courage others with his words.

THINK IT THROUGH    Has the church in my city gained a reputation in the whole
                   world? If so, for what? For its faith? Or its faithfulness?

                                           will help us to draw valid lessons from
                                           it for today.

              Part 1     By what means had the Jews been taught that life would
     OLD TESTAMENT     come to them?
          SALVATION
                         "Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments:
                       which if a man do, he shall live in them: I am the Lord" (Lev.
                       18:5). (Compare Rom. 10:5.)

                          In order to comprehend the book of Romans correctly, it is
                       necessary to understand the point of controversy between Paul
                       and the Judaizers. The Judaizers were Jewish converts to Chris-
                       tianity who insisted that Gentile Christians should be circum-
                       cised and keep the law of Moses. It seemed to the Jews that Paul
                       was teaching another way of salvation when he set forth faith in
                       the Messiah as the ground of salvation. Although this aspect of
                       faith in a Messiah to come had been taught by the sacrificial
                       system, it appears that the true import had not been grasped, at
                       least not by the majority of the Jews. Otherwise, the basic
                       requirements had not changed. "The conditions of salvation
                       are ever the same. Life, eternal life, is for all who will obey God's
                       law."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary,
                       vol. 7, p. 931.
                          "The terms of the 'old covenant' were, Obey and live: `If a man
                       do, he shall even live in them' (Ezekiel 20:11; Leviticus 18:5); but
                       `cursed be he that confirmeth not all the words of this law to do
                       them.' Deuteronomy 27:26. The 'new covenant' was established
                       upon 'better promises'—the promise of forgiveness of sins and
                       of the grace of God to renew the heart and bring it into harmony
                       with the principles of God's law."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p.
                       372.

                         How may God's requirements be summed up? Micah 6:8.

                          "But if the Abrahamic covenant contained the promise of
                       redemption, why was another covenant formed at Sinai? In their
                       bondage the people had to a great extent lost the knowledge of
                       God and of the principles of the Abrahamic covenant. . . .
                          " . . . The people did not realize the sinfulness of their own
                       hearts, and that without Christ it was impossible for them to
                       keep God's law; and they readily entered into covenant with
                       God."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 371, 372.
                          Although the old covenant was intended to be temporary, to
                       last only until the Abrahamic covenant was understood, by and
                       large the Israelites never made this transition. In Paul's day the
                       Jews were still largely under the stipulations and conditions of
                       the old covenant.

THINK IT THROUGH         While professing to live under the new covenant, how can I
                       avoid in practice living under the old? (See Heb. 8:10-13.)

Jew Versus Gentile      LESSON 2                                   ❑ Monday
                                                                     January 7
          Part 2 What is the difference between the religion of the Old Tes-
   OLD AND NEW tament and that of the New?
     TESTAMENT
       RELIGION  "The law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by
      COMPARED Jesus Christ" (John 1:17).

                    "The requirement of God under the covenant of grace is just
                  as broad as the requirement He made in Paradise—harmony
                  with His law, which is holy, and just, and good. The gospel does
                  not weaken the claims of the law; it exalts the law and makes it
                  honorable. Under the New Testament, no less is required than
                  was required under the Old Testament. Let no one take up with
                  the delusion so pleasant to the natural heart, that God will
                  accept of sincerity, no matter what may be the faith, no matter
                  how imperfect may be the life. God requires of His child perfect
                  obedience."—Selected Messages, bk. 1-, pp. 373, 374.

                    What did Jesus state were the conditions for eternal life?
                  John 3:16.

                    Perhaps the greatest difference between the religion of the
                  Old Testament and that of the New is the fact that the New
                  Testament era was introduced by the coming of the Messiah—
                  Jesus of Nazareth. He was sent by God to be the Saviour. Men
                  could not ignore Him and expect to be saved. Only through the
                  atonement He provided could they have their sins forgiven. Only
                  by the imputation of His perfect life could they stand before God
                  without condemnation.
                    Old Testament saints looked forward to the blessings of the
                  Messianic age. In New Testament times men were confronted
                  with the question, Would they accept Jesus of Nazareth whom
                  God had sent as the Messiah, their Saviour? If they believed on
                  Him—that is, if they accepted Him for whom He truly was and
                  committed themselves to Him—they would be saved.
                    The basic moral requirements remained unchanged in the
                  New Testament, for these were founded in the character of God
                  and of Christ. Perfect obedience to the moral law was required
                  in both Old and New Testament times.
                    Ritual requirements changed—the sacrifices eventually were
                  discontinued. Type had met antitype—circumcision was dis-
                  continued and baptism was introduced.
                    Helping both Jew and Gentile to understand what was in-
                  volved in this transition from Judaism to Christianity was one of
                  Paul's principal aims in the book of Romans. It would take time
                  to make the transition.

                                                                           January 8
               Part 3   What various laws were the Jews expected to keep?
     CLASSIFICATIONS
      OF JEWISH LAW "These are the commandments, which the Lord com-
                      manded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai" (Lev.
                      27:34). (See also Ex. 16:26; 18:20; 20:1-17; 21:1; Lev. 1:1-3;
                      11:2, 9, 13, 29; 12:2; 25:18.)

                         It is convenient for us to classify Old Testament laws into
                      various categories: (1) moral law, (2) ceremonial law, (3) civil
                      law, (4) statutes and judgments, (5) health laws.
                         This classification is in part artificial. In actuality some of
                      these categories are interrelated, and there is considerable
                      overlap. The ancients did not see them as separate and distinct.
                         The moral law is basically the Ten Commandment law (Ex.
                      20:1-17). This law sums up the moral requirements of man.
                      These ten precepts are amplified and applied in various statutes
                      and judgments throughout the first five books of the Bible.
                      These amplifications show what it meant to keep the law of God
                      in various situations. Not unrelated are the civil laws. These, too,
                      are based on the moral law. These define a citizen's relationship
                      to civil authorities and to his fellow citizens. They name the
                      penalties for various infractions.
                         The ceremonial law regulated the sanctuary ritual, describing
                      the various offerings and the individual citizen's respon-
                      sibilities. The feast days are specified and their observance
                      defined.
                         The health laws overlap the other laws. The various laws
                      relating to uncleanness define ceremonial uncleanness, and yet
                      go beyond this to include hygienic and health principles. Laws
                      regarding clean and unclean meats are based on physical con-
                      siderations.
                         While the Jew probably largely thought of all of these laws as
                      a package, having all come from God, he must have made
                      certain distinctions in his mind. The Ten Commandment law
                      had been spoken by God directly to the people. This would set it
                      apart as especially important. The other laws had been relayed
                      through Moses. The sanctuary ritual could be kept only when a
                      sanctuary was in operation.
                         The civil laws, at least in large part, could be no longer im-
                      posed after the Jews lost their independence and came under
                      the civil control of another nation. Many of the ceremonial
                      precepts could no longer be observed after the temple was
                      destroyed. Also, after the Messiah came, many of the types had
                      met their antitype and no longer had validity.
                         As used in the book of Romans, "law" has various meanings,
                      as will be pointed out. It is important that its wide scope be
                      understood.

           Pad 4    What point of controversy arose shortly after the establish-
   THE JUDAIZERS   ment of the Christian church?

                     "Certain men which came down from Judaea taught the
                   brethren, and said, Except ye be circumcised after the manner
                   of Moses, ye cannot be saved" (Acts 15:1).

                      "While the apostles united with the ministers and lay mem-
                   bers at Antioch in an earnest effort to win many souls to Christ,
                   certain Jewish believers from Judea 'of the sect of the
                   Pharisees' succeeded in introducing a question that soon led to
                   wide-spread controversy in the church and brought consterna-
                   tion to the believing Gentiles. With great assurance these
                   Judaizing teachers asserted that in order to be saved, one must
                   be circumcised and must keep the entire ceremonial law. . . .
                      "The Jews had always prided themselves upon their divinely
                   appointed services, and many of those who had been converted
                   to the faith of Christ still felt that since God had once clearly
                   outlined the Hebrew manner of worship, it was improbable that
                   He would ever authorize a change in any of its specifications.
                   They insisted that the Jewish laws and ceremonies should be
                   incorporated into the rites of the Christian religion. They were
                   slow to discern that all the sacrificial offerings had but pre-
                   figured the death of the Son of God, in which type met antitype,
                   and after which the rites and ceremonies of the Mosaic dispen-
                   sation were no longer bind ing."—The Acts of the Apostles, pp.
                   188, 189.

                     What course was suggested to settle this dispute? Acts
                   15:2.

                     Who were some of the participants who delivered speeches
                   at the conference? Acts 15:7, 12, 13.

                     "While looking to God for direct guidance, he [Paul] was ever
                   ready to recognize the authority vested in the body of believers
                   united in church fellowship. He felt the need of counsel, and
                   when matters of importance arose, he was glad to lay these
                   before the church and to unite with his brethren in seeking God
                   for wisdom to make right decisions. Even 'the spirits of the
                   prophets,' he declared, 'are subject to the prophets. For God is
                   not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of
                   the saints.' 1 Corinthians 14:32."—The Acts of the Apostles, p.

        DECISION      "Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which

                      "For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon

                    15:19, 20, 28).

                       The decision was against the contentions of the Judaizers.
                    These troublemakers insisted that the Gentile converts "be
                    circumcised and . . . keep the entire ceremonial law" and that
                    "the Jewish laws and ceremonies should be incorporated into
                    the rites of the Christian religion."—The Acts of the Apostles, p.
                    189.

                      How did Peter characterize the Jewish laws? Acts 15:10.

                      Through their oral traditions the Jews had so bound about the
                    laws of God with regulations of their own that Peter's charac-
                    terization was indeed correct. The Jews in the apostles' day
                    thought that the way to keep these various laws was to do what
                    the rabbis had prescribed.
                      How were the Gentile converts to relate to the moral law?
                    There never was any controversy between Paul and the Judaiz-
                    ers as to whether the moral law should be observed by the
                    Gentile converts. This law, spoken by God, is as eternal as God
                    Himself and is a transcript of His character.

                      How united was the vote of the council? Acts 15:22.

                      It was heartening that a point that could have split wide open
                    the infant church could be thus amicably settled.

                       "The Gentiles, however, were to take no course which should
                    materially conflict with the views of their Jewish brethren, or
                    which would create prejudice in their minds against them. The
                    apostles and elders therefore agreed to instruct the Gentiles by
                    letter to abstain from meats offered to idols, from fornication,
                    from things strangled, and from blood. They were required to
                    keep the commandments and to lead holy lives. The Gentiles
                    were assured that the men who had urged circumcision upon
                    them were not authorized to do so by the apostles."—The Story

                                                                        January 11
           Part 6    What disruption had the Judaizers brought about in the
    THE GALATIAN    Galatian churches?
         HERESY
                      "I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called
                    you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel: Which is not
                    another; but there be some that trouble you, and would per-
                    vert the gospel of Christ" (Gal. 1:6, 7).

                        "Through the influence of false teachers who had arisen
                    among the believers in Jerusalem, division, heresy, and sen-
                    sualism were rapidly gaining ground among the believers in
                    Galatia. These false teachers were mingling Jewish traditions
                    with the truths of the gospel. Ignoring the decision of the gen-
                    eral council at Jerusalem, they urged upon the Gentile converts
                    the observance of the ceremonial law."—The Acts of the Apos-
                    tles, p. 383.
                        "Christ, the true foundation of the faith, was virtually re-
                    nounced for the obsolete ceremonies of Judaism."—The Acts
                    of the Apostles, p. 385.
                        The reason for bringing up the Galatian problem here is that it
                    was the Galatian situation that in a large degree prompted the
                     content of the letter to the Romans. In the Epistle to the Ro-
                    mans, Paul develops further the theme of the Epistle to the
                    Galatians. The Judaizers were contending that the law God had
                     given them through Moses was important and should be ob-
                     served by Gentile converts. Paul was trying to show its true
                     place and function. He didn't want the Judaizers to gain a
                     foothold in Rome as they had done in Galatia.
                        It is oversimplification simply to decide whether in Galatians
                     and Romans Paul is speaking of ceremonial or moral laws.
                     Historically, the argument, as Ellen White has confirmed it, was
                     whether or not Gentile converts should be required to be cir-
                    cumcised and keep the law of Moses. The Jerusalem council
                    had already ruled on this question, but the Judaizers refused to
                     follow its decision. In all the argumentation the necessity of
                     observing the moral law was never really challenged. Fun-
                     damentalist and evangelical Christians who find in Galatians
                     and in Romans arguments against the moral law misread Paul.
                     They need to familiarize themselves with the historical
                     backgrounds of these epistles and discover that the binding
                     claims of the moral law had never been called into question.
                         Keeping in mind the distinction between the historical mean-
                     ing and the lessons we today may draw from the book will
                     greatly help us in our understanding of this important epistle.
                     To discover what the epistle meant to those to whom it was
                     written and by whom it was first read and what it means to us
                     today is a basic principle to follow in the interpretation of Scrip-
                      ture.

              Part 1     What is the basic theme of the Epistle to the Romans?
       BASIC THEME
           OF BOOK        "I am not ashamed of the gospel: it is the power of God for
                       salvation to every one who has faith, to the Jew first and also
                       to the Greek. For in it the righteousness of God is revealed
                       through faith for faith; as it is written, 'He who through faith is
                       righteous shall live' " (Rom. 1:16, 17, RSV).

                          Several key words occur in this passage:
                         1. Gospel. This word is the translation of a Greek word mean-
                       ing literally "good message," or "good news." Standing alone,
                       the word may refer to any good message; but, modified as it is in
                       this passage by the phrase "of Christ," it means ''the good news
                       about the Messiah" ("Christ" is the transliteration of the Greek
                       word meaning "Messiah"). The good news is that the Messiah
                       has come and men may be saved by believing in Him.
                          2. Righteousness. This word refers to the quality of right. A
                       specialized meaning of this word is developed in the book of
                       Romans, which we shall bring out as our study of the book
                       proceeds. It should also be pointed out that in Romans 1:17 the
                       word is qualified by the phrase "of God." It is righteousness that
                       comes from God or righteousness God has provided.
                         3. Faith. In Greek the words translated "believe" and "faith"
                       (KJV) in this passage are the verb and noun forms of the same
                       word: pisteuo (believe), pistis (belief or faith). The meaning of
                       "faith" as related to salvation will unfold as we progress in the
                       study of Romans.
                         "The righteousness of Christ is revealed from faith to faith;
                       that is, from your present faith to an increased understanding of
                       that faith which works by love and purifies the soul."—Ellen G.
                       White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 6,
                       p. 1067.

                         While there is salvation for those who have faith, what is
                       reserved for those who do not have faith? Rom. 1:18.

                        Either men become righteous through faith, or the wrath of
                       God comes against them for their unrighteousness.

THINK IT THROUGH        Why are Christians sometimes ashamed of the gospel of
                       Christ? What gave Paul boldness to profess his faith?

                         "The truth may be ashamed of us because our course of
                       action is not in harmony with its pure principles, but we need
                       never be ashamed of the truth. As you have opportunity, confess
                       your faith. When anyone asks you, give him a reason of the hope
                       that is in you, with meekness and fear."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p.

                                                                         January 14
             Part 2   What was one of the important points that Paul sought to
          ALL COME establish early in his Epistle to the Romans?
            SHORT
                      "All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God" (Rom.
                    3:23).

                       "All" means Jew, Gentile, old, young, rich, poor, bond, free,
                     professional, blue collar worker.
                       The Jews had no problem admitting that the Gentiles were
                     hopeless, abandoned sinners. But to acknowledge that they,
                     too, were sinners in need of salvation was more than most of
                     them were willing to do.
                       What is meant by the phrase "glory of God"? It has been
                     variously interpreted. Perhaps the simplest interpretation is to
                     give to the phrase the meaning it has in First Corinthians 11:7,
                     "He [man] is the image and glory of God." In Greek the word for
                     "glory" may be considered as loosely equivalent to the word for
                     "image." Sin has marred the image of God in man. Sinful man
                     falls far short of reflecting the image or glory of God.
                       "The central theme of the Bible, the theme about which every
                     other in the whole book clusters, is the redemption plan, the
                     restoration in the human soul of the image of God."—
                     Education, p. 125.

                       What series of proof texts did Paul use to describe man's
                     sinful condition apart from Christ? Rom. 3:10-18.

                        This passage is a series of quotations from the Old Testament.
                     (See marginal references if your Bible has them.)
                        The first step in becoming a Christian is for a person to
                     acknowledge his utter sinfulness, hopelessness, and helpless-
                     ness. It is the work of the Holy Spirit to bring about such convic-
                     tion. If the sinner does not resist Him, the Spirit will lead him to
                     tear away his mask of self-defense, pretense, and self-
                     justification and to cast himself upon Christ, pleading His
                     mercy: "God be merciful to me, the sinner!" (Luke 18:13,
                     NASB).

THINK IT THROUGH       What is it that leads the human heart to justify itself rather
                     than to acknowledge its imperfections?
                       "Many are deceived concerning the condition of their hearts.
                     They do not realize that the natural heart is deceitful above all
                     things, and desperately wicked. They wrap themselves about
                     with their own righteousness, and are satisfied in reaching their
                     own human standard of character; but how fatally they fail when
                     they do not reach the divine standard, and of themselves they
                     cannot meet the requirements of God."—Selected Messages,

            Part 3     What happens to men who refuse to acknowledge God's
       SIN BRINGS    claims upon them?
     DEGRADATION
                       "Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not
                     as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imagi-
                     nations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing
                     themselves to be wise, they became fools" (Rom. 1:21, 22).

                       "In its human wisdom the world cannot know God. Its wise
                     men gather an imperfect knowledge of God from His created
                     works, and then in their foolishness they exalt nature and the
                     laws of nature above nature's God. Those who have not a
                     knowledge of God through an acceptance of the revelation He
                     has made of Himself in Christ, will obtain only an imperfect
                     knowledge of Him in nature; and this knowledge, so far from
                     giving elevated conceptions of God, and bringing the whole
                     being into conformity to His will, will make men idolaters."—

                       How low did men and women fall in their degradation? Rom.
                     1:23-32.

                        The Jews had no difficulty agreeing with Paul that the condi-
                     tion of the Gentiles was most degraded. They felt a strong
                     superiority over them. A Jew, reading this part of Paul's letter,
                     was unprepared for the shock Paul was about to administer by
                     telling him that he was equally sinful. (See Rom. 2:1.)
THINK IT THROUGH       To what extent may the present permissive age be the
                     result of modern man's unwillingness to retain God in his
                     knowledge?

                        "A terrible picture of the condition of the world has been
                     presented before me. Immorality abounds everywhere. Licen-
                     tiousness is the special sin of this age. Never did vice lift its
                     deformed head with such boldness as now. The people seem to
                     be benumbed, and the lovers of virtue and true goodness are
                     nearly discouraged by its boldness, strength, and prevalence.
                     The iniquity which abounds is not merely confined to the unbe-
                     liever and the scoffer. Would that this were the case, but it is not.
                     Many men and women who profess the religion of Christ are
                     guilty. Even some who profess to be looking for His appearing
                     are no more prepared for that event than Satan himself. They
                     are not cleansing themselves from all pollution. They have so
                     long served their lust that it is natural for their thoughts to be
                     impure and their imaginations corrupt. It is as impossible to
                     cause their minds to dwell upon pure and holy things as it would
                     be to turn the course of Niagara and send its waters pouring up
                     the falls."—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 346.

All Have Sinned      LESSON 3                                    ❑ Wednesday
                                                                   January 16
          Part 4  What stinging indictment did Paul make against the Jews
      A STINGING who felt that they were vastly superior to the Gentiles, espe-
     INDICTMENT cially in moral behavior?

                     "Therefore thou art inexcusable, 0 man, whosoever thou
                   art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou con-
                   demnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things"
                   (Rom. 2:1).

                     "Do not think yourself better than other men, and set yourself
                   up as their judge. Since you cannot discern motive, you are
                   incapable of judging another. In criticizing him, you are passing
                   sentence upon yourself; for you show that you are a participant
                   with Satan, the accuser of the brethren."—The Desire of Ages,
                   p.,314.

                     What specific sins of which the Jews were guilty equally
                   with the Gentiles did Paul enumerate? Rom. 2:21-24.

                     The Jews were depending for salvation upon the fact that they
                   were Jews and that God had particularly favored them above
                   other nations. The Jews had been entrusted with a knowledge
                   of salvation, but this knowledge was not merely for their own
                   benefit; they were to pass on this knowledge to other nations.
                     Circumcision was the sign of being a Jew. But this sign was
                   worthless unless it represented conduct worthy of a worshiper
                   of God. "For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law:
                   but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made
                   uncircumcision" (Rom. 2:25).
                     Today baptism is a symbol of commitment to Christ, but if the
                   one baptized lives unworthy of Christ, his baptism is meaning-
                   less. "For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the
                   doers of the law shall be justified" (Rom. 2:13).

                     What new definition of the term "Jew" did Paul give? Rom.
                   2:27-29.

                      This announcement stung the pride of the Jews, but Paul
                   uttered it in love. He was seeking to win his countrymen. They
                   needed to cease looking to their literal descent from Abraham
                   as giving them special advantages, such as a supposed auto-
                   matic acceptance with God. They were now told that their Gen-
                   tile neighbors who had accepted God's plan were true Jews
                   along with believing Jews, whereas the erring descendants of
                   Abraham had lost the right to that name.

THINK IT THROUGH     To what extent is It possible that a knowledge of our own
                   weaknesses helps us to detect more readily the faults of
                   others and thus to be judgmental?

All Have Sinned        LESSON 3                                      ❑ Thursday
                                                                      January 17
             Part 5   What is the purpose of God's goodness, forbearance, and
          ALL NEED longsuffering?
        REPENTANCE
                      "Despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbear-
                    ance and iongsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God
                    leadeth thee to repentance?" (Rom. 2:4).

                       If all have sinned, then all need repentance. The Jews were
                     willing to acknowledge that the Gentiles stood in need of re-
                     pentance but refused to admit that they needed it also.
                       We should notice that God's goodness leads, not forces,
                     sinners to repentance. God uses no coercion. He is infinitely
                     patient and seeks to draw all men by His love.
                       But many despise God's goodness or interpret it to mean that
                     God condones sin and won't do what He has promised.

                       What comes to those who resist God's love and remain
                     impenitent? Rom. 2:5, 6, 8, 9.

                       Disobedience is given as the cause of their suffering the
                     indignation and wrath of God. It is clear, then, that those who,
                     through repentance, escape God's wrath will be obedient. Paul
                     describes them as working (verse 10).
                       Frequently throughout the book of Romans Paul emphasizes
                     the need of good works. Justification by faith without the deeds
                     of the law must never be construed to mean that good works
                     have no place in the Christian life.

                       What comes to those who allow the goodness of God to lead
                     them to repentance? Rom. 2:7, 10.

                       Verse 7 is significant in the light of the theme of the book of
                     Romans—righteousness by faith. Here salvation is described as
                     coming to those who seek for it "by patient continuance in well
                     doing." Therefore human effort plays ,a significant part in the
                     total experience of salvation.
                       The reason many people misapply the book of Romans,
                     claiming that it teaches that works have nothing to do with
                     salvation, is that they already have their ideas formulated and
                     they bend Scripture to fit their ideas. But the Bible must not be
                     used like a fiddle on which one plays any tune he chooses.
                       In our study of Romans we should resolve first to listen to
                     Paul, to find out what he meant to tell the Roman Christians.
                     Then we should pray for the help of the Holy Spirit to draw valid
                     lessons for us today, based on what Paul was actually saying,
                     not on what one could possibly bend the words to mean—to
                     discover what the author, Paul, moved by the Holy Spirit, meant
                     to say by the words he used.

                                                                        January 18
         Part 6  Since the Jew was found to be as guilty before God as the
     GOD'S PLAN Gentile, of what value, if any, had been God's revelation to
      SUCCEEDS him?
                     "What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there
                   of circumcision? Much every way: chiefly, because that unto
                   them were committed the oracles of God" (Rom. 3:1, 2).

                      The oracles (Greek logia, "brief sayings") were the instruc-
                   tions given through Moses concerning the divine will.
                      Because the Jews repeatedly failed and, especially in Paul's
                   day, had committed the ultimate failure in the rejection of the
                   Messiah, God's efforts on their behalf had not been a total
                   failure. Paul raises the question, "What if some did not be-
                   lieve?" (verse 3). There were those in various periods who found
                   salvation through the "logia of God."
                      But as a nation the Israelites failed repeatedly to fulfill their
                   divine purpose. The nation suffered repeated reverses and cap-
                   tivities as a result, but during all this time there were individuals
                   who found a saving relationship with their God.
                      But nationally, except for brief periods, the history of the Jews
                   had been a disaster. Finally, as the parable says (Matt. 21:43),
                   the kingdom of God, the privilege of being God's peculiar
                   evangelistic agency was taken away.

                     How did Paul meet the charge that the failure of the Jews
                   cast a reflection on God's integrity? Rom. 3:3, 4.
                     Here, as elsewhere in the book of Romans, Paul squelches
                   any possible criticism of God or of God's dealings with the
                   human family. His vigorous response should be a warning to
                   modern, arrogant man who feels free to criticize God.

                     How did Paul meet the slanderous charge lodged against
                   him? Rom. 3:5-8.
                     The Jews were quick to pick whatever flaws they could in the
                   content of Paul's gospel. If righteousness is by faith and not by
                   works, they contended, then people's sinning did God a good
                   turn, for it gave Him an opportunity to reveal His goodness and
                   forgiveness. Then, they said, God should not hold the sinner
                   guilty. Paul did not even bother to answer the argument.

THINK IT THROUGH     When tempted to question God's leading in our lives, how
                   can we reassure ourselves that God's way is always the best
                   way?
                     "God never leads His children otherwise than they would
                   choose to be led, if they could see the end from the
                   beginning."—The Desire of Ages, p. 224.

                                                                        January 20
           Part 1      What is the law's function?
     LAW CANNOT
            SAVE      "Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith
                    to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be
                    stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God"
                    (Rom. 3:19).

                       Paul is here using the term "law" in its broad sense as the Jew
                    in his day understood it. By the term "Torah" (the Hebrew word
                    for "law") a Jew even today thinks particularly of God's instruc-
                    tion in the Pentateuch, but also more generally in the entire Old
                    Testament. The moral law, plus the amplification of this in the
                    statutes and judgments, as well as the ceremonial precepts,
                    were a part of this instruction. Because of this, we may think of
                    the law here as the system of Judaism.
                       To be under the law means to be under its jurisdiction, as
                    were the Jews under the Torah. The law reveals a person's
                    shortcomings and thus one's guilt before God. It cannot remove
                    that guilt, but hopefully the sense of guilt will lead the sinner to
                    seek a remedy.
                       As we apply the book of Romans in our day when Jewish law is
                    no longer a factor, we think of law particularly in terms of moral
                    law. This law can save us no more than could the system of
                    Judaism save the Jews. To save is not the moral law's function.
                    Its function is to reveal God's character and to show people
                    wherein they fall short of reflecting that character.

                      What is lawkeeping unable to accomplish and why? Rom.
                    3:20.

                       We must at this point remember the basic argument of the
                    Judaizers: "In order to be saved, one must be circumcised and
                    must keep the entire ceremonial law."—The Acts of the Apos-
                    tles, pp. 188, 189.
                       Whatever law it is—moral, ceremonial, civil, or all combined
                    —a keeping of any or all in and of itself will not make a man just
                    in God's sight.
                       "Though the law cannot remit the penalty for sin, but charges
                    the sinner with all his debt, Christ has promised abundant par-
                    don to all who repent, and believe in His mercy. The love of God
                    is extended in abundance to the repenting, believing soul. The
                    brand of sin upon the soul can be effaced only through the
                    blood of the atoning Sacrifice. No less an offering was required
                    than the sacrifice of Him who was equal with the Father. The
                    work of Christ—His life, humiliation, death, and intercession for
                    lost man—magnifies the law, and makes it honorable."—

Justified by Faith      LESSON 4                                        ❑ Monday
                                                                        January 21

           Part 2    When Jesus came, what new kind of righteousness was
       FAITH AND manifested?
  RIGHTEOUSNESS
                     "Now the righteousness of God without the law is man-
                  ifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets" (Rom.
                  3:21).

                     This new righteousness is contrasted with the righteousness
                   of the law, which was the righteousness with which the Jew was
                   familiar.
                      The new righteousness is called "the righteousness of God";
                   that is, a righteousness that comes from God, a righteousness
                   that God provides, and one that He accepts as valid.
                      "Righteousness is obedience to the law. The law demands
                   righteousness, and this the sinner owes to the law; but he
                   incapable of rendering it. The only way in which he can attain to
                   righteousness is through faith. By faith he can bring to God the
                   merits of Christ, and the Lord places the obedience of His Son to
                   the sinner's account. Christ's righteousness. is accepted in
                   place of man's failure, and God receives, pardons, justifies, the
                   repentant, believing soul, treats him as though he were righ-
                   teous, and loves him as He loves His Son."—Selected Mes-
                   sages, bk. 1, p. 367.

                       How is the righteousness of God received? Rom. 3:22.

                        The faith of Jesus Christ is here doubtless faith in Jesus Christ
                     (objective genitive). As it operates in the Christian life faith is
                     much more than intellectual assent. Faith in Jesus Christ is
                     accepting Him as Saviour, substitute, and surety. It is choosing
                     His way of life. It is trusting Him.
                        Both of the words "faith" and "believe" appear in Romans
                     3:22. In English a distinction is sometimes made between be-
                     lieving and having faith. We have observed before that no such
                     distinction exists in Greek. The word for faith ispistis, the word
                     for believe is pisteud. Pistis and pisteu6 are the noun and verb
                     forms of the same word.
                        "Faith is the condition upon which God has seen fit to prom-
                     ise pardon to sinners; not that there is any virtue in faith
                     whereby salvation is merited, but because faith can lay hold of
                     the merits of Christ, the remedy provided for sin. Faith can
                     present Christ's perfect obedience instead of the sinner's
                      transgression and defedtion. When the sinner believes that
                     Christ is his personal Saviour, then, according to His unfailing
                      promises, God pardons his sin, and justifies him freely. The
                      repentant soul realizes that his justification comes because
                      Christ, as his substitute and surety, has died for him, is his
                      atonement and righteousness."—Selected Messages, bk. 1, pp.

Justified by Faith          LESSON 4                                       ❑ Tuesday
                                                                            January 22
               Part 3     How is God's grace related to justification?
          GRACE AND
       JUSTIFICATION      "Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption
                        that is in Christ Jesus" (Rom. 3:24).
                           What is justification? The Greek word dikaiod translated
                        "justify" may mean "make righteous" or "declare righteous,"
                         or "consider righteous." The precise meaning in any instance
                        must be determined by the context. It is built on the same root as
                        is the word dikaios, which means "righteous." There is also the
                         word dikaiosune, "righteousness," and the word dikaioma,
                        "righteous requirement."
                           Unfortunately, the English language uses words built on
                        different roots to translate the various words built on only one
                        root in the Greek. As a result the close connection between
                        "justification" and "righteousness" is not always seen. Before
                        justification, a person is unrighteous, hence unacceptable to
                        God. After justification he is regarded as righteous, hence ac-
                        ceptable.
                           Grace means favor. God's grace is not only the favor He
                        shows; it is also that which God does for a person whom He
                        favors. When a sinner turns to God for salvation, it is an act of
                        grace to consider or declare that person to be righteous.
                           "Grace is unmerited favor. The angels, who know nothing of
                        sin, do not understand what it is to have grace exercised toward
                        them; but our sinfulness calls for the exercise of grace from a
                        merciful God."—Selected Messages, bk. 1, pp. 331, 332.
                           Justification is presented in Romans as a punctiliar act; that
                        is, it happens at a point of time. One moment the sinner is
                        outside, unrighteous, and unaccepted; the next moment, fol-
                        lowing justification, he is inside, accepted, and righteous.
                           Thus the person who is in Christ looks upon justification as a
                        past act, one that took place when he surrendered himself fully
                        to Christ. "Being justified" (Rom. 5:1) is, literally, "having been
                        justified."
                           Of course, if the justified sinner should fall away and then
                        return to Christ, justification would again occur. Also, if recon-
                        version is considered a daily experience, there is a sense in
                        which justification might be considered a repeating experience.
                        Ellen White speaks of justification being "retained." (See
                        Selected Messages, bk. 1, p. 366.)

THINK IT THROUGH          What part does Jesus Christ play in God's justifying act?
                          "Grace is unmerited favor, and the believer is justified without
                        any merit of his own, without any claim to offer to God. He is
                        justified through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, who
                        stands in the courts of heaven as the sinner's substitute and
                        surety."—Selected Messages, bk. 1, p. 398.

Justified by Faith     LESSON 4                                   ❑ Wednesday
                                                                    January 23
            Part 4   What are various significant elements in the justification
     ELEMENTS OF act?
    JUSTIFICATION
                     "Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith
                   in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of
                   sins that are past, through the forbearance of God" (Rom.
                   3:25).

                        Propitiation. The Greek word thus translated, hilasterion,
                    occurs in the New Testament only here and in Hebrews 9:5,
                    where it is translated "mercyseat."
                        "As used here in Rom. 3:25, and in this context describing the
                    offer of justification and redemption through Christ, hilaster-
                    ion, 'propitiation,' seems to represent the fulfillment of all that
                     was typified by the hilasterion, 'mercy seat,' in the OT
                    sanctuary. By His sacrificial death, Jesus has been set forth as
                    the means of atonement, expiation (see DA 469), propitiation
                     (see SC 15), reconciliation. There is perhaps no one English
                     word that can adequately portray all that this implies."—S.D.A.
                    Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 506.
                        God is represented as the one providing the propitiation. The
                     Father and the Son cooperate together in the work of redemp-
                     tion. Each plays His part. Some Christians seem to forget this.
                     So often, when discussing redemption, they mention only
                     Christ, as though the Father were not involved. This is not the
                     way the salvation act is presented in Romans or in the New
                     Testament generally. (See Rom. 1:1-3, 7, 8; 1 Cor. 1:3, 4; etc.)
                     When the two members of the Deity are mentioned together,
                     God the Father is usually mentioned first, as in the verses above.
                        Remission of sins. It is our sins that make us unacceptable to
                     God. We can do nothing of ourselves to cancel our sins. But,in
                     the plan of redemption God has provided a way for these sins to
                     be remitted through faith in Christ's blood.
                        The word for "remission" is the Greek paresis, literally "pass-
                     ing over" or "passing by." It is a different word than the one
                     translated "forgiveness" in the New Testament.
                         The "passing over" is in no sense an ignoring of sins. God can
                      pass over the sins of the past because by His death Christ has
                      paid the penalty for all men's sins. Anyone, therefore, who has
                      "faith in his blood" can have his sins remitted, for Christ has
                      already died for them (1 Cor. 15:3).

 THINK IT THROUGH      When God remits sins, how completely is the sinner free of
                     them?

                        "Christ's character stands in place of your character, and you
                     are accepted before God just as if you had not sinned."—Steps

             Part 5     In justification by faith, what is the central focus?
         FOCUS OF
     JUSTIFICATION      "To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he
                      might be just, and the Justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.
                      Where Is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of
                      works? Nay: but by the law of faith" (Rom. 3:26, 27).

                          The good news that Paul was anxious to share with all who
                       would listen was that there was available to man "his [that is,
                       God's] righteousness." Through long centuries the Jews had
                       focused on their own righteousness. "They being ignorant of
                       God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own
                       righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righ-
                       teousness of God" (Rom. 10:3).
                          After their return from Babylonian captivity, the Jews tried
                       scrupulously to keep the law. They realized that it had been their
                       transgression of the law that led to their captivity. (See 2 Chron.
                       36:14-17.) Because they did not wish to repeat their mistake,
                       their lawyers and rabbis outlined in minute detail how each
                       precept of the Old Testament was to be kept. For example, they
                       defined the length of a Sabbath day's journey as 2000 cubits.
                       They determined by weight or type what constituted a burden
                      that was not to be carried on the Sabbath day. Their tithing laws
                       were minutely detailed.
                         In Jesus' day these various laws existed orally. A short time
                       later they were written down. The Mishnah details this oral
                      tradition. After its production, Jewish rabbis commented on the
                      Mishnah. These comments were eventually combined with the
                      Mishnah in the Talmud.
                         To the Jew, to worship God correctly meant to keep these oral
                      traditions, which they took to be not human laws but a God-
                      endorsed detailing of how God's law was to be kept.
                         Thus the Jewish mind was focused almost completely on self,
                      on how a person could keep all the minute details of oral tradi-
                      tion in order to please God.
                         Jesus severely attacked this oral tradition. He said, "In vain
                      they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments
                      of men" (Matt. 15:9).
                         What a relief it must have been for the scrupulous Jew to
                      discover that he could look away from himself to God's righ-
                      teousness and that by accepting it he could be accepted by
                      God.
                         Because of the cross of Calvary God can declare sinners
                      righteous and still be considered just in the eyes of the universe.
                      Satan can point no accusing finger at God, for Heaven had
                      made the supreme sacrifice. Satan had accused God of asking
                      of the human race more than He was willing to give. The cross
                      refutes this claim.

Justified by Faith    LESSON 4                                            ❑ Friday
                                                                         January 25
          Pad 6     What conclusion did Paul draw from his discussion of God's
       FAITH AND righteousness?
         WORKS
                   "Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith
                 without the deeds of the law" (Rom. 3:28).

                      In the historical context Paul was speaking of law in its broad
                   sense of the system of Judaism. No matter how conscientiously
                   a Jew tried to live under this system, if he failed to accept Jesus
                   as the Messiah, he could not be justified.
                      This verse (Rom. 3:28) is Paul's conclusion from his claim that
                   the law of faith excludes boasting. If a man were justified by his
                   own actions, he could boast about it. But when he is justified
                   because Jesus is the object of his faith, then the credit clearly
                   belongs to God who justified and not to the man who is justified.
                   All the glory is to God. Ellen White asks, "What is justification?"
                   and then answers: "It is the work of God in laying the glory of
                   man in the dust, and doing for man that which it is not in his
                   power to do for himself."—Testimonies to Ministers, p. 456.
                       "Works of law cannot atone for past sins. Justification cannot
                   be earned. It can only be received by faith in the atoning sac-
                   rifice of Christ. Therefore, in this sense, works of law have
                   nothing to do with justification. To be justified without works
                   means to be justified without there being anything in ourselves
                   to merit justification."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 509.
                       But many Christians have misunderstood and misapplied this
                    text. They say all one has to do is to believe. They depreciate
                    works and the keeping of even the moral law. Thus they com-
                    pletely misread Paul. Paul attaches great importance to the
                    keeping of the moral law, both in the book of Romans, and
                    elsewhere. His point is that the keeping of the law is not the
                   means of justification, but he has previously established that
                    the justified person is a doer of the law. (See Rom. 2:13.)
                       Ellen White wrote much on the relation of faith and works.
                    Notice one such passage:
                       "Works will never save us; it is the merit of Christ that will avail
                    in our behalf. Through faith in him, Christ will make all our
                    imperfect efforts acceptableto God. The faith we are required to
                    have is not a do-nothing faith; saving faith is that which works
                    by love, and purifies the soul. He who will lift up holy hands to
                    God without wrath and doubting, will walk intelligently in the
                     way of God's commandments.
                       "If we are to have pardon for our sins, we must first have a
                     realization of what sin is, that we may repent, and bring forth
                    fruits meet for repentance. We must have a solid foundation for
                     our faith; it must be founded on the word of God, and its results
                     will be seen in obedience to God's expressed will."—Ellen G.

ukification and the Law
Justification and the Law          LESSON 5                               ❑ Sunday
                                                                          January 27
           Part 1     How did Paul answer a common charge of the Judaizers
         THE LAW    against him?
     ESTABLISHED
                      "Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid:
                    yea, we establish the law" (Rom. 3:31).

                       The Jews used the term "law" to refer to the entire body of
                    God's revelation through Moses. They called the first five books
                    of the Old Testament the law (the Torah). They held the per-
                    verted notion that the way to keep this law was to keep it as the
                    rabbis had prescribed. They accused Paul of preaching against
                    the law. (See Acts 21:28.)
                       While Paul opposed the oral traditions of the Jews, he never
                    spoke against the Scriptures themselveS. In this passage in the
                    book of Romans he makes the emphatic statement that faith
                    does not make void what God has revealed. In fact faith estab-
                    lishes the Torah as being true.

                      To what incident in the law did Paul point as proof of his
                    statement that faith establishes the law? Rom. 4:1-5.

                       The chapter divisions in the Bible were inserted arbitrarily
                    many centuries after the Bible was written. Actually chapter four
                    is an illustration of the assertion of chapter 3:31, showing that
                    faith as the ground of justification was already a theme of the
                    law. The chapter division here is misleading.
                       In the Torah is the narrative of Abraham. According to this
                    narrative Abraham was accounted righteous because he "be-
                    lieved God." Therefore the Torah itself teaches righteousness
                    by faith, Hence any implication that faith makes void (Greek
                    katargeo "renders useless," "invalidates") the law is com-
                    pletely false because faith affirms that which the Torah teaches.

                      To what other Old Testament scripture did Paul appeal as
                    supporting his thesis of faith? Rom. 4:6-8.

                       Paul cites Psalm 32:1, 2. He sets forth David's restoration to
                    divine favor after his affair with Bathsheba as an example of
                    justification by faith. It certainly wasn't any works that David
                    performed that won him acceptance. Forgiveness was an act of
                    God's grace. Here, then, was another example from the Torah of
                    the operation of faith. (Torah was often used of the Holy Scrip-
                    tures generally on the principle that the most important gave its
                    name to the whole; see John 10:34; 12:34.)
                       In view of Paul's use of "law" in this context, is Romans 3:31 a
                    good text to prove that the Ten Commandments are still binding
                    in the Christian era? Definitely. This is the application of the text
                    today, when Jewish law is no longer an issue. This is the way
                    Ellen White repeatedly uses this verse.

Justification and the Law         LESSON 5                              ❑ Monday
                                                                        January 28
           Part 2  Why is it that one trying to earn justification will fail of
    GRACE OR DEBT achieving it?

                     "Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of
                   grace, but of debt. But to him that worketh not, but believeth on
                   him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righ-
                   teousness" (Rom. 4:4, 5).

                       So long had the Jews believed that justification or acceptance
                    with God resulted from a meticulous keeping of the Torah, that
                    they found it difficult to grasp the glorious truth that justifica-
                    tion was granted as a free gift of grace to all who believed. It was
                    not a debt God owed them for law keeping.
                       One's relationship with God is affected by the way he under-
                    stands justification. If he believes he must earn acceptance, his
                    thinking is turned inward toward self-effort. If he grasps the
                    glorious truth that justification is a gift from God, his center of
                    focus becomes God.

                      In what way did the experience of Abraham demonstrate
                    that the Gentiles were eligible for eternal life? Rom. 4:9-12.

                       It was difficult for the Jews to accept the fact that the uncir-
                    cumcised Gentiles had equal status with them before God. Paul
                    appealed to the law they revered as teaching that justification is
                    in no way dependent upon whether a man is circumcised and
                    that it is freely available to all men regardless of race.
                       "The sinner must come in faith to Christ, take hold of His
                    merits, lay his sins upon the Sin Bearer, and receive His pardon.
                    It was for this cause that Christ came into the world. Thus the
                    righteousness of Christ is imputed to the repenting, believing
                    sinner. He becomes a member of the royal family."—Selected
                    Messages, bk. 1, p: 215.
                        When Abraham was justified (Gen. 15:6), he was not cir-
                    cumcised. Later he was circumcised. Thus Abraham became
                     uniquely the father of both the uncircumcised and the circum-
                     cised.

                    should lead me to abandon it?

                      "And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell
                    on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times
                    before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation" (Acts
                    17:26).
                       "In that age of caste, when the rights of men were often
                    unrecognized, Paul set forth the great truth of human brother-
                    hood, declaring that God 'hath made of one blood all nations of
                    men for to dwell on all the face of the earth.' In the sight of God
                    all are on an equality."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 238.

Justification and the Law        LESSON 5                           ❑ Tuesday
                                                                    January 29
          Part 3     In what sense is "law" used in the following scripture?
        PROMISE
        AND LAW      "For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world,
                   was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but
                   through the righteousness of faith" (Rom. 4:13).

                      "Promise" and "law" are here contrasted. Paul is seeking to
                   establish an Old Testament base for his teaching of righteous-
                   ness by faith. He finds an example in Abraham, whom all the
                   Jews accepted as their ancestor. Acceptance or justification
                   had come to Abraham quite apart from law. God made a prom-
                   ise to Abraham that he was to be "heir of the world." Abraham
                   believed this promise, that is, he accepted the role that it im-
                   plied. As a result God accepted him and worked through him to
                   save the world.
                      "There was given to Abraham the promise, especially dear to
                   the people of that age, of a numerous posterity and of national
                   greatness: 'I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless
                   thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing.'
                   [Gen. 12:2.] And to this was added the assurance, precious
                   above every other to the inheritor of faith, that of his line the
                   Redeemer of the world should come: 'In thee shall all families of
                   the earth be blessed.' [Gen. 12:3.]"—Patriarchs and Prophets,
                   p. 125.

                     With reference to the promise to Abraham, at what time was
                   the law introduced? Gal. 3:7-9, 14-17.

                      Four hundred and thirty years from the time the promise was
                   given to Abraham brings us to the establishment of the Israelite
                   economy at Sinai. While it is true that the Ten Commandments
                   were spoken by God Himself from Sinai's heights, this incident
                   was not their origin. The moral law is as old as God Himself. God
                   said to Abraham, "Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my ...
                   laws" (Gen. 26:5).
                      Therefore "law" in this Galatian passage cannot refer to the
                   moral law per se. It refers to the whole system of laws given at
                   Sinai which were the basis of the old covenant. It was to this
                   covenant that the Jews looked for salvation. Thus "law" in this
                   Galatian passage is loosely synonymous with "old covenant."
                   The moral law is included in—in fact is the base of—the old
                   covenant, but to single it out is to imply that the moral law
                   originated at Sinai.
                      This definition of law as the Jewish system is important to
                   grasp, because certain groups of evangelical Christians brand
                   as a legalist anyone teaching that the moral law should be
                   observed. But these Christians misread Paul, who was simply
                   trying to say that with the coming of the Messiah men could not
                   be saved under Judaism.

Justification and the Law        LESSON 5                         ❑ Wednesday.
                                                                    January 30
          Part 4     What circumstance would make faith of none effect?
    LAW AND OLD
       COVENANT      "If they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and
                   the promise made of none effect" (Rom. 4:14).

                     If men could be saved by keeping the Jewish laws there would
                   be no need for "faith," the element which Paul was presenting
                   as the ground of salvation. But the case of Abraham proved that
                   heirship came through promise not through law. Therefore, if
                   the Jews wished to be saved, they would have to abandon trust
                   in their works for salvation and accept the Abrahamic promise,
                   now fulfilled in the coming of the Messiah.

                     How did Paul explain the seeming contradiction between
                   "law" to which the Jews looked for life and the promise ac-
                   cording to which a man becomes an heir through faith? Gal.
                   3:21-23.

                      The law, or old-covenant experience, was necessary in order
                   to teach the Jews their need of a Saviour, to show them that
                   without God's power they could never meet His requirements.
                      "If the Abrahamic covenant contained the promise of re-
                   demption, why was another covenant formed at Sinai? In their
                   bondage the people had to a great extent lost the knowledge of
                   God. . . .
                      " ... Living in the midst of idolatry and corruption, they had no
                   true conception of the holiness of God, of the exceeding sinful-
                   ness of their own hearts, their utter inability, in themselves, to
                   render obedience to God's law, and their Reed of a Saviour. All
                   this they must be taught."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 371.
                      The problem was, as mentioned earlier, that the Jews never
                   fully learned the lesson the old covenant was designed to teach.
                   But when the Messiah came—or, as Paul says, when "faith
                   came"—they could no longer avoid a decision.

                   of experience today?

                     "The principle that man can save himself by his own works lay
                   at the foundation of every heathen religion. . . . Wherever it is
                   held, men have no barrier against sin."—The Desire of Ages, pp.
                   35, 36.
                     "If Satan can succeed in leading man to place value upon his
                   own works as works of merit and righteousness, he knows that
                   he can overcome him by his temptations, and make him his
                   victim and prey. . . . Strike the door-posts with the blood of
                   Calvary's Lamb, and you are safe."—Ellen G. White, Review and

Justification and the Law           LESSON 5                           ❑ Thursday
                                                                        January 31

            Part 5  How is the keeping of the law of God related to justification?
          ETHICAL
         CONDUCT    "And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as
      UNDER GRACE some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come?
                   whose damnation is just" (Rom. 3:8).

                       "What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law,
                     but under grace? God forbid" (Rom. 6:15).

                       There are a number of texts in Romans that seem to speak
                     depreciatingly of law keeping. For example, Romans 3:20.
                     "Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be
                     justified in his sight." But we have already pointed out that the
                     expression "law" as used in Paul's day was a much broader
                     term, including various laws (see lesson 2, especially for Tues-
                     day). When "law" is spoken of historically, the term becomes
                     almost synonymous with "Judaism" or "old covenant."
                       But it comes out clearly in the book of Romans that the
                     justified person leaves off his sinning. Paul was slanderously
                     accused of teaching that it was proper for the Christian to sin,
                     that, in fact, by sinning the Christian would give God's grace an
                     opportunity for broader demonstration. Paul emphatically de-
                     nied this charge. Chapters 6 to 8 emphasize living a life of
                     victory over sin. Thus a life of obedience to the law of God is the
                     fruit of justification.
                       The law of God is also related to justification in another way,
                     as we have earlier pointed out.
                       In justification Christ's perfect law keeping is imputed to the
                     sinner. "Righteousness is obedience to the law. The law de-
                     mands righteousness, and this the sinner owes to the law; but
                     he is incapable of rendering it. The only way in which he can
                     attain to righteousness is through faith. By faith he can bring to
                     God the merits of Christ, and the Lord places the obedience of
                     His Son to the sinner's account."—Selected Messages, bk. 1, p.
                     367.
                       But the fact that the obedience of Christ is imputed to the
                     account of a person in justification does not free him from
                     future obedience to the law of God. In fact it obligates him all the
                     more. The atonement was made precisely because the law
                     could not be abrogated or altered.
                        "In order for man to be saved, and for the honor of the law to
                     be maintained, it was necessary for the Son of God to offer
                     Himself as a sacrifice for sin. He who knew no sin became sin for
                     us. He died for us on Calvary. His death shows the wonderful
                     love of God for man, and the immutability of His law."—

Justification and the Law         LESSON 5                                 Friday
                                                                       February 1
          Part 6    What contrast did Paul draw to emphasize that salvation
        LAW AND could no longer be found in Judaism?
  TRANSGRESSION
                    "Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there
                 is no transgression. Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by
                 grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not
                 to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the
                 faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all" (Rom. 4:15, 16).

                      The Jews were so wedded to their Torah, "law," that Paul
                   found it difficult to wean them away from it. "The Jews had
                   always prided themselves upon their divinely appointed ser-
                   vices, and many of those who had been converted to the faith of
                   Christ still felt that since God had once clearly outlined the
                   Hebrew manner of worship, it was improbable that He would
                   ever authorize a change in any of its specifications."—The Acts
                   of the Apostles, p.. 189.
                      Surely it should have been evident to the Jews in Paul's day
                   that their law (Torah) was not saving them. In the first place, "the
                   law worketh wrath" (Rom. 4:15), and while professing to keep it,
                   they were treasuring up wrath to themselves against the day of
                   wrath (Rom. 2:5). But grace is related to faith, not to law. (See
                   Rom. 4:16.)
                      Furthermore, as a nation they had already experienced much
                   wrath for all their sins. Since God had revealed Himself in a
                   special way to theJews, committing to them His oracles, expect-
                   ing them to share this knowledge with the other nations, they
                   carried a special responsibility. When they failed not only in this
                   responsibility but also in their personal lives, the nation suffered
                   repeated reverses and captivities.
                      The history of the Jews was written "for our admonition, upon
                   whom the ends of the world are come" (1 Cor. 10:11). The Jews
                   suffered wrath because they failed to fulfill God's purpose for
                   them. Today the Christian church has been called to evangelize
                   the world. How effectively is it fulfilling its responsibility?

             Part 1   As a result of our having been justified by faith, what is our
             PEACE new relationship with God?
           AND JOY
                      "Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God
                    through our Lord Jesus Christ" (Rom. 5:1).

                         "Being justified" is literally "having been justified." The Greek
                     verb represents the action as completed. We have been de-
                     clared righteous, or regarded as righteous, not through any
                     deeds of law but through our having accepted Jesus Christ. The
                     perfect life that Jesus lived on this earth has been imputed to us.
                     God regards that we did the deeds of Jesus. His perfect law-
                     keeping is credited to us. At the same time, all of our sins have
                     been laid on Jesus. God has reckoned that Jesus did them. They
                     have been paid for by the death of the Son of God. What more
                     glorious news could there be for the sinner?
                         In Romans 5:1 a number of Greek manuscripts read, "let us
                     have peace," instead of "we have peace." Some translations
                     reflect the earlier reading. Either reading fits the context. If "let
                     us have peace" is accepted, it suggests an appeal to step into
                     the glorious experience that God designed for the justified
                     person. Because it sounds too good to be true, the newly jus-
                     tified person needs encouragement to believe it and act upon it.

                      Being at peace With God, what will be the justified sinner's
                     emotional response? Rom. 5:2.

                       Joy and rejoicing are frequent themes of Bible writers, both in
                     the Old Testament and in the New. No greater exultation can be
                     found than the joy that follows justification. With it the shallow
                     joys of illegitimate pleasure cannot be compared.
                        Here "the hope of the glory of God" probably has reference to
                     the future glory to be revealed at the end of the age. Then this
                     hope spoken of by Paul is the same as the "blessed hope, and
                     the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus
                     Christ" (Titus 2:13).
                        "There is great need that Christ should be preached as the
                     only hope and salvation. When the doctrine of justification by
                     faith was presented ... , it came to many as water comes to the
                     thirsty traveler. The thought that the righteousness of Christ is
                     imputed to us, not because of any merit on our part, but as a free
                     gift from God, seemed a precious thought."—Selected Mes-

THINK IT THROUGH       Unless I have experienced the peace that comes through
                     justification, how enthusiastically and convincingly can I
                     share with others the good news?

Blessings of Justification       LESSON 6                              ❑ Monday
                                                                       February 4
           Part 2  For the justified person, what besides hope is a ground for
    FORTITUDE IN rejoicing?
     TRIBULATION
                   "We glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation
                  worketh patience" (Rom. 5:3).

                      The Greek word translated "glory" in verse 3 is the one trans-
                   lated "rejoice" in verse 2. If it is translated "rejoice" in verse 3
                   also as in the Revised Standard Version, the connection be-
                   tween verses 2 and 3 is more clearly seen. A justified person can
                   rejoice in tribulation because he has fixed his faith and trust in
                   Jesus Christ. He has confidence that God will work all things for
                   good. He will consider it an honor to suffer for Christ's sake.
                   (See 1 Peter 4:13.)
                      "Trial is part of the education given in the school of Christ, to
                   purify God's children from the dross of earthliness. It is because
                   God is leading His children that trying experiences come to
                   them. Trials and obstacles are His chosen methods of disci-
                   pline, and His appointed conditions of success. He who reads
                   the hearts of men knows their weaknesses better than they
                   themselves can know them. He sees that some have qualifica-
                   tions which, if rightly directed, could be used in the advance-
                   ment of His work."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 524.
                      "They [God's servants] are joyful in the tribulation which they
                   experience while pressed by the enemy. These willing servants
                   are gaining an experience and forming a character which will
                   do honor to the cause to God."—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 510.

                    What progression will be seen in the person living in grace?
                   Rom. 5:3-5.

                      Patience. The Greek word thus translated (hupomone")
                   means steadfast endurance. This is the type of endurance that
                   tribulation develops in the one who maintains his faith, and who
                   does not lose sight of his hope of the glory of God. The opposite
                   type of experience is described by Ellen White as follows: "As
                   soon as God proves them, and tests their faith, they waver, they
                   stand feebly, swaying first one way, then the other. They have
                   not the genuine article that Paul possessed, that could glory in
                   tribulation because 'tribulation worketh patience.' "—
                   Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 514.
                      Experience. The Greek word thus translated (dokirne) means
                   literally "the quality of being approved," hence "character,"
                   that is "approved character." Tests patiently or steadfastly en-
                   dured develop an approved character.
                      Hope. Endurance and approval naturally give rise to hope.

              Part 3     Who took the initial step in reconciling man to God?
                GOD
        SEEKING MAN      "When we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died
                       for the ungodly.... But God commendeth his love toward us, in
                       that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us" (Rom.
                       5:6-8).

                          When Adam and Eve shamefully and inexcusably trans-
                       gressed the divine requirement, God took the first steps toward
                       reconciliation. Ever since, God has taken the initiative in provid-
                       ing a way of salvation and in inviting men to accept it. "When the
                       fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son" (Gal. 4:4).
                       On the cross Christ bore the sins of the whole world, past,
                       present, and future. Any man can have all his sins remitted
                       simply by turning from his sins and accepting Him.

                         From what does justification guarantee that a man will be
                       saved? Rom. 5:9.

                         Wrath—ultimate separation from God and annihilation—is
                       the terrible fate that awaits the sinner. (See Rom. 1:18.) The third
                       angel's message describes in the most fearful terms the wrath
                       that will fall upon the worshipers of the beast. (See Rev. 14:9-
                       11.) As the blood on the doorposts of the Israelites in Egypt on
                       the eve of their departure protected the firstborn from the wrath
                       that befell Egypt's firstborn, so the blood of Jesus Christ
                       guarantees that one who has been justified and retains that
                       status will be protected when God's wrath finally destroys sin.

                        Whereas Christ's death effects reconciliation, what does
                       Christ's life accomplish? Rom. 5:10.

                         Some commentators have seen in this passage of Scripture a
                       reference to the life that Christ lived on this earth during which
                       He wrought a perfect character which He now offers to impute
                       to us. While this is certainly what Christ's perfect life ac-
                       complished, Paul seems to be emphasizing the fact that
                       whereas Christ died, He rose again and is alive forevermore.
                       (See Heb. 7:25.) Because He lives, we are saved. If He had
                       remained in the tomb, our hopes would have perished with Him.

                         Mentioning for the third time in the present chapter the
                       Christian's joy, what new grounds of rejoicing does Paul cite?
                       Rom. 5:11.

                         This is the only time in the New Testament of the King James
                       Version that the word "atonement" occurs. The word is used
                       here in its literal sense of reconciliation.

Blessings of Justification       LESSON 6                         ❑ Wednesday
                                                                    February 6
         Part 4   What tragic results followed Adam's transgression and
         DEATH why?
  SWALLOWED UP
                  "Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and
                death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all
                have sinned" (Rom. 5:12).

                      Death is an enemy. When God created the human family He
                   designed that its members should live forever. With few excep-
                   tions men do not want to die. They cling tenaciously to life.
                   Death seldom comes without accident or through painful, lin-
                   gering diseases. No wonder people dread to die.
                      One of the most glorious aspects of the gospel is the news
                   that death has been swallowed up in life. Jesus passed through
                   the portals of the tomb and burst its bonds. He says, "I am he
                   that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am.alive for evermore,
                   Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death" (Rev. 1:18).
                   Because Jesus has the keys, the enemy can no longer hold his
                   victims in the grave.
                      Commentators have argued more over this passage of Scrip-
                   ture than over most others. Perhaps the reason is, as the S.D.A.
                   Bible Commentary, volume 6, page 529, says, that these com-
                   mentators "attempt to use the passage for purposes other than
                   Paul intended."
                      One point they argue over is, In what way was Adam's sin
                   passed on to his posterity? Did Adam's descendants share the
                   guilt of Adam's sin, or are they guilty before God because of
                   their own sin?
                      While these may be interesting questions to raise, it is doubt-
                   ful that Paul was here intending to clarify these deeply theologi-
                   cal issues. More likely he is reemphasizing what he has already
                   stated, "for all have sinned" (Rom. 3:23), Adam being the first
                   sinner. Men need to recognize that they are sinners. Only as
                   they recognize this will they see their need of a Saviour.
                       "Many are deceived concerning the condition of their hearts.
                    They do not realize that the natural heart is deceitful above all
                    things, and desperately wicked. They wrap themselves about
                    with their own righteousness, and are satisfied in reaching their
                    own human standard of character."—Selected Messages, bk. 1,

                   God made He him;' but man, after the Fall, 'begat a son in his
                   own likeness, after his image.' While Adam was created sinless,
                   in the likeness of God, Seth, like Cain, inherited the fallen nature
                   of his parents."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 80.

              Part 5     Why does Paul introduce the thought that "sin is not im-
       LAW AWAKENS     puted when there is no law"?
              NEED
                         "Until the law sin was in the world; but sin is not imputed
                       when there is no law. Nevertheless death reigned from Adam
                       to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the
                       similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him
                       that was to come" (Rom. 5:13, 14).

                           The phrase "until the law" is paralleled with the statement
                        "from Adam to Moses." The law here spoken of is the system
                        introduced by Moses at Sinai, which instituted the Jewish
                       economy. In Galatians 3:17 it is stated that the "law" came 430
                       years after the promise to Abraham, which again brings us to
                       the time of the Exodus.
                           "Until the law" means until the detailing of God's require-
                       ments in the various laws given to Israel at Sinai. Some might
                       argue that until God thus fully revealed His will, He could not
                       hold men responsible for transgressing that will. Sinning "after
                       the similitude of Adam's transgression" means sinning against
                       a known, expressly stated requirement. It is true that prior to
                       Sinai the human race generally had only a limited revelation of
                       God. Of course Abraham and his descendants had a much
                       greater knowledge, but they comprised only a minute fraction
                       of the pre-Sinai world. Nevertheless the people in that world
                       died, as Paul here points out. Death passed upon all men.
                       Though they had not sinned against an expressly revealed
                       command, yet they had sinned. They had the revelations of God
                       in nature, to which they had not responded and thus were held
                       guilty. "The invisible things of him from the creation of the
                       world are clearly seen . . . ; so that they are without excuse"
                       (Rom. 1:20).

                         For what purpose did God reveal Himself more fully in the
                       "law"? Rom. 5:20, 21.

                          The instruction given at Sinai included the moral law, though
                       it had existed before. But this was the first time, according to
                       the Bible, that this law was written and widely proclaimed. This
                       law was amplified in various statutes, judgments, and laws.
                          When the Israelites began to compare themselves with the
                       divine requirements, they discovered that they fell far short. In
                       other words, "the offense" abounded. They suddenly realized
                       the extent of their transgressions. The purpose of such a revela-
                       tion was to help them to see their need of a Saviour and to drive
                       them to accept the grace so freely offered by God.

           Part 6     What contrast does Paul make between Adam and Christ?
         CHRIST
    VERSUS ADAM       "Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all
                    men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one
                    the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life. For as
                    by one man's disobedience many were made sinners so by
                    the obedience of one shall many be made righteous" (Rom.
                    5:18, 19).

                       "As related to the first Adam, men receive from him nothing
                    but guilt and the sentence of death. But Christ steps in and
                    passes over the ground where Adam fell, enduring every test in
                    man's behalf. He redeems Adam's disgraceful failure and fall by
                    coming forth from the trial untarnished. This places man on
                    vantage ground with God. It places him where, through accept-
                    ing Christ as his Saviour, he becomes a partaker of the divine
                    nature. Thus he becomes connected with God and Christ."—

                       "The second Adam was a free moral agent, held responsible
                    for His conduct. Surrounded by intensely subtle and misleading
                    influences, He was made less favorably situated than was the

                      How are Adam's and Christ's acts contrasted in Romans
                    5:15-17?

                       The word "gift" occurs five times in verses 15 through 17.
                    Paul is emphasizing that justification is not earned; it comes as
                    a gift. (Compare Rom. 4:15; 6:23.) Men receive it by believing on
                    Jesus, which means fixing the faith or trust on Jesus Christ,
                    accepting Him for who He is, and accepting His plan for their
                    lives. This was such a new thought to the Jews that Paul needed
                    to give it emphasis. They had been taught that God's favor must
                    be earned by diligent attention to all God's requirements. Paul
                    was not saying that accepting justification as a gift gives the
                    receiver a right to ignore God's moral requirements. In sub-
                    sequent chapters he tells them that meeting the moral stan-
                    dards is possible only for one who is justified.

             Part 1   Having observed that "where sin abounded, grace did much
          GRACE IS more abound" (Rom. 5:20), how did Paul forestall the possible
        NOT LICENSE conclusion that sin is a good thing because it provides an
                    opportunity for grace to be operative?

                       "What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that
                     grace may abound? God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to
                     sin, live any longer therein?" (Rom. 6:1, 2).

                        "God forbid" (Greek me genoito) is a strong negation mean-
                     ing literally "may it not be," or "may it not become." The KJV
                     translation "God forbid" is an idiomatic translation, substitut-
                     ing for the Greek idiom an English idiom signifying strong
                     negation. The Greek phrase does not have the word "God."
                        Paul follows an interesting line of argument in chapter 6 as to
                     why a justified person should not sin. We should note it care-
                     fully. To begin with he says, we shouldn't sin because we have
                     died to sin. Then he explains what he means.

                        What aspect of water baptism signifies that the one bap-
                     tized leaves off sinning? Rom. 6:3-5.

                        Immersion in the waters of baptism represents burial. What is
                     buried? The "old man" of sin—that is, the body committing sin,
                     or the body dominated or ruled by sin. As a result this "body of
                     sin" is destroyed so that we no longer serve sin. In Romans 6 sin
                     is personified as a master who rules over his servants. Once the
                     "body of sin" that served Mr. Sin is destroyed, sin's mastery
                     over it ceases. The one who rises from the watery grave comes
                     up a new person who no longer serves Mr. Sin. He now walks in
                     newness of life.

                       What further lessons does baptism teach? Rom. 6:8-11.

                        The important point in these verses is that Christ, having died,
                     died once and for all. He is now alive forevermore. Death can no
                     more rule Him. So the Christian who is baptized has died to sin
                     once and for all and should never again come under its domin-
                     ion.
                        "At our baptism we pledged ourselves to break all connection
                     with Satan and his agencies, and to put heart and mind and soul
                     into the work of extending the kingdom of God.... The Father,
                     the Son, and the Holy Spirit are pledged to cooperate with

                                                                        February 11

          Part 2      By what figure is sin further described?
             SIN
     PERSONIFIED      "Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye
                    should obey it in the lusts thereof" (Rom. 6:12).

                       The word "reign" shows that "sin" is here represented as a
                    king. The Greek word here translated "reign" means, literally,
                    "to be a king," or "to function as a king." Mr. Sin is all too willing
                    to assume kingship of our mortal bodies and dictate their be-
                    havior.
                       When Paul says "let not sin . . . reign," he implies that the
                    justified person can choose to prevent Mr. Sin's setting himself
                    up as king in the life. This is where the action of the will comes
                    in.
                       "What you need to understand is the true force of the will.
                    This is the governing power in the nature of man, the power of
                    decision, or of choice. Everything depends on the right action of
                    the will. The power of choice God has given to men; it is theirs to
                    exercise. You cannot change your heart, you cannot of yourself
                    give to God its affections; but you can choose to serve Him. You
                    can give Him your will; He will then work in you to will and to do
                    according to His good pleasure. Thus your whole nature will be
                    brought under the control of the Spirit of Christ; your affections
                    will be centered upon him, your thoughts will be in harmony
                    with Him."—Steps to Christ, p. 47.
                       The Greek word translated "lusts" means "desires." So far as
                    the word itself is concerned, the desires may be either for good
                    things or for bad things. When Mr. Sin reigns he will make us
                     desire all kinds of evil things. These desires will be strong and
                     almost irresistible. We will want to do the things King Sin
                     suggests. The writer of the hymn "My Jesus I Love Thee" speaks
                     of the "pleasures of sin" which, in the Seventh-day Adventist
                    Church Hymnal, number 276, have been changed to "follies of
                     sin." It is true, they are follies. Nevertheless, King Sin offers
                     pleasures in which his subjects will strongly desire to indulge.
                       The "therefore" in this verse is important. It goes back to what
                     has been said before, specifically to what has been said in
                     verses 10 and 11. The baptized person is now living "unto God."
                     That is, God is the center of his new life. He is serving God, doing
                     what pleases God. Since this is the case, he cannot serve King
                     Sin at the same time. He is "alive unto God through Jesus
                     Christ." Notice how the Father and the Son are closely as-
                     sociated in the work of redemption. Often in gospel preaching
                     only Christ is exalted. The Father ought not thus to be ignored.
                     In the Pauline writings the Father and the Son are given equal
                     honor and attention.

               Part 3      What determines whether sin will reign over us?
          GRACE AND
            VICTORY        "Sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under
                         the law, but under grace" (Rom. 6:14).

                             This verse is one of the key statements in the book of Romans.
                           To understand it correctly we must know what Paul here means
                           by the expression "under the law." We have already pointed out
                           that in the context of the book of Romans "law" is used in its
                           wider application of the body of law delivered to the Jews at
                          Sinai. In many of its occurrences "law" is synonymous with
                          "Jewish economy" or "the old covenant." The moral law was a
                          part of this system, but the meaning of "law" in Romans must
                          not be restricted to "moral law"; otherwise we will have Paul
                          saying that the moral law originated at Sinai, which is not true.
                             Paul is saying in Romans 6:14 that the person living "under
                          the law," that is, under the Jewish economy as it functioned in
                          his day, will be ruled by sin. He will not have victory over sin.
                          Paul has already stated this clearly in chapter 2. (See Rom. 2:1,
                          21-24.) Now he repeats it in another context for further em-
                          phasis.
                             But a person living under grace will have victory over sin.
                          Accepting Jesus Christ as the Messiah, being justified by Him,
                          being baptized into His death, having the "old man" destroyed,
                          rising to walk in newness of life—these are the things that will
                          dethrone King Sin so that he will no longer reign.
                             But cannot the phrase "urtder the law" be interpreted to mean
                        , "under condemnation of the moral law"? This is an application
                          we may make of this verse today. But first we must understand
                          what the words of Paul meant to those who first heard them.
                          Then we may draw lessons for our own times. As Seventh-day
                          Adventists have applied this text, they have taught that "under
                          the law" means "under condemnation of the law." This has
                          been their answer to those who have claimed from this text that
                          the moral law has been abolished.

THINK IT THROUGH          How did Jesus demonstrate that victory over sin is possi-
                        ble?

                           "He [Jesus] did not consent to sin. Not even by a thought did
                        He yield to temptation. So it may be with us. Christ's humanity
                        was united with divinity; He was fitted for the conflict by the
                        indwelling of the Holy Spirit. And He came to make us partakers
                        of the divine nature. So long as we are united to Him by faith, sin
                        has no more dominion over us. God reaches for the hand of faith
                        in us to direct it to lay fast hold upon the divinity of Christ, that
                        we may attain to perfection of character."—The Desire of Ages,

                    possible victory over sin.
                       Having personified sin as a king ruling over his subjects, Paul
                    now returns to the figure of sin as a master demanding obedi-
                    ence of his servants. Paul points out that a person has a choice
                    of masters. He does not have to serve Mr. Sin. He can serve Mr.
                    Righteousness. It is foolish to serve Mr. Sin because that kind of
                    service results in death.
                       The vacuum created by leaving off sinning is filled with posi-
                    tive righteousness. Here the obedience is described as directed
                    toward doctrine. Doctrine means teaching. The Roman Chris-
                    tians had been taught the principles of the Christian faith, which
                    they now obeyed. Doctrine plays an important role in the salva-
                    tion process. It must never be depreciated.
                       "A profession of Christianity without corresponding faith and'
                    works will avail nothing. No man can serve two masters. The
                    children of the wicked one are their own master's servants; to
                    whom they yield themselves servants to obey, his servants they
                    are, and they cannot be the servants of God until they renounce
                    the devil and all his works. It cannot be harmless for servants of
                    the heavenly King to engage in the pleasures and amusements
                    which Satan's servants engage in, even though they often re-
                    peat that such amusements are harmless. God has revealed
                    sacred and holy truths to separate His people from the ungodly
                    and purify them unto Himself. Seventh-day Adventists should
                    live out their faith."—Testimonies, vol. 1, p. 404.

                      How does Paul further describe a change of masters? Rom.
                    6:18.

                       Until conversion or until being justified, all men are servants
                    of Mr. Sin. Then when they come under faith they are freed from
                    the cruel master they have served. But this does not leave them
                    free to do as they choose. They immediately choose a new
                    master and obey him.

 THINK IT THROUGH     In my struggles against temptation, how often am I moti-
                    vated by the reasons for not yielding that Paul gives in the
                    passages above? Would a strong determination not to be-
                    come again a servant of the cruel Mr. Sin help me gain the
                    victory?

     CONSECRATION
                     "I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of
                   your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to
                   uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield
                   your members servants to righteousness unto holiness"
                   (Rom. 6:19).

                       "After the manner of men." Paul wishes to mention some
                    specifics that normally he would not wish to mention. But be-
                    cause of the weakness of the flesh, the frailties of human nature,
                    he decides to spell them out.
                      Uncleanness is impurity. Sexual impurity is here implied. In
                    the service of Mr. Sin the sex organs have been used to commit
                    various forms of unlawful deeds, including perversion. Paul had
                    already called attention to these in chapter 1:24-32.
                      The Greek word translated "iniquity" literally means "law-
                    lessness." It is this word that is translated "transgression of the
                    law" in the King James Version of First John 3:4. The parts of the
                    body—the hands, the feet, the eyes, the ears, the mouth—had
                    been used to perform all kinds of lawless deeds in the service of
                    Mr. Sin.
                      Now, Paul says, as all of these organs and parts of the body
                    were dedicated to the service of Mr. Sin, so now they are to be
                    dedicated to the service of Mr. Righteousness.

THINK IT THROUGH      If the eyes are used to feast upon pornographic portrayals
                    and literature, to whose service are they dedicated? If the sex
                    organs are gratified in any way otherwise than God designed,
                    to whose service are they dedicated?

                       Long before the dawn of our permissive era and long before
                    the theater entered our living rooms via the TV, Ellen White said
                    concerning the theater: "Among the most dangerous resorts
                    for pleasure is the theater. Instead of being a school of morality
                    and virtue, as is so often claimed, it is the very hotbed of immor-
                    ality. Vicious habits and sinful propensities are strengthened
                    and confirmed by these entertainments. Low songs, lewd ges-
                    tures, expressions, and attitudes, deprave the imagination and
                    debase the morals. Every youth who habitually attends such
                    exhibitions will be corrupted in principle. There is no influence
                    in our land more powerful to poison the imagination, to destroy
                    religious impressions, and to blunt the relish for the tranquil
                    pleasures and sober realities of life than theatrical amuse-
                    ments."—Testimonies, vol. 4, pp. 652, 653.
                      If Ellen White thus characterized the theater of her time, what
                    evaluation would she place upon the movies and entertainment
                    programs in today's television?

Victory Over Sin      LESSON 7                                          ❑ Friday
                                                                      February 15

         Part 6    How did Paul sum up his illustration of the two masters, one
         WAGES or the other of which every member of the human race
     VERSUS GIFT serves?

                      "The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life
                    through Jesus Christ our Lord" (Rom. 6:23).

                       A master is expected to pay his servants wages. Mr. Sin (sin is
                    personified in Romans 6) pays wages to those who serve him.
                    His wages are death. Who would work for such wages? No one
                    in his right mind would be expected 10. But, deceived by Satan,
                    almost the entire human race is foolishly serving Mr. Sin.
                       How does Mr. Righteousness reward those who serve Him?
                    He doesn't even call His reward wages. He calls it a gift freely
                    bestowed upon those who choose Him as master.
                       Romans 6:23 is often quoted to show that the penalty for
                    sin—that is, the transgression of the law—is death. Certainly
                    sin's penalty is death. But in addition to seeing death as sin's
                    penalty, we should see sin as Paul describes it in Romans 6—as
                    a master dominating his servants, duping them by paying them
                    off with the ridiculous wages of death.

                      What contrast is made between the service of those who
                    serve Mr. Sin and that of those who serve Mr. Righteousness?
                    Rom. 6:20-22.

                      In his development of the figure of the two masters, Paul calls
                    attention to the fact that the service of one master means free-
                    dom from the service of the other. Thus this passage becomes a
                    powerful appeal to anyone who is serving Mr. Sin. This tyrant
                    offers nothing but death as pay for doing shameful things;
                    therefore, a reasonable person should desire emancipation
                    from such service. Those who serve Mr. Righteousness do
                    things that are upright and praiseworthy, not with the idea of
                    thus earning their salvation, but as a fruit of their new experi-
                    ence. The reward comes as a gift. This gift principle is illustrated
                    in Christ's parable of the workmen in the vineyard. (See Matt.
                    20:1-16.) No matter how long he worked, each workman re-
                    ceived the same amount.         '

 THINK IT THROUGH     Is it possible to serve Mr. Sin and Mr. Righteousness at
                    the same time? (See Matt. 6:24.) Does Mr. Sin object?

                      "Double-minded men and women are Satan's best allies.
                    Whatever favorable opinion they may have of themselves, they
                    are dissemblers. All who are loyal to God and the truth must
                    stand firmly for the right because it is right."—Ellen G. White

                                                                        February 17
             Part 1   What difference does deliverance from the law make in the
         DELIVERED type of service we render to God?
      FROM THE LAW
                      "Now we are delivered from the law, that being dead
                    wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of
                    spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter" (Rom. 7:6).

                         To understand Romans 7 one must understand what Paul
                      means by the term "law." In verse 7 Paul quotes from the law:
                      "Thou shalt not covet." Since this in one of the precepts of the
                      Decalogue, some have concluded that Paul is here speaking of
                      the moral law. He says "the law is holy, and the commandment
                      holy, and just, and good" (verse 12). This statement, too, fits the
                      moral law.
                         But is the moral law something from which the Christian is
                      delivered, as verse 6 says? Hardly. It is necessary to give to
                      "law" here the broader meaning to which we have already
                      referred, namely that "law" here means the system of Judaism
                      introduced at Sinai 430 years after the promise to Abraham.
                     (See Gal. 3:17.)
                        The argument between Paul and the Jews centered on this
                      point: "How is it that what God gave to the Jews as an integral
                      part of being saved is no longer valid?"
                        The moral law was the basis of Jewish economy and of the old
                     covenant. Hence the moral law is involved in Romans 7. Espe-
                     cially, as we draw lessons for ourselves today from Romans 7,
                     we should think of the moral law.
                        As has been repeatedly pointed out in our study of the book of
                     Romans thus far, the permanence of the moral law was never an
                     issue between Paul and the Judaizers. The moral law is as
                     permanent as God Himself. When Paul was speaking of people
                     being delivered from the "law," he certainly did not mean the
                     moral law. He meant deliverance from Judaism as the way of
                     salvation.
                        After a person is delivered from the law, he no longer serves in
                     the oldness of the letter—trying to keep all the multitudinous
                     precepts of the ancient system as a ground of salvation—but in
                     newness of spirit, led by the Holy Spirit. This point is developed
                     in chapter 8.
                        "Paul desires his brethren to see that the great glory of a
                     sin-pardoning Saviour gave significance to the entire Jewish
                     economy. He desired them to see also that when Christ came to
                     the world, and died as man's sacrifice, type met antitype.
                        "After Christ died on the cross as a sin offering the ceremo-
                     nial law could have no force. Yet it was connected with the
                     moral law, and was glorious. The whole bore the stamp of
                     divinity, and expressed the holiness, justice, and righteousness

Oldness of the Letter       LESSON 8                                   ❑ Monday
                                                                      February 18

          Part 2    What illustration does Paul use to prove that the law of
    ILLUSTRATION which he was speaking has limited jurisdiction over man?
  FROM MARRIAGE
                    "Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the
                 law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he
                 liveth? For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the
                 law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be
                 dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband" (Rom. 7:1, 2).

                      Paul's illustration in Romans 7:1-6 is somewhat involved, but
                   a careful analysis of the passage will help us to follow his
                   reasoning.
                      In yesterday's lesson we established the point that the law of
                   which Paul is here speaking is the system of worship estab-
                   I ished at Sinai. The Jews had difficulty grasping the fact that this
                   system, given to them of God, should come to an end with the
                   coming of the Messiah. The illustration Paul is here using was
                   designed to help them to see this point.
                       A woman is married to a man. The law binds her to him as long
                   as he lives. During his lifetime she cannot consort with other
                   men without being branded as an adulteress. But when he dies,
                   she is free from that law that bound her to her husband (verse 3).

                     How does Paul apply the illustration of the law of marriage
                   to the system of Judaism? Rom. 7:4, 5.

                     This is a difficult passage, but the general idea is clear. As the
                   death of her husband delivered the woman from the law of her
                   husband, so the death of the old life in the flesh, through Jesus
                   Christ, delivers the Jew from the law he had been expected to
                   keep until the Messiah fulfilled its types.
                     Now the Jews were free to remarry. They were invited to marry
                   the risen Messiah and thus bring forth fruit to God.
                     This illustration was one more device Paul used to convince
                   the Jew that he was now free to abandon the ancient system.

THINK IT THROUGH     How can I refute the antinomian who uses Romans 7:1-7
                   to prove that the Ten Commandments were nailed to the
                   cross?

                     "God's people, whom He calls His peculiar treasure, were
                   privileged with a two-fold system of law; the moral and the
                   ceremonial. The one, pointing back to creation to keep in re-
                   membrance the living God who made the world, whose claims
                   are binding upon all men in every dispensation, and which will
                   exist through all time and eternity. The other, given because of
                   man's transgression of the moral law. . . . Each is clear and
                   distinct from the other."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A.

Oldness of the Letter       LESSON 8                                  ❑ Tuesday
                                                                      February 19
          Part 3  Having mentioned that the "law" was temporal, and that the
         LAW'S Christian has been delivered from it, how did Paul proceed to
       FUNCTION show that "law" performed an important function?

                    "What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I
                  had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust,
                  except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet" (Rom. 7:7).

                     We must keep in mind again the sense in which Paul is using
                  the term "law." As explained in the lesson for Sunday, the sense
                  is that "law" is the system of worship introduced at Sinai. The
                  moral law was the basis of this system. Hence Paul could quote
                  from it as well as from any other section of it. However, when the
                  system passed away at the death of Christ, the moral law con-
                  tinued in force. In fact, it became the basis also of the new
                  covenant.

                    In what way is sin dead without the commandment? Rom.
                  7:8-11.

                      God revealed Himself to the Jews, telling them in detail what
                   was right and what was wrong in moral, civil, ceremonial, and
                   health matters. He also explained the penalties for violating the
                   various laws. Violation of the revealed will of God is here de-
                   fined as sin.
                      Thus, Paul explains, he would not have known it was a sin to
                   covet without having been informed of that fact by the "law."
                      Since sin is the violation of the revealed will of God, where the
                   revealed will is unknown, there is no awareness of sin. Hence
                   there is no awareness of condemnation to death, and the per-
                  son ignorantly living contrary to that revealed will is described
                  as being alive; whereas sin, being unable to condemn, is de-
                  scribed as being dead. When that revealed will is made known
                  to a person, he comes to recognize that he is a sinner and is
                  under condemnation and death. In this sense he dies.
                      In his line of argument here and throughout this section, Paul
                  is trying to build a bridge to lead the Jew, who reveres the "law,"
                  to Christ. He is showing that the "law" was necessary, but that
                  its function was limited, and more was needed.
                      In this section Paul is relating his own experience of coming
                  under conviction. "The apostle Paul, in relating his experience,
                  presents an important truth concerning the work to be wrought
                  in conversion. He says, 'I was alive without the law once'—he
                  felt no condemnation; 'but when the commandment came,'
                  when the law of God was urged upon his conscience, 'sin
                  revived, and I died.' Then he saw himself a sinner, condemned
                  by the divine law. Mark, it was Paul, and not the law, that
                  died."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary,

Oldness of the Letter       LESSON 8                             ❑ Wednesday
                                                                  February 20
          Part 4     In what way did Paul show his reverence for the law?
    LAW EXALTED
                     "Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy,
                   and just, and good" (Rom. 7:12).

                     Paul has declared the Christian to be "delivered from the law"
                   (verse 6). Because the Jews revered the law, he exalts it in every
                   way possible. He is saying this in Romans 7: The law is good in
                   every way, but man needs Jesus Christ.
                     This verse is frequently quoted by Seventh-day Adventists as
                   describing specifically the moral law, and correctly so, if it is
                   remembered that, when this is done, an application is made of
                   this passage to our own time and condition. Speaking to us
                   today, this passage exalts the moral law.

                    Whom does Paul blame for his condition of "death," and
                   whom does he exonerate? Rom. 7:13.

                     In this verse both "sin" and "law" are personified. Paul is
                   trying to present the "law" in the best sense possible. He
                   chooses to blame Mr. Sin, not Mr. Law, for his terrible sinful
                   condition—his working "all manner of concupiscence [lust]"
                   (verse 8). Using the good Mr. Law as a standard of conduct, Mr.
                   Sin showed Paul up to be a terrible sinner.

                     Why was sin so successful in showing up Paul as a terrible
                   sinner? Rom. 7:14, 15. •

                     Carnal means fleshly. Paul needed Jesus Christ. Only Jesus
                   Christ could take away the condemnation (Rom. 8:1). Only
                   Jesus Christ could free him from slavery to sin. Paul needed to
                   be born again.
                     Paul describes himself as "sold under sin." He is a slave to
                   sin. He has no freedom. He can't do what he wants to do. He tries
                   to do what the good law tells him to do, but sin won't let him.
                   What a terrible enslavement!
                      By this illustration Paul was trying to show the Jew his need of
                   the Messiah. He had already told him that victory is possible
                   only under grace (Rom. 6:14). This same thought is reem-
                   phasized in Romans 7. Living under the "law" means enslave-
                   ment to Mr. Sin, who is a merciless master.

THINK IT THROUGH     What is the danger in hiding behind a verse such as Romans
                   7:15 as an excuse for sinning?

                     "There is no safety nor repose nor justification in transgres-
                   sion of the law. Man cannot hope to stand innocent before God,
                   and at peace with Him through the merits of Christ, while he
                   continues in sin."—Selected Messages, bk. 1, p. 213.

Oldness of the Letter        LESSON 8                                 ❑ Thursday
                                                                      February 21

           Part 5   What is implied in Paul's continuing to sin, despite his best
         SLAVERY efforts to do right?
          TO SIN
                    "If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law
                  that it is good. Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that
                  dwelleth in me" (Rom. 7:16, 17).

                       Using the law as a mirror, the Holy Spirit convicts a person
                    that he is displeasing God by not fulfilling the requirements of
                    the law. By his efforts to meet those requirements the sinner
                    shows that he agrees that the law is good.
                       To win the Jew, Paul was doing his utmost to present the
                    "law" in the best possible light. Paul's inability to do right was
                    not the law's fault but sin's fault.

                     What points that Paul had already made did he repeat for
                    emphasis? Rom. 7:18-20.

                     To impress upon a person his need of Christ, the Holy Spirit
                   often leads him through an "old-covenant" type of experience.
                   Ellen White describes Israel's experience as follows:
                     "The people did not realize the sinfulness of their own hearts,
                   and that without Christ it was impossible for them to keep God's
                   law; and they readily entered into covenant with God. Feeling
                   that they were able to establish their own righteousness, they
                   declared, 'All that the Lord hath said will we do, and be obe-
                   dient.' Ex. 24:7.... Only a few weeks passed before they broke
                   their covenant with God, and bowed down to worship a graven
                   image. They could not hope for the favor of God through a
                   covenant which they had broken; and now, seeing their sinful-
                   ness and their need of pardon, they were brought to feel their
                   need of the Saviour revealed in the Abrahamic covenant."—
                   Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 371, 372.

THINK IT THROUGH     What is the reason many people believe Romans 7 de-
                   scribes a Christian's normal experience?

                      Unfortunately, by failing to renew their dedication to Christ
                   daily, many Christians are, in effect, serving Mr. Sin. However,
                   they would be the last to admit this. They rationalize that in
                   reality they are undergoing the normal experience of sanctifica-
                   tion and that they simply still have a long way to go. Thus,
                   instead of taking known sins to Christ and asking Him for victory
                   over them, they hide behind Romans 7, which tells them, they
                   think, that it is impossible to do right. In reality, this chapter is
                   saying that it is impossible to do right when a person is enslaved
                   to Mr. Sin, but victory is possible in Jesus Christ.

                                                                         February 22
            Part 6     How did Paul feel about being a slave to Mr. Sin?
   WRETCHEDNESS
  OF ENSLAVEMENT       "0 wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the
                     body of this death?" (Rom. 7:24).

                       The question, What is the body of this death? is best
                     answered from the context of this passage as discussed below.

                       What two elements within him were in conflict? Rom. 7:23.

                        The law in his members (the members are the parts of the
                     body, the organs) is equated with the law of sin. In reality it is the
                     law by which sin, his master, rules him. "With the flesh" Paul
                     says, he served "the law of sin" (Rom. 7:25). But serving sin and
                     obeying its law means death. (See Born. 7:10, 11, 13.) Hence his
                     body, made up of its members and organs, as it was now func-
                     tioning in obedience to sin, could fittingly be described as "the
                     body of this death."
                        The law of the mind is God's law, God's revelation of His will.
                     Under conviction of the Holy Spirit, Paul consented to this law.
                     His mind resolved to keep it, but when he tried, he couldn't.

                       How only can men and women be emancipated from slavery
                     to Mr. Sin? Rom. 7:25.

                        "Some have wondered why, after reaching the glorious
                     climax in the expression 'I thank God through Jesus Christ our
                     Lord,' Paul should refer once more to the struggles of the soul
                     from what he apparently had been delivered. Some understand
                     the expression of thanksgiving as a parenthetical exclamation.
                     They believe that such an exclamation follows naturally the cry,
                     'Who shall deliver?' They hold that before proceeding with an
                     extended discussion of the glorious deliverance (ch. 8) Paul
                     summarizes what he has said in the preceding verses and con-
                     fesses once again to the conflict against the forces of sin.
                        "Others suggest that by myself' Paul means, 'left to myself,
                     leaving Christ out of the picture.' "—S.D.A. Bible Commentary,
                     vol. 6, p. 558.
                        "Of ourselves we are no more capable of living a holy life than
                     was the impotent man capable of walking. There are many who
                     realize their helplessness, and who long for that spiritual life
                     which will bring them into harmony with God; they are vainly
                     striving to obtain it. In despair they cry, '0 wretched man that I
                     am! who shall deliver me from this body of death?' Rom. 7:24,

                                                                          February 24
             Part 1      For what group of people is there no condemnation?
     FREEDOM FROM
     CONDEMNATION       "There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are
                      in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the
                      Spirit" (Rom. 8:1).

                         "In Christ Jesus" is a common phrase in the Pauline writings.
                      For a person to be in Christ Jesus means that he has accepted
                      Christ as his Saviour. He trusts Him implicitly, and has decided
                      to make Christ's way of life his way. The result is a close per-
                      sonal union with Christ.
                         "In Christ Jesus" is contrasted with "in the flesh" (verse 8). It
                      is also contrasted with the experience detailed in chapter 7,
                      where Paul describes the person under conviction before his
                      surrender to Christ as carnal, that is, "in the flesh" and as "sold
                      under sin" (verse 14), meaning that he is a slave to sin. He is
                      under condemnation of death (verses 11,13,24). He serves the
                      "law of sin" (verses 23,25). He is in a terrible state of wretched-
                      ness (verse 24).
                         Then he surrenders to Jesus, and what a change is wrought!
                      The condemnation is gone! What a glorious redemption!
                         If you are using translations other than the King James Ver-
                      sion, you may find that the clause "who walk not after the flesh,
                      but after the Spirit" is missing. The reason for this is that certain
                      Greek manuscripts do not have this phrase. It is not lost, how-
                      ever, for it appears in all manuscripts in verse 4.

                        What frees a person from slavery to sin? Rom. 8:2.

                         "The law of the Spirit of life" here means Christ's plan for
                      saving man as contrasted with "the law of sin and death," which
                      was described in chapter 7 as the law by which Mr. Sin ruled
                      his subjects, the end of which was death. By contrast Christ's
                      law brings life and freedom.
                         "Every soul that refuses to give himself to God, is under the
                      control of another power. He is not his own. He may talk of
                      freedom, but he is in the most abject slavery.... While he flatters
                      himself that he is following the dictates of his own judgment, he
                      obeys the will of the prince of darkness. Christ came to break
                      the shackles of sin-slavery from the sou l."—The Desire of Ages,

Freedom in Christ       LESSON 9                                        ❑ Monday
                                                                       February 25
          Part 2    What was the law unable to accomplish? In what way did
  IMPORTANCE OF God supply the lack?
    INCARNATION
                    "What the law could not do, in that it was weak through the
                 flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh,
                 and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh" (Rom. 8:3).

                      "Law" is again used here of the system of Judaism. The Jews
                   readily accepted the revelation God gave them at Sinai and
                   entered into a covenant relationship with God.
                      Good as God's revelation is, no one can live up to it without
                   the help Christ provides. Yet many professed Christians try. We
                   call them moralists.
                      God provided a remedy by "sending his own Son in the like-
                   ness of sinful flesh," and He "condemned sin in the flesh." The
                   incarnation of Christ was an important step in the plan of salva-
                   tion. It is proper to exalt the cross, but in the outworking of the
                   plan of salvation Christ's life "in the likeness of sinful flesh" was
                   extremely important too.
                      "One honored of all heaven came to this world to stand in
                   human nature at the head of humanity, testifying to the fallen
                   angels and to the inhabitants of the unfallen worlds that
                   through the divine help which had been provided, every one
                   may walk in the path of obedience to God's commands. . . .
                      "Our ransom has been paid by our Saviour. No one need be
                   enslaved by Satan. Christ stands before us as our all-powerful
                   helper."—Selected Messages, bk. 1, p. 309.
                      "Satan represents God's law of love as a law of selfishness.
                   He declares that it is impossible for us to obey its precepts. The
                   fall of our first parents, with all the woe that has resulted, he
                   charges upon the Creator, leading men to look upon God as the
                   author of sin, and suffering, and death. Jesus was to unveil this
                   deception. As one of us He was to give an example of obedi-
                   ence. For this He took upon Himself our nature, and passed
                   through our experiences. 'In all things it behooved Him to be
                   made like unto His brethren.' Heb. 2:17. If we had to bear any-
                   thing which Jesus did not endure, then upon this point Satan
                    would represent the power of God as insufficient for us. There-
                   fore, Jesus was 'in all points tempted like as we are.' Heb. 4:15.
                   He endured every trial to which we are subject. And He exer-
                    cised in His own behalf no power that is not freely offered to us.
                    As man, He met temptation, and overcame in the strength given
                   Him from God.... His life testifies that it is possible for us also to
                    obey the law of God."—The Desire of Ages, p. 24.

              Part 3      As a result of God's sending His Son, what is now possible?
           ENABLING
             POWER      "That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us,
                       who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit" (Rom. 8:4).

                           In Greek we have a word for righteousness here different from
                        most of the earlier occurrences of "righteousness," for exam-
                        ple, in Romans 3:21. Note again the close connection in Greek
                        between key words in Romans, all built on the same root.
                           1. Dikaioo—to declare or regard as righteous. This is the
                        word commonly translated "justify."
                           2. Dikaiosune—righteousness from the point of view of the
                        quality of righteousness.
                           3. DikaiOrna—righteous requirement. This is the word that
                        occurs in Romans 8:4.
                           As a result of what God has done in sending Christ, it is now
                        possible for us to meet the righteous requirement of the law,
                        that is, to do the right things that the law requires. "Under the
                       law" (Rom. 6:14) this was impossible; "in Christ" it is possible.
                           "Those who are adopted into the family of God are trans-
                       formed by His Spirit. Self-indulgence and supreme love for self
                       are changed to self-denial and supreme love for God. No man
                       inherits holiness as a birthright, nor can he, by any methods that
                       he can devise, become loyal to God. 'Without me,' Christ says,
                       'ye can do nothing' (John 15:5). Human righteousness is as
                       'filthy rags.' But with God all things are possible. In the strength
                       of the Redeemer, weak, erring man can become more than
                       conqueror over the evil that besets him."—Selected Messages,
                       bk. 1, p. 310.
                           "Walk" is an idiomatic expression signifying "to conduct
                       oneself." "After" here has the Old English meaning "according
                       10." "Flesh" here denotes unregenerate man, whether before or
                       after conviction. To walk after the flesh is to be controlled by
                       selfish desires.
                           To walk after the Spirit is to fulfill the righteous requirement of
                       the law. Only through the help of the Holy Spirit can a man meet
                       this requirement. Only in Christ Jesus is there freedom to do
                       what the law requires. Apart from Christ there is no such free-
                       dom. The one who is enslaved to sin finds it impossible to do the
                       good he chooses to do. (See Rom. 7:15, 18.)

                         What part does the Spirit play in a Christian's walk "after the
                       Spirit"?

                         "Having brought conviction of sin, and presented before the
                       mind the standard of righteousness, the Holy Spirit withdraws
                       the affections from the things of this earth and fills the soul with
                       a desire for holiness."—The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 52, 53.

Freedom in Christ       LESSON 9                                   ❑ Wednesday
                                                                    February 27
          Part 4     What two classes of people are there in the world, and how
    TWO CLASSES    are they distinguished?
      OF PEOPLE
                     "They that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh;
                   but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit. For to
                   be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life
                   and peace" (Rom. 8:5, 6).

                     "After," here again, is used in the Old English sense of "ac-
                   cording to" (Greek kata).
                     "Mind" here means to set the mind on. The one group sets its
                   mind on fulfilling natural desires. The other group sets its mind
                   on the things of the Spirit, to follow His dictates. Since the set of
                   the mind determines actions, the two groups follow different
                   courses.

                     What is the carnal mind unable to do? Rom. 8:7, 8.

                      To have one's mind set on fulfilling the desires of the natural
                   heart is, in reality, a state of enmity against God. One whose
                   mind is thus set is unconcerned about doing the will of God. He
                   may even be in rebellion against God, openly flouting His law.
                      But the point that Paul wishes especially to emphasize is that
                   apart from Christ it is impossible to keep the law of God. Again
                   and again Paul returns to this point. No matter how hard one
                   tries, he cannot. (See Rom. 7:15, 18, 19.)
                      Paul's special purpose in the line of argument here was to
                   persuade the Jews that they needed more than their "Torah"
                   (law). By their conduct they had shown that in spite of having
                   the divine revelation they were guilty of the same sins of which
                   the Gentiles were guilty (chapter 2). The lesson of all this was
                   that they needed the Messiah. Without Him they would be slaves
                   of sin, unable to escape sin's dominion.
                      This was Paul's answer to the Jews who couldn't understand
                   why it was that what God had given them in the Old Testament
                   was not enough for salvation. Paul admitted it was all good, but
                   they also needed to accept the Messiah who had now come.
                      "By His life and His death, Christ proved that ... sin could be
                   forgiven, and that the law is righteous, and can be perfectly
                   obeyed."—The Desire of Ages, p. 762.

        EXPERIENCE
                      "Ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the
                    Spirit of God dwell In you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of
                    Christ, he is none of his" (Rom. 8:9).
                      "As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of
                    God" (Rom. 8:14).

                       The life "in the flesh" is contrasted with life "in the Spirit."
                     The life "in the Spirit" is a life controlled by the Spirit of God, the
                     Holy Spirit. He is here called the Spirit of Christ perhaps in the
                     sense that He is a representative of Christ and through Him
                     Christ dwells in the believer (verses 9, 10).

                        What will the Spirit that raised Jesus from the dead do for
                      the Christian whom He indwells? Rom. 8:10, 11.

                        Paul here returns to a figure he used in Romans 6:1-11.
                     Figuratively, in baptism "the body of sin," that is, the body that
                     served sin, is destroyed. The "old man is crucified with him"
                     (Rom. 6:6). "He that is dead is freed from sin" (Rom. 6:7). But as
                     in baptism there is not only a burial but also a resurrection, so
                     the person baptized rises to walk in newness of life.

                      Being made alive by the Spirit obligates a person to do
                     what? Rom. 8:12, 13.

                        "Mortify" means to put to death. Notice who it is that puts to
                     death the deeds of the body—it is "ye," the Christian himself.
                     Thus the salvation process is not all a God event; man must
                     cooperate. God does not destroy human freedom. Even after
                     the old man of sin is destroyed, it is still possible to sin. To the
                     Colossians Paul wrote, "Mortify [put to death] therefore your
                     members which are upon the earth" (Col. 3:5).
                        Thus after conversion there will still be a struggle against sin.
                     But the difference is that the person whom the Spirit indwells
                     now has available divine power for victory. Furthermore, since
                     he has been so miraculously freed from the slave master Sin, he
                     is obligated never to serve him again.

THINK IT THROUGH       How can one tell whether the Spirit of God Is dwelling in
                     him?

                        "The heart renewed by the Holy Spirit will bring forth 'the

           Part 6   How does Paul describe the new relationship In Christ of the
       ADOPTION one freed from slavery to sin?
 VERSUS BONDAGE
                    "Ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear;
                  but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry,
                  Abba, Father" (Rom. 8:15).

                      Negatively the new relationship is described as freedom from
                   fear. A slave is in bondage. lie lives in a state of constant fear
                   from his master. He stands to gain nothing from his long years
                   of service.
                      Not so the one who accepts Jesus Christ. First, he renders
                   voluntary service. Second, he serves without fear, for "perfect
                   love casteth out fear" (1 John 4:18). Third, adopted as a son, he
                   becomes an heir to an inheritance of infinite worth.
                      "The spirit of bondage is engendered by seeking to live in
                   accordance with legal religion, through striving to fulfill the
                   claims of the law in our own strength. There is hope for us only

                     What gives us the assurance that God has indeed accepted
                   us as children? Rom. 8:16.

                     The inward witness of the Spirit confirms our acceptance.
                   While it is not safe to go by feeling merely, the one who to the
                   best of his understanding has followed the light of the Word will
                   hear an inward authenticating voice assuring him that he has
                   been accepted as a child of God.

                      Becoming a child of God involves us In what kind of a
                    relationship with Christ? Horn. 8:17.

                      "The plan of salvation does not offer believers a life free from
                    suffering and trial this side of the kingdom. On the contrary, it

                    the most sinful out of the pit of degradation, and to place them
                    where they will be acknowledged as children of God, heirs with

   FOR THE JEWS
                      "I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my
                    brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh" (Rom. 9:3).

                       Remember Paul's purpose in the book of Romans. Among
                    other things he was trying to explain why God had largely turned
                    from the Jews and was now extending salvation to the Gentiles.
                    Had God gone back on His promises? the Jews wondered.

                      What special advantages had God extended in the past to
                    the Israelites? Rom. 9:4, 5.

                       God needed a missionary people to evangelize a world that
                    had gone into idolatry. He chose the Israelites and revealed
                    Himself to them. He planned that they become a model nation
                    and thus attract other peoples to a worship of the true God.
                       "It was God's purpose that by the revelation of His character
                    through Israel men should be drawn unto Him. To all the world
                    the gospel invitation was to be given. Through the teaching of
                    the sacrificial service Christ was to be uplifted before the na-
                    tions, and all who would look unto Him should live. .. . As the
                    numbers of Israel increased they were to enlarge their borders,

                    ject Lessons, p. 290.

                      How did Paul explain the apparent nonfulfillment of God's
                    promises? Rom. 9:6-12.

                       Paul is building a line of argument in which he will show that
                    the promise made to Israel has not completely failed. There
                    exists a remnant through whom God still aims to work.
                       To establish the validity of the remnant idea, Paul dips back
                    into Israelite history. He shows that God has always been selec-
                    tive: (1) God did not choose all the seed of Abraham to be His
                    covenant people, only the line of Isaac. (2) He did not choose all
                    of the descendants of Isaac, only those of Jacob.
                       Paul concludes, as chapter 9 develops, that the existence of
                    a remnant shows that the word of God has taken some effect.
                    It has not completely failed, as some might allege.

           Part 2     How can God's contrasting attitudes toward Jacob and
  GOD'S FREEDOM     Esau be explained?
      TO CHOOSE
                        "It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger. As
                    it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated" (Rom.
                    9:12, 13).

                      It is impossible properly to understand Romans 9 until one
                    recognizes that Paul is not speaking of individual election to
                    salvation. He is here. speaking of particular roles God was cap- •
                    ing upon certain people to play. God wanted Jacob to be the
                    progenitor of the people who would be His special evangelizing
                    agency in the world. There is no implication in this passage that
                    Esau could not be saved. God wanted him to be saved as much
                    as He desires all men to be saved. (See 1 Tim. 2:4.) In fact, as
                    pointed out in yesterday's lesson, Esau and his descendants
                    could have united themselves with the chosen people.

                      What does Paul once more warn against? Rom. 9:14.

                      "God forbid" is an idiomatic translation of a Greek phrase
                    denoting strong negation.

                      In what area is it that the choice is entirely God's? Rom.
                    9:15.

                      Paul is not here speaking of individual salvation, because in
                    that area God extends mercy to all, for He "will have all men to
                    be saved" (1 Tim. 2:4). "The grace of God that bringeth salvation
                    hath appeared to all men" (Titus 2:11). But God can choose
                    nations to play a role, and, while they can refuse to play that role,
                    they cannot prevent God's choice. No matter how hard Esau
                    may have willed it, He could not have become the progenitor of
                    the Messiah nor of the chosen people.

THINK IT THROUGH       When I am tempted to think that I have little choice in my
                    life's outcome, how can I reassure myself that in the vital area
                    of salvation I have a choice?

                      "There was no arbitrary choice on the part of God by which
                    Esau was shut out from the blessings of salvation. The gifts of
                    His grace through Christ are free to all. There is no election but
                    one's own by which any may perish. God has set forth in His
                    word the conditions upon which every soul will be elected to
                    eternal life—obedience to His commandments, through faith in
                    Christ. God has elected a character in harmony with His law,
                    and anyone who shall reach the standard of His requirement will
                    have an entrance into the kingdom of glory."—Patriarchs and

              Part 3    What does the experience of Pharaoh show with regard to
        EXAMPLE OF     God's freedom?
     GOD'S FREEDOM
                         "The scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same pur-
                       pose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee,
                       and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.
                       Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and
                       whom he will he hardeneth" (Rom. 9:17, 18).

                          In dealing with Egypt at the time of the Exodus in the manner
                       He did, God was working for the salvation of the human race.
                       God's revelation of Himself in the plagues of Egypt and in the
                       deliverance of His people was designed to reveal to the Egyp-
                       tians as well as to other nations that the God of Israel indeed was
                       the true God. It was designed to be an invitation for the peoples
                       of the nations to abandon their gods and to worship Him.
                          Obviously the Pharaoh who was on the throne at the time of
                       the Exodus had already made his choice against God, so that in
                       hardening his heart God was not cutting him off from the oppor-
                       tunity of salvation. The hardening was against the appeal to let
                       Israel go, not against God's appeal for Pharaoh to accept per-
                       sonal salvation.

                        What warning did Paul utter against criticism of the acts of
                       God? Rom. 9:19, 20.

                         "No finite mind can fully comprehend the character or the
                       works of the Infinite One. We cannot by searching find out God.
                       To minds the strongest and most highly cultured, as well as to
                       the weakest and most ignorant, that holy Being must remain
                       clothed in mystery. But though 'clouds and darkness are round
                       about Him: righteousness and judgment are the foundation of
                       His throne.' Psalm 97:2, R.V. We can so far comprehend His
                       dealing with us as to discern boundless mercy united to infinite
                       power. We can understand as much of His purposes as we are
                       capable of comprehending; beyond this we may still trust the
                       hand that is omnipotent, the heart that is full of love."—

THINK IT THROUGH          When tempted to question God's leading in my life, how can
                       I reassure myself that He has my best interests at heart?

                         "We have no reason to doubt God's word because we cannot
                       understand the mysteries of His providence. In the natural world
                       we are constantly surrounded with wonders beyond our com-
                       prehension. Should we then be surprised to find in the spiritual
                       world also mysteries that we cannot fathom? The difficulty lies
                       solely in the weakness and narrowness of the human mind."—

Redemption for Jew and Gentile              LESSON 10              ❑ Wednesday
                                                                       March 5
         Part 4    When the Israelites as the chosen people failed in fulfilling
   GOD CHOOSES their evangelizing role, whom did the Lord call to fulfill it?
    CHRISTIANS
                   "What if God, willing to chew his wrath, and to make his
                power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of
                wrath fitted to destruction: and that he might make known the
                riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore
                prepared unto glory, even us, whom he hath called, not of the
                Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?" (Rom. 9:22-24).

                      "Willing" here means "wishing" (Greek thelO). Although the
                   Jews, for their many failures to fulfill the divine purpose, had
                   suffered repeated reverses, God had not allowed them to ex-
                   perience total wrath, even though they deserved it.
                      "Fitted to destruction" means "ready for destruction." In His
                   freedom to do as He chooses, God had shown mercy toward the
                   Jews. If they did not object to God's mercy to them, they should
                   not object to God's further act in transferring to the Christian
                   church, made up of believing Jews and Gentiles, the role pre-
                   viously assigned to the chosen people.
                      This loss of their role many Jews found difficult to accept. But
                   the line of argument thus far in chapter 9 has been to show
                   God's right to make choices of peoples and groups to fulfill
                   specific roles.
                      Some people believe that in chapter 9 Paul lends support to
                   the doctrine of predestination, namely, that some persons are
                   elected to be saved, others to be lost. But this is not what Paul is
                   dealing with here. Every person living today has the right to be
                   saved, and all those who have lived in the past have had the right
                   to be saved. This includes Esau and the Pharaoh of the Exodus
                   whom Paul mentions. Paul is dealing with role assignments, not
                   with individual salvation. When this point is grasped, the diffi-
                   culty with Romans 9 vanishes.
                      Thus it is today. Every person is invited to be saved, but when
                   it comes to assigning his lifework, God in His freedom makes
                   the choice. He has designated a special place where each is to
                   labor for God. A person has the power to refuse to fill that role. If
                   he refuses, he must suffer the consequences.

THINK IT THROUGH      How may I discover the special role God wants me to ful-
                   fill?

                      "He [Christ] gives 'to every man his work.' Each has his place
                   in the eternal plan of heaven. Each is to work in co-operation
                   with Christ for the salvation of souls. Not more surely is the
                   place prepared for us in the heavenly mansions than is the
                   special place designated on earth where we are to work for
                   God."—Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 326, 327.

Redemption for Jew and Gentile             LESSON 10                ❑ Thursday
                                                                       March 6
           Part 5   What Scripture did Paul quote to support God's choice of the
       SCRIPTURE Christians to fulfill the role formerly assigned Israel?
        SUPPORT
                    "As he saith also In Osee [Hosea), I will call them my people,
                  which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not
                  beloved" (Rom. 9:25).
                     Paul quotes Hosea 2:23 in verse 25 and Hosea 1:10 in verse 26.
                   God instructed Hosea to take "a wife of whoredoms" (Hosea
                   1:2) as an illustration of God's relationship with Israel who had
                   gone a whoring after strange gods. The children born to this
                   marriage were given names signifying God's rejection and
                   punishment of idolatrous Israel. The third child was named
                   Lo-ammi (Hosea 1:8) meaning literally "Not my people."
                     Not to leave the people without hope, Hosea predicted the day
                   would come when, after punishing His people, God would re-
                   store their fortunes, take away their false gods, and make a
                   covenant with them. (See Hosea 2:11-19.) At this point those
                   who were Lo-ammi, "not my people," would become Ammi,
                   "my people."
                     In Paul's day the Ammi were the "even us ... not of the Jews
                   only, but also of the Gentiles" (Rom. 9:24).

                     Compared to the large number of Israelites, how large did
                   Isaiah predict would be the number saved? Rom. 9:27.
                     The fact that his kinsmen generally rejected the appeal of the
                   gospel gave Paul "great heaviness and continual sorrow" in his
                   heart (Rom. 9:2). But at least there was a remnant. God's prom-
                   ises have not failed.

                     What kind of work would God di:, upon the earth? Rom. 9:28.
                      In Romans 9:28 Paul quoted from Isaiah 28:22 in the Septua-
                   gint, which says that in a summary way God will deal with
                   Israel's problem. The Hebrew of this passage, as translated in
                   the KJV, reads as follows: "For I have heard from the Lord God
                   of hosts a consumption, even determined upon the whole
                   earth."
                      As we apply this verse today, we think of the summary work
                   that God will perform soon in the final judgment.

THINK IT THROUGH     When the Lord cuts His work short, does it mean that certain
                   people will not have the opportunity for salvation?
                     "The Lord God of heaven will not send upon the world His
                   judgments for disobedience and transgression until He has sent
                   His watchmen to give the warning. He will not close up the
                   period of probation until the message shall be more distinctly
                   proclaimed.... Yet the work will be cut short in righteousness."

Redemption for Jew and Gentile             LESSON 10                     ❑ Friday
                                                                          March 7
         Part 6      In the matter of attaining to righteousness, why was it that
    REASON FOR     the Jews failed but the Gentiles succeeded?
       FAILURE
                     "What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed
                   not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even
                   the righteousness which is of faith. But Israel, which followed
                   after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of
                   righteousness. Wherefore? Because they sought it not by
                   faith" (Rom. 9:30-32).

                      In words that cannot be misunderstood Paul explains to his
                   kinsmen why the'y are missing out on something God wishes
                   them to have; more than that, on something they were actually
                   pursuing but not achieving.
                      Interestingly, the Gentiles whom God had accepted had not
                   even been striving for such acceptance. They had been pursu-
                   ing their own interests and goals when the gospel message
                   came to them. Grasping its value, they accepted it. God de-
                   clared them righteous because they accepted Jesus Christ as
                   their substitute. It was a transaction of faith.
                      The problem with Israel was that they stumbled at the stum-
                   bling stone (verse 33). The vast majority refused to accept Jesus
                   of Nazareth as the Messiah whom God had sent. He did not meet
                   their expectations of the Messiah. What a loss they sustained!
                   Righteousness was offered them as a gift. They turned it down.

                     What Old Testament scripture did Paul quote as predicting
                   that acceptance of the Messiah would be a problem with some
                   people? Rom. 9:33.

                     Here was a text from the Old Testament (Isa. 28:16) which the
                   Jew revered, setting forth the importance of faith, the ingredient
                   missing in the experience of the majority of the Jews.

THINK IT THROUGH     What stumbling stones in my life prevent the surrender of
                   myself completely to the Messiah? Have I fully accepted righ-
                   teousness by faith?

                      "He [the rich young ruler] wanted the heavenly treasure, but
                   he wanted also the temporal advantages his riches would bring
                   him. He was sorry that such conditions existed; he desired
                   eternal life, but he was not willing to make the sacrifice. The cost
                   of eternal life seemed too great, and he went away sorrowful;
                   'for he had great possessions.' . . .
                        . . . Thousands are passing through this ordeal, weighing

             Part 1     To what did Paul attribute Israel's failure to find acceptance
     ZEAL WITHOUT     with God?
       KNOWLEDGE
                        "I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not
                      according to knowledge. For they being ignorant of God's
                      righteousness, and going about to establish their own righ-
                      teousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righ-
                      teousness of God" (Rom. 10:2, 3).

                         Paul is here speaking of Israel as a nation, not the individual
                      Israelite, many of whom accepted the Messiah and became the
                      nucleus of the Christian church.

                        What burden did Paul express again in Romans 10:1?

                         "In this letter [to the Romans] Paul gave free expression to his
                      burden in behalf of the Jews. Ever since his conversion, he had
                      longed to help his Jewish brethren to gain a clear understand-
                      ing of the gospel message. 'My heart's desire and prayer to God
                      for Israel is,' he declared, 'that they might be saved.'
                         "It was no ordinary desire that the apostle felt. Constantly he
                      was petitioning God to work in behalf of the Israelites who had
                      failed to recognize Jesus of Nazareth as the promised Messiah."
                      —The Acts of the Apostles, p. 374.

                        Of what is Christ the end? Rom. 10:4.

                         This verse has been variously explained. First we should seek
                      to understand what it means in its context. The Jews were
                      "going about to establish their own righteousness" (Rom. 10:3)
                      and seeking "the righteousness which is of the law" (Rom.
                      10:5).
                         They believed this righteousness could be obtained by dili-
                      gent law keeping. Paul even quotes Moses in support of such a
                      thesis, "That the man which doeth those things shall live by
                      them" (Rom. 10:5).
                         With the coming of the Messiah the true way of righteousness
                      was presented. Righteousness was offered to all who would fix
                      their faith in Christ. He was the one to whom the ancient cere-
                      monial system had pointed. When He came, He put an end to the
                      old system—the old covenant. In other words, Christ is the end
                      of the law or the system of Judaism. In Christ is reasserted the
                      truth that righteousness is of faith.
                         Some see in the word "end" (Greek telos) the meaning "ob-
                      jective." If this definition is adopted, Romans 10:4 means that
                      Christ is the goal or objective toward which the law points. The
                      system of Judaism was designed to lead to Christ.

                        How is righteousness achieved? Rom. 10:9, 10, 13.

Salvation for the Jews         LESSON 11                                ❑ Monday
                                                                         March 10
            Part 2     To what question did Paul express an emphatic denial?
    THE ELECTION
        OF GRACE        "I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For
                     I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of
                     Benjamin. God hath not cast away his people which he fore-
                     knew" (Rom. 11:1, 2).

                       In the first part of his answer to the question, "Hath God cast
                     away his people?" Paul points to a remnant, an election of
                     grace, as proof that God has not cast away His people. This
                     election of grace was the group from among the Jews that
                     accepted the Messiah. It should be remembered that the early
                     converts to Christianity were all Jews—for example, the group
                     that was converted on the Day of Pentecost. It took a special
                     vision and miracle to convince Peter that the Gentiles, too, had
                     equal access to the grace of Christ (Acts 15:7, 8; compare Acts
                     10) and that the gospel was to be carried to them as well.
                       But the existence of a remnant is only a part of Paul's answer
                     to the question as to whether God has cast away His people. In
                     the remainder of the chapter Paul develops a further idea.

                       What had happened to the vast majority of Israel? Rom.
                     11:7-10.

                        "Notwithstanding Israel's failure as a nation, there remained
                     among them a goodly remnant of such as should be saved. At
                     the time of the Saviour's advent there were faithful men and
                     women who had received with gladness the message of John
                     the Baptist, and had thus been led to study anew the prophecies
                     concerning the Messiah. When the early Christian church was
                     founded, it was composed of these faithful Jews who recog-
                     nized Jesus of Nazareth as the one for whose advent they had
                     been longing."—The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 376, 377.
                        Paul quotes frequently from the Old Testament—writings the
                     Jews accepted as authoritative. Verse 8 combines ideas from
                     Isaiah 6:9 and 29:10. Verses 9 and 10 are a quotation from Psalm
                     69:22, 23.
                        The Isaiah passages that Paul cites represent God as giving to
                     Israel a spirit of slumber, preventing their seeing and hearing.
                     Does God blind people's eyes to prevent them from seeing light
                     that would lead them to salvation? Never! These passages must
                     be understood in the light of our explanation of Romans 9 in last
                     week's lesson. Paul is not talking of individual salvation but of
                     the role of the nation of Israel. When as a nation Israel refused to
                      fulfill Heaven's purpose for her, God had a right to turn from the
                     Israelites to another people who would fulfill His purpose.

               Part 3      What good did God work out of the failure of the Israelites?
           FULLNESS
        OF THE JEWS       "I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God
                        forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the
                        Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy" (Rom. 11:11).

                            "Through the Jewish nation it was God's purpose to impart
                         rich blessings to all peoples. Through Israel the way was to be
                         prepared for the diffusion of His light to the whole world. The
                        nations of the world, through following corrupt practices, had
                        lost the knowledge of God. Yet in His mercy God did not blot
                        them out of existence. He purposed to give them opportunity for
                         becoming acquainted with Him through His church."—Christ's
                        Object Lessons, p. 286.
                            "The material advantages that Israel enjoyed were designed
                        to arrest the attention and catch the interest of the heathen....
                        Ambassadors from one foreign country after another would
                        come to discover, if they might, the great secret of Israel's
                        success as a nation, and its leaders would have the opportunity
                        of directing the minds of their visitors to the Source of all good
                        things.... For a graphic picture of how one nation would have
                        responded to the irresistible appeal radiating from an Israel
                        faithful to God, see Isa. 19:18-22; cf. Ps. 68:31."—S.D.A. Bible
                        Commentary, vol. 4, p. 29.
                            When the Israelites refused to fulfill the divine purpose, it
                        meant that the Gentiles were offered an opportunity to join
                        God's people. When God called the Christian church into exis-
                        tence, almost immediately the gospel invitation was extended
                        to the Gentiles. "Through their fall" means through God's rejec-
                        tion of the Israelites as His chosen people. Now salvation had
                        come to the Gentiles.
                           Immediately God turned the Gentiles' acceptance of the gos-
                        pel into further advantage. Through it He hoped to provoke the
                        Israelites to jealousy so that they too would seek for and find
                        salvation.

                          If the rejection of the chosen people as a nation had worked
                        to advantage, what would God's acceptance of the Israelites
                        accomplish? Rom. 11:12-15.

                           There are two expressions in this passage that are parallel: (1)
                        "their [the Israelites;] fulness" (verse 12); and (2) "the receiving
                        of them [the Israelites]" (verse 15). Paul envisioned the di-
                        minishing and the casting away to be only temporary to be
                        followed by fullness and reception. This is Paul's second an-
                        swer to the question raised at the beginning of this chapter,
                        "Hath God cast away his people?" What appears to be a casting
                        away, he says, is only a temporary situation.

Salvation for the Jews LESSON 11                                  ❑ Wednesday
                                                                     March 12
          Part 4     To what does Paul liken the remnant in Israel?
        GRAFTED
       BRANCHES      "If the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root
                   be holy, so are the branches. And if some of the branches be
                   broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in
                   among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness
                   of the olive tree" (Rom. 11:16, 17).

                      "Firstfruit" here refers to a part of a lump of dough, which
                   anciently was dedicated to God. (See Num. 15:19-21.)
                      Paul introduces another figure of speech—an olive tree.
                   "Paul likens the remnant in Israel to a noble olive tree, some of
                   whose branches have been broken off."—The Acts of the Apos-
                   tles, p. 377. Thus the tree represents Israel not including the
                   unbelieving Israelites. This illustration is used to prove that
                    "God hath not cast away his people': (verse 2). The root and
                   trunk are still there.
                      Into this tree the believing Gentiles have been grafted. But
                   they are drawing their sap and vitality from the root and trunk
                    which represent believing Israel.

                     Against what attitude were the Gentiles warned? Rom.
                   11:18-22.

                     What had happened to the Israelites could happen to believ-
                   ing Gentiles. The Bible teaches no doctrine of once saved,
                   always saved. Only those who "continue in his goodness" will
                   be saved.
                     No believer should boast of his own goodness or feel any
                   superiority over his fellow human beings. His salvation was not
                   earned; it was a gift. Hence no credit belongs to him.

                     What was Paul's hope regarding the branches which had
                   been broken off? Rom. 11:23, 24.

                     Paul is pointing to the possibility that the broken-off branches
                   could be grafted into the trunk from which they had been bro-
                   ken. In the expression of this possibility was an implied hope,
                   which Paul later turns into a prediction.

THINK IT THROUGH     In the interpretation of illustrations or parables, what prin-
                   ciples must be borne in mind?

                      One must not become overly literal in the interpretation of an
                   illustration. For example, in nature a severed branch, if it has
                   been disconnected from its parent stock for some time, could
                   not be expected to thrive if grafted back into the stock again.
                   But in the application it was possible for Jews who had been
                   rejected by God to be accepted through faith in the Messiah.

Salvation for the Jews            LESSON 11                               ❑   Thursday
                                                                              March 13
              Part 5    As Paul reaches the crux of his argument in Romans 11,
         A MYSTERY     what mystery does He reveal?
          REVEALED
                          "I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this
                       mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that
                       blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the
                       Gentiles be come in" (Rom. 11:25).

                          What Paul is here saying is in reply to the question raised at
                       the beginning of the chapter, "Rath God cast away his people?"
                       His answer, of course, is No, and his explanation is (1) that the
                       blindness (Greek pordsis, hardness) is only "in part," and (2)
                       that it is only temporary "until the fulness of the Gentiles be
                       come in."

                         When "the fulness of the Gentiles be come In," what is to
                       happen? Rom. 11:26, 27.

                           Two explanations have been given of these verses: (1) These
                        verses predict a large influx of Jews into the Christian faith. (2)
                        "All Israel" refers to spiritual Israel, the totality of those saved
                        from among Jews and Gentiles. (See S.D.A. Bible Commentary
                        on these verses.)
                           The context favors the first view, although the idea of a
                        spiritual Israel is certainly valid and will be fulfilled.
                           Paul has already anticipated a "fulness" for the Jews (verse
                       12) and a "receiving of them" (verse 15). Now in verses 26 and 27
                        he quotes Old Testament Scriptures. (See Isa. 59:20, 21; Jer.
                        31:33, 34) to show that something special was to happen when
                        the blindness would be removed.
                           "All Israel" must not be construed to mean every Israelite.
                       Nowhere do the Scriptures preach universalism, either for the
                       entire human race or for a particular segment. Paul was hoping
                       to save "some of them" (verse 14). The "all Israel" is here
                        contrasted with the remnant (verse 5). While a small remnant
                       had accepted the Messiah, the majority were blinded and hard-
                       ened. But when from this group large numbers would turn to the
                       Lord, then it could be said that "all Israel," not only the remnant
                        group Paul had mentioned, would be saved.
                           Commenting on Romans 11, Ellen White speaks of a time "in
                       the closing proclamation of the gospel" when "many of the
                       Jews" "will by faith receive Christ as their Redeemer."—The
                       Acts of the Apostles, p. 381.
                          "Among the Jews are some who, like Saul of Tarsus, are
                       mighty in the Scriptures, and these will proclaim with wonderful
                       power the immutability of the law of God. . . . As His servants
                       labor in faith for those who have long been neglected and
                       despised, His salvation will be revealed."—The Acts of the Apos-

                                                                      March 14
          Part 6     What was the attitude of the Jews toward the gospel?
     EVANGELISM
   FOR THE JEWS      "As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your
                   sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the
                   fathers' sakes. For the gifts and calling of God are without
                   repentance" (Rom. 11:28, 29).

                     The "they" were the ones who in Paul's day were opposing
                   the preaching of the gospel and were persecuting the church,
                   as before his conversion Paul himself had done. But God had
                   not given them up. The blindness would one day be removed,
                   and many would turn to the Lord. Thus God's election of the
                   Jews would yet stand.

                     Who are the "these" and the "they" mentioned in verse 31
                   and how is their experience contrasted with that of the believ-
                   ing Gentiles? Rom. 11:30, 31.

                      "In the closing proclamation of the gospel, when special work
                   is to be done for classes of people hitherto neglected, God
                   expects His messengers to take particular interest in the Jewish
                   people whom they find in all parts of the earth. As the Old
                   Testament Scriptures are blended with the New in an explana-
                   tion of Jehovah's eternal purpose, this will be to many of the
                   Jews as the dawn of a new creation, the resurrection of the soul.
                   As they see the Christ of the gospel dispensation portrayed in
                   the pages of the Old Testament Scriptures, and perceive how
                   clearly the New Testament explains the Old, their slumbering
                   faculties will be aroused, and they will recognize Christ as the
                   Saviour of the world. Many will by faith receive Christ as their
                   Redeemer. To them will be fulfilled the words, 'As many as
                   received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of
                   God, even to them that believe on His name.' John 1:12."—The
                   Acts of the Apostles, p. 381.

THINK IT THROUGH     What can I do to bring the gospel to Jewish people In my
                   vicinity?

                      "There is a mighty work to be done in our world. The Lord has
                   declared that the Gentiles shall be gathered in, and not the
                   Gentiles only, but the Jews. There are among the Jews many
                   who will be converted, and through whom we shall see the
                   salvation of God go forth as a lamp that burneth. There are Jews
                   everywhere, and to them the light of present truth is to be
                   brought. There are among them many who will come to the
                   light, and who will proclaim the immutability of the law of God
                   with wonderful power."—Evangelism, p. 578.

                                                                            March 16
              Part 1   With the doctrinal part of his letter being concluded, what
             LIVING does Paul begin to do?
         SACRIFICES
                       "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God,
                     that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable
                     unto God, which is your reasonable service" (Rom. 12:1).

                         With chapter 11 ends the doctrinal part of the book of Ro-
                      mans. Chapters 12 through 16 present practical instruction and
                      contain personal notes. Nevertheless, these concluding chap-
                      ters are also extremely important doctrinally, because they
                      show how the life of faith is to be lived.
                         Once a person is justified by faith apart from deeds of law, is
                      he still subject to the moral law? There are many dos and don'ts
                      in the life of faith. A relationship of love with Christ does not
                      guarantee that the believer will automatically bring forth good
                      fruit. Strong personal effort is still required.
                         The law of Christ, if one wishes to term New Testament in-
                      struction in that way, contains many dos and don'ts. This is
                      further proof of the fact that whatever Paul had said negatively
                      concerning law in this epistle, he had said with reference to the
                      obsolete Jewish system. The moral precepts are still all in force
                      and are explained and amplified in the New Testament. No
                      indication is given that it will be easy for the Christian to regu-
                      late his life by these moral precepts. He is promised divine
                      power and the assurance that victory is possible, but he is still in
                      the world of the enemy and will have to fight many a battle
                      against powerful temptations.
                         It is unfortunate that the antinomian has made so much of the
                      book of Romans. He declares Seventh-day Adventists to be
                      legalists because he has misinterpreted Romans, claiming that
                      the law from which the Christian has been delivered is the moral
                      law instead of the obsolete Jewish system. That is why a correct
                      understanding of the book of Romans is so important.
                         In Romans 12:1 Paul is alluding to Old Testament sacrifices.
                      As anciently animals were sacrificed to God, so now Christians
                      ought to yield their bodies to God, not to be killed, but as living
                      sacrifices dedicated to serve God.
                         "[Rom. 12:1 quoted.] In the time of ancient Israel every offer-
                      ing brought as a sacrifice to God was carefully examined. If any
                      defect was discovered in the animal presented, it was refused;
                      for God had commanded that the offering be 'without blemish.'
                      So Christians are bidden to present their bodies, 'a living sac-
                      rifice, holy, acceptable unto God.' In order to do this, all their
                      powers must be preserved in the best possible condition."—

Living the Life of Faith-1        LESSON 12                             ❑ Monday
                                                                         March 17
           Part 2     What is the basis of all true transformation?
   MIND RENEWAL
                      "Be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by
                    the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that
                    good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God." (Rom. 12:2).

                       Redemption is an intelligent process in all of its stages. The
                    mind is the seat of action. There will be no change in behavior
                    unless there is first a change in thinking.
                      If the Christian wishes to pattern his life according to the will
                    of God, he must first ascertain what that will is. This is a mental
                    process. But it is more than an intellectual process. An action of
                    the will is involved. There must be a yielding to Jesus Christ.
                       "The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God:
                    for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them,
                    because they are spiritually discerned" (1 Cor. 2:14).
                       "In the Bible the will of God is revealed. The truths of the Word
                    of God are the utterances of the Most High. He who makes these
                    truths a part of his life becomes in every sense a new creature.
                    He is not given new mental powers, but the darkness that
                    through ignorance and sin has clouded the understanding is
                    removed. The words, 'A new heart also will I give you,' mean, 'A
                    new mind will I give you.' A change of heart is always attended
                    by a clear conviction of Christian duty, an understanding of
                    truth. He who gives the Scriptures close, prayerful attention will
                    gain clear comprehension and sound judgment, as if in turning
                    to God he had reached a higher plane of intelligence."—My Life
                    Today, p. 24.

                      What is the secret of harmonious relationships between
                    fellow Christians? Rom. 12:3-8.

                      If each Christian would recognize his gifts and seek to per-
                    form his service within the orbit of these gifts, and would cease
                    competing with others, there would be much greater harmony
                    in the church of God.
                       "Many do not become what they might, because they do not
                    put forth the power that is in them. They do not, as they might,
                    lay hold on divine strength. Many are diverted from the line in
                    which they might reach the truest success. Seeking greater
                    honor or a more pleasing task, they attempt something for
                    which they are not fitted."—Education, p. 267.

                    "Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil;
                  cleave to that which is good. Be kindly affectioned one to

                    the Spirit, Paul exalts love. Love (Greek agape) is the more
                   excellent way. "God is love" (1 John 4:8). Therefore love is the
                   character of God. To love is to act toward others as God acts, to
                   treat them as God treats them. The New Testament has two
                    words in the Greek translated "to love." When distinguished in
                    meaning, agapao is the love which is principle, whereas philed
                    is the emotional love that exists between close friends and
                    between members of a family. Christians are admonished to
                   agapac3, not to philed. For example, they are admonished to
                    love their enemies. (See Matt. 5:44.) This is possible because the
                    word is agapad. Christians are to treat their enemies as God
                   would treat them. It would be impossible to find toward them the
                   same strong emotional feeling that one feels, for example,
                   toward his spouse or his closest friend, and this is not required.
                       One might raise the question, Are the New Testament dos and
                   don'ts any easier to keep than the Old Testament moral and
                   ceremonial regulations? We may not wish to answer this ques-
                   tion with a direct Yes or No. But several points are worth noting.
                       1. The reason the Old Testament regulations had become
                   such a yoke of bondage was that with their traditions the Jews
                   had so embellished God's simple commands that it became
                   almost impossible to keep them. Shorn of these embellish-
                   ments, they are probably no more difficult than the New Testa-
                   ment precepts.
                       2. God's salvation and power were available in Old Testa-
                   ment times by faith just as in New Testament times, although the
                   Jews were not availing themselves of God's provisions and
                   hence fell down in moral behavior. (See Romans 2.)
                       3. While motivations for proper moral behavior might be ex-
                   pected to be the same in both eras, there is the added factor that
                   in New Testament times the Messiah had come. He had iden-
                   tified Himself with the human race. He had given a demonstra-
                   tion of what God is like. He had paid the infinite price for man's
                   redemption. These were now accomplished facts instead of
                   anticipated events. Men found it easier to understand God and
                   to enter into a personal relationship with Him through Jesus
                   Christ.

                                                                      March 19
           Part 4   What is to be the Christian's attitude toward civil govern-
    RELATIONSHIP ment?
  TO GOVERNMENT
                    "Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there
                  is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of
                  God" (Rom. 13:1).

                       Read Romans 13:1-7. These verses define how a Christian
                   living the life of faith is to relate himself to the government of the
                   country in which he resides. He is to accept the civil authority as
                   God-ordained and should pay his taxes.
                       For a time after Israel left Egypt their civil laws were dictated
                   by God and mediated through a prophet—Moses. Today God
                   has delegated civil authority to the various governments of the
                   nations. Through them He is attempting to maintain a level of
                   freedom and protection for individual citizens.
                       God holds these governments responsible for the way they
                   administer justice. "Rulers are God's servants, and they are to
                   serve their time as His apprentices. It is for their good that they
                   faithfully follow the plain 'Thus saith the Lord,' keeping the way
                   of the Lord to do justice and judgment. They are to exercise
                   their powers without partiality and without hypocrisy, refusing
                   to be bought or sold,,scorning all bribes, and standing in moral
                   independence and dignity before God. They are not to connive
                   at one act of dishonesty or injustice."—Ellen G. White Com-
                    ments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1081.
                       Christians are to give loyal support to government so long as
                    its claims do not conflict with the claims of God.
                       "We are to recognize human government as an ordinance of
                    divine appointment, and teach obedience to it as a sacred duty,
                    within its legitimate sphere. But when its claims conflict with the
                    claims of God, we must obey God rather than men. God's word
                    must be recognized as above all human legislation. . . .
                       "We are not required to defy authorities. Our words, whether
                    spoken or written, should be carefully considered, lest we place
                    ourselves on record as uttering that which would make us
                    appear antagonistic to law and order. We are not to say or do
                    anything that would unnecessarily close up our way."—The
                   Acts of the Apostles, p. 69.

                   tics?

                     "The Lord would have His people bury political questions. On
                   these themes silence is eloquence. Christ calls upon His follow-
                   ers to come into unity on the pure gospel principles which are
                   plainly revealed in the word of God."—Gospel Workers, p. 391.

              Part 5   In his relationship with fellow human beings, what oblige-
      RELATIONSHIPS tion rests upon a Christian?
         TO OTHERS
                       "Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that
                     loveth another hath fulfilled the law" (Rom. 13:8).

                         We have already defined the type of love here required. (See
                      part 3.) It isagapad, the love which is a principle, which one can
                      make himself exercise. Since God is love, to love our fellow
                      human beings is to respect and treat them as God respects and
                      treats them. When we love others, we reflect God's character.
                         As did Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount, Paul here amplifies
                      the precepts of the law, showing that love must be the motivat-
                      ing power in law keeping. Since the law is a transcript of the
                      character of God, and God is love, then to love is to fulfill the
                      law.
                         Paul is here not substituting some vague standard of love for
                      the precisely detailed precepts of the law, as some Christians
                      claim. Antinomians claim that the law is done away with and that
                      all the Christian needs to be concerned with is love. But, accord-
                      ing to Paul, the moral law is still binding. However, as he points
                      out, it can be truly kept only in the context of love. The love
                      factor had been largely missing in the Jews' legalistic attitude
                      toward the law.

                        Which sample commandments did Paul cite to Illustrate the
                      principle of love in law keeping? Rom. 13:9, 10.

                        Interestingly, the love factor was not a newly introduced prin-
                      ciple. By quoting Leviticus 19:18, "Thou shalt love thy
                      neighbour as thyself," Paul showed that the principle was an
                      integral part of the Torah. Again Paul appealed to the Torah for
                      support for his gospel preaching.

                        Who besides Paul tied in the command "Love thy neighbour
                      as thyself" with commands from the second table? Matt.
                      19:18, 19.
                         "His [the young ruler's] conception of the law was external
                      and superficial. Judged by a human standard, he had preserved
                      an unblemished character. To a great degree his outward life
                      had been free from guilt; he verily thought that his obedience
                      had been without a flaw. Yet he had a secret fear that all was not
                      right between his soul and God."—Christ's Object Lessons, p.
                      391.
                         The young ruler's problem was that he loved self more than
                      his neighbor. "He professed to have kept the commandments,
                      but he was destitute of the principle which is the very spirit and
                      life of them all."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 392.

                                                                         March 21
           Part 6    To what circumstance did Paul point as calling for urgent
      MOTIVATION action?
       FOR RIGHT
          LIVING     "That, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out
                  of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we be-
                  lieved" (Rom. 13:11).

                      This is one of the few references in the book of Romans to the
                   nearness of the second advent. (Compare Rom. 16:20.) He has
                   spoken of "the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous
                   judgment of God" (Rom. 2:5). He is yet to mention the fact that
                   "we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ" (Rom.
                   14:10).
                      We must not judge from the paucity of references to the
                   nearness of the second advent that Paul regarded the time of
                   the advent a matter of minor importance. In the Thessalonian
                   and the Corinthian letters, for example, he deals with the matter
                   at some length. But in writing to the Romans he had one major
                   objective in mind—to clarify the gospel, particularly as it related
                   to the Jew-Gentile situation.
                      Paul took for granted that the Roman Christians knew the
                   time. This suggests that the second advent was an important
                   feature in New Testament instruction of converts. Speaking of
                   the coming antichrist, Paul said to the Thessalonian believers,
                   "Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told [Greek,
                    "kept tellingl you these things?" (2 Thess. 2:5).

                     How near did Paul represent the coming of Christ as being?
                    Rom. 13:12.

                       "The long night of gloom is trying, but the morning is deferred
                    in mercy, because if the Master should come, so many would be
                    found unready. God's unwillingness to have His people perish
                    has been the reason of so long delay."—Testimonies, vol. 2, p.
                    194.
                       "The Lord . . . is soon coming, and we must be ready and
                    waiting for His appearing. 0, how glorious it will be to see Him,
                    and be welcomed as His redeemed ones! Long have we waited,
                    but our hope is not to grow dim. If we can but see the King in His
                    beauty we shall be forever blessed. I feel as if I must cry aloud:
                    'Homeward bound!' We are nearing the time when Christ will

                    their eternal home."—Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 253.

                    live? Rom. 13:13, 14.

                   the least chance that a particular course of action may be
                   wrong, he avoids it.
                     Specifically, the subject under consideration is the eating of
                   meats that may have been sacrificed to idols. The Jerusalem
                   council (Acts 15) had dealt with this problem: "One was the
                   problem as to what attitude should be taken toward the use of
                   meats offered to idols. Many of the Gentile converts were living
                  among ignorant and superstitious people who made frequent
                   sacrifices and offerings to idols. The priests of this heathen
                   worship carried on an extensive merchandise with the offerings
                  brought to them, and the Jews feared that the Gentile converts
                   would bring Christianity into disrepute by purchasing that
                   which had been offered to idols, thereby sanctioning, in some
                  measure, idolatrous customs."—The Acts of the Apostles, p.
                  191. The council ruled that Gentile converts should refrain from
                  using such foods in their diet.
                     But there was always the question as to whether meats sold in
                  public markets had come from animals sacrificed to idols. (See
                  1 Cor. 10:25.) The "strong Christian" wouldn't bother to raise
                  the question; the overscrupulous Christian, if there were the
                  slightest doubt, chose to eat vegetables instead.
                     We should note that the subject under consideration is not
                  one of vegetarianism versus a flesh diet. This was not a New
                  Testament issue. Only in comparatively recent times has God
                  urged vegetarianism upon His people. This dietary peculiarity
                  must not be superimposed upon the New Testament church.
                     Nor is Paul implying in this passage that the distinction be-
                  tween clean and unclean meats has been abolished. This is not
                  the subject under consideration. The Bible must always be
                  interpreted in its context, and with reference to what the writer
                  is talking about. A few words must never be lifted out of the text
                  by themselves and a meaning placed upon them other than the
                  author intended them to have. For example, if the words "he
                  may eat all things" were taken to mean that now any animal,
                  clean or otherwise, could be eaten, they would be misapplied.
                  Comparison with other New Testament passages would rule
                  against such an application. To "receive" one weak in the faith
                  meant to accord him full membership and social status. He was
                  not to be argued with, but given the right to his opinion.

          Part 2  How was the "strong" Christian to relate to the over-
    SERVANTS OF scrupulous Christian, and how was the latter to regard the
     ONE MASTER former?

                     "Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let
                   not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath
                   received him" (Rom. 14:3).

                      Paul does not speak depreciatingly of the one who is "weak in
                   the faith." Nor does he give him advice as to how to become
                   strong. So far as God is concerned, the overscrupulous Chris-
                   tian (judged overscrupulous apparently not by God but by his
                   fellow Christians) is accepted. "God hath received him."

                    What important principle must a Christian constantly bear in
                   mind? Rom. 14:4.

                     Here is stated clearly the New Testament principle of the
                   priesthood of all believers—"to his own master he standeth or
                   falleth." Each one must go directly to his Master to inquire as to
                   his duty. No one else must be conscience for him.
                      Ellen White counsels: "I was shown the danger of the people
                   of God in looking to Brother and Sister White and thinking that
                   they must come to them with their burdens and seek counsel of
                   them. This ought not so to be. They are invited by their compas-
                   sionate, loving Saviour to come unto Him, when weary and
                   heavy-laden, and He will relieve them.... Many come to us with
                   the inquiry: Shall I do this? Shall I engage in that enterprise? Or,
                   in regard to dress, Shall I wear this or that article? I answer
                   them: You profess to be disciples of Christ. Study your Bible.
                   Read carefully and prayerfully the life of our dear Saviour when
                   He dwelt among men upon the earth. Imitate His life, and you
                   will not be found straying from the narrow path. We utterly
                   refuse to be conscience for you. If we tell you just what to do,
                   you will look to us to guide you, instead of going directly to
                   Jesus for yourselves."—Testimonies, vol. 2, pp. 118, 119.

THINK IT THROUGH     What can assure safe guidance for me?

                     "We are not to place the responsibility of our duty upon
                   others, and wait for them to tell us what to do. We cannot
                   depend for counsel upon humanity. The Lord will teach us our
                   duty just as willingly as He will teach somebody else.... Those
                   who decide to do nothing in any line that will displease God, will
                   know, after presenting their case before Him, just what course
                   to pursue."—The Desire of Ages, p. 668.

Living the Life of Faith-2       LESSON 13                            ❑   Tuesday
                                                                         March 25
          Part 3     What further reason does Paul set forth for not judging or
  ALL SUMMONED     despising a brother?
   TO JUDGMENT
                     "Why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at
                   nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment
                   seat of Christ" (Rom. 14:10).

                     If Christ is the judge, then what right have I to play that role?
                   Furthermore, since I must give an account before the judgment
                   seat of Christ, I do not wish to have recorded against me that
                   instead of loving my brother I despised and condemned him.

                    Of what significance is the statement from the Old Testa-
                   ment that Paul introduces here? Rom. 14:11.

                     The citation from Isaiah 45:23 supports the thought that all
                   must appear for judgment. "Every knee" and "every tongue"
                   individualizes the summons. The implication is that each one
                   will have to answer for himself (verse 12). No one can answer for
                   another. This solemn fact should banish any thought of
                   superiority over, or any desire to "straighten out," an over-
                   scrupulous brother. There are too many beams in my own eyes
                   for me to be concerned about the speck in my brother's eye.

                     Coming back to the subject of meats sacrificed to idols,
                   what is it that makes the eating of such foods wrong? Rom.
                   14:14.

                      The words must be interpreted so as to bring out what the
                   author meant to say. The subject is still foods sacrificed to idols.
                   Paul is saying that there is nothing wrong per se in eating such
                   foods. Elsewhere he points out that this conclusion is based
                   on the fact that idols do not have a real existence (1 Cor. 8:4, 5).
                   Not all grasp this fact, Paul told the Corinthians, "for some
                   with conscience of the idol until this hour eat it as a thing of-
                   fered unto an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled"
                   (verse 7).
                      It is always wrong to violate one's conscience, even an unen-
                   lightened conscience. This fact the "strong" brethren appar-
                   ently did not understand. They despised the scrupulosity of the
                   "weak" brethren and put stumbling blocks in their way.
                      If the words of Romans 14:14 were taken by themselves with-
                   out reference to what Paul meant them to say, they could lead to
                   completely unwarranted conclusions, such as that there is
                   nothing basically unclean. Think, for example, of the sexual
                   perversions pointed out in Romans 1:26-29. No one could pos-
                   sibly conclude that Paul could be meaning there is nothing
                   basically wrong with any of them, except as a person might have
                   doubts about them.

Living the Life of Faith-2       LESSON 13                       ❑ Wednesday
                                                                    March 26
           Part 4   In view of the "weak" brother's scrupulosity, how was the
       GIVING NO "strong" brother to modify his conduct?
        OFFENSE
                    "If thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou
                  not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ
                  died."
                    "It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any
                  thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is
                  made weak" (Rom. 14:15, 21).

                      It is interesting to note that the modification Paul suggests is
                   on the part of the "strong" brother.
                      In verses 17-20 Paul is trying to put various aspects of Chris-
                   tianity into proper perspective. While diet is an important as-
                   pect, Christians ought not to quarrel over the choice on the part
                   of some to eat vegetables instead of flesh meats possibly sac-
                   rificed to idols. Instead, they ought to focus on righteousness,
                   peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.

                    What limits does Paul place on individual independence?
                   Rom. 14:22, 23.

                      One can enjoy his independence "before God," having set-
                   tled it with Him as to what is allowed and what is forbidden. But
                   "before God" expresses the limit. Before our fellow Christians
                   we must act with reference to their scruples.
                      Have you heard someone say, "It is none of anyone's business
                   what I eat or what I wear or what kind of entertainment I engage
                   in"? It may be true that it's none of the scrupulous brother's
                   business. But it is Christ's business. He is concerned about the
                   scrupulous brother. If, through our independent conduct, the
                   weak brother "for whom Christ died" is led to violate his con-
                   science and as a result "perish," sin against Christ is registered
                   against us. "When ye sin so against the brethren, and wound
                   their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ. Wherefore, if meat
                   make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world
                   standeth, lest I make my brother to offend" (1 Cor. 8:12, 13).

THINK IT THROUGH     What is the real danger in individual independence?

                      "There have ever been in the church those who are constantly
                   inclined toward individual independence. They seem unable to
                   realize that independence of spirit is liable to lead the human
                   agent to have too much confidence in himself and to trust in his
                   own judgment rather than to respect the counsel and highly
                   esteem the judgment of his brethren."—The Acts of the Apos-
                   tles, p. 163.

           Pad 5   Over what other matter is the scrupulous brother con-
      OBSERVANCE cerned?
         OF DAYS
                   "One man esteemeth one day above another: another es-
                 teemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in
                 his own mind" (Rom. 14:5).

                     About what days is Paul speaking? Was there a controversy in
                   the early church over the observance or nonobservance of
                   certain days? We get a hint of such a controversy in Galatians
                   4:9, 10, where Paul berates the Galatian Christians for observ-
                   ing "days, and months, and times, and years." As we noted in
                   lesson 2, the Judaizers had persuaded the Galatian Christians
                   to be circumcised and keep other precepts of the law of Moses.
                   Paul feared that these Judaizers might harm the Roman church
                   as well. But perhaps in Rome it was particularly the Jewish
                   Christian who had a hard time persuading himself that he need
                   no longer observe the Jewish festivals.
                     Some Christians, to be on the safe side, decided to observe
                   one or more of the obsolete Jewish festivals. Paul's counsel is,
                   Let them do it, if they are persuaded they should.
                     To bring the weekly Sabbath into Romans 14:5, as some
                   antisabbatarians do, is unwarranted. Those who introduce the
                   Sabbath here are arguing from words rather than meaning.

                    What principle is it that allows for differences in practice
                   among sincere Christians? Rom. 14:6.

                     In either case, the Christian is acting with reference to what he
                   thinks the Lord wants him to do. Verse 6 explains further what is
                   said in verse 5 about being "fully persuaded." Whether they
                   observe the day or not, they do so on the basis of what they are
                   persuaded is the Lord's will in the matter.

                     What does Paul mean when he says, "None of us liveth to
                   himself"? Rom. 14:7, 8.

                     This verse has so long been interpreted to mean that every
                   person exerts an influence on others that for many people its
                   contextual meaning has been lost. While it is true that every
                   person exerts an influence, and that the words of this passage
                   can be interpreted in that way, what Paul is saying in context is
                   that no man acts with reference to himself, but with reference to
                   the Lord. "No man" is here "no true Christian." Such a Christian
                   does not consult his own mind or his own pleasure as to what to
                   do, but always the will of the Lord. Whatever he does, he under-
                   takes because he believes such a course to be the will of the
                   Lord for him. Paul thus sets forth an important principle by
                   which a Christian should guide his conduct.

           Part 6   How did Paul sum up his counsel concerning mature at-

     BENEDICTION
                    "We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the
                  weak, and not to please ourselves" (Rom. 15:1).

                     Read also verses 2 and 3. More is here commended than an
                   attitude of leaving the weak brother alone to believe and act as
                   he is persuaded he should. Positive action supporting him,
                   helping him bear his infirmities, pleasing him is enjoined. No
                   better, example for such positive Christian action can be cited
                   than Christ, who, instead of pleasing Himself, gave Himself for
                   others selflessly.

                      As Paul brought his letter to a close, what varied benedic-
                   tions did he utter? Rom. 15:5, 6, 13, 33.

                     The God of patience means the God who helps His children
                   steadfastly to endure. The word for "patience," hupomone,
                   means "fortitude," "steadfast endurance." The word for
                   "consolation" may be translated "encouragement." The God of
                   encouragement is the God who encourages. The God of hope is
                   the God who has given hope to mankind. Likewise, the God of
                   peace is the God who gives peace and in whom one may have
                   peace.
                      What a fitting benediction to a letter whose dominant theme is
                   righteousness by faith—encouragement, hope, peace! How
                   sorely our present world needs these.

                     After numerous personal greetings, how did Paul bring his
                   letter to a close? Rom. 16:25-27.

                      Paul ends his letter in a glorious ascription of praise to God.
                   God is the one in whom the Roman Christians and all Christians
                   can safely put their trust to confirm their standing as redeemed
                   sons and daughters of God, justified by faith, and now led by the
                   Spirit of God.
                      Paul is thrilled to be the herald of such glorious news. He calls
                   this news his gospel. What he means is the gospel he proclaims.
                   But what he preaches has been confirmed by the preaching of
                   Jesus and by the messages of the prophets. It was kept secret,
                   not because God did not want men to know, but because men
                   refused light from heaven, preventing God from giving them
                   further light. Moreover, there were some aspects of the plan that
                   men would be unable to grasp until the Messiah would come in
                   human flesh. He gave a demonstration, not only of what God is
                   like, but also of what man may become by laying hold of divine
                   power. The new kind of life would be one of "obedience of
                   faith," that is, obedience, or godlikeness, springing from faith,
                   the true motivating power.
