GENERAL CONFERENCE OF SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTISTS

     Sept4.-4,dea Depeatmt

 To Sabbath School Members Around the World
 Dear Fellow Believers:

 The Trans-Africa Division Family wishes to thank all Sabbath
 School members for the liberal support given in the 1978 Special
 Project Offering to our Division which was for the erection of
 an evangelistic center in the large city-of Kinshasa, Zaire. Now
 we have an experienced and capable worker located in this metrop-
 olis and further plans are in the development stage.

 For our project this quarter, we would like to share with you a
 dream we have had for several years: that of building 500 rural
 chapels throughout the Division! This is an ambitious project!
 Here is the way we believe it can be done: our unions and fields
 will select congregations which are most in need of chapels.
 Through a co-operative plan of shared expenses the local congre-
 gations will prepare and burn kilns of bricks and provide the
 labor'for construction. Your funds will be combined with our
 available resources to add corrugated iron roofs, cement floors,
 doors and windows for these chapels.

 You see in some areas, 90 percent of our congregations meet in mud
 and thatch buildings. Other congregations meet under trees or out
 in the open. We have found, as many of you have, that permanent
 church homes do wonders to help stabilize and strengthen our
 congregations.

 In your mind's eye, visualize these happy groups of people through-
 out the countries of our Division, rolling up their sleeves and
 launching their brick-making work, seeing the walls of the chapels
 go up, the metal roofs added, then the doors and window glasses
 fitted in. Then visualize the day of the first meeting in their
 new church homes1, Multiplied thousands of voices will be raised
 in praise to God and in appreciation to their brethren in all the
 world for helping them build clean, modest little chapels.

 We have shared our dream with you. On behalf of this Division we
 wish to say a hearty "THANK YOU" for helping your brothers and
 sisters in Africa realize its fulfillment.

 Very cordially yours,

          Lucy sells lemonade here four days a
          week, after school, for 5C a glass. Her
          mother donates the lemonade. Lucy
usually sells fifteen glasses of lemonade a day. So
her weekly income is $3.00.

     On Sabbath, Lucy puts a quarter and a nickel
into an envelope, marks it "Tithe" and drops it in the
offering plate. That 10% of Lucy's income helps
support the world ministry of the church. Lucy is
happy to return her tithe to the Lord.

                                       Introduction


   ,The Christians of the last days are called to live in a world that is more and more
complex and more and more corrupt. At the same time, despite increasing iniquity
and the growing coldness of most Christians, God requires that His people "shew
forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light"
(1 Peter 2:9).
   It is fitting then to define in some detail the spiritual life that Jesus taught charac-
terizes the citizens of His kingdom. We expect the coming of Jesus in our day, and we
must be fit for it. Ellen White notes that "Enoch's life and character, which were so
holy that he was translated to heaven without seeing death, represent what the lives
and characters of all must be, if, like Enoch, they are to be translated when Christ
shall come."—Our High Calling, p. 278.
    The characteristics of the citizens of the kingdom are clearly outlined in the first
part of the Sermon on the Mount, usually called the Beatitudes. Here Jesus superbly
portrays the spirit that, beginning here on earth, must imbue all those who hope, one
day, to live in the kingdom of heaven.
    "Here He [Jesus] specified who should be the subjects of His heavenly kingdom. He
did not speak one word to flatter the men of the highest authority, the worldly
dignitaries. But He presents before all the traits of character which must be pos-
sessed by the peculiar people who will compose the royal family in the kingdom of
heaven. He specifies those who shall become heirs of God and joint-heirs with
Himself. He proclaims publicly His choice of subjects, and assigns them their place in
His service as united with Himself. Those who possess the character specified, will
share with Him in the blessing and the glory and the honor that will ever come to
Him."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 1084.
    For this reason the Beatitudes will serve as the basis of our study this quarter. The
first lesson is introductory to the Beatitudes and is about the kingdom of heaven of
which we are called to be citizens. With the second lesson a study of the Beatitudes of
Jesus is begun and continues through lesson 12. These lessons (2 through 12)
correspond to the Bible passages that Ellen White has included in the chapter "The
Beatitudes" in the book Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing. Lesson 13 is drawn
from Jesus' illustration of the two gates given near the close of the Sermon on the
Mount. This lesson presents Jesus' appeal to enter "in at the strait gate" (Matt. 7:13),
which represents in part the principles taught in the Beatitudes.
    May the careful study of these lessons awaken the desire of each one to grow more
and more I ikeJesus, thus glorifying God and contributing to the hastening of Christ's
kingdom of glory.

       HOW TO READ
        THE SERMON      "Seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and
      ON THE MOUNT     when he was set, his disciples came unto him" (Matt. 5:1).

                         It's always helpful to consider the context of any scriptural
                       passage. However, there are special cases where it is almost a
                       must that we consider the audience and circumstances for
                       which a certain portion of the Bible was written. This is true in
                       the case of the Sermon on the Mount. At the very outset in her
                       book Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, Ellen White offers
                       the following suggestion: "Let us in imagination go back to that
                       scene, and, as we sit with the disciples on the mountainside,
                       enter into the thoughts and feelings that filled their hearts.
                       Understanding what the words of Jesus meant to those who
                       heard them, we may discern in them a new vividness and beauty,
                       and may also gather for ourselves their deeper lessons."—
                       Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 1.

                         Who was the intended audience for what has become
                       known as the Sermon on the Mount? Matt. 5:1.

                         Jesus' ministry had been in progress for some time when He
                       decided that the disciples should begin to bear heavier evan-
                       gelistic responsibilities. He had prayed all night for wisdom to
                       say precisely what they needed to hear in order to overcome
                       their inherited misconceptions of His work and role as the
                       Messiah. The disciples were the intended audience; but, as
                       always, Jesus was hdppy to share the truth with anyone who was
                       willing to listen.

                         What lesson did Jesus want to teach His disciples when He
                       gave the Beatitudes? Matt. 5:20.

                          It was not unusual for a Jewish teacher to expound upon the
                       law in order to refine its application to fit the needs of a specific
                       time and place. So if Jesus followed this Jewish method of
                       contrasting the old with the new in the latter part of Matthew 5,
                       that would not have aroused any suspicion. But content was a
                       different matter.
                          The disciples were Jews, and they shared their countrymen's
                       belief that the Messiah's sole purpose would be to reestablish
                       the kingdom of Judah. Their understanding of Jesus' mission
                       was clouded by these false expectations. They needed a correc-

                   verses 17, 18, 20.)

                      God had given His people two gifts: (a) a knowledge of Him-
                    self, and (b) a knowledge of the ideals He had in mind for
                    created beings. The chosen people had memorized the ideals
                    but had lost sight of the God who stood behind them. Hence the
                    law became a matter for prideful achievement. Religious indi-
                    viduals were inclined to draw attention to themselves rather
                    than to God. While God's friends are supposed to be living
                    evidence for the quality of heaven's values, they are above all
                    responsible for keeping a true knowledge of God alive in soci-
                    ety. As we read Hosea 4 and Romans 1, the greatest need of this
                    world is a knowledge of what kind of person God is.

                      In what way does God depend upon His earthly friends in
                    sustaining the values of the kingdom of heaven? Matt. 5:17-
                    19.

                       "The Saviour came to glorify the Father by the demonstration
                    of His love.... The honor of God, the honor of Christ, is involved
                    in the perfection of the character of His people."—The Desire of
                    Ages, p. 671.
                       When our spiritual ancestors forgot God, the law became an
                    end in itself. It became burdensome; joyful and willing obedi-
                    ence was replaced by legalistic and mechanical obedience.

                      What is the message of those who would uphold the king-
                    dom of heaven today? Matt. 5:20.

                       "It is the darkness of misapprehension of God that is en-
                    shrouding the world. Men are losing their knowledge of His
                    character. It has been misunderstood and misinterpreted. At
                    this time a message from God is to be proclaimed, a message
                    illuminating in its influence and saving in its power. His charac-
                    ter is to be made known."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 415.

THINK IT THROUGH      Do we concentrate on personal achievement, to the point of
                    crowding out a desire to share with our neighbors our knowl-
                    edge of the kind of person God Is?

                                                                       September 30
            Part 3   What is the relation between the church and the kingdom of
      THE KINGDOM God?
           OF GOD
          IS HERE    "The kingdom of God cometh not with observation: neither
                   shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of
                   God is within you" (Luke 17:20, 21).

                         The phrases "kingdom of heaven" and "kingdom of God" are
                      virtually interchangeable: they refer to the presence of God's
                      values and His offer of salvation. There were moments in Old
                      Testament history when God's values and His offer of salvation
                      shone brightly, and there were others when these were hardly
                      visible. However, it was the life of Jesus that gave a full illumina-
                      tion of what it means to be a member of the kingdom of God.
                      Since the time of Christ the Christian church has tried to keep
                      this illumination vivid, with some success and some failure.

                        How visible is the kingdom of heaven in the world today?
                      Luke 17:20.

                         "The kingdom of God comes not with outward show. It comes
                      through the gentleness of the inspiration of His word, through
                      the inward working of His Spirit, the fellowship of the soul with
                      Him who is its life. The greatest manifestation of its power is
                      seen in human nature brought to the perfection of the character
                      of Christ."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 36.
                         This passage in Luke indicates that members of God's king-
                      dom on earth are difficult to identify by mere external means.
                      They may be members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church;
                      they may be in other religious communities. Or like the centu-
                      rion who came to Jesus, they may show no outward allegiance
                      to any religion. Eventually all of God's friends will come to-
                      gether as a remnant, but in the meantime what does their being
                      scattered throughout all communions and peoples imply?

                        Why did many of Jesus' countrymen not realize the pres-
                      ence of the kingdom of heaven? Luke 17:21.

                        "That which led the Jews to reject the Saviour's work was the
                      highest evidence of His divine character. . . . The highest evi-
                      dence that He came from God is that His life revealed the
                      character of God. He did the works and spoke the words of God.
                      Such a life is the greatest of all miracles."—The Desire of Ages,
                      pp. 406, 407.

THINK IT THROUGH        When we hear the phrase "kingdom of heaven," do we tend
                      to think of a specific church or institution, or do we think of an
                      ongoing witness to the life of Christ?

The Kingdom of Heaven          LESSON 1                          ❑ Wednesday
                                                                    October 1
         Part 4   Why do you think the majority of God's chosen people reject
    DIMENSIONS Jesus' description of the kingdom of heaven?
        OF THE
    KINGDOM-1     "He came unto his own, and his own received him not"
                (John 1:11).

                      Jesus' offer of membership in the kingdom of God was re-
                   jected by most of His countrymen. They challenged His right to
                   offer membership in the kingdom of God, because His descrip-
                   tion of the kingdom differed so widely from theirs. Ellen White
                   says: "The Jews looked for the kingdom of God to be estab-
                   lished in the same way as the kingdoms of the world. To pro-
                   mote righteousness they resorted to external measures."—
                   Christ's Object Lessons, p. 77. They had completely inverted the
                   value system of God, which placed service as the most presti-
                   giOus of virtues.

                     What did God hope that the Israelites would achieve? Luke
                   13:18, 19.

                     "Their obedience to the law of God would make them marvels
                   of prosperity before the nations of the world. . . .
                     " . . . As in obedience to His natural laws the earth should
                   produce its treasures, so in obedience to His moral law the
                   hearts of the people were to reflect the attributes of His charac-
                   ter. Even the heathen would recognize the superiority of those
                   who served and worshiped the living God."—Christ's Object
                   Lessons, pp. 288, 289.

                     What does it mean to be a faithful member of God's king-
                   dom? Matt. 6:10.

                      "Faith is trusting God—believing that He loves us and knows
                   best what is for our good."—Education, p. 253.
                      Jesus did not reject the law and the inspired guidelines His
                   countrymen cherished. What He did reject was the picture of
                   God they had come to entertain. It is a law that people become
                   like the God they worship. Israel formed their understanding of
                   God after earthly kings. They had long since forgotten God's
                   reticence even to permit them a human king and had molded
                   their religious insights after the principles that moved worldly
                   governments.

THINK IT THROUGH     Read The Desire of Ages, p. 550, and consider to what extent
                   even ChriOians have adopted worldly values for rating suc-
                   cess.

The Kingdom of Heaven            LESSON 1                            ❑ Thursday
                                                                      October 2
            Part 5   What does God expect of His modern-day representatives?
       DIMENSIONS
           OF THE    "Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of
       KINGDOM-2 heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in
                   three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened" (Matt.
                   13:33).

                        The kingdom of heaven was not withdrawn from the earth
                     when Jesus ascended to the throne of His heavenly Father.
                     Through the working of His Spirit in the lives of His earthly
                     friends, the true principles of God's kingdom were to be kept
                     attractive and highly visible until He should come again.

                       In what way is religious truth like leaven? Matt. 13:33.

                        "As the leaven, when mingled with the meal, works from
                     within outward, so it is by the renewing of the heart that the
                     grace of God works to transform the life.... There are many who
                     try to reform by correcting this or that bad habit, and they hope
                     in this way to become Christians, but they are beginning in the
                     wrong place. Our first work is with the heart. . . .
                          ... True obedience is the outworking of a principle within.
                     . . . The essence of all righteousness is loyalty to our
                     Redeemer."—Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 97, 98.
                        Quite simply, our spiritual ancestors lost sight of their Re-
                     deemer. Their motives for obedience became pride and a desire
                     for status of various kinds.

                       As a church member, what is your role in sustaining the
                     kingdom of heaven? Ps. 67:1-3.

                       "Through His people Christ is to manifest His character and
                     the principles of His kingdom."—Christ's Object Lessons, p.
                     296.
                       "We are to praise God by tangible service, by doing all in our
                     power to advance the glory of His name. God imparts His gifts to
                     us that we also may give, and thus make known His character to
                     the world."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 300.

THINK IT THROUGH       In a stunning rebuke, Ellen White suggests: "The sin of the
                     world today is the sin that brought destruction upon Israel.
                     Ingratitude to God, the neglect of opportunities and blessings,
                     the selfish appropriation of God's gifts.... They are bringing
                     ruin upon the world today."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 302.

The Kingdom of Heaven          LESSON 1                               ❑ Friday
                                                                      October 3
          Part 6     How do you explain the change in atmosphere between the
  TWO SERMONS      giving of the law on Sinai and Jesus' Sermon on the Mount?
  ON THE MOUNT
                     "They said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will
                   hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die" (Ex. 20:19).

                     There is a striking contrast between the thunderous events
                   recorded in Exodus 20:18-21 and those—at least initially—
                   quiet, personal moments set down in Matthew 5. It's almost a
                   movement from earthquake and fire to the still small voice. Two
                   great information-giving occasions, but two distinct styles.

                     How did God communicate with Elijah on the mountain?
                   1 Kings 19:11, 12.

                     If Eden gives us an ideal picture of. God/man relationships,
                   then walking and talking with God as with a friend is the pre-
                   ferred means of communication. This is underlined by the fact
                   that all through Ellen White's writings the emphasis is on
                   thoughtful and reasonable apprehension of truth. But God
                   meets people where He finds them. He adapts His means of
                   communication to their specific situation.
                     "An important lesson for every minister of Christ to learn is
                   that of adapting his labors to the condition of those whom he
                   seeks to benefit. Tenderness, patience, decision, and firmness
                   are alike needful; but these are to be exercised with proper
                   discrimination. To deal wisely with different classes of minds,
                   under varied circumstances and conditions, is a work requiring
                   wisdom and judgment enlightened and sanctified by the Spirit
                   of God."—The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 385, 386.

                     How would you have accepted the contrast between Sinai
                   and the Mount of Blessing? (See Matt. 5:21-26.)

                      Had we been Jews at the time of Christ's first advent, would
                   we have accepted Christ, given the prevailing preconceived
                   notions that the Messiah should work in an atmosphere of
                   thunder and lightning? Would we have understood that the
                   reception of truth is progressive, that God refines His presenta-
                   tion of it as people themselves become more refined? Note this
                   from Ellen White:
                      "The Word of God presents special truths for every age....
                   God is leading out His people step by step. Truth is progres-
                   sive."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary,

                                          Looking upon the vast throng
                                          gathered to listen to the Sermon on
                                          the Mount, He seemed for the
                                          moment to have forgotten that He
                                          was not in heaven, and He used the
                                          familiar salutation of the world of
                                          light. From His lips flowed blessings
                                          as the gushing forth of a long-sealed
                                          fountain.
                                             "Turning from the ambitious,

                                          He declared that those were blessed

             OBJECT the Beatitudes?
             OF THE
         BEATITUDES   "Blessed are" (Matt. 5:3-11).

                        "In the opening words of the Sermon on the Mount, Christ
                     addresses Himself to the supreme desire of every human
                     heart—happiness. This desire was implanted in man by the
                     Creator Himself, and was originally ordained to lead him to find
                     true happiness through cooperation with the God who created
                     him. Sin is involved when men attempt to achieve happiness as
                     an end in itself, by a short cut that by-passes obedience to the
                     divine requirements.
                        "Thus at the commencement of His inaugural address as King
                     of the kingdom of divine grace Christ proclaims that the main
                     objective of the kingdom is to restore the lost happiness of Eden
                     to the hearts of men, and that those who choose to enter in by
                     the 'strait' gate and the 'narrow' way (Matt. 7:13, 14) will find true
                     happiness. They will find inward peace and joy, true and lasting
                     satisfaction for heart and soul that come only when 'the peace
                     of God, which passeth all understanding,' is present to keep
                     their 'hearts and minds through Christ Jesus' (Phil. 4:7)."—
                     S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 324.

                        According to Matthew, how many beatitudes did Jesus pro-
                      nounce? Matt. 5:3-12. Compare with Luke 6:20-26.

                        "The word makarios [happy, blessed] appears nine times in
                     vs. 3-11. But vs. 10, 11 refer to the same aspect of Christian
                     experience, and are therefore to be considered one beatitude,
                     thus leaving eight rather than nine beatitudes. Luke gives only
                     four beatitudes, the first, fourth, second, and eighth of Matthew,
                     in that order (Luke 6:20-23), but he adds four corresponding
                     woes (vs. 24-26)."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 324.

THINK IT THROUGH       Should we attribute a symbolic meaning to the Beatitudes
                     given in the book of Matthew?

                       If has been said that the Beatitudes are to the spiritual life
                     what the octave is to music.
                       We should not imagine that the Beatitudes place candidates
                     for the kingdom of God in eight distinct categories, not that
                     there are eight different roads leading to that end. The
                     Beatitudes, like the fruit of the Spirit, are all part of the whole;
                     they go together. All the graces will be possessed by the candi-
                     date for the kingdom of God.

The Poor in Spirit      LESSON 2                                          ❑ Monday
                                                                           October 6
           Part 2     Who are the poor mentioned in the first beatitude?
    BLESSED ARE
       THE POOR       "Blessed are you poor (Luke 6:20, RSV).
                      "Blessed are the poor in spirit" (Matt. 5:3).

                       By specifying that this is a matter of spiritual poverty, Jesus
                    submits that to have right to the kingdom of God, it is not
                    enough merely to be poor in earthly possessions. This poverty
                    of spirit—consciousness of spiritual deficiency—alludes to a
                    certain honesty and humility in assessing one's spiritual pos-
                    sessions. Without it the materially poor can themselves be at-
                    tached to riches, desiring passionately to possess them, even
                    though they do not actually enjoy them. Then the poor, like the
                    rich, enslaved to a desire for possessions, are not "poor in
                    spirit."
                       "Happy are they, He said, who recognize their spiritual pov-
                    erty, and feel their need of redemption. The gospel is to be
                    preached to the poor. Not to the spiritually proud, those who
                    claim to be rich and in need of nothing, is it revealed, but to
                    those who are humble and contrite. One fountain only has been
                    opened for sin, a fountain for the poor in spirit."—The Desire of
                    Ages, pp. 299, 300.

                      Why does God choose the poor rather than the rich to inherit
                    the kingdom? James 2:5.

                       In reality God is not partial to special groups. He does not
                    exclude anyone. If the Messianic promises are addressed espe-
                    cially to the disinherited, to the poor of the world, it is because
                    by circumstance they are more inclined to turn to God and to
                    look to Him for all things. It is their inner inclinations that render
                    the poor more open to the gospel, not poverty itself. On the
                    other hand, history bears witness that the poor of every age and
                    of every country are the first to respond to God's call. (See 1 Cor.
                    1:26-29.) Jesus pointed out this fact in the parable of the mar-
                    riage supper.

THINK IT THROUGH      What characteristic of the rich forms an obstacle to answer-
                    ing Christ's call?

                      The obstacle is not money itself; rather it is a selfish attach-
                    ment to money, the greedy quest for it, selfish possession of
                    worldly wealth, limitless confidence in riches, the poor man's
                    envy of the rich, the rich man's avarice. After declaring, "How
                    hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of
                    God!" Jesus clarified His statement by adding, "How hard is it
                    for them that trust riches to enter into the kingdom of God!"
                    (Mark 10:23, 24).

            Part 3     What terms used by the prophet Isaiah to foretell the work of
      GOOD NEWS      the Messiah did Jesus borrow to announce His mission?
     TO THE POOR
                       "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath
                     anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me
                     to heal the brokenhearted" (Luke 4:18, 19).

                       "Christ came to preach the gospel to the poor. He reached the
                     people where they were. He brought plain, simple truth to their
                     comprehension."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible
                     Commentary. vol. 5, pp. 1119, 1120.
                       "Christ came to this earth to walk and work among the poor
                     and suffering. They received the greatest share of His attention.
                     And today, in the person of His children, He visits the poor and
                     needy, relieving woe and alleviating suffering."—Testimonies,
                     vol. 7, p. 226.
                       The poor occupied an important place in our Lord's teach-
                     ings, and the early church knew how to put these teachings into
                     practice.

                      What proof of His Messiahship did Jesus send to John the
                     Baptist? Matt. 11:2-5.

                        Miracles and the preaching of the good news to the poor were
                     the signs that Jesus gave to John's envoys, who had been sent
                     to ascertain if Jesus was indeed the Messiah announced by the
                     prophets and expected by Israel.
                        The poor spoken of in the Bible were not necessarily desti-
                     tute. The word was especially used to designate the peasantry,
                     who were ravaged as much by the ruling Jews as by the occupy-
                     ing power, particularly after the exile.
                        The poor in Israel are mentioned in certain of the psalms. (See
                     Pss. 40:17; 69:33; 109:31.) The prophets were their defenders; it
                     was to them that they announced the Messianic kingdom. They
                     are the ones of whom it was said that they awaited "the consola-
                     tion of Israel" and "redemption in Jerusalem" (Luke 2:25, 38).
                     Although they were mistaken about the nature of His kingdom,
                     God announced the Messiah's advent to them first: the
                     shepherds, Simeon, Anna. Joseph and Mary were of their
                     number—of them who were able to offer only the sacrifices of
                     the poor in the temple. (See Luke 2:21-24.) It was also to the
                     poor in Israel that Jesus first preached the good news of salva-
                     tion.

THINK IT THROUGH       Following the example set by the early church, are we ready
                     to provide for the material and spiritual needs of those less
                     fortunate than we? (See Acts 2:44, 45; 11:28-30.)

The Poor in Spirit     LESSON 2                                 ❑ Wednesday
                                                                   October 8
           Part 4   What lesson did Jesus wish to teach in the parable of the
           THOSE marriage supper?
      INVITED TO
       THE FEAST    "Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and
                  bring in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the
                  blind" (Luke 14:21).
                      "The Jews commonly supposed that persons suffering either
                   financially or physically were in ill favor with God, and thus
                   these classes were often despised and neglected by their fellow
                   men. . . . God, presumably, had cast them off, and society
                   therefore considered them outcasts also. In this parable Jesus
                   denies that such persons are despised by God, and declares
                   that they should not be despised by their fellow men, even when
                   their sufferings may be due to their own misdeeds or unwise
                   course of action. The poverty stricken and physically defective
                   here seem to represent primarily those who are morally and
                   spiritually bankrupt. They have no good works of their own to
                   offer God in exchange for the blessings of salvation."—S.D.A.
                   Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 809.

                    What example did Jesus give us that illustrates perfectly
                   who are the "poor in spirit"? Luke 18:9-14.
                     "In the days of Christ the religious leaders of the people felt
                   that they were rich in spiritual treasure. The prayer of the
                   Pharisee, 'God, I thank Thee, that I am not as the rest of men'
                   (Luke 18:11, R.V.), expressed the feeling of his class and, to a
                   great degree, of the whole nation. But in the throng that sur-
                   rounded Jesus there were some who had a sense of their
                   spiritual poverty.... In these souls, Christ's words of greeting
                   awakened hope; they saw that their lives were under the bene-
                   diction of God."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, pp.
                   6, 7.

THINK IT THROUGH     Am I able to judge myself, to know the feelings of my own
                   heart?

                     " 'The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately
                   wicked; who can know it?' Jer. 17:9. The lips may express a
                   poverty of soul that the heart does not acknowledge. While
                   speaking to God of poverty of spirit, the heart may be swelling
                   with the conceit of its own superior humility and exalted righ-
                   teousness. In one way only can a true knowledge of self be
                   obtained. We must behold Christ. It is ignorance of Him that
                   makes men so uplifted in their own righteousness. When we
                   contemplate His purity and excellence, we shall see our own

The Poor in Spirit         LESSON 2                                     ❑ Thursday
                                                                         October 9
              Part 5   How did Christ's life exemplify His teachings on the subject
             JESUS, of poverty?
       OUR EXAMPLE
                       "Ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he
                     was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through
                     his poverty might be rich" (2 Cor. 8:9).

                        "After Christ had condescended to leave His high command,
                      step down from an infinite height and assume humanity, He
                      could have taken upon Him any condition of humanity He might
                      choose. But greatness and rank were nothing to Him, and He
                      selected the lowest and most humble walk of life. The place of
                      His birth was Bethlehem, and on one side His parentage was
                      poor, but God, the owner of the world, was His Father.
                        "No trace of luxury, ease, selfish gratification, or indulgence
                      was brought into His life, which was a continual round of self-
                      denial and self-sacrifice. In accordance with His humble birth,
                      He had apparently no greatness or riches, in order that the
                      humblest believer need not say Christ never knew the stress of
                      pinching poverty. Had He possessed the semblance of outward
                      show, of riches, of grandeur, the poorest class of humanity
                      would have shunned His society; therefore He chose the lowly
                      condition of the far greater number of the people."—Ellen G.
                      White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 7, pp. 903, 904.

                        Where do we find the perfect example of humility? Phil.
                      2:5-8.

                         "For Paul, all spiritual life centers in Christ, and when he
                      wishes to inculcate lessons of unity and humility, he can find no
                      better method than to present, in outline form, the story of his
                      Master's career, as the supreme exemplification of the virtues
                      he desires the Philippians to possess. . . . Christ left a state of
                      inexpressible glory, took upon Himself the most humble form of
                      humanity, and performed the most lowly of offices, that men
                      might be saved. Christians are to frame their lives according to
                      this great example."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 154.

THINK IT THROUGH        What should we do to remain humble?

                         "In order to preserve humility, it would be well to remember
                      how we appear in the sight of a holy God, who reads every secret
                      of the soul, and how we should appear in the sight of our fellow
                      men if they all knew us as well as God knows us. For this reason,
                      to humble us, we are directed to confess our faults, and improve
                      this opportunity to subdue our pride."—Testimonies, vol. 3, p.

 OF THE KINGDOM
                      "Their's is the kingdom of heaven" (Matt. 5:3). (See also
                    James 2:5.)

                      "This kingdom is not, as Christ's hearers had hoped, a tem-
                    poral and earthly dominion. Christ was opening to men the
                    spiritual kingdom of His love, His grace, His righteousness. The
                    ensign of the Messiah's reign is distinguished by the likeness of
                    the Son of man. His subjects are the poor in spirit, the meek, the
                    persecuted for righteousness' sake. The kingdom of heaven is
                    theirs. Though not yet fully accomplished, the work is begun in
                    them which will make them 'meet to be partakers of the inheri-

                    Rev. 3:17, 18.

                       "It is difficult for those who feel secure in their attainments,
                    and who believe themselves to be rich in spiritual knowledge, to
                    receive the message which declares that they are deceived and
                    in need of every spiritual grace. The unsanctified heart is 'de-
                    ceitful above all things, and desperately wicked.' I was shown
                    that many are flattering themselves that they are good ChriS-
                    tians, who have not a ray of light from Jesus. They have not a
                    living experience for themselves in the divine life. They need a
                    deep and thorough work of self-abasement before God before
                    they will feel their true need of earnest, persevering effort to
                    secure the precious graces of the Spirit."—Testimonies, vol. 3,
                    p. 253.

THINK IT THROUGH      Lord, anoint my eyes that I may see!

                       "Jesus had presented the cup of blessing to those who felt
                    that they were 'rich, and increased with goods' (Revelation
                    3:17), and had need of nothing, and they had turned with scorn
                    from the gracious gift. He who feels whole, who thinks that he is
                    reasonably good, and is contented with his condition, does not
                    seek to become a partaker of the grace and righteousness of
                    Christ. . . . Those who know that they cannot possibly save
                    themselves, or of themselves do any righteous action, are the
                    ones who appreciate the help that Christ can bestow. They are
                    the poor in spirit, whom He declares to be blessed."—Thoughts

                                                                          October 12
             Part 1     What significance should be given to the mourning and
        PROMISE OF    tears mentioned in the second beatitude?
       CONSOLATION
           AND JOY      "Blessed are those who mourn" (Matt. 5:4, RSV).
                        "Blessed are you that weep now" (Luke 6:21, RSV).

                         The close relationship between the first and second beati-
                      tudes should be considered. No one will deny the literal mean-
                      ing of the second beatitude. Our Lord demonstrated it, and,
                      moreover, He devoted the best of His ministry to the afflicted,
                      the sick, the unfortunate.
                         But this beatitude, like the first, finds full meaning when it is
                      applied to the spiritual life. "The mourning here brought to view
                      is true heart sorrow for sin."—Thoughts From the Mount of
                      Blessing, p. 9.
                         "The profound spiritual poverty of the 'poor in spirit' . . . is
                      matched by the deep mourning of the persons described in v. 4.
                      In fact, it is a deep sense of spiritual need that leads men to
                      `mourn' for the imperfection they see in their own lives. . . .
                      Christ here refers to those who, in poverty of spirit, long to reach
                      the standard of perfection (cf. Isa. 6:5; Rom. 7:24). There is a
                      message of comfort here also for those who mourn because of
                      disappointment, bereavement, or other sorrow."—S.D.A. Bible
                      Commentary, vol. 5, p. 325.

                        How is our Lord's promise to the afflicted realized both
                      today and in the future? Matt. 5:4; Luke 6:21.

                          As the poor and the underprivileged of this world place their
                      confidence in God's promises, there is and there will be conso-
                      lation for them. The hope of a better world comforts them now:
                      it is already a consolation for them, a source of joy. The parable
                      of the rich man and Lazarus teaches us that he who places his
                      confidence in God and patiently endures suffering in this world
                      will know the joy and happiness of God's children in the ages to
                      come. (See Luke 16:19-31.) But there is more!
                          "As God meets the sense of spiritual need with the riches of
                      the grace of heaven ... , so He meets the mourning over sin with
                      the comfort of sins forgiven. Except there be first a sense of
                      need, there will not be mourning for what one lacks—in this
                      case, righteousness of character. Mourning for sin is thus the
                      second requirement made of those who present themselves as
                      candidates for the kingdom of heaven, and follows naturally in
                      sequence after the first step."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol.
                      5, p. 325.

THINK IT THROUGH        What other Bible texts teach the same truth as that of the
                      second beatitude? (See Jer. 31:13; Ps. 126:5, 6.)

            Part 2   What does the Bible teach concerning the afflictions of
    PARTAKERS OF men?
     HIS HOLINESS
                     "Hear, 0 earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people,
                   even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not hear-
                   kened unto my words, nor to my law, but rejected it" (Jer. 6:19).

                      "No truth does the Bible more clearly teach than that what we
                    do is the result of what we are. To a great degree the experi-
                    ences of life are the fruition of our own thoughts and deeds.
                      " 'The curse causeless shall not come.' Proverbs 26:2. . . .
                      "Terrible is this truth, and deeply should it be impressed.
                    Every deed reacts upon the doer. Never a human being but may
                    recognize, in the evils that curse his life, fruitage of his own
                    sowing. Yet even thus we are not without hope."—Education, p.
                    146.

                      What is God's purpose in permitting afflictions? And what is
                    their immediate effect on us? Heb. 12:10, 11.

                       God does not cause our misfortunes, but He does use them to
                    lead us back to Him, to teach, to correct, to educate, to sanctify
                    us. "Through affliction God reveals to us the plague spots in our
                    characters, that by His grace we may overcome our faults.
                    Unknown chapters in regard to ourselves are opened to us, and
                    the test comes, whether we will accept the reproof and the
                    counsel of God. When brought into trial, we are not to fret and
                    complain. We should not rebel, or worry ourselves out of the
                    hand of Christ. We are to humble the soul before God. The ways
                    of the Lord are obscure to him who desires to see things in a
                    light pleasing to himself. They appear dark and joyless to our
                    human nature. But God's ways are ways of mercy and the end is
                    salvation."—The Desire of Ages, p. 301.

THINK IT THROUGH       How do you understand trials?

                      "The trials of life are God's workmen, to remove the im-
                    purities and roughness from our character. Their hewing,
                    squaring, and chiseling, their burnishing and polishing, is a
                    painful process; it is hard to be pressed down to the grinding
                    wheel. But the stone is brought forth prepared to fill its place in
                    the heavenly temple. Upon no useless material does the Master
                    bestow such careful, thorough work. Only His precious stones
                    are polished after the similitude of a palace."—Thoughts From

                                                                       October 14
          Part 3     What is the difference between godly sorrow and the sorrow
      TWO KINDS    of the world?
     OF SORROW
                     "Godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be
                   repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death" (2 Cor.
                   7:10).

                      "In 'godly sorrow' there is recognition and admission that one
                   has wronged God and his fellow men, adequate effort to right
                   the wrong, and a reorientation of the life with the purpose of
                   avoiding a repetition of the same mistakes. . .
                      " ... Worldly sorrow consists of regret for the consequences
                   of the sin rather than for the sin itself, and at being discredited
                   before the world and worldly friends (1 Sam. 15:30). Worldly
                   sorrow plays only upon the surface of the problem. It mounts no
                   higher than the man himself, and his own feelings. It leads to
                   future regret and to deeper distress. It fills the mind with discon-
                   tent, the heart with resentment and chagrin. It embitters and
                   shortens life. A person who truly repents will never regret hav-
                   ing done so."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 884.

                     What biblical examples best illustrate the two kinds of sor-
                   row? Matt. 27:3-5; Luke 22:60-62.

                      "Perhaps the supreme illustration of the difference between
                   true and false sorrow for sin lies in the contrast between Peter
                   and Judas during the trial of Jesus. Both felt bitter remorse, but
                   with the one there was true sorrow for sin, which led to a new life
                   in Christ; with the other there was only sorrow for the conse-
                   quences, which led to utter despair and then suicide."—S.D.A.
                   Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 884.
                      The original Greek makes a clear distinction between the
                   repentance of Peter, which was produced by godly sorrow, and
                   that of Judas. In the first example, the word metanoia, which is
                   used, denotes a change of mind, of goals, of direction—that is,
                   conversion. In the case of Judas, the word metamelomai, which
                   is employed, means regret, mere remorse.

THINK IT THROUGH     Have you experienced godly sorrow?

                      "Real sorrow for sin is the result of the working of the Holy
                   Spirit. The Spirit reveals the ingratitude of the heart that has
                   slighted and grieved the Saviour, and brings us in contrition to
                   the foot of the cross. By every sin Jesus is wounded afresh; and
                   as we look upon Him whom we have pierced, we mourn for the
                   sins that have brought anguish upon Him. Such mourning will
                   lead to the renunciation of sin."—The Desire of Ages, p. 300.

The Mourners       LESSON 3                                      ❑ Wednesday
                                                                   October 15
         Part 4      What was the reason for Christ's sorrow?
       CHRIST'S
       SORROW        "When he drew near and saw the city he wept over it" (Luke
                   19:41, RSV).
                     "Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane ... he
                   began to be sorrowful and troubled. Then he said to them, 'My
                   soul is very sorrowful, even to death' " (Matt. 26:36-38, RSV).
                   (Compare Heb. 5:7, 8.)

                     Not all affliction and sadness are necessarily the direct con-
                   sequence of sin. The sufferings of Job, like those of Jesus, prove
                   this. Christ's sadness was indeed caused by sin, but not His
                   own. Jesus suffered because of the sins of others and of the
                   world. He was profoundly saddened by the callousness of the
                   Pharisees (Mark 3:5); He cried over Jerusalem, because of the
                   indifference of her children to the salvation God was offering
                   them, which they finally rejected.
                     "It was the sight of Jerusalem that pierced the heart of
                   Jesus—Jerusalem that had rejected the Son of God and
                   scorned His love, that refused to be convinced by His mighty
                   miracles, and was about to take His life. He saw what she was in
                   her guilt of rejecting her Redeemer, and what she might have
                   been had she accepted Him who alone could heal her wound.
                   He had come to save her; how could He give her up?"—The
                   Desire of Ages, p. 576.
                     The sadness experienced by Jesus in the Garden of Gethsem-
                   ane was caused by His dread of the death that brings about
                   complete separation from God. "Upon Him who knew no sin
                   must be laid the iniquity of us all. So dreadful does sin appear to
                   Him, so great is the weight of guilt which He must bear, that He is
                   tempted to fear it will shut Him out forever from His Father's
                   love. Feeling how terrible is the wrath of God against.transgres-
                   sion, He exclaims, 'My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto
                   death.' "—The Desire of Ages, p. 685.

                     What consoled Jesus in His sufferings? Heb. 12:2; Isa.
                   53:10, 11.

                      "He [Jesus] knew that He would live to see the results 'of the
                   travail of his soul,' and was 'satisfied' (Isa. 53:11). To share
                   eternity with the ransomed of all ages and the unfallen beings of
                   other worlds was a prospect that brought utter joy to our
                   Lord."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 482.

THINK IT THROUGH     "Looking to Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of our faith....
                   Consider him who endured from sinners such hostility against
                   himself, so that you may not grow weary or fainthearted"

The Mourners       LESSON 3                                          ❑ Thursday
                                                                      October 16
          Part 5   What special grace is promised to the believer in regard to
       GRACE TO suffering?
     SUFFER FOR
         CHRIST    "Unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to
                 believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake; having the same
                 conflict which ye saw in me" (Phil. 1:29, 30).

                       "Of all the gifts that heaven can bestow upon men, fellowship
                   with Christ in His sufferings is the most weighty trust and the
                   highest honor. Not Enoch, who was translated to heaven, not
                   Elijah, who ascended in a chariot of.fire, was greater or more
                   honored than John the Baptist, who perished alone in the
                   dungeon."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 478.
                       "Faithful Christians, from apostolic times onward, have been
                   glad to suffer for the Master's sake (Acts 5:41; 1 Peter 3:14;
                   4:12-14). Those who face the trials of the last days must possess
                   that same true sense of values. Severe as were the tests of Peter
                   and his associates, they were little compared with those of the
                   last great times of trouble. Only one thoroughly persuaded that
                   it is the highest of honors and the greatest of blessings to be
                   permitted to suffer for Christ's sake will persevere through
                   times when the unrestrained fury of Satan is unleashed."—
                   S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 150.

                     How should a Christian consider participation in Christ's
                   sufferings? 1 Peter 4:12-16; Col. 1:24.

                      Following Christ's example, the Christian should patiently,
                   victoriously endure the trials of the present life, when their goal
                   is the advancement of God's work on earth. It is therefore an
                   honor and a source of joy to share the sufferings of Christ for His
                   body, which is His church. Like Jesus, who did it "for the joy that
                   was set before him" (Heb. 12:2), His disciple will do it in antici-
                   pation of the joy and gladness that are reserved for the day when
                   Jesus shall appear in His glory. (See 1 Peter 4:13.)

THINK IT THROUGH    A thought to ponder daily: What does sharing in the work of
                   Christ mean to you?

                      "Blessed are they also who weep with Jesus in sympathy with
                   the world sorrow and in sorrow for its sin. In such mourning
                   there is intermingled no thought of self.... All who are followers
                   of Christ will share in this experience. As they partake of His love
                   they will enter into His travail for the saving of the lost. They
                   share in the sufferings of Christ, and they will share also in the
                   glory that shall be revealed. One with Him in His work, drinking
                   with Him the cup of sorrow, they are partakers also of His
                   joy."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, pp. 12, 13.

                                                                      October 17
        Part 6   What assurance should be ours in all our trials? And, in turn,
   CONSOLATION what ministry has been entrusted to us?
     AND HOPE
                 "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
               the Father of mercies and God of all comfort, who comforts us
               in all our affliction, so that we may be able to comfort those
               who are in any affliction, with the comfort with which we our-
               selves are comforted by God. For as we share abundantly in
               Christ's sufferings, so through Christ we share abundantly in
               comfort too" (2 Cor. 1:3-5, RSV).

                      These words renew the assurance given by Jesus in the sec-
                   ond beatitude—consolation for the Christian in each of his
                   trials. Through Jesus, God provided "the consolation of Israel"
                   (Luke 2:25). By His Spirit He still makes provision for "all our
                   affliction" (2 Cor. 1:4, RSV).
                      Moreover, he who knows this comfort through experience
                   with his God is, in turn, able to sympathize with a suffering
                   brother and, in God's name, to minister consolation to him.

                     What relationship did Paul establish between affliction and
                   hope? Rom. 5:3-5.

                     "Patient endurance of tribulation tests, confirms, and refines
                   the Christian's faith. Out of this comes ever more confident
                   hope. It is the believer's initial hope of sharing in the glory of
                   God (see v. 2) that nerves him to endure in the first place. And as
                   he continues to endure, he gains a steady, calm assurance.
                   Hope and faith grow as they are tested and exercised. . . . The
                   experience of Job illustrates how the severe discipline of
                   character can strengthen the faith and hope of a sincere
                   believer."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 525.

                     What marvelous comfort is offered to those who await the
                   restoration of all things? Rev. 7:17; 21:4. •

                      "This earth is the place of preparation for heaven. The time
                   spent here is the Christian's winter. Here the chilly winds of
                   affliction blow upon us, and the waves of trouble roll against us.
                   But in the near future, when Christ comes, sorrow and sighing
                   will be forever ended. Then will be the Christian's summer. All
                   trials will be over, and there will be no more sickness or death.
                   'God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be
                   no more death,• neither sorrow, nor crying .. . : for the former
                   things are passed away.' "—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A.

                                           more precious than fine gold, even a
                                           man than the golden wedge of

                                                                         October 19
              Part 1 In the third beatitude what spiritual virtue is held in high
         NEED OF A esteem?
         DEFINITION
                     "Blessed are the meek" (Matt. 5:5).

                        The Hebrew word anaw and its Greek equivalent praus are not
                     always translated in the same way. Modern languages give the
                     word meek an implied meaning of "mousy," "tame," ''timid,"
                     "docile"; so today meekness often suggests weakness or a lack
                     of strength of character. To understand this beatitude we
                     should note the meaning of the word meek.
                        "A distillation of inspired definition would seem to charac-
                     terize meekness as an absence of self-seeking and a presence
                     of self-forgetfulness. It is 'government of self' (Testimonies, vol.
                     4, p. 348), 'a calm and trustful spirit,' lowliness of heart' (The
                     Desire of Ages, p. 301), 'the ornament of God's own choice' (The
                     Sanctified Life, p. 16). Meekness, then, is an inward calm and
                     peace of mind that shows itself in outward gracious, courteous,
                     kind, and friendly behavior. It has been termed 'an attitude of
                     mind and heart that prepares the way for sanctification.' "—
                     J. M. Lien, Review and Herald, August 16, 1973.

                      How should we interpret the promise made to the meek?
                     Matt. 5:5.

                        Through the psalmist God promised the earth to the meek
                     (Ps. 37:11). Daniel said it is "the kingdom under the whole
                     heaven" that "shall be given to the people of the saints of the
                     most High" (Dan. 7:27). But the earth promised by Jesus is
                     above all the earth restored, "a new earth, wherein dwelleth
                     righteousness" (2 Peter 3:13).
                        Another interpretation, however, should not be excluded. Is
                     not self-control the first victory gained by the meek? As gentle-
                     ness of character naturally conquers hearts, it works itself into
                     another's favor more effectively than does force or talent. That
                     is why gentleness must characterize the peaceful conquerors
                     whom Jesus sends into the world to prepare it for His kingdom.

THINK IT THROUGH      According to this definition of gentleness, what is the first
                     weakness every Christian must overcome?

                        "Human nature is ever struggling for expression, ready for
                     contest; but he who learns of Christ is emptied of self, of pride,
                     of love of supremacy, and there is silence in the soul. Self is
                     yielded to the disposal of the Holy Spirit."—Thoughts From the
                     Mount of Blessing, p. 15.

The Meek     LESSON 4                                                 ❑ Monday
                                                                      October 20
         Part 2    From whom can we learn meekness best?
        JESUS,
      MODEL OF     "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I
      MEEKNESS will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for
                I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your
                souls" (Matt. 11:28, 29).

                     Jesus not only teaches truth; He is truth. Whatever He
                   teaches, He lived; what He asks His hearers to become, He
                   Himself is. That is why He can invite men to come to Him, the
                   One who is "meek and lowly in heart." The source of His gentle-
                   ness and His humility is in Himself, in His heart, a heart filled
                   with devotion and compassion for mankind (Matt. 9:36).
                     "We are to enter the school of Christ, to learn from Him
                   meekness and lowliness. Redemption is that process by which
                   the soul is trained for heaven. This training means a knowledge
                   of Christ."—The Desire of Ages, p. 330.

                     What event in the life of Christ, announced by the prophet
                   Zechariah, especially illustrates His gentleness and His
                   humility? Matt. 21:4, 5.

                     "Through all the lowly experiences of life He consented to
                   pass, walking among the children of men, not as a king, to
                   demand homage, but as one whose mission it was to serve
                   others. There was in His manner no taint of bigotry, no cold
                   austerity. The world's Redeemer had a greater than angelic
                   nature, yet united with His divine majesty were meekness and
                   humility that attracted all to Himself."—Thoughts From the
                   Mount of Blessing, p. 14.
                     "In this one triumphant scene [triumphal ride into Jerusalem]
                   of His earthly life, the Saviour might have appeared,escorted by
                   heavenly angels, and heralded by the trump of God; but such a
                   demonstration would have been contrary to the purpose of His
                   mission, contrary to the law which had governed His life. He
                   remained true to the humble lot He had accepted. The burden of
                   humanity He must bear until His life was given for the life of the
                   world."—The Desire of Ages, p. 571.

THINK IT THROUGH     What was the principal object of Jesus' teaching? What
                   should be our chief concern?

                     "He [Jesus] said nothing to gratify curiosity or to stimulate
                   selfish ambition. He did not deal in abstract theories, but in that
                   which is essential to the development of character; that which
                   will enlarge man's capacity for knowing God, and increase his
                   power to do good. He spoke of those truths that relate to the
                   conduct of life and that unite man with eternity."—Education, p.

         VIOLENCE 12:3.
     TO MEEKNESS
                    "Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and
                   was mighty in words and in deeds" (Acts 7:22).

                     Moses was not naturally a meek man. (See Ex. 2:11-14.) Con-
                   vinced that he was to be the liberator of the Israelites, he sought
                   to obtain their liberation by force of arms.
                     "In the military schools of Egypt, Moses was taught the law of
                   force, and so strong a hold did this teaching have upon his
                   character that it required forty years of quiet and communion
                   with God and nature to fit him for the leadership of Israel by the
                   law of love."—Education, p. 65.
                     "There were other lessons that, amid the solitude of the
                   mountains, Moses was to receive. In the school of self-denial
                   and hardship he was to learn patience, to temper his passions."
                   —Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 247.

                     What testimony did the apostle Paul bear concerning the
                   transformation of his character? 1 Tim. 1:12, 13; Acts 8:3;
                   26:9-11; 2 Tim. 3:10.

                       Note, first, some of the expressions that Paul used to describe
                   his character before conversion: "blasphemer," "persecutor,"
                    "injurious," "extremely zealous." "I persecuted the church of
                   God violently and tried to destroy it" (Gal. 1:13, RSV). In the book
                   of Acts, Luke points out the same brutality: "Saul was ravaging
                   the church, and entering house after house, he dragged off men
                   and women and committed them to prison" (8:3, RSV). In his
                   discourse before King Agrippa, Paul declared: "I myself was
                   convinced that I ought to do many things in opposing the name
                   of Jesus of Nazareth . . . ; I . . . shut up many of the saints in
                   prison, ... and I punished them often in all the synagogues and
                   tried to make them blaspheme; and in raging fury against them,
                   I persecuted them" (Acts 26:9-11, RSV).
                      Several years later this same Paul, who had become an im-
                   itator of Christ, wrote: "When reviled, we bless; when perse-
                   cuted, we endure; when slandered, we try to conciliate" (1 Cor.
                   4:12, 13, RSV). Then, as he faced death, Paul again said of
                   himself, and charged his closest co-worker to bear him witness:
                   "You have observed my teaching, my conduct, my aim in life, my
                   faith, my patience, my love" (2 Tim. 3:10, RSV).

THINK IT THROUGH     Although the transformation of life is not so spectacular as
                   that of Moses or Paul, the goal before you is the same. "I urge
                   you, then, be imitators of me" (1 Cor. 4:16, RSV).

The Meek     LESSON 4                                            El   Wednesday
                                                                      October 22
          Part 4     What did the apostle Peter write of meekness?
       A PRICE-
    LESS VIRTUE      "Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plait-
                   ing the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;
                   but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not
                   corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit,
                   which is in the sight of God of great price" (1 Peter 3:3, 4).

                      "Meekness is the inward adorning, which God estimates as of
                   great price. The apostle speaks of this as more excellent and
                   valuable than gold or pearls or costly array. While the outward
                   adorning beautifies only the mortal body, the ornament of
                   meekness adorns the soul and connects finite man with the
                   infinite God. This is the ornament of God's own choice. He who
                   garnished the heavens with the orbs of light has by the same
                   Spirit promised that 'he will beautify the meek with salvation'
                   (Ps. 149:4). Angels of heaven will register as best adorned those
                   who put on the Lord Jesus Christ and walk with Him in meek-
                   ness and lowliness of mind."—The Sanctified Life, p. 16.

                     What recommendation does Paul make to every man of God
                   concerning the fruit of the Spirit, of which meekness is a part?
                   Gal. 5:22, 23; 1 Tim. 6:11.

                      "Meekness in the school of Christ is one of the marked fruits
                   of the Spirit. It is a grace wrought by the Holy Spirit as a
                   sanctifier, and enables its possessor at all times to control a
                   rash and impetuous temper. When the grace of meekness is
                   cherished by those who are naturally sour or hasty in disposi-
                   tion, they will put forth the most earnest efforts to subdue their
                   unhappy temper. Every day they will gain self-control, until that
                   which is unlovely and unlike Jesus is conguered."—The Sancti-
                   fied Life, p. 15.

THINK IT THROUGH     To what length should we go to acquire this virtue, which is
                   of such great value in God's eyes?

                      "The most precious fruit of sanctification is the grace of
                   meekness. When this grace presides in the soul, the disposition
                   is molded by its influence. There is a continual waiting upon
                   God and a submission of the will to His. The understanding
                   grasps every divine truth, and the will bows to every divine
                   precept, without doubting or murmuring. True meekness sof-
                   tens and subdues the heart and gives the mind a fitness for the
                   engrafted word. It brings the thoughts into obedience to Jesus
                   Christ."—The Sanctified Life, pp. 14, 15.

                (Phil. 4:5, RSV).
                      Throughout all ages the true strength of Christianity has been
                   in the love that men manifest one toward another. Not only love
                   for those who love us, or for our neighbor, but also for our
                   enemies. (See Matt. 5:43-46.) "How they love one another!" was
                   the testimony that people bore concerning the first Christians. It
                   is also what the world should be able to say of the church
                   entrusted with the proclamation of God's last message for a
                   doomed world.
                      "Those who claim to believe in Christ are to represent Christ
                   in deeds of kindness and mercy. Such will never know until the
                   day of judgment what good they have done in seeking to follow
                   the example of the Saviour."—Welfare Ministry. p. 86.
                      "If we would humble ourselves before God, and be kind and
                   courteous and tenderhearted and pitiful, there would be one

                   mandments. There is work for everyone, and if all will obey, we

                   before God, and seek meekness and righteousness, that you
                   may be hid in the day of the Lord's fierce anger."—Testimonies,

THINK IT THROUGH      What do you consider to be the strongest evidence of Chris-
                   tian nobility?

                      "The highest evidence of nobility in a Christian is self-control.
                   He who under abuse or cruelty fails to maintain a calm and
                   trustful spirit robs God of His right to reveal in him His own
                   perfection of character. Lowliness of heart is the strength that
                   gives victory to the followers of Christ; it is the token of their

              Part 1   What is the meaning of the word "righteousness" as used in
     HUNGERING AND the fourth beatitude?
      THIRSTING FOR
     RIGHTEOUSNESS     "Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righ-
                     teousness" (Matt. 5:6).

                         "In every instance of its use in the NT (94 times) dikaiosune is
                      translated 'righteousness.' Among the Greeks 'righteousness'
                       consisted in conformity to accepted customs. To the Jews it was
                      essentially a matter of conformity to the requirements of the law
                      as interpreted by Jewish tradition. (See Gal. 2:16-21.) But for
                      Christ's followers, righteousness took on a broader meaning.
                      Instead of going about to establish their own righteousness,
                      Christians were called to submit 'themselves unto the righ-
                      teousness of God' (Rom. 10:3). They sought for the righteous-
                      ness 'which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness
                      which is of God by faith' (Phil. 3:9)."—S.D.A. Bible Commen-
                      tary, vol. 5, p. 326.

                        What assurance does Jesus give to all who hunger and
                      thirst for righteousness? Matt. 5:6.

                        This metaphor was especially meaningful to Christ's hearers,
                      most of whom had experienced hunger and thirst at one time or
                      another. Moreover, no word could have been more pleasing to
                      their ears than the promise of righteousness at a time when
                     Israel was awaiting the advent of the Messiah with the hope that
                     He would deliver them from their yoke of bondage, establish
                     righteousness, and administer law over all people.
                        "Only those who long for righteousness with the eager anxi-
                     ety of a man starving for lack of food or famishing for want of
                     water, will find it. No earthly source can satisfy the hunger and
                     thirst of the soul, whether it be material riches, profound
                     philosophies, the satisfaction of physical appetites, or honor
                     and power. After experimenting with all of these things, Sol-
                     omon concluded that 'all is vanity.' "—S.D.A. Bible Commen-
                     tary, vol. 5, p. 326.

THINK IT THROUGH        Under what condition can we appropriate the Master's prom-
                      ise to those who hunger and thirst for righteousness?

                        "The sense of unworthiness will lead the heart to hunger and
                      thirst for righteousness, and this desire will not be disap-
                      pointed. Those who make room in their hearts for Jesus will
                      realize His love. All who long to bear the likeness of the charac-

        THE RIGH-    other things?
       TEOUSNESS
          OF GOD       "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness;
                     and all these things shall be added unto you" (Matt. 6:33).

                        The righteousness of God should be the constant concern of
                     the Christian. There are pagans who seek only the com-
                     monplace needs of daily life; that is, they are blind to the true
                     reality of life, ignorant of God and of His redemptive act. He who
                     hungers and thirsts after righteousness will never be satisfied
                     until he finds true righteousness, the righteousness of God in
                     the person of Jesus Christ.
                        "The righteousness of God is embodied in Christ. We receive
                     righteousness by receiving Him.
                        "Not by painful struggles or wearisome toil, not by gift or
                     sacrifice, is righteousness obtained; but it is freely given to
                     every soul who hungers and thirsts to receive it.... 'This is His
                     name whereby He shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGH-
                     TEOUSNESS.' Jeremiah 23:6."—Thoughts From the Mount of
                     Blessing, p. 18.

                      According to the prophet Daniel, what type of righteousness
                     would the . Messiah bring to earth? Dan. 9:24.

                        "Men will learn of the reconciliation for iniquity and of the
                     everlasting righteousness which the Messiah has brought in
                     through His sacrifice. The cross of Calvary is the great center.
                     This truth acted upon will make Christ's sacrifice effectual. This
                     is that which Gabriel revealed to Daniel in answer to fervent
                     prayer. It was of this that Moses and Elijah and Christ talked at
                     His transfiguration. By the humiliation of the crass He was to
                     bring everlasting deliverance to all who would walk after Him,
                     giving positive evidence that they are separated from the

                     is the glory of God, which closes the work of the third angel."—

         CHRIST OUR
     RIGHTEOUSNESS        "Now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart
                       from law, although the law and the prophets bear witness to it,
                       the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all
                       who believe. For there is no distinction; since all have sinned
                       and fall short of the glory of God, they are justified by his grace
                       as a gift, through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus"
                       (Rom. 3:21-24, RSV).

                          "When in love and gratitude the believer in Jesus commits
                       himself without reservation to the mercy and will of God, the
                       righteousness of justification is imputed to him. And as he
                       continues daily in this experience of trust, surrender, and fel-
                       lowship, his faith increases, enabling him to receive more and
                       more of the imparted righteousness of sanctification."—S.D.A.

                         "The religion of Christ means more than the forgiveness of
                       sin; it means taking away our sins, and filling the vacuum with
                       the graces of the Holy Spirit.... When Christ reigns in the soul,
                       there is purity, freedom from sin. The glory, the fullness, the
                       completeness of the gospel plan is fulfilled in the life."—

                       might be enabled fully to comply with the righteous require-
                       ments of His holy law. To bring man's life into harmony with the
                       divine will is the purpose of the plan of salvation. God did not
                       give His Son in order to change or abolish His law, or to release
                       men from the necessity of perfect obedience. The law has al-
                       ways stood as an expression of the unchangeable will and
                       character of God. Fallen man has been unable to obey its re-
                       quirements, and the law has possessed no power to strengthen
                       him to obey. But now Christ has come to make it possible for
                       man to render perfect obedience."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary,

Those That Hunger and Thirst            LESSON 5                  ❑ Wednesday
                                                                    October 29
           Part 4    In the parable of the lost sheep, who is the seeker? What
       JUSTIFIED does this teach about salvation? Luke 15:3-7.
       BY GRACE
                    The parable of the lost sheep teaches clearly that God calls
                  after man while he is still lost and that all Heaven rejoices when a
                  single sinner repents. Jesus affirmed this truth when He said,
                  "The Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was
                  lost" (Luke 19:10).
                    The lost man, like the lost sheep, can never find his way to
                  God of himself, neither by his intelligence or through force of
                  will. That is why, while we are still His enemies, God reconciles
                  us to Himself "by the death of his Son" (Rom. 5:10). "In this was
                  manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his
                  only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through
                  him. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us,
                  and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins" (1 John 4:9,
                  10).

                      What is the central truth of the parable of the Pharisee and
                    the publican? of the great debtor? Luke 18:9-14; Matt. 18:23-
                    35.

                      The parable of the Pharisee and the publican aptly illustrates
                    the fact that justification is possible only through faith and not
                    by works. Full of self-righteousness, the Pharisee was not
                    among those who hunger and thirst for the righteousness of
                    God. His numerous works, so he thought, were sufficient for
                    him. The publican, on the contrary, counted only on God's
                    mercy when he prayed, "God be merciful to me a sinner" (Luke
                    18:13). In conclusion Jesus affirmed: "This man went down to
                    his house justified rather than the other" (verse 14).
                      The parable of the great debtor teaches that salvation is free.
                    Like that servant, the sinner is incapable of repaying his debt to
                    God. Having called upon God's patience, like the king in the
                    parable, our Lord is "moved with compassion" and has forgiven
                    his debt (Matt. 18:27).

THINK IT THROUGH      We are not saved by good works but for good works.

                      "By grace you have been saved through faith; and this is not
                    your own, doing, it is the gift of God—not because of works, lest
                    any man should boast. For we are his workmanship, created in
                    Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand,
                    that we should walk in them" (Eph. 2:8-10, RSV).

Those That Hunger and Thirst             LESSON 5                     ❑ Thursday
                                                                       October 30
            Part 5    How does the parable of the prodigal son illustrate both the
     JUSTIFICATION fourth beatitude and the doctrine of imputed righteousness?
        TAUGHT IN  Luke 15:11-32.
         PARABLES
                      Jesus never employed the expressions "justification by faith"
                   or "imputed" and "imparted righteousness." Instead of
                   theological expressions, which are always abstract and some-
                   times obscure, Jesus used concrete, living lessons that every-
                   one could understand. In this way the parable of the prodigal
                   son wonderfully illustrates the doctrine of imputed righteous-
                   ness. The prodigal son experienced physical and spiritual
                   hunger as a consequence of his foolish behavior, and this led
                   him to repentance. He also experienced the joy of having his
                   father satisfy his needs with blessings and kindness. How well
                   this account depicts the sinner's dependence upon God for
                   both his title to heaven and his fitness for it.
                      By the "best robe" is symbolized God's imputing of Christ's
                   righteousness to man in response to his faith in God's pardon of
                   his sins.

                       In what way does the parable of the marriage feast teach
                     the doctrine of imparted righteousness? Matt. 22:1-14.

                       "The parable of the wedding garment opens before us a
                    lesson of the highest consequence. By the marriage is repre-
                    sented the union of humanity with divinity; the wedding gar-
                    ment represents the character which all must possess who shall
                    be accounted fit guests for the wedding."—Christ's Object Les-
                    sons, p. 307.
                       "By His perfect obedience He [Christ] has made it possible for
                    every human being to obey God's commandments. When we
                    submit ourselves to Christ, the heart is united with His heart, the
                    will is merged in His will, the mind becomes one with His mind,
                    the thoughts are brought into captivity to Him; we live His life.
                    This is what it means to be clothed with the garment of His
                    righteousness. Then as the Lord looks upon us He sees, not the
                    fig-leaf garment, not the nakedness and deformity of sin, but His
                    own robe of righteousness, which is perfect obedience to the
                    law of Jehovah."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 312.

THINK IT THROUGH       Both imputed and imparted righteousness are acts of God's
                     grace.

                        "We have nothing in ourselves of which to boast. We have no
                     ground for self-exaltation. Our only ground of hope is in the
                     righteousness of Christ imputed to us, and in that wrought by
                     His Spirit working in and through us."—Steps to Christ, p. 63.

                                                                         October 31
          Part 6   What solemn warning did Jesus give His disciples to put
 RIGHTEOUSNESS them on guard against a false interpretation of the righteous-
AND THE KINGDOM ness of God?
     OF HEAVEN
                   "I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the
                 scribes and Pharisees, you will never, enter the kingdom of
                 heaven" (Matt. 5:20, RSV).

                      Jesus did not abolish His law, nor did He release His disciples
                   from the obligation to observe it. Instead, He enlarged upon its
                   requirements. Christians, generally speaking, believe that
                   Christianity is an easing ofJudaism. They are pleased to seta
                   religion of love and pardon up over a religion of stern justice;
                   they even go so far as to speak of the Jewish law as being in
                   opposition to Christian grace, as if salvation by grace releases a
                   person from obedience to God's law.
                      Far from making void the law, faith establishes it (Rom. 3:31),
                   and grace makes its observance possible (Rom. 8:4), not simply
                   according to the letter of the law, but in its spirit. This is possible
                   because God writes His law in the heart (1-leb. 8:10). He requires
                   more than formal observance of its requirements. The scribes
                   and Pharisees viewed the demands of the law as resting upon
                   acts and deeds, but Jesus' requirements plumb the very secret
                   intents of the heart. Our Lord requires more, not less, from
                   those who are candidates for His kingdom.

                     What characterizes the kingdom of heaven, according to
                   the promises found in the Word of God? 2 Peter 3:13.

                     Righteousness will not be fully realized until the return of our
                   Lord Jesus Christ. Then will be manifest "the righteous judg-
                   ment of God; who will render to every man according to his
                   deeds" (Rom. 2:5, 6).
                     In that day those who hunger for the righteousness of God will
                   be fully satisfied. They will be ushered into "a new earth,
                   wherein dwelleth righteousness" (2 Peter 3:13). "And there
                   shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither
                   whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they
                   which are written in the Lamb's book of life" (Rev. 21:27).

THINK IT THROUGH    ,For what reason did God give us the Scriptures with their
                   commands and promises?

                     "All scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching,
                   for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness,
                   that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good
                   work" (2 Tim. 3:16, 17, RSV).

  "Blessed are the merciful: for they     impossible to be merciful without
shall obtain mercy" (Matt. 5:7).          sharing with another what God
                                          Himself has in mercy given him. He
    The preceding beatitude (Matt.        who has been filled must in turn
5:6) referred to the moral character      nourish those who hunger and thirst
of an individual. It affirmed that a      in this world in which we live. "Freely

filled.                                   disciples.
    The fifth beatitude, the subject of      Jesus Himself is our great Example,
this week's lesson study, confronts       the supreme manifestation of divine
the Christian with his obligation         mercy. "See what love the Father has
toward his neighbor, because it is        given us, that we should be called
                                          children of God; and so we are"
                                          (1 John 3:1, RSV). "In this is love, not
                                          that we loved God but that he loved
                                          us and set his Son to be the expiation
                                          for our sins" (1 John 4:10, RSV).
                                             This love embraces all humanity.
                                          "In making all mankind prisoners to
                                          disobedience, God's purpose was to
                                          show mercy to all mankind" (Rom.
                                          11:32, NEB). God's mercy knows no
                                          limit except the callousness of the
                                          sinner's heart. The promise is
                                          certain; every man who, following
                                          our Lord's example, shows himself
                                          merciful will obtain mercy.

                                                                         November 2
           Part 1   In the fifth beatitude who are described as being recipients
     THE MERCIFUL of God's blessing?

                      "Blessed are the merciful" (Matt. 5:7).

                      Current language identifies mercy with compassion or par-
                    don. To give this word all the richness of meaning given it in the
                    Bible, one must add the ideas of active kindness, graciousness,
                    tender pity, and, above all, fidelity. Actually, for the Bible writers,
                    mercy is the coming together of two currents of thought—
                    compassion and faithfulness: God's compassion toward
                    men—His people—and fidelity to Himself and to His alliance.
                      The merciful, then, are those who follow the example of their
                    heavenly Father and show compassion toward their neighbor,
                    whoever he might be, and who are faithful in their obligations
                    toward God.

                      How must we understand the promise that Jesus made to
                    the merciful? Matt. 5:7; 7:12.

                       God promises that whoever is merciful will obtain mercy
                    himself. Jesus also illustrated this principle in several of His
                    parables.
                       This promise is sure in that which concerns God's attitude
                    toward us. The child of Gad can experience it every day of his
                    life. But in small measure this principle is also verified in men's
                    relationships with one another.
                       "The principle of the golden rule (ch. 7:12) applies both to our
                    treatment of others and to the kind of treatment they accord us
                    in return. The cruel, hardhearted, mean-spirited man rarely re-
                    ceives kind and merciful treatment at the hand of his fellow
                    man. But how often those who are kind and considerate of the
                    needs and feelings of others find that the world often repays
                    them in kind."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 327.

THINK IT THROUGH      What does it mean to be merciful in our everyday life?

                      "God imparts His blessing to us that we may impart to others.
                    When we ask him for our daily bread, He looks into our hearts to
                    see if we will share the same with those more needy than our-
                    selves. When we pray, 'God be merciful to me a sinner,' He
                    watches to see if we will manifest compassion toward those
                    with whom we associate. This is tree evidence of our connection
                    with God, that we are merciful even as our Father in heaven is
                    merciful."—Testimonies, vol. 6, pp. 283, 284.

The Merciful       LESSON 6                                            ❑ Monday
                                                                      November 3
          Part 2      In what terms does God reveal the very essence of His
         GOD IS     character to us?
       MERCIFUL
                      "The Lord passed before him, and proclaimed, 'The Lord,
                    the Lord, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and
                    abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, keeping stead-
                    fast love for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression
                    and sin" (Ex. 34:6, 7, RSV).

                       MoseS had already received a revelation of divine transcen-
                    dency, when God appeared to him in the burning bush. At that
                    time God revealed His name: "I AM THAT I AM" (Ex. 3:14). At the
                    time of this second manifestation God revealed to Moses—and
                    through him to all His children—the very essence of His charac-
                    ter, infinitely "merciful and gracious." All the words used in this
                    disclosure tend to underline the infinite goodness of God
                    toward sinful man. The circumstances under which this revela-
                    tion was made further emphasize His merciful character. It was
                    as if it were God's response to the infidelity of the children of
                    Israel, who had just made a golden calf to worship, and to the
                    righteous anger of Moses (Ex. 32, 33).
                       In reality God had already revealed this trait of character when
                    He wrote His law on the tables of stone that Moses had just
                    broken. There He stated (in the third commandment), "I the
                    Lord thy God am a jealous God, . . . shewing mercy unto
                    thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments"
                    (Ex. 20:5, 6).
                       Note these Bible texts which show that the authors took
                    pleasure in emphasizing the merciful character of God: Neh.
                    9:17, 31; Ps. 86:15; Joel 2:13; James 5:11.
                       Actually the whole Bible repeats again and again the thought,
                    "Father of mercies," as the apostle Paul called Him. (See 2 Cor.
                    1:3.) The authors of the psalms were particularly happy to sing
                    of the unfathomable mercy of God, unto which they never
                    ceased to appeal. They discerned it everywhere, operating
                    throughout all the history of the children of Israel. Even in His
                    acts they discovered that "the Lord is merciful and gracious"
                    (Ps. 103:7, 8).
                       Not only is God "rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he
                    loved us" (Eph. 2:4), as the apostle Paul wrote, but the prophet
                    Micah states, He even "delighteth in mercy" (Micah 7:18).
                    (Compare Matt. 12:7.)

THINK IT THROUGH      To what degree does your personal experience allow you to
                    declare with the psalmist: "All the paths of the Lord are stead-
                    fast love and faithfulness, for those who keep his covenant
                    and his testimonies" (Ps. 25:10, RSV)?

           Part 3   What is the preeminent manifestation of God's infinite
          JESUS, mercy?
       MERCIFUL
     HIGH PRIEST    "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten
                  Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but
                  have everlasting life" (John 3:16).
                      "None but the Son of God could accomplish our redemption;
                    for only He who was in the bosom of the Father could declare
                    Him. Only He who knew the height and depth of the love of God
                    could make it manifest. Nothing less than the infinite sacrifice
                    made by Christ in behalf of fallen man could express the Fa-
                    ther's love to lost humanity."—Steps to Christ, p. 14.
                      How did Jesus give'evidence of God's mercy in His life and
                    teaching? Luke 4:18, 19; 19:10; Matt. 5:44.

                      "This was His work. He went about doing good and healing all
                    that were oppressed by Satan. There were whole villages where
                    there was not a moan of sickness in any house, for He had
                    passed through them and healed all their sick. His work gave
                    evidence of His divine anointing. Love, mercy, and compassion
                    were revealed in every act of His life."—Steps to Christ, pp. 11,
                    12.

                      What was conferred on Jesus in preparation for His high
                    priesthood in the heavenly sanctuary? Why? Heb. 2:17, 18;
                    4:14-16.
                       "Jesus consented to take human nature, that He might know
                    how to pity, and how to plead with His Father in behalf of sinful,
                    erring mortals. He volunteered to become man's Advocate, and
                    He humiliated Himself to become acquainted with the tempta-
                    tions wherewith man was beset, that He might succor those who
                    should be tempted, and be a tender and faithful high priest."—

THINK IT THROUGH     Many Christians believe that Christ's sacrifice made God
                    more favorable toward man. What do you think?

                       "This great sacrifice was not made in order to create in the
                    Father's heart a love for man, not to make Him willing to save.
                    No, no! 'God so loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten
                    Son.' John 3:16. The Father loves us, not because of the great
                    propitiation, but He provided the propitiation because He loves
                    us. Christ was the medium through which He could pour out His
                    infinite love upon a fallen world. 'God was in Christ, reconciling
                    the world unto Himself.' 2 Corinthians 5:19."—Steps to Christ,

The Merciful       LESSON 6                                       ❑ Wednesday
                                                                   November 5
          Part 4    In what way does Jesus invite us to imitate our heavenly
     IN THE LIKE- Father?
    NESS OF OUR
       HEAVENLY     "Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful"
         FATHER (Luke 6:36).

                       In its parallel passage in Matthew's Gospel, this verse reads:
                    "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven
                    is perfect" (Matt. 5:48). In other words, the perfection to which
                    Jesus calls His disciples is expressed in the mercy that they
                    show, after the example set by God, not only to those who love
                    them, but also to their enemies, those who hate and persecute
                    them. (See Matt. 5:43-47; Luke 6:27-35.)
                       The character of God which has been revealed to us is our
                    standard for life. We are invited to become more and more like
                    Him. "Be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one
                    another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you. Be ye
                    therefore followers of God, as dear children" (Eph. 4:32 through
                    5:1).
                       "God is Himself the source of all mercy. His name is 'merciful
                    and gracious.' Exodus 34:6. . .
                       "The merciful are 'partakers of the divine nature,' and in them
                    the compassionate love of God finds expression. All whose
                    hearts are in sympathy with the heart of Infinite Love will seek to
                    reclaim and not to condemn."—Thoughts From the Mount of.
                    Blessing, p. 22.

                      Exactly what is the lesson taught in the parable of the Good
                    Samaritan? Luke 10:25-37.

                       This parable is a perfect illustration of God's mercy in dealing
                    with man, as well as a vital demonstration of how the Christian
                    should act toward his neighbor. In truth, the feelings of com-
                    passion shown to the Samaritan exactly express the holy emo-
                    tion that made the Son of God come to earth to save humanity.
                    They are also the sentiments that should impel every Christian
                    toward his neighbor, whoever he be, every time an occasion of
                    need arises.

THINK IT THROUGH      Toward whom must we be merciful? Is there ever any trace
                    of discrimination when we consider this question?

                       "To the appeal of the erring, the tempted, the wretched vic-
                    tims of want and sin, the Christian does not ask, Are they
                    worthy? but, How can I benefit them? In the most wretched, the
                    most debased, he sees souls'whom Christ died to save and for
                    whom God has given to His children the ministry of reconcilia-
                    tion."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 22.

             Part 5      How did Jesus explain the principle of reciprocity expressed
       FORGIVEN AS     in the fifth beatitude?
        WE FORGIVE
                         "Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors." For if ye
                       forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also
                       forgive you: but if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither
                       will your Father forgive your trespasses" (Matt. 6:12, 14, 15).
                       (Compare 7:1, 2.)

                          "Jesus teaches that we can receive forgiveness from God
                       only as we forgive others. . . .
                          " ... He who is unforgiving cuts off the very channel through
                       which alone he can receive mercy from God. We should not
                       think that unless those who have injured us confess the wrong
                       we are justified in withholding from them our forgiveness. It is
                       their part, no doubt, to humble their hearts by repentance and
                       confession ... ; but as we hope to be pardoned for our offenses
                       against God we are to pardon all who have done evil to us."—
                       Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, pp. 113, 114.

                         Show how the parable of the great debtor is a commentary
                       on the principle stated by Jesus. Matt. 18:23-35.

                         "The pardon granted by this king represents a divine forgive-
                       ness of all sin. Christ is represented by the king, who, moved
                       with compassion, forgave the debt of his servant."—Christ's
                       Object Lessons, p. 244.
                         "But the great lesson of the parable lies in the contrast
                       between God's compassion and man's hardheartedness; in the
                       fact that God's forgiving mercy is to be the measure of our own.
                       'Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellow-
                       servant, even as I had pity on thee?'
                         "We are not forgiven because we forgive, but as we forgive.
                       The ground of all forgiveness is found in the unmerited love of
                       God, but by our attitude toward others we show whether we
                       have made that love our own. Wherefore Christ says, 'With what
                       judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged.' Matt. 7:2."—Christ's
                       Object Lessons, p. 251.

THINK IT THROUGH          "Forgiveness has a broader meaning than many suppose.
                      ... God's forgiveness is not merely a judicial act by which He
                      sets us free from condemnation. It is not only forgiveness for
                      sin, but reclaiming from sin. It is the outflow of redeeming love
                      that transforms the heart. David had the true conception of
                      forgiveness when he prayed, 'Create in me a clean heart, 0
                      God; and renew a right spirit within me.' Psalm 51:10."—

                                                                      November 7
          Part 6       What should be the rule of conduct for all who expect to
     IN THE DAY     triumph in the day of judgment?
   OF JUDGMENT
                      "Speak, act, as those who are to be judged by the law of
                    freedom; for the judgment will be merciless to the man who
                    has shown no mercy—whereas the merciful life will triumph in
                    the face of judgment" (James 2:12, 13, Moffatt).

                       The apostle James calls to mind the great and awesome
                    scene of the heavenly judgment. The law of God, which he calls
                    "the law of freedom," will be the standard by which the charac-
                    ter and life of men will be judged:
                       God will not make exception for persons, and "the judgment
                    will be merciless to the man who has shown no mercy" (verse
                    13). "A good man sheweth favour" (Ps. 112:5), and "the merciful
                    life will triumph" (James 2:13, Moffatt). Thus the promises
                    which Jesus made in the fifth beatitude will be fully realized.

                      What basic principle will guide the Son of man when the
                    nations are gathered before Him? Matt. 25:31-46.

                       The mercy of which Jesus speaks is an active principle ex-
                    pressed in acts of love toward one's neighbors. If this is not so,
                    mercy is of little value. In this judgment scene acts of mercy are
                    presented to us as being the test for admission to the kingdom.
                    For this same reason James includes acts of mercy in his defini-
                    tion of "pure and undefiled" religion (James 1:27, RSV).
                       "When the nations are gathered before Him, there will be but
                    two classes, and their eternal destiny will be determined by what
                    they have done or have neglected to do for Him in the person of
                    the poor and the suffering. . . .
                       " ... To those whom He sets upon His right hand He will say,
                    'Come, ye blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared
                    for you from the foundation of the world.' "—The Desire of
                    Ages, p. 637.

THINK IT THROUGH      Is my religion only doctrine? To what extent is it translated
                    into acts of mercy?

                      "The merciful 'shall obtain mercy.' . .. There is sweet peace
                    for the compgssionate spirit, a blessed satisfaction in the life of
                    self-forgetful service for the good of others. . . .
                      " . . . The Lord will not fail him in the hour of suffering and
                    need. . . . And in the hour of final need the merciful shall find
                    refuge in the mercy of the compassionate Saviour and shall be

  "Blessed are the pure in heart: for       In addressing the "pure in heart,"
they shall see God" (Matt. 5:8).         Jesus was obviously not referring to

abundance of the heart the mouth         sinners" to repentance (Matt. 9:13,

                                         God. Here Jesus addresses these
                                         people and promises them a vision of
                                         God because of the purity of their

The Pure in Heart          LESSON 7                                      ❑ Sunday
                                                                        November 9
              Part 1   What is the meaning of the word "heart" as it is used in the
          THE HEART Bible?
        A KEY WORD
                       "Keep your heart with all vigilance; for from it flow the
                     springs of life" (Prov. 4:23, RSV).

                          The word heart is used hundreds of times in the Bible, but
                       only rarely—not to say "never"—does the word refer to the
                       physical organ itself. Furthermore, in a figurative sense, the
                       Bible authors give the word a much broader meaning than
                       modern languages attribute to it. For us today the heart is
                       usually linked with the emotions; in the Bible it designates the
                       inward man, the intimate, hidden area of the being, as well as
                       the center of emotions and the intellect.
                         It should be noted that Bible writers considered the heart to
                       be the seat of the intellect and, more specifically, the center of
                      the will. From the heart good and evil thoughts issue, and in the
                      heart resolutions take shape that determine human destiny.
                         "When Jesus speaks of the new heart, He means the mind, the
                      life, the whole being."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible
                      Commentary. vol. 4, p. 1164.
                         To what did Jesus refer when He spoke of purity of heart?
                         "Purity of heart, in the sense Christ used it, includes far more
                      than sexual purity (MB 25); it includes all desirable character
                      traits to the exclusion of all that are undesirable. To be 'pure in
                      heart' is equivalent to being clothed with the robe of Christ's
                      righteousness . . , the 'fine linen' with which the saints are
                      arrayed (Rev. 19:8; cf. ch. 3:18, 19)—perfection of character.
                         "It was not ceremonial purity that Jesus had in mind (Matt.
                      15:18-20; 23:25), but inward cleanness of heart. If the motives
                      are pure, the life will be pure.
                         "Those with pure hearts have forsaken sin as a ruling princi-
                      ple in the life, and their lives are without reserve consecrated to
                      God. . . . To be 'pure in heart' does not mean that one is
                      absolutely sinless, but it does mean that his motives are right,
                      that by the grace of Christ he has turned his back on past
                      mistakes, and that he is pressing toward the mark of perfection
                      in Christ Jesus (Phil. 3:13-15)."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol.
                      5, p. 327.

THINK IT THROUGH        Since "the wisdom that is from above is first pure" (James
                      3:17), it alone can help us understand more fully what the
                      Saviour wished to say when He spoke of "the pure in heart."

The Pure in Heart      LESSON 7                                      ❑ Monday
                                                                    November 10
         Part 2   What role of prime importance did Jesus ascribe to the
    MAN'S HEART heart?
        IS EVIL

                     "What comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and
                   this defiles a man. For out of the heart come evil thoughts,
                   murder, adultery, fornication, theft, false witness, slander.
                   These are what defile a man" (Matt. 15:18-20, RSV). (Compare
                   Mark 7:21-23.)


                      The source of evil is found within the heart of man, not
                   without. Nothing is helped when only the outside is cleansed, as
                   the Pharisees were accustomed to doing. "First cleanse the
                   inside of the cup and of the plate," Jesus advised them, "that the
                   outside also may be clean" (Matt. 23:26, RSV). Without real
                   transformation of the heart, man cannot bear good fruit. At best
                   he may appear righteous to men on the outside, but within he
                   remains "full of hypocrisy and iniquity" (Matt. 23:28).
                      What explanation is given in the Bible of the heart's disposi-
                   tion to evil?
                      The fall of man in Eden took place at the heart level, at the seat
                   of the intellect and of the will. Adam and Eve exercised their own
                   wills instead of following God's bidding. Disobedience to the
                   will of God changed the heart, the very source of man's being,
                   the wellspring of all issues. That is why, since Eden, every
                   activity of man bears the stain of his heart, that is, of his mind
                   and will.
                      Since Eden the heart of man has been evil. It was because
                   "the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every
                   imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continu-
                   ally" (Gen. 6:5, RSV) that God could not intervene in favor of the
                   antediluvians. And God has warned that "as it was in the days of
                   Noah, so will it be in the days of the Son of man" (Luke 17:26,
                   RSV).

THINK IT THROUGH     How is what the Bible terms "hardness of heart" brought
                   about?

                      "This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye hence-
                   forth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,
                   having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the
                   life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the
                   blindness of their heart: who being past feeling have given
                   themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness
                   with greediness" (Eph. 4:17-19).

           Part 3     If "the inward mind and heart of a man are deep," as David
      GOD ALONE     affirms (Ps. 64:6, RSV), who can know it?
         KNOWS
      THE HEART       "Act, and render to each whose heart thou knowest, accord-
                    ing to all his ways (for thou, thou only, knowest the hearts of all
                    the children of men)" (1 Kings 8:39, RSV).
                      "Before him no creature is hidden, but all are open and laid
                    bare to the eyes of him with whom we have to do" (Heb. 4:13,
                    RSV).

                       The heart of man is difficult to understand. Confusion of
                    thought makes objective judgment of oneself impossible.
                    Others can judge only on appearance, which often does not
                    correspond to the true inner condition because of the natural
                    duplicity of the heart.
                      If we think that we can deceive God by hiding anything from
                    Him, we are only deceiving ourselves. He is able to read our
                    most intimate secrets, and. He also knows the source from
                    which issue all our thoughts, words, and actions. Not only does
                    God see the things that we are able to hide from men, but He
                    also perceives things that we do not know are there. Even when
                    "you . . . justify yourselves before men," Jesus stated, "God
                    knows your hearts" (Luke 16:15, RSV). This is why only God is in
                    a position to judge. "The Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man
                    looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the
                    heart" (1 Sam. 16:7).

                     Through what means does God reach the heart of man?
                    Heb. 4:12.
                       One will never completely understand to what extent God
                    depends on His Word, "the sword of the Spirit," "sharper than
                    any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and spirit
                    . . . , and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart"
                    (Eph. 6:17; Heb. 4:12, RSV), to dissipate the darkness of the
                    heart and make the light shine in. We know that by the Word of
                    God the Spirit takes possession of hearts and leads them into all
                    truth.
                       In the measure that man is willing to listen to the Word of God,
                    the Holy Spirit will open the ears (Isa. 50:5) and "the eyes of your
                    hearts" (Eph. 1:18, RSV), "until the day dawn, and the day star
                    arise in your hearts" (2 Peter 1:19).
                       "God's holy, educating Spirit is in His word. A light, a new and
                    precious light, shines forth from every page. Truth is there
                    revealed, and words and sentences are made bright and ap-
                    propriate for the occasion, as the voice of God speaking to the
                    soul."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 132.

The Pure in Heart        LESSON 7                                 ❑ Wednesday
                                                                   November 12
           Part 4   In order for God to be able to purify the heart, what four
   0 GOD, CREATE conditions must be met, as outlined by David in Psalm 51?
           IN ME
   A CLEAN HEART
                    "This passage in David's history is full of significance to the
                  repenting sinner. It is one of the most forcible illustrations given
                  us of the struggles and temptations of humanity, and of genuine
                  repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ."—
                  Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 726.

                      1.One must have the courage to recognize his sinful state.
                      "I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever be-
                    fore me. Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this
                    evil in thy sight" (verses 3, 4).
                      Without recognition of one's sinful state, without sincere
                    confession of one's transgressions, there can be no forgive-
                    ness. "David's repentance was sincere and deep. There was no
                    effort to palliate his crime. No desire to escape the judgments
                    threatened, inspired his prayer. . . . It was not for pardon only
                    that he prayed, but for purity of heart."—Patriarchs and
                    Prophets, p. 725.

                       2. One must desire to receive truth with all one's heart.

                       "Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward being; therefore
                     teach me wisdom in my secret heart" (verse 6, RSV).
                       God uses truth to sanctify us; "thy word is truth" (John 17:17).
                     On the one hand, by revealing our sins to us, God's Word
                     permits us to see ourselves as we are (see James 1:23, 24); on
                     the other hand, it shows us what we can become by His grace.

                       3. One must ask God to create in him a new heart.

                       "Create in me a clean heart, 0 God; and renew a right spirit
                     within me" (verse 10).
                       God does not wish merely to tidy the heart; He desires to
                     create anew one, as He promises in Ezekiel 36:26: "A new heart
                     also will I give you."

                       4. One must offer himself to God as a living sacrifice.

                       "The sacrifice acceptable to God is a broken spirit; a broken
                     and contrite heart, 0 God, thou wilt not despise" (verse 17,
                     RSV).
                       What counts in God's eyes is not the exterior aspects of
                     holiness, but the inner dispositions of the heart and mind. When
                     these are not what they should be, all the sacrifices and cere-
                     monies, even prayer itself, are an abomination to God. (See Ise.
                     1:11-17.)

The Pure in Heart        LESSON 7                                     ❑ Thursday
                                                                     November 13
           Part 5     What marvelous promise does the Lord make with regard to
      GOD'S LAW     the condition of the believer under the new covenant?
      WRITTEN IN      "This is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel
      THE HEART     after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their
                    mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a
                    God, and they shall be to me a people" (Heb. 8:10).

                       "At Mt. Sinai the Lord wrote His laws on tables of stone (Deut.
                    4:13), and in a book (ch. 31:24, 26). He intended that these laws
                    should also be written on the hearts of the people. But the
                    Israelites were content to regard these statutes simply as an
                    external code and their observance a matter of outward com-
                    pliance. God did not intend that His laws should be thus re-
                    garded. He offered His people the experience of a new heart ... ,
                    but they were content with only an external religion. Under the
                    new covenant men's hearts and minds are changed.... Men do
                    right, not by their own strength, but because Christ dwells in the
                    heart, living out His life in the believer.... They are born of the
                    Spirit and bear the fruits of the Spirit (Gal. 5:22, 23). The change
                    can be effected only by divine power. Only God can 'put' His law
                    in the hearts of His followers, though, of course, not without
                    man's consent and cooperation (Rev. 22:17 ...)."—S.D.A. Bible
                    Commentary, vol. 7, p. 446.

                      What should characterize the life and activities of a genuine
                    Christian? Deut. 4:29; 6:5; Col. 3:23.

                      God is not pleased with a divided heart, halfhearted service,
                    occasional piety, diluted Christianity. God demands all or
                    nothing. "I would thou wert cold or hot. So then because thou
                    art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of
                    my mouth" (Rev. 3:15, 16).

THINK IT THROUGH      To give one's heart to God means simply to submit one's will
                    to the will of God.

                       "You cannot change your heart, you cannot of yourself give
                    to God its affections; but you can choose to serve Him. You can
                    give Him your will; He will then work in you to will and to do
                    according to His good pleasure. Thus your whole nature will be
                    brought under the control of the Spirit of Christ; your affections
                    will be centered upon Him, your thoughts will be in harmony
                    with Him."—Steps to Christ, p. 47.

The Pure in Heart       LESSON 7                                         ❑ Friday
                                                                      November 14
          Part 6     What promise is made to the pure in heart? How should this
     THEY SHALL    promise be understood?
        SEE GOD
                     "Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God"
                   (Matt. 5:8).

                        "By faith we behold Him here and, now. In our daily experi-
                     ence we discern His goodness and compassion in the manifes-
                     tation of His providence. We recognize Him in the character of
                     His Son. The Holy Spirit takes the truth concerning God and Him
                     whom He hath sent, and opens it to the understanding and to
                     the heart. The pure in heart see God in 'a new and endearing
                     relation, as their Redeemer; and while they discern the purity
                     and loveliness of His character, they long to reflect His image.
                   - They see Him as a Father longing to embrace a repenting son,
                     and their hearts are filled with joy unspeakable and full of glory.
                        "The pure in heart discern the Creator in the works of His
                     mighty hand, in the things of beauty that comprise the universe.
                     In His written word they read in clearer lines the revelation of His
                     mercy, His goodness, and His grace.... We discern the truth by
                     becoming, ourselves,-partakers of the divine nature.
                        "The pure in heart live as in the visible presence of God during
                     the time He apportions them in this world."—Thoughts From
                    the Mount of Blessing, pp. 26, 27.

                     What are two happy results in this life of contemplating the
                   glory of God? 2 Cor. 3:18.

                     "It is the Holy Spirit, the Comforter, which Jesus said He
                   would send into the world, that changes our character into the
                   image of Christ; and when this is accomplished, we reflect:as in
                   a mirror, the glory of the. Lord."—Ellen G. White Comments,
                   S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1097.

THINK IT THROUGH      How is it possible to contemplate the Lord's glory?

                     "Beholding Christ means studying His life as, given 'in His
                   Word. We are to dig for truth as for hidden treasure. We are to fix
                   our eyes upon Christ. . . . By beholding we become changed,
                   morally assimilated to the One who is perfect in character. By
                   receiving His imputed righteousness, through the transforming
                   power of the Holy Spirit, we become like Him. The image of
                   Christ is cherished, and it captivates the whole being."—Ellen

                                           development. Here we find
  Interestingly, in considering the        enumerated the principles that
seventh beatitude, theologians in          assure the moral growth of every
particular have asked themselves if it     human being—principles and laws
was not directed especially to             with universal scope. All are called to
Christ's disciples. Evidence denies        receive this divine teaching, but only
this. For instance, the prologue to        those who are prepared to realize it
the Sermon on the Mount clearly            in their lives are the ones who fulfill
states that Jesus addressed Himself        the conditions outlined in the
to the multitudes.                         preceding beatitudes.
                                               This truth is evident in the fact that
                                           performance of this beatitude is
                                           possible only as the provisions
                                           described in the preceding
                                          'beatitudes are achieved. It is
                                           impossible to be an instrument of
                                           peace in the world, a "maker of
                                           peace" after the example of Jesus
                                           Himself, unless "the peace of God,
                                           which passeth all understanding,"
                                           fills "your hearts and minds" with the

                                           47).
                                               Just as Christ came to the world as
                                           a peacemaker, to reconcile all who
                                           are in heaven and on earth, just so
                                            His disciples are called to become
                                            "makers of peace" among men. In
                                            doing this they will receive the

                                            which is reserved for those whom
                                            the Lord will one day usher into the

The Peacemakers           LESSON 8                                       ❑ Sunday
                                                                       November 16
             Part 1     What is the meaning of the word "peacemaker" as it was
         MAKERS OF    used by Jesus?
             PEACE
                         The word used in the original Greek is not found elsewhere in
                      the Bible, although the verb "to make peace" is often used.
                      Scholars have been unable to determine the Aramaic expres-
                      sion equivalent to this composite word. But as the Aramaic
                      spoken in Palestine in Christ's time was akin to the Hebrew,
                      doubtless Jesus employed a word with Semitic connotations.
                         "In order to appreciate what Christ meant when He spoke of
                      'peacemakers' it is helpful to take note of the meaning of peace
                      in Semitic thinking and speech. The Hebrew equivalent of the
                      Greek eirene is shalom, meaning 'completeness,' soundness,'
                      'prosperity,' condition of well-being.' "—S.D.A. Bible Com-
                      mentary, vol. 5, p. 328.

                        According to Jesus, what name will be given to those who
                      are peacemakers? Matt. 5:9.

                        To be called "children of God" means, strictly speaking, to be
                      "sons of God." God is the "God of peace" (Rom. 15:33); Jesus,
                      the "Prince of Peace." It seems natural, then, that those who, in
                      God's name, work for peace in this world should be called
                      "children of God."
                        "To be a son of God means to resemble Him in character
                      (1 John 3:2; cf. John 8:44). 'Peacemakers' are the 'sons of God'
                      because they are at peace with Him themselves, and are de-
                      voted to the cause of leading their fellow men to be at peace
                      with Him."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 328.

THINK IT THROUGH        Is it possible for men to bring about peace? If not, why not?

                         "The peace of Christ is born of truth. It is harmony with God.
                      The world is at enmity with the law of God; sinners are at enmity
                      with their Maker; and as a result they are at enmity with one
                      another. But the psalmist declares, 'Great peace have they
                      which love Thy law: and nothing shall offend them.' Ps. 119:165.
                      Men cannot manufacture peace. Human plans for the purifica-
                      tion and uplifting of individuals or of society will fail of produc-
                      ing peace, because they do not reach the heart. The only power
                      that can create or perpetuate true peace is the grace of Christ.
                      When this is implanted in the heart, it will cast out the evil
                      passions that cause strife and dissension. 'Instead of the thorn
                      shall come up the fir tree, and instead of the brier shall come up
                      the myrtle tree;' and life's desert 'shall rejoice, and blossom as
                      the rose.' Ise. 55:13; 35:1."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 302-305.

The Peacemakers        LESSON 8                                     El Monday
                                                                   November 17
          Part 2   What does the Bible teach concerning relations between
      CHILDREN God and man?
      OF WRATH
                   "We all . were by nature the children of wrath, even as
                 others" (Eph. 2:3).
                   "Once you were alienated from God and were enemies in
                 your minds because of your evil behavior" (Col. 1:21, NIV).
                     In yielding to temptation and being disobedient to God in
                   Eden, man took his stand against the Creator of the universe,
                   against God's established order, against the laws of life. At the
                   same time he placed himself on the side of the "prince of the
                   power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of
                   disobedience" (Eph. 2:2).
                     As a natural consequence, relations between God and His
                   earthly creatures were broken. After sin man first fled from
                   God's presence out of fear, then because of a lack of interest in
                   heavenly things, and finally out of hatred for the God they no
                   longer knew or, worse, whose very name filled them with anger.
                   And, speaking of the "children of disobedience," the apostle
                   Paul adds, "among whom also we all .. were by nature" (Eph.
                   2:3).
                     No one can say that he is an exception. We are all by nature
                   "children of wrath," consciously or unconsciously, in a state of
                   war against God, lined up under the banner of the "prince of this
                   world." "Whosoever . . will be a friend of the world is the enemy
                   of God," because "the friendship of the world is enmity with.
                   God" (James 4:4).

                     How does man's rebellion against God manifest itself? Titus
                   3:3.
                     Enmity between 'God and man reveals itself on the spiritual
                   level, with far-reaching consequences in man's life generally.
                   By his thoughts and works man becomes a stranger and an
                   enemy of God. By doing what he pleases rather than following
                   God's will, he becomes "a son of disobedience," introducing
                   into his own life—and into the world—disorder,' envy, hatred,
                   violence, strife, suffering, and death.

THINK IT THROUGH     In carefully examining the list of the "works of the flesh," as
                   drawn up by the apostle Paul, are you confident that you have
                   won the battle of life?
                      "Now the works of the flesh are plain: fornication, impurity,
                   licentiousness, idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, anger,
                   selfishness, dissension, party spirit, envy, drunkenness, carous-
                   ing, and the like. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those
                   who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God" (Gal.
                   5:19-21, RSV).

                                                                   November 18

          Part 3     What title did Paul freely attribute to God?
       THE GOD
       OF PEACE      "The God of peace be with you all" (Rom. 15:33).
                     "The God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet
                   shortly" (Rom. 16:20).
                     "God is not the author of confusion, but of peace" (1 Cor.
                   14:33).

                      In the beginning of Israel's history Gideon built an altar unto
                   the Lord, which he named "Jehovahshalom" (Judges 6:24)—
                   "The Lord is peace" (RSV). Most of the Bible authors used this
                   title in one way or another, either to call upon "the God of
                   peace," or to greet one another, or to bless, or still to call to
                   order and peace.
                       "God is not a being who either has in Himself or produces
                   disorder, disunion, discord, or confusion.... He is the God of
                   peace, and it is not to be taught that He could be pleased by a
                   form of worship characterized by confusion of any kind. . .
                   Christianity tends to promote order (see 1 Cor. 14:40)."—S.D.A.
                   Bible Commentary, vol. 6, pp. 792, 793.

                     Why is the title "God of peace" a just one? Col. 1:20; Rom.
                   5:8, 10.

                      Before the foundation of the world God conceived the plan by
                   Which He would establish peace, not only on earth with man, but
                   also in heaven among the heavenly hosts. God arranged for the
                   reestablishing of peace wherever there was war against Him in
                   the universe.
                      God did not wait until we approached Him to heal the breach
                   and make peace. It was He who took the initiative: "While we
                   were yet sinners, ... when we were enemies, we were reconciled
                   to God" (Rom. 5:8-10). "All things are of.God, who hath recon-
                   ciled ... the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses
                   unto them" (2 Cor. 5:18, 19).

THINK IT THROUGH    The parable of the lost sheep aptly illustrates the fact that
                   God took the initiative in the quest and the reconciliation.

                     "It was taught by the Jews that before God's love is extended
                   to the sinner, he must first repent. In their view, repentance is a
                   work by which men earn the favor of Heaven.... According to
                   their ideas He should permit none to approach Him but those
                   who had repented. But in the parable of the lost sheep, Christ
                   teaches that salvation does not come through our seeking after
                   God but through God's seeking after us."—Christ's Object Les-

                                                                    November 19
          Part 4     Through what means did God bring about peace with man?
         CHRIST
      OUR PEACE      "In him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell, and
                   through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether on
                   earth or in heaven, making peace by the blood of his cross"
                   (Col. 1:19, 20, RSV).
                     "For he [Christ] is our peace" (Eph. 2:14).

                     Our reconciliation with God was effected through Jesus
                   Christ. He in person was the instrument of our peace with God.
                   "Being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our
                   Lord Jesus Christ" (Rom. 5:1). God established "peace through
                   the blood of his cross" (Col. 1:20). The redemptive work of
                   Christ is completely contained in the word "peace."
                     "Christ came that He might give peace to us such as the world
                   knows not and cannot offer (John 14:27). This 'peace of God,
                   which passeth all understanding, shall keep' our 'hearts and
                   minds through Christ Jesus' (Phil. 4:7). When Christ enters the
                   heart it is always with the words, 'Peace be unto you' (Luke
                   24:36)."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 693.

                     Which of the Messiah's characteristics was announced by
                   prophecy and acclaimed at the time of His advent? Isa. 9:6;
                   Luke 2:14.

                     "Christ is the 'good will' of God incarnate. He is the 'Prince of
                   Peace' (Isa. 9:6), the One who proclaimed, 'Peace I leave with
                   you. . . . Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid'
                   (John 14:27). As the result of His coming it is our privilege to
                   'have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ' (Rom.
                   5:1)."--S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 700.

THINK IT THROUGH     Harmony with God, likeness to Him—what can you do to
                   obtain It?

                     "It is peace that you need—Heaven's forgiveness and peace
                   and love in the soul. Money cannot buy it, intellect cannot
                   procure it, wisdom cannot attain to it; you can never hope, by
                   your own efforts, to secure it. But God offers it to you as a gift,
                   'without money and without price.' Isaiah 55:1. It is yours if you
                   will but reach out your hand and grasp it. The Lord says,
                   'Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow;
                   though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.' Isaiah
                   1:18. 'A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put
                   within you.' Ezekiel 36:26."—Steps to Christ, p. 49.

The Peacemakers        LESSON 8                                    ❑ Thursday
                                                                  November 20
          Part 5    Experiencing the peace of Christ bears three kinds of fruit.
     THE FRUITS    What are they?
       OF PEACE
                     1.Peace with God: "You, who were dead in trespasses ... ,
                   God made alive together with him, having forgiven us all our
                   trespasses, having canceled the bond which stood against us
                   with its legal demands; this he set aside, nailing it to the
                   cross" (Col. 2:13, 14, RSV). (Compare Rom. 8:1.)

                     The prophet Isaiah had prophesied it in these words: "The
                   chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes
                   we are healed" (53:5). Reconciled, we no longer live in fear, and
                   "the Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are
                   children of God: . . heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ"
                   (Rom. 8:16, 17).

                      2. Peace with oneself: "The law of the Spirit of life in Christ
                   Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.... For
                   to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is
                   life and peace" (Rom. 8:2-6).

                      "To set the mind on the things of the Spirit, and to have the
                   thoughts and desires governed solely by the Spirit of God, result
                   in that healthful, life-giving harmony of all the functions of the
                   soul that is a sure pledge and foretaste of the life to come...
                   The presence of the Holy Spirit brings love, joy, and peace in the
                   life (Gal. 5:22), the beginning within us of the kingdom of God,
                   which is 'righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost'
                   (Rom. 14:17)."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 563.

                    3. Peace with others: "If it be possible, as much as lieth in
                   you, live peaceably with all men" (Rom. 12:18).

                     The peace of God—because it is perfect—manifests itself in
                   our relations with one another. This is why preaching of the
                   gospel of peace demands that we "live in peace" (2 Cor. 13:11),
                   "follow . . . peace" (2 Tim. 2:22), and "strive for peace with all
                   men" (Heb. 12:14, RSV).

THINK IT THROUGH     "The peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall

                     "There is no other ground of peace than this. The grace of

The Peacemakers        LESSON 8                                        ❑ Friday
                                                                    November 21
          Part 6   To be a "peacemaker," what extraordinary demand is made
      BECOMING of Christians?
      CHILDREN
        OF GOD     "Ye have heard that it hath been said; Thou shalt love thy
                 neighbour, and hate thine enemy. But I say unto you, Love
                 your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that
                 hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and
                 persecute you" (Matt. 5:43, 44).

                     "The children of God are those who are partakers of His
                   nature. It is not earthly rank, nor birth, nor nationality, nor
                   religious privilege, which proves that we are members of the
                   family of God; it is love, a love that embraces all humanity. Even
                   sinners whose hearts'are not utterly closed to God's Spirit, will
                   respond to kindness; while they may give hate for hate, they will
                   also give love for love. But it is only the Spirit of God that gives
                   love for hatred. To be kind to the unthankful and to the evil, to do
                   good hoping for nothing again, is the insignia of the royalty of
                   heaven, the sure token by which the children of the Highest
                   reveal their high estate."—Thoughts From the Mount of Bless-
                   ing, p. 75.

                     To what end should those who have received God's peace
                   direct all their efforts? Rom. 14:19; James 3:18.

                      "Christ's followers are sent to the world with the message of
                   peace. Whoever, by the quiet, unconscious influence of a holy
                   life, shall reveal the love of Christ; whoever, by word or deed,
                   shall lead anotherto renounce sin and yield his heart to God, is a
                   peacemaker.
                      "And 'blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called
                   the children of God.' The spirit of peace is evidence of their
                   connection with heaven. The sweet savor of Christ surrounds
                   them. The fragrance of the life, the loveliness of the character,
                   reveal to the world the fact that they are children of God. Men
                   take knowledge of them that they have been with Jesus.
                   'Everyone that loveth is born of God.' 'If any man have not the
                   Spirit of Christ, he is none of His;' but 'as many as are led by the
                   Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.' 1 John 4:7; Romans 8:9,
                   14."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 28.

THINK IT THROUGH     According to the prophecy of the apostle Paul, what will
                   happen when men "shall say, Peace and safety"?

                     "Then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon
                   a woman with child; and they shall not escape" (1 Thess. 5:3).

                       the subjects of Satan's kingdom, and the prince of evil is
                       aroused to resist it. Persecution and reproach await all who are

                       Blessing, p. 29.
                          "The same enmity is manifested toward Christ's followers as
                       was manifested toward their Master. Whoever sees the repul-
                       sive character of sin, and in strength from above resists tempta-
                       tion, will assuredly arouse the wrath of Satan and his subjects.
                       Hatred of the pure principles of truth, and reproach and perse-
                       cution of its advocates, will exist as long as sin and sinners
                       remain. The followers of Christ and the servants of Satan cannot
                       harmonize. The offense of the cross has not ceased."—The
                       Great Controversy, p. 507.

                         What did Paul consider was his duty in preparing the
                       churches for persecution? Acts 14:22.

                         The declaration that appears here is a statement that Luke
                       must have heard many times from Paul's lips, and which he
                       faithfully reported in the first person plural, although he had not
                       yet been in Lystra, Iconium, or Antioch.

THINK IT THROUGH         "Why is it, then, that persecution seems in a great degree to
                       slumber?"

                          This important question is asked by the author of The Great
                       Controversy on page 48 of that book. Her response should make
                       us think. It follows:
                          "The only reason is that the church has conformed to the
                       world's standard and therefore awakens no opposition.... It is
                       only because of the spirit of compromise with sin, because the
                       great truths of the word of God are so indifferently regarded,
                       because there is so little vital godliness in the church, that
                       Christianity is apparently so popular with the world. Let there be
                       a revival of the faith and power of the early church, and the spirit
                       of. persecution will be revived, and the fires of persecution will
                       be rekindled."—The Great Controversy, p. 48.

The Persecuted      LESSON 9                                     ❑ Wednesday
                                                                  November 26
         Part 4   Only under what conditions can persecution be considered
    REPROACHED as a reason to rejoice?
   FOR CHRIST'S
          NAME    "If you are reproached for the name of Christ, you are
                blessed, because the spirit of glory and of God rests upon you.
                   . If one suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but
                under that name let him glorify God" (1 Peter 4:14-16, RSV).

                     As Jesus stated in the eighth beatitude, only he who is perse-
                   cuted for righteousness' sake can know the joy that comes from
                   above in spite of the trial. The satisfaction that the persecuted
                   Christian enjoys comes to him because he is a partaker of
                   "Christ's sufferings" (v. 13), because he knows that he is suffer-
                   ing as a Christian, and because he has proof that the "spirit of
                   glory and of God rests" on him.
                     In apostolic times the name Christian was possibly first given
                   to ridicule those who followed Christ. That is why the apostle
                   Peter exhorts Christians not to be ashamed, but rather to glory.
                   And that is exactly what happened. Christians of the first cen-
                   turies brought glory to Christ by being persecuted for His sake.

                     What more is said concerning affliction for the sake of con-
                   science as opposed to every other motive? 1 Peter 2:19-21;
                   4:15.

                      If it is a Christian grace to suffer unjustly for the sake of
                   conscience, it is, on the contrary, a terrible disgrace—and a
                   reproach for the cause of God—to suffer as a "murderer, or as a
                   thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters"
                   (v. 15). As this is a matter of the Christian's relations with non-
                   Christians, the meaning of the word "busybody" tells us that a
                   Christian should not make himself conscience.for another. It is
                   enough that he conducts himself without reproach before God
                   and man.
                                •
THINK IT THROUGH      Precisely what attitude should one have toward persecu-
                   tion? Should one flee from it or strive for it?

                     "None should disobey His [the Lord's] command in order to
                   escape persecution. But let all consider the words of Christ:
                   'When they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another.'
                   Matthew 10:23. If it can be avoided, do not put yourselves into
                   the power of men who are worked by'the spirit of antichrist.
                   Everything that we can do should be done that those who are
                   willing to suffer for the truth's sake may be saved from oppres-
                   sion and cruelty."—Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 230.

         TESTIMONY
                        "This will be a time for you to bear testimony" (Luke 21:13,
                       RSV). (Compare Mark 13:9.)
                          If it is wrong to seek persecution, it is certainly a greater
                       mistake to believe that God brings it about for the good of His
                       children and the progress of His work. God never causes evil,
                       nor does He ever wish it for His children. But as, where sin
                       abounds, grace much more abounds (Rom. 5:20); so, where
                       persecution rages, God accords grace to endure and to triumph
                       in order that testimony may be borne to truth.

                         What experiences in Paul's life illustrate the principle ex-
                       pressed by Jesus? Phil. 1:12-14; Acts 16:22-34.
                          "God means that truth shall be brought to the front and
                        become the subject of examination and discussion, even
                       through the contempt placed upon it. The minds of the people
                       must be agitated; every controversy, every reproach, every ef-

                         The first persecution of the church at Jerusalem is a typical
                       example of the way God uses the enemy's ambush to ac-
                       complish His purposes. (See Acts 8:1, 4; 11:19-21.)
                         "In vain were Satan's efforts to destroy the church of Christ by
                       violence. The great controversy in which the disciples of Jesus
                       yielded up their lives did not cease when these faithful
                       standard-bearers fell at their post. By defeat they conquered.
                       God's workmen were slain, but His work went steadily forward.
                       The gospel continued to spread and the number of its adherents
                       to increase. It penetrated into regions that were inaccessible
                       even to the eagles of Rome. Said a Christian, expostulating with
                       the heathen rulers who were urging forward the persecution:
                       You may 'kill us, torture us, condemn us.... Your injustice is the
                       proof that we are innocent.... The oftener we are mown down
                       by you, the more in number we grow; the blood of Christians is
                       seed.'—Tertullian, Apology."—The Great Controversy, pp. 41,
                       42.

THINK IT THROUGH         Do you know any examples of the entering of the gospel into
                       a country, a region, a city, or a family despite obstacles, or
                       thanks to them?

          Part 6     What marvelous promise does the eighth beatitude contain
     "THEIR'S IS   for those persecuted for righteousness' sake?
   THE KINGDOM
    OF HEAVEN"       "Their's is the kingdom of heaven" (Matt. 5:10).
                     "This is evidence of the righteous judgment of God, that you
                   may be made worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you are
                   suffering" (2 Thess. 1:5, RSV).

                     "The same promise [is] made in v. 3 [of Matthew 5] to those
                   who sense their spiritual need. 'If we suffer, we shall also reign
                   with him' (2 Tim. 2:12; cf. Dan. 7:18, 27). Those who suffer most
                   for Christ here are best able to appreciate what He suffered for
                   them. It is appropriate that the first and last beatitudes should
                   contain the assurance of membership in the kingdom."—S.D.A.

                   were suffering persecution and tribulation? 2 Thess. 1:4-7.

                     "In his second letter Paul sought to correct their misun-
                   derstanding of his teaching and to set before them his true
                   position. He again expressed his confidence in their integrity,
                   and his gratitude that their faith was strong, and that their love
                   abounded for one another and for the cause of their Master. He
                   told them that he presented them to other churches as an ex-
                   ample of the patient, persevering faith that bravely withstands
                   persecution and tribulation, and he carried their minds forward
                   to the time of,the second coming of Christ, when the people of
                   God shall rest from all their cares and perplexities."—The Acts

THINK IT THROUGH     Even though the promises of Jesus contained in the
                   Beatitudes are already being partially fulfilled in this life, their
                   perfect realization will not take place until the glorious advent
                   of our Lord Jesus Christ.

                      "Look up, look up, and let your faith continually increase. Let
                   this faith guide you along the narrow path that leads through the
                   gates of the city of God into the great beyond, the wide, un-
                   bounded future of glory that is for the redeemed. 'Be patient

"When Men Shall Revile You"                 LESSON 10                     ❑ Sunday
                                                                        November 30
             Part 1      What attitude should the persecuted believer possess?
             HAPPY
           ARE YOU      "Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute
                      you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my
                      sake" (Matt. 5:11).

                         The true cause of the happiness of those whom Jesus de-
                      clared "blessed" is not found in themselves. Rather it is in the
                      Lord's promise to them. In each beatitude Jesus stated the
                      reason for happiness in the second part of the declaration. The
                      poor in spirit, they that mourn, those who hunger and thirst, the
                      persecuted—all are blessed because Jesus is able to promise
                      them the kingdom of heaven, consolation, satisfaction, the title
                      "son of God," a vision of God.
                         Clearly, persecution itself cannot be a cause for rejoicing for
                      those who suffer. The apostles did not glory in the furnace,
                      trials, tribulations. Persecution was of no value as a meritorious
                      experience. The happiness of the persecuted Christian has its
                      source in Christ. He is happy who is reviled, persecuted, or
                      falsely accused "for my sake," Jesus specified, or "for my
                      name's sake" (Luke 21:12), "because the spirit of glory and of
                      God rests upon you" and because you suffer "as a Christian"
                      (1 Peter 4:14, 16, RSV).

                       What are two reasons for rejoicing, according to Jesus?
                      Matt. 5:12.

                        The Beatitudes have already outlined the recompense for
                      suffering during the earthly phase of the Messianic kingdom.
                      The Master now indicates the place of the reward: "Great is your
                      reward in heaven." Only in the kingdom of heaven will the
                      redeemed receive the reward that the Lord has prepared for
                      them.
                        The second reason indicated here is found in the comparison
                      made with the prophets. He who is persecuted, as were the
                      prophets, can count on receiving the same recompense re-
                      served for the prophets. "And these all, having obtained a good
                      report through faith, received not the promise: God having
                      provided some better thing for us, that they without us should
                      not be made perfect" (Heb. 11:39, 40).

THINK IT THROUGH       Is there better proof, for me as for others, that I am one of
                      Christ's disciples?

                        "Far from causing grief, persecution should bring joy to the
                      disciples of Christ, for it is an evidence that they are following in
                      the steps of their Master."—Thoughts From the Mount of Bless-

"When Men Shall Revile You"              LESSON 10                      ❑ Monday
                                                                       December 1
          Part 2   What was the general attitude of men toward God's mes-
    THE PARABLE sengers in Christ's parable of the vineyard?
         OF THE
      VINEYARD     "The husbandmen took his servants, and beat, one, and
                 killed another, and stoned another."
                   "When the husbandmen saw the son, they said among
                 themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us
                 seize on his inheritance" (Matt. 21:35, 38). (See also verses
                 33-41.)

                     This parable proves the infinite patience and goodness of
                   God toward men, at the same time that it points out man's
                   ingratitude and cruelty. True, this parable was directed espe-
                   cially to the Israelites, but it also illustrates the general attitude
                   of men toward God's messengers.
                     Stephen's literal application of this truth in his discourse
                   resulted in his being stoned. He said, "Which of the prophets
                   did not your fathers persecute? And they killed those who an-
                   nounced beforehand the coming of the Righteous One, whom
                   you have now betrayed and murdered" (Acts 7:52, RSV).

                    What did Jesus say was the attitude of the scribes and
                   Pharisees toward the prophets? Matt. 23:29-35.

                     "The gems of truth that fell from Christ's lips on that eventful
                   day [when He pronounced woe on the scribes and Pharisees]
                   were treasured in many hearts. For them new thoughts started
                   into life, new aspirations were awakened, and a new history
                   began. After the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ, these
                   persons came to the front, and fulfilled their divine commission
                   with a wisdom and zeal corresponding to the greatness of the
                   work.... Mighty were the results flowing from the words of the
                   Saviour to that wondering, awestruck crowd in the temple at
                   Jerusalem."—The Desire of Ages, p. 620.

THINK IT THROUGH     There is no more effective testimony in favor of truth than
                   that of men and women ready to give their lives for it.

                     "When the noble and eloquent Stephen was stoned to death
                   at the instigation of the Sanhedrin council, there was no loss to
                   the cause of the gospel. The light of heaven that glorified his
                   face, the divine compassion breathed in his dying prayer, were
                   as a sharp arrow of conviction to the bigoted Sanhedrist who
                   stood by, and Saul, the persecuting Pharisee, became a chosen
                   vessel to bear the name of Christ before Gentiles and kings and
                   the children of Israel."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing,

                      "In their case the god of this world has blinded the minds of
                    the unbelievers, to keep them from seeing the light of the
                    gospel of the glory of Christ" (2 Cor. 4:4, RSV).
                      "The hour is coming when whoever kills you will think he is
                    offering service to God" (John 16:2, RSV).

                       Those persecuted for righteousness' sake have unanimously
                    pleaded extenuating circumstances for their persecutors.
                    Jesus set the example when on the cross He prayed, "Father,
                    forgive them; for they know not what they do" (Luke 23:34).
                    After openly accusing his audience of having "killed the Prince
                    of life," Peter, for his part, added, "Now, brethren, I wot that
                    through ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers" (Acts 3:15,
                    17).
                       Speaking from experience, the apostle Paul explained that if
                    "the princes of this world" had known "the wisdom of God,"
                    "they would not have crucified the Lord of glory" (1 Cor. 2:6-8).
                    No one knew better than Paul how easily religious prejudice can
                    lead to violence. "I myself was convinced that I ought to do
                    many things in opposing the name of Jesus of Nazareth" (Acts
                    26:9, RSV).

                      Who is actually responsible for the constant war against
                    God's people throughout history?.Matt. 22:3-6; John 13:27;
                    2 Thess. 2:9; Eph. 6:11, 12.
                      Just as there is the mystery of godliness to designate the
                    incomprehensible work of God on the heart of man, there is also
                    a mystery of iniquity to indicate the work, no less mysterious, of
                    him whom the Bible calls "the Devil" and "Satan." He is the
                    antichrist, the great adversary of God's children. When he can-
                    not defeat them by violence, he tries to seduce them through
                    miracles.

THINK IT THROUGH     What is the difference, essentially, between God's work on
                    men to make them His instruments and the work of Satan?
                      "God never forces the will or the conscience; but Satan's
                    constant resort—to gain control of those whom he cannot
                    otherwise seduce—is compulsion by cruelty. Through fear or
                    force he endeavors to rule the conscience and to secure hom-
                    age to himself. To accomplish this, he works through both
                    religious and secular authorities, moving them to the enforce-

       KINGDOM prevailed against them; until the Ancient of days came, and
                 judgment was given to the saints of the most High."
                   "He shall speak great words against the most High, and
                 shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change
                 times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a
                 time and times and the dividing of time" (Dan. 7:21, 22, 25).

                      If, as the prophet Amos affirmed, "the Lord God will do noth-
                    ing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets"
                    (Amos 3:7), God would surely reveal the trouble that awaited His
                    people throughout history. With mathematical precision God
                    did unveil the 120 years of papal.persecution to Daniel. Seven
                    times this prophetic period is mentioned in the Bible (Dan. 7:25;
                    12:7; Rev. 11:2, 3; 12:6, 14; 13:5), each time in connection with
                    the war that the powers of darkness would wage against God's
                    people. In His prophetic discourse Jesus also alluded to this
                    dramatic time in the history of the Christian church. (See Matt.
                    24:8-10.)

                      What assurance does prophecy give concerning the out-
                    come of this war? Dan. 7:22, 27, 18.

                      "All earthly kings and governments will pass away, but the
                    kingdom of the Most High will endure forever. The usurpation
                    and misrule of the wicked may last for atime, but soon it will be
                    at an end. Then this earth will be restored to its rightful Owner,
                    who will share it with the•saints. Those who have long been
                    destitute and despised by men will soon be honored and exalted
                    by God."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 4, p. 830.

                    cut short the time of their fiery trial. In foretelling the 'great
                    tribulation' to befall the church, the Saviour said: 'Except those
                    days should be shortened; there should no flesh be saved; but
                    for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened.' Matthew

                     making attractive and preserving the values of the kingdom of
                     God in society. Jesus had just enunciated the operating princi-
                     ples of God's government in heaven as well as on earth. All
                     those who claimed to be friends of God had the responsibility of
                     living these principles as well as sharing them with their non-
                     believing friends.

                       What lesson may we learn from the fact that salt must be
                     added to food before it can be effective? How does Luke 14
                     support this idea?
                       Ellen White makes this comment about Jesus' style of
                     evangelism: "His work was largely made up of personal inter-
                     views. He had a faithful regard for the one-soul audience.
                     Through that one soul the message was -often extended to
                     thousands."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 229.
                       Jesus took areal risk in coming to the world as a man. Are we
                     willing to take the real risks involved in getting close to indi-
                     viduals who haven't heard the truth about the kind of person
                     God is and the kinds of values He stands for?

                        How does Jesus' use of the salt metaphor help us refine our
                     ideas about missions and evangelism? (See Paul's descrip-
                     tion of his evangelism in 1 Corinthians 9:22.)
                       "In Christ's parable teaching the same principle is seen as in
                     His own mission to the world. That we might become ac-
                     quainted with His divine character and life, Christ took our
                     nature and dwelt among us.... So it was in Christ's teaching:
                     the unknown was illustrated by the known; divine truths by
                     earthly things with which the people were most familiar."—
                     Christ's Object Lessons, p. 17.
                       Surely there is a lesson in God's great effort to meet men and
                     women on a level that they could understand. The very idea of
                     God becoming man should challenge us to make certain that
                     our evangelistic outreach is understandable and attractive in
                     today's world.
THINK IT THROUGH        What does it tell us about God that His Son, a perfect revela-
                     tion of Him, made imaginative use of parables and metaphors
                     to reach men and women?

"Ye Are the Salt"      LESSON 11                                      ❑ Monday
                                                                     December 8

          Part 2     What lack in Israel brought God's rebuke?
   THE PROBLEM
       OF FAITH-     "Hear the word of the Lord, ye children of Israel: for the Lord
        FULNESS    hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because
                   there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land"
                   (Hosea 4:1).

                     How may we avoid becoming as savorless salt? From the
                   beginning peoples who have been set aside to be special repre-
                   sentatives of God have had a problem keeping God at the center
                   of their faith.

                     What conditions in the Laodicean church are equivalent to
                   savorless salt? Rev. 3:15-17.

                     In 1889 Ellen White wrote: "The message to the Laodicean
                   church is applicable to our condition. How plainly is pictured
                   the position of those who think they have all the truth, who take
                   pride in their knowledge of the Word of God, while its sanctify-
                   ing power has not been felt in their lives."—Ellen G. White
                   Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 961.
                     In 1898 Ellen White wrote: "Those who live for self are ranged
                   under the head of the Laodicean church who are lukewarm,
                   neither cold nor hot. The ardor of the first love has lapsed into a
                   selfish egotism. . . . There may be a wonderful appearance for
                   zeal and ceremonies, but this is the substance of their self-
                   inflated religion."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible
                   Commentary, vol. 7, p. 962.
                     What would Ellen White write if she were alive today?

                      Why is the salt that has lost its savor worse than no salt at
                   all? What do Hosea 4:4-6 and Matthew 23:1-3 teach about this
                   principle?

                      "If Christians are such in name only, they are like the salt that
                   has lost its savor. They have no influence for good in the world.
                   Through their misrepresentation of God they are worse than
                   unbelievers."—The Desire of Ages, p. 306.
                      Very religious people can, through their "misrepresentations
                   of God" (their refusal to believe that God is as gracious as
                   Jesus) do great damage to the very truths they cherish. The
                   practical solution is always to ask a question of any inspired
                   literature—What does this say about God?

THINK IT THROUGH     The Laodicean message describes church members who
                   have become selfish; how can we apply this in not only a
                   material but a spiritual sense?

"Ye Are the Salt"         LESSON 11                                       ❑ Tuesday
                                                                          December 9
             Part 3   In what sense should believers be more loving than non-
            SALT IS believers?
           LOVE-1
                      "I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse
                    you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which
                    despitefully use you, and persecute you."
                      "If ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than
                    others? do not even the publicans so?" (Matt. 5:44, 47).

                       Ellen White identifies salt with love (Thoughts From the
                     Mount of Blessing, p. 36), but she goes on to define it as a
                     special kind of love (see p. 38). It is the ability to love the
                     unlovable; it is intelligent love—active and imaginative love.

                       How does Jesus' love make it possible to love the unlov-
                     able? 1 John 4:11, 12.

                        "Love is not simply an impulse, a transitory emotion, depen-
                     dent upon circumstances; it is a living principle, a permanent
                     power.... The children of God love one another, truly, sincerely,
                     unaffectedly—`without partiality, and without hypocrisy.' . . .
                     Our affection for one another springs from our common rela-
                     tion to God. We are one family, we love one another as He loved
                     us. When compared with this true, sanctified, disciplined affec-
                     tion, the shallow courtesy of the world, the meaningless expres-
                     sions of effusive friendship, are as chaff to the wheat."—Ellen
                     G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 1140.

                       What dimension of Christian love makes it so effective in
                     this broken world? 1 Cor. 13:4-8.

                         "Love is power. Intellectual and moral strength are involved
                     in this principle, and cannot be separated from it. The power of
                     wealth has a tendency to corrupt and destroy; the power of
                     force is strong to do hurt; but the excellence and value of pure
                     love consist in its efficiency to do good, and to do nothing else
                     than good. . . .
                            .. Wherever the power of intellect, of authority, or of force is
                     employed, and love is not manifestly present, the affections and
                     will of those whom we seek to reach assume a defensive, repel-
                     ling position, and their strength of resistance is increased."—
                     Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 135.
                        It is no wonder that Ellen White suggested that we read
                     1 Corinthians 13 on a daily basis.

THINK IT THROUGH       Do I love the unlovable? Is my self-confidence based on
                     worldly status or on the knowledge that I am accepted as a
                     son or a daughter of God?

"Ye Are the Salt"      LESSON 11                                  ❑  Wednesday
                                                                    December 10
          Part 4      What does our failure to be loving (the "salt of the earth")
         SALT IS    show about our relationship with God?
        LOVE-2
                      "He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love"
                    (1 John 4:8).

                      In part 3 of this lesson we considered Jesus' efforts at refining
                    man's understanding of what it means to love his fellowman.
                    Happily, our Lord also renewed the vertical definition of love,
                    that is the love between an individual and God.

                      What efforts that duplicate his appeal to Eve does Satan
                    make today to produce savorless salt in God's church? Gen.
                    3:4, 5.

                      "From the beginning it has been Satan's studied plan to
                    cause men to forget God, that he might secure them to himself.
                    Therefore he has sought to misrepresent the character of God,
                    to lead men to cherish a false conception of Him. The Creator
                    has been presented to their minds as clothed with the attributes
                    of the prince of evil himself—as arbitrary, severe, and unfor-
                    giving—that He might be feared, shunned, and even hated by
                    men. . . .
                      "Christ came to reveal God to the world as a God of love, a
                    God of mercy, tenderness, and compassion."—In Heavenly
                    Places, p. 8.

                      How would you relate Jesus' words to Philip (John 14:9) with
                    the serpent's words to Eve (Gen. 3:4, 5)?

                       In a spirit of humility Jesus was constantly encouraging His
                    disciples to think of God in terms of the example of His own
                    everyday life. The disciples had difficulty accepting this. Simply
                    put, the gospel says that God is as nice as Jesus. To be truly
                    Christian is to make Jesus normative for all we think and say
                    about God and heaven. "Had God the Father come to our world
                    and dwelt among us, humbling Himself, veiling His glory, that
                    humanity might look upon Him, the history that we have of the
                    life of Christ would not have been changed.... In every act of
                    Jesus, in every lesson of His instruction, we are to see and hear
                    and recognize God. In sight, in hearing, in effect, it is the voice
                    and movements of the Father."—That 1 May Know Him, p. 338.

 THINK IT THROUGH     Has Jesus' life become normative for what I think about my
                    heavenly Father?

                                                                      December 11
             Part 5   How does Christianity, devoutly lived, give evidence of
     SALT "PROVES" God's existence?
            GOD'S
        EXISTENCE     "As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also
                    sent them into the world" (John 17:18).

                        The late-in-life reconverted British journalist Malcolm
                     Muggeridge once sat observing pilgrims file through the tradi-
                     tional birthplace of Christ in Bethlehem. He noticed the
                     cameras, the garish sport shirts, the postcards and tourist
                     bric-a-brac. But he also noticed the silence and the look upon
                     the faces, and he contrasted this reverence with the great
                     tragedies we read about in the newspapers every day and con-
                     cluded that it took something divine to set something as magni-
                     ficent as Christianity in motion, and it takes something divine to
                     sustain it. Not conclusive proof, but certainly evidence of the
                     existence of a loving God.

                      What should the reality of the Christian church say about
                     God? John 17:21, 23.

                       "Christians who are purified through the truth will possess
                     saving qualities that preserve the world from utter moral
                     corruption."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 36.

                       What reaction can faithful Christians expect as they work to
                     uphold the kingdom of heaven in this world? John 15:20.

                         It is true that the world loves sin and hates righteousness. And
                     it is equally true that we are not to withdraw from the world in
                     order to escape persecution. (See The Desire of Ages, p. 306.)
                     But have we considered the problems the remnant will have
                     with professedly religious people? Remember that Jesus died
                     at the hands of fellow "believers." "The darkest chapters of
                     history are burdened with the record of crimes committed by
                     bigoted religionists. The Pharisees claimed to be children of
                     Abraham, and boasted of their possession of the oracles of
                     God; yet these advantages did not preserve them from selfish-
                     ness, malignity, greed for gain, and the basest hypocrisy."—The
                     Desire of Ages, p. 309.

THINK IT THROUGH        Have we squared all our beliefs with the life of Christ, or do
                     we cherish ideas that are not in harmony with the spirit of His
                     life?

                                                                         December 12
            Part 6     How may God serve as our example in presenting the truth?
          JESUS,
         SALT OF       "Love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for
       THE EARTH     nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be
                     the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful
                     and to the evil" (Luke 6:35).

                        The Sermon on the Mount, addressed primarily to the disci-
                     ples, was to help them turn in a direction much different from
                     the one they had traveled all their lives. It is a gentle, yet specific,
                     summary of the values that pervade heaven. Instead of an out-
                     right attack on the disciples' ideas, Jesus was tactfully offering
                     as an alternative the truth about God and about heaven and
                     about the responsibilities of God's children.

                       What method did Jesus use when dealing with men seeking
                     to trick Him? Luke 10:29-37.

                        Note the comment Ellen White makes about those to whom
                     Jesus told the parable of the Good Samaritan: "He [Jesus) did
                     not denounce the bigotry of those who were watching to con-
                     demn Him. But by a simple story He held up before His hearers
                     such a picture of the outflowing of heaven-born love as touched
                     all hearts, and drew from the lawyer a confession of the truth.
                        "The way to dispel darkness is to admit light. The best way to
                     deal with error is to present truth. It is the revelation of God's
                     love that makes manifest the deformity and sin of the heart
                     centered in self."—The Desire of Ages, p. 498.

                       How personal was the appeal of Christ's preaching? What

                        By dwelling on the truth instead of giving consistent attention
                     to error, Jesus won His way into many of the hearts of His
                     hearers.
                        "When Jesus spoke, it was not with hesitating uncertainty,
                     with repetition of words and familiar figures. The truth came
                     from his lips clothed in new and interesting representations that
                     gave it the freshness of a new revelation. His voice was never
                     pitched to an unnatural key, and his words came with an ear-

                    and men loved darkness rather than light, because their
                    deeds were evil" (John 3:19).

                        In order to light the world effectively, God's people must
                      understand what constitutes the spiritual, darkness of their
                      world. In order to establish evangelistic priorities, we need to
                      consider what the Bible and the spirit of prophecy have singled
                      out as the world's main problem.

                        How is darkness defined by Paul in Romans 1:19-25?

                        Let us refer back to a cornerstone passage in The Desire of
                      Ages as we attempt to set priorities for witnessing to our non-
                      Adventist friends. "The earth was dark through misapprehen-
                      sion of God. That the gloomy shadows might be lightened, that
                      the world might be brought back to God, Satan's deceptive
                      power was to be broken. . . . To know God is to love Him; His
                      character must be manifested in contrast to the character of
                      Satan. This work only one Being in all the universe could do.
                      Only He who knew the height and depth of the love of God could
                      make it known."—The Desire of Ages, p. 22.

                        What does Paul say most sinners have chosen instead of
                      the revelation of God's character? Rom. 1:26-31.

                        Unhappily, relatively few people in every generation have
                     accepted Jesus' revelation of God's love. Few have been willing
                     to accept Jesus' life as evidence that the law of God—the value
                     system that sustains the universe—offers the best possible way
                     of living. "As the evil passions and purposes of men banished
                     God from their thoughts, so forgetfulness of Him inclined them
                     more strongly to evil. The heart in love with sin clothed Him with
                     its own attributes, and this conception strengthened the power
                     of sin. Bent on self-pleasing, men came to regard God as such a
                     one as themselves—a Being whose aim was self-glory, whose
                     requirements were suited to His own pleasure; a Being by whom
                     men were lifted up or cast down according as they helped or
                     hindered His selfish purpose."—Education, p. 75.

THINK IT THROUGH       Are our personal witnessing efforts articulately directed at
                     the main problem facing men and women—the problem of
                     depreciating the values God stands for?

"Ye Are the Light"       LESSON 12                                      ❑Monday
                                                                     December 15
           Part 2     In what sense are Christians the light of the world?
     THE SYMBOL
        OF LIGHT      "God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness,
                    hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of
                    the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ" (2 Cor. 4:6).

                      Clearly, Christians are the light of the world only in the sense
                    of service and not in the sense of having something which
                    draws attention to themselves or even their church. Even as
                    they are reflectors rather than sources of light, they should seek
                    to draw the attention of the world, not to themselves, but to
                    heaven.

                      What did Jesus mean when He referred to His disciples as
                    the light of the world? Matt. 5:14.

                       As she did at the very outset of her book on the Sermon on the
                    Mount, Ellen White encourages us to consider the context of
                    Jesus' remark about believers' being the light of the world.
                    Clearly, the servant of the Lord wants us to avoid making the
                    same mistake our spiritual ancestors made. She said: "The
                    people had come together while it was yet morning. The glori-
                    ous sun, climbing higher and higher in the blue sky, was chas-
                    ing away the shadows that lurked in the valleys and among the
                    narrow defiles of the mountains. . . .
                       "No other light ever has shone or ever will shine upon fallen
                    man save that which emanates from Christ. Jesus, the Saviour,
                    is the only light that can illuminate the darkness of a world lying
                    in sin."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, pp. 38, 39.
                       Consider the impact Jesus had on His hearers, when they
                    could see shadows disappearing at the very moment they were
                    listening to the Saviour. The message was plain; consecrated
                    individuals would clear away misconceptions that had enslaved
                    the world.

                      Are we really the light of the world? 1 John 1:5.

                      More properly, we are reflectors of the Light of the world. "As
                    Christ is the channel for the revelation of the Father, so we are to
                    be the channel for the revelation of Christ. . . . The church of
                    Christ, every individual disciple of the Master, is heaven's ap-
                    pointed channel for the revelation of God to men."—Thoughts

         WORKS        "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your
                    good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven" (Matt.
                    5:16).

                        Ever since the fall of mankind, the human family has needed a
                    point of reference to check the trustworthiness of God's values
                    and requirements. Being the guardian of freedom that He is,
                    God does not ask men and women to do anything without first
                    giving them evidence of His love and concern for them. Hence,
                    He has always sought to have a people who would communi-
                    cate His love, thus demonstrating His trustworthiness. In mod-
                    ern times the word works has come to have a negative connota-
                    tion because it is often associated with pride and the attempt to
                    earn salvation by obligating God. Actually works is a good word,
                    if it means, for instance, demonstrating the benefits of living our
                    God's ideals.

                      Was Jesus taking a risk in encouraging His disciples to let
                    the world see their good works? Matt. 23:5.

                       "In like manner the disciples of Christ are set as light bearers
                    on the way to heaven; through them the Father's mercy and
                    goodness are made manifest to a world enshrouded in the
                    darkness of misapprehension of God. By seeing their good
                    works, others are led to glorify the Father who is above; for it is
                    made manifest that there is a God on the throne of the universe
                    whose character is worthy of praise and imitation."—Thoughts
                    From the Mount of Blessing, p. 41.
                       "Let us remember that a Christlike life is the most powerful
                    argument that can be advanced in favor of Christianity.... Men
                    will believe, not what the minister preaches, but what the
                    church lives. Too often the influence of the sermon preached
                    from the pulpit is counteracted by the sermon preached in the
                    lives of those who claim to be advocates of truth."—

          Part 4     How may we glorify God, who is all glory?
       GLORIFY
   YOUR FATHER       "I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work
                   which thou gayest me to do" (John 17:4). (Read also verses 5,
                   6.)

                      By revealing God, Jesus glorified God. The highest compli-
                   ment that can be paid any person is that he or she speaks well of
                   God. (See Job 42:7.) Often God is portrayed as being like an
                   earthly despot who demands praise and adulation from his
                   subjects. But Jesus' life cancels this picture, for in it we see God
                   wanting nothing more from created beings than that they know
                   and share His love for them.
                      What does the Bible mean when it refers to God's glory? "The
                   word of God reveals His character. He Himself has declared His
                   infinite love and pity. When Moses prayed, 'Show me Thy glory,'
                   the Lord answered, 'I will make all My goodness pass before
                   thee.' Exodus 33:18, 19. This is His glory."—Steps to Christ, p.
                   10. If God's glory equals His character, then the process of
                   glorifying God amounts to speaking well of His character by
                   faithfully living out His principles in our lives. Glorifying God
                   means worshiping Him as our Friend and Saviour rather than as
                   a harsh and tyrannical ruler.
                      "Satan led men to conceive of God as a being whose chief
                   attribute is stern justice,—one who is a severe judge, a harsh,
                   exacting creditor. He pictured the Creator as a being who is
                   watching with jealous eye to discern the errors and mistakes of
                   men, that He may visit judgments upon them. It was to remove
                   this dark shadow, by revealing to the world the infinite love of
                   God, that Jesus came to live among men."—Steps to Christ, p.
                   11.

                    Is it sufficient for our Christian experience just to admire
                   God? 2 Cor. 5:11, 14.

                     Actually true admiration for God involves a compulsion to
                   share what we know to be true about Him with others. Indif-
                   ferent admiration is not admiration at all. Ellen White reminds
                   us, "We are not only to contemplate the glory of Christ, but also
                   to speak of His excellences. Isaiah not only beheld the glory of
                   Christ, but he also spoke of Him.... Who can by faith behold the
                   wonderful plan of redemption, the glory of the only-begotten
                   Son of God, and not speak of it?"—Thoughts From the Mount of

      CONFIDENCE       "Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel,
                     but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the
                     house" (Matt. 5:15).

                       We cannot give what we do not have. We need to study God's
                     Word in order to be effective witnesses for Him in this world.
                     What is more, life is not static. From day to day we become more
                     and more like the things and people we think about and admire.

                       How can we know the way of salvation? 2 Tim. 3:15.

                       "It is a law of the mind that it gradually adapts itself to the
                     subjects upon which it is trained to dwell. If occupied with

                     power the Bible is without a rival."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p.
                     596.
                       As church members, what we really need is firm confidence in
                     the fact that a study of the Bible, contemplating the stories
                     recorded there, will refine and polish us. Such study will groom
                     our tastes and improve our ability to converse with people.

                      What did Jesus teach that God was willing and able to do?
                     Matt. 7:11.

                       The initial sin in heaven was disbelief about the goodness and
                     wisdom of God. In the end, those who would be saved must
                     develop precisely the opposite attitude. They, like Job, must be
                     absolutely, unmovably certain that God is wise and fair and
                     loving, that He asks only of them what is for their best good.
                     They must be sealed: "It is not any seal or mark that can be seen,
                     but a settling into the truth, both intellectually and spiritually, so
                     they cannot be moved."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A.
                     Bible Commentary, vol. 4, p. 1161. We cannot acquire this level
                     of confidence in God and in our Saviour without giving consis-

                     the Bible and in the pages of the spirit of prophecy.

      A QUALITY
      OF PEOPLE     "I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of
                   God more than burnt offerings" (Hosea 6:6).

                     Some religions speak of sanctifying things, places, animals,
                   seasons, and heroes of the past, while the character develop-
                   ment of living believers virtually is ignored. Not so with
                   Seventh-day Adventist Christianity, for it is about people—
                   people who are becoming more Christlike all the time.

                     What ongoing process are believers to experience? 2 Cor.
                   3:18.

                      Adventists are not ashamed of emphasizing Christlike
                   change. They ask, Is it not reasonable to want to change and be
                   gracious? Sanctification has nothing to do with earning salva-
                   tion. It has everything to do with admiring the obedience, the
                   sense of humility, and the effective service displayed so vividly
                   in Christ's life. "Trials patiently borne, blessings gratefully re-
                   ceived, temptations manfully resisted, meekness, kindness,
                   mercy, and love habitually revealed, are the lights that shine
                   forth in the character in contrast with the darkness of the selfish
                   heart, into which the light of life has never shone."—Thoughts
                   From the Mount of Blessing. p. 44. Does not a person of this
                   quality have an enviable life-style?

                     How does the process of Christlike change occur? 2 Peter
                   1:3, 4.

                      "It is not by looking away from Him that we imitate the life of
                   Jesus, but by talking of Him, by dwelling upon His perfections,
                   by seeking to refine the taste and elevate the character, by
                   trying—through faith and love, and by earnest, persevering
                   effort—to approach the perfect Pattern. By having a knowledge
                   of Christ—His words, His habits, and His lessons of
                   instruction—we borrow the virtues of the character we have so
                   closely studied, and become imbued with the spirit we have so
                   much admired."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible

              Part 1   How do we know which gate to enter? Consider Proverbs
      WHAT YOU SEE 14:12.
       IS NOT WHAT
           YOU GET     "There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end
                     thereof are the ways of death" (Prov. 14:12).

                        Choice and taste play a large part in our ability to live a
                      Christlike life. The more these are indulged selfishly, the more
                      difficult it is to perceive the right decision in any given situation.
                      This is what happened to the Pharisees. Unbeknown to them,
                      Satan had substituted his values and characteristics to the point
                      that they behaved more satanically when they thought they
                      were doing God's will.

                        Psalm 1 speaks of the same principles as the illustration of
                      the two gates. What does it indicate that makes one way
                      pleasurable and the other one painful?

                         God respects freedom, but there are consequences to our
                      acts. "All along the road that leads to death there are pains and
                      penalties, there are sorrows and disappointments, there are
                      warnings not to go on. God's love has made it hard for the
                      heedless and headstrong to destroy themselves."—Thoughts
                      From the Mount of Blessing, p. 139.
                         On the contrary, the narrow road may be very rewarding.
                      "God does not require us to give up anything that it is for our
                      best interest to retain. . . .
                         "It is a mistake to entertain the thought that God is pleased to
                      see His children suffer. All heaven is interested in the happiness
                      of man. Our heavenly Father does not close the avenues of joy to
                      any of His creatures. The divine requirements call upon us to
                      shun those indulgences that would bring suffering and disap-
                      pointment, that would close to us the door of happiness and
                      heaven."—Steps to Christ, p. 46.

                       What thoughts do you find in Colossians 3:1, 2 that point out
                      what helps us choose the right gate?

                         Speaking of Jacob's all-night struggle with the angel, Ellen
                      White says, "Jacob, in the great crisis of his life, turned aside to

         Part 2  Why is it important to have a correct understanding of God
         THINK and Jesus?
        THINGS   "This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true
       THROUGH God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent" (John 17:3).

                     Heaven will be populated with people who have a variety of
                   opinions on given doctrines. Each individual has specific
                   spiritual needs; each will emphasize a different aspect of a
                   given doctrine. However, these varied emphases will all fit on a
                   spectrum of truthful Bible interpretation. It matters, for in-
                   stance, that we believe in the mortal nature of man and the
                   resurrection rather than in the immortality of the soul.

                     What thought in Luke 24:25-27, 44-48 helps us understand
                   what the correct interpretation of Scripture has to do with
                   entering the gate of life?

                     "In the road to death the whole race may go, with all their
                   worldliness, all their selfishness, all their pride, dishonesty, and
                   moral debasement. There is room for every man's opinions and
                   doctrines, space to follow his inclinations, to do whatever his
                   self-love may dictate. In order to go in the path that leads to
                   destruction, there is no need of searching for the way; for the
                   gate is wide."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 138.
                     In the wide gate it not only doesn't matter what we think, it
                   happens not to matter whether we think at all.
                      "Satan is constantly endeavoring to attract attention to man
                   in the place of God. He leads the people to look to bishops, to
                   pastors, to professors of theology, as their guides, instead of
                   searching the Scriptures to learn their duty for themselves."—
                   The Great Controversy, p. 595.

                     Why does it matter that we understand Christian doctrine?
                   John 8:32.

                      "The position that it is of no consequence what men believe is
                   one of Satan's most successful deceptions. He knows that the
                   truth, received in the love of it, sanctif ies the soul of the receiver;
                   therefore he is constantly seeking to substitute false theories,
                   fables, another gospel."—The Great Controversy, p. 520.

                   lives.

                                                                         December 23
              Part 3      What is the relation of self-discipline to salvation?
      SELF-CONTROL
        IS REQUIRED      "He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is
                       broken down, and without walls" (Prov. 25:28).

                          The Christian's argument against such phenomena as drugs,
                       alcohol, hypnotism, and spiritualism rests in a belief that these
                       violate an individual's ability for self-determination. The poten-
                       tial for personal fulfillment is related to the amount of self-
                       discipline one has. The Christian finds success in self-discipline
                       by surrender of his will to God.

                         How does the will help us in our battle against sin? Phil. 2:13.

                          "The Christian life is a battle and a march. But the victory to be
                       gaindd is not won by human power. The field of conflict is the
                       domain of the heart. The battle which we have to fight—the
                       greatest battle that was ever fought by man—is the surrender of
                       self to the will of God, the yielding of the heart to the sovereignty
                       of love. The old nature, born of blood and of the will of the flesh,
                       cannot inherit the kingdom of God. The hereditary tendencies,
                       the former habits, must be given up."—Thoughts From the
                       Mount of Blessing, p. 141.

                         Will self-control eliminate sin in our lives? Rom. 7:15-20.

                           Christians are divided as to whether Romans 7 describes a
                       pre- or post-conversion state. However, almost all agree that
                       sanctification is the work of a lifetime. Certainly all the self-
                       control in the world without a relationship of dependence upon
                       God is of little ultimate value. But God understands this. "When
                       it is in the heart to obey God, when efforts are put forth to this
                       end, Jesus accepts this disposition and effort as man's best
                       service, and He makes up for the deficiency with His own divine
                       merit. But He will not accept those who claim to have faith in
                       Him, and yet are disloyal to His Father's commandment. We
                       hear a great deal about faith, but we need to hear a great deal
                       more about works. Many are deceiving their own souls by living
                       an easy-going, accommodating, crossless religion."—Selected

The Two Gates       LESSON 13                                       ❑ Wednesday
                                                                     December 24
          Part 4    In what sense should Christians strive to be saved?
       STRIVERS
                     "Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you,
                   will seek to enter in, and shall not be able" (Luke 13:24).
                      We live in a time of de-emphasis on striving to keep God's law.
                   Yet Luke says, "Strive [Greek: agonizomai]!" Commenting on
                   this, Ellen White suggests: "I have stated before them that, from
                   what was shown me, but a small number of those now profess-
                   ing to believe the truth would eventually be saved—not because
                   they could not be saved, but because they would not be saved in
                   God's own appointed way. The way marked out by our divine
                   Lord is too narrow and the gate too strait to admit them while
                   grasping the world or while cherishing selfishness or sin of any
                   kind. . .
                      "The words of Christ are plain: 'Strive [agonize] to enter in at
                   the strait gate.' "—Testimonies, vol. 2, pp. 445, 446.

                     What prevents striving after righteousness from being mere
                   salvation by works? Phil. 1:21.

                     "Day by day, and hour by hour, there must be a vigorous
                   process of self-denial and of sanctification going on within; and
                   then the outward works will testify that Jesus is abiding in the
                   heart by faith.... Strive, but let it be in the strength of your risen
                   Saviour."—Fundamentals of Christian Education, pp. 136, 137.

                     What do Micah 6:8 and 7:7-9 say that can help us under-
                   stand how we can strive and yet remain absolutely dependent
                   upon God?
                      "The victory is not won without much earnest prayer, without
                   the humbling of self at every step. Our will is not to be forced
                   into co-operation with divine agencies, but it must be voluntar-
                   ily submitted. Were it possible to force upon you with a hun-
                   dredfold greater intensity the influence of the Spirit of God, it
                   would not make you a Christian, a fit subject for heaven."—
                   Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 142.
                      We must be convinced that Christ offers a blueprint for living.
                   We must want to be like Him. We must be fascinated by His
                   life-style more than by the life-styles of the world's celebrities
                   and heroes.

THINK IT THROUGH     Am I convinced that Jesus' life displays values that are
                   effective in today's world?

The Two Gates       LESSON 13                                         ❑ Thursday
                                                                     December 25
          Part 5     What did Jesus say that helps us see the result of squeezing
        FREE TO    through the narrow gate?
      BE MYSELF
                     "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I
                    will give you rest" (Matt. 11:28).

                     It is paradoxical but true that the denial of self enhances
                   personal freedom and therefore peace and satisfaction. Not
                   that the denial of self means living a shriveled and shallow life;
                   on the contrary, "the development of all our powers is the first
                   duty we owe to God and to our fellow men."—Christ's Object
                   Lessons, p. 329.
                     The narrow gate is the gate of self-worth, the wide one of
                   selfishness. There is a vast difference between the two.

                    From Philippians 2:3, what can we pinpoint as the cause of
                   most of our problems?

                      "There are many whose hearts are aching under a load of care
                   because they seek to reach the world's standard. They have
                   chosen its service, accepted its perplexities, adopted its cus-
                   toms. Thus their character is marred, and their life made a
                   weariness. In order to gratify ambition and worldly desires, they
                   wound the conscience, and bring upon themselves an addi-
                   tional burden of remorse. The continual worry is wearing out,
                   the life forces. . . .
                      "It is the love of self that brings unrest. . . . The value of our
                   work does not consist in making a show and noise in the world,
                   and in being active and zealous in our own strength."—The
                   Desire of Ages, pp. 330, 331.

                     What is the best way to rid our lives of selfishness? Matt.
                   16:24.

                     "Whatever your anxieties and trials, spread out your case
                   before the-Lord. . . The way will be opened for you to disen-1
                   tangle yourself from embarrassment and difficulty. The weaken
                   and more helpless you know yourself to be, the stronger will you
                   become in His strength. . . .
                     "In the heart of Christ, where reigned perfect harmony with
                   God, there was perfect peace. He was never elated by applause,
                   nor dejected by censure or disappointment. . . .
                     " ... When our will is swallowed up in the will of God, and we
                   use His gifts to bless others, we shall find life's burden light."—
                   The Desire of Ages, pp. 329-331.

THINK IT THROUGH     Consider how much of our personal difficulties and embar-
                   rassments are the results of self-assertion.

the Two Gates      LESSON 13                                          ❑ Friday
                                                                   December 26
          Part 6     How does Jesus help us through the narrow gate?
    JESUS LEADS
        THE WAY      "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life:
                   no man cometh unto the Father, but by me" (John 14:6).

                     One of the great principles of Christianity is that God wouldn't
                   ask His friends to do anything He would not do. Jesus' life
                   reveals this to be true. God only asks of His creatures what is for
                   their best possible good. But for many this concept is difficult to
                   accept. Few have believed Christ's words, "He that hath seen
                   me hath seen the Father." Few have transferred what they think
                   about the Son to what they think about the Father.

                     In what way does Jesus guarantee the quality of God's
                   value system or message? John 17:6-8.

                     "If we ever attain unto holiness, it will be through the renunci-
                   ation of self and the reception of the mind of Ch rist."—
                   Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 143.
                     Jesus lived God's values. By accepting, as Ellen White
                   suggests, the "mind of Christ," we accept His confidence in the
                   values of the kingdom of God.
                     Note this gracious warning: "He who feels whole, who thinks
                   that he is reasonably good, and is contented with his condition,
                   does not seek to become a partaker of the grace and righteous-
                   ness of Christ."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 7.
                     "There are many in the broad way who are not fully satisfied
                   with the path in which they walk. . . . They look toward the
                   narrow way and the strait gate; but selfish pleasure, love of the
                   world, pride, unsanctified ambition, place a barrier between
                   them and the Saviour.... They desire the good, they make some
                   effort to obtain it; but they do not choose it; they have not a
                   settled purpose to secure it at the cost of all things."—Thoughts
                   From the Mount of Blessing, p. 143.

                     In what sense does Jesus bring the kingdom of heaven to
                   fulfillment for us in this life? John 15:15, 16.

                     "As through Jesus we enter into rest, heaven begins here. We
                   respond to His invitation, Come, learn of Me, and in thus coming
                   we begin the life eternal. Heaven is a ceaseless approaching to
                   God through Christ."—The Desire of. Ages, p. 331.

THINK IT THROUGH     Have I accepted Jesus' life as evidence that the principles
                   Jesus enumerated in the Sermon on the Mount represent the
                   best way to live?
