 Sabbath School Members
 World Divisions of the
    Seventh-day Adventist Church

 Dear Members:

      I am pleased to bring you greetings from the 451,329
 Sabbath School members in North America. We, your brothers
 and sisters, feel very close to you in the work of the gospel
 as we approach the day of His coming.

       Some do not think of North America as having any special
  needs, but there.is on this continent a great variety of chal-
  lenging situations.

       For instance, there is the Northeastern Academy, an inner
  city institution serving the needs of a large number of black
  youth. The great need here is for additional vocational train-
  ing classrooms.

       Then there is the great challenge of Quebec, one of the
  largest French-speaking communities in the world. We must
  train indigenous talent to work for their own people in this
  difficult area of endeavor. To establish a French-speaking
  academy of Montreal is the priority item for the church in
  Quebec.

       The American Indian has been strangely neglected. We
  have done some work among these true native Americans but
  not nearly enough. Your Thirteenth Sabbath offering will
  help to expand the outpatient clinic at Monument Valley
  Hospital in the Nevada-Utah Conference and assist in the
  financing and equipping of the Pine Ridge School vocational
  arts building in South Dakota.

       May I take this opportunity to thank you for your gener-
  ous support of the North American Thirteenth Sabbath projects
  in the past. It is the liberal soul that is blessed and en-
  riched. Heaven's law of reciprocity wills it so.

                            Sincerely yours,



                            C. E. Bradford

                  THE WITNESS OF JESUS
                                    INTRODUCTION

  The Sabbath School lessons this quarter are devoted to the study of the testimony
of Jesus as revealed in the book of Revelation. They are not an exhaustive study of the
entire book, but rather a careful examination of the prophetic messages that the
faithful and true Witness addresses to His church, exhorting her to bear her testimony
during every period of her history, from the apostolic age to the end of time.
   Particular attention is given to the messages that directly concern us today: first,
the one addressed to the church of Laodicea and then those of the three angels of
Revelation 14. Pioneers of the advent movement studied these messages profoundly
and systematically. Their faith and their testimony depend upon that study. Is that not
also true today?
   "Many have entertained the idea that the book of Revelation is a sealed book, and
they will not devote time and study to its mysteries. They say that they are to keep
looking to the glories of salvation, and that the mysteries revealed to John on the Isle
of Patmos are worthy of less consideration than these. But God does not so regard
this book. . . .
   "     It should be studied with reverential awe."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A.
Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 954.
   "Let none think, because they cannot explain the meaning of every symbol in the
Revelation, that it is useless for them to search this book in an effort to know the
meaning of the truth it contains. The One who revealed these mysteries to John will
give the diligent searcher for truth a foretaste of heavenly things. Those whose hearts
are open to the reception of truth will be enabled to understand its teachings, and will
be granted the blessing promised to those who 'hear the words of this prophecy, and
keep those things which are written therein.' "—The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 584,
585.
   The finishing of God's work on earth, which was entrusted to the remnant church,
depends upon our understanding of the testimony of Jesus and upon our fidelity in
proclaiming God's last message for humanity as revealed in the three angels' mes-
sages of Revelation 14. In order for our understanding to grow, we must study it over
 and over again. Only in this way can we render an effective testimony.
   "When we as a people understand what this book [Revelation) means to us, there
 will be seen among us a great revival."—Testimonies to Ministers, p. 113.

Patmos and Jesus Christ, the faithful
and true Witness. It is also as the
faithful and true Witness that Jesus
delivers His message to the church of
Laodicea, and, finally, when He
appears sitting upon a white horse as
King of kings and Lord of lords, His
name is given as "Faithful and True"
(Rev. 19:11).
   All the work of Christ bears the
hallmark of incomparable fidelity.
Speaking of the faithfulness of Moses,
the author of the Epistle to the
Hebrews says, "Now Moses was
faithful in all- God's house as a servant,
to testify to the things that were to be
spoken later, but," he adds, "Christ
was faithful over God's house as a son.
And we are his house if we hold fast
our confidence and pride in our hope"
(Heb. 3:5, 6, RSV).

                                                                          March 30
             Part 1   What unique title does the book of Revelation give to Jesus
       THE FAITHFUL Christ?
         AND TRUE
          WITNESS     "From Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness" (Rev. 1:5).
                      "These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness"
                    (Rev. 3:14).

                        The Revelation is the only book in the New Testament that
                      gives the title of "witness" to our Lord. Jesus is the perfect
                      witness, the only authentic and true witness. All other witnesses
                      named in the Bible are cited because of their connection with
                      Jesus. They are not simply called "witnesses," but "witness of
                      Jesus."

                        Of whom is Jesus the faithful and true witness? In what
                      sense? John 1:18; 1 John 5:20.

                         By nature Jesus is God's authentic witness. He is "the bright-
                      ness of his glory, and the express image of his person" (Heb.
                     1:3). Being the true expression of the nature of God, Jesus alone
                      is able to reveal the only true God, of whom He is the perfect
                     expression of His character, His mind, His will. "If ye had known
                     me," Jesus said, "ye should have known my Father also.... He
                     that hath seen me hath seen the Father" (John 14:7-9).
                         "He [Christ] is the manifestation of the Father, and is called
                     the Word of God. God sent His Son into the world, His divinity
                      clothed wjth humanity, that man might bear the image of the
                      invisible God. He made known in His words, His character, His
                     power and majesty, the nature and attributes of God. Divinity
                     flashed through humanity in softening, subduing light. He was
                     the embodiment of the law of God, which is the transcript of His
                     character."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commen-
                     tary, vol. 5, p. 1131.

THINK IT THROUGH       To what extent is Jesus the source of knowledge for me
                     concerning the only true God?

                       "Neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to
                     whomsoever the Son will reveal him" (Matt. 11:27). "I am not
                     come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.
                     But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me" (John
                     7:28, 29). "I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh
                     unto the Father, but by me. If ye had known me, ye should have
                     known my Father also" (John 14:6, 7).

             Part 2     For what purpose did Jesus come into this world?
          WITNESS
         OF TRUTH      "To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the
                      world, that I should bear witness unto the truth" (John 18:37).

                        As the authentic and true witness, the testimony of Jesus can
                      only pertain to truth. "John frequently ... uses the word [truth]
                      in a wider sense to denote what is true in things pertaining to
                      God and the duties of man, or in a more restricted sense the
                      facts taught in the Christian religion concerning God and the
                      execution of His purposes through Christ. This revelation had
                      been given by Jesus (ch. 1:17). He, in fact, was 'the truth' (ch.
                      14:6). He was 'full of grace and truth' (ch. 1:14)."—S.D.A. Bible
                      Commentary, vol. 5, pp. 989, 990.
                         "In His life, Christ's words had perfect illustration and sup-
                      port. And more than this; what He taught, He was. His words
                      were the expression, not only of His own life experience, but of
                      His own character. Not only did He teach the truth, but He was
                      the truth."—Education, pp. 78, 79.

                        Where, today, as in former times, do we find witness borne
                      to Jesus and to truth? John 5:39; 17:17.

                        The close relationship between Jesus and the Scriptures is
                      not sufficiently emphasized. To the one as to the other, the Bible
                      gives the name "Word of God." Whereas Christ is the Word of
                      God made human flesh, the Scriptures are the Word of God in
                      human language. Divinely inspired, the Written Word is only a
                      means. Its testimony leads to a knowledge of the Living Word of
                      God. Actually the witness and the testimony are inseparable—
                      Christ is revealed to us through the Scriptures, and the Scrip-
                      tures are given to reveal Jesus Christ to us.

THINK IT THROUGH       To what extent is the witness of Jesus, borne by the Written
                      Word, the foundation of my spiritual life?

                        "The great principles of the law, of the very nature of God, are
                      embodied in the words of Christ on the mount. Whoever builds
                      upon them is building upon Christ, the Rock of Ages. In receiv-
                      ing the word, we receive Christ. And only those who thus receive
                      His words are building upon Him. 'Other foundation can no man
                      lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.' 1 Corinthians 3:11.
                      'There is none other name under heaven, given among men,
                      whereby we must be saved.' Acts 4:12. Christ, the Word, the
                      revelation of God,—the manifestation of His character, His law,
                      His love, His life,—is the only foundation upon which we can
                      build a character that will end u re."—Thoughts From the Mount

              Part 3     What is inherent in the witness of God expressed in Jesus?
       THE WITNESS
            OF GOD        "This is the witness of God which he hath testified of his
                       Son. He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in
                       himself. ... And this is the record, that God hath given to us
                       eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath
                       life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life" (1 John
                       5:9-12).
                          He who confesses the deity of Jesus receives the testimony of
                       God. In this way God imparts to him the very life of the Son.
                       Gospel truth becomes his truth, the premise of his life. The
                       object of the divine witness is our quickening through commun-
                       ion with the Son of God. To him who believes His testimony God
                       gives the eternal life that is in His Son. From that moment he
                       shares the life that proceeds from the Father through the unique
                       Mediator of life, Jesus Christ.
                          "Only the believer in Christ can receive life everlasting. Only
                       by continually feeding on Christ's flesh and blood can we have
                       the assurance that we are partakers of the divine nature. No one
                       should be indifferent on this subject, saying, If we are honest, it
                       is no matter what we believe. You cannot with safety surrender
                       any seed of vital truth in order to please yourself or anybody
                       else. Do not seek to avoid the cross. If we receive no light from
                       the Sun of Righteousness, we have no connection with the
                       Source of all light; and if this life and light do not abide in us, we
                       can never be saved."—Selected Messages, bk. 1, p. 299.

                         What promise is made to him who receives the testimony
                       borne by Jesus? John 1:12, 13.
                         "John here brands as error the belief that simply because
                       Christ died for all men, all will therefore be saved. Marked
                       equally false is the belief that God predestines certain men to be
                       saved and others to be damned. John emphatically declares
                       that the decisive factor lies with men themselves—`as many' as
                       receive and believe are granted access to sonship."—S.D.A.

THINK IT THROUGH         Can I say with Paul, "For to me to live is Christ"?
                          "This is the most perfect interpretation in a few words, in all
                       the Scriptures, of what it means to be a Christian. This is the
                       whole truth of the gospel. Paul understood what many seem
                       unable to comprehend. How intensely in earnest he was! His
                       words show that his mind was centered in Christ, that his whole
                       life was bound up with his Lord. Christ was the author, the
                       support, and the source of his life."—Ellen G. White Comments,

                                                              April 2
          Part 4     What are other effects of the testimony of Jesus in the life of
     THE POWER     the believer?
         OF GOD
                      The testimony of Jesus as presented to us in the Gospels, and
                   in all Scripture, is truly "the power of God unto salvation to
                   every one that believeth" (Rom. 1:16). Under the imperceptible
                   influence of the Spirit, the Written Word becomes the instru-
                   ment by which God effects .the salvation of man, the sword of
                   the Spirit by which He persuades the sinner to pass from death
                   unto life.
                      Here are 10 ways in which God's Word brings about transfor-
                   mation in the life:
                      1. It "lighteth every man" (John 1:9).
                      2. It awakens the conscience (Heb. 4:12, 13).
                      3. It serves as judge (John 12:48).
                      4. It leads to faith (Rom. 10:17).
                      5. It begets new life (1 Peter 1:23; James 1:18).
                      6. It frees from the power of sin (John 8:31, 32).
                      7. It purifies the soul (1 Peter 1:22; John 15:3).
                      8. It sanctifies believer and church (John 17:17; Eph. 5:26).
                      9. It determines the Christian witness (Phil. 2:15, 16).
                     10. It leads to the Source of life eternal (John 5:24, 39).
                      "Our bodies are built up from what we eat and drink. And as in
                   the natural, so in the spiritual economy; it is that which our
                   minds dwell upon which sustains the spiritual nature.... [John
                   6:63 quoted]. Spiritual life must be sustained by communion
                   with Christ through His Word. The mind must dwell upon it, the
                   heart must be filled with it. The Word of God laid up in the heart
                   and sacredly cherished and obeyed, through the power of the
                    grace of Christ can make man right, and keep him right; but
                   every human influence, every earthly invention, is powerless to
                    give strength and wisdom to man. It cannot restrain passion, or
                    correct deformity of character. Unless the truth of God controls
                   the heart, the conscience will be warped."—Selected Mes-
                   sages, bk. 2, p. 125.

THINK IT THROUGH     Has the divine Communicator been able to form my charac-
                   ter after the likeness of Christ through the Written Word?
                     "Even greater is the power of the Bible in the development of
                   the spiritual nature. Man, created for fellowship with God, can
                   only in such fellowship find his real life and development.
                   Created to find in God his highest joy, he can find in nothing else
                   that which can quiet the cravings of the heart, can satisfy the
                   hunger and thirst of the soul. lie who with sincere and teachable
                   spirit studies God's word, seeking to comprehend its truths, will
                   be brought in touch with its Author; and, except by his own
                   choice, there is no limit to the possibilities of his develop-

                         "He saith unto me, These are the true sayings of God" (Rev.
                      19:9).
                          "He said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faith-
                      ful" (Rev. 21:5).
                          "He said unto me, These sayings are faithful and true" (Rev.
                      22:6).
                          "All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable
                      . . . for instruction in righteousness" (2 Tim. 3:16).

                         "It takes all of eternity to unfold the glories and bring out the
                      precious treasures of the Word of God. Do not let any living man
                      come to you and begin to dissect God's Word, telling what is
                      revelation, what is inspiration and what is not, without a rebuke.
                      Tell all such they simply do not know. They simply are not ableto
                      comprehend the things of the mystery of God. What we want is
                      to inspire faith. We want no one to say, 'This I will reject, and this
                      will I receive,' but we want to have implicit faith in the Bible as a
                      whole and as it is."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible

                      Revelation and, by extension, in all the Bible? Rev. 22:18,19.

                        "Such are the warnings which God has given to guard men
                      against changing in any manner that which He has revealed or
                      commanded. These solemn denunciations apply to all who by
                      their influence lead men to regard lightly the law of God.... The
                      written word, the law of God, will measure the character of every
                      man and condemn all whom this unerring test shall declare

THINK IT THROUGH        What are my purposes in searching the Scriptures? To find
                      something to uphold my opinions? To know what God says?

                        "Never attempt to search the Scriptures unless you are ready
                      to listen, unless you are ready to be a learner, unless you are
                      ready to listen to the Word of God as though His voice were
                      speaking directly to you from the living oracles. Never let mortal
                      man sit in judgment upon the Word of God or pass sentence as
                      to how much of this is inspired and how much is not inspired,
                      and that this is more inspired than some other portions. God

    THAT READS,
     HEARS, AND    "Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of
          KEEPS this prophecy, and keep those things which are written
                 therein" (Rev. 1:3).

                     The Revelation contains seven beatitudes (1:3; 14:13; 16:15;
                   19:9; 20:6; 22:7; 22:14). The first and the sixth are related to the
                   book itself. The first declares, "Blessed is he that readeth, and
                   they that hear ... , and keep"; and the sixth repeats, "Blessed is
                   he that keepeth" the words of this prophecy.
                     A benediction is pronounced upon those who pay due regard
                   to this communication. The blessing is promised to encourage
                   a study of this book. We are not to weary of it because of its
                   apparently mystical symbols. Christ can give us understanding.
                      "There should be a closer and more diligent study of the
                   Revelation, and a more earnest presentation of the truths it
                   contains—truths which concern all who are living in these last
                   days."—Evangelism, p. 197.

                     Who alone will finally receive a blessing? Rev. 22:7.

                      "He that keepeth" is the one for whom the revelation of God
                   had not been in vain. Jesus declares, "Blessed are they that hear
                   the word of God, and keep it" (Luke 11:28); and again, "My
                   mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God,
                   and do it" (Luke 8:21). He also points out in Matt. 7:24-27 the dif-
                   ference between those who merely hear and those who hear
                   and do the words of Jesus. This hearing and doing is the pa-
                   tience of the saints. (See Rev. 14:12.)

THINK IT THROUGH     What can a study of Revelation do for me?

                      "When we as a people understand what this book [Revela-
                   tion] means to us, there will be seen among us a great revival.
                   We do not understand fully the lessons that it teaches, not-
                   withstanding the injunction given us to search and study it....
                      "When the books of Daniel and Revelation are better under-
                   stood, believers will have an entirely different religious experi-
                   ence. They will be given such glimpses of the open gates of
                   heaven that heart and mind will be impressed with the character
                   that all must develop in order to realize the blessedness which is
                   to be the reward of the pure in heart."
                      "If our people were half awake, if they realized the nearness of
                   the events portrayed in the Revelation, a reformation would be
                   wrought in our churches, and many more would believe the

revealed that testimony to His servants
the prophets who, by "the Spirit of
Christ which was in them ... , testified
beforehand the sufferings of Christ,

(1 Peter 1:11).
   "God, who at sundry times and in
divers manners spake in time past
unto the fathers by the prophets, hath
in these last days spoken unto us by his

prophetic word when He came into
the world; He bore witness to the
truth and to His Father who sent Him.
(See John 5:36.)
   However, Jesus was unable to reveal
all that He wished during His earthly
ministry, even to His disciples. "I have
yet many things to say unto you, but ye

                       timony of Jesus Christ."
                         "I John ... was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word
                       of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ" (Rev. 1:2, 9).

                          Repeatedly in the book of Revelation it speaks of "the tes-
                       timony of Jesus Christ" (ch. 1:2, 9; 12:17), "the testimony of
                       Jesus" (ch. 19:10), or simply the "testimony" (ch. 6:9; 11:7;
                       12:11). "In the Greek this phrase [testimony of Jesus Christ] may
                       be understood either as the 'testimony' (or 'witness') Christians
                       bear concerning Jesus, or as the 'testimony' (or 'witness') that
                       originates with Jesus and is revealed to His church through the
                       prophets. . . . A comparison with ch. 19:10 clearly favors the
                       latter interpretation. There the 'testimony of Jesus' is defined as
                       the 'spirit of prophecy,' meaning that Jesus is witnessing to the
                       church through the medium of prophecy."—S.D.A. Bible
                       Commentary, vol. 7, p. 812.

                         What other expressions are associated with "the testimony
                       of Jesus"? Rev. 1:2, 9; 12:17.

                         The expression "testimony of Jesus" is associated with either
                       "the word of God" or "the commandments of God." The ex-
                       pression does not deal with the witness of the Scriptures, but of
                       Jesus Himself. The testimony of the Revelation is the fact that
                       Jesus is the "Word of God" (Rev. 19:13), so that, in reality, the
                       two are one and the same. This parallelism is also used in
                       Revelation 1:1, 2.

THINK IT THROUGH         How important to me is the testimony of Jesus revealed to
                       the prophet John on Patmos?

                           "We have been given a message exceeding in importance any
                       other message ever entrusted to mortals. This message Christ
                       came in person to the Isle of Patmos to present to John. He told
                       him to write down what he saw and heard during his vision, that
                       the churches might know what was to come upon the earth....
                           "The word, 'Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, be-
                       cause thou hast left thy first love,' is applicable to many living in
                       this time. God calls for immediate repentance and reformation.
                       It is time for a great change to take place among the people who
                       are looking for the second appearing of their Lord. Soon
                       strange things will take place. God will hold us responsible for
                       the way in which we treat the truth."—Medical Ministry, pp. 37,

                   testimony of Jesus Christ" (Rev. 1:9).

                      "In exiling John, the enemies of truth had hoped to silence
                   forever the voice of God's faithful witness; but on Patmos the
                   disciple received a message, the influence of which was to
                   continue to strengthen the church till the end of time. Though
                   not released from the responsibility of their wrong act, those
                   who banished John became instruments in the hands of God to
                   carry out Heaven's purpose; and the very effort to extinguish the

                   saw beneath the altar the company that were slain for the Word

                     "The enemy of righteousness left nothing undone in his effort
                   to stop the work committed to the Lord's builders.... Like the
                   apostles, many of them fell at their post, but the building of the
                   temple went steadily forward. The workmen were slain, but the
                   work advanced."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 598.

THINK IT THROUGH     What valuable lesson can I learn from the experience of
                   those Christians who have the "testimony of Jesus"?

                     "In the experience of the apostle John under persecution,
                   there is a lesson of wonderful strength and comfort for the
                   Christian. God does not prevent the plotting of wicked men, but
                   He causes their devices to work for good to those who in trial
                   and conflict maintain their faith and loyalty. Often the gospel
                   laborer carries on his work amid storms of persecution, bitter
                   opposition, and unjust reproach. At such times let him re-
                   member that the experience to be gained in the furnace of trial
                   and affliction is worth all the pain it costs. Thus God brings His
                   children near to Him, that He may show them their weakness
                   and His strength. He teaches them to lean on Him. Thus He
                   prepares them to meet emergencies, to fill positions of trust,
                   and to accomplish the great purpose for which their powers
                   were given them."—The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 574, 575.

        THE SPIRIT   timony of Jesus"?
     OF PROPHECY
                       "I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren that have the
                     testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is
                     the spirit of prophecy" (Rev. 19:10).
                       According to this scripture, the testimony of Jesus and the
                     spirit of prophecy are identical; in other words, all true prophets
                     have the testimony of Jesus, and all who have the testimony of
                     Jesus are prophets in the sense that they are mouthpieces or
                     witnesses for Jesus.
                       "The word 'prophecy' describes any inspired message com-
                     municated by God through a prophet. . . . Prophecy may be a
                     prediction of future events, though more commonly it is not.
                     The expression 'spirit of prophecy' refers specifically to the
                     'manifestation of the Spirit' in the form of a special gift of the
                     Holy Spirit that inspires the recipient and enables him to speak
                     authoritatively as a representative of God (1 Cor. 12:7-10) when
                     'moved by the Holy Ghost' to do so (2 Peter 1:21). The context of
                     the expression in Rev. 19:10 defines 'the testimony of Jesus'
                     and 'the spirit of prophecy' in this sense."—S.D.A. Bible Com-
                     mentary, vol. 7, p. 876.

                       What other detail proves that angels do Indeed confer the
                     testimony of Jesus to prophets? Rev. 19:10; 22:8, 9.
                        "The close relationship between the 'testimony of Jesus' and
                     prophecy is further demonstrated by a comparison between
                     chs. 19:10 and 22:9. In ch. 19:10 the angel identifies himself as
                     'thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of
                     Jesus,' and in ch. 22:9 as 'thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren
                     the prophets.' Thus, on the reasonable conclusion that these
                     two expressions of the angel are parallel, those who have the
                     testimony of Jesus are identified with the prophets. Since it is
                     the distinctive work of the prophets to bear messages from
                     Jesus to the people ... , the interpretation that the testimony of
                     Jesus refers to the 'testimony,' or 'witness,' that Jesus bears to
                     the church is strongly supported."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary,

THINK IT THROUGH       What attention do I give to the prophecies of Revelation?
                       "The solemn messages that have been given in their order in
                     the Revelation are to occupy the first place in the minds of God's

         Part 4    What can be assumed by the fact that the promise of the gift
     THE GIFT OF of prophecy was made to the church for the same reason as
      PROPHECY were the other gifts? Eph. 4:11-13; 1 Cor. 12:28.

                     "New Testament writers nowhere suggest that the gift of
                   prophecy was to end with the apostolic church. On the contrary,
                   Paul declares that, with the other gifts of the Spirit he lists in
                   Eph. 4:11, it was to continue 'till we all come in the unity of the
                   faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect
                   man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ' (v.
                   13). All of the other special gifts mentioned in v. 11 are still
                   needed in the church, and men and women are still qualified by
                   the Holy Spirit to fill these offices. Why should the office of
                   prophet be considered an exception?"—S.D.A. Bible Commen-
                   tary, vol. 7, p. 876.

                     What solemn warning did the apostles give? 1 Thess. 5:21;
                   1 John 4:1.

                     "Our Lord warned that the Christian church would be trou-
                   bled by false prophets, particularly as the time for His second
                   advent should draw near (Matt. 24:11, 24). The deceptive power
                   of these false prophets was to be so great that if it were possible
                   they would 'deceive the very elect.' The fact that Christ warned
                   against a false manifestation of the prophetic gift prior to His
                   second coming argues strongly that there would also be a
                   genuine manifestation of this gift, as otherwise He could simply
                   have warned against any and all prophets who might arise."—

THINK IT THROUGH     By what criteria am I able to judge the true prophet from the
                   false?

                     "The Scriptures specify certain standards by which those
                   who profess to speak for God are to be measured: (1) The
                   personal life of the prophet will be in harmony with the teach-
                   ings of Scripture (Matt. 7:15-20). (2) His messages will likewise
                   accord with Scripture. (3) His ministry will exalt Christ as the
                   Son of God and the Saviour of men (1 John 4:2). (4) His ministry
                   will be confirmed by fulfilled predictions (Jer. 28:9; cf. 1 Sam.
                   3:19). It is reasonable also to expect that the messages he bears
                   will be of practical benefit to the church, that they will be timely
                   and appropriate, that they will be free from human influence,
                   and that when he is in open vision his experience will be similar
                   to that of the Bible prophets."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol.

                        "The commandments of God and the testimony of Jesus are

                     truth and error is but the final struggle of the long-standing
                     controversy concerning the law of God."—The Great Con-
                     troversy, p. 582. (2) Jesus wished to entrust a special testimony
                     to the remnant church, the church charged with the responsibil-
                     ity of proclaiming His last message to the world. "Seventh-day
                     Adventists ... believe that the 'remnant' will be distinguished by
                     the manifestation of the gift of prophecy in their midst. The
                     'testimony of Jesus Christ,' they believe, is the witness of Jesus
                     in their midst through the medium of the prophetic gift."—
                     S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 812.
                        How can we justify our claim that the Seventh-day Adventist
                     Church is the church of the remnant? In Hebrew the word
                     translated "remnant" means "those who escape," "what re-
                     mains," or "what is left." Those who escaped from Assyrian
                     captivity are called a "remnant." (See 2 Chron. 30:6.) The same
                     word is applied to those who escape from mystical Babylon.
                        How is the spirit of prophecy evident in the Adventist Church?
                     Seventh-day Adventists have ground to believe that the gift of
                     prophecy was evidenced in the ministry and writings of Ellen
                     White. She was active as God's messenger among us from 1844
                     to 1915. However, we do not consider her writings to be a
                     substitute for or an addition to the Bible. They are simply, she
                     explained, "a lesser light to lead men and women to the greater
                     light."—Colporteur Ministry, p. 125. These writings do not pre-
                     sent a new path to salvation; rather they lead to a better under-
                     standing of the plan of salvation revealed in the Bible.

THINK IT THROUGH       Do I have complete confidence in the testimony of Jesus
                     given to our church through the messages of Ellen White?

                       "The very last deception of Satan will be to make of none

                                                                         April 11

          Part 6     To whom was the prophet instructed to make known the
       WRITE TO    testimony of Jesus?
      THE SEVEN
      CHURCHES       "What thou seest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven
                   churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna,
                   and unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and
                   unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea" (Rev. 1:11).

                      John was told several times to put into writing all that he had
                   seen, all the things which must shortly come to pass, and that
                   which the Lord had sent His angel to make known unto him. He
                   was instructed to send the book to the seven churches.
                      "The names of the seven churches are symbolic of the church
                   in different periods of the Christian Era. The number 7 indicates
                   completeness, and is symbolic of the fact that the messages
                   extend to the end of time, while the symbols used reveal the
                   condition of the church at different periods in the history of the
                   world."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 585.
                      What is the essential content of the testimony of Jesus to the
                   seven churches? The Revelation is, first of all, a revelation of
                   Jesus Christ (ch. 1:1). No longer as the suffering Messiah, but as
                   the risen Lord, who is "alive for evermore" (ch. 1:18), now He
                   works for His church at the right hand of the throne of God (ch.
                   5:7) in the heavenly sanctuary (ch. 11:19; 15:5), until the day
                   when He will return in the clouds of heaven (ch. 1:7; 19:11-16).
                      Second, the Revelation is a disclosure of "things which must
                   shortly come to pass" (ch. 1:1), information which Christ
                   wished to reveal to His church. This is why He addressed a
                   special message to each of the seven symbolic churches. Be-
                   sides local and historical application, each of the messages has
                   spiritual value for all the other churches, and thus for today.
                      Finally, the Revelation contains a special testimony for the
                   remnant church, the one entrusted with the mission of preach-
                    ing "the everlasting gospel" (ch. 14:6). That too will be the
                   subject of our study, for we know that on the understanding of it
                   depend, not only the faith of the Adventist community, but also
                   the success of its mission in the world.

THINK IT THROUGH     How do I picture Jesus?

                      Our picture of a risen Christ, victorious over death, and "alive
                   for evermore," depends essentially on the visions recorded in
                   the book of Revelation. Through the study of the Revelation,
                   Seventh-day Adventists rediscovered the all-powerful, living
                   Jesus described by John, along with the unique truth of Christ's
                   working for His people in the heavenly sanctuary. This is the way
                   He chose to reveal Himself in each of the visions in the Revela-
                   tion.

                     John was instructed to write to the angel of each of the seven
                   churches. In the original this can designate a human messenger
                   as well as a celestial being. Here it refers to the one to whom
                   God has entrusted weighty responsibilities in His church. (See
                   The Acts of the Apostles, p. 586.)

                     What is the meaning of the symbols under which Jesus
                   presents Himself to the church in Ephesus? Rev. 2:1; 1:20.

                     "Christ is represented as holding the seven stars in His right
                   hand. This assures us that no church faithful to its trust need

                     What relation is there between the symbol of the candle-
                   sticks and the warning that Jesus addresses to the church in
                   Ephesus? Rev. 2:5.

                       "In the message to the church at Ephesus, Christ is rep-
                   resented as holding the seven stars in His hand, and walking in
                   the midst of the seven golden candlesticks. He is represented as
                   'walking' among them, thus illustrating His constant diligence
                   in behalf of His church. . . . These figures are to be carefully

     "THOU HAST Ephesus?
        LEFT THY

                  how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast
                  tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast
                  found them liars: and hast borne, and hast patience, and for
                  my name's sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted."
                     "Thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitanes, which I also
                  hate" (Rev. 2:2, 3, 6).
                     "To each of the seven churches Christ declares, 'I know thy
                   works.' His admonition is that of One who is fully acquainted
                   with problems of each church and who is therefore able to
                   recommend an appropriate and effective solution."—S.D.A.
                   Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 743.
                     The commendation made to the church at Ephesus rested
                   upon its works, its labor and endurance, the deeds which ex-
                   hibited its character. The Ephesian church did not tolerate
                   evildoers and false brethren any more than it did false
                   shepherds and false apostles. Moreover, the church did not
                   become weary in its afflictions for Christ. In verse 6 special
                   mention is made of its attitude toward the Nicolaitanes, mem-
                   bers of a heretical sect whose works displeased God.

                     What reproof is directed to the church in Ephesus? Rev. 2:4.
                     "At the first the experience of the church at Ephesus was
                   marked with childlike simplicity and fervor... .
                      "But after a time the zeal of the believers began to wane, and
                   their love for God and for one another grew less. Coldness crept
                   into the church. Some forgot the wonderful manner in which
                   they had received the truth."—The Acts of the Apostles, pp.
                   578-580.

THINK IT THROUGH     How does the experience of the Ephesians concern me?
                     "I am instructed to say that these words [Rev. 2:4, 5] are
                   applicable to Seventh-day Adventist churches in their present
                   condition. The love of God has been lost, and this means the
                   absence of love for one another.... Great light has been given to
                   her. She has had abundant opportunity for bearing much fruit.
                   But selfishness has come in, and God says, 'I will remove thy

                   White, Review and Herald, Feb. 25, 1902.
                     An important lesson from the experience of the Ephesian
                   community is that love cannot be replaced by other virtues. The
                   lack of love renders the other virtues hollow and empty. (See

                         Spiritual decline has only one cure—the one recommended
                       by Jesus. It bears the three characteristics of genuine conver-
                       sion: an awakening of conscience, repentance, and works of
                       faith. A call to repentance is sounded in all of the messages to

                         What did the Witness say would happen if the believers did
                       not repent? Verse 5.

                         The Lord is always ready to act on behalf of His children, be it
                       to strengthen or to comfort them. If they do not turn from Him,
                       He will continue to work, to lead them to repentance. However,
                       divine warnings will not continue if they go unheeded. Unless
                       there is repentance, the Lord will remove their candlestick out
                       of its place and bestow on others the responsibility of lighting
                       the world, which is the high mission of the church. (See Matt.
                       21:41.)
                         The apostolic church was essentially of Jewish origin. After
                       the death of the apostles and the destruction of Jerusalem a
                       change took place. This warning could well have been realized
                       by the transfer of the candlestick from the Judeo-Christian
                       church, represented by the church at Ephesus, to a Christian
                       church of pagan background, represented by that of Smyrna.

THINK IT THROUGH         Of what do I personally need to repent?

                         "Has the candlestick been removed out of its place? I call
                       upon all who are resting unconcerned in their present state of
                       spiritual deadness, to arouse and arise from the dead, and
                       Christ will give them light. Many rest as content as though the
                       cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night were sheltering and
                       guiding them. Many profess to know God, and yet deny Him in
                       their works. They reckon themselves among God's peculiar,
                       chosen people, who have a special, solemn message entrusted
                       to their keeping to sanctify their lives and to give to the world,
                       and yet the power of the truth is scarcely felt or manifested in
                       our midst in zealous work for God. How great is our darkness,
                       and we know it not! The light has not diminished, but we walk
                       not in its rays."—Testimonies to Ministers, p. 451.

The Churches of the Catacombs                LESSON 3               ❑ Wednesday
                                                                        April 16
          Part 4      What call was made to each of the seven churches?
   "TO HIM THAT
   OVERCOMETH"        "He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto
                    the churches" (Rev. 2:7).

                        This call is repeated at the close of each of the letters to the
                   . seven churches, either to introduce a promise (Rev. 2:7, 11, 17)
                     or to conclude the message (ch. 2:29; 3:6, 13, 22). Here the Spirit
                     addresses "the churches," because God's promises are for the
                     believers of every age.
                        The first condition for gaining eternal life is to know how to
                     listen. On several occasionsJesus emphasized this in His teach-
                     ings. (See Matt. 11:15; 13:9, 43; Luke 14:35.) In the Scriptures, to
                     listen means not only to hear but also to understand and put into
                     practice. (See 1 Sam. 15:22; Matt. 7:24-27; Luke 8:21; Rev. 1:3.)

                      To whom is the promise in f he first letter made? Where will it
                    be fulfilled? Rev. 2:7.

                      In all seven letters the promise is for those who overcome.
                    Revelation 2:7 never specifies what victory is in question, but all
                    who are born of God know that it is the "victery that overcometh
                    the world" (1 John 5:4). Jesus defined it clearly when He said,
                    "Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into
                    the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father
                    which is in heaven" (Matt. 7:21). For the Ephesian Christians,
                    the needed victory is a return to their first love. The fulfillment of
                    this promise will be perfectly realized in the kingdom of God.
                      It is interesting to note that some of the promises made to the
                    churches are details from the description given in Revelation 21
                    and 22 of the "new heaven and new earth." (See Rev. 22:2, 4.)

THINK IT THROUGH      What are the traits of character over which I need to gain the
                    victory?

                      "I saw that none could share the 'refreshing' unless they
                    obtain the victory over every besetment, over pride, selfishness,
                    love of the world, and over every wrong word and action."—
                    Early Writings, p. 71.
                      "When He [Jesus] comes, He is not to cleanse us of our sins,
                    to remove from us the defects in our characters, or to cure us of
                    the infirmities of our tempers and dispositions. If wrought for us
                    at all, this work will be accomplished before that time."—

                      "These things saith the first and the last, which was dead,
                    and is alive" (Rev. 2:8).

                      The manner in which the Saviour presents Himself to each of
                    the seven churches is always related to the needs of that
                    church. To the church persecuted by imperial Rome, Christ
                    reveals Himself as the timeless, all-powerful One in heaven and
                    on earth, the One who suffered and died and who lives again.

                      What is the condition of the Smyrna church? Verse 9.

                       The tribulations of the church in Smyrna issued from three
                    sources: persecution, abject poverty, and slander. For more
                    than two centuries the Christian church had to face a period of
                    the most bitter persecution. Although the church of Smyrna was
                    stripped of all worldly possessions, the spiritual riches which it
                    possessed amply compensated for the condition of material
                    poverty. Thus the church in Smyrna enriched the world more
                    than any other church (compare 2 Cor. 6:10); the testimony of
                    her martyrs constituted gospel seed.
                       For the church of this era the cruelest trial resulted from the
                    blasphemy of the Jews. The book of Acts records that the ear-
                    liest persecution could be traced to the synagogues. (See Acts
                    13:45; 14:2, 19; 17:5, 13; 18:5, 6, 12.) During the second century
                    the Jews accused the Christians of having falsified the Scrip-
                    tures, which was the worst possible accusation. From then on,
                    becoming enemies of the Christian church, the blasphemers
                    were no longer true Jews. They lined up on the side of him who
                    accuses the children of God, and thus they formed the
                    "synagogue of Satan." (See Zech. 3:1; Rev. 12:10.)

THINK IT THROUGH      Would I be able to withstand slander for the sake of the
                    gospel?

                       "Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute
                    you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my
                    sake" (Matt. 5:11).
                       "I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you,
                    do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despite-
                    fully use you, and persecute you; that ye may be the children of
                    your Father which is in heaven" (Matt. 5:44, 45).
                       "Being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it: being
                    defamed, we intreat" (1 Cor. 4:12, 13).

     THE CROWN Christians?
        OF LIFE
                  "Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer ... ye
                shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death,
                and I will give thee a crown of life" (Rev. 2:10).

                      This exhortation is without reproof or threat, and also without
                   hiding the sufferings awaiting the Smyrna church. The devil
                   (literally "slanderer"), clearly pointed out as the instigator of the
                   persecution, wants only to make the believer fall. God permits
                   suffering to try one's faith (James 1:2-4; 1 Peter 1:6-9; Rom. 5:3,
                   4), but God's church is not to fear, Although some of its number
                   must endure persecution, in this they are privileged to partici-
                   pate in the sufferings of Christ for the edification of the church.
                   (See Col. 1:24.)
                      The tribulation of ten days foretold here corresponds to the
                   ten years of bitter persecution (A.D. 303-313) unleashed by
                   Diocletian to exterminate the Christian church. But the fidelity
                   of Christ's witnesses assured the triumph, not the extermina-
                   tion, of the gospel. After more than two centuries of tribulation
                   at the hands of successive Roman emperors, Constantine was
                   obliged to sign the Edict of Milan in 313, establishing the
                   triumph of Christianity.

                     What promise is made to the overcomer? Rev. 2:11.

                      In verse 10 the Saviour promises a "crown of life" to him who
                   is "faithful unto death." In verse 11 He assures the overcomer
                   that he will not suffer the "second death," which is the final
                   destruction "in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone"
                   (Rev. 21:8). (See Rev. 20:6, 14.)
                      "Choose poverty, reproach, separation from friends, or any
                   suffering rather than to defile the soul with sin. Death before
                   dishonor or the transgression of God's law should be the motto
                   of every Christian."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 147.

THINK IT THROUGH     How shall I prepare to suffer for the triumph of God's cause?

                     "We must share the conflicts if we wear the crown of victory.
                   Like Jesus, we must be made perfect through suffering. Had
                   Christ's life been one of ease, then might we safely yield to sloth.
                   Since His life was marked with continual self-denial, suffering,
                   and self-sacrifice, we shall make no complaint if we are partak-
                   ers with Him. We can walk safely in the darkest path if we have

     THE APOSTATE
          CHURCH     "To the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things
                   saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges" (Rev.
                   2:12). (Compare Heb. 4:12.)

                       This distinctive characteristic of Jesus has already been men-
                    tioned in Revelation 1:16, and it will be found again in Revela-
                    tion 19:15. Jesus is the Living Word, the standard of all truth. In a
                    time of compromise, apostasy, and rising popularity of Chris-
                    tianity, the Saviour presents Himself to His church as the One
                    possessing the "sword of the Spirit," ready to contend with all
                    that is not in harmony with truth. (See Eph. 6:10, 17.)

                      For what did Jesus commend the church in Pergamos?
                    Verse 13.

                       The principal virtue of the church in Pergamos was that she
                    was able to hold fast in an unfavorable environment, a veritable
                    citadel of paganism, even "where Satan sits enthroned" (Mof-

                    emperor was established in 29 B.C. At the very time that John
                    was writing these messages Christians were being persecuted
                    for refusing to worship the emperor Domitian (A.D. 81-96), who
                    insisted that people worship him as "lord and god."
                       The Pergamos church aptly symbolizes the period of church
                    history when the adversary established himself through deceit-
                    ful means in the very "temple of God," as the apostle Paul in
                    2 Thessalonians 2:3-12 had foretold would happen.

THINK IT THROUGH      Why is there no widespread persecution in our day?

                       "The only reason [that persecution seems to slumber] is that
                    the church has conformed to the world's standard and there-
                    fore awakens no opposition. The religion which is current in our
                    day is not of the pure and holy character that marked the Chris-
                    tian faith in the days of Christ and His apostles. It is only because
                    of the spirit of compromise with sin, because the great truths of
                    the word of God are so indifferently regarded, because there is
                    so little vital godliness in the church, that Christianity is appar-
                    ently so popular with the world. Let there be a revival of the
                    faith and power of the early church, and the spirit of persecution
                    will be revived, and the fires of persecution will be rekin-
                    dled."—The Great Controversy, p. 48.

                                                                            April 21
           Part 2   What double rebuke does Jesus address to the church in
       WORLDLY Pergamos?
     INFLUENCES
     CONDEMNED      "I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there
                  them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to
                  cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat
                  things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication. So hast
                  thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitanes,
                  which thing I hate" (Rev. 2:14, 15).

                      The church is not accused of believing the condemned doc-
                   trines, but of tolerating "them that hold the doctrine of Balaam"
                   in their midst and also "them that hold the doctrine of the
                   Nicolaitanes." The problem of the church in Pergamos lay in
                   allowing the true and the false to live together. The introduction
                   of the pagan masses into the church, after Christianity was
                   recognized as the state religion, led to spiritual idolatry and
                   worldly license. What Satan was unable to accomplish through
                   persecution, he achieved by seduction, encouraging practices
                   that advanced selfish interests, not those of God's people, as
                   Balaam had in the time of ancient Israel.
                      The doctrine of the Nicolaitanes was one that God hated, one
                   that He commended the Ephesus church for rejecting. (See Rev.
                   2:6.) For the Christian church to tolerate it was proof of its apos-
                   tasy at the very moment of triumph (A.D. 313-538).

                     What does the Lord's threat of intervention signify? Verse
                   16.

                     Again our Lord sounds a call to repentance. Jesus is not
                   calling those who are in sin and error, but those who tolerate
                   error while carrying His name. Jesus assures that He Himself
                   will intervene to combat the heresy. The threat, "I . . will fight
                   against them with the sword of my mouth," typifies the punish-
                   ment meted out at the judgment. (See Rev. 19:15, 21.)

THINK IT THROUGH    What worldly ways are in my life that are condemned by
                   God's Word?

                     "As the truth is brought into practical life, the standard is to be
                   elevated higher and higher, to meet the requirements of the
                   Bible. This will necessitate opposition to the fashions, customs,
                   practices, and maxims of the world. Worldly influences, like the
                   waves of the sea, beat against the followers of Christ to sweep
                   them away from the true principles of the meekness and grace
                   of Christ; but they are to stand as firm as a rock to principle. It
                   will require moral courage to do this, and those whose souls are
                   not riveted to the eternal Rock, will be swept away by the worldly
                   current."—Fundamentals of Christian Education, pp. 288, 289.

The Churches of the Cathedrals            LESSON 4                   ❑ Tuesday
                                                                       April 22
         Part 3    What triple promise is made to the overcomer?
      PROMISES
        TO THE     "To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden
     OVERCOMER manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new
                name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth
                it" (Rev. 2:17).

                      "A white stone," according to some, recalls the stone given to
                   the winning gladiator; according to others, it is the stone used
                   by jurors to signify acquittal; or, according to still others, the
                   stone given as a ticket to enter the theater. Whatever signifi-
                   cance is alluded to, it is recognized as a well-known ceremony
                   of ancient times honoring the receiver.
                      "A new name" signifies a new character. In Bible times a
                   name was given that described the character of the receiver.
                   Here a new name is promised the overcomer—a name that
                   describes the new character of the overcomer, one that per-
                   fectly reflects his personal, intimate experience with Jesus. That
                   is why "no man knoweth [it] saving he that receiveth it." This
                   new name, written in the white stone, will serve as a sign
                   evidencing victory, or acquittal of all guilt of sin, or perhaps
                   serve as a ticket to enter the kingdom of heaven.

                     How can the Word be both a sword and manna at the same
                   time? Rev. 2:12, 17.

                     In the Christian's armor "the sword of the Spirit, which is the
                   word of God" (Eph 6:17), is the only offensive weapon. It is the
                   one used by Jesus to triumph over the tempter, and the one that
                   He is ready to use in the church against all who are not in
                   harmony with holy doctrine. But the Word of God is also daily
                   bread for the believer; it is the manna from heaven that
                   nourishes every man who wishes to do the will of God. (See
                   Matt. 4:4; John 4:34.) Just as Jesus is the sharp, two-edged
                   sword, so He is also "the living bread which came down from
                   heaven." He counsels, "If any man eat of this bread, he shall live
                   for ever" (John 6:51).

THINK IT THROUGH     What is my character like? Am I fitted to enter the kingdom?

                     "Each one will have a close struggle to overcome sin in his
                   own heart. This is at times a very painful and discouraging work;
                   because, as we see the deformities in our character, we keep
                   looking at them, when we should look to Jesus and put on the
                   robe of His righteousness. Everyone who enters the pearly
                   gates of the city of God will enter there as a conqueror, and his
                   greatest conquest will have been the conquest of self."—

The Churches of the Cathedrals            LESSON 4               ❑ Wednesday
                                                                     April 23
          Part 4     What title does Jesus use to present Himself to the church in
    MESSAGE TO     Thyatira? What attributes are inherent in that title?
    THE CHURCH
         OF THE       "Unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things
    MIDDLE AGES    saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of
                   fire, and his feet are like fine brass" (Rev. 2:18).

                     This is the only time in the book of Revelation that Jesus uses
                   the title "Son of God" with the definite article. Thus He specifi-
                   cally identifies Himself as a member of the Godhead and lays
                   claim to the divine attributes of omniscience and omnipotence.
                   He is the One who sees all, penetrates all, examines all; the One
                   to whom ''all power is given ... in heaven and in earth" (Matt.
                   28:18).

                    What Christian virtues did Jesus extol in His words of com-
                   mendation to the Thyatira church? Verse 19.

                     The Saviour never judges by appearances. He is able to detect
                   good, to see whatever is worthy of commendation, even in the
                   darkness of the Middle Ages. In truth, the heart is never com-
                   pletely devoid of spirituality when one devotes himself to the
                   dissemination of faith among the faithless. For ages works of
                   charity were numerous and flourishing. Genuine Christians
                   dedicated themselves to the binding up of Europe's wounds in
                   the wake of wars, invasions, and calamities. Contrary to the
                   experience at Ephesus, the church in Thyatira experienced
                   spiritual progress. She was the only' one of the seven where,
                   despite serious weaknesses, there was growth. "I know thy
                   works, . . . and the last to be more than the first" (verse 19).

THINK IT THROUGH     What is a fair judgment of Thyatira Christians?

                      "Millions went down to the grave loaded with infamy because
                   they steadfastly refused to yield to the deceptive claims of Sa-
                   tan. By human tribunals they were adjudged the vilest of
                   criminals."—The Great Controversy, p. 650.
                      in passing judgment one must distinguish between Catholi-
                   cism as a religion and the Catholic believer. "It is true that there
                   are real Christians in the Roman Catholic communion.
                   Thousands in that church are serving God according to the best
                   light they have. . . . God looks with pitying tenderness upon
                   these souls, educated as they are in a faith that is delusive and
                   unsatisfying. He will cause rays of light to penetrate the dense
                   darkness that surrounds them. He will reveal to them the truth
                   as it is in Jesus, and many will yet take their position with His
                   people."—The Great Controversy, p. 565.

             Part 5      What serious reprimand is directed to the church in Thya-
       JEZEBEL, THE   tira? Rev. 2:20, 21.
       PROPHETESS
                        The name "Jezebel" recalls the worst moment of Israel's
                      history.
                        When Jezebel became queen, she introduced the worship of
                      Baal in Israel, and established over 400 priests of Baal. She did
                      not hesitate to use temporal power to force her pagan customs
                      upon the people. As in Jezebel's day when Israel suffered three
                      and a half years of famine before there was a reform, so many
                      other details of Israel's history are symbolic of the history of the
                      Christian church in the Middle Ages.
                        The Lord gave the church opportunity to repent. Throughout
                      the centuries He raised up reformers—Wycliffe, Savonarola,
                      Huss and Jerome, Luther, and others—"but," He exclaimed,
                      "she refuses to repent of her immorality" (Rev. 2:21, RSV).

                       What serious judgments were pronounced against those
                      who accepted Jezebel? Verses 22, 23.

                         A bed of pain would replace her bed of impurity. Great tribula-
                      tion would strike those "that commit adultery with her." God
                      would "kill . . . with death," probably by pestilence or by the
                      second death, the children of her prostitution. The Lord vowed
                      to render to each one according to his works.

                        What counsel is given to all others in Thyatira? Verses 24,
                      25.

                        As in the time of Jezebel, when the Lord had 7000 in Israel
                      whose knees had not bowed to Baal (1 Kings 19:18), so through
                      the ages of the Thyatira period there were those who did not
                      accept the doctrine of Jezebel,—the Vaudois, the Albigenses,
                      the Hussites, the Huguenots, the Moravian Brothers, etc. To
                      them, "the rest in Thyatira," the Lord promised not to put upon
                      them any other burden. "But," He admonished, "that which ye
                      have already hold fast till I come" (verse 25).

THINK IT THROUGH        Everyone will be held responsible according to the light that
                      he has received.

                        "Our fathers are not accountable for the light they never
                      received, or for the messages of warning they never heard....
                        "Special truths have been adapted to the conditions of the
                      nations as they have existed. The present truth, which is a test to
                      the people of this generation, was not a test to the people of
                      generations far back. . . .
                        "We are accountable only for the light that shines upon

The Churches of the Cathedrals            LESSON 4                      ❑   Friday
                                                                           April 25
          Part 6     What promise is made to the overcomer in Thyatira?
 PROMISE OF THE
  MORNING STAR       "He that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end,
                   to him will I give power over the nations: and he shall rule them
                   with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be
                   broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father" (Rev. 2:26,
                   27).

                     The words of this promise are borrowed from Psalm 2, and
                   some of the details are repeated by the apostle John later in this
                   book (ch. 12:5; 19:15). The promise to the elect is that they shall
                   reign with Christ and have authority over the nations. (See Rev.
                   20:6.) To this end the Master Potter will break in pieces the old
                   order, all the wicked nations, and make all things new; and the
                   power and dominion will be given Him by His Father.

                     What is the significance of the words "morning star" con-
                   tained in the climax of this promise? Verse 28.

                      This symbol, probably a reference to Balaam's promise to
                   Israel (Num. 24:17) announcing the coming of the Messiah, was
                   also used by Peter in alluding to the believer's experience with
                   the Saviour (2 Peter 1:19). To the overcomer will be given the

                   the "bright and morning star" (Rev. 22:16).
                      The morning star, a sign of day, of soon-coming greater light
                   to disperse the night, was a fit promise to the church of the
                   Middle Ages.

                     Why does the call to listen come at the close of this mes-
                   sage? Verse 29.

                     In the three preceding letters this admonition called the
                   hearer's attention to the promise which followed. Beginning
                   with the letter to the Thyatira church the call comes at the close
                   of the message to emphasize how important it is for the listener
                   to hear and understand the entire message, "what the Spirit
                   saith unto the churches" in its entirety.

                     The message to the church at Thyatira invites us to hold fast
                   that which we have (verse 25); to persevere in works that reflect
                   Christ until the very end (verse 26); and to act in such a way that

(1517) to the present era (1844).
   Situated some 48 kilometers (30
miles) southeast of Thyatira, the city of
Sardis was the capital of the kingdom
of Lydia. It reached its zenith of wealth
and power under Croesus during the
sixth century B.C. Built on a plateau of
crumbling rock, some 457 meters
(1500 feet) above sea level, Sardis was
considered impregnable except at one
point. It was there that Cyrus made his
surprise attack, like a thief in the night,
and during the second century B.C.
the city was again captured in the same
way, which explains the admonition
"be watchful" in verse 2.
   The churches of Sardis and
Philadelphia are mentioned only in the
book of Revelation, although their
origins must certainly date back to the
time of the apostle Paul. The first
represents the church of the
Reformation, 1517 to 1798, and the

"brotherly love," admirably

            Part 1     What is the significance of the two symbols used by Jesus to
      THE CHURCH     identify Himself in His epistle to the Sardis church?
           OF THE
     REFORMATION       "Unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things
                     saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven
                     stars" (Rev. 3:1).

                       Here our Lord presents Himself as the One that has the seven
                     Spirits of God, or the Spirit in His fullness and completeness
                     (Rev. 1:4), and, at the same time, control of His church, since the
                     seven stars are in His right hand. (See Rev. 1:16, 17.)

                        What is the true condition of the church in Sardis? Rev. 3:
                     1, 2.

                         Although the church in Sardis has the reputation of being
                     alive, the Lord is not deceived; He does not mistake vigorous
                     activity for life. Jesus states plainly, "Thou ... art dead." What
                     the Sardis members need is to come alive in Christ by being
                     filled with His Spirit, without which vital godliness is impossible;
                     and then they will obtain spiritual accountability to maintain
                     and nourish this new life. Jesus comes to Sardis with the seven
                     Spirits of God and the seven stars to meet this need.
                         In truth Sardis represents the sad plight of modern-day Prot-
                     estantism. In its beginning the Reformation church rediscov-
                     ered what it means to live by faith in Jesus Christ, but, satisfied
                     with certain attainments, the church grew indifferent. Today,
                     ignorant of the great truths upon which it was founded, Protes-
                     tantism has only a pretense of life; and, barring vigilance and
                     special care, "the things which remain . . . are ready to die."

                       What judgment is pronounced upon the works of the Sardis
                     church? Verse 2.

                       The works of Sardis were not perfect. This also means that the
                     members were incomplete, unfulfilled. By a return to the Bible
                     the Reformation church found truth, but this work was not
                     completed. It did not come to perfection.

THINK IT THROUGH       What can I do to maintain my spiritual life?

                       "Yes, there are many such [persons who neglect Bible study]
                     among us as a people, many who claim to be alive, while they
                     are dead. My brethren, unless the Holy Spirit is actuating you as
                     a vital principle, unless you are obeying its prompting, depend-

           Part 2     What is the fivefold counsel given to the church in Sardis?
     BE WATCHFUL
                      "Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that
                    are ready to die. . . . Remember therefore how thou hast
                    received and heard, and hold fast, and repent" (Rev. 3:2, 3).

                      Historically, overconfidence and carelessness resulted in the
                    capture of Sardis by the enemy. It was also a lack of vigilance
                    that caused the spiritual death of the Sardis church. But the
                    condition is not without remedy. Jesus, who possesses the
                    Spirit in all His fullness, is able to revive spiritually. The remedy,
                    a full return to the gospel, is clearly indicated.
                      To possess the truth it is not sufficient to have received it in a
                    providential way or to have heard it with fervor; one must be
                    vigilant and persevere in keeping it. If spirituality has degener-
                    ated into a state of lifeless formalism, only repentance can heal
                    the condition.
                      "'And repent.' The life we live is to be one of continual
                    repentance and humility. We need to repent constantly, that we
                    may be constantly victorious. When we have true humility, we
                    have victory."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Com-
                    mentary, vol. 7, p. 959.

                     What will be the result to the church if Sardis does not
                    watch? Verse 3.

                       Here we have a reference to the return of Jesus. (Compare
                    Matt. 24:43; Luke 12:39; 1 Thess. 5:2; 2 Peter 3:10; Rev. 16:15.)
                    This allusion establishes this church chronologically. Sardis is
                    the church that should have recognized the signs announcing
                    the return of Jesus to earth—the Lisbon earthquake, 1755, and
                    the dark day, May 19, 1780—but because it was not watching,
                    the Lord would come, for it, as a thief in the night, at an hour that
                    it knew not. Today many nominal Christians are not only ignor-
                    ant of the signs pointing to the return of Jesus, but also purely
                    and simply deny His return.

THINK IT THROUGH      As an alert Christian, am I conscious that spiritual ramparts
                    require constant vigilance?

                      "Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be ac-
                    counted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to
                    pass, and to stand before the Son of man" (Luke 21:36).

              Part 3      Whom does the Lord commend in the church in Sardis?
       A THREEFOLD
           PROMISE       "Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not
                       defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white:
                       for they are worthy" (Rev. 3:4).

                         "The church of Sardis is represented as having in it a few
                       faithful ones among the many who had become, as it were,
                       careless and insensible of their obligations to God.... Who is so
                       favored as to be numbered among these few in Sardis? Are
                       you? Am I? Who are among this number? Is it not best for us to
                       inquire into this matter, in order that we may learn to whom the
                       Lord refers when He says that a few have not stained their white
                       robes of character?"—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible
                       Commentary, vol. 7, p. 959.

                         What threefold promise is made to the overcomer in Sardis?
                       Verse 5.

                           In this threefold promise the conditions of salvation are
                       clearly stated as follows:
                           1.One must be clothed in white raiment, which is the symbol
                       of the righteousness of Christ received by faith, or justification
                       by faith.
                           2. One's name must be written in the book of life, figurative of
                       salvation by grace. This does not depend on an arbitrary act on
                       the part of God, but on our faith in Jesus and our obedience to
                       His law—"faith which worketh by love" (Gal. 5:6), or "obedi-
                       ence to the faith" (Rom. 1:5).
                           3. One must receive Christ's approval. It is He who confesses
                       (literally, confirms) our names before His Father in His work of
                       intercession.

THINK IT THROUGH          Examples to follow: "Because of their faith this honor [to
                       walk with Jesus in white] is bestowed on them [the faithful few].
                       In this life they did not boast, nor lift up their souls unto vanity.
                       With intensity of desire, with a pure, holy faith, they grasped the
                       promise of eternal riches. Their one desire was to be like Christ.
                       Ever they kept the standard of righteousness uplifted. To them
                       is given an eternal weight of glory, because on the earth they
                       walked with God, keeping themselves unspotted from the
                       world, revealing to their fellow beings the righteousness of

         Part 4   What is the significance of the qualifications under which
       CHURCH the Lord announces Himself to the church of Philadelphia?
        OF THE
     AWAKENING    "These things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that
                hath the key of David, he that openeth, and no man shutteth;
                and shutteth, and no man openeth" (Rev. 3:7).

                     Once again Jesus presents Himself with the attributes of the
                   Divinity. He is "the Holy One" (Acts 3:14)—that is, He who was
                   preeminently set apart to accomplish the will of God. Because
                   He perfectly accomplished His mission, He possesses the key of
                   David and the power to open or to close the door of the kingdom
                   of which the throne of David was the type, the kingdom of the
                   children of God.
                     This verse has special historical significance for Seventh-day
                   Adventists. "I saw that Jesus had shut the door of the holy place,
                   and no man can open it; and that He had opened the door into
                   the most holy, and no man can shut it (Rev. 3:7, 8); and that
                   since Jesus has opened the door into the most holy place, which
                   contains the ark, the commandments have been shining out to
                   God's people."—Early Writings, p. 42.

                     What qualities embody the worth of the church of Philadel-
                   phia? Verse 8.

                     Christ addresses neither a reproach nor a warning to the
                   church of Philadelphia. The Lord simply points out the result of
                   an exceptional religious situation. All is possible for God when
                   His children do not depend on their own power (2 Cor. 1:9, 10),
                   when they keep His word, and when they are not ashamed of the
                   testimony of Jesus.

THINK IT THROUGH     "The true Witness has given us the assurance that He has set
                   before us an open door, which no man can shut. Those who are
                   seeking to be faithful to God may be denied many of the
                   privileges of the world; their way may be hedged up and their
                   work hindered by the enemies of truth; but there is no power
                   that can close the door of communication between God and
                   their souls. The Christian himself may close this door by in-
                   dulgence in sin, or by rejection of heaven's light. He may turn
                   away his ears from hearing the message of truth, and in this way
                   sever the connection between God and his soul.... Neither man
                   nor Satan can close the door which Christ has opened for
                   us."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol.

           Part 5      What triple promise is made to the church of Philadelphia as
     "THOU HAST      the result of its exceptional spiritual experience? Rev. 3:8-10.
 KEPT THE WORD"
                        1. "Behold, I have set before thee an open door" (verse 8).
                     This is a promise of unlimited opportunity for missionary en-
                     deavor that no worldly power can hinder. (See Acts 14:27; 1 Cor.
                     16:8, 9; 2 Cor. 2:12; Col 4:3.) In the history of the church the
                     period represented by Philadelphia witnessed an unparalleled
                     missionary movement. It also marked renewed interest in the
                     study of the Bible and incomparable zeal in its distribution,
                     aided by the creation of Bible societies.
                       2. "Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan ... to
                     come and worship before thy feet" (verse 9). Whether this
                     refers to those of Jewish lineage, to false Christians, or to
                     pagans, the important fact is that the Saviour promised to make
                     them receptive to the gospel, to put them in contact with
                     genuine Christians, and to make Himself known to them. Facts
                     confirm this prophecy. Between 1816 and 1843 there was a
                     wave of conversions among Jews. Great religious revivals also
                     shook Protestantism, giving birth to the advent movement,
                     among others. And, finally, this era saw the birth of modern
                     missions—special missionary endeavor for pagan peoples.
                       3. "I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which
                     shall come upon all the world" (verse 10). This is a direct
                     reference to events to come upon the world at the end of time,
                     particularly during the time of trouble to come upon the in-
                     habitants of the world. (See Dan. 12:1; Matt. 24:21.)
                       The first part of this declaration made by the faithful and true
                     Witness has been fulfilled; it is an accomplished fact. The sec-
                     ond is still being fulfilled, but the third is in the future.

                       What are the Philadelphia Christians invited to hold fast?
                     Verse 11.

                        As long as the struggle lasts, as long as the course is not
                     finished (2 Tim. 4:7, 8), the promised crown of life can be
                     snatched away (Rev. 2:10, 11). This is an invitation to persever-
                     ance (Matt. 24:13; Heb. 10:36-39), all the more pertinent be-
                     cause the Lord announces His soon return: "Behold, I come
                     quickly."

THINK IT THROUGH      How can I meet more fully the Saviour's conditions for one
                     who wishes to be an instrument of action in His hands?

           Part 6  What singular privilege is promised to the overcomer in the
    "A PILLAR IN  Philadelphia church? What is the significance of this
   THE TEMPLE" metaphor?

                    "Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my
                   God, and he shall go no more out" (Rev. 3:12).

                     This promise harmonizes beautifully with the character and
                   work of the Philadelphia Christians. The victor, because of his
                   faithfulness in God's service, will become a pillar—symbol of
                   strength, stability, and victory (Gal. 2:9; 1 Tim. 3:15; Rev.
                   10:1)—in the temple of God; that is, in the very presence of God
                   (Rev. 21:3) for all eternity.

                    What further honor will the Saviour accord him? What is the
                   meaning of these distinguishing marks? Verse 12.

                      The overcomer will carry three names that will be his glory. In
                   the Bible the name always implies the personality, character,
                   and ownership of the bearer.
                     1. "The name of my God": The promise here is that the
                   Creator's image will be fully restored in the overcomer: he will
                   again belong to God.
                      2. "The name of the city of my God": The victor will have a
                   right to live in the New Jerusalem; he will be a citizen there. The
                   New Jerusalem will be his city.
                      3."My [Christ's] new name": The character of the overcomer
                   will perfectly reflect that of Jesus; he will be like Him, because
                   he will see Him as He is (1 John 3:2). Jesus will have a new name,
                   for He will have laid aside the form of a servant and appear in all
                   His glory.
                      The name of God in the forehead "signifies the yielding of the
                   mind to intelligent and loyal obedience to all of God's com-
                   mandments."—Sons and Daughters of God, p. 370.

        MESSAGE TO    Laodicean church? What are their significance?
          LAODICEA
                        "Unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write;
                      These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the
                      beginning of the creation of God" (Rev. 3:14).
                        In this final message Jesus presents Himself as the personifi-
                      cation of Amen (surely, indeed, truly), a title that the prophet
                      Isaiah applies to God (Isa. 65:16, translated "truth"). As the

                      ning or origin of God's creation, He is the Creator. (See John
                      1:3; Col. 1:15, 16; Heb. 1:2.) Under these titles Jesus claims
                      equality with God and emphasizes the seriousness of what He is
                      about to say. This role is consistent with the judgment era.
                        "Christ was God essentially, and in the highest sense. He was
                      with God from all eternity, God over all, blessed forevermore.
                        "The Lord Jesus Christ, the divine Son of God, existed from
                      eternity, a distinct person, yet one with the Father. He was the
                      surpassing glory of heaven. He was the commander of the
                      heavenly intelligences, and the adoring homage of the angels
                      was received by Him as His right... .
                        "There are light and glory in the truth that Christ was one with
                      the Father before the foundation of the world was laid. This is
                      the light shining in a dark place, making it resplendent with
                      divine, original glory. This truth, infinitely mysterious in itself,
                      explains other mysterious and otherwise unexplainable truths,

                      will not bear this straight testimony. They will rise up against it,
                      and this will cause a shaking among God's people.

           Part 2     How did Jesus evaluate the works of the Laodicean church?
  THE LUKEWARM
         CHURCH       "I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would
                    thou wert cold or hot" (Rev. 3:15).

                       Unlike all of the previous churches, Laodicea received no
                    commendation.
                       "The message to the church of the Laodiceans is a startling
                    denunciation, and is applicable to the people of God at the
                    present time."—Testimonies, vol. 3, p. 252.
                       "They are neither cold nor hot; they occupy a neutral posi-
                    tion, and at the same time flatter themselves that they are in
                    need of nothing. The True Witness hates this lukewarmness. He
                    loathes the indifference of this class of persons. Said He: 'I
                    would thou wert cold or hot.' "—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 87.

                      What seriously threatens those who are lukewarm? Verse
                    16.

                      Like lukewarm water, lukewarm spirituality produces nausea.
                    Of course, the threat of being rejected by the Saviour is not
                    unconditional; if it were, the counsels that follow would be
                    useless. It is a warning rather than a decision.
                       "Halfhearted Christians are worse than infidels; for their de-
                    ceptive words and noncommittal position lead many astray. The
                    infidel shows his colors. The lukewarm Christian deceives both

                        need of nothing" (Rev. 3:17).

                          This declaration explains the reason for the lukewarm condi-
                       tion of the Laodiceans. This can be understood in both the
                       literal and the spiritual sense. The Laodiceans were affluent, as
                       are a number of Christian societies today. At the same time, on
                       the spiritual plane, the treasures of God's Word have never been
                       more accessible.
                          It is always fatal to take pleasure in one's wealth, even in
                       spiritual riches. Not to recognize all these blessings as unmer-
                       ited favors from God leads to self-sufficiency, the taking of
                       credit to oneself. (See Luke 12:16-21..) The Spirit of God can act
                       only where there is poverty of spirit and a feeling of need. (See
                       Matt. 5:3; Luke 18:13, 14.)
                          "What greater deception can come upon human minds than a
                       confidence that they are right when they are all wrong! The
                       message of the True Witness finds the people of God in a sad
                       deception, yet honest in that deception. They know not that
                       their condition is deplorable in the sight of God."—Testimonies,
                       vol. 3, pp. 252, 253.

                          What is the true condition of the Laodiceans? Verse 17.

                          "What is it that constitutes the wretchedness, the nakedness,
                       of those who feel rich and increased with goods?—It is the want
                       of the righteousness of Christ. In their own righteousness they
                       are represented as clothed with filthy rags, and yet in this condi-
                       tion they flatter themselves that they are clothed upon with
                       Christ's righteousness. Could deception be greater?"—Ellen G.
                       White, Review and Herald, August 7, 1894.

THINK IT THROUGH         How can I see my spiritual condition as God sees it?

                           "In my last vision I was shown that even this decided message
                        of the True Witness had not accomplished the design of God.
                       -The people slumber on in their sins. They continue to declare
                        themselves rich and having need of nothing. Many inquire: Why
                        are all these reproofs given? Why do the Testimonies continu-
                        ally charge us with backsliding and with grievous sins? We love
                        the truth; we are prospering; we are in no need of these tes-
                        timonies of warning and reproof. But let these murmurers see
                        their hearts and compare their lives with the practical teachings
                        of the Bible, let them humble their souls before God, let the
                        grace of God illuminate the darkness, and the scales will fall
                        from their eyes, and they will realize their true spiritual poverty

The Church of the Last Days            LESSON 6                   ❑ Wednesday
                                                                        May 7

         Part 4   What counsel does the True Witness give to the Laodicean
     THE LORD'S Christians?
       COUNSEL
                  "I counsel thee to buy of me" (Rev. 3:18).

                      Instead of the transitory possessions of the Laodiceans,
                   Jesus offers the eternal riches that He alone can give. The fact
                   that the Lord counsels the Laodiceans to buy does not mean
                   that they are to make the purchase with money (Isa. 55:1), but
                   rather that they must negotiate an exchange of Laodicean pov-
                   erty for the riches of Christ. Although salvation is a free gift of
                   God, it costs man a great deal—all that he has. He must come to
                   the point that he esteems "the reproach of Christ greater riches
                   than the treasures in Egypt" (Heb. 11:26).
                      What is the significance of each one of the remedies the
                   Laodiceans are admonished to buy? The remedies counseled
                   by Jesus, like the many other symbols He used, are in the
                   language of the people He was addressing, here the commerce
                   that enriched the Laodiceans. Ellen White gives us this explana-
                   tion:
                       "The True Witness counsels us to buy of Him gold tried in the
                   fire, white raiment, and eyesalve. The gold here recommended
                   as having been tried in the fire is faith and love. It makes the
                    heart rich; for it has been purged until it is pure, and the more it
                    is tested the more brilliant is its luster. The white raiment is
                    purity of character, the righteousness of Christ imparted to the
                    sinner. This is indeed a garment of heavenly texture, that can be
                    bought only of Christ for a life of willing obedience. The
                    eyesalve is that wisdom and grace which enables us to discern
                    between the evil and the good, and to detect sin under any
                    guise. God has given His church eyes which He requires them to
                    anoint with wisdom, that they may see clearly."—Testimonies,
                    vol. 4, pp. 88, 89.

THINK IT THROUGH     Are we in a hopeless condition spiritually?

                     "The counsel of the true Witness does not represent those
                   who are lukewarm as in a hopeless case. There is yet a chance to
                   remedy their state, and the Laodicean message is full of en-
                   couragement; for the backslidden church may yet buy the gold
                   of faith and love, may yet have the white robe of the righteous-
                   ness of Christ, that the shame of their nakedness need not
                   appear. Purity of heart, purity of motive, may yet characterize
                   those who are halfhearted and who are striving to serve God
                   and mammon. They may yet wash their robes of character and
                   make them white in the blood of the Lamb."—Ellen G. White

                 Part 5      What prompts God to reprove and chasten?
       "BE ZEALOUS
          . . . , AND        "As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten" (Rev. 3:19).
            REPENT"
                            Our Lord's actions are always motivated by love, even when
                          He has to administer punishment. "The Lord reproves wrongs
                          in His people, but is this an evidence that He has rejected
                          them?—No. There are errors in the church, and the Lord points
                          them out by His own ordained agencies, not always through the
                          testimonies. Now shall we seize these reproofs and make capi-
                          tal of them, and say that God is not imparting to them His light
                          and love?—No. The work that God is trying to do for them shows
                          that He loves them, and wants to draw them away from paths of
                          danger."—Selected Messages, bk. 2, pp. 81, 82.

                            What should be the objective of reprimand or chastening?
                          Verse 19.
                              After the counsel, the fatherly warning, God expects positive
                          results. (See Rom. 2:4.)
                              The call here is in the imperative: "Be zealous therefore, and
                          repent." In the original the word translated as "zealous" is from
                          the same root as the word "hot," which the Laodicean church
                          had failed to be. "The Laod iceans are called upon to experience
                          the warmth and enthusiasm that comes with true repentance,
                          consecration, and devotion to Christ."—S.D.A. Bible Commen-
                          tary, vol. 7, p. 763.
                              "Repentance includes sorrow for sin and a turning away from
                          it. We shall not renounce sin unless we see its sinfulness; until
                           we turn away from it in heart, there will be no real change in the
                          life."—Steps to Christ, p. 23.

                          this appeal?
                             "I saw that this call to the Laodicean church will affect souls.
                          A becoming zeal is called for by God on our part. We must
                          repent, throw away our whole feelings, feel our destitution, buy
                          gold that we may be rich, eyesalve that we may see, white
                          raiment that we may be clothed."—Ellen G. White Comments,

                          individual cases. Are we poor, and blind, and wretched, and

                          martyrs. The conflict is for us, in these days of subtle temptation

           Part 6      What urgent invitation is Jesus still extending? How should
      PROMISE TO    it be understood?
  THE OVERCOMER
                      "Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my
                    voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with
                    him, and he with me" (Rev. 3:20).

                      Here Jesus crowns His love for Laodicea. Indifferent to coun-
                    sel, to threat, and to command; perhaps His people will respond
                    to the personal, loving approach. As a humble traveler, going
                    from door to door, Jesus comes to offer His remedies to who-
                    ever is willing to open to Him. The promised supper symbolizes
                    personal communion with Christ, without which spiritual life is
                    impossible.
                       However, this spiritual interpretation does not exclude the
                    possibility of applying this verse to last-day events. The expres-
                    sion "I am standing at the door" (Jerusalem) also calls to mind
                    the end of time. (See Matt. 24:33; James 5:9.) Also a meal with
                    Jesus reminds one of the promised supper of the Lamb that the
                    elect will eat with Jesus in the kingdom of heaven. (See Matt.
                    26:29; Luke 22:30; Rev. 19:9).

                      What particular promise does Jesus make to the overcomer
                    in the last church? Verse 21.

                      This promise is in direct relation with the preceding one. It
                    gives a logical conclusion to the letter and to all seven epistles.
                    The cycle ends with a promise of victory for Christ and His
                    church. The Lord is anxious to share with the victorious of all
                    ages the royal home that He will occupy for all eternity with His
                    Father. It is the greatest honor offered to the overcomer. (See
                    Dan. 7:27; Matt. 25:31-34; Rev. 20:4.)

THINK IT THROUGH      Although every church received a promise, and all are called
                    to victory, there is, in reality, only one way to be victorious. Do
                    you know what it is?

                       "The example of Christ shows us that our only hope of victory
                    is in continual resistance of Satan's attacks. He who triumphed
                    over the adversary of souls in the conflict of temptations under-
                    stands Satan's power over the race, and has conquered him in
                    our behalf. As an overcomer, He has given us the advantage of
                    His victory, that in our efforts to resist the temptations of Satan
                    we may unite our weakness to His strength, our worthlessness
                    to His merits. And sustained by His enduring might under the
                    strength of temptation, we may resist in His all-powerful name,
                    and overcome as He overcame."—Messages to Young People,

                         "Ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern
                       the signs of the times?" (Matt. 16:3).

                          From the evidence given us, when Jesus spoke of the "signs
                       of the times," He was referring to specific signs foretold by the
                       prophets to enable His people to discern Messianic time. There-
                       fore, these signs had chronological value and were given to
                       mark the arrival of events foretold.
                          Jesus gave public proof of His Messiahship, which the Gospel
                       writer reported thus: "The throng wondered, when they saw the
                       dumb speaking, the maimed whole, the lame walking, and the
                       blind seeing, and they glorified the God of Israel" (Matt. 15:31,
                       RSV). Then, having witnessed the miracle of the feeding of the
                       5000, the people said to one another, "This is of a truth that
                       prophet that should come into the world" (John 6:14), and they
                       wanted to proclaim Hirri King (verse 15).

                         What biblical proof do we have that the Jews knew that the
                       time of the Messiah had come? Luke 3:15, 16; 2:25, 26.

                           "The waning power of Israel testified that the Messiah's
                       coming was at hand. The prophecy of Daniel pictured the glory
                       of His reign over an empire which should succeed all earthly
                       kingdoms; and, said the prophet, 'It shall stand forever.' Dan.
                       2:44. While few understood the nature of Christ's mission, there
                       was a widespread expectation of a mighty prince who should
                       establish his kingdom in Israel and who should come as deli-
                       verer to the nations."—The Desire of Ages, p. 34.

THINK IT THROUGH         Do I have greater discernment of the signs of the time in
                       which I live than did those who lived during Christ's first
                       advent?

                          "Faith in the soon coming of Christ is waning. 'My Lord
                       delayeth His coming' is not only said in the heart, but expressed
                       in words and most decidedly in works. Stupidity in this watching
                       time is sealing the senses of God's people as to the signs of the
                       times. The terrible iniquity which abounds calls for the greatest
                       diligence and for the living testimony, to keep sin out of the
                       church. Faith has been decreasing to a fearful degree, and it is
                       only by exercise that it can increase."—Testimonies, vol. 3, pp.

           Part 2     How does the New Testament confirm that Jesus came "in
          IN THE    the fulness of the time"?
       FULLNESS
         OF TIME      "Now ... Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of
                    the kingdom of God, and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the
                    kingdom of God is at hand" (Mark 1:14, 15).
                      "When the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his
                    Son" (Gal. 4:4).
                       "As the message of Christ's first advent announced the king-
                    dom of His grace, so the message of His second advent an-
                    nounces the kingdom of His glory. And the second message,
                    like the first, is based on the prophecies."—The Desire of Ages,
                    p. 234.

                      Which of Daniel's prophecies permitted Israel to know the
                    time of the Messiah's advent? Dan. 9:24-27.
                       "The natural method of calculating these weeks is to consider
                    them consecutive, that is, the 62 weeks begin where the 7 weeks
                    end. These divisions are components of the 70 weeks men-
                    tioned in verse 24 thus: 7+62+1=70. . . .
                       "Beginning with the autumn of 457 B.C., when the decree
                    went into effect, 69 prophetic weeks, or 483 years, reach to the
                    baptism of Jesus in 27 A.D. . . .
                       " ... When these figures are applied to Christ, His ministry and
                    death, and the gospel to the Jews, perfect synchronism is
                    achieved."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 4, pp. 853, 854.

                    affected my mind,' he says, 'was the chronology of the Scrip-
                    tures.... I found that predicted events, which had been fulfilled
                    in the past, often occurred within a given time. The one hundred
                    and twenty years to the flood (Genesis 6:3); the seven days that
                    were to precede it, with forty days of predicted rain (Genesis
                    7:4); the four hundred years of the sojourn of Abraham's seed
                    (Genesis 15:13); the three days of the butler's and baker's
                    dreams (Genesis 40:12-20); the seven years of Pharaoh's
                    [dream] (Genesis 41:28-54); the forty years in the wilderness
                    (Numbers 14:34); the three and a half years of famine (1 Kings
                    17:1); . . . the seventy years' captivity (Jeremiah 25:11);
                    Nebuchadnezzar's seven times (Daniel 4:13-16); and the seven
                    weeks, threescore and two weeks, and the one week, making
                    seventy weeks, determined upon the Jews (Daniel 9:24-27),—
                     the events limited by these times were all once only a matter of
                     prophecy, and were fulfilled in accordance with predictions.'—

                                                                              May 13
             Part 3     What certainty do we have that there is a time appointed for
          THE TIME    the end?
         APPOINTED
       FOR THE END      "At the time appointed the end shall be" (Dan. 8:19).
                        "The end shall be at the time appointed (Dan. 11:27).
                        "The time of the end ... is yet for a time appointed" (Dan.
                      11:35).

                         These verses should be considered along with Daniel 8:17;
                      11:40; 12:4, 9 where the expression "the time of the end" is also
                      used. These words are synonymous with the expression "the
                      last days." The time appointed for the end must be considered
                      in the frame of Daniel's prophecies, which establish the exact
                      beginning of the period in human history that the prophets and
                      the apostles call "the last days."

                        What prophecy in the book of Daniel allows us to determine
                      the exact year of the beginning of "the time of the end"? Dan.
                      7:25; 12:7.

                         This prophecy is mentioned seven times in the Bible: twice in
                      the book of Daniel, and five times in the Revelation (11 :2,3; 12:6,
                      14; 13:5), revealing how important it was to God that man know
                      and understand His plan. The time period is reported in three
                      different ways: in prophetic days, in prophetic months, and in
                      prophetic years. Twice the period is given as 1260 days, twice as
                      42 months, and three times as three years and a half; all of which
                      give exactly the same period of time-1260 literal years.
                         "The periods here mentioned . . . are the same, alike repre-
                      senting the time in which the church of Christ was to suffer
                      oppression from Rome. The 1260 years of papal supremacy
                      began in A.D. 538, and would therefore terminate in 1798.... At
                      that time a French army entered Rome and made the pope a
                      prisoner, and he died in exile."—TheGreatControversy, p.266.

                      the times declare that the coming of Christ is near at hand. The

           Part 4     When Daniel desired to know the meaning of the prophecy
        A SEALED    of the last days, what did the angel tell him?
            BOOK
                       "Thou, 0 Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even
                    to the time of the end."
                       "Go thy way, Daniel: for the words are closed up and sealed
                    till the time of the end" (Dan. 12:4, 9).

                       "This instruction did not apply to the whole of the book of
                    Daniel, for a portion of the message has been understood and
                    thus been a blessing to believers for centuries. It applied, rather,
                    to that part of Daniel's prophecy that dealt with the last days. (AA
                    585; DA 234). Not until that time was reached could a message,
                    based on the fulfillment of these prophecies, be proclaimed."

                      "In the Revelation all the books of the Bible meet and end.
                    Here is the complement of the book of Daniel. One is a
                    prophecy; the other a revelation. The book that was sealed is
                    not the Revelation, but that portion of the prophecy of Daniel
                    relating to the last days."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 585.
                      "The book of Daniel is unsealed in the revelation to John, and

                      "The last book of the New Testament Scriptures is full of truth
                    that we need to understand. Satan has blinded the minds of
                    many so that they have been glad of any excuse for not making
                    the Revelation their study. But Christ through His servant John
                    has here declared what shall be in the last days; and He says,
                    'Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this
                    prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein.' "

               Part 5   What marvelous promise was made to Daniel concerning
        KNOWLEDGE the sealed prophecies in his book?
     SHALL INCREASE
                        "Many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be in-
                      creased."
                        "The wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall
                      understand; but the wise shall understand" (Dan. 12:4, 10).

                        "Knowledge shall be increased. This clause may be con-
                      sidered the logical sequel to the immediately preceding clause:
                      When the sealed book is opened at the time of the end, knowl-
                      edge concerning the truths contained in these prophecies will
                      be increased.... At the end of the 18th and the beginning of the
                      19th century a new interest in the prophecies of Daniel and the
                      Revelation was awakened in widely separated places of earth.
                      The study of these prophecies led to a widespread belief that the
                      second advent of Christ was near. Numerous expositors in
                      England, Joseph Wolff in the Middle East, Manuel Lacunza in
                      South America, and William Miller in the United States, together
                      with a host of other students of the prophecies, declared, on the
                      basis of their study of the prophecies of Daniel, that the second
                      advent was at hand ."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 4, p. 879.

                        In what does true wisdom consist? Job 28:28; Dan. 12:3.

                        The wise man with intelligence and understanding is happy,
                      not only to fear God and isolate himself from evil; he also
                      desires to teach others, to share what he has been privileged to
                      receive. "Whosoever shall do and teach them [these least com-
                      mandments], the same shall be called great in the kingdom of
                      heaven" (Matt. 5:19).

THINK IT THROUGH        How can I have that intelligence which, according to the
                      Bible, is powerful enough to overcome evil?

                        Imitate the apostle Paul, who, we are told, after Jesus, was
                      "the most illustrious teacher that this world has known."—

                        "While he possessed high intellectual endowments, the life of
                      Paul revealed the power of a rarer wisdom. Principles of deep-

"You Know What Hour It Is"           LESSON 7                         ❑    Friday
                                                                          May 16

          Part 6     What should be the logical consequence of being aware of
      HIGH TIME    the day and the hour in which we are living?
      TO AWAKE
                     "And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to
                   awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when
                   we believed. The night is far spent, the day is at hand" (Rom.
                   13:11, 12).

                     This is the reasoning logically followed by all who have
                   preached the coming of God's kingdom. Matthew summarizes
                   the message of John the Baptist in these words: "Repent ye: for
                   the kingdom of heaven is at hand" (Matt. 3:2), Jesus preached
                   the same message (Mark 1:15), and the risen Christ urges the
                   Laodicean community to repent.

                     How did Jesus describe the condition of the believers while
                   they await His return? Matt. 25:5, 6.

                     "All who wait for the heavenly Bridegroom are represented in
                   the parable as slumbering because their Lord delayed His com-
                   ing; but the wise roused themselves at the message of His
                   approach, and responded to the message, and their spiritual
                   discernment was not all gone, and they sprang into line."—
                   Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p.
                   1099.

                     According to the apostle Paul, what should a person do
                   because "the day is at hand"? Rom. 13:12-14.

                      "A revival of true godliness among us is the greatest and most
                   urgent of all our needs. To seek this should be our first work."
                   —Selected Messages, bk. 1, p. 121.
                      But what is revival? "Revival signifies a renewal of spiritual
                   life, a quickening of the powers of mind and heart, a resurrec-
                   tion from spiritual death."—Selected Messages, bk. 1, p. 128.
                   Revival should lead to reformation; that is, "reorganization, a
                   change in ideas and theories, habits and practices."—Selected
                   Messages, bk. 1, p. 128.

THINK IT THROUGH     What should I do to help bring a revival in the church?

                     "Are we awake to the work that is going on in the heavenly
                   sanctuary, or are we waiting for some compelling power to
                   come upon the church before we shall arouse? Are we hoping
                   to see the whole church revived? That time will never come.
                     "There are persons in the church who are not converted, and
                   who will not unite in earnest, prevailing prayer. We must enter
                   upon the work individually. We must pray more, and talk less."

              Part 1   How does the Bible confirm the certainty of a universal
        A UNIVERSAL judgment?
          JUDGMENT
                       "We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that
                     every one may receive the things done in his body, according
                     to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad" (2 Cor. 5:10).
                     (Compare Eccl. 3:17; 12:14.)
                        The entire Bible positively affirms the fact that at the end of
                      human history every man will have to pass before the judgment
                      bar of God. No one will be able to escape; every man's works will
                      be judged. God will "render to every man according to his
                      deeds" (Rom. 2:6).

                        What other facts does Paul give concerning the judgment?
                      Acts 17:30, 31; 24:25.
                        The proclamation of a "judgment to come" was the basis of
                      apostolic preaching. How much more should it be the subject of
                      today's preaching, now that "the hour of ... judgment is come"!
                         "This judgment does not take place at death. Mark the words
                      of Paul: 'He hath appointed a day, in the which He will judge the
                      world in righteousness by that Man whom He hath ordained.'
                      Acts 17:31. . . . Here the apostle plainly stated that a specified
                      time, then future, had been fixed upon for the judgment of the
                      world. . . .
                        "But if the dead are already enjoying the bliss of heaven or
                      writhing in the flames of hell, what need of a future judgment?"

THINK IT THROUGH        What should be the result of my belief that I must give
                      account one day of my actions, words, and thoughts?
                        "In the judgment the use made of every talent will be
                      scrutinized. How have we employed the capital lent us of
                      Heaven? Will the Lord at His coming receive His own with
                      usury? Have we improved the powers entrusted us, in hand and
                      heart and brain, to the glory of God and the blessing of the
                      world? How have we used our time, our pen, our voice, our
                      money, our influence? What have we done for Christ, in the
                      person of the poor, the afflicted, the orphan, or the widow? God
                      has made us the depositaries of His holy word; what have we
                      done with the light and truth given us to make men wise unto
                      salvation? No value is attached to a mere profession of faith in
                      Christ; only the love which is shown by works is counted
                      genuine. Yet it is love alone which in the sight of Heaven makes
                      any act of value. Whatever is done from love, however small it
                      may appear in the estimation of men, is accepted and rewarded
                      of God."—The Great Controversy, p. 487.

                                                                         May 19
           Part 2    What description does Daniel give of the judgment?
   THE 2300 DAYS    Chronologically, what event does it follow? Dan. 7:9,10, 25, 26.

                      These verses give the chronological order of two events of
                    utmost importance: first, the judgment takes place at the time
                    that a prolongation of life is accorded to the earthly powers for
                    "a season and a time" (verse 12) and "one like the Son of man"
                    appears before "the ancient of days" (verse 13); second, this
                    judgment follows the fulfillment of the prophecy of the 1260
                    years of papal supremacy which ended in 1798 (verse 25).
                       ''It is He [God the Father], the source of all being, and the
                    fountain of all law, that is to preside in the judgment. And holy
                    angels as ministers and witnesses, in number 'ten thousand
                    times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands,' attend this
                    great tribunal."—Th9 Great Controversy, p. 479.

                       What other prophecy should we study diligently, because of
                    its close relation to the "time of the end"? Dan. 8:14, 17.

                       Paul clearly stated that God "hath appointed a day, in the
                    which he will judge the world in righteousness" (Acts 17:31).
                    God appointed that day, and it was He who revealed the precise
                    date of the 2300-day prophecy, a prophetic period spanning
                    2300 years, whose starting point was the same as that of the
                    70-week prophecy which fixed the date of the Messiah's first
                    advent. The starting point for both was 457 B.C., when Ar-
                    taxerxes authorized the rebuilding and restoration of
                    Jerusalem.
                       "Taking this as the starting point, there was perfect harmony
                    in the application of all the events foretold in the explanation of
                    that period in Daniel 9:25-27. . . . The seventy weeks, or 490
                    years, were to pertain especially to the Jews. At the expiration of
                    this period the nation sealed its rejection of Christ by the perse-
                    cution of His disciples, and the apostles turned to the Gentiles,
                    A.D. 34. The first 490 years of the 2300 having then ended, 1810
                    years would remain. From A.D. 34, 1810 years extend to 1844.
                    'Then,' said the angel, 'shall the sanctuary be cleansed.' All the
                    preceding specifications of the prophecy had been unques-
                    tionably fulfilled at the time appointed."—The Great Controversy,

                      "Such subjects as the sanctuary, in connection with the 2300
                    days . . . , are perfectly calculated to explain the past Advent
                    movement and show what our present position is, establish the

            Part 3   What event was to mark the end of the 2300 years? Of what
     THE CLEANSING sanctuary is the prophet speaking?
           OF THE
       SANCTUARY     "He said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred
                   days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed" (Dan. 8:14). (See
                   also Heb. 8:1, 2; 9:11, 24.)

                        "The term 'sanctuary,' as used in the Bible, refers, first, to the
                     tabernacle built by Moses, as a pattern of heavenly things; and,
                     secondly, to the 'true tabernacle' in heaven, to which the earthly
                     sanctuary pointed. At the death of Christ the typical service
                     ended. The 'true tabernacle' in heaven is the sanctuary of the
                     new covenant. And as the prophecy of Daniel 8:14 is fulfilled in
                     this dispensation, the sanctuary to which it refers must be the
                     sanctuary of the new covenant. At the termination of the 2300
                     days, in 1844, there had been no sanctuary on earth for many
                     centuries. Thus the prophecy [of the 2300 days] unquestionably
                     points to the sanctuary in heaven."—The Great Controversy,
                     p. 417.
                        What does the cleansing of the sanctuary mean?
                      "Christ's daily ministration as our high priest was typified in
                      the daily services. The annual Day of Atonement typified a work
                     that Christ would undertake at the close of the age. For a
                     detailed discussion of these two phases of service see . . . GC
                     418-423. The prophecy of Dan. 8:14 announces the time for the
                      beginning of this special work. The cleansing of the heavenly
                      sanctuary comprehends the entire work of final judgment, be-
                     ginning with the investigative phase and ending with the execu-
                     tive phase, which results in the permanent eradication of sin from
                     the universe."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 4, pp. 844, 845.
                        "The cleansing of the sanctuary therefore involves a work of
                     investigation—a work of judgment. This work must be per-
                     formed prior to the coming of Christ to redeem His people; for
                     when He comes, His reward is with Him to give to every man
                     according to his works. Revelation 22:12."—The Great Con-
                     troversy, p. 422.

THINK IT THROUGH       What is my condition in this fearful and solemn time?

                       "Shall we not search the Scriptures, that we may know where
                     we are in this world's history? Shall we not become intelligent in
                     regard to the work that is being accomplished for us at this time,
                     and the position that we as sinners should occupy while this
                     work of atonement is going forward? If we have any regard for

"The Hour of . . Judgment Is Come"                 LESSON 8 ❑ Wednesday
                                                                 May 21
           Part 4   With whom does the investivative judgment begin?
             THE
   INVESTIGATIVE    "The time is come that judgment must begin at the house of
      JUDGMENT God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them
                  that obey not the gospel of God" (1 Peter 4:17).

                     "In the typical service only those who had come before God
                   with confession and repentance, and whose sins, through the
                   blood of the sin offering, were transferred to the sanctuary, had
                   a part in the service of the Day of Atonement. So in the great day
                   of final atonement and investigative judgment the only cases
                   considered are those of the professed people of God. The
                   judgment of the wicked is a distinct and separate work, and
                   takes place at a later period. 'Judgment must begin at the house
                   of God.' "—The Great Controversy, p. 480.
                     "Beginning with those who first lived upon the earth, our
                   Advocate presents the cases of each successive generation,
                   and closes with the living."—The Great Controversy, p. 483.

                     Why does the investigative judgment take place before the
                   return of Jesus? (See Matt. 25:31-33; 13:47-50.)

                      A previous judgment must take place in order that a separa-
                   tion can be made between the just and the wicked at the return
                   of Jesus. In effect, "when the work of the investigative judgment
                   closes, the destiny of all will have been decided for life or death.
                   Probation is ended for a short time before the appearing of the
                   Lord in the clouds of heaven."—The Great Controversy, p. 490.
                      "It is for the benefit of all created beings that the facts with
                   respect to each person's fate should be known, as an assurance
                   to all that justice has been done and as a guarantee of the
                   eternal stability of the divine government."—S.D.A. Ency-
                   clopedia, art. "Investigative Judgment."

                   my faith in Jesus Christ?

                     "Solemn are the scenes connected with the closing work of
                   the atonement. Momentous are the interests involved therein.
                   The judgment is now passing in the sanctuary above. For many
                   years this work has been in progress. Soon—none know how
                   soon—it will pass to the cases of the living. In the awful pres-
                   ence of God our lives are to come up in review. At this time
                   above all others it behooves every soul to heed the Saviour's
                   admonition: 'Watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.'
                   Mark 13:33. 'If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on
                   thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come
                   upon thee.' Revelation 3:3."—The Great Controversy, p. 490.

         WITNESS
                       "This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the
                     world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end
                     come" (Matt. 24:14).

                       Because God "will have all men to be saved, and to come unto
                     the knowledge of the truth" (1 Tim. 2:4), He has periodically sent
                     special messengers into the world. What He did in times past—
                     for the antediluvians, for Sodom and Gomorrah, for Nineveh,
                     and for Jerusalem—God also wishes to do for the world just
                     prior to the end of its history.
                       The progress of the spread of the gospel throughout the
                     world, from the beginning of the nineteenth century until our
                     day, constitutes a sign of the times of great significance. The
                     good news has been preached in most of the world. And, as for
                     the written testimony, no other book has known such wide-
                     spread distribution throughout the world, nor has any other
                     been translated into so many languages as the Bible. Only a few
                     people in the world today do not have access to at least some
                     part of Scripture in their own tongue.

                       At the time of the investigative judgment, what special mes-
                     sage was to be given to the world? Rev. 14:6.

                        "The Lord God of heaven will not send upon the world His
                     judgments for disobedience and transgression until He has sent
                     His watchmen to give the warning. He will not close up the
                     period of probation until the message shall be more distinctly
                     proclaimed."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 19.
                       "In the prophecy [referring to the first angel of Revelation 14]
                     this warning of the judgment, with its connected messages, is
                     followed by the coming of the Son of man in the clouds of
                     heaven. The proclamation of the judgment is an announcement
                     of Christ's second coming as at hand. And this proclamation is
                     called the everlasting gospel."—Christ's Object Lessons, p.
                     227.

THINK IT THROUGH       Since God has greatly favored me by giving me the everlast-
                     ing gospel, what is my responsibility in its proclamation?

                        "The work of preaching the gospel has not been connected to
                     angels, but has been entrusted to men. Holy angels have been
                     employed in directing this work, they have in charge the great
                     movements for the salvation of men; but the actual proclama-
                     tion of the gospel is performed by the servants of Christ upon
                     the earth."—The Great Controversy, p. 312.

                                                                         May 23
         Part 6  Which phase of the judgment will take place during the
 THE MILLENNIUM millennium? Who will take part in it?

                    "I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was
                  given unto them: ... and they lived and reigned with Christ a
                  thousand years. But the rest of the dead lived not again until
                  the thousand years were finished.... Blessed and holy is he
                  that hath part in the first resurrection: ... they shall be priests
                  of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand
                  years" (Rev. 20:4-6).
                    "Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? ...
                  Know ye not that we shall judge angels?" (1 Cor. 6:2, 3).

                      "SDA's understand that the great final judgment involves
                   three steps: (1) an investigative judgment, by which those eligi-
                   ble to eternal life are separated from those who are not eligible
                    in a pre-Advent investigation; (2) an examination of the indi-
                    vidual cases of the wicked by the righteous, during the millen-
                    nium, to assure the latter that justice is being done in each case
                   and to determine the sentence to be meted out in each case;
                   and (3) the executive judgment, which takes place at the close
                  . of the millennium, when sentence is executed in the fires of
                    hell."—S.D.A. Encyclopedia, art. "Judgment."
                      The judgment in which the saints take part involves two sets
                    of records: first, the cases of men who loved the world more
                   than God; and, second, those of "angels which kept not their
                   first estate, but left their own habitation" (Jude 6).

                     What is the last phase of God's judgment? Rev. 20:11-15.

                     After everyone's case has been decided—first, those of the
                   household of God (investigative judgment); then, those of the
                   world and of fallen angels (during the millennium)—comes the
                   solemn moment of the judgment proclamation.
                     "In the presence of the assembled inhabitants of earth and
                   heaven the final coronation of the Son of God takes place. And
                   now, invested with supreme majesty and power, the King of
                   kings pronounces sentence upon the rebels against His govern-
                   ment and executes justice upon those who have transgressed
                   His law and oppressed His people."—The Great Controversy,
                   p. 666.
                      "The whole wicked world stand arraigned at the bar of God on
                   the charge of high treason against the government of heaven.
                   They have none to plead their cause; they are without excuse;
                   and the sentence of eternal death is pronounced against
                   them."—The Great Controversy, p. 668.

           GOSPEL       "I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the
                      everlasting gospel" (Rev. 14:6).
                          "This is a symbolic vision. The angel represents God's saints
                      engaged in the task of proclaiming the everlasting gospel,
                      especially the features mentioned in this verse, at a time when
                      the 'judgment is come' (v. 7). It is, of course, also true that literal
                      angels assist men in the task of proclaiming the gospel, but this
                      is not the predominant idea here. . . .
                            ... The area of flight indicates the worldwide nature of the
                      angel's work and message. The work grows and develops until
                      it is brought to the sight and hearing of all mankind.
                          " . .. Only here is the word 'everlasting' used in connection
                      with the gospel of the grace of God. There is but one gospel to
                      save men. It will continue as long as there are men to be saved.
                      There never will be another gospel."—S.D.A. Bible Commen-

                        For what purpose is the everlasting gospel given, and how
                      should it be proclaimed? Rev. 14:6, 7.
                         Literally, this means "an everlasting gospel to evangelize."
                      The gospel of salvation has been given to man through
                      evangelization. Just as there is no other gospel by which man
                      can be saved, so there is only one means provided by God for
                      the proclamation of the gospel on earth.
                         "The fact that an angel is said to be the herald of this warning
                      is significant. By the purity, the glory, and the power of the
                      heavenly messenger, divine wisdom has been pleased to repre-

                      the angel's flight 'in the midst of heaven,' the 'loud voice' with
                      which the warning is uttered, and its promulgation to all 'that

                   commands. The first expresses the basic condition for recon-
                   ciliation with God: Fear God. This call is particularly appropriate
                   in our day—the time of the end, the judgment hour—because
                   most men no longer fear God, nor do they even care to know
                   Him. (See Rom. 1:28.) "Who knowing the judgment of God, that
                   they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do
                   the same, but have pleasure in them that do them" (Rom. 1:32).
                      The word "fear" "is used here not in the sense of being afraid
                   of God, but in the sense of coming to Him with reverence and
                   awe. It conveys the thought of absolute loyalty to God, of full
                   surrender to His will. . . .
                      "The message to fear God is especially timely in the period
                   represented by the preaching of this angel, for men are worship-
                   ing gods of materialism and pleasure and many others of their
                   own devising."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 827.

                     Give several examples that justify giving a positive mean-
                   ing to the expression "fear of God." Ps. 111:10; 25:14; Acts
                   10:2; Rev. 11:18.

                      The word "fear" in the Bible is used with varied meanings,
                   from that of fright to reverence and love for God. Thus the
                   judgment, an event that will make sinners tremble with fear, will
                   also be a time when God will reward them that fear His name.
                   Fear can also express unbelief. And while it is true that "perfect
                   love casteth out fear" (1 John 4:18), it is also written that we
                   should perfect "holiness in the fear of God" (2 Cor. 7:1). And
                   finally, the Scripture reports, "the churches ... walking in the
                   fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were
                   multiplied" (Acts 9:31).

THINK IT THROUGH     In a world that no longer fears God, how do I regard God in
                   the privacy of my soul?

                      "Christ's followers today should guard against the tendency
                   to lose the spirit of reverence and godly fear. The Scriptures
                   teach men how they should approach their Maker—with humil-
                   ity and awe, through faith in a divine Mediator.. ..
                      "True reverence for God is inspired by a sense of His infinite
                   greatness and a realization of His presence. With this sense of
                   the Unseen, every heart should be deeply impressed."—

           Part 3  What second command Is contained in the first angel's
        GIVE HIM message?
          GLORY
                  "Give glory to him" (Rev. 14:7).

                      It is man's duty to recognize and extol the glory of God. Man
                   was created to be in "the image and glory of God" (1 Cor. 11:7).
                   Likewise, God purchased a people "unto the praise of his glory"
                   (Eph. 1:14). And when the Lord enters into His kingdom, the
                   redeemed will exclaim to one another, "Let us be glad and
                   rejoice, and give honour to him" (Rev. 19:6, 7). "Give glory to
                   him" should be the lifelong objective of God's creatures. It was
                   that of Jesus (John 7:18), and at the end of His earthly ministry
                   He was able to say, "I have glorified thee on the earth: I have
                   finished the work which thou gayest me to do" (John 17:4).

                     Following the example of Jesus, how can we glorify God on
                   earth? Matt. 5:16; John 15:8; 1 Peter 2:12.

                      "The good works of the children of God are the most effectual
                   preaching that the unbeliever has."—Testimonies,vol. 1, p. 193.
                      "In the night of spiritual darkness God's glory is to shine
                   through His church in lifting up the bowed down and comfort-
                   ing those that mourn."—Prophets and Kings, p. 718.
                      "As Sabbathkeeping Adventists we profess to obey all God's
                   commandments and to be looking for the coming of our Re-
                   deemer. A most solemn message of warning has been entrusted
                   to God's faithful few. We should show by our words and works
                   that we recognize the great responsibility laid upon us. Our light
                   should shine so clearly that others can see that we glorify the
                   Father in our daily lives; that we are connected with heaven and
                   are joint heirs with Jesus Christ, that when He shall appear in

                   has entrusted us with talents in order that we may use them for

                   fields of corn and wheat, but earnest, persevering work for the
                   salvation of souls. Every stone in God's temple must be a living

A Message for Our Time          LESSON 9                           ❑ Wednesday
                                                                        May 28

          Part 4     What is the purpose of the first angel's call?
       WORSHIP
   THE CREATOR       "Worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea,
                   and the fountains of waters" (Rev. 14:7).

                     "The worship of God is in contrast with the worship of the
                   beast (ch. 13:8, 12) and that of its image (v. 15). In the crisis soon
                   to come, the inhabitants of the earth will be called upon to make
                   their choice, as did the three Hebrew worthies in days of old,
                   between the worship of the true God and that of false gods (Dan.
                   3). The message of the first angel is designed to prepare men to
                   make the proper choice and to stand firm in the time of crisis.
                        . . . The appeal to worship God as Creator has become
                   especially timely in the years following the initial preaching of
                   the first angel's message, because of the rapid spread of the
                   theory of evolution. Furthermore, the call to worship the God of
                   heaven as Creator of all things implies that due heed be given to
                   the sign of God's creative works—the Sabbath of the Lord.... If
                   the Sabbath had been kept as God intended, it would have
                   served as a great safeguard against infidelity and evolution (see
                   Acts 14:15; PP 336). The Sabbath will be a point especially
                   controverted in the closing crisis."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary,
                   vol. 7, p. 828.

                     To which temptation is today's world particularly sub-
                   jected? How did Jesus meet it? Matt. 4:8-10.

                     "With the same temptation Satan approaches men, and here
                   he has better success than with Christ. To men he offers the
                   kingdom of this world on condition that they will acknowledge
                   his supremacy. He requires that they sacrifice integrity, disre-
                   gard conscience, indulge selfishness.... Satan walks by their
                   side and says: Whatever may be true in regard to life eternal, in
                   order to make a success in this world you must serve me. I hold
                   your welfare in my hands. I can give you riches, pleasures,
                   honor, and happiness."—The Desire of Ages, p. 130.

THINK IT THROUGH     If I looked upon the world as it really is, would not the
                   temptation to worship false gods be less enticing?

                     "Before His [Christ's] sight the tempter held the kingdoms of
                   the world. As Satan saw them, they possessed great external
                   grandeur. But Christ saw them in a different aspect, just as they
                   were—earthly dominions under the power of a tyrant. He saw
                   humanity full of woe, suffering under the oppressive power of
                   Satan. He saw the earth defiled by hatred, revenge, malice, lust,
                   and murder. He saw fiends in the possession of the bodies and
                   souls of men."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Com-

             Part 5   What has been the attitude of sinners toward the Creator?
         WORSHIP—
         FALSE AND    "When they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither
              TRUE were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and
                    their foolish heart was darkened."
                      "Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped
                    and served the creature more than the Creator, who is
                    blessed for ever" (Rom. 1:21, 25). (Compare Rom. 1:18-25; 2
                    Peter 3:5.)

                        "A terrible picture of the condition of the world has been
                     presented before me. Immorality abounds everywhere. Licen-
                     tiousness is the special sin of this age. Never did vice lift its
                     deformed head with such boldness as now.
                        "I was referred to Romans 1:18-32, as a true description of the
                     world previous to the second appearing of Christ."—Child
                     Guidance, p. 440.

                       What instructions did our Lord give concerning the proper
                      way to worship God? John 4:21-24.

                       "Not by seeking a holy mountain or a sacred temple are men
                     brought into communion with heaven. Religion is not to be
                     confined to external forms and ceremonies. The religion that
                     comes from God is the only religion that will lead to God. In
                     order to serve Him aright, we must be born of the divine Spirit.
                     This will purify the heart and renew the mind, giving us a new
                     capacity for knowing and loving God. It will give us a willing
                     obedience to all His requirements. This is true worship.... For
                     such worshipers He is seeking. He waits to receive them, and to
                     make them His sons and daughters."—The Desire of Ages, p.
                     189.

THINK IT THROUGH        Why do you worship God? What feelings do you experience
                     in your worship?

                       "It should be a pleasure to worship the Lord and to take part in
                     His work. God would not have His children, for whom so great
                     salvation has been provided, act as if He were a hard, exacting
                     taskmaster. He is their best friend; and when they worship Him,
                     He expects to be with them, to bless and comfort them, filling
                     their hearts with joy and love. . . . He desires that those who
                     come to worship Him shall carry away with them precious
                     thoughts of His care and love, that they may be cheered in all the
                     employments of daily life, that they may have grace to deal
                     honestly and faithfully in all things."—Steps to Christ, p. 103.

          Part 6     From a practical viewpoint, what constitutes worship?
    THE SIGN OF
  TRUE WORSHIP       "Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken
                   than the fat of rams" (1 Sam. 15:22). (Compare verse 23; Matt.
                   7:21-23.)

                     "The faith in Christ which saves the soul is not what it is
                   represented to be by many. 'Believe, believe,' is their cry; 'only
                   believe in Christ, and you will be saved. It is all you have to do.'
                   While true faith trusts wholly in Christ for salvation, it will lead to
                   perfect conformity to the law of God. Faith is manifested by
                   works. And the apostle John declares, 'He that saith, I know him,
                   and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar.' "—Ellen G. White
                   Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1073.

                    By what sign can we know that one truly worships "him that
                   made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of
                   waters"? (See Ex. 31:16, 17; 20:8-11; Eze. 20:12, 20.)

                      " 'The importance of the Sabbath as the memorial of creation
                   is that it keeps ever present the true reason why worship is due
                   to God'—because He is the Creator, and we are His creatures.
                   'The Sabbath therefore lies at the very foundation of divine
                   worship, for it teaches this great truth in the most impressive
                   manner, and no other institution does this. The true ground of
                   divine worship, not of that on the seventh day merely, but of all
                   worship, is found in the distinction between the Creator and His
                   creatures. This great fact can never become obsolete, and must
                   never be forgotten.'—J. N. Andrews, History of the Sabbath,
                   chapter 27."—The Great Controversy, pp. 437, 438.

THINK IT THROUGH     "What shall I do to inherit eternal life?"

                      This is the question asked by the rich young ruler. The Mas-
                   ter's response left no doubt: "If thou wilt enter into life, keep the
                   commandments" (Matt. 19:17). "Obedience is the test of disci-
                   pleship. It is the keeping of the commandments that proves the
                   sincerity of our professions of love. When the doctrine we ac-
                   cept kills sin in the heart, purifies the soul from defilement,
                   bears fruit unto holiness, we may know that it is the truth of God.
                   When benevolence, kindness, tenderheartedness, sympathy,
                   are manifest in our lives; when the joy of right doing is in our
                   hearts; when we exalt Christ, and not self, we may know that our
                   faith is of the right order. 'Hereby we do know that we know Him,
                   if we keep His commandments.' 1 John 2:3."—Thoughts From

the everlasting gospel. At first it may
appear to be a simple condemnation
of the religious world in the time of the
end. However, when considered in
connection with the message of
Revelation 18—a repetition of the
second angel's message to be
proclaimed just before the end of
probation—it unfolds as the ultimate
call of divine mercy. Once again God
clearly shows that He does not wish
the death of the sinner, but rather that
"the wicked turn from his way and
live" (Eze. 33:11). Or, as the apostle
Paul expressed it, "God, our Saviour
... will have all men to be saved, and
to come unto the knowledge of
the truth" (1 Tim. 2:3, 4).

essential for God to lay His finger on       DAILY HIGHLIGHTS

      SECOND ANGEL       "There followed another angel" (Rev. 14:8).

                        meanings in this text. In point of time the second angel follows
                        the first, but it is also true that the first angel continues his
                        ministry when the second angel joins him. In this sense the
                        second angel's message accompanies that of the first."—

                           What historical explanation is given us concerning the
                        preaching of the second angel's message? "The second
                        angel's message of Revelation 14 was first preached in the
                        summer of 1844, and it then had a more direct application to the
                        churches of the United States, where the warning of the judg-
                        ment had been most widely proclaimed and most generally
                        rejected, and where the declension in the churches had been
                        most rapid. But the message of the second angel did not reach
                        its complete fulfillment in 1844. The churches then experienced
                        a moral fall, in consequence of their refusal of the light of the ,
                        advent message; but that fall was not complete. As they have
                        continued to reject the special truths for this time they have
                        fallen lower and lower. Not yet, however, can it be said that
                        'Babylon is fallen, ... because she made all nations drink of the
                        wine of the wrath of her fornication.'
                           "The Bible declares that before the coming of the Lord, Satan
                       will work 'with all power and signs and lying wonders, and with
                       all deceivableness of unrighteousness;' and they that 'received
                       not the love of the truth, that they might be saved,' will be left to
                       receive 'strong delusion, that they should believe a lie.' 2 Thes-
                       salonians 2:9-11. Not until this condition shall be reached, and
                       the union of the church with the world shall be fully ac-
                       complished throughout Christendom, will the fall of Babylon be
                       complete. The change is a progressive one, and the perfect
                       fulfillment of Revelation 14:8 is yet future."—The Great Con-

Come Out of Babylon, My People                LESSON 10                 ❑   Monday
                                                                             June 2
           Part 2     What solemn declaration is made by the second angel?
       BABYLON
      THE GREAT       "Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city" (Rev. 14:8).

                       The city of Babylon was originally founded by Nimrod (Gen.
                    10:10; 11:1-9) and reached the zenith of its glory under the reign
                    of Nebuchadnezzar during the time of Daniel. At the time that
                    John was writing the Revelation the city lay in ruins; therefore,
                    this text cannot apply to the historical city.
                       In Revelation the name "Babylon" is used figuratively. It is
                    first mentioned in the message of the second angel. It is interest-
                    ing to note that Babylon is mentioned six times in the Revelation
                    (chap. 14:8; 16:19; 17:5; 18:2, 10, 21) and that six is the symbolic
                    number of the city, and the number used in worship in ancient
                    Babylon.
                       "During the early Christian centuries the cryptic designation
                    Babylon for the city and empire of Rome appears commonly in
                    both Jewish and Christian literature. . . .
                       "Babylon, both literal and mystical, has thus long been rec-
                    ognized as the traditional enemy of God's truth and people. As
                    used in the Revelation the name is symbolic of all apostate
                    religious organizations and their leadership, from antiquity
                    down to the close of time."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p.
                    830.

                       What adjective qualifies the name "Babylon" whenever it is
                    mentioned in the Revelation? What meaning must one at-
                    tribute to it? Rev. 14:8; 16:19; 17:5; 18:2, 10, 21.

                      The adjective "great" fits perfectly what Babylon represents,
                    the example par excellence of a powerful city ruling the world
                    and hostile to God. Her grandeur was built on negative values;
                    great was her sin. (See Rev. 18:5.)
                      In both the Old and the New Testaments, Babylon is consis-
                    tently in opposition to Jerusalem. While the former is symbolic
                    of self-glory and false worship, the latter symbolizes the glory of
                    God and divine worship. The first means "confusion"; the sec-
                    ond "peace." In Revelation mystical Babylon is called "the
                    great whore" (Rev. 17:1), whereas Jerusalem is described as "a
                    bride adorned for her husband" (chap. 21:2).

THINK IT THROUGH      To what degree have I made my choice between the two
                    symbolic cities, Babylon and Jerusalem?

                      "By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place
                    which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; ... For
                    he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and
                    maker is God" (Heb. 11:8-10).

                    "The woman which thou sawest is that great city, which
                  reigneth over the kings of the earth" (Rev. 17:18). Compare
                  verses 1-6, 15.)
                      "In Revelation 17 Babylon is represented as a woman—a
                   figure which is used in the Bible as the symbol of a church, a
                   virtuous woman representing a pure church, a vile woman an
                   apostate church. . . .
                        . .. The power that for so many centuries maintained des-
                   potic sway over the monarchs of Christendom is Rome. The
                   purple and scarlet color, the gold and precious stones and
                   pearls, vividly picture the magnificence and more than kingly
                   pomp affected by the haughty see of Rome. And no other power
                   could be so truly declared 'drunken with the blood of the saints'
                   as that church which has so cruelly persecuted the followers of
                   Christ. Babylon is also charged with the sin of unlawful connec-
                   tion with 'the kings of the earth.' It was by departure from the
                   Lord, and alliance with the heathen, that the Jewish church
                   became a harlot; and Rome, corrupting herself in like manner
                   by seeking the support of worldly powers, receives a like con-
                   demnation.
                      "Babylon is said to be 'the mother of harlots.' By her
                   daughters must be symbolized churches that cling to her doc-
                   trines and traditions, and follow her example of sacrificing the
                   truth and the approval of God, in order to form an unlawful
                   alliance with the world."—The Great Controversy, pp. 381-383.
                     To what precisely does the second angel's message announc-
                   ing the fall of Babylon apply? "The message of Revelation 14,
                   announcing the fall of Babylon must apply to religious bodies
                   that were once pure and have become corrupt. Since this mes-
                   sage follows the warning of the judgment, it must be given in the
                   last days; therefore it cannot refer to the Roman Church alone,
                   for that church has been in a fallen condition for many cen-
                   turies. . . .
                     "Many of the Protestant churches are following Rome's
                   example of iniquitous connection with 'the kings of the
                   earth'—the state churches, by their relation to secular govern-
                   ments; and other denominations, by seeking the favor of the
                   world. And the term 'Babylon'—confusion—may be appro-
                   priately applied to these bodies, all professing to derive their
                   doctrines from the Bible, yet divided into almost innumerable
                   sects."—The Great Controversy, p. 383.

  BABYLON'S SIN
                     "She made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her
                   fornication" (Rev. 14:8).
                      "This cup of intoxication which she presents to the world
                   represents the false doctrines that she has accepted as the
                   result of her unlawful connection with the great ones of the
                   earth. Friendship with the world corrupts her faith, and in her
                   turn she exerts a corrupting influence upon the world by teach-
                   ing dottrines which are opposed to the plainest statements of
                   Holy Writ."—The Great Controversy, p. 388.
                      "This wine of error is made up of false doctrines, such as the
                   natural immortality of the soul, the eternal torment of the
                   wicked, the denial of the pre-existence of Christ. prior to His
                   birth in Bethlehem, and advocating and exalting the first day of
                   the week above God's holy and sanctified day. These and
                   kindred errors are presented to the world by the various
                   churches."—Testimonies to Ministers, pp. 61, 62.

                     What figures are used of Babylon when she came to the end
                   of her moral degradation? Rev. 18:2, 3.

                      "A terrible condition of the religious world is here described.
                   With every rejection of truth the minds of the people will be-
                   come darker, their hearts more stubborn, until they are en-
                   trenched in an infidel hardihood. . . . As the teachings of
                   spiritualism are accepted by the churches, the restraint im-
                   posed upon the carnal heart is removed, and the profession of
                   religion will become a cloak to conceal the basest iniquity. A
                   belief in spiritual manifestations opens the door to seducing
                   spirits and doctrines of devils, and thus the influence of evil
                   angels will be felt in the churches."—The Great Controversy,
                   pp. 603, 604.
                      "The sins of the popular churches are whitewashed over.
                   Many of the members indulge in the grossest vices and are
                   steeped in iniquity. Babylon is fallen and has become the cage
                   of every foul and hateful bird! The most revolting sins of the age
                   find shelter beneath the cloak of Christianity."—Testimonies,

THINK IT THROUGH     To what degree have I avoided worldly influences?
                      "Our position in the world is not what it should be. We are far
                   from where we should have been had our Christian experience
                   been in harmony with the light and the opportunities given us.

                    heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with
                    his glory" (Rev. 18:1).

                       "Power. Gr. exousia, 'authority.' . . . This angel comes forth
                    from the throne room of the universe, commissioned to pro-

                    light of saving truth."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p.860.

                      In what special manner does God in mercy have the second
                    angel's message repeated? Rev. 18:2.

                      "This scripture [Rev. 18:1,2,4] points forward to a time when
                    the announcement of the fall of Babylon, as made by the second
                    angel of Revelation 14 (verse 8), is to be repeated, with the
                    additional mention of the corruptions which have been entering
                    the various organizations that constitute Babylon, since that
                    message was first given, in the summer of 1844."— The Great

                       What does God demand that we be for all the world to be
                    lighted? Matt. 5:14-16.

                      This text is referred to 264 times in the writings of Ellen White.
                    Few other scriptures did she mention so often, confirming the
                    importance that it should have in our thinking.

THINK IT THROUGH      How can I prepare for participation in God's final work?

                      "As the time comes for it [message of the third angel] to be
                    given with greatest power, the Lord will work through humble
                    instruments, leading the minds of those who consecrate them-
                    selves to His service. The laborers will be qualified rather by the
                    unction of His Spirit than by the training of literary institutions.
                    Men of faith and prayer will be constrained to go forth with holy
                    zeal, declaring the words which God gives them. The sins of
                    Babylon will be open.... By these solemn warnings the people
                    will be stirred. Thousands upon thousands will listen who have
                    never heard words like these."—The Great Controversy, p.606.

Come Out of Babylon, My People                LESSON 10                   ❑    Friday
                                                                              June 6
           Part 6     To whom is God's last appeal particularly addressed?
   THE LAST CALL
                      "I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of
                    her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that
                    ye receive not of her plagues" (Rev. 18:4).

                       "God still has a people in Babylon; and before the visitation of
                    His judgments these faithful ones must be called out, that they
                    partake not of her sins and 'receive not of her plagues.' Hence
                    the movement symbolized by the angel coming down from
                    heaven, lightening the earth with his glory and crying mightily
                    with a strong voice, announcing the sins of Babylon. In connec-
                    tion with his message the call is heard, 'Come out of her, My
                    people.' These announcements, uniting with the third angel's
                    message, constitute the final warning to be given to the inhabit-
                    ants of the earth."—The Great Controversy, p. 604.

                      At a time when confusion and iniquity reign in the world,
                    what does the Lord demand of His people? Phil. 2:14-16;
                    1 Peter 2.9.

                      "We are living in the last days of this earth's history, in an age
                    of sin and corruption, and like Noah we are to so live that we
                    shall be a pleasure to God, showing forth the praises of Him
                    'who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light'
                    (1 Peter 2:9)."—Selected Messages, bk. 1, p. 90.
                      "God requires His people to shine as lights in the world. It is
                    not merely the ministers who are required to do this, but every
                    disciple of Christ. Their conversation should be heavenly. And
                    while they enjoy communion with God they will wish to have
                    intercourse with their fellow men in order to express by their
                    words and acts the love of God which animates their hearts."—

                    in carrying out the work of God?

                       "The prophecies in the eighteenth of Revelation will soon be
                    fulfilled. During the proclamation of the third angel's message,
                    'another angel' is to 'come down from heaven, having great
                    power,' and the earth is to be 'lightened with his glory.' The
                    Spirit of the Lord will so graciously bless consecrated human
                    instrumentalities that men, women, and children will open their
                    lips in praise and thanksgiving, filling the earth with the knowl-
                    edge of God, and with His unsurpassed glory, as the waters
                    cover the sea."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Com-

the presence of the Lamb" (Rev. 14:9,      390.

  Through the first angel's message
the Lord invites "them that dwell on
the earth, . . . every nation, and
kindred, and tongue, and people," to
"fear God, and give glory to him; for
the hour of his judgment is come"
(verses 6, 7). Then, after announcing
the fall of Babylon by the proclamation
of the second angel's message, the
Lord calls those of His children who
are still scattered, again inviting them
to come out of the great city of
perdition in order not to participate in
her sins or have a part in her plagues.

                                                                          June 8
           Part 1     What is told us about the third angel, and what do we know
       THE THIRD    about the time of his operation?
          ANGEL
                      "The third angel followed them saying with a loud voice"
                    (Rev. 14:9).
                       The Greek word translated "followed" here means that the
                    third angel came after the first and the second angels and then
                    accompanied them. Thus the three angels carry on their work
                    together until the end.
                       "When we began to present the light on the Sabbath ques-
                    tion, we had no clearly defined idea of the third angel's message
                    of Revelation 14:9-12. The burden of our testimony as we came
                    before the people was that the great second advent movement
                    was of God, that the first and second messages had gone forth,
                    and that the third was to be given. We saw that the third mes-
                    sage closed with the words: 'Here is the patience of the saints:
                    here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith
                    of Jesus.' And we as clearly saw as we now see that these
                    prophetic words suggested a Sabbath reform; but as to what
                    the worship of the beast mentioned in the message was, or what
                    the image and the mark of the beast were, we had no defined
                    position.
                       "God by His Holy Spirit let light shine forth upon His servants,
                    and the subject gradually opened to their minds. It required
                    much study and anxious care to search it out, link after link. By
                    care, anxiety, and incessant labor has the work moved on until
                    the great truths of .our message, a clear, connected, perfect
                    whole, have been given to the world."—Testimonies, vol. 1, pp.
                    78, 79.
                       The first and the third angels' messages are to be proclaimed
                    "with a loud voice." This indicates that they are to be given in a
                    way that all the world will hear. This type of communication also
                    emphasizes the importance of the messages to be proclaimed.
                       "The message of the third angel is to prepare a people to
                    stand in these days of peril. It is to be proclaimed with a loud
                    voice and is to accomplish a work which few realize."—

                    prophecy?

                    place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:
                    knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any
                    private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old time by
                    the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved
                    by the Holy Ghost" (2 Peter 1:19-21).

           Part 2     What earthly power is implicated with the beast spoken of in
     THE BEAST      the third angel's message?
  AND HIS IMAGE
                      "If any man worship the beast and his image" (Rev. 14:9).
                    (See also Rev. 13:2-8.)

                      "In chapter 13 (verses 1-10) is described another beast, ... to
                    which the dragon gave 'his power, and his seat, and great
                    authority.' This symbol, as most Protestants have believed, rep-
                    resents the papacy, which succeeded to the power and seat and
                    authority once held by the ancient Roman empire. . . .
                      " ... This period, as stated in preceding chapters, began with
                    the supremacy of the papacy, A.D. 538, and terminated in 1798.
                    At that time the pope was made captive by the French army, the
                    papal power received its deadly wound, and the prediction was
                    fulfilled, 'He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity.' "
                    —The Great Controversy, p. 439.
                       "After this, says the prophet, 'his deadly wound was healed:
                    and all the world wondered after the beast.' Paul states plainly
                    that the 'man of sin' will continue until the second advent.
                    2 Thessalonians 2:3-8. To the very close of time he will carry
                    forward the work of deception. And the revelator declares, also
                    referring to the papacy: 'All that dwell upon the earth shall
                    worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life.'
                    Revelation 13:8."—The Great Controversy, p. 579.

                     What is the image to the beast spoken of in the third angel's
                    message? Rev. 14:9; 13:12-17.

                       "By this first beast is represented the Roman Church, an
                    ecclesiastical body clothed with civil power, having authority to
                    punish all dissenters. The image to the beast represents another
                    religious body clothed with similar powers. The formation of
                    this image is the work of that beast whose peaceful rise and mild
                    professions render it so striking a symbol of the United States.
                    Here is to be found an image of the Papacy. When the churches
                    of our land, uniting upon such points of faith as are held by them
                    in common, shall influence the State to enforce their decrees
                    and sustain their institutions, then will Protestant America have
                    formed an image of the Roman hierarchy."—The Story of Re-

THINK IT THROUGH      It is time to understand that the fight of faith, soon to come,
                    will be something different from doctrinal disputes or from the
                    struggle against the carnal man. (Read Eph. 6:10-12.)

              Part 3     What mark will distinguish those who worship the beast and
       THE MARK OF     his image just before the end of time?
          THE BEAST
       AND THE SEAL      "If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive
             OF GOD    his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of
                       the wine of the wrath of God" (Rev. 14:9,10). (Compare 13:16,
                       17.)

                          "Adventist interpreters understand this mark to be not a lit-
                       eral brand but some sign of allegiance that identified the bearer
                       as loyal to the power represented by the beast. The controversy
                       at that time will center on the law of God, and particularly on the
                       fourth command. . . . Hence the observance of Sunday will
                       constitute such a sign, but only at the time when the beast's
                       power will be revived and Sunday observance becomes a matter
                       of compliance with civil law. Adventists hold that simultaneously
                       the third angel's message will warn against the reception of the
                       mark (ch. 14:9-11). This message, swelling into a loud cry (ch.
                       18:1-4), will enlighten men as to the issues involved. When the
                       issues are thus clearly before them, and men nevertheless
                       choose to support an institution of the beast, knowing it to be in
                       direct opposition to the command of God, they thereby show
                       their allegiance to the power and receive the mark of the
                       beast."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 822.

                        In contradistinction to the mark of the beast, what sign will
                       God's children receive? Rev. 7:3; 2 Cor. 1:22.

                           "As in ancient times a seal on an object testified to its owner-
                       ship, so the seal of God upon His people proclaims that He has

                       pure mark of truth,' the 'mark' of His 'approval' (3T 267). It
                       attests 'likeness to Christ in character' [EGW RH May 5, 1895].

                       the passport through the gates of the Holy City. But there are

The Third Angel's Message           LESSON 11                    ❑ Wednesday
                                                                     June 11
          Part 4    The worship of the beast and his image implies hostility to
       TRUE AND    God's law. What result naturally follows this open hostility?
  FALSE WORSHIP
                     "They have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast
                   and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his
                   name" (Rev. 14:11).

                      "When Sunday observance shall be enforced by law, and the
                   world shall be enlightened concerning the obligation of the true
                   Sabbath, then whoever shall transgress the command of God,
                   to obey a precept which has no higher authority than that of
                   Rome, will thereby honor popery above God. He is paying hom-
                   age to Rome and to the power which enforces the institution
                   ordained by Rome. He is worshiping the beast and his image. As
                   men then reject the institution which God has declared to be the
                   sign of His authority, and honor in its stead that which Rome has
                   chosen as the token of her supremacy, they will thereby accept
                   the sign of allegiance to Rome—The mark of the beast.' And it is
                   not until the issue is thus plainly set before the people, and they
                   are brought to choose between the commandments of God and
                   the commandments of men, that those who continue in trans-
                   gression will receive 'the mark of the beast.' "—The Great Con-
                   troversy, p. 449.

                     What sign distinguishes those who worship the true God?
                   Isa. 56:1, 2, 6, 7.

                      "While the worshipers of God will be especially distinguished
                   by their regard for the fourth commandment—since this is the
                   sign of His creative power and the witness to His claim upon
                   man's reverence and homage,—the worshipers of the beast will
                   be distinguished by their efforts to tear down the Creator's
                    memorial, to exalt the institution of Rome."—The Great Con-
                   troversy, p. 446.

THINK IT THROUGH     What are you doing to prepare for that final test?

                     "Those who are uniting with the world are receiving the
                   worldly mold and preparing for the mark of the beast. Those
                   who are distrustful of self, who are humbling themselves before
                   God and purifying their souls by obeying the truth—these are
                   receiving the heavenly mold and preparing for the seal of God in
                   their foreheads. When the decree goes forth and the stamp is
                   impressed, their character will remain pure and spotless for
                   eternity.
                     "Now is the time to prepare."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 216.

        THE TIME OF    bolized by the image to the beast at the time of the final crisis?
          THE FINAL
              CRISIS     "He causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free
                       and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their
                       foreheads: and that no man might buy or sell, save he that had
                       the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name"
                       (Rev. 13:16, 17).

                          "A time is coming when the law of God is, in a special sense,
                       to be made void in our land. The rulers of our nation will, by
                       legislative enactments, enforce the Sunday law, and thus God's
                       people be brought into great peril. When our nation, in its
                       legislative councils, shall enact laws to bind the consciences of
                       men in regard to their religious privileges, enforcing Sunday
                       observance, and bringing oppressive power to bear against
                       those who keep the seventh-day Sabbath, the law of God will, to
                       all intents and purposes, be made void in our land; and national
                       apostasy will be followed by national ruin."—Ellen G. White

                         What extreme measure will be taken as regards those who
                       refuse to receive the mark of the beast or to worship the image
                       to the beast? Rev. 13:15.

                          "In the issue of the conflict all Christendom will be divided
                       into two great classes, those who keep the commandments of
                       God and the faith of Jesus, and those who worship the beast and
                       his image, and receive his mark."—Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 16.
                          "This is the story of the ages. Legislation in matters of religion
                       has ever been followed by persecution. It was so during the
                       Middle Ages: witness the massacre of the Waldenses and
                       others, at the hands of the civil power, to be sure, but prompted
                       by the dominant church of the day. In its attempt to make all
                       earth's inhabitants give allegiance to the first beast . . . the
                       second beast will issue a decree threatening with death all who

          Part 6   What does the apostle Paul teach concerning the sufferings
   RECOMPENSE of this present life?
AND PUNISHMENT
                   "I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not
                 worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed
                 in us" (Rom. 8:18). (Compare 2 Cor. 4:17, 18.)

                      "The anticipation of this future glory should sustain Chris-
                   tians in their afflictions here below. The sufferings may seem
                   great, but they are 'light' compared with that 'eternal weight of
                   glory' which the afflictions are working out (2 Cor. 4:17). They
                   are for only a moment, but the glory will be eternal. They will
                   soon pass away, but the glory will never dim or diminish forever
                   and ever (1 Peter 1:14)."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p.
                   569.

                     What terrible future awaits those who refuse to listen to the
                   solemn message of the third angel? Rev. 14:10, 11.

                      When the time of probation is past, God's judgments will be
                   poured out without mercy. The torments mentioned will proba-
                   bly be twofold: first, during the plagues when the enemies of
                   God's law will have "no rest day nor night" (verse 11), the end of
                   which will be the first death at the time of the glorious appearing
                   of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ (Rev. 19:19-21); and, sec-
                   ond, the final destruction at the time of the "second death"
                   (Rev. 20:14).
                      "The figure of the smoke ascending forever is doubtless
                   drawn from Isa. 34:10, where the desolation of Edom is de-
                   scribed. That the ancient prophet did not envision unending
                   fires is seen from the fact that following the conflagration,
                   concerning which he says, 'The smoke thereof shall go up for
                   ever,' the country becomes a desolate waste inhabited by wild
                   beasts (vs. 10-15). The figure denotes complete destruction."
                   Q.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 832.
                      "The theory of eternal torment is one of the false doctrines
                   that constitute the wine of the abomination of Babylon."—The
                   Great Controversy, p. 536.

THINK IT THROUGH     What will be my position during the time of crisis?

                      "Those who exercise but little faith now, are in the greatest
                   danger of falling under the power of satanic delusions and the
                   decree to compel the conscience. And even if they endure the
                   test they will be plunged into deeper distress and anguish in the
                   time of trouble, because they have never made it a habit to trust
                   in God. The lessons of faith which they have neglected they will
                   be forced to learn under a terrible pressure of discouragement."

              Part 1     What Christian virtue does the angel mention first? Why?
       THE PATIENCE
      OF THE SAINTS      "Here is the patience of the saints" (Rev. 14:12).

                          "Here the translation 'steadfast endurance' would be a more
                       suitable rendering. The context calls attention to the fearful
                       struggle with the beast and his image. Every attempt will be
                       made to force the remnant to join the movement promoted by
                       the second beast, including the threat of boycott and death.
                       (Rev. 13:11-17). At the same time Satan will work with all 'de-
                       ceivableness of unrighteousness' (2 Thess. 2:10; cf. Matt.
                       24:24), making it appear that the power of God is manifest in the
                       movement. Through all this the faithful remnant steadfastly
                       endure and maintain their integrity. Their steadfastness merits
                       special commendation."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p.
                       832.

                        What part does endurance play in the work of salvation?
                       Matt. 24:9-13; Heb. 10:35-39.

                          In these texts Jesus places the endurance of the saints in its
                        proper relation to the terrible conditions prevalent in the last
                        days—affliction, deception, iniquity, and general apostasy—
                        obstacles set up by the enemy to cause the saints to stumble
                       and fall. The children of God will meet every temptation and
                       emerge victorious. Salvation is promised only to those who
                       endure to the end, remain faithful in spite of general apostasy,
                        and preserve their purity in a rising flood of iniquity.
                          "That this admonition [Heb. 10:35-39] is addressed to the
                        church in the last days is evident from the words pointing to the
                       nearness of the Lord's coming: 'For yet a little while, and He that
                       shall come will come and will not tarry.' ... The instruction here
                       given is especially adapted to the experience of Adventists at
                       this time. The people here addressed were in danger of making
                       shipwreck of faith.... Their only safe course was to cherish the
                       light which they had already received of God, hold fast to His
                       promises, and continue to search the Scriptures, and patiently
                       wait and watch to receive further light."—The Great Con-

               Part 2     What characteristics identify those who accept the third
THE COMMANDMENTS        angel's message?
    OF GOD AND THE
     FAITH OF JESUS       "Here are they that keep the commandments of God, and
                        the faith of Jesus" (Rev. 14:12).

                           "Keep the commandments of God. This statement is particu-
                        larly significant in its context. Led captive by Satan's delusions,
                        the world will bow to the beast and its image, and carry out its
                        dictates and decrees.... The saints, on the other hand, refuse to
                        comply with its demands. . . In this dark hour the children of
                        God will cling to the Bible and refuse to give homage to any
                        power besides Christ. Among the many identifying features that
                        might have been mentioned, the prophet was directed to point
                        out two predominant ones, the keeping of the commandments
                        of God and of the faith of Jesus."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary,
                        vol. 7, pp. 832, 833.
                           Why should the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus
                        be the distinctive features of the remnant church? The patience
                        of the saints is characterized by the keeping of the command-
                        ments of God and by the faith of Jesus because these two
                        requirements are essential to Christian living. A second reason
                        for emphasizing these essential features is that false teaching
                        has long placed emphasis on salvation by works without faith,
                        and on faith without works.
                           Through the third angel's message, the Lord desires to rees-
                        tablish the truth, and it falls to the church of the remnant to
                        proclaim it by word and deed. The Christian religion has always
                        been a matter of both faith and obedience. Luke reports, "A
                        great company of the priests were obedient to the faith" (Acts
                        6:7). And speaking of his work, Paul said that his goal was to
                         lead to "obedience to the faith among all nations" (Rom. 1:5).
                           "The enemy has ever labored to disconnect the law and the
                         gospel. They go hand in hand. . . .
                           "The law of Jehovah is the tree, the gospel is the fragrant
                         blossoms and fruit which it bears."—Ellen G. White Comments,
                        S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1073.
                           "It is only as the law of God is restored to its rightful position
                         that there can be a revival of primitive faith and godliness
                         among His professed people."—The Great Controversy, p. 478.

         THE FOURTH mandments of God?
      COMMANDMENT
                       "Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing,
                     but the keeping of the commandments of God" (1 Cor. 7:19).
                       "He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his command-
                     ments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him" (1 John 2:4).
                     (Compare ch. 5:2-4.)
                         "By the first angel, men are called upon to 'fear God, and give
                      glory to Him,' and to worship Him as the Creator of the heavens
                      and the earth. In order to do this, they must obey His law. Says
                      the wise man: 'Fear God, and keep His commandments: for this
                      is the whole duty of man.' Ecclesiastes 12:13. Without obedi-
                      ence to His commandments no worship can be pleasing to God.
                      'This is the love of God, that we keep His commandments.' He
                      that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer
                      shall be an abomination.' 1 John 5:3; Proverbs 28:9."—The
                      Great Controversy, p. 436.

                        Of all the Ten Commandments, why do we give so much
                      importance to the fourth? Ex. 31:17; Dan. 7:25.

                         There are at least two essential reasons for giving great im-
                      portance to the fourth commandment: First, observance of the
                      true day of rest in harmony with the law of God is a proof of our
                      fidelity to God's authority as Creator. Second, the fourth com-
                      mandment is the one that the adversary has particularly at-
                      tacked, hoping to be able to "change times and laws."
                          "The seal of God's law is found in the fourth commandment.
                      This only, of all the ten, brings to view both the name and the
                      title of the Lawgiver. It declares Him to be the Creator of the
                      heavens and the earth, and thus shows His claim to reverence
                      and worship above all others. Aside from this precept, there is
                      nothing in the Decalogue to show by whose authority the law is
                      given. When the Sabbath was changed by the papal power, the
                      seal was taken from the law. The disciples of Jesus are called
                      upon to restore it by exalting the Sabbath of the fourth com-
                      mandment to its rightful position as the Creator's memorial and
                      the sign of His authority."—The Great Controversy, p. 452.

                                                                     June 18
          Part 4     What is the role of the law in the work of salvation?
       THE LAW
     AND GRACE       "By the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in
                   his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin" (Rom. 3:20).
                   (Compare ch. 7:7.)
                     "The law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that
                   we might be justified by faith" (Gal. 3:24).

                      "Without the law, men have no just conception of the purity
                   and holiness of God or of their own guilt and uncleanness. They
                   have no true conviction of sin and feel no need of repentance.
                   Not seeing their lost condition as violators of God's law, they do
                   not realize their need of the atoning blood of Christ. The hope of
                   salvation is accepted without a radical change of heart or ref-
                   ormation of life. Thus superficial conversions abound, and mul-
                   titudes are joined to the church who have never been united to
                   Christ."—The Great Controversy, p. 468.

                     How does faith in Jesus complement the work of the law in
                   the salvation of men? Rom. 3:21-26; Gal. 5:5, 6.

                     The knowledge of sin is possible only by the law of God, and
                   justification is obtainable only "by faith in Jesus Christ" (Rom.
                   3:22, RSV). Through the law the sinner is made conscious of his
                   guilt in the sight of God; through faith in Jesus he is freely
                   forgiven.

                     How does genuine faith express itself? James 2:14-26.

                     "The desire for an easy religion that requires no striving, no
                   self-denial, no divorce from the follies of the world, has made
                   the doctrine of faith, and faith only, a popular doctrine; but what
                   saith the word of God? . . .
                     "The testimony of the word of God is against this ensnaring
                   doctrine of faith without works. It is not faith that claims the
                   favor of Heaven without complying with the conditions upon
                   which mercy is to be granted, it is presumption; for genuine
                   faith has its foundation in the promises and provisions of the
                   Scriptures."—The Great Controversy, p. 472.

THINK IT THROUGH    Until now, how have I shown my faith to be genuine? In what
                   ways have I proclaimed the third angel's message?

                      "The message of Christ's righteousness is to sound from one
                   end of the earth to the other to prepare the way of the Lord. This
                   is the glory of God, which closes the work of the third angel."—

            Part 5   What is the basic prerequisite for all claims to be teaching
      TO THE LAW the truth?
      AND TO THE
       TESTIMONY     "To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not accord-

                   8:20). (Compare Luke 16:29-31.)
                      "To the law and to the testimony" has the same meaning as
                   the expression used by Jesus to designate Scripture, "Moses
                   and all the prophets" (Luke 24:27), or that used by Paul, "the law
                   and the prophets" (Rom. 3:21). "Isaiah directs men away from
                   the words and wisdom of devils and men to the revealed wisdom

                      "'To the law and to the testimony.' While conflicting doc-
                   trines and theories abound, the law of God is the one unerring
                   rule by which all opinions, doctrines, and theories are to be
                   tested. Says the prophet: 'If they speak not according to this
                   word, it is because there is no light in them.' "—The Great

                     According to the prophet Isaiah, what particular restoration
                    must repairers of the breach make? Isa. 58:12-14.
                     "This prophecy [Isa. 58:12-14] also applies in our time. The
                   breach was made in the law of God when the Sabbath was
                   changed by the Roman power. But the time has come for that
                   divine institution to be restored. The breach is to be repaired

Repairers of the Breach          LESSON 12                                ❑   Friday
                                                                            June 20
           Part 6     What did the Lord promise through the prophet Malachi
   IN THE SPIRIT    concerning the first and the second advents of Jesus?
     AND POWER
       OF ELIJAH      "Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the com-
                    ing of the great and dreadful day of the Lord" (Mal. 4:5).

                      Even though this prophecy has already been fUlfilled in the
                    person of John the Baptist, the context clearly shows that it will
                    have another fulfillment before "the great and dreadful day of
                    the Lord," "that shall burn as an oven" (Mal. 4:5, 1). "John the
                    Baptist went forth in the spirit and power of Elijah to prepare the
                    way of the Lord:...He was a representative of those living in
                    these last days to whom God has entrusted sacred truths to
                    present before the people to prepare the way for the second
                    appearing of Christ."—Testimonies, vol. 3, pp. 61, 62.

                      What did Malachi state was the work to be accomplished,
                    and what explanation did the angel give Zacharias concern-
                    ing this message? Mal. 4:6; Luke 1:16, 17.

                       The work of John the Baptist, like that of the prophet Elijah,
                    was to lead the sons of Israel back to the Lord their God, "the
                    disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people
                    prepared for the Lord" (Luke 1:17).
                       "The very work accomplished by Elijah and John the Baptist
                    is needed today. In these days of moral corruption and spiritual
                    blindness there is need of voices that will fearlessly proclaim the
                    coming of the Lord to the people of earth. The call of this hour is
                    for men and women who will order their lives as did John and
                    Elijah of old, and who will call upon others to do the same. There
                    is needed a work of earnest reform, not only without the church,
                    but within it as well. God calls upon all who would love and serve
                    Him to go forth 'in the spirit and power of Elijah' (3T 61, 62)."—
                    S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 675.

THINK IT THROUGH      How deep is my concern for the unfinished task before us?

                      "In this time of well-nigh universal apostasy, God calls upon
                    His messengers to proclaim His law in the spirit and power of
                    Elias. As John the Baptist, in preparing a people for Christ's first
                    advent, called their attention to the Ten Commandments, so we
                    are to give, with no uncertain sound, the message: 'Fear God,
                    and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come.'
                    With the earnestness that characterized Elijah the prophet and
                    John the Baptist, we are to strive to prepare the way for Christ's
                    second advent."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible

22:20).                                     but our hope is not to grow dim. If we

the Apocalypse is both a revelation of
God given by Jesus Christ as the
intermediary and one that reveals
Jesus Christ Himself, Him "which is,
and which was, and which is to come"
(Rev. 1:4). Certainly, as Ellen White so
aptly stated, "All revelation to men
comes through Christ, and all centers
in Him."—Ellen G. White Comments,
S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p.
953. This is particularly true in this
marvelous book where we have "the
testimony of Jesus Christ" revealed to
His church and the revelation given by
the "faithful and true witness."
   Like the prophet on Patmos, we now
await the glorious appearing of our
Lord Jesus Christ, as foretold from the     DAILY HIGHLIGHTS

"Behold, He Cometh With Clouds"                     LESSON 13                ❑ Sunday
                                                                              June 22
              Part 1      What is John's description of the coming of the Son of man
        THE SON OF     in glory?
      MAN IN GLORY
                         "I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one
                       sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden
                       crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle" (Rev. 14:14). (Compare
                       1:7; 19:11-16.)

                          The fact that the glorious return of Jesus Christ is to follow
                       immediately after the proclamations of the three angels shows
                       that their messages constitute God's last call, His final warning.
                          In Revelation 1:7 the prophet of Patmos affirmed that "every
                       eye shall see him," even "they also which pierced him." In
                       chapter 14, verses 14 to 18, the reason for His return is evinced:
                       He comes to "reap; for the harvest of earth is ripe," to "gather
                       the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe."
                       Finally, in the vision of chapter 19 Jesus appears with His
                       triumphal retinue as "King of kings, and Lord of lords."

                         In what points do these descriptions of our Lord's return
                       reaffirm the promises made previously? Matt. 24:30, 31; 26:64;
                       Acts 1:9-11.

                          "No human pen can portray the scene; no mortal mind is
                       adequate to conceive its splendor.... [Hab. 3:3, 4 quoted.] As
                       the living cloud comes still nearer, every eye beholds the Prince
                       of life. No crown of thorns now mars that sacred head; but a
                       diadem of glory rests on His holy brow. His countenance out-
                       shines the dazzling brightness of the noonday sun. 'And He hath
                       on His vesture and on His thigh a name written, King of kings,
                       and Lord of lords.' Revelation 19:16."--The Great Controversy,
                       p. 641.

THINK IT THROUGH        Is the promise of our Lord's return the "blessed hope" for
                       me personally?

                          "We are pilgrims and strangers who are waiting, hoping, and
                       praying for that blessed hope, the glorious appearing of our
                       Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. If we believe this and bring it into
                       our practical life, what vigorous action would this faith and
                       hope inspire; what fervent love one for another; what careful
                       holy living for the glory of God; and in our respect for the
                       recompense of the reward, what distinct lines of demarcation
                       would be evidenced between us and the world."—Evangelism,

    THE HARVEST upon the cloud having "in his hand a sharp sickle"?
    OF THE EARTH
                     "Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come for thee
                   to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe. And he that sat on
                   the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth; and the earth was
                   reaped" (Rev. 14:15, 16).

                       "Verses 15-20 [of Revelation 14] describe the great harvest at
                    the end of all things. The harvest comprehends two distinctive
                    events. One is described in vs. 16, 17, and the other in vs. 18-20.
                    The first refers to the gathering of the righteous, represented
                    here by ripened grain, as shown in the Greek by the word
                    translated 'ripe.' The second refers to the wicked, represented
                    by the clusters of 'fully ripe' grapes."—S.D.A. Bible Commen-
                    tary, vol. 7, p. 834.

                      What figure did Jesus use to illustrate• the harvest of the
                    world? What did He warn would happen at that time? Matt.
                    13:24-30, 36-43.

                      " 'The field,' Christ said, 'is the world.' But we must under-
                    stand this as signifying the church of Christ in the world. The
                    parable is a description of that which pertains to the kingdom of
                    God, His work of salvation of men; and this work is ac-
                    complished through the church. True, the Holy Spirit has gone
                    out into all the world; everywhere it is moving upon the hearts of
                    men; but it is in the church that we are to grow and ripen for the
                    garner of God."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 70.

                       What will the Lord do before His return to cause the harvest
                     to ripen? Joel 2:23, 28, 32.

                        "If this prophecy of Joel met a partial fulfillment in the days of
                     the apostles [Acts 2:17,18], we are living in a time when it is to be
                     even more evidently manifest to the people of God."—Ellen G.

                        "Near the close of earth's harvest, a special bestowal of
                     spiritual grace is promised to prepare the church for the coming
                     of the Son of man. This outpouring of the Spirit is likened to the
                     falling of the latter rain; and it is for this added power that
                     Christians are to send their petitions to the Lord of the harvest,
                     'in the time of the latter rain.' "—The Acts of the Apostles, p.55.

             Part 3     Besides the harvesting of ripened grain, what other event is
      THE VINTAGE     to take place at the time of Christ's return?

                        "Another angel came out from the altar, which had power
                      over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp
                      sickle, saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clus-
                      ters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe" (Rev.
                      14:18).

                         In former times there were two harvests in Israel, that of
                      ripened grains in late spring, and the vintage in the fall when the
                      grapes were ripe on the vines. Jesus is pictured here using a
                      sickle for both crops. Here the two harvests are recalled to
                      represent, on the one hand, the gathering of the redeemed
                      whom God will take to His celestial granary and, on the other,
                      the sinners who will be cast "into the great winepress of the
                      wrath of God" (v. 19).

                        Then what is the significance of the vintage? Rev. 14:19, 20;
                      Joel 3:13, 14.

                         Whereas the harvest is entrusted to Him who is seated upon
                      the clouds—the Son of man—it is to an angel that the negative
                      work of condemnation is ascribed, represented by the vintage.
                      The angel who gives the order to gather the grapes has power
                      over the fire, by which the judgments of God will be poured out
                      on the earth. He comes out from the altar, under which are
                      found "the souls of them that were slain for the word of God,
                      and for the testimony which they held," who question impa-
                      tiently, "How long, 0 Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge
                      and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?" (Rev.
                      6:9, 10).
                         Whereas details of the harvest of ripened grain can hardly be
                      described more briefly, those given of the vintage make one
                      shudder. This is because these awesome particulars must serve
                      as a forceful warning to them who have not yet taken the mes-
                      sages of the three angels seriously.

                        With what figures did Jesus describe this same scene in His
                      parables? Matt. 13:41, 42, 47-50.

THINK IT THROUGH        Everyone will reap exactly what he has sown.

                        "Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man
                      soweth, that shall he also reap. For he that soweth to his flesh
                      shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the
                      Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting" (Gal. 6:7, 8).

          Part 4     Where did John see gathered those who were victorious
     ON THE SEA    over the beast and his image?
      OF GLASS
                     "I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them
                   that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image,
                   and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on
                   the sea of glass, having the harps of God" (Rev. 15:2).

                      "Christ's true disciples follow Him through sore conflicts,
                   enduring self-denial and experiencing bitter disappointment;
                   but this teaches them the guilt and woe of sin, and they are led to
                   look upon it with abhorrence. Partakers of Christ's sufferings,
                   they are destined to be partakers of His glory. In holy vision the
                   prophet saw the ultimate triumph of God's remnant church....
                      " . . The vision of the prophet pictures them as standing on
                   Mount Zion, girt for holy service, clothed in white linen, which is
                   the righteousness of the saints. But all who follow the Lamb in
                   heaven must first have followed Him on earth, not fretfully or
                   capriciously, but in trustful, loving, willing obedience, as the
                   flock follows the shepherd."—The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 590,
                   591

                     Who are they who stand before the throne and before the
                   Lamb? From where do they come? Rev. 7:13-15.

                     "The heirs of God have come from garrets, from hovels, from
                   dungeons, from scaffolds, from mountains, from deserts, from
                   the caves of the earth, from the caverns of the sea. On earth they
                   were 'destitute, afflicted, tormented.' ... They stand before the
                   throne clad in richer robes than the most honored of the earth
                   have ever worn. They are crowned with diadems more glorious
                   than were ever placed upon the brow of earthly monarchs."—
                   The Great Controversy, p. 650.

                     For what reason are the redeemed of earth clad in white
                   robes before the throne and before the Lamb? Rev. 7:14.

                      "The reason for the purity of the robes is given. The saints are
                   triumphant, not on their own account, but because of the vic-
                   tory won by Christ on Calvary. . . . The battle is against sin;
                   righteousness is the victory; Christ's righteousness has won the
                   victory; and upon accepting His righteousness sinners become
                   both righteous and victorious."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary,
                   vol. 7, p. 785.
                      "Those whom the Lamb shall lead by the fountains of living
                   waters, and from whose eyes He shall wipe away all tears, will be

              Part 5     What is the title of the song to be sung by the redeemed of
       THE SONG OF     earth? Why is it appropriate?
      THE REDEEMED
                         "They sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the
                       song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous are thy works,
                       Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of
                       saints" (Rev. 15:3). (See also ch. 14:3.)

                          "The experience is of such a personal nature that only those
                       who pass through it can appreciate its significance. To them the
                       song is a treasured and comprehensive summation of the ex-
                       periences through which they have passed in the closing stages
                       of the conflict between good and evil."—S.D.A. Bible Commen-
                       tary, vol. 7, p. 826.
                         "Song of Moses. This is undoubtedly a reference to the song
                       of deliverance after Israel crossed the Red Sea (Ex. 15:1-21).
                       That song celebrated the deliverance from Egyptian oppres-
                       sion; the new song, deliverance from the tyranny of 'Babylon
                       the great' (Rev. 17:5). . . .
                         "The deliverance of the saints was wrought by Christ, the
                       Lamb of God ... , and it is but natural that He should be adored
                       and exalted in the song of deliverance."—S.D.A. Bible Com-
                       mentary, vol. 7, p. 836.

                         What are the words of the song of Moses and the Lamb?
                       Rev. 15:3, 4.

                          "God carries with Him the sympathy and approval of the
                       whole universe as step by step His great plan advances to its
                       complete fulfillment. . . . It will be seen that all who have for-
                       saken the divine precepts have placed themselves on the side of
                       Satan, in warfare against Christ. When the prince of this world
                       shall be judged, and all who have united with him shall share his
                       fate, the whole universe as witnesses to the sentence will de-
                       clare, 'Just and true are Thy ways, Thou King of saints.' Revela-

THINK IT THROUGH         "Then shall I know even as also I am known" (1 Cor. 13:12).

                          "When the redeemed stand in the presence of God, they will
                       see how shortsighted were their conclusions as to what heaven
                       records as success. As they review their efforts to achieve suc-
                       cess they will see how foolish were their plans, how petty their
                       supposed trials, how unreasonable their doubts. They will see
                       how often they brought failure to their work by not taking God at
                       His word. And one truth will stand out in clear lines: that posi-
                       tion does not prepare a man for entrance into the heavenly
                       courts."—Testimonies, vol. 7, p. 28.

            Part 6     In view of the wonderful promises given us, what should we
 "EVEN SO, COME,     say and do?
    LORD JESUS"
                       "The Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that
                     heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And
                     whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely" (Rev.
                     22:17).

                        "Everyone who hears is to repeat the invitation [of Rev.
                     22:17]. Whatever one's calling in life, his first interest should be
                     to win souls for Christ. He may not be able to speak to congrega-
                     tions, but he can work for individuals. To them he can com-
                     municate the instruction received from his Lord. Ministry does
                     not consist alone in preaching. Those minister who relieve the
                     sick and suffering, helping the needy, speaking words of com-
                     fort to the desponding and those of little faith."—The Desire of
                     Ages, p. 822.
                        "Christ presents to us who are athirst the water of life, that we
                     may drink freely; when we do this we have Christ within us as a
                     well of water springing up into everlasting life. Then our words
                     are full of moisture. We are prepared to water others."—
                     Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 51.

                       What assurance does Jesus give to His church at the close
                     of His testimony? What should be our response? Rev. 22:20.

                       "Come, Lord Jesus. This exclamation is John's response to
                     the testimony of Jesus, who assures the apostle that He is
                     coming quickly.... John was probably reminded of that night in
                     the upper room, more than half a century before, when he heard
                     Jesus declare, 'I will come again' (John 14:3). ... Now, while in
                     holy vision, John is given one last assurance that his blessed
                     Lord is to return, and that, quickly. This assurance comes from
                     the lips of his Master Himself, the faithful and true witness. His
                     heart thrills at the words, and with eager anticipation he looks
                     forward to the day when in reality, not in vision, he will see his
                     blessed Lord face to face."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 7,
                     pp. 898, 899.

THINK IT THROUGH       What is my response to the Saviour's declaration, "Behold, I
                     come quickly"?

                       "Everyone who heareth is to say: Come. Not only the minis-
                     ters, but the people. All are to join in the invitation. Not only by
                     their profession, but by their character and dress, all are to have
                     a winning influence. They are made trustees for the world,
                     executors of the will of One who has bequeathed sacred truth to

                   of joy that makes life all
                   worthwhile, that makes
                   you a person who has
                   something to contribute to
                   everyone you meet, the
                   kind of joy that eliminates
                   the destructive forces of
                   worry and fear from your
                   life and frees you to live
                   and love as a whole per-
                   son? Discover the answer
                   in this remarkable book.
