OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT




Dear Fellow Sabbath School Members,



It is a privilege to bring to you news of an exciting new development in the
Australasian Division. In the rapidly developing island nations of the South
Pacific in recent years, the Church has experienced a thrilling increase. A
vital part of this growth has been its educational system to train its work-
ers and to provide our young people with the opportunity of a Christian
education. However, the facilities that have served so well in the past are
not adequate for the needs of the future, and so the Division Committee has
taken action to establish a new senior college to enable our youth in all the
countries of the South Pacific to obtain an education at a senior level in
our own college.



One thousand acres has been secured in Papua New Guinea near the nation's.
capital, Port Moresby, on which to establish the College. This property is
admirably adapted to meet the requirements of such a college. Several
hundred acres of arable land and a bountiful supply of water will ensure
that this college will be developed in harmony with the blueprint for our
educational institutions.



 Within the Australasian Division there are many Thirteenth Sabbath projects,
 hospitals and schools, which testify to the generosity of our Sabbath School
 members around the world. Over the years they have continued to be a bless-
 ing as they have fulfilled the purposes for which they have been established.
 We would like to thank you for what you have done in the past and we look
 forward with confidence to what you will do this coming Thirteenth Sabbath.



 Yours sincerely,




 K.S. Parmenter,
 President

SAINT UNDER STRESS by Norval Pease, Ph.D.

Why do the innocent suffer? Is there meaning in pain?
Does God send suffering to develop character? How
should we react to suffering? These questions and more
were on the author's mind when he wrote this volume. He
leads us through the book of Job, uncovering with honest
examination God's answers to our human distress. (Dr.
Pease is author of the section on Job in the S.D.A. Bible
Commentary.)
This book, unique as it is, is an essay for each day's study of
the Sabbath School lessons for this quarter. A must for
each one to have and to study.
Available at your local Adventist Book Center, or order
through your church lay activities secretary. U.S. $4.95.

                  JOB, PAIN, AND HEALING
                                      Introduction

   This quarter we will seek answers to a problem that has plagued man from the very
beginning of time: Why suffering? In the first nine lessons we will study passages
from the classic treatment of this topic—the book of Job. This is the first time that Job
has been studied in the Sabbath School lessons. The author of these lessons is also
the author of the comments on the book of Job in the S.D.A. Bible Commentary.
   The book of Job presents some difficulties to the modern reader. Many verses in
the King James Version are hard to understand because they reflect obscurities in the
Hebrew manuscripts. Modern speech translations have endeavored to make these
obscure passages easier to understand. For this reason it is highly recommended
that the student have access to a modern speech translation. The Revised Standard
Version is very helpful. Obscure passages are noted in the footnotes, so the reader is
aware of translation problems. Job, in the Good News Bible (TEV), is colorful and
easy to ,read.
   Another problem in reading Job is the great amount of repetition in the three cycles
of speeches of Job and his friends. These lessons have sought to simplify this
problem by selecting key passages for special study. It is strongly advised that the
student read the entire text as suggested in the assignments for Further Study.
   A brief outline of the book may help to keep the lessons in perspective:
     I. Prose prelude (1:1 to 2:13)
    11. The dialogues between Job and his friends (3:1 to 31:40)
   I11. The speeches of Elihu (32:1 to 37:24)
   IV. God's answer (38:1 to 41:34)
    V. Prose postlude (42:1-17)


   The following paragraph from the S.D.A. Bible Commentary may provide a spring-
board for our study:
   "This is the story of a man finding his way back to normal life after a series of
terrible, unexplainable reverses. The elements in the background that make the
situation dramatic are (1) the contrast between Job's prosperity and his degradation,
(2) the suddenness of his calamity, (3) the problem posed by the philosophy of
suffering common in his day, (4) the cruelty of his friends, (5) the depth of his
discouragement, (6) the gradual ascent to trust in God, (7) the dramatic appearance
of God, (8) the repentance of Job, (9) the humiliation of his friends, and (10) the
restoration of Job."—Volume 3, p. 494.
   Four Adventist sources on Job may be helpful to the student:Job and the Mysteries
of Wisdom, an analysis of the book by Paul T. Gibbs; The Grandeur of Job, a series of
sermonettes by George T. Dickinson; The Problem of Human Suffering, by Paul
Heubach; and pages 493 to 612 of volume 3 of the S.D.A. Bible Commentary. The
Problem of Pain, a popular book by the well-known and capable religious writer, C. S.
Lewis, may also be helpful.
   Lessons 10 through 12 in the quarterly consider three aspects of suffering in a
modern garb--"The Problem of Pain," "The Healing of the Sick," "Why Some Are
Not Healed." The final lesson of the quarter considers the sufferings of Jesus and the
symbols which He gave to His followers which remind them of His experience in
suffering.

                      arose and stood up. The princes refrained talking, and laid
                      their hand on their mouth. The nobles held their peace, and
                      their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth. When the ear
                      heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it
                      gave witness to me" (Job 29:8-11).

                        Job not only had wealth; he also had influence as a result of
                      his honest, loving wife. Referring to this passage, Ellen White
                      says: "God has given in His Word a picture of a prosperous
                      man—one whose life was in the truest sense a success, a man
                      whom both heaven and earth delighted to honor."—Edudation,
                      p. 142. Too many people seek to substitute power and posses-
                      sions for the influence of a holy life.

                        What are some of the characteristics of Job that gained for
                      him the respect of neighbors and friends? Job 29:12-16.

                         If a man has a right relation with God, he will have a right
                      relationship with his fellowmen. A man who is right with God
                      has accepted God's principles of righteousness, and he applies
                      them in his daily life. Right thinking people will honor and
                      respect him even though they may not follow in his footsteps.
                         A God-fearing man may not be popular in society; his com-
                      pany may not be sought on every occasion; but his advice, when
                      sought, is generally well-regarded. And in times of calamity or
                      crisis it is to him that people will go for leadership and direction.
                         As a young minister, I once pastored a church in which there
                      was a very unusual church elder. This man was a businessman
                      who had lived in the community for many years. He had won
                      such respect in the area that it was not unusual for unchurched
                      people to call upon him to preside at funerals. He was known for
                      miles around as a Christian layman of integrity. His concern for
                      people had won the hearts of hundreds of his acquaintances.

THINK IT THROUGH       Are Christians highly regarded in their communities? If not,
                      why not?

                         "The accounts of every business, the details of every transac-
                      tion, pass the scrutiny of unseen auditors, agents of Him who
                      never compromises with injustice, never overlooks evil, never
                      palliates wrong."—Education, p. 144.
                         Job 29:20-25 describes the reputation every Christian should
                      enjoy. Read it in a modern-language translation.

                    deceit; let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may
                    know mine integrity. If my step hath turned out of the way, and

                    charges that had been brought against him by his friends. In this
                    chapter he outlines the principles that regulated his private
                    conduct. Thus we have a comprehensive summary of the ethics
                    of Job. The form is poetic. There is a dramatic flavor. Job calls
                    down curse after curse upon himself if he has falied to live up to
                    the ideals he is stating.

                      In what ways does Job claim to be innocent? The answers
                    are throughout chapter 31.

                      In this passage the words "vanity" and "deceit" are parallel.
                    The word translated "vanity" means "what is morally empty and
                    unreal, insincerity and falsehood."—Victor E. Reichert, Job
                    (Hindead, Surrey: The Soncino Press, 1946), p. 157. How eager
                    we should be that God makes us honest and guileless.
                      What could be more basic than honesty? This is a virtue that
                    makes the difference between real character and hollow pre-
                    tense. Note that Job's code of ethics deals with motives.
                       "In this same thirty-first chapter of Job appears the spirit and
                    even many of the specific precepts of Christ's Sermon on the
                    Mount. This ancient Old Testament discourse offers that same
                    mountaintop perspective of spiritual matters by emphasizing
                    impulse of heart over grasp of hand. ' "If ... my heart has gone
                    after my eyes—" ' (31:7), Job sighs. It is for his heart, not his
                    eyes, that he is concerned."—Paul T. Gibbs, Job and the Mys-
                    teries of Wisdom (Nashville, Tenn.: Southern Publishing As-
                    sociation, 1967), p. 117.

THINK IT THROUGH      Was Job truly humble when he claimed to be innocent? Can
                    one be honest and humble at the same time? How?

                      "Principle, right, honesty should be ever cherished. Honesty
                    will not tarry where policy is harbored. They will never agree;
                    one is of Baal, the other of God. The Master requires His ser-
                    vants to be honorable in motive and action. All greed and av-
                    arice must be overcome. Those who choose honesty as their
                    companion will embody it in all their acts. To a large class, these
                    men are not pleasing, but to God they are beautiful."—

              Part 3     By what strong expression does Job affirm his fidelity to his
        FAITHFUL TO    wife?
           HIS WIFE
                         "If my heart has been enticed by a woman or I have lain in
                       wait at my neighbour's door, may my wife be another man's
                       slave, and may other men enjoy her" (Job 31:9, 10, NEB).

                         The seventh commandment of the Decalogue says "Thou
                       shalt not commit adultery" (Ex. 20:14). The Sermon on the
                       Mount says, "Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her
                       hath committed adultery with her already in his heart" (Matt.
                       5:28). Job anticipated both of these pronouncements.

                         What is Job's evaluation of the act of adultery? Job 31:11,
                       12. Compare Lev. 20:10.

                          Job recognizes that adultery is a sin against God because
                        God has laid down the relationships that ought to obtain
                        between men and women. (See Joseph's experience in Genesis
                       39:9.) It is always the better part of wisdom to follow in God's
                       precepts. (See Job 28:28.) But adultery is also a social sin, and
                       judges are expected to apply the law. A society that does not
                       uphold the highest standards of moral relationships will soon
                       disintegrate, and there will be a lack of respect for persons and
                       personal rights.
                          Adultery ends in personal loss'. Job speaks of a "fire that con-
                       sumeth to destruction" (Job 31:12). It means the loss of home,
                       peace and happiness—three things invaluable to men.
                          Job was a family man, and he took his responsibilities seri-
                       ously. He valued faithfulness to his wife, and he was concerned
                       that he deserve the respect of his children and his friends.
                          Job's abhorrence of adultery extended to banishment of sex-
                       ual thoughts about another than his wife. He says, "I have made
                       a solemn promise never to look with lust at a girl" (Job 31:1,
                       TEV).
                          "Job understood that mere avoidance of the overt act of
                       adultery was not sufficient. In order to meet God's standard the
                       thinking as well as the actions must be pure. Job met the prob-
                       lem by entering into an agreement with himself that he would
                       not allow his mind to be responsive to the enticements of lust. In
                       the figurative language of the text, a covenant [KJV] was made
                       between the conscience and the eyes—an agreement that im-
                       posed a definite obligation on the eyes not to gaze upon that
                       which would suggest impure thoughts."—S.D.A. Bible Com-

           Part 4     What was Job's conduct in relation to the needy and poor?
     CONCERNED
 ABOUT THE POOR       "If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have
                    caused the eyes of the widow to fail; or have eaten my morsel
                    myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof; ... if I
                    have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without
                    covering; if his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not
                    warmed with the fleece of my sheep; if I have lifted up my hand
                    against the fatherless, when I saw my help in the gate: then let
                    mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be broken
                    from the bone" (Job 31:16-22).

                       Job was a very wealthy man, and it is not uncommon for
                    people of wealth to be considered insensitive to the needs of the
                    poor. Sometimes the accusation is justified, sometimes not.
                    Eliphaz accused Job of mistreating the poor (Job 22:1-7). Job
                    denied this claim (29:12-16).
                       The Scriptures have a great deal to say about the responsibil-
                    ity of the favored to the less favored. The fatherless and the
                    widowed are singled out for special mention (Ex. 22:22; James
                    1:27). In both the Old Testament and the New, obligations are
                    laid on believers to the needs of the poor.

                      What did Jesus say of His own earthly presence in contrast
                    with the presence of the poor? Matt. 26:11.

                      There will never be a time on this earth when there are no
                    poor. Calamities can wipe out riches in a day. Injustices and
                    oppression are characteristics of a sinful society. Famines and
                    lack of adequate distribution of food supplies can lead to
                    hunger and starvation. These things we know obtain in the
                    world today.

THINK IT THROUGH      What is my obligation to the poor?

                      "The blessings of salvation, temporal as well as spiritual, are
                    for all mankind. There are many who complain of God because
                    the world is so full of want and suffering; but God never meant
                    that this misery should exist. He never meant that one man
                    should have an abundance of the luxuries of life, while the
                    children of others cry for bread. The Lord is a God of benevo-
                    lence. He has made ample provision for the wants of all, and
                    through His representatives, to whom He has entrusted His
                    goods, He designs that the needs of all His creatures shall be
                    supplied."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 273.
                       "It is God's purpose that the rich and the poor shall be closely
                    bound together by the ties of sympathy and helpfulness. He bids
                    us interest ourselves in every case of suffering and need that

             Part 5      What did Job reject as the basis of his hope and joy?
        NOT RUINED
         BY RICHES      "If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold,
                      Thou art my confidence; if I rejoiced because my wealth was
                      great, and because mine hand had gotten much ... ; this also
                      were an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I should have
                      denied the God that is above" (Job 31:24-28).

                        How serious a mistake did Job consider trust in wealth to
                      be? Verse 28.

                         In this passage Job expresses a prominent biblical theme.
                      The Decalogue says to mankind, "Thou shalt not covet" (Ex.
                      20:17). The Sermon on the Mount says, "Lay not up for your-
                      selves treasures upon earth . . . : but lay up for yourselves
                      treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt,
                      and where thieves do not break through nor steal: for where
                      your treasure is, there will your heart be also" (Matt. 6:19-21).
                      The parable of the rich fool (Luke 12:16-21) tells of a man who
                      made gold his hope, and "God said unto him, Thou fool, this
                      night thy soul shall be required of thee" (verse 20). Paul warns
                      against trusting in "uncertain riches" (1 Tim. 6:17). And Jesus
                      exclaimed, "How hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter
                      into the kingdom of God!" (Mark 10:24).

THINK IT THROUGH       In what ways is this theme relevant to me whether or not I
                      am rich?

                         "It is God who gives men power to get wealth, and He has
                      bestowed this ability, not as a means of gratifying self, but as a
                      means of returning to God His own. With this object it is not a sin
                      to acquire means. Money is to be earned by labor. Every youth
                      should be trained to habits of industry. The Bible condemns no
                      man for being rich if he has acquired his riches honestly. It is the
                      selfish love of money wrongfully employed that is the root of all
                      evil. Wealth will prove a blessing if we regard it as the Lord's, to
                      be received with thankfulness and with thankfulness returned
                      to the Giver.
                         "Of what value is untold wealth if it is hoarded in expensive
                      mansions or in bank stock? What do these weigh in comparison
                      with the salvation of one soul for whom the Son of the infinite
                      God has died?"—Testimonies, vol. 6, pp. 452, 453.
                         "All the treasures which you possess, be they ever so valu-
                      able, would not be rich enough to buy you peace and hope,
                      which would be infinite gain, if it cost you all you have and the
                      toils and sufferings of a lifetime. A strong, clear sense of eternal
                      things, and a heart willing to yield all to Christ, are blessings of
                      more value than all the riches and pleasures and glories of this
                      world."—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 576.

                                                                           July 4
          Part 6     What was Job's attitude to his enemies?
     LOVING HIS
       ENEMIES       "I have never been glad when my enemies suffered,
                        or pleased when they met with disaster;
                        I have never sinned by praying for their death." (Job
                   31:29, 30, TEV).

                      Job not only tolerated his enemies, he didn't rejoice in their
                   misfortunes. His words remind us of the exhortation of Jesus to
                   His disciples in Matthew 5:43-48. An analysis of this passage
                   uncovers the following message:
                     Your Father in heaven:
                        makes His sun to rise on the evil and on the good.
                        sends rain on the just and on the unjust.
                      You:
                        love only those who love you.
                         salute only your brethren.
                      Be like your Father in heaven:
                         Love your enemies; bless those who curse you.
                         Pray for those who persecute you.
                      This is what it means to be "perfect." This is Christian matur-
                   ity at its best. This is godlikeness at its highest level.
                      Romans 12 has been called "Paul's Sermon on the Mount."
                   Here the idea of self-sacrificing love is expressed as follows:
                      "Let love be without dissimulation" (verse 9).
                      "Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love;
                         in honour preferring one another" (verse 10).
                      "Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not"
                            (verse 14).
                      "Recompense to no man evil for evil" (verse 17).
                      "If thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him
                         drink" (verse 20).

THINK IT THROUGH     Old Testament and New Testament alike (Job, Jesus, Paul,
                   and others) call for us to love not just the lovely and the loving,
                   but the unlovely and the unloving. This is the acid test of a true

                     "It is not earthly rank, nor birth, nor nationality, nor religious
                   privilege, which proves that we are members of the family of
                   God; it is love, a love that embraces all humanity. Even sinners
                   whose hearts are not utterly closed to God's Spirit, will respond
                   to kindness; while they may give hate for hate, they will also give
                   love for love. But it is only the Spirit of God that gives love for
                   hatred. To be kind to the unthankful and to the evil, to do good
                   hoping for nothing again, is the insignia of the royalty of

              Part 1     How prosperous was Job before calamity struck him?
            BEFORE
         THE STORM       "There were born unto him seven sons and three
                       daughters. His substance also was seven thousand sheep,
                       and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen,
                       and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so
                       that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east" (Job
                       1:2, 3).

                          "In the northern part of the Arabian Peninsula, east of the
                       Jordan River and the Dead Sea, in the land of Edom lives this
                       man of Uz. With an immense retinue of servants who bear
                       burdens in time of peace and weapons in time of war, with seven
                       thousand sheep to provide wool and meat and milk, with three
                       thousand camels for carrying merchandise to world markets,
                       with five hundred yoke of oxen for plowing broad acres at the
                       edge of the desert, where even to this day hover farms and
                       cities—in such affluence Job has reared his family of seven sons
                       and three daughters. Until disaster strikes, Job's is an idyllic
                       existence. . . .
                          "Job's life has been a success in the truest sense. Before
                       disaster overtook him, God's approval shed light and warmth
                       into his life. Those were days of rejoicing.... In harmony with his
                       good life and traditional beliefs, he anticipated a restful old age
                       and peaceful demise."—Paul T. Gibbs, Job and the Mysteries of
                       Wisdom, pp. 12, 13.

                         How did Job show that he recognized that life has its dan-
                       gers and people their weaknesses? Job 1:4, 5.

                          Job seemed to be able to handle prosperity himself, but he
                       was concerned about his children. Their affluence made possi-
                       ble a level of social gaiety that endangered their religious ex-
                       perience.'As a wise, concerned father, Job prayed to God about
                       the problem. "Amid the festivities of his sons and daughters, he
                       trembled lest his children should displease God. As a faithful
                       priest of the household, he offered sacrifices for them individu-
                       ally. He knew the offensive character of sin, and the thought that
                       his children might forget the divine claims, led him to God as an
                       intercessor in their behalf."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A.
                       Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 1140.
                          It still happens that children of wealthy and pious parents may
                       inherit their parents' wealth and not their piety. Piety is not
                       inherited; it comes from personal relationship with God.

THINK IT THROUGH         What is there that I can do to protect my family from the
                       dangers of affluence? What are some of the greatest dan-
                       gers?

                                                                         July 7
           Part 2     The scene changes from earth to the presence of God. The
        TROUBLE     Lord calls Satan's attention to the faithfulness of Job.
        BREWING
                      How did Satan respond to God's expressed approval of
                    Job?

                      "Doth Job fear God for nought? Hast not thou made an
                    hedge about him, and about his house, and about all he hath
                    on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and
                    his substance is increased in the land. But put forth thine hand
                    now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy
                    face" (Job 1:9-11).

                       After Job proves his ability to accept loss without losing his
                    faith in God, Satan challenges God to "touch his bone and his
                    flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face" (Job 2:5).
                        "Satan insinuated that Job served God from selfish motives.
                    . .. He attempted to deny that true religion springs from love and
                    an intelligent appreciation of God's character, that true wor-
                    shipers love religion for its own sake—not for reward; that they
                    serve God because such service is right in itself, and not merely
                    because heaven is full of glory; and that they love God because
                    He is worthy of their affections and confidence, and not merely
                    because He blesses them."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 3,
                    p. 500.

                      What other Bible character was true to God in spite of many
                    calamities? What was the secret of his steadfastness? 2 Cor.
                    11:23-27; Rom. 8:36-39;

                      "The powers of evil try in two ways to destroy men—either
                    they work through wealth, power, and position to influence him
                    to compromise and forget God, or they engulf him with suffer-
                    ing, misfortune, and discouragement in an endeavor to break
                    his faith and morale. It seems that the average man can endure
                    only so much prosperity or so much adversity without buckling
                    under the strain."—Norval F. Pease, Think on These Things

                    1969), p. 165.

 THINK IT THROUGH     Which would you rather have—the dangers that come from
                    prosperity or the test that comes from adversity? Why?

                       "Job had stood the test of prosperity ... (Job 1:1). Now he was
                    to be subjected to the test of adversity. The devil was saying to
                    God with a sneer, 'Every man has his price. Job will fold under
                    adversity.' God was about to demonstrate to the world that there
                    are men who can be destroyed neither by prosperity nor
                    adversity."—Norval F. Pease, Think on These Things, p. 165.

           Part 3      What personal losses did Job experience? Job 1:13-19.
        TRAGEDY
         STRIKES      "While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and
                    said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking
                    wine in their eldest brother's house: and, behold, there came
                    a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners
                    of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are
                    dead; and I only am escaped alone tote!! thee" (Job 1:18,19).

                      It is not easy to bear financial loss, but it is even harder to
                    suffer the loss of loved ones. Children can be a source of
                    comfort and courage, and what a tragedy when they are gone!

                       What further calamity was visited on Job? Job 2:7.

                       Boils are very painful. They are also very disfiguring. In utter
                    misery Job leaves his home and goes outside the city where the
                    refuse is usually dumped and burned. There he sits in the ashes,
                    using the pieces of broken pottery that are lying around to
                    scrape his body when it itches, and to take away the pus from his
                    boils. (See verse 8.) What a contrast is presented here! Job, who
                    used to sit in affluence and luxury, now sits in the midst of
                    discarded rubbish. Perhaps he feels that his life is as useless as
                    the articles around him. His wife only adds insult to injury as she
                    suggests that he might as well give up his faith in God and die!
                    (See verse 9.)

THINK IT THROUGH      Why does God sometimes permit tragedies to fall on us?

                       Job could not see any reason for his tragedies. But for us who
                    can read the story of Job the curtain of mystery is drawn aside,
                    and we can see that some tragedies are not the result of our
                    doings; rather, they are the machinations of an enemy who
                    wants to see all of us lose our faith in God.
                       "He [God] permitted affliction to come upon Job, but He did
                    not forsake him.... God permits trials to assail His people, that
                    by their constancy and obedience they themselves may be
                    spiritually enriched, and that their example may be a source of
                    strength to others. . . .
                       "God has always tried His people in the furnace of affliction. It
                    is in the heat of the furnace that the dross is separated from the
                    true gold of the Christian character."—Patriarchs and
                    Prophets, p. 129.
                       But for the protecting providence of God, there would be no
                    security against Satan's assaults. Only in the hereafter will we
                    understand the extent to which we have been shielded from
                    "the flaming darts of the evil one" (Eph. 6:16, RSV).

When Disaster Struck         LESSON 2                             ❑ Wednesday
                                                                        July 9

           Part 4     How did Job respond to the loss of his goods and children?
          INITIAL
      RESPONSES       "Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head,
                    and fell down upon the ground, and worhipped, and said,
                    Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I
                    return thither: the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away;
                    blessed be the name of the Lord. In all this Job sinned not, nor
                    charged God foolishly" (Job 1:20-22).

                      The rending of his cloak was a symbol of deep mourning.
                    Shaving the head indicated that he was no longer interested in
                    personal appearance. Yet Job fell to the ground and worshiped.
                    His relation to God was still whole, and in his agony he came to
                    God to express a faith and confidence that would not let go. In
                    this regard Job leads the way in telling us how we should
                    respond when experiences come our way that hurt us deeply
                    and that we cannot understand. Apparently it did not as yet
                    occur to Job to blame God for his situation.

                      How did Job's wife respond to her husband's affliction, and
                    how did Job answer? Job 2:9, 10.

                      Job's wife cannot take the calamities that have fallen as much
                    upon her as upon her husband. Her faith in God is shattered.
                    She suggests that her husband might as well "curse God," even
                    though she knows that this can only lead to death. What a
                    contrast to her husband's attitude! Furthermore, it means that
                    Job has lost another possible pillar of spiritual support.
                      It is noteworthy that never again in the story of Job is Satan
                    mentioned. He had been proved wrong. Here was a man who
                    maintained his loyalty to God in face of the most severe trouble.
                    And he knew nothing of the dialogue between the Lord and
                    Satan that precipitated his trouble. God still cares for His own.
                      "Satan is busy every moment, going to and fro, walking up
                    and down in the earth, seeking whom he may devour. But the
                    earnest prayer of faith will baffle his strongest efforts."—
                    Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 294.

 THINK IT THROUGH      What does Job teach us regarding submission to tragedy?

                       "Christ is our Guide and Comforter, who comforts us in all our
                    tribulations. When He gives us a bitter draught to drink, He also
                    holds a cup of blessing to our lips. He fills the heart with submis-
                    sion, with joy and peace in believing, and enables us to say
                    submissively, Not my will, but Thy will, 0 Lord, be done. 'The
                    Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name
                    of the Lord' (Job 1:21). With this submission hope is resur-
                    rected, and the hand of faith lays hold upon the hand of infinite
                    power."—Selected Messages, bk. 2, p. 270.

           Part 5     How did three of Job's friends respond to his afflictions?
          THREE
      "FRIENDS"        "Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was
                    come upon him, they came every one from his own place;
                    Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the
                    Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to
                    come to mourn with him and to comfort him. And when they
                    lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up
                    their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and
                    sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven" (Job 2:11,
                    12).

                       "The circumstances here mentioned suggest the lapse of
                    considerable time since the calamities had overtaken Job. . . .
                    This passage of time helps to explain Job's change of attitude
                    from the calm resignation of ch. 2:10 to the deep discourage-
                    ment of ch. 3. The initial blows of tragedy appeared not to be as
                    damaging to Job's morale as were the weeks of constant suffer-
                    ing of body and distress of mind that followed."—S.D.A. Bible
                    Commentary, vol. 3, p. 504.

                      How did the three friends relate to Job? Job 2:13.

                       At this point in the narrative the basic issue begins to emerge.
                    The three friends of Job—and Job himself—had been nurtured
                    in the philosophy that misfortune is an evidence of specific sin.
                    One can understand the silence of the three men in the
                    presence of Job. They would find it very difficult to accuse their
                    friend of wrongdoing.
                       "What these men find when they see Job is worse than they
                    expected. At the sight of this social pariah their esteem is turned
                    to loathing; they are struck dumb. Casual comment is inappro-
                    priate in the presence of monumental grief. Besides, they dare
                    not bless whom God has cursed. And they believe that a situa-
                    tion so obviously marked by the curse of God is dangerous even
                    to innocent bystanders. . . .
                       " 'And they sat with him on the ground seven days and seven
                    nights, and no one spoke a word to him.' (2:13.) This lengthen-
                    ing silence is ominous, but Job understands. He has grown up
                    with his friends in the same traditions. He knows that the men
                    dare not speak in his behalf because of their conviction that he
                    is evil. So these friends who come to comfort Job become yet
                    another affliction, possibly the greatest of them all."—Paul T.
                    Gibbs, Job and the Mysteries of Wisdom, pp. 15, 16.

THINK IT THROUGH      Do we sometimes subscribe to the fallacy that misfortune
                    indicates that a person has sinned, and prosperity indicates
                    the blessing of God?

                                                                         July 11
         Part 6    With what words of discouragement does Job break the
        A LIGHT silence with his friends?
     GROWS DIM
                   "0 God, put a curse on the day I was born;
                     put a curse on the night when I was conceived!
                   Turn that day into darkness, God.
                   Never again remember that day;
                     never again let light shine on it.
                   Make it a day of gloom and thick darkness;
                     cover it with clouds, and blot out the sun.
                   Blot that night out of the year,
                     and never let it be counted again;
                     make it a barren, joyless night" (Job 3:2-7, TEV).

                      Job breaks into poetry as he calls a curse on the day he was
                   born. The rest of the book of Job is in poetic form except for the
                   conclusion, chapter 42.
                      "The poetry of Job is the unrhymed, unmetered parallelism of
                   all Hebrew poetry—Psalms, Proverbs, parts of Isaiah, and
                   elsewhere. It is a parallelism of sense, not of sound. Hebrew
                   poetry scorns the tinkle of modern rhyme. It disdains the count-
                   ing of syllables. Instead, it measures cadences in those natural
                   stresses required by interpretation."—Paul T. Gibbs, Job and
                   the Mysteries of Wisdom, p. 56.
                      In Hebrew poetry, the second line of the couplet either (1)
                   repeats in different words, (2) explains, or (3) completes the
                   thought of the first line of the couplet. It has been compared to a
                    voice and its echo. For example see Job 3:9, TEV:
                      "Keep the morning star from shining;
                         give that night no hope of dawn."
                    This is an example of repeating a thought in different words.
                    The first line is the "voice." The second line is the "echo."

THINK IT THROUGH      What is your evaluation of Job's complaint to God? Was he
                   right or wrong? Why?

                     "It must not be concluded that Job's statements of ch. 3
                   represent a laudable reaction to calamity. This poem contains
                   much of complaint and bitterness that, under the cir-
                   cumstances, may be forgiven but not approved. The fact that
                   Job did complain of his lot makes him seem closer to humanity
                   than if he had been unperturbed by his misfortunes. Job was
                   spiritually great, not because he was never discouraged, but
                   because he eventually found his way out of discouragement. If
                   we wish to see a perfect example of fortitude under suffering,
                   we must look at Jesus, not at Job. Job, in his suffering, cursed
                   the day of his birth; Jesus said, 'For this cause came I unto this
                   hour' (John 12:27)."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 508.

           Part 1     In reply to Job, what principle does Eliphaz enunciate?
        A WRONG
         ANSWER       "Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being inno-
                    cent? or where were the righteous cut off? Even as I have
                    seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the
                    same. By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his
                    nostrils are they consumed" (Job 4:7-9).

                      With what appeal does Eliphaz close his speech? Job 5:27.

                       Eliphaz, along with the other friends of Job, was a
                    philosopher. He had looked at life and had concluded that God
                    invariably rewarded goodness with prosperity and sin with
                    affliction. This was part of his "wisdom," his system of thought.
                    From whence had this philosophy come?
                       "Satan, the author of sin and all its results, had led men to
                    look upon disease and death as proceeding from God,—as
                    punishment arbitrarily inflicted on account of sin. Hence one
                    upon whom some great affliction or calamity had fallen had the
                    additional burden of being regarded as a great sinner.
                      "Thus the way was prepared for the Jews to reject Jesus. He
                    who 'hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows' was looked
                    upon by the Jews as 'stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted;'
                    and they hid their faces from Him. Isa. 53:4, 3.
                      "God had given a lesson designed to prevent this. The history
                    of Job had shown that suffering is inflicted by Satan, and is
                    overruled by God for purposes of mercy. But Israel did not
                    understand the lesson. The same error for which God had re-
                    proved the friends of Job was repeated by the Jews in their
                    rejection of Christ."—The Desire of Ages, p. 471.

THINK IT THROUGH      What is more important than attempting to assign blame for
                    calamities that fall upon us?

                      Eliphaz was steeped in a mistaken philosophy of suffering, as
                    were his friends; but this did not mean that they were wicked.
                    They loved Job enough to come to his side. They were genuinely
                    concerned. And Eliphaz gave some very good counsel. (See Job
                    5:8-11, 17, 18.)
                      There are people who have mistaken ideas about God, but
                    who love God and their fellowmen. Christians must be able to
                    distinguish between a wrong head and a wrong heart. Of
                    course, the ideal is that both head and heart be right.

                     their place. . . . For now ye are nothing; ye see my casting
                     down, and are afraid" (Job 6:15-21).

                        "Job compares his friends to a stream which is swollen and
                     turbulent in winter, when its waters are not so sorely needed,
                     but which dries up and disappears in the heat of summer. These
                     streams, known as wad is, are common in the Eastern countries.
                     The fullness, strength, and noise of these temporary streams in
                     winter are compared to the attitude of Job's friends toward him
                     in the days of his prosperity. The drying up of the waters at the
                     approach of summer is compared to the failure of these friends
                     in time of affliction."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 515.

                       By contrast, how did Jesus describe the one who believes in
                     Him? John 7:38.

                        Those who do not understand God's ways can give a kind of
                     consolation that fails to meet its objective. But the one who
                     believes in Christ and His truth will be a source of refreshing and
                     counsel and strength to those who associate with him. Only
                     God can give us a right perspective and enable us to see life as it
                     is.
                        Later in the chapter Job challenges his friends:
                        "All right, teach me; tell me my faults,
                          I will be quiet and listen to you.
                        Honest words are convincing,
                          but you are talking nonsense. . . .
                        Look me in the face. I won't lie. . . .
                          Don't condemn me. I'm in the right.
                         But you think I am lying—
                          you think I can't tell right from wrong" (Job 6:24-30, TEV).

THINK IT THROUGH       How may we be sure that we always speak the right word in
                     the right place?

                        The "dry brooks" disappoint when they are needed most. Just
                     as Job had a right to expect understanding and help from his
                     friends, so the world has a right to expect Christians to be
                     "rivers of living water." This means that the Christian will be
                     absolutely honest, scrupulously pure, genuinely kind, consis-
                     tently dependable. If any of these characteristics are lacking, we
                     are like dry rivers that disappoint the needy world.

                                                                            July 15
          Part 3      What complaint does Job express against God?
            JOB
     CHALLENGES       "How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I
            GOD    swallow down my spittle? I have sinned; what shall I do unto
                   thee, 0 thou preserver of men? why hast thou set me as a
                   mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself? And why
                   dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine
                   iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek
                   me in the morning, but I shall not be" (Job 7:19-21).

                      What was Job's condition at this time? Job 7:4, 5, 13, 16.

                      Job's speech is a cry of despair. It illustrates certain perils that
                   beset humanity:
                      "(1) The danger of too much emphasis on the vanity of life.
                   Men should remember their great value in the sight of God. (2)
                   The danger of unrestrained expression of emotion. When Job
                   removed his inhibitions, he complained in bitterness, ques-
                   tioned with irreverence, accused with rashness, and begged
                   with impatience. (3) The tendency of the human heart, when
                   blinded by grief or agitated by passion, to misconstrue God's
                   dealings. (4) The certainty that good men may have much of the
                   old unrenewed nature in them lying unsuspected until occasion
                   calls it forth. One would hardly have anticipated Job's outburst
                   of passion."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 519.
                      We can almost see the anguish of his face and hear the
                   bitterness in his voice when he exclaims, "No! I can't be quiet! I
                   am angry and bitter. I have to speak" (Job 7:11, TEV).
                      "Into the experience of all there come times of keen disap-
                   pointment and utter discouragement—days when sorrow is the
                   portion, and it is hard to believe that God is still the kind bene-
                   factor of His earthborn children; days when troubles harass the
                   soul, till death seems preferable to life. It is then that many lose
                   their hold on God and are brought into the slavery of doubt, the
                   bondage of unbelief. Could we at such times discern with
                   spiritual insight the meaning of God's providences we should
                   see angels seeking to save us from ourselves, striving to plant
                   our feet upon a foundation more firm than the everlasting hills,
                   and new faith, new life, would spring into being."—Prophets
                   and Kings, p. 162.
                      Some may ask, "Did not Job do the very thing Satan said he
                   would do? How can we interpret these petulant speeches?" Job
                   was like a little child with tears streaming down his cheeks,
                   shouting "Why?" to a parent whom he dearly loves but cannot
                   understand. Job's wails are not cries of hostility but of pain.

The First Dialogue      LESSON 3                                 ❑ Wednesday
                                                                      July 16
          Part 4     What did Bildad say was the teaching of ancient wise men?
        ANCIENT
      TRADITION      "Reeds can't grow where there is no water;
      DEFENDED          they are never found outside a swamp.
                     If the water dries up, they are the first to wither,
                        while still too small to be cut and used.
                     Godless men are like those reeds;
                        their hope is gone, once God is forgotten" (Job 8:11-13,
                   TEV).

                     Job could not have missed the unkind thrust in Bildad's
                   speech. Earlier in the speech he said, "Your children must have
                   sinned against God, and so he punished them as they deserved"
                   (verse 4, TEV). Nothing could have hurt Job more than this.
                   Bildad considered Job as suffering for his sins. He closed his
                   speech observing that God does not abandon the faithful. Bil-
                   dad was a good man with a mistaken notion. His better self
                   yearned to comfort Job, but his tradition got in the way.

                     What was Jesus' teaching about the relationship between
                   calamity and personal sinfulness? Luke 13:1-5.

                     "It is very natural for human beings to think that great
                   calamities are a sure index of great crimes and enormous sins;
                   but men often make a mistake in thus measuring character. We
                   are not living in the time of retributive judgment. Good and evil
                   are mingled, and calamities come upon all. Sometimes men do
                   pass the boundary line beyond God's protecting care, and then
                   Satan exercises his power upon them, and God does not inter-
                   pose. Job was sorely afflicted, and his friends sought to make
                   him acknowledge that his suffering was the result of sin, and
                   cause him to feel under condemnation. They represented his
                   case as that of a great sinner; but the Lord rebuked them for
                   their judgment of His faithful servant."—Ellen G. White Com-
                   ments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 1140.

THINK IT THROUGH     How should I respond when I find people suffering from a
                   terrible accident or sickness?

                      An acquaintance falls victim to cancer, heart trouble, or some
                   other ailment. Do we immediately begin to conjecture as to how
                   he might have avoided this illness had he lived differently? Do
                   we assume that his misfortune may have been a judgment from
                   God because of his careless manner of life? Just as Job's
                   friends did not know why Job was allowed to suffer, we also do
                   not know the reasons for sickness and misfortune. Our conjec-
                   tures, like those of Job's friends, may merely increase the suffer-
                   ing. Instead of concerning ourselves with the question "Why?"
                   let us say, "How can I help?"

The First Dialogue       LESSON 3                                   ❑ Thursday
                                                                        July 17
           Part 5     What does Job say of God and himself?
    GOD'S POWER
      AND JOB'S       "If it is a contest of strength, behold him!
      WEAKNESS           If it is a matter of justice, who can summon him?
                      Though I am innocent, my own mouth would condemn me;
                         though I am blameless, he would prove me perverse"
                    (Job 9:19, 20, RSV).

                      Out of this contrast between his own weakness and God's
                    power comes a feeling of hopelessness and bewilderment. He
                    seems to feel trapped with no way of escape. He says:
                      "For he is not a man, as I am, that I might answer him,
                        that we should come to trial together.
                      There is no umpire between us,
                        who might lay his hand upon us both" (Job 9:32, 33, RSV).
                      (The word "daysman" in the King James Version means "um-
                    pire.")

                      In what way does Jesus fill the need that Job felt? Heb. 2:17,
                    18; 1 Tim. 2:5.

                       "In his argument with God, Job feels that there is no one to
                    whom he can look as an arbiter. On one of two conditions only,
                    he thinks, could the contest be more even between himself and
                    God: (1) If God, divesting Himself of all His divine attributes,
                    became man, and (2) if some umpire, or arbiter, could be found
                    to decide the contest. However, Job thought that neither condi-
                    tion was possible. The gospel provides a fulfillment of both
                    conditions, 'The I AM is the Daysman between God and human-
                    ity, laying His hand upon both' (DA 25). Not that we need to
                    conceive of Jesus as settling an argument between man and
                    God, but He is the One who represents God to man, the One
                    through whom man can understand and approach God. See
                    Heb. 2:17, 18."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 525.

THINK IT THROUGH      Why should I be careful when I complain?

                      Job's peevishness (see chap. 10:14, 15) must have hurt the
                    heart of God. Likewise, our complaints are sometimes unworthy
                    of our profession as Christians. Ellen White once wrote to a
                    family as follows:
                      "If there was a cloud in sight, you seemed to forget that the
                    sun ever shone; and clouds and darkness were ever about you.
                    God sent you affliction; He removed your treasure from you that
                    you might discern between prosperity and real sorrow. But you
                    did not subdue your hearts before Him and repent of the great
                    sin of ingratitude which had separated you from His love. Like
                    Job, you felt that you had cause for grief, and would not be
                    comforted. Was this reasonable?"—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 313.

The First Dialogue      LESSON 3                                         ❑ Friday
                                                                          July 18
          Part 6     What advice does Zophar offer to Job?
    REPENTANCE
         URGED       "If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands
                   toward him; if iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, and let ,
                   not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles" (Job 11:13, 14).

                     What did Zophar say would be the results if Job would
                   repent? Job 11:15-20,

                      "Now Zophar speaks. His speech adds little that is new to the
                   ideas expressed by his friends. He reveals a lack of sympathy,
                   gentleness, and refinement perhaps surpassing that of either of
                   the other speakers. Zophar's violent outburst is provoked by
                   Job's denial of his guilt and his accusations against God.
                   Zophar's speech may be divided into three parts: (1) the expres-
                   sion of a desire for such a declaration from God as would
                   convince Job of his guilt (vs. 2-6); (2) a description intended to
                   warn Job of God's exalted knowledge, by virtue of which he
                   charges against every man his sins (vs. 7-12); and (3) a stress on
                   the necessity of repentance as the only condition of recovering
                   his former prosperity (vs. 13-20)."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary,
                    vol. 3, p. 528.
                      "There is wickedness in our world, but all the suffering is not
                   the result of a perverted course of life. Job is brought distinctly
                    before us as a man whom the Lord allowed Satan to afflict....
                    His friends came to comfort him, but they tried to make him see
                    that he was responsible, by his sinful course, for his afflictions.
                    But he defended himself, and denied the charge, declaring,
                    Miserable comforters are ye all. By seeking to make him guilty
                    before God, and deserving of His punishment, they brought a
                    grievous test upon him, and represented God in a false light; but
                    Job did not swerve from his loyalty, and God rewarded His
                    faithful servant."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible
                   Commentary, vol. 3, p. 1140.

THINK IT THROUGH     What is the best way to comfort a person who is suffering?

                     There are times when it is essential to call people to repen-
                   tance. When necessary, this should be done fearlessly but in
                   love. There are other times when comfort is what is needed.
                     "A consecrated Christian life is ever shedding light and com-
                   fort and peace. It is characterized by purity, tact, simplicity, and
                   usefulness. It is controlled by that unselfish love that sanctifies
                   the influence. It is full of Christ, and leaves a track of light
                   wherever its possessor may go."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p.

             Part 1     What are the points of contrast that Job makes between
               THE    puny man and the sovereign God?
       SOVEREIGNTY
            OF GOD      "Old men have wisdom,
                          but God has wisdom and power.
                        Old men have insight;
                          God has insight and power to act.
                        When God tears down, who can rebuild,
                          and who can free the man God imprisons?"
                        "He takes away the wisdom of rulers
                          and makes leaders act like fools.
                        He dethrones kings and makes them prisoners;
                          he humbles priests and men of power.
                        He silences men who are trusted,
                          and takes the wisdom of old men away.
                        He disgraces those in power
                          and puts an end to the strength of rulers" (Job 12:12-14,
                      17-21, TEV).

                        Job 12 contrasts the tradition of men, which his friends value
                      so highly, with the wisdom and power of God. In the previous
                      chapter, Zophar has asked, "Canst thou by searching find out
                      God?" (Job 11:7). Job 12 is, in a sense, an answer to this
                      question. Job recognizes God as Monarch and Master of all.

                        How fully did Job come to trust God? Job 13:15.

                          There are variant translations of the text, but if the King James
                      translation is correct, this seems to be the "first rung in the
                      ladder by which Job emerged from the abyss of despair."—
                      S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 534.
                          Job's recognition of the power of God was commendable. He
                      had yet, however, to sense fully the love of God.
                          "It is the darkness of misapprehension of God that is en-
                      shrouding the world. Men are losing their knowledge of His
                      character. It has been misunderstood and misinterpreted. At
                      this time a message from God is to be proclaimed, a message
                      illuminating in its influence and saving in its power. His charac-

                      shed the light of His glory, the light of His goodness, mercy, and
                      truth."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 415.

THINK IT THROUGH        Why is the great power of God a source of comfort rather
                      than danger?

                         "Many limit divine Providence and divorce mercy and love
                      from His character. They urge that the greatness and majesty of

The Second Dialogue          LESSON 4                                    ❑ Monday
                                                                           July 21

           Part 2     Because of his great misery, what does Job consider will
    THE PROBLEM     bring him relief?
        OF DEATH
                       "Man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the
                    ghost, and where is he? As the waters fail from the sea, and
                    the flood decayeth and drieth up: so man lieth down, and
                    riseth not: till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake,
                    nor be raised out of their sleep. 0 that thou wouldest hide me
                    in the grave" (Job 14:10-13).

                       On a number of occasions, Job refers to what seemed to him
                    the certainty of impending death. For example: "The end of my
                    life is near. I can hardly breathe; there is nothing left for me but
                    the grave" (17:1, TEV). "My only hope is the world of the dead,
                    where I will lie down to sleep in the dark" (17:13, TEV). His
                    intense suffering made the prospect of death attractive. He
                    explores the meaning of death as one would read a travel guide
                    of a country he was planning to visit.

                      What hope did Job have if he should die? Job 14:13-15.

                       Critics have claimed that the Old Testament has no message
                    of resurrection or eternal life. While it is true that the life beyond
                    is not stressed in the Old Testament as in the New, it is also true
                    that there are glimpses of eternity that shine through man's
                    uncertainty regarding the future. Job 14 is one of those
                    "knotholes" in the high fence that obscures our view of eternity.
                    Job doesn't say much, but he says enough so we can know he
                    understood.
                       "The doctrine of the resurrection is latent in the Old Testa-
                    ment and clearly revealed in the New Testament teaching. Old
                    Testament references include Ps 16.10, 49.15, Isa 26.19, Dan
                    12.2, and Hos 13.14."—Harold Lindsell, ed., Harper Study Bible,
                     RSV (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Zondervan Publishing House, 1965),
                     p. 740 (footnote).

 THINK IT THROUGH     On what basis can I have hope in the resurrection?

                      "By bearing the penalty of sin, by going down into the grave,
                    Christ has brightened the tomb for all who die in faith. God in
                    human form has brought life and immortality to light through
                    the gospel. In dying, Christ secured eternal life for all who
                    believe in Him. In dying, He condemned the originator of sin and
                    disloyalty to suffer the penalty of sin—eternal death."—
                    Testimonies, vol. 6, pp. 230, 231.
                      Job lived long before the cross. He could only catch a glimpse
                    of the hope beyond. What an experience it will be for him and all
                    the other Old Testament saints when, in the life beyond, they see
                    the reality of that for which they hoped!

           Part 3     How does Eliphaz react to Job's expressions of faith?
        TRUST IN
       TRADITION      "Art thou the first man that was born? or wast thou made
                    before the hills? Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost
                    thou restrain wisdom to thyself? What knowest thou, that we
                    know not? what understandeth thou, which is not in us? With
                    us are both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder
                    than thy father" (Job 15:7-10). (See also Job 15:17, 18.)

                       "At this point we must discontinue speaking of Job's three
                    'friends.' They have become his opponents instead. They are
                    not enemies, however, for they purpose still to help their former
                    friend. But Job faces the three across a thorny controversy.
                       "Informed about the Palestinian east wind and the ancients'
                    impression of it, we are better prepared to evaluate the taunt of
                    Eliphaz against Job. He says, 'Should a wise man ... fill himself
                    with the east wind?' (15:2). This sarcastic thrust indicates more
                    than noise and emptiness. It implies the presence of heat, of hot
                    air made abrasive by the presence of dust and sand. Eliphaz
                    accuses Job of designing his argument to excuse his sin.... He
                    believes it is because Job 'has stretched forth his hand against
                    God' and has bid 'defiance to the Almighty' (15:25), that he will
                    writhe 'in pain all his days' (15:20). Job has a conviction of
                    innocence; his friends maintain a suspicion of guilt."—Paul T.
                    Gibbs, Job and the Mysteries of Wisdom, p. 98.

                    How does Job react to his friends' "comfort"? Job 16:2, 3.

                        "Job's professed friends were miserable comforters, making
                    his case more bitter and unbearable, and Job was not guilty as
                    they supposed.... The intense agony of the soul that has been
                    overcome by Satan and is feeling worsted and helpless—how
                    little is it comprehended by those who should meet the erring
                    one with tender compassion!"—Testimonies to Ministers, p.
                    350.

THINK IT THROUGH      Why is it usually useless to argue with people?

                      The friends of Job were ded icated to the defense of a position.
                    Job was intent on defending his integrity. The result was harsh-
                    ness, vindictiveness, sarcasm on both sides. Later, when God
                    appeared, He didn't attempt to settle the argument—He merely
                    revealed Himself, and the argument lost its significance. Some-
                    times our religious life descends to the level of argument—
                    defending positions, doctrines, and personal ego. This kind of a
                    religious experience does not prepare people for the kingdom.

The Second Dialogue          LESSON 4                               ❑ Wednesday
                                                                         July 23

          Part 4     What does Job say his friends have given him in contrast to
  WORDS VERSUS      what he needs?
       WARMTH
                      "I have heard words like that before;
                         the comfort you give is only torment.
                      Are you going to keep on talking forever?
                         Do you always have to have the last word?
                      If you were in my place and I in yours,
                         I could say everything you are saying.
                      I could shake my head wisely
                         and drown you with a flood of words.
                      I could strengthen you with advice
                         and keep talking to comfort you.
                      But nothing I say helps,
                         and being silent does not calm my pain" (Job 16:1-6, TEV).

                      Job has listened for weeks to a torrent of words, but the real
                    needs of his body and soul have not been met. He is still in pain.
                    We, likewise, live under a barrage of words. Modern communi-
                    cation media carry the spoken word to the ends of the earth.
                    Words batter our eardrums every waking hour.

                      What kind of words are effective for men's salvation? John
                    17:17; Eph. 4:15.

                       There is one ingredient that is missing in most of the words we
                    hear—love. This missing factor is pointed out in a letter written
                    by Ellen White and published in Testimonies, volume 2, pages
                    436 through 439:
                       "In your family you have met with opposition and a manifest
                    disrelish of the truth, but you have failed to meet these trials in

The Second Dialogue           LESSON 4                                ❑ Thursday
                                                                          July 24
           Part 5      What are two of the beliefs on which Job places his hope?
 AN INTERCESSOR
                      "Behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on high"
                    (Job 16:19).
                      "I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at
                    the latter day upon the earth" (Job 19:25).

                       These statements mark one of the most significant rungs in
                    the ladder from hopelessness to hope.
                       "This [verse 25] is one of the most frequently quoted texts in
                    the book. It represents a significant advance in Job's progress
                    from despair to confidence and hope. 'From the depths of
                    discouragement and despondency Job rose to the heights of
                    implicit trust in the mercy and the saving power of God' (PK
                    163). The Hebrew word translated 'redeemer,'go'el, is rendered
                    'avenger,' or 'revenger' (Num. 35:12, 19, 21, 24, 25, 27), and
                    kinsman or near kinsmen (Ruth 2:20; 3:9, 12; 4:1, 3, 6, 8, 14 ... ).
                    God is frequently called go'el in the sense that He vindicates the
                    rights of men and ransoms those who have come under the
                    dominion of another (Isa. 41:14; 43:14; 44:24; 47:4; etc.).
                       "Job has already expressed his desire to have an 'umpire'
                    between him and God (ch. 9:32-35). In ch. 16:19 he has declared
                    his conviction that his 'witness is in heaven.' In v. 21 of the same
                    chapter he longs to have an advocate to plead his cause with
                    God. In ch. 17:3 he calls upon God to be surety for him. Having
                    recognized God as 'umpire,' witness, advocate, surety, it is
                    perfectly logical that he should arrive at the recognition of God
                    as his redeemer. This text represents one of the OT revelations
                    of God as man's redeemer, a profound truth that was fully
                    revealed to men in the person and mission of Jesus Christ."—
                    S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 549.

                      When did Job expect to see his Redeemer? Job 19:25-27.

                      Job made a giant step upward when he came to realize that
                    there was Someone in heaven who was looking out for him, and
                    whom he could look forward to seeing at the last day. He didn't
                    know the full meaning of the gospel, but he caught a glimpse of
                    One who would see him through death.

THINK IT THROUGH      How do I have a better understanding of my Redeemer than
                    Job did? (See 1 John 2:1.)

                      "The cross lifts you up from the lowlands of earth, and brings
                    you into sweetest communion with God. Through bearing the
                    cross your experience may be such that you can say, ' "I know
                    that my Redeemer liveth," and because He lives, I shall live also.'
                    What an assurance is this!"—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A.

The Second Dialogue          LESSON 4                                   ❑ Friday
                                                                         July 25

           Part 6     The last part of the second dialogue includes (1) Bildad's
        A CRY OF    second speech (ch. 18) in which he describes the misery and
        ANGUISH     ruin of the wicked; (2) Job's second reply to Bildad (ch. 19) in
                    which he describes anew his suffering, pleads for pity, and
                    declares his confidence in a Redeemer; and (3) Zophar's sec-
                    ond discourse (ch. 20) in which he recounts the miseries and
                    ruin which await the wicked. Notice Job's problems.

                      What persons forsook Job?

                      "God has made my brothers forsake me;
                        I am a stranger to those who knew me;
                       my relatives and friends are gone.
                      Those who were guests in my house have forgotten me;
                        my servant girls treat me like a stranger and a foreigner.
                      When I call a servant, he doesn't answer—
                        even when I beg him to help me.
                      My wife can't stand the smell of my breath,
                        and my own brothers won't come near me.
                      Children despise me and laugh when they see me.
                      My closest friends look at me with disgust;
                        those I loved most have turned against me.
                      My skin hangs loose on my bones;
                        I have barely escaped with my life" (Job 19:13-20, TEV).

                      What does Job want from his friends?

                      "You are my friends! Take pity on me!
                       The hand of God has struck me down.
                      Why must you persecute me the way God does?
                       Haven't you tormented me enough?" (Job 19:21,22, TEV).

                      This poignant appeal for pity was entirely ignored by the next
                    speaker, Zophar (ch. 20). In fact, none of Job's friends have a
                    word of compassion for the sufferer. Why? Pity had been slain
                    by false theology. Pity, more often spoken of as compassion, is
                    one of the chief attributes of God and of His true followers.
                      "God wants us to love one another as brethren. He wants us to
                    be pitiful and courteous."—Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 193.

 THINK IT THROUGH      How can I develop an understanding and merciful relation-
                     ship with those around me?

                       "Although the customs of the world are no criterion for us, yet
                     I have been shown that the pitying sympathy and the benevo-
                     lence of the world for the unfortunate in many cases shame the
                     professed followers of Christ."—Testmonies, vol. 3, p. 524.

                    this be your consolations. Suffer me that I may speak; and
                    after that I have spoken, mock on" (Job 21:1-3).

                        Another translation of this text is:
                        "Listen to me, do but listen,
                        and let that be the comfort you offer me.

                        This is the cry of millions of distraught souls—"Please listen!"
                     they beg. Most of us are adept at talking. We have answers, solu-
                     tions, and suggestions aplenty. But we have never learned the
                     art of listening. Now as in Job's time distressed people crave the
                     sympathizing attention of a friend. Words are not the only an-
                     swer—understanding sympathy is sometimes better expressed
                     by the listening ear than the wagging tongue.
                        "Many long intensely for friendly sympathy. God has given
                    each of us an identity of our own, which cannot be merged in
                    that of another; but our individual characteristics will be much
                     less prominent if we are indeed Christ's and His will is ours. Our
                    lives should be consecrated to the good and happiness of
                     others, as was our Saviour's. We should be self-forgetful, ever
                     looking out for opportunities, even in little things, to show
                    gratitude for the favors we have received of others, and watch-
                    ing for opportunities to cheer others and lighten and relieve
                    their sorrows and burdens by acts of tender kindness and little
                    deeds of love. These thoughtful courtesies, that, commencing
                    in our families, extend outside the family circle, help make up
                    the sum of life's happiness; and the neglect of these little things
                    makes up the sum of life's bitterness and sorrow."—

                   gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not
                   her calf. They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their
                   children dance. They take the timbre! and harp, and rejoice at
                   the sound of the organ. They spend their days in wealth, and in
                   a moment go down to the grave" (Job 21:7-13).

                        Job's observations regarding the prosperity of the wicked are
                      out of harmony with the philosophy of his friends. They have
                      pictured prosperity as the mark of acceptance with God. Job's
                      experience has convinced him that the wicked often enjoy tem-
                      poral prosperity.

                        What problem does the psalmist observe as he looks at the
                      wicked? Ps. 73:2-12, 16.

                        The psalmist recognized God's gifts to His people, but he also
                      recognized the obvious truth that prosperity wasn't limited to
                      the good. He resolved the problem only after he had entered the
                      temple and realized the final end of the wicked. (See Ps. 73:17-
                      20, 27.)
                        The psalmist sees not only the apparent prosperity of the
                      wicked, but he also sees their inner unhappiness and their
                      ultimate fate.

THINK IT THROUGH        Why should the Christian not be envious of the wicked?

                         The reaction of the servant of God to adversity and prosperity
                      is described in Habakkuk. In the opening of his book this prophet
                      had expressed his concern over the fact that the wicked did not
                      seem to be restrained in their wickedness and the righteous
                      were suffering. He complained to God, and God told him that
                      "the just shall live by his faith" (Hab. 2:4). Finally Habakkuk
                      understood the solution to his concern:
                         "Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be
                      in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall
                      yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there
                      shall be no herd in the stalls; yet !will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy
                      in the God of my salvation" (Hab. 3:17, 18).

             Part 3     What good, but misplaced, advice did Eliphaz give to Job?
           WASTED
            ADVICE      "Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby
                      good shall come unto thee. Receive, I pray thee, the law from
                      his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart. If thou return to
                      the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt put away in-
                      iquity far from thy tabernacles. Then shalt thou lay up gold as
                      dust, and the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooks. Yea,
                      the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have plenty
                      of silver. For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty,
                      and shalt lift up thy face unto God" (Job 22:21-26).

                        "This verse [Job 22:21] begins Eliphaz' appeal to Job to mend
                      his ways. Eliphaz takes it for granted that Job is a sinner, wholly
                      unreconciled to God and unacquainted with Him. The appeal is
                      beautiful but incorrectly applied."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary,
                      vol. 3, p. 559.
                        How much advice is misdirected! Like Eliphaz, we think we
                      understand another's problem, when actually we do not know
                      the motives and the backgrounds that cause his behavior.

                        With what spirit should the Christian approach another as
                      he counsels? Gal. 6:1.

                         Ellen White wrote the following counsel to an individual:
                         "There are many who need our sympathy and advice, but not
                      that advice which implies superiority in the giver and inferiority
                      in the receiver. K needs the softening, melting love of God in her
                      heart. The looks and tones of the voice should be modulated by
                      thoughtful consideration and tender, respectful love. Every
                      look and every tone of voice that implies, 'I am superior,' chills
                      the atmosphere of her presence and is more like an icicle than a
                      ray of light that gives warmth.... Assertions and advice which
                      savor of a dictatorial spirit are not good fruit. You need the
                      softening, melting love of Christ in your heart, which will be
                      reflected in all your acts toward your family and to all who are
                      brought under your influence."—Testimonies, vol. 3, pp. 534,
                      535.

THINK IT THROUGH        What is the basic objective in giving counsel?

                          Samuel T. Coleridge has said, "Advice is like snow; the softer
                      it falls, the longer it dwells upon and the deeper it sinks into the
                      mind."—Quoted by Jacob M. Braude, Speaker's Encyclopedia
                      of Stories, Quotations, and Anecdotes (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.:
                      Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1955), p. 19.
                          To advise a good person not to be bad may be discouraging
                      and destructive. Often the best counsel we can give is to put
                      people in touch with God, the everlasting Counselor.

The Third Dialogue        LESSON 5                                 ❑ Wednesday
                                                                        July 30
           Part 4     What was Job's attitude toward being tested?
   REAWAKENING
  OF CONFIDENCE       "He knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I
                    shall come forth as gold" (Job 23:10).

                       "This is one of the key verses of the book. Although Job could
                    not seem to find God, he believed that God was aware of his
                    ways and purposeful in His dealings with him. Job was begin-
                    ning to understand that he was being tried. He still did not know
                    of Satan's challenge regarding him. One of the rungs of the
                    ladder by which Job climbed from despair to faith was the
                    recognition on his part that he was not being punished or
                    unjustly treated, but rather was being tested that he might
                    emerge as pure gold from a furnace."—S.D.A. Bible Commen-
                    tary, vol. 3, p. 561.
                       "Job is now confident that when God has tried him he will
                    come forth as gold.... The suffering man holds to the idea that
                    his trouble comes from God. All along he has not perceived
                    Satan's share in it. Therefore his faith is the more remarkable.
                    He is right to some extent, because his trouble is only what God
                    permits. God may not be the direct agent of a person's affliction.
                    This may come from the cruelty of men or from other unde-
                    tected causes. Yet it is all within the restraint of God. . . . Job
                    perceives that he is being tried by God. This is the first time that
                    he has given evidence of holding such an idea. Hitherto he has
                    been simply dismayed and distressed at the problem of suffer-
                    ing. He has had no theory to oppose to his friends' orthodox
                    notion that it is the merited punishment of sin. That that notion
                    was wrong, experience and observation have made him see
                    quite clearly. But hitherto he has not been able to supply an
                    alternative idea. Now there dawns on him a perception of the
                    disciplinary purpose of suffering.... God tries his servant, not to
                     punish him, but because he values him.... The end aimed at will
                     be attained. The assurance of this lies in the previous thought of
                     God's knowledge. He does not need to assay the soul in order to
                    discover for himself whether it is of true gold. He knows the
                     worth of his servants. He adapts their discipline to their re-
                     quirements. It seems disproportionate, but it is suitable; for God
                     knows the way of his people; therefore he will bring them forth
                    as gold."—The Pulpit Commentary, Job (New York: Funk and
                     Wagnalls Company), pp. 404, 405.

                    experience? 1 Peter 1:6, 7.

The Third Dialogue          LESSON 5                                   ❑ Thursday
                                                                           July 31
             Part 5     According to Bildad, how valuable is a man in God's sight?
           WHAT IS
       MAN WORTH?       "Then what about man, that worm, that insect?
                          What is man worth in God's eyes?" (Job 25:6, TEV).

                         This is the final statement in Bildad's brief speech as trans-
                      lated in the TEV. Bildad infers that man is worth very little. The
                      context of his question is the greatness of God. Job is one of the
                      major biblical books in proclaiming the insignificance of man.
                      (See Job 4:18, 19; 15:14; 22:2.)

                        What are some of the aspects of man that seem to make him
                      of little value to God? Ps. 144:3, 4; Rom. 3:10-12.

                        It seems unreasonable that the great God of the universe
                      should pay much attention to a creature whose span of life is
                      comparatively brief, or who has decided to pursue his sinful
                      ways and ignore God. But the fact is that God in His infinite love
                      and mercy does not ignore anyone, not even the simplest of His
                      creatures. Sparrows may be cheap in the marketplace, but God
                      notices their fall. (See Matt. 10:29.) Man was created in the
                      image of God and therefore has intrinsic value that must not be
                      underestimated.
                        There are texts that acclaim man's worth: "Thou hast made
                      him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with
                      glory and honour" (Ps. 8:5).

THINK IT THROUGH        What determines the worth of man?

                        "As John beholds the height, the depth, and the breadth of
                      the Father's love toward our perishing race, he is filled with
                      admiration and reverence. He cannot find suitable language to
                      express this love, but he calls upon the world to behold it:
                      'Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon
                      us, that we should be called the sons of God.' What a value this
                      places upon man! Through transgression the sons of men be-
                      came subjects of Satan. Through the infinite sacrifice of Christ,
                      and faith in His name, the sons of Adam become the sons of
                      God. By assuming human nature, Christ elevates humanity.
                      Fallen men are granted another trial and are placed where,
                      through connection with Christ, they may educate, improve,
                      and elevate themselves, that they may indeed become worthy of
                      the name 'sons of God.' "—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 563.
                        Man's worth is determined by his relationship to God. Without
                      God, he is of little value. With God he is of infinite worth.

         Part 6     How does Job feel about his experience at this point?
       A CLEAR
    CONSCIENCE      "I swear by the living Almighty God,
                       who refuses me justice and makes my life bitter—
                       as long as God gives me breath,
                       my lips will never say anything evil,
                       my tongue will never tell a lie.
                    I will never say that you men are right;
                       I will insist on my innocence to my dying day.
                    I will never give up my claim to be right;
                       my conscience is clear" (Job 27:1-6, TEV).

                     "This is the only place where Job resorts to an oath. Under the
                  solemn circumstance of the occasion, in making his last appeal
                  to his friends, Job thinks it appropriate to preface his remarks
                  with an appeal to God as his witness."—S.D.A. Bible Commen-
                  tary, vol. 3, p. 568.

                    How shall a Christian have a clean conscience? Heb. 9:14.

                     "In this age of the world, when vice and fashion control men
                  and women, Christians should possess virtuous characters and
                  a large share of good common sense. If this were the case,
                  countenances which are now clouded, bearing the marks of
                  disease and depravity, would be hopeful and cheerful, lighted
                  up by true goodness and a clear conscience."—Testimonies,
                  vol. 2, p. 535.
                     "Such is Job's confidence in his own sincerity that he feels
                  free to appeal to the God who, it has appeared, has been treat-
                  ing him as if he were guilty. . .
                     "Job's friends have tried to extort a confession of guilt from
                  him. Job not only stands firm in the consciousness of his great
                  integrity, but makes a definite commitment as to his future
                  loyalty. Regardless of pressure and tradition, Job is determined
                  to be honest. . . .
                     "Some men under duress will admit wrongdoing of which
                  they are not guilty. This Job refused steadfastly to do."—S.D.A.
                  Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 568.
                     "Conscience is the voice of God, heard amid the conflict of
                  human passions."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 120.
                     Conscience must be educated. People with misdirected con-
                  sciences have been responsible for some of the greatest crimes
                  of history. But a conscience directed by the Spirit of God can
                  sort out the evil from the good, can direct the decision-making

                                               The book of Job describes two kinds
                                            of wisdom: first, the "wisdom" of
                                            tradition, as accepted by Job's friends;
                                            and second, the wisdom of God. The
                                            meaning of the word in a given text is
                                            determined by the context. Job 28 is an
                                            effort to reveal the true nature and
                                            source of divine wisdom.

           Part 1      What characteristics does Job attribute to God?
     THE SOURCE
      OF WISDOM       "With him is wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and
                    understanding" (Job 12:13).

                       Read Proverbs 8:1-3, 22-31, in a modern language translation.
                       In the above verse Job acknowledges that God has wisdom,
                    that is, He knows the right thing to do at the right time in the
                    right way and in the right place. But Job still has a problem with
                    the goodness of God. How can God be good and apparently
                    arbitrary? (See verses 14-22.)
                       There is no question that God can perform what He is about to
                    do, but can we always understand what He does and why He
                    does it? There is the rub! We cannot always understand why God
                    seems to overturn what men have thought to be wise and proper.
                    There is no power that can overthrow God or resist His action.
                    Hence God has His way in matters He undertakes. But why are
                    things so contrary to what we would consider right?
                       Job is searching for understanding, and although he may
                    have many questions in his mind, at least he knows where he
                    can find the right answers.

                      How can the Christian become wise and have understand-
                    ing? James 1:5.

                       It is no fault to raise questions and wonder about our situa-
                    tion. The danger is that we go to the wrong sources of informa-
                    tion (e.g., to the so-called scholar who has no faith in God) or
                    resort to divining and witchcraft.
                       The wise man personifies wisdom and declares that wisdom
                    is seeking to be known and heard. (See Prov. 8:1-3.) Wisdom
                    has always existed as an attribute of God (verses 22-31). Further-
                    more, wisdom is always available to the one who asks God for it,
                    and therefore there is really no excuse for being constantly in
                    the dark about God's plans and actions.

THINK IT THROUGH      What are the practical implications of the fact that God is the
                    source of wisdom?

                       "In answer to earnest prayer He will give wisdom to those who
                     strive to do their duty conscientiously and intelligently."—
                    Testimonies, vol. 7, p. 61.
                       "It is not the strength of human instruments, but the power
                    and wisdom of Him who employs them and works with them that
                    makes men successful in doing the work that is necessary to be
                    done."—Testimonies, vol. 3, p. 57.

                    wisdom."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commen-

True Wisdom        LESSON 6                                           ❑    Monday
                                                                          August 4
          Part 2      What does Job say wisdom is?
       THE FEAR
    OF THE LORD       "Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom" (Job 28:28).
                      "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom" (Prov.
                    9:10).

                       What is meant by "the fear of the Lord"? "A number of
                    occurrences [in the Bible] of the word 'fear' involve the reveren-
                    tial awe that man should feel for the majesty, power, and posi-
                    tion of his divine Maker. In this sense the term would include any
                    of the varying degrees of emotional response comprehended in
                    our words 'reverence,' respect,"awe; and 'fear'; and it may
                    occasionally signify even the more extreme reaction of awe
                    mingled with terror that a mortal man would naturally feel when
                    in the immediate presence of God (Heb 12:21; Jgs 6:22, 23) or of
                    angels (Lk 1:12, 13). This type of fear is, of course, not to be
                    included in the harmful emotion that is disparaged in 1 Jn 4:18,
                    but is rather commended in the Scriptures (Rev.14:7; Job 28:28;
                    Ps 2:11; 111:10; etc.)."—S.D.A. Bible Dictionary, art. "Fear."
                       This "fear of the Lord" that is so highly commended, that is
                    called "wisdom" and "the beginning of wisdom" is basically
                    reverence for God. It is the kind of reverence that causes us to
                    have a deep respect for Him, His Word, His house, His day. This
                    reverence is so important that "when men cast off the fear of
                    God they are not long in departing from honor and
                    integrity."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 557.

                      What special significance does "the fear of the Lord" have
                    in the last days? Rev. 14:7.

                      "By the first angel, men are called upon to 'fear God, and give
                    glory to Him' and to worship Him as the Creator of the heavens
                    and the earth. In order to do this, they must obey His law. . . .
                    Without obedience to His commandments no worship can be
                    pleasing to God. . . .
                      "The duty to worship God is based upon the fact that He is the
                    Creator and that to Him all other beings owe their existence.
                    And wherever, in the Bible, His claim to reverence and worship,
                    above the gods of the heathen, is presented, there is cited the
                    evidence of His creative power."—The Great Controversy, pp.
                    436, 437.

THINK IT THROUGH      What is the difference between fearing God and being
                    afraid of Him?

                      "Unless correct ideas of true worship and true reverence are
                    impressed upon the people, there will be a growing tendency to
                    place the sacred and eternal on a level with common things, and
                    those professing the truth will be an offense to God and a
                    disgrace to religion."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 500.

          THE POOR     treated? Eccl. 9:14-16.
          WISE MAN
                          The "wisdom literature" of the Old Testament includes the
                       books of Job, Proverbs, and Ecclesiastes. Today's scripture is a
                       selection from Ecclesiastes that shows, by stating a parable,
                       that wise men are not always appreciated. In the case of the
                       parable, the lack of appreciation was the result of the poverty of
                       the wise man. In the case of Job, his friends failed to recognize
                       his wisdom because of his misfortunes, which they misinter-
                       preted as punishments from God.
                          "People are categorized, not by what they are but by what
                       they have. In 1959 Vance Packard published his well-known
                       book, Status Seekers. In this book he described the stratifica-
                       tion of American society into five classes, (1) The Real Upper
                       Class, (2) The Semi-Upper Class, (3) The Limited-Success Class,
                       (4) The Working Class, and (5) The Real Lower Class.
                          "Regarding the 'real upper class,' Packard quotes an infor-
                       mant who describes what it takes to stay on that level, 'First, I'd
                       say money is the most important. In fact, nobody's in this class if
                       he doesn't have money; but it isn't just money alone. You've got
                       to have the right family connections, and you have got to behave
                       yourself or you get popped out. And if you lose your money,
                       you're dropped. If you don't have money, you're just out.'—
                       Page 40.
                          "Solomon recognized this point of view in his day. Here, in
                       our text, was a man who was known to be wise, and who
                       revealed his worth by saving his city in time of siege. The rich
                       and poor alike owed their lives to him, but he couldn't make the
                       social register because he was poor. In a class-conscious soci-
                       ety he was soon forgotten. . . .
                          " ....Jesus taught a gospel of equality before God. He stressed
                       service as the mark of superiority. He preached His gospel to the
                       rich and poor alike, and He expected them to live together in the
                       church as brothers."—Norval Pease, Think on These Things, p.
                       185.

THINK IT THROUGH         How is the Christian to respond when he is ignored because
                       he lacks wealth and influence?

                         The poor man in Ecclesiastes 9:14-16 did not deliver the city
                       for recognition. He acted as he did because he was wise.
                       Likewise, the humble but wise Christian can exert an influence
                       far out of proportion to his wealth and social position. Wisdom,
                       motivated by compassion, can be a powerful force for good.

True Wisdom        LESSON 6                                              ❑ Friday
                                                                          August 8

          Part 6      What is the reward promised to those who are wise?
   THE ULTIMATE
        REWARD        "They that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the
                   firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the
                   stars for ever and ever" (Dan. 12:3).

                       Another meaning of the expression translated "they that be
                    wise" is those "who impart wisdom" (NIV, footnote). Thus the
                    wise are not only the ones who have acquired wisdom, but they
                    have passed their wisdom on to others. Wisdom is not a charac-
                    teristic that one keeps to oneself; it has to be shared, and in the
                    sharing many are helped.
                       The context of this passage points us forward to the Chris-
                    tian's hope—the second coming of our Lord. That will be the
                    time when God's faithful, living and dead, will receive their
                    inheritance.
                       "What is done through the co-operation of men with God is a
                    work that shall never perish, but endure through the eternal
                    ages. He that makes God his wisdom, that grows up into the full
                    stature of a man in Christ Jesus, will stand before kings, before
                    the so-called great men of the world, and show forth the praises
                    of Him who hath called him out of darkness into His marvelous
                    light. Science and literature cannot bring into the darkened
                    mind of men the light which the glorious gospel of the Son of
                    God can bring. The Son of God alone can do the great work of
                    illuminating the soul."—Fundamentals of Christian Education,
                    pp. 199, 200.

                      What was God's response to Solomon when he asked for
                    wisdom and understanding? 1 Kings 3:11-14.

                      Wisdom brings other blessings in its train. Therefore one
                    should seek wisdom first, just as one could seek first the king-
                    dom of God and His righteousness. (See Matt. 6:33.)
                      In Job's day mining operations represented the greatest ac-
                    complishment of man's inventive genius. Yet this was not true
                    wisdom. In our day we have seen a tremendous explosion of
                    knowledge, especially in scientific areas. This, likewise, is not
                    the highest expression of wisdom.

THINK IT THROUGH      Why is the increase of knowledge today a mixed blessing?

                      It took great genius to unlock the mysteries of the atom. Does
                    man have the wisdom to use that knowledge constructively?
                      In the final judgment, will that which we consider "wisdom"
                    stand up under the scrutiny of God? Fortunately, the wisdom
                    that God will reward is within the reach of all.

    (Job 33:14-19, TEV).             Eliphaz never returned to this theme.
                                     He never emphasized it as Elihu does.
                                        "Job also once touched the same
                                      point. He said, But God' "knows the

                                      And neither has Job ever appeared to

                                                                        August 12
           Part 3     What principle did Elihu express that was certainly true?
     WHEN YOUTH
        IS RIGHT      "God teaches men through suffering
                        and uses distress to open their eyes" (Job 36:15, TEV).

                      Elihu's idea was correct. God does teach through suffering.
                    He was wrong; however, in applying this principle to Job, be-
                    cause he didn't understand the circumstances behind Job's
                    misfortunes. This situation illustrates the importance of Jesus'
                    counsel, "Judge not, that ye be not judged." We, like Elihu, may
                    have a Correct understanding of principles; but we may err in
                    applying these principles to the lives of others because we lack
                    insight into backgrounds and motives.

                      What characteristic of Jesus as the Messiah can give us all
                    courage? Isa. 11:3, 4.

                      It is only too easy to judge another by what we see on the
                    outside or by what we hear from others. Such judgment is
                    always suspect. We are assured that we ourselves will not be
                    judged this way at the judgment bar of God.

                      What example from the Old Testament shows that suffering
                    may be the lot of the righteous, but through it all there are
                    lessons to learn? Gen. 37:18-36.

                      Joseph did not deserve what he got, but the experience did
                    him good rather than harm.
                      "In the providence of God, even this experience was to be a
                    blessing to him. He had learned in a few hours that which years
                    might not otherwise have taught him... .
                      "Then his thoughts turned to his father's God. . . . Joseph
                    believed that the God of his fathers would be his God. He then
                    and there gave himself fully to the Lord, and he prayed that the
                    Keeper of Israel would be with him in the land of his exile.
                      "His soul thrilled with the high resolve to prove himself true to
                    God—under all circumstances to act as became a subject of the
                    King of heaven. He would serve the Lord with undivided heart;
                    he would meet the trials of his lot with fortitude and perform
                    every duty with fidelity. One day's experience had been the
                    turning point in Joseph's life. Its terrible calamity had trans-
                    formed him from a petted child to a man, thoughtful, coura-
                    geous, and self-possessed."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pp.
                    213, 214.

THINK IT THROUGH      Compare the difficult experiences of Moses, Daniel, and
                    Jeremiah to see if you can make a good case for Elihu's claim
                    that God teaches men through suffering.

Suffering as Discipline        LESSON 7                           ❑ Wednesday
                                                                     August 13
           Part 4     What does Peter pray will follow the saints' suffering?
      SUFFERING
   AS DISCIPLINE      "The God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal
                    glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while,
                    make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you" (1 Peter
                    5:10).

                      What else does Peter say about suffering as a discipline?
                    1 Peter 4:1, 2, 12, 13.

                      Peter had himself experienced the discipline of suffering.
                      "There had been a time in Peter's experience when he was
                    unwilling to see the cross in the work of Christ. When the
                    Saviour made known to the disciples His impending sufferings
                    and death, Peter exclaimed, 'Be it far from Thee, Lord: this shall
                    not be unto Thee.' Matthew 16:22. Self-pity, which shrank from
                    fellowship with Christ in suffering, prompted Peter's remon-
                    strance. It was to the disciple a bitter lesson, and one which he
                    learned but slowly, that the path of Christ on earth lay through
                    agony and humiliation. But in the heat of the furnace fire he was
                    to learn its lesson."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 525.

                      What figure of speech is used of the Lord in His purification
                    of the Levites? Mal. 3:3, 4.

                       "This is the process, the refining, purifying process, which is
                    to be carried on by the Lord of hosts. The work is most trying to
                    the soul, but it is only through this process that the rubbish and
                    defiling impurities can be removed. Our trials are all necessary
                    to bring us close to our heavenly Father, in obedience to His will,
                    that we may offer to the Lord an offering in righteousness."—
                    Testimonies, vol. 3, p. 541.

THINK IT THROUGH      What bitter experience have I passed through that is an
                    example of the truthfulness of Elihu's statement that God
                    teaches men through suffering?

                      When Peter became a disciple of Christ, he fell far short of
                    Christ's standard of discipleship. He was rough, impetuous, and
                    self-confident. He learned much from observing and listening to
                    his Lord. But some lessons he could only learn through suffer-
                    ing. In like manner our characters are refined through pain.
                      "God whispers to us in our pleasures, speaks in our con-
                    science, but shouts in our pains: it is His megaphone to rouse a
                    deaf world."—C. S. Lewis, The Problem of Pain (New York: The
                    Macmillan Company, 1948), p. 81.

                                                                         August 14
             Part 5     What were some of Paul's experiences in suffering?
            PAUL'S
         SUFFERING      "We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are
                      perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken;
                      cast down, but not destroyed; always bearing about in the
                      body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus
                      might be made manifest in our body" (2 Cor. 4:8-10).

                         This is the testimony of a Christian disciplined by much suffer-
                      ing. He had learned how to relate to all kinds of affliction "that
                      the life also of Jesus might be made manifest" (verse 10). Phil-
                      lips translates it this way: "Every day we experience something
                      of the death of Jesus, so that we may also show the power of the
                      life of Jesus in these bodies of ours."

                        How did Christ teach Paul the disciplinary value of suffer-
                      ing? 2 Cor. 12:7-10.

                         "Through trials and persecution, the glory—character—of
                      God is revealed in His chosen ones. The church of God, hated
                      and persecuted by the world, are educated and disciplined in
                      the school of Christ."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing,
                      p. 31.

                        What was the secret of Paul's ability to live above his cir-
                      cumstances? Phil. 4:11-13.

                         "While the Lord has not promised His people exemption from
                      trials, He has promised that which is far better. He has said, 'As
                      thy days, so shall thy strength be.' My grace is sufficient for
                      thee: for My strength is made perfect in weakness.'
                      Deuteronomy 33:25; 2 Corinthians 12:9. If you are called to go
                      through the fiery furnace for His sake, Jesus will be by your side
                      even as He was with the faithful three in Babylon."—Thoughts
                      From the Mount of Blessing, p. 30.

THINK IT THROUGH        How does discipline help us in relation to others?

                         "If we were delivered miraculously from all sickness, how
                      could we sympathize with the sufferer? Only when we have felt
                      the scourge of pain can we fully understand what another per-
                      son is experiencing. The person who has looked death in the
                      face may learn something about life that he can learn in no other
                      way. The person who has had to give up cherished ambitions
                      because of physical limitations is much less likely to be critical
                      of the other man who is meeting a similar problem."—Norval

                   Christ, who is perfect and at every moment has been perfect,
                   needed to learn obedience. Two observations may help to an-
                   swer this query: (1) As far as His earthly life is concerned Christ
                   developed like other human beings. He 'increased in wisdom
                   and stature, and in favour with God and man.' ... He learned by
                   observation and experience as do others. (2) Though as God
                   prior to the incarnation Christ was omniscient, yet He did not
                   know by experience the problems confronting men as they seek
                   to render obedience to God. By becoming man and by facing
                   the temptations of life as a man, Christ gained this knowledge.
                   He thus met one of the essential qualifications for the high
                   priesthood, namely that the appointee belong to the human
                   family."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 430.
                     In this truth lies one of the great mysteries of the gospel. Jesus
                   Himself accepted suffering and death, the common lot of man-
                   kind. Only by humbling Himself in this way could He be truly
                   human. Only thus could He identify Himself with humanity. In
                   view of this, should we expect to be excused from suffering?

                    What did Jesus teach about the discipline of suffering?
                   Matt. 16:24, 25.

                     This statement of Jesus emphasizes a great truth: Those who
                   accept the discipline of self-denial, of suffering, of risk for Christ
                   will "find" their lives. Multitudes are looking for meaning in life.
                   Here is the answer.

THINK IT THROUGH     How can Christians learn best how to hate sin?

                     "They [His chosen ones] walk the narrow paths on earth; they
                   are purified in the furnace of affliction. They follow Christ
                   through sore conflicts; they endure self-denial and experience
                   bitter disappointments; but their painful experience teaches
                   them the guilt and woe of sin, and they look upon it with abhor-
                   rence. Being partakers of Christ's sufferings, they are destined
                   to be partakers of His glory."—Thoughts From the Mount of

  "Acquaint now thyself with him, and      "This section [Job 38:1 to 42:6]

  "Behold, God is great, and we know    splendour. Job's passionate cry that he
him not" (Job 36:26).                   might confront God is now granted.
                                        He had asked to know the reason for
                                        his suffering and sought to discover
                                        God's charges against him. Above all,
                                        he sought to have God vindicate his
                                        innocence and his spiritual integrity.
                                        This, as xl11.7f [ch. 42] shows, Job
                                        achieves. The friends are rebuked and
                                        Job's rectitude acknowledged. Before
                                        Job and his companions, God unfolds
                                        the vast panorama of creation. . . .

                                        futile it is for man to think he can ever

                                        God's moral government of the
                                        universe. His tormenting questions
                                        have not been answered. But he has

                                        affirming his integrity, he attains
                                         spiritual victory and triumphant

           Part 1      Under what circumstance did God speak to Job?
       THE VOICE
 FROM THE STORM        "Out of the storm the Lord spoke to Job" (Job 38:1, TEV).

                        When God communicates directly with man, He sometimes
                     chooses to reveal Himself in some kind of phenomenon beyond
                     man's control. For example, at Sinai the mountain "was al-
                     together on a smoke ... : and the smoke thereof ascended as the
                     smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly" (Ex.
                     19:18). In Job's case, the storm is described in the final speech
                     of Elihu. Read Job 37:1-4.
                        There are thunder and lightning, snow and rain (verse 6).
                     These phenomena cause men to pause in their work and marvel
                     at the greatness of God. Men know that they are helpless before
                     the forces of nature. How much more puny are they before the
                     power of the God who created all nature!
                        Elihu paints a glorious picture of earth and sky before and
                     after a thunderstorm (Job 37:21), and then he goes on to refer to
                     the God who reigns above all nature. To Him all men should turn
                     in reverence and awe (verses 22-24).

                       What rebuke did Jesus give to the weather forecasters of
                     His day? Matt. 16:1-4. '

                       It is always amazing how leaders, even religious leaders, can
                     be sensitive to physical phenomena and blind to spiritual is-
                     sues. They know how to maneuver themselves into favorable
                     positions by watching political trends or sociological move-
                     ments, and yet they are unaware of their responsibilities under
                     God. They can help people materially but not spiritually.

THINK IT THROUGH       Why is God's speaking through nature more effective for
                     some people than any other kind of approach?

                        "God is speaking to us in these last days. We hear His voice in
                     the storm, in the rolling thunder. We hear of the calamities He
                     permits in the earthquakes, the breaking forth of waters, and the
                     destructive elements sweeping all before them. We hear of
                     ships going down in the tempestuous ocean; God speaks to
                     families who have refused to recognize Him, sometimes in the
                     whirlwind and storm, sometimes face to face as He talked with
                     Moses."—Selected Messages, bk. 2, pp. 315, 316.
                        God's voice doesn't always come out of the whirlwind.
                        "Again He whispers His love to the little trusting child and to
                     the gray-haired sire. . . .
                        "When the still small voice which succeeds the whirlwind ...
                     is heard, let all cover their face, for God is very near."—Selected

Getting Acquainted With God            LESSON 8                          Monday
                                                                       August 18
          Part 2     By what questions does God emphasize His greatness
   THE CREATOR     compared with man's littleness?
  OF THE WORLD
                     "Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?
                   declare, if thou hast understanding. Who hath laid the mea-
                   sures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line
                   upon it? Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or
                   who laid the corner stone thereof; when the morning stars
                   sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?" (Job
                   38:4-7).

                      In describing the creation of the world, God used metaphors
                   that would be understood in Job's day. Thus reference is made
                   to a "foundation" being laid, the use of measuring rods and
                   lines, the underpinning of foundation stones and cornerstones,*
                   This does not mean that the earth has a foundation except in the
                   sense that it is as firmly positioned as any building on earth that
                   has a firm foundation. Metaphors must not be used to limit
                   one's understanding and set up a false view of the universe.
                      "As the earth came forth from the hand of its Maker, it was
                   exceedingly beautiful. Its surface was diversified with moun-
                   tains, hills, and plains, interspersed with noble rivers and lovely
                   lakes.... Graceful shrubs and delicate flowers greeted the eye
                   at every turn. The heights were crowned with trees more majes-
                   tic than any that now exist. The air, untainted by foul miasma,
                   was clear and healthful. The entire landscape outvied in beauty
                   the decorated grounds of the proudest palace. The angelic host
                   viewed the scene with delight, and rejoiced at the wonderful
                   works of God."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 44.

                     Before God spoke, what truth did Job already know? Job
                   9:8-10. Why do you think God revealed Himself to Job as He
                   did?

THINK IT THROUGH       Why do we need to be reminded of God's greatness in
                   Creation?

                     Job, in his suffering, had become acutely aware of his pain-
                   racked body, of the garbage dump which was his temporary
                   home, of the accusations of his friends, of the losses of those
                   things that had made life pleasant for him in the past. It was
                   necessary for him to lift his eyes above and beyond his sordid
                   surroundings to God and His creation. A glimpse of the great-
                   ness of God changed his perspective. He ceased complaining.
                   He accepted his lot before he understood the reasons for his
                   misfortunes.
                     We need to look beyond the follies of men of cl Satan who
                   pollute our world and get a new vision of Him who created our
                   world.

              Part 3   What further questions does God ask that show Job how
          THE LORD limited his capacities are?
            OF THE
          UNIVERSE     "Can you tie the Pleiades together
                          or loosen the bonds that hold Orion?
                       Can you guide the stars season by season
                          and direct the Big and the Little Dipper?
                       Do you know the laws that govern the skies,
                          and can you make them apply to the earth?" (Job 38:31-
                     33, TEV).

                       The questions do not only point out how small man is; they
                     indicate the greatness of God. God is above and beyond the
                     universe, and He holds it all together.
                       "Nothing can happen in any part of the universe without the

                       For what two attributes does the psalmist extol God in
                     Psalm 145:3-8?

THINK IT THROUGH       Why is it beneficial to ponder the greatness of God?

                        William Beebe, a naturalist, tells the following story about
                     Theodore Roosevelt:
                        "After an evening talk, perhaps about the fringes of knowl-
                     edge, or some new possibility of climbing into the minds or
                     senses of animals, we would go out on the lawn where we took
                     turns in an amusing little astronomical rite. We searched until
                     we found, with or without our glasses, the faint heavenly spot of
                     light-mist beyond the lower left-hand corner of the great square

                                                                    August 20
          Part 4     How does God demonstrate that He is the Sustainer of life?
       THE LORD
         OF LIFE     "Do you find food for lions to eat,
                       and satisfy hungry young lions
                       when they hid in their caves,
                       or lie in wait in their dens?
                     Who is it that feeds the ravens
                       when they wander about hungry,
                       when their young cry to me for food?" (Job 38:39-41, TEV).

                      God's conversation with Job not only touches the areas of
                   astronomy, geology, and physics—He also presents Himself as
                   the great Zoologist. In the wisdom literature of the Bible, much
                   is said about nature, including the habits and characteristics of
                   animal life. God establishes His position as the Creator and
                   Maintainer of the life that inhabits the world and the universe.
                   He talks to Job about lions, ravens, mountain goats, donkeys,
                   ostriches, horses, hawks, and eagles. in all of this Job is led to
                   see the power, the knowledge, and the concern of the God
                   whose love he had been tempted to doubt.
                      This concept was not new to Job. He had said:
                      "Even birds and animals have much they could teach you;
                         ask the creatures of earth and sea for their wisdom.
                      All of them know that the Lord's hand made them.
                      It is God who directs the lives of his creatures;
                         every man's life is in his power" (Job 12:7-10, TEV).
                      God was endeavoring to remind Job of the lesson that ap-
                   pears in the last stanza of William Cullen Bryant's familiar poem,
                   "To a Waterfowl":
                          "He who, from zone to zone,
                      Guides through the boundless sky thy certain flight,
                      In the long way that I must tread alone,
                          Will lead my steps aright."

THINK IT THROUGH     Why is it foolish of us to worry about the future?

                     "When we take into our hands the management of things with
                   which we have to do, and depend upon our own wisdom for
                   success, we are taking a burden which God has not given us,
                   and are trying to bear it without His aid.... BLit when we really
                   believe that God loves us and means to do us good we shall
                   cease to worry about the future. We shall trust God as a child
                   trusts a loving parent. Then our troubles and torments will
                   disappear, for our will is swallowed up in the will of God."—

Getting Acquainted With God            LESSON 8                     ❑ Thursday
                                                                     August 21
            Part 5   What contrast between God and man is highlighted in Job
      THE SOURCE 40:9?
     OF STRENGTH
                     "Nast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a
                   voice like him?"

                      The security of man is dependent on the strength of God. This
                   Job needed to recognize in order that he might endure his
                   suffering without descending into despair.
                      "In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, I beseech the people
                   of God to depend upon the Lord for strength. Beware how you
                   place men where God should be. We are not safe in taking men
                   as our authority or our guide, for they will surely disappoint us.
                   Individually, we are to work out our own salvation with fear and
                   trembling, 'for it is God which worketh in you both to will and to
                   do of His good pleasure.' We have a high calling in Christ Jesus;
                   we are carrying forward a vast and holy work, and God calls
                   upon each one to uplift His standard in the sight of this world
                   and of the universe of heaven, by the power of the Lord Jehovah,
                   in whom is 'everlasting strength.' "—Testimonies to Ministers,
                   p. 386.

                     What does the Bible tell us about depending on God's
                   strength? Ps. 46:1-3; Jer. 16:19; Ex. 15:2; 1 Chron. 16:11; Eph.
                   3:14-16.
                      We need never fear the elements around us because God is
                   greater than any hurricane or earthquake or flood of water.
                   Nothing can harm us unless God permits.
                      Jeremiah says that he can always go to God for protection and
                   find all the help that he needs.
                      After the destruction of the Egyptian armies, Moses and the
                   children of Israel sang a song of victory in which they attributed
                   their salvation to God.
                      David exhorts the people to find their strength in God be-
                   cause God is the only source of real strength.
                      Paul prays for the church members in Ephesus to be
                   strengthened where they need strength most, in their spiritual
                   lives and in their inner beings.

THINK IT THROUGH     Why are so many Christians weak when they ought to be
                   strong?

                      "Christ knows the strength of your temptations and the strength
                   of your power to resist. His hand is always stretched out in pity-
                   ing tenderness to every suffering child. To the tempted, discour-
                   aged one he says, Child for whom I suffered and died, cannot

                                                                      August 22
          Part 6     For what did Job repent in his response to God?
  JOB RESPONDS
        TO GOD       "Job answered the Lord, and said, I know that thou canst do
                   every thing, and that no thought can be witholden from thee.
                   Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore
                   have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for
                   me, which I knew not. Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I
                   will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me. I have heard of
                   thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee.
                   Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes" (Job
                   42:1-6).
                      Job has at last reached the top rung of the long ladder from
                   despair to confidence. Now he has a more realistic view of both
                   himself and of God.
                      In Job's response to God we notice three things:
                      1. Job has come to recognize the sovereignty of God (verse
                   2). The Seventh-day Adventist Church Manual includes a refer-
                   ence to God as "the Eternal Father, a personal, spiritual Being,
                   omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient, infinite in wisdom and
                   love."—Page 32. Never should a Christian compromise his con-
                   cept of God as Supreme Ruler of the universe.
                      2. Job recognizes the ignorance of man (verse 3). When Job
                   admitted that he said things he didn't understand, he did not yet
                   know why he was being allowed to suffer. But he was coming to
                   the place where he was willing to trust. We all need to be aware
                   of our lack of knowledge, of insight, of understanding. Only
                   when we humble ourselves can we establish a workable rela-
                   tionship with God.
                      3. Job recognizes the importance of personal experience
                   (verse 5). To know God is one of the major goals of religious
                   experience. This means the development of a sensitivity to the
                   guidance of God, a trust in the wisdom and love of God, and an
                   eagerness for a relationship with God. This experience comes
                   to the sincere person who prays, who meditates, who reads
                   God's word, and who commits himself to God.

THINK IT THROUGH     Why is a heart knowledge of God sometimes better than a
                   head knowledge?
                     This passage may be the most valuable in the book of Job.
                   This is the point at which Job's experience can be translated
                   into a message that will meet an individual's deepest needs.
                   Christian experience at all levels consists of recognizing the
                   greatness and the love of God, feeling one's need and unworth-
                   iness, and discovering a personal experience of relationship
                   with God. It is summed up in the words of Christ, "Come unto
                   me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you
                   rest" (Matt. 11:28).

                                            Our text is one of the most touching
                                          passages in the story of Job. When he
                                          prayed, he was still sitting on the
                                          "garbage dump." His sores were still
                                          festering. None of his losses had yet
                                          been restored. The harsh speeches of
                                          his "friends" still rang in his ears. God
                                          had appeared to-him, but He did not
                                          explain the reason for Job's affliction.
                                          There had been no solution offered to
                                          the problem of pain except a renewal
                                          of faith in God'nd a willingness to do
                                          His bidding.
                                            In this key passage regarding the
                                          outcome of Job's, experience is
                                          revealed a principle of the everlasting
                                          gospel taught by.Jesus in His model
                                          prayer: "Forgive us the wrongs we
                                          have done, as We forgive‘the wrongs
                                          that others have done to us" (Matt.
                                          6:12, TEV). Later in His ministry, He
                                          told the story of the servant who was
                                          forgiven "ten thousand talents," but
                                          who refused to forgive his fellow
                                          servant a small debt. (See Matt.
                                          18:23-35.) Intercessory prayer is one of
                                          the themes of the Bible.

            Part 1     Why was God displeased with Job's friends?
           GOD'S
     DISPLEASURE       "After the Lord had spoken these words unto Job, the Lord
                     said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee,
                     and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me the
                     thing that is right, as my servant Job hath" (Job 42:7).

                        "This verse begins the closing prose portion of the book. God
                     turns His attention to the three friends of Job, addressing
                     Eliphaz apparently as the leader of the trio. God had rebuked
                     Job for his lack of understanding, but He indicates anger at the
                     friends for their failure to speak that which was 'right.' This
                     raises the interesting question of the difference between the
                     errors of Job and the errors of his friends. An analysis discloses
                     that Job erred because of suffering, pressure, discouragement,
                     and despair. He was the victim of a distressing situation that he
                     could not understand. His statements were sometimes petulant,
                     sometimes almost sacrilegious. However, all the way through
                     he maintained a basic trust in God. The friends were not suffer-
                     ing as Job was. Their wrong words were the expression of a
                     false philosophy. They allowed tradition to overshadow sym-
                     pathy. They felt that they were justified in harshness because
                     their conception of God seemed to demand such an
                     attitude."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 611.

                        What reason does Paul give for his warning against decep-
                     tion? Eph. 5:6; Col. 2:8.

                      False doctrine leads to a false concept of God and the real
                     world that we are in, and it leads to destruction. God does not
                     want anyone destroyed, and He has poured out all heaven for
                     man's salvation. Therefore He can only hate all deception.

THINK IT THROUGH       What are some areas of deception that have been revealed
                     in my experience?

                        Perhaps our mistakes, like those of Job's friends, are based
                     on traditions that, though deeply rooted, are not in harmony
                     with truth. Perhaps our mistakes are results of incorrect in-
                     terpretation of inspired writings. Possibly we have failed to
                     sense the real meaning of God's messages. Possibly we have
                     taken them out of context and have arrived at unsound conclu-
                     sions. In so doing, we, like Job's friends, may be more
                     blameworthy than others who may crumple under temptation
                     and trial.
                        Never should we fail to be gentle to those who suffer. Job's
                     friends failed on this point. God's gentleness toward Job, as
                     reflected in this chapter, is an example for all of us to follow.
                     (See James 3:17.)

A Happy Ending       LESSON 9                                         ❑ Monday
                                                                      August 25
          Part 2     Who was to pray for Job's friends?
  INTERCESSORY
        PRAYER       "Take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go
                   to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering;
                   and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept"
                   (Job 42:8).

                      Job's prayer of intercession for his friends followed a burnt
                   offering of confession offered by those friends. At God's direc-
                   tion, the friends confessed, sealing their confession with an
                   offering. Also at God's direction, Job prayed for his friends'
                   forgiveness. Only when the friends reached the point in their
                   experience when they could confess, could God forgive; and
                   only when Job reached the point where he could with love and
                   sincerity pray for his friends could God turn his captivity and
                   make him prosperous again.

                     What kind of persons must we be to offer effective prayers?
                   James 5:16.

                     This passage in James must be understood in the context of
                   James's instruction regarding praying for the sick. Such prayer,
                   to be effective, must presuppose that both the sick person and
                   those praying for him should seek forgiveness from one another
                   as well as from God.
                     "Great character is essential to great praying. A man with a
                   small, mean, self-indulgent life cannot genuinely offer a noble
                   prayer. This is the meaning of the saying that it is easy to commit
                   the Lord's Prayer to memory, but difficult to learn it by heart. In
                   any man's entreaty, no matter how great the words, only that
                   much is real which is the expression of his character, the inward
                   quality and habitual desire of his life."—Harry Emerson Fos-
                   dick, The Meaning of Prayer (New York: Association Press,
                   1972), p. 132.

THINK IT THROUGH     How can we be sure our prayers of intercession are really
                   sincere?

                      "We go through the form of praying for our friends. It seems
                   the right thing to do, and it gives us at least a momentary glow of
                   unselfishness. But the prayer does not so rise from a controlling
                   desire for our friends' good, that we can be counted on all that
                   day to be thoughtful about their needs, sensitive to their feel-
                   ings, generous to their faults, glad of their success, and helpful
                   to our utmost in their service. We often do not really care
                   enough about our friends, so that our supplication for them has
                   vital meaning for us and, therefore, for God."—Harry Emerson

A Happy Ending          LESSON 9                                        ❑ Tuesday
                                                                         August 26
              Part 3   How did people respond to Job after his fortunes were
          THE LOVE restored?
         OF FAMILY
       AND FRIENDS     "Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his
                     sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before,
                     and did eat bread with him in his house; and they bemoaned
                     him, and comforted him over all the evil that the Lord had
                     brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money,
                     and every one an earring of gold" (Job 42:11).

                         This passage deserves more attention than it has ordinarily
                      received. It reveals to us how the presence of family and friends
                      contributed to the rebuilding of Job's life.
                         "Job 42:11 presents a peace feast in Job's behalf. In harmony
                      with Middle Eastern custom friends and relatives have held
                      aloof during his trials, fearing to befriend one under divine
                      curse lest they share in the curse. Now, convinced of God's
                      goodwill toward Job, they gather in his house to eat bread with
                      him, to sympathize, and to extend financial aid."—Paul T.
                      Gibbs, Job and the Mysteries of Wisdom, p. 159.
                        The most acute suffering that Job endured was not the loss of
                      his wealth or even his health, but the loss of his children. When
                      the family circle was broken, Job's heart was also broken. The
                      support of his brothers and sisters and acquaintances was a
                      real turning point in his restoration. The later birth of sons and
                      daughters helped even more to heal the deep wounds that
                      adversity had inflicted upon him.

THINK IT THROUGH        What does Job's experience teach us about the importance
                      of the family?

                        "Our sphere of influence may seem narrow, our ability small,
                     our opportunities few, our acquirements limited; yet wonderful
                     possibilities are ours through a faithful use of the opportunities
                     of our own homes. If we will open our hearts and homes to the
                     divine principles of life, we shall become channels for currents
                     of life-giving power. From our homes will flow streams of heal-
                     ing, bringing life, and beauty, and fruitfulness where now are
                     barrenness and dearth."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 355.
                        There are many confused, discouraged people in our world
                     whose lives would be different if they had the support of a loving
                     and concerned family. When Paul wrote to the Colossians and
                     the Ephesians, he specifically addressed wives, husbands, chil-
                     dren, and servants. The state of the church is dependent upon
                     the state of the home. The effectiveness of the Christian witness
                     is determined by the integrity of the Christian home.

A Happy Ending       LESSON 9                                   ❑ Wednesday
                                                                   August 27
          Part 4     What was the source of Job's renewed prosperity?
       THE GOD
  WHO RESTORES        "The Lord turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his
                   friends: also the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had
                   before" (Job 42:10).

                      The restoration of Job not only brought happiness to Job, it
                   also brought happiness to God. It is noteworthy that God not
                   only restored what Job had lost, He doubled Job's blessings.
                   This is the kind of God that Christ reveals.
                      "The Scriptures reveal many facets of God's character, but
                   nothing can take the place of a life that demonstrates it. It was
                   for this purpose that the Son of God came to this earth. When
                   friends were in sorrow over the loss of a loved one, 'Jesus wept'
                   (John 11:35). He wept over the city of Jerusalem (Luke 19:41).
                   (Here the word klaid is used, which indicates a loud expression
                   of grief, especially in mourning for the dead.) This was God:
                   moved with sympathy for the mourners and silently shedding
                   tears, and a few weeks later broken up within because
                   Jerusalem had rejected Him, and weeping as one mourning for
                   the dead.
                      "When the adulterous woman was brought before Him, He
                   said compassionately, 'Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin
                   no more' (John 8:11). This too was God. He spoke to the Samari-
                   tan woman at the well, and converted her and numerous other
                   Samaritans—with whom the Jews would have no dealings. This
                   is God's way. He had compassion on the multitude when they
                   were hungry (Matt. 15:32), because they fainted and were scat-
                   tered abroad as sheep without a shepherd (Matt. 9:35, 36;
                   14:14). Thus was the heart of God revealed.
                      "He was the fearless defender of right. When the Pharisees
                   sought to frighten Him into precipitous flight by warning Him
                    that Herod would kill Him, 'He said unto them, Go ye, and tell
                    that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and I do cures to day and to
                    morrow, and the third day I shall be perfected' (Luke 13:32).
                    When greedy priests and hucksters were defiling the Temple He
                    made a scourge of cords, overturned the tables of the
                    moneychangers, and drove them all out (Matt. 21:12, 13; Mark
                    11:15-17; John 2:14-17). This also was God."—Otto H. Christen-

                    and Herald Publishing Association, 1970), pp. 64, 65.

                     "The character of God, whose likeness we are to receive, is

                                                                           August 28
              Part 5     "The Lord blessed the latter end of Job more than his be-
              JOB'S    ginning" (Job 42:12).
        BEST YEARS
                         "'The Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind' (Job 38:1),
                       and revealed to His servant the might of His power. When Job
                       caught a glimpse of his Creator, he abhorred himself and re-
                       pented in dust and ashes. Then the Lord was able to bless him
                       abundantly and to make his last years the best of his life."—
                       Prophets and Kings, p. 164. (Emphasis supplied.)

                         How could Job's last years have been the best when he had
                       lost so much and suffered so much?

                          1. He had laid a sound character foundation in his earlier
                       years. He had been faithful to God, to his family, and to his
                       fellowmen. His last years did not have to be filled with regrets.
                          2. He had survived a great ordeal. The book of Job is a story of
                       spiritual survival. The struggle wasn't easy, but with God's help
                       the victory was won.
                          3. He had come to know God better. In fact, the story turns on
                       the growing maturity of Job's acquaintance with God. His
                       knowledge of God was not a mere emotional reaction. It was a
                       deep, profound understanding of God as his Creator, Friend,
                       and Redeemer.
                          4. He had enjoyed the great experience of being forgiven.
                       Many of his statements were expressions of despair rather than
                       hope. Many of his accusations against God revealed lack of
                       understanding. But God never rejected Job despite his discour-
                       agement.
                          5. Job had been vindicated. No doubt he often repeated his
                       story to his seven sons and his three beautiful daughters. It may
                       have been these children that helped preserve Job's story until
                       it could eventually be written for posterity. It is of passing inter-
                       est that the only names preserved in the book besides those of
                       the main actors are the names of Job's daughters.

THINK IT THROUGH         How can we become like Job?

                         Perfection is the process by which a great and loving God
                       calls people to follow Him, forgives their sins, helps them to

A Happy Ending       LESSON 9                                            ❑ Friday
                                                                         August 29
          Part 6   "After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his
        "SO JOB sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations. So Job died,
          DIED" being old and full of days" (Job 42:16, 17).

                      "The man who was so sure that the grave was just ahead of
                   him continued to live for nearly another century and a half! The
                   life that had seemed blasted, bloomed again in greater bril-
                   liance than before. The blessings.that had seemed to be gone
                   forever, returned, more wonderful than ever. Property, family,
                   friends, reputation, were his again. But even greater than these
                   blessings was the memory of an experience in which he had
                   come face to face with God, and had learned lessons more
                   valuable than material possessions. These lessons, God in His
                   providence saw fit to share with all humanity, and so the book of
                   Job was preserved as one of the great spiritual heritages from a
                   far-distant past. It is our privilege today to learn from the experi-
                   ence of Job lessons of trust and confidence in God."—S.D.A.
                   Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 612.

                    Although death is humanity's lot, what is God's purpose for
                   man? John 11:25, 26.

                      Regarding almost every person, good or bad, who has lived
                   upon this earth, the final line could read like that of Job, "So he
                   died." But God is not the author of death. God's eternal purpose
                   is that all who believe will not perish but have everlasting life.
                   Job saw a glimmer of light beyond the grave. We may anticipate
                   the future in the full light of the gospel.
                      "In Christ is life, original, unborrowed, underived. 'He that
                   hath the Son hath life.' 1 John 5:12. The divinity of Christ is the
                   believer's assurance of eternal life. 'He that believeth in Me,'
                   said Jesus, 'though he were dead, yet shall he live: and
                   whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die. Believest
                   thou this?' Christ here looks forward to the time of His second
                   coming. Then the righteous dead shall be raised incorruptible,
                   and the living righteous shall be translated to heaven without
                   seeing death. The miracle which Christ was about to perform, in
                   raising Lazarus from the dead, would represent the resurrection
                   of all the righteous dead. By His word and His works He declared
                   Himself the Author of the resurrection. He who Himself was
                   soon to die upon the cross stood with the keys of death, a
                   conqueror of the grave, and asserted His right and power to give
                   eternal life."—The Desire of Ages, p. 530.

          Part 1     How did God respond to the afflictions of Israel?
      GOD FEELS
       OUR PAIN      "In all their affliction he was afflicted" (I sa. 63:9).

                       Isaiah pictures a God who is in close touch with His people,
                    responding to their needs in various ways, sometimes judging
                    them, but always loving them and seeking their best interests
                    (verses 11-14).
                       "As a kind, loving parent suffers when suffering comes upon
                    his children, so does God. The Lord saw the affliction of His
                    people in Egypt (Ex. 3:16) and saved them when they cried to
                    Him in their oppression. Today He is our great high priest, who
                    is 'touched with the feeling of our infirmities' (Neb. 4:15)."—
                   S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 4, p. 324.
                       "Jesus Himself never purchased peace by compromise. His
                   heart overflowed with love for the whole human race, but He
                    was never indulgent to their sins. He was too much their friend
                    to remain silent while they were pursuing a course that would
                    ruin their souls. . . .
                       " ... Not a sigh is breathed, not a pain felt, not a grief pierces
                   the soul, but the throb vibrates to the Father's heart. . . .
                       " . . . God is bending from His throne to hear the cry of the
                    oppressed. To every sincere prayer He answers, 'Here am I.' He
                   uplifts the distressed and downtrodden. In all our afflictions He
                   is afflicted. In every temptation and every trial the angel of His
                    presence is near to deliver."—The Desire of Ages, p. 356. (Em-
                    phasis supplied.)

                     How did God respond to Israel's bondage in Egypt? Ex.
                   2:23-25.

THINK IT THROUGH     How can we be sure that the Christian never suffers alone?

                      "The cross is a revelation to our dull senses of the pain that,
                   from its very inception, sin has brought to the heart of God.
                   Every departure from the right, every deed of cruelty, every
                   failure of humanity to reach His ideal, brings grief to Him. When
                   there came upon Israel the calamities that were the sure result
                   of separation from God,—subjugation by their enemies, cruelty,
                   and death,—it is said that 'His soul was grieved for the misery of
                   Israel.' In all their affliction He was afflicted: . . . and He bare
                   them, and carried them all the days of old.' Judges 10:16; Isaiah
                   63:9."—Education, p. 263.
                      One of the great blessings of the Christian faith is the knowl-
                   edge that the Christian serves a sympathizing, caring God. It is
                   comforting to know that there is not a pang of pain on earth that
                   is not shared in heaven. God suffers with His earthbound chil-
                   dren.

                                                                    September 1
         Parl 2      What assurance did God give captive Judah?
         GOD'S
      PRESENCE       "When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee;
                   and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when
                   thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned;
                   neither shall the flame kindle upon thee. For I am the Lord thy
                   God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour" (Isa. 43:2, 3).

                      The companionship of God is one of the themes of the Scrip-
                   tures. While God's servant enjoys his Master's companionship
                   during life's sunny days, the sense of God's nearness is espe-
                   cially appreciated when things go hard.
                      The psalmist said, "Yea, though I walk through the valley of
                   the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me" (Ps.
                   23:4).
                      Paul said his God was "not far from every one of us: for in him
                   we live, and move, and have our being" (Acts 17:27, 28).
                      One of the names given to Jesus was Immanuel, which means
                   "God with us."
                      The doctrine of the Holy Spirit teaches us of the companion-
                   ship of God under all circumstances and in all conditions.
                      The letter to the Hebrews quotes God as saying, "I will never
                   leave thee, nor forsake thee" (Heb. 13:5). Therefore, the Chris-
                   tian may boldly say, "The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear
                   what man shall do unto me" (verse 6).

                     What was the meaning to the Israelites of the pillar of fire?
                   Ex. 13:21, 22.

                      During every day of 40 difficult years there was a pillar of
                   cloud over the camp of Israel, and during the night a pillar of
                   fire. Under all sorts of stresses, conflicts, apostasies, and disap-
                   poi ntments, He was there. During these weary years God proved
                   Himself a God who was interested in people—immature people,
                   repulsive people, helpless people, people who didn't appreciate
                   Him. He provided for these people, supplying their necessities
                   and protecting them from their enemies.

THINK IT THROUGH     How can pain deepen our Christian experience?

                      Christians have often found the richest experience of their
                   lives in times of great pain and perplexity because they have
                   come to sense the nearness of God.
                           "I rest beneath Thy kindly shade;
                              My griefs expire, my-troubles cease;
                          Thou, Lord, on whom my soul is stayed,
                              Wilt keep me still in perfect peace."

            Part 3     How were God's chosen people protected?
       GOD HELPS
     AND DELIVERS      "Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him,
                     upon them that hope in his mercy; to deliver their soul from
                     death, and to keep them alive in famine. Our soul waiteth for

                     (Ps. 33:18-22).

                       "Our God has heaven and earth at His command, and He
                     knows just what we need. We can see only a little way before us;

                     which His providence sees best."—Testimonies, vol. 8, pp. 272,
                     273.

                       What assurance did Peter give to suffering Christians?
                     1 Peter 3:12-14.

                       Pain and suffering sometimes result from the hostility of
                     those who hate God and His people. This was especially obvi-
                     ous in Peter's time, but Peter recognized the keeping power of
                     God in times of stress and persecution.

                       Why may we approach God with confidence in time of need?
                     Heb. 4:14-16.

                       "Keep your life free from love of money, and be content with
                     what you have; for he has said, 'I will never fail you nor forsake
                     you.' Hence we can confidently say,
                            'The Lord is my helper,
                            I will not be afraid;
                            what can man do to me?' " (Heb. 13:5, 6, RSV).

THINK IT THROUGH       What close relation is there between confidence in God and
                     recovery from sickness?

                       "Because God's love is so great and so unfailing, the sick
                     should be encouraged to trust in Him and be cheerful. To be
                     anxious about themselves tends to cause weakness and dis-
                     ease. If they will rise above depression and gloom, their pros-
                     pect of recovery will be better."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 229.

The Problem of Pain        LESSON 10                              ❑ Wednesday
                                                                   September 3
         Part 4   In an illustration referring to members of the body, what
       HELPING close relationship does Paul teach exists between the mem-
    ONE ANOTHER bers of the church?

                     "If one member suffers, all suffer together; if one member is
                   honored, all rejoice together" (1 Cor. 12:26, RSV).

                     There are at least three phases in the mission of the church:
                   (1) to carry the gospel to the world; (2) to provide for the worship
                   of God, and (3) to provide Christian fellowship. This fellowship
                   involves more than seeing each other on Sabbath mornings; it
                   also includes such a complete identification of one church
                   member with another that "if one member suffers, all suffer
                   together."
                     It is comforting to know that if some accident or illness should
                   befall me, my brothers and sisters in the church would be
                   concerned. If some great crisis should occur in my life, my
                   church would have words of comfort. God has ordained this
                   caring function of the church.

                     What is James's definition of true religion? James 1:27.

THINK IT THROUGH     Why is it important for Christians to have the poor and
                   suffering in their midst?

                      "God has placed among us the poor, the unfortunate, the
                   sick, and the suffering. They are Christ's legacy to His church,
                   and they are to be cared for as He would care for them. In this
                   way God takes away the dross and purifies the gold, giving us
                   that culture of heart and character which we need. . . .
                      "In placing among us the poor and the suffering, the Lord is
                   testing us to reveal to us what is in our hearts. We cannot with
                   safety swerve from principle, we cannot violate justice, we can-
                   not neglect mercy. When we see a brother falling into decay we
                   are not to pass him by on the other side, but are to make decided
                   and immediate efforts to fulfil the word of God by helping him....
                      "It should be written upoli the conscience as with a pen of
                   iron upon a rock, that he who disregards mercy, compassion,
                   and righteousness, he who neglects the poor, who ignores the
                   needs of suffering humanity, who is not kind and courteous, is
                   so conducting himself that God cannot co-operate with him in
                   the development of character."—Testimonies, vol. 6, pp. 261,
                   262.
                      In Romans 12:15 Paul said, "Rejoice with them that do re-
                   joice, and weep with them that weep." God has given us a part in
                   solving the problem of pain. The encouraging word, the sooth-
                   ing touch, the unselfish ministry—these are God's appointed
                   means of lightening the burdens of life.

The Problem of Pain         LESSON 10                                 ❑ Thursday
                                                                      September 4
           Part 5     What is Paul's description of his experience with hardship?
       PAIN WITH
        COURAGE       "We are hard-pressed on all sides, but we are never frus-
                    trated; we are puzzled, but never in despair. We are perse-
                    cuted, but are never deserted: we may be knocked down but
                    we are never knocked out!" (2 Cor. 4:8, 9, Phillips).
                      "To the present hour we hunger and thirst, we are ill-clad
                    and buffeted and homeless, and we labor, working with our
                    own hands. When reviled, we bless; when persecuted, we
                    endure; when slandered, we try to conciliate" (1 Cor. 4:11-13,
                    RSV).

                       The Christian understands the reason for pain and suffering.
                    He knows there will be an ultimate solution.
                       Through pain—His own, His Son's, His people's—it became
                    clear that "God with man was working out the world's redemp-
                    tion, and that there was no other way; that, in a sense, the
                    endless moan of man's pain was the song of a world being
                    redeemed, a sad song as yet, but still music, working toward
                    some worthy and wondrous climax beyond all human capability
                    of thought."—Leslie D. Weatherhead, Why Do Men Suffer?
                    (New York: The Abingdon Press, 1936), p. 12.

                      Why does the Christian face pain with courage? 2 Cor. 2:14.

                      Further, the Christian understands that "evil must be permit-
                    ted to come to maturity. For the good of the entire universe
                    through ceaseless ages Satan must more fully develop his prin-
                    ciples, that his charges against the divine government might be
                    seen in their true light by all created beings, that the justice and
                    mercy of God and the immutability of His law might forever be
                    placed beyond all question."—The Great Controversy, p. 499.

THINK IT THROUGH      What examples and principles enable the Christian to en-
                    dure trials and suffering?

                       "God's chosen servants should meet with courage and pa-
                    tience the trials and sufferings that befall them ... , ever remem-
                    bering that the prophets of old and the Saviour of mankind and
                    His apostles also endured abuse and persecution for the Word's
                    sake."—Prophets and Kings, p. 437.
                       "Christian life is more than many take it to be. It does not
                    consist wholly in gentleness, patience, meekness, and kindli-
                    ness. These graces are essential; but there is need also of
                    courage, force, energy, and perseverance. The path that Christ
                    marks out is a narrow, self-denying path. To enter that path and
                    press on through difficulties and discouragements requires
                    men who are more than weaklings."—The Ministry of Healing,

The Problem of Pain        LESSON 10                                   ❑ Friday
                                                                    September 5
          Part 6     What promise is given to the redeemed?
           PAIN
       WILL END      "God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there
                   shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither
                   shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed
                   away" (Rev. 21:4).

                     "Pain cannot exist in the atmosphere of heaven. There will be
                   no more tears, no funeral trains, no badges of mourning. . . .
                   'The inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell
                   therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.' .. . Isaiah 33:24."—The
                   Great Controversy, p. 676.
                     "From India, from Africa, from China, from the islands of the
                   sea, from the downtrodden millions of so-called Christian
                   lands, the cry of human woe is ascending to God. That cry will
                   not long be unanswered."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 179.

                     What did Paul conclude from a comparison of life in the
                   present and that in the kingdom? Rom. 8:18-21.

                      Phillips translates verse 19 thus: "The whole creation is on
                   tiptoe to see the wonderful sight of the sons of God coming into
                   their own."
                      "In all ages Satan has persecuted the people of God. He has
                   tortured them and put them to death, but in dying they become
                   conquerors. They bore witness to the power of One mightier
                   than Satan. Wicked men may torture and kill the body, but they
                   cannot touch the life that is hid with Christ in God. They can
                   incarcerate men and women in prison walls, but they cannot
                   bind the spirit."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 576.
                      "All that has perplexed us in the providences of God will in the
                   world to come be made plain.... We shall know that infinite love
                   ordered the experiences that seemed most trying. As we realize
                   the tender care of Him who makes all things work together for
                   our good, we shall rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of
                   glory."—Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 286.

THINK IT THROUGH     Why is hope an important characteristic of the Christian?

                      There are many in our world who consider life hopeless,
                   meaningless, absurd. As a result, they live only for the present
                   moment. The theology of the Bible is a theology of hope, and
                   that hope is not limited to the present life. Unending freedom
                   from pain is one of the rewards of the redeemed.
                      Regardless of the pain, suffering, or misfortune that may dog
                   our footsteps, we can with assurance say, "This, too, will pass."
                   And throughout all the checkered experience of life "we know
                   that in everything God works for good with those who love him"
                   (Rom. 8:28, RSV).

                     "The Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and
                  breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a
                  living soul" (Gen. 2:7).

                      "The entire question of God's activity in healing man's body
                   rests on the great truth that God made man's body. If a person is
                   only an accident resulting from the interplay of impersonal
                   forces on this planet, the health of his body may likewise be
                   assumed to depend on purely physical factors. But if God was
                   the designer, it would be logical to believe that He might have a
                   continuing concern for the mechanism He perfected."—Norval
                   Pease, Heal the Sick, p. 4.
                      What provisions has God made for man's health?
                      1. He equipped the body with effective defenses against dis-
                   ease and injury. Germs and viruses are destroyed; wounds heal;
                   broken bones grow together again. Defenses of all sorts are
                   built into the organism to ensure its survival.
                      2. He gave men wisdom and skill in order that man's life
                   might be lengthened and that his suffering might be lessened.
                   Highly trained physicians and surgeons, sophisticated equip-
                   ment and efficient hospitals have brought a new security to
                   millions of people. In all this progress man has merely been
                   discovering and utilizing the resources placed in the world by
                   its Creator to protect His investment in man.
                      3. God created an environment that provided the elements
                   necessary for survival and health. And man was given the intel-
                   ligence to know how to relate to his environment.
                      4. God gave man good reasons to desire to live. One of these
                   reasons was the family. Another was the sense of community
                   among people. The greatest was the revelation of Himself.

THINK IT THROUGH    Is healing a miracle or a provision in nature that God has
                   made?

                      God has made His healing power available to men of faith to
                   meet needs that could not be met by natural resources. His
                   provision might be compared to a man who would invent a
                   complicated machine. After providing satisfactory housing,
                   adequate power source, and skilled operators, he might say, "If
                   it breaks down, let me know. Perhaps I can be of help."
                      God has made a tremendous investment in man. He is inter-
                   ested in the whole man, including his body. He says, "If it breaks
                   down, let me know. I can help."

God the Healer       LESSON 11                                         ❑ Monday
                                                                      September 8
           part 2     What gift in the church indicates that God is interested in
    GOD'S DESIRE    physical health?
         TO HEAL
                      "God hath set some in the church, first apostles, second-
                    arily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts
                    of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues"
                    (1 Cor. 12:28).

                      Is God reluctant to heal? Sometimes it seems to us that this is
                    the case. But there is abundant evidence that God is really
                    anxious to heal. For example, God's concern for the health of
                    Israel indicates His desire that His people shall be free from
                    disease. Also, the large part that healing played in the ministry
                    of Jesus reinforces the same conclusion. Likewise, placing
                    "gifts of healings" in the list of gifts of the Spirit indicates that
                    a healthy body is one of God's priorities for His church.

                      What two actions of God does the psalmist mention to-
                    gether? Ps. 103:3.

                        The psalmist repeats what he knows from the writings of
                    Moses. (See Ex. 15:26.) God had promised the children of Israel
                    that if they kept His commandments He would preserve them
                    from the diseases that had fallen on the Egyptians'
                        It is interesting to note that God not only heals physical ail-
                    ments; He will heal the broken heart, the one whose love life has
                    gone awry. (See Ps. 147:3; compare the work of Jesus in Luke
                    4:18.)
                        We need to sense God's closeness to man. This closeness is
                    described in the Bible by some very expressive figures of
                    speech. "One such figure is the word 'shepherd.' ... [See Psalm
                    23.] How could language express more simply and more beauti-
                    fully the ideal relationship between man and God? And how
                    could the loving care of God be more forcefully described? If
                    God feels that way about us, surely He is concerned about the
                    things that concern us; and health is one of the most important
                    of those things.
                         "Again and again in the New Testament, God is referred to as
                    'Father.' Seventeen times in 'The Sermon of the Mount' and
                    twenty-eight times in John 14 this term is used. We cannot help
                    but understand how God feels about us. He must be concerned
                    about our physical illnesses. Any good father is concerned
                     when one of his children is ill. Surely God is no exception. God
                     has said, 'I will never leave thee nor forsake thee.' [Heb. 13:5.]
                    This message brings encouragement in all kinds of cir-
                     cumstances. It should mean much to those who struggle with
                     illness."—Norval Pease, Heal the Sick, pp. 11, 12.

 THINK IT THROUGH      If God wants to heal, why does He permit sickness?

                                                                           September 9
              Part 3     What is the crucial element in divine healing?
          FAITH AND
            HEALING      "The prayer offered in faith will save the sick man, the Lord
                       will raise him from his bed" (James 5:15, NEB).

                          The healing ministry of Jesus illustrates the place of faith. The
                       healing miracles of Jesus might aptly be called "lessons in
                       faith," for in almost every case faith is mentioned in connection
                       with the miracle of healing. "According to your faith, be it unto
                       you" reflects the criterion Jesus used in imparting His gift of
                       health to mankind.
                          "Christ is the same compassionate physician now that He was
                       during His earthly ministry. In Him there is healing balm for
                       every disease, restoring power for every infirmity. His disciples
                       in this time are to pray for the sick as verily as the disciples of old
                       prayed. And recoveries will follow; for 'the prayer of faith shall
                       save the sick.' We have the Holy Spirit's power, the calm assur-
                       ance of faith, that can claim God's promises. The Lord's prom-
                       ise, 'They shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover'
                       (Mark 16:18), is just as trustworthy now as in the days of the
                       apostles. It presents the privilege of God's children, and our
                       faith should lay hold of all that it embraces. Christ's servants are
                       the channel of His working, and through them He desires to
                       exercise His healing power. It is our work to present the sick and
                       suffering to God in the arms of our faith. We should teach them
                       to believe in the Great Healer."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 226.

                        What important gift did Jesus give His disciples? Matt. 10:1;
                       Mark 6:13; Luke 9:1.

THINK IT THROUGH         What is this "faith" that brings healing?

                           "Some have compared faith to putting money in a bank,
                       trusting that it will be available when needed; to trusting the
                       pilot of an airplane to fly and land his plane safely; or to trusting
                       a surgeon with one's life. Actually, these examples describe
                       reasoning based on evidence. We have observed that bankers,
                       pilots, and surgeons are generally trustworthy, so we feel jus-
                       tified in placing our confidence in them. . . .
                           "But faith is more. . . . Faith is the upraised hand by which we
                       receive the gifts of God. These gifts are varied. They may in-
                       clude forgiveness, strength, insight, salvation, happiness, eter-
                       nal life. The Bible also makes it very clear that one of these gifts,
                       received by faith, is healing."—Norval Pease, Heal the Sick, pp.

         Part 4      How did Jesus respond to a request for healing from two
      LOVE AND     blind men?
       HEALING
                     "Behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they
                   heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on
                   us, 0 Lord, thou Son of David. And the multitude rebuked
                   them, because they should hold their peace: but they cried the
                   more, saying, Have mercy on us, 0 Lord, thou Son of David.
                   And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye
                   that I shall do unto you? They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes
                   may be opened. So Jesus had compassion on them, and
                   touched their eyes: and immediately their eyes received
                   sight, and,they followed him" (Matt. 20:30-34).

                       Jesus healed people because He loved them. His heart was
                   filled with pity and sympathy which found expression in acts of
                   mercy and healing. Note four occasions of compassionate re-
                   sponse: (1) people mourning (Luke 7:13), (2) a man afflicted by
                   leprosy (Mark 1:41), (3) people wandering around like sheep
                   without a shepherd (Matt. 9:36), and (4) hungry people (Matt.
                   15:32).
                       "The power of love was in all Christ's healing, and only by
                   partaking of that love, through faith, can we be instruments for
                   His work."—The Desire of Ages, p. 825.

                     How should Christians react in their contact with other
                   people? Zech. 7:9; Rom. 12:15; 1 Peter 3:8.

                      "Can it be that we ought to change our questions regarding
                   healing? Rather than asking, 'Do I have faith enough?'—which
                   is a good question—perhaps we should ask, 'Do I have love
                   enough?' which may be a better question.
                      "In this context we can see an inherent weakness in public
                   'faith healing' meetings. The 'healer' does not know the line of
                   people who, one by one, are coming to the platform to be
                   healed. Those who seek healing do not personally know the
                   'healer.' ... Any genuine, effective love is hard to imagine under
                   these circumstances. . . .
                      "Whatever the circumstance, the 'elders of the congregation'
                   are more likely to pray with the 'power of love' than would a
                   stranger. God knew what He was doing when He suggested the
                   manner of prayer for the sick. He was concerned that love
                   should be the motivation of prayers for healing."—Norval
                   Pease, Heal the Sick, pp. 20, 21.

THINK IT THROUGH     What is the connection between love, faith, and healing?

                      Love opens the channels for healing. Love urges that some-
                   thing be done. It is God who heals, not love. But love explores
                   every channel that can bring healing and saving health.

                                                                                  93

             Part 5   What is implied in James 5:16 about the importance of the
         GOODNESS character of the person who prays?
       AND HEALING
                      "A good man's prayer is powerful and effective" (James
                    5:16, NEB).

                        "Before engaging in prayer there should be the closest self-
                      examination to discover if there are not sins which need to be
                      repented of, confessed, and forsaken. Deep humility of soul
                      before God is necessary, and firm, humble reliance upon the
                      merits of the blood of Christ alone. Fasting and prayer will
                      accomplish nothing while the heart is estranged from God by a
                     wrong course of action."—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 146.
                        "Great character is essential to great praying. A man with a
                     small, mean, self-indulgent life cannot genuinely offer a noble
                     prayer._ In any man's entreaty, no matter how great the words,
                     only that much is real which is the expression of his character,
                     the inward quality and habitual desire of his life."—Harry Emer-
                     son Fosdick, The Meaning of Prayer, p. 138.
                        What does this tell us about our prayers for the sick?
                        "Some close heart-searching is appropriate before we com-
                     ply with the Biblical command to pray for the sick. Does our
                     conscience tell us that we have personal problems that must be
                     solved before we can presume to ask God to work a miracle? Do
                     we have a sufficiently vital concern about the person who needs
                     healing so that we can pray with real feeling? Do we have the
                     dedication necessary so that God can work through us to ac-
                     complish important things without our seeking the credit for
                     what God does? How deeply is our ego involved in it all? Are we
                     willing to venture in faith, and do we know how to relate to
                     unanswered prayer?
                        "The small amount of healing among Christians may suggest,
                     in part, that we are not yet mature enough to know how to
                     handle such a responsibility. Better people will pray more
                     powerful and effective prayers, and more sick people will be
                     healed."—Norval Pease, Heal the Sick, p. 31.

THINK IT THROUGH       What, then, is the great challenge to the church?

                       Matthew 17 records the experience of nine of Jesus' disciples
                     when they were unable to heal a demon-possessed boy at the
                     foot of the Mount of Transfiguration. Their faith was weak be-

                     they must come to work in a different spirit.. . . They must be

God the Healer       LESSON 11                                         ❑ Friday
                                                                   September 12
           Part 6     What is the source of the gift of healing?
       A GIFT OF
      THE SPIRIT      "Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit."
                      "For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to
                    another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit; to another
                    faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the
                    same Spirit" (1 Cor. 12:4, 8, 9).

                      How does the Holy Spirit work? The Holy Spirit, as described
                    and defined in Scripture, is God the Counselor, Comforter, and
                    Helper of every Christian. God the Father is the Creator and
                    Sustainer; God the Son is the Saviour and Redeemer; God the
                    Holy Spirit is God standing by the side of people.
                      When the Holy Spirit appeared at Pentecost, cloven tongues
                    as of fire sat upon "each of them" (Acts 2:3). This was the
                    beginning of a broader ministry of the Holy Spirit.
                      The work of the Holy Spirit resulted in "love, joy, peace,
                    longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temper- .
                    ance" (Gal. 5:22, 23). In addition to giving character, the Holy
                    Spirit gave mission. This mission is outlined in the gifts of the
                    Spirit, one of which is healing. This ability to restore health is a
                    gift bestowed by the same Holy Spirit who gave other people
                    wisdom, ability to communicate, faith, miraculous powers, and
                    the gift of prophecy.

 THINK IT THOUGH      Does the gift of healing preclude the work of a physician?

                      How may the gift of healing be performed? The New Testament
                    permits us to conclude that this gift of healing was expressed in
                    more than one way. There was Luke, the physician, who ac-
                    companied Paul. Who is to say that he did not possess the gift of
                    healing as well as Peter and John who commanded a lame man
                    to walk? James directed that the elders of the church should
                    pray for the sick man, "anointing him with oil in the name of the
                    Lord." Here is a picture of a common remedy in New Testament
                    times, "oil" being applied by representatives of the church,
                    made effective by "the prayer of faith."
                      The New Testament world had few facilities for the care and
                    healing of the sick. But the "Comforter," who came in harmony
                    with Jesus' promise, was concerned about those who were
                    suffering. There weren't enough physicians like Luke to meet
                    the need, so the Spirit enabled people who were not physicians
                    to perform the healing ministry. The objective was to do away
                    with suffering.
                       What application does this have today? The Spirit still works
                    through natural means to restore health. But the same Spirit
                    may also work through the earnest prayers of Christians to
                    invoke God's healing power.

              Part 1   In our consideration of divine healing, what fact must we
       UNIVERSALITY face?
          OF DEATH
                       "Everyone must die once, and after that be judged by God"
                     (Heb. 9:27, TEV).

                        We must never forget that as long as we are in this world we
                     must accept the hazards that are a part of life in this world. The
                     Christian is subject to accident, disease, and death. With a very
                     few exceptions in history, every person born into this world has
                     died; and most of the inhabitants of this world have known
                     illness to a greater or lesser extent. While the prayers of faith
                     may, at times, result in healing sickness and delaying death, the
                     grim reaper finally takes his toll. God's plan for eternal health
                     and life is dependent on the resurrection into a new life, not on
                     the indefinite continuation of this present life.
                        So far as we know, all the people whom Jesus and the apos-
                     tles raised to life or healed eventually died. Lazarus retraced the
                     pathway to the tomb. Dorcas finally laid down her burdens.
                     Blind Bartimaeus eventually closed his eyes in death.
                        Why are not Christians exempt from sickness and death?
                     When Jesus came to this world to redeem man, He became
                     subject to death. He identified Himself with all of mankind. His
                     followers, likewise, must incur the same limitations of mortality
                     as the rest of mankind; otherwise they could neither properly
                     sympathize or effectively witness. Jesus not only suffered for
                     man; He suffered with man. Christians suffer with the rest of the
                     world, but their suffering is tempered by hope.
                        Think of the millions of "rice Christians- who would storm the
                     gates of the church if Christianity were a guaranteed means of
                     curing all disease and delaying imminent death. It is not God's
                     intention that His kingdom should be advanced in this way.
                     Christians will continue to suffer and die until their Lord comes,
                     but with comfort and hope.

THINK IT THROUGH       How can I rise above misfortune, sickness, and death?

                         "A local preacher was addressing an open-air meeting in
                     Bristol. He was trying to make the point that Christ is the answer
                     to all our problems, and the solution of all our troubles.... Then
                     a great fellow at the back began to heckle, and shouted out. '
                     Go and talk to the unemployed like that, and see what they say.'
                     There was no answer, until a man very near the front stood out
                     and said, '     I am unemployed, and I am very poor, and I have a
                     wife and three children, but if you take Jesus Christ out of my
                     life, I have nothing left. He is greater than my poverty, and I love
                     him.' "—Leslie D. Weatherhead, Why Do Men Suffer? (New

          Part 2     Why should we submit to God's ways and not insist on ours?
     GOD KNOWS
           BEST      "My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways
                   my ways, saith the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than
                   the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my
                   thoughts than your thoughts" (Isa. 55:8, 9).

                      "We all desire immediate and direct answers to our prayers,
                   and are tempted to become discouraged when the answer is
                   delayed or comes in an unlooked-for form. But God is too wise
                   and good to answer our prayers always at just the time and in
                   just the manner we desire. He will do more and better for us than
                   to accomplish all our wishes. And because we can trust His
                   wisdom and love, we should not ask Him to concede to our will,
                   but should seek to enter into and accomplish His purpose. Our
                   desires and interests should be lost in His will. These experi-
                   ences that test faith are for our benefit. By them it is made
                   manifest whether our faith is true and sincere, resting on the
                   word of God alone, or whether depending on circumstances, it
                   is uncertain and changeable. . . .
                      "Not all understand these principles. Many who seek the
                   Lord's healing mercy think that they must have a direct and
                   immediate answer to their prayers or their faith is defective. For
                   this reason, those who are weakened by disease need to be
                   counseled wisely, that they may act with discretion. They should
                   not disregard their duty to the friends who may survive them, or
                   neglect to employ nature's agencies for the restoration of
                   health."—The Ministry of Healing, pp. 230, 231.

                     What should be the prayer of the Christian? Matt. 6:10.

                     How did Jesus set the example of asking that God's will be
                   done? Matt. 26:42.

                      "The consistent course is to commit our desires to our all-
                   wise heavenly Father, and then, in perfect confidence, trust all
                   to Him. We know that God hears us if we ask according to His
                   will. But to press our petitions without a submissive spirit is not
                   right; our prayers must take the form, not of command, but of
                   intercession."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 230.

THINK IT THROUGH     Why are some people afraid of praying, "Thy will be done"?
                   Is it reasonable for us to suppose that God's will for us is
                   different from what we would choose for ourselves if we knew
                   what God knows?

           GOD'S
      UNEXPECTED    "My God shall supply all your need according to his riches in
            WAYS glory by Christ Jesus" (Phil. 4:19).

                       God does nth answer our prayers according to our wants, but
                    according to our real needs. This means that He sometimes
                    answers our prayers in ways we could not anticipate.
                       "St. Augustine pictures his mother, Monica, praying all one
                    night, in a sea-side chapel on the north African coast, that God
                    would not let her son sail for Italy. She wanted Augustine to be a
                    Christian. She could not endure losing him from her influence.
                    If under her care, he was still far from being Christ's, what would
                    he be in Italy, home of licentiousness and splendor, of manifold
                    and alluring temptations? And even while she prayed there
                    passionately for her son's retention at home, he sailed, by the
                    grace of God, for Italy, where, persuaded by Ambrose, he be-
                    came a Christian in the very place from which his mother's
                    prayers would have kept him. The form of her petition was
                    denied; the substance of her desire was granted. As St. Augus-
                    tine himself puts it: 'Thou, in the depth of thy counsels, hearing
                    the main point of her desire, regardest not what she then asked,
                    that thou mightest make me what she ever desired.' It would be
                    a sorry world for all of us, if our unwise petitions did not often
                    have 'No' for their answer."—Harry Emerson Fosdick, The
                    Meaning of Prayer, pp. 119, 120.

                     Why should we be careful not to insist on having our own
                    way? Rom. 8:26, 27.

                       In our weakness we do not know what to ask for. We do not
                    know God's will in every circumstance, and therefore we must
                    trust God to take our prayers and interpret them for the good of
                    all. How fortunate we are that our God does not always grant our
                    requests but performs for us that which we cannot do for our-
                    selves. And He transforms our petitions into prayers that are in
                    harmony with His will.

THINK IT THROUGH      Why should we always trust God absolutely?

                          "Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take;
                            The clouds ye so much dread
                          Are big with mercy, and shall break
                            In blessings on your head.

                          "Judge not the Lord by feeble sense,
                            But trust Him for His grace;
                          Behind a frowning providence
                            He hides a smiling face."

Why Some Are Not Healed            LESSON 12                     ❑ Wednesday
                                                                 September 17
          Part 4     What is a basic request we should make of God?
         ACTING
     RATIONALLY       "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to
                   all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him"
                   (James 1:5).

                       Sometimes when we pray for health, what we really need is
                   wisdom so we will know how to preserve our health.
                       "He [God] is the Author of laws that when violated bring
                   trouble and pain. These bodies of ours are very obedient to the
                   laws of CAUSE AND EFFECT. . . .
                       "How can I distinguish between true and false healing? ...
                       "Does the healer tell those who come to be healed that their
                   illness may be the result of their own disregard of nature's laws?
                   Does he teach them how to cooperate with these laws in the
                   future?
                       "Does the healer tell his people about the healing power of
                   sunlight as it is allowed to shower its radiant energy over body
                   and soul?
                       "Does he tell them of the healing potential of ordinary
                   water—skillfully, scientifically, generously used, inside and
                   out?
                       "Does he tell men and women how to take a tip from their
                   heart and rest between the beats?
                       "Does he tell them about pure, fresh air, God's air-
                   conditioning system for body and mind? Air means oxygen, and
                   oxygen means life.
                       "Does the healer explain what happens to someone when he
                   neglects exercise? Does he explain that we must keep our
                   nerves in balance—that unless we balance mental activity with
                   physical exercise, sooner or later the mainspring will snap? A
                   brisk walk each day is cheaper and far more interesting than a
                   nervous breakdown.
                       "And does the healer say a word about diet—those fruits,
                   grains, nuts, and vegetables that the Creator chose for the
                   human race?"—George Vandeman, "What Faith Healers Don't
                   Tell You," Signs of the Times, December 1971.

THINK IT THROUGH     Is the use of intelligence a denial of faith?

                     "The human agent should have faith and should co-operate
                   with the divine power, using every facility, taking advantage of
                   everything that, according to his intelligence, is beneficial,
                   working in harmony with natural laws; and in doing this he
                   neither denies nor hinders faith."—Counsels on Health, p. 382.

          Part 5     What may be a benefit of passing through times of trouble?
       LEARNING
          FROM       "Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
      SUFFERING    the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort; who com-
                   forteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort
                   them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we
                   ourselves are comforted of God" (2 Cor. 1:3, 4).

                      How often we remark that affliction has "mellowed" some
                   friend or acquaintance! Abrasive, objectionable traits of charac-
                   ter have disappeared in the fires of sorrow and suffering.

                     "I asked the Lord that I might grow,
                        In faith, and love and ev'ry grace,
                     Might more of his salvation know,
                        And seek more earnestly his face.

                     "Twas he who taught me thus to pray,
                       And he I know has answered prayer,
                     But it has been in such a way
                       As almost drove me to despair."
                            —Olney Hymns
                            Quoted by Harry Emerson Fosdick,
                            The Meaning of Prayer, p. 112.

                      What benefits does James say we can gain from facing
                   trials? James 1:2, 4.
                     Facing trials successfully matures a person. It teaches us to
                   hate sin, and to help others overcome their trials.
                     If we were delivered miraculously from all sickness, how
                   could we sympathize with the sufferer? Only when we have felt
                   the scourge of pain can we understand what another person is
                   experiencing. The person who looks death in the face may
                   learn something about life that he could learn in no other way.

THINK IT THROUGH     How does helping others in their sorrow often help us?

                      "Often prayer is solicited for the afflicted, the sorrowful, the
                   discouraged; and this is right. We should pray that God will
                   shed light into the darkened mind and comfort the sorrowful
                   heart. But God answers prayer for those who place themselves
                   in the channel of His blessings. While we offer prayer for these
                   sorrowful ones, we should encourage them to try to help those
                   more needy than themselves. The darkness will be dispelled
                   from their own hearts as they try to help others. As we seek to
                   comfort others with the comfort wherewith we are comforted,
                   the blessing comes back to us."—The Ministry of Healing, p.

Why Some Are Not Healed            LESSON 12                         ❑ Friday
                                                                 September 19
           Part 6   Should we continue praying for those in sickness and dis-
     PERSISTING tress?
      IN PRAYER
                    "Let hope keep you joyful; in trouble stand firm; persist in
                  prayer" (Rom. 12:12, NEB).

                      Suppose a Christian becomes seriously ill. And suppose the
                   biblical instruction is followed—the elders of the church are
                   called in, the sick person is anointed, and earnest prayers are
                   offered for his recovery. But nothing happens. The illness con-
                   tinues and worsens. Should prayers cease? The leaders of the
                   church, his friends, his family should keep on praying. They
                   should pray that God will help him in his trouble, and that his
                   faith may not fail. As long as life lasts, the possibility remains
                   that God may see best to intervene in his behalf; and if death
                   comes, those who have prayed should not feel that their prayers
                   have been in vain.

                     What explanation did Jesus give when the disciples were
                   unable to cast a devil out? Matt. 17:19-21.

                     Prayer is more than a repetition of a formula. Prayer involves
                   the whole soul in a whole relationship with God, one of absolute
                   trust and confidence. Prayer does not insist on one solution to
                   the problem, the one we would like, but the one that would bring
                   honor and glory to God. True prayer is always consistent with
                   God's will.
                      Sometimes we neglect prayer because we become preoc-
                   cupied with other duties and activities. We need to reorder our
                   priorities.
                      Sometimes we neglect prayer because we lose our sense of
                   the presence of God. We have prayed and prayed and nothing
                   has seemed to happen. We need then to remember that God still
                   loves us, and also those for whom we pray.

THINK IT THROUGH     Why is it dangerous to neglect prayer? (See 1 Thess. 5:17.)

                     "The darkness of the evil one encloses those who neglect to
                   pray. The whispered temptations of the enemy entice them to
                   sin; and it is all because they do not make use of the privileges
                   that God has given them in the divine appointment of prayer.
                   Why should the sons and daughters of God be reluctant to pray,
                   when prayer is the key in the hand of faith to unlock heaven's
                   storehouse, where are treasured the boundless resources of
                   Omnipotence?"—Steps to Christ, pp. 94, 95.
                     Our afflicted friends never need our prayers more than during
                   long days, weeks, months, and perhaps years while disease and
                   pain are ravaging their lives.

            Part 1     What steps did God take to make us His sons?
        GOD'S SON
      BECAME MAN       "When the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his
                     Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them
                     that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of
                     sons" (Gal. 4:4, 5).

                       God made a sacrifice in sending His Son. The Son made a
                     sacrifice in becoming man and submitting to the indignities of
                     those who should have known better.
                        "This was a voluntary sacrifice. Jesus might have remained at
                     the Father's side. He might have retained the glory of heaven,
                     and the homage of the angels. But He chose to give back the scep-
                     ter into the Father's hands, and to step down from the throne of
                     the universe, that He might bring light to the benighted, and life
                     to the perishing."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 22, 23.
                        "In taking our nature, the Saviour has bound Himself to hu-
                     manity by a tie that is never to be broken. Through the eternal
                     ages He is linked with us. 'God so loved the world, that He gave
                     His only-begotten Son.' John 3:16. He gave Him not only to bear
                     our sins, and to die as our sacrifice; He gave Him to the fallen
                     race. To assure us of His immutable counsel of peace, God gave
                     His only-begotten Son to become one of the human family,
                     forever to retain His human nature."—The Desire of Ages, p. 25.

                       As Paul describes what Jesus was willing to do for us, what
                     does he say our attitude should be? Phil. 2:3-8.

                     who should read his epistle] could be brought to comprehend

The Sufferings of Jesus         LESSON 13                             ❑ Monday
                                                                    September 22
          Part 2       What change did Jesus experience in order to make recon-
      GOD'S SON     ciliation for sin?
          LIVED
        AS MAN        "He took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him
                    the seed of Abraham. Wherefore in all things it behoved him to
                    be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and
                    faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make recon-
                    ciliation for the sins of the people" (Heb. 2:16, 17).

                      It is significant that Jesus did not come to the earth at the
                    beginning of passion week and go back to heaven at its close.
                    He spent more than 30 years on earth so that He might taste life
                    as well as death.
                      "Mark the humble life of the Son of God. He was 'a man of
                    sorrows, and acquainted with grief.' Behold His ignominy, His
                    agony in Gethsemane, and learn what self-denial is. Are we
                    suffering want? so was Christ, the Majesty of heaven. But His
                    poverty was for our sakes. Are we ranked among the rich? so
                    was He. But He consented for our sakes to become poor, that we
                    through His poverty might be made rich. In Christ we have
                    self-denial exemplified. His sacrifice consisted not merely in
                    leaving the royal courts of heaven, in being tried by wicked men
                    as a criminal and pronounced guilty, and in being delivered up
                    to die as a malefactor, but in bearing the weight of the sins of the
                    world. The life of Christ rebukes our indifference and coldness."
                    —Testimonies, vol. 3, p. 407.

                      What characteristic of Jesus enables us to approach Him
                    with confidence? Heb. 4:15.

                       "As one of us He was to give an example of obedience. For
                    this He took upon Himself our nature, and passed through our
                    experiences. 'In all things it behooved Him to be made like unto
                    His brethren.' Heb. 2:17. If we had to bear anything which Jesus
                    did not endure, then upon this point Satan would represent the
                    power of God as insufficient for us. Therefore Jesus was 'in all
                    points tempted like as we are.' Heb. 4:15. He endured every trial
                    to which we are subject. And He exercised in His own behalf no
                    power that is not freely offered to us. As man, He met tempta-
                    tion, and overcame in the strength given Him from God."—The
                    Desire of Ages, p. 24.

 THINK IT THROUGH     If by His death and life Jesus has given me eternal life, what
                    should I do with my life?

                      "We cannot equal the pattern; but we shall not be approved of
                    God if we do not copy it and, according to the ability which God
                    has given, resemble it."—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 549.

The Sufferings of Jesus          LESSON 13                            ❑ Tuesday
                                                                    September 23
           Part 3     What was the disappointing experience of Jesus when He
      GOD'S SON     came to earth?
       SUFFERED
       AND DIED       "He came to his own home, and his own people received
         AS MAN     him not" (John 1:11, RSV).

                       The word "home" in the RSV has been supplied, but it has
                    been put there to bring out the difference that appears in the
                    Greek between the "his own" that He came to and the "his own"
                    who rejected Him. He came to the thing He had created, to that
                    over which He was Lord and by right had dominion. Yet the
                    people of His day whom He had created and chosen to be His
                    own were the ones who treated Him as a stranger and who
                    would not accept His works or testimony. Can you think of any
                    experience that would bring greater pain, disappointment, and
                    frustration? This rejection extended even to a disciple, Judas,
                    who betrayed Him.

                     What request did Jesus make as He knelt in the Garden of
                    Gethsemane? Matt. 26:39.

                      The fact that Jesus could offer this prayer is an indication that
                    He realized how hard it would be for Him to bear the cross. To
                    three of His disciples He said: "My soul is very sorrowful, even to
                    death" (verse 38, RSV).

                      What expression of mental anguish did Jesus utter on the
                    cross? Matt. 27:46.

                       "The withdrawal of the divine countenance from the Saviour
                    in this hour of supreme anguish pierced His heart with a sorrow
                    that can never be fully understood by man. So great was this
                    agony that His physical pain was hardly felt. . . .
                          . . . Christ felt the anguish which the sinner will feel when
                    mercy shall no longer plead for the guilty race. . .
                       " ... No eye could pierce the gloom that surrounded the cross,
                    and none could penetrate the deeper gloom that enshrouded
                    the suffering soul of Christ."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 753, 754.

                      With what words of resignation did Jesus breathe His last?
                    Luke 23:46.

THINK IT THROUGH      What is it that can make suffering in our lives bearable?

                      Jesus really suffered. Job was a great sufferer, but Jesus was
                    the great sufferer. We tend to forget how real and how intense
                    His sufferings were. And He suffered voluntarily. He chose to
                    suffer for you and me. It is this suffering that we memorialize as
                    we celebrate the Communion service.

          Part 4  "So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his gar-
      SYMBOL OF ments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye
     HUMILIATION what I have done to you?" (John 13:12).

                      What do you understand to be the meaning of Jesus' wash-
                    ing the disciples' feet?

                       There was no servant to perform the task of foot washing.
                    Each disciple waited for another to render this service.
                       "How was Christ to bring these poor souls where Satan would
                    not gain over them a decided victory? How could He show that a
                    mere profession of discipleship did not make them disciples, or
                    insure them a place in His kingdom? How could He show that it
                    is loving service, true humility, which constitutes real great-
                    ness? How was He to kindle love in their hearts, and enable
                    them to comprehend what He longed to tell them?
                       "The disciples made no move toward serving one another.
                    Jesus waited for a time to see what they would do. Then He, the
                    divine Teacher, rose from the table. Laying aside the outer
                    garment that would have impeded His movements, He took a
                    towel, and girded Himself. With surprised interest the disciples
                    looked on, and in silence waited to see what was to follow. 'After
                    that He poureth water into a basin, and began to wash the
                    disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith He
                    was girded.' This action opened the eyes of the disciples. Bitter
                    shame and humiliation filled their hearts. They understood the
                     unspoken rebuke, and saw themselves in altogether a new light.
                       "So Christ expressed His love for His disciples. Their selfish
                     spirit filled Him with sorrow, but He entered into no controversy
                     with them regarding their difficulty. Instead He gave them an
                     example they would never forget. His love for them was not
                     easily disturbed or quenched. He knew that the Father had
                     given all things into His hands, and that He came from God, and
                     went to God. He had a full consciousness of His divinity; but He
                     had laid aside His royal crown and kingly robes, and had taken
                     the form of a servant. One of the last acts of His life on earth was
                     to gird Himself as a servant, and perform a servant's part."—The

                      "This ordinance is Christ's appointed preparation for the
                    sacramental service. While pride, variance, and strife for
                    supremacy are cherished, the heart cannot enter into fellowship
                    with Christ. We are not prepared to receive the communion of
                    His body and His blood. Therefore it was that Jesus appointed
                    the memorial of His humiliation to be first observed."—The

      OF A BODY
                    "He took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave
                  unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this
                  do in remembrance of me" (Luke 22:19).

                      It is so easy to forget! The things of the world clamor for our
                   undivided attention. The great reality of Christ and His cross
                   recedes into the background. The Lord's Supper should bring
                   these truths back into focus, and should cause us to rededicate
                   ourselves to our Lord and Master.
                      "The administration of the Sacrament was to keep before the
                   disciples the infinite sacrifice made for each of them individu-

                   Ages, p. 660.
                      "As faith contemplates our Lord's great sacrifice, the soul
                   assimilates the spiritual life of Christ. . . .
                      "As we receive the bread and wine symbolizing Christ's bro-
                   ken body and spilled blood, we in imagination join in the scene
                   of Communion in the upper chamber. We seem to be passing
                   through the garden consecrated by the agony of Him who bore
                   the sins of the world. We witness the struggle by which our
                   reconciliation with God was obtained. Christ is set forth
                   crucified among us.
                      "Looking upon the crucified Redeemer, we more fully com-

                      "The life of Christ that gives life to the world is in His word. It
                   was by His word that Jesus healed disease and cast out demons;
                   by His word He stilled the sea, and raised the dead; and the
                   people bore witness that His word was with power. He spoke the
                   word of God, as He had spoken through all the prophets and
                   teachers of the Old Testament. The whole Bible is a manifesta-
                   tion of Christ, and the Saviour desired to fix the faith of His
                   followers on the word. When His visible presence should be
                   withdrawn, the word must be their source of power. Like their
                   Master, they were to live 'by every word that proceedeth out of

           Part 6   What meaning did Jesus give to the wine at the last Supper?
        SYMBOL How did the wine represent suffering?
       OF BLOOD
                    "Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the
                  new testament in my blood, which is shed for you" (Luke
                  22:20).

                       "That blood alone is efficacious. It alone can make propitia-
                    tion for our sins. It is the blood of the only-begotten Son of God
                    that is of value for us that we may draw nigh unto God, His blood
                    alone that taketh 'away the sin of the world.' "—Ellen G. White
                    Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 971.

                      What symbols did Jesus use to point out the only way to
                    eternal life? John 6:53-57. What did He mean? Verse 63.

                      "To eat the flesh and drink the blood of Christ is to receive
                    Him as a personal Saviour, believing that He forgives our sins,
                    and that we are complete in Him. It is by beholding His love, by
                    dwelling upon it, by drinking it in, that we are to become partak-
                    ers of His nature. What food is to the body, Christ must be to the
                    soul. Food cannot benefit us unless we eat it, unless it becomes
                    a part of our being. So Christ is of no value to us if we do not
                    know Him as a personal Saviour. A theoretical knowledge will
                    do us no good. We must feed upon Him, receive Him into the
                    heart, so that His life becomes our life. His love, His grace, must
                    be assimilated."—The Desire of Ages, p. 389.
                      "To the holy Communion this scripture [John 6:54-57] in a
                    special sense applies. As faith contemplates our Lord's great
                    sacrifice, the soul assimilates the spiritual life of Christ. That
                    soul will receive spiritual strength from every Communion. The
                    service forms a living connection by which the believer is bound

                           "Were the whole realm of nature mine,
                              That were a tribute far too small;
                           Love so amazing, so divine,
                              Demands my life, my soul, my all."

                    "Napoleon once said; 'Show me a family
                    readers, and I will show you the people wl

                    times I can recall as a young boy, and now
                    my own family, were spent together with
                    family members in reading. GUIDE has alw
                    been a part of our family. While some chi
                    journals are written primarily for adults, ai
                    some for children, GUIDE seems to bridge

someone introduces him to the Saviour.
