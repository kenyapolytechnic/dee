ADULT SABBATH SCHOOL LESSONS
      THIRTEENTH SABBATH OVERFLOW OFFERING
            Australasian Division—September 29, 1973
    The future of our work in the Central Pacific is centered on Fulton
College, Fiji, the senior educational institution in this part of the field.
Since 1949, when the union was first organized, the people of the 700
islands of the Central Pacific have looked to Fulton for their total worker
force as they have aggressively pursued the gospel outreach. The two
other union missions of the Australasian Division have also received
efficiently trained, consecrated workers from Fulton.
    Today Fulton College has representative, and nearly adequate, admin-
istrative and classroom facilities. This plant resulted in a large measure
from the generosity of Sabbath School members around the world, who
strongly supported the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering in March, 1963.
    Unfortunately, at the present time, when indigenous peoples of the
Central Pacific are lifting their general standard of living, Fulton's board-
ing facilities are very substandard, makeshift, and hopelessly inadequate.
Therefore, on September 29, 1973, we shall again confidently look to our
Sabbath School members to provide generously the necessary means
for the erection of much-needed dormitories at Fulton College. Thank
you again for your help.

   Relation. Ps. 24:1. (6) Man-God Relation. Luke 12:18-20.
      The title of the second lesson is "Man's Stewardship." The

                      JESUS AND HIS PEOPLE
                            General Introduction

   Many in the world today profess to follow Jesus. Do they know who Jesus is?
Do they recognize what it means to be a disciple of Jesus?
   It is the purpose of these lessons to study about Jesus as He relates to His
people here on earth. Hopefully in this way we can appreciate more fully what
He has done for us, and respond to Him in a more meaningful way.
   We see Jesus as Sovereign Lord, Creator of heaven and earth, worthy of wor-
ship and all praise. We see Him challenged by the covering cherub, a creature
who is described as being "full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty." See Ezek. 28:12-
14. How Satan came to do this, we cannot understand, but Isaiah tells us that pride
entered his heart. See Isa. 14:12-14. He thought he could set his throne above the
stars and be like the Most High.
   The subject of the controversy is God's character. Is God all-loving? Is He
absolutely fair? Can perfect love and perfect justice exist meaningfully side by side?
   Jesus took up the challenge. As Michael the Archangel, He fought with Satan
and the third of the angels who had been deceived. See Rev. 12:7, 8. As might
be expected, there was no room in heaven for deception and falsehood.
   The conflict was transferred to this earth. Satan succeeded in deceiving Eve
and in causing Adam to follow in the path of disobedience. But God was not
caught unawares. He had a plan for man's salvation, a plan that would reveal
God's true character.
   Down through the ages God has communicated with man in various ways.
Satan has had his counterfeit communications, but God's word has not been lost.
Finally, God sent His Son, born of a virgin, and the express image of the Father.
He went about doing good, and gave His life a ransom for many. Satan did his
best to prevent this final revelation of God's love, but he failed.
    Satan now tries to destroy God's people, and especially so as he recognizes
that his time is short. How are God's people to respond to this situation? It is
the purpose of these lessons to indicate some of the strategies of the enemy and
to show that, in spite of tremendous odds, God's people will triumph if they will
take up the challenge that is theirs and follow in the footsteps of the Master in
the strength which He alone can provide.
    It is the prayer of those who have compiled these lessons that Paul's petition
for the Ephesians (Eph. 1:17-23) may be fulfilled in the experience of every student.
          The Blessing of Daily Study
   "Every day some portion of time should be appropri-
ated to the study of the lessons, not merely in learning to
mechanically repeat the words, while the mind does not
comprehend the meaning; but to go to the very founda-
tion, and become familiar with what is brought out in the
lesson."—"Counsels on Sabbath School Work," page 53.




                       My Pledge
   As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge
of the Scriptures, I pledge myself to the careful and
prayerful study of some portion of my Sabbath School
lesson each day of the week.

        GOD WITH US
          Matt. 1:23      Jesus was no ordinary human baby. Luke, who understood
                       these matters, tells of the announcement to Mary and records
                       the words of the angel: "Therefore also that holy thing which
                       shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God." Luke
                       1:35. The virgin birth confirmed to Mary the divine origin of
                       Jesus. Joseph, who was engaged to Mary, was visited by an
                       angel who told him of the miracle. See Matt. 1:20-25. The Magi
                       who had seen the star in the East came to worship Jesus, ob-
                       viously recognizing His divinity. See Matt. 2:2. The shepherds,
                       Simeon, and Anna also recognized the significance of the
                       unique birth of Jesus and His special mission.
                          The ministry of Christ from start to finish is also clear evi-
                       dence that Jesus was the Son of God.

                          What was John the Baptist's witness about Jesus? Matt. 3:11.

                           When Jesus came out of the waters of baptism, a voice
                        from heaven said: "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well
                       pleased." Matt. 3:17. Jesus performed so many remarkable
                        miracles that Nicodemus was impelled to admit that Jesus was
                        no ordinary person. See John 3:1, 2. When Peter made the
                       confession, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God,"
                       Jesus answered: "Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh
                       and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which
                       is in heaven." Matt. 16:16, 17.
                           An outstanding occasion when Jesus claimed to be divine
                        was when He said to a paralytic: " 'Take heart, my son; your
                       sins are forgiven.' " Matt. 9:2, NEB. This was obviously blas-
                       phemous talk unless Jesus was divine and was in a position
                       to forgive sins. Immediately He performed a miracle of healing
                       to indicate that His claim was not without foundation.
                           After the resurrection doubting Thomas had his doubts
                       taken away, and he exclaimed: "My Lord and my God!" Then
                       "Jesus said to him 'Have you believed because you have seen
                       me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet believe.' "
                       John 20:28, 29, RSV.

    THINK IT THROUGH      Why is it important for me to believe that Jesus was divine?

                           "In His treatment of Thomas, Jesus gave a lesson for His
                       followers. His example shows how we should treat those whose
                       faith is weak, and who make their doubts prominent. Jesus did
                       not overwhelm Thomas with reproach, nor did He enter into
                       controversy with him.. . . Let Jesus, in His love and mercy, be
                       revealed as the crucified Saviour, and from many once un-

Jesus, Sovereign Lord LESSON 1                                        ❑   Monday
                                                                           July 2

          Part 2       To what extent was the Son of God the Creator?
                       "By him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that
  CREATOR OF ALL    are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or
        Col. 1:16   dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created
                    by him, and for him."

                        We human beings belong to this world. We are nourished
                    by products of the earth, and we breathe its atmosphere and
                    drink its water. But the One who became Jesus of Nazareth
                    was previous to and apart from creation. His pre-earth existence
                    did not depend on the elements of the created universe, for
                    He brought them into being. He is the originator of our lives
                    and of the food, air, and water that sustain us. Every world
                    and every living being, except the Godhead, were created by
                    the Son.
                        It is a staggering thought that the One who was born so
                     humbly in Bethlehem was the Lord of creation. In order to take
                    on human form He who was "in the form of God" and "equal
                    with God" "made himself of no reputation, and took upon him
                    the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men"
                    and "humbled himself." Phil. 2:6-8. Are we prepared to hum-
                    ble ourselves for the sake of others?
                        When we think of what Jesus had to do in order to save
                    man, we are struck with His great condescension, His great
                     love. But we should also remember that it is His power, coupled
                    with His love, that makes His salvation effective.
                       Why is Jesus able to "save them to the uttermost that come
                    unto God by him"? Heb. 7:24, 25.

                       Do we believe that Jesus is able? When Christians suffer
                    persecution and hardship and are tempted to give up their
                    principles of truth and righteousness, they can commit their
                    lives unreservedly to Him because, as Peter assures them,
                    "Their Maker will not fail them." 1 Peter 4:19, NEB.

                       "The Saviour condescended to poverty, that He might teach
                    how closely we in a humble lot may walk with God. He lived
                    to please, honor, and glorify His Father in the common things
                    of life. . . . He was doing God's service just as much when
                    laboring at the carpenter's bench as when working miracles
                    for the multitude."—The Desire of Ages, page 74.

            OF MEN
           Acts 4:12
                         Many who are not Christians recognize God as a Supreme
                     Being or as Creator. But worship becomes more personal and
                     meaningful when the Supreme Being and Creator is also the
                     Redeemer. Redemption forms a tie that makes the worshiper
                     forever grateful, willing to devote his whole life in service to
                     God because of what has been done for him. The good news
                     of the gospel is that the Creator of the universe is man's Re-
                     deemer.
                        What did God do in order to redeem man? John 3:16.


                        Job knew that he had a living Redeemer (Job 19:25), David
                     addressed God as his strength and Redeemer (Ps. 19:14), and
                     Isaiah referred to God as Father and Redeemer (Isa. 63.16).
                        "The plan for our redemption was not an afterthought, a
                     plan formulated after the fall of Adam. It was a revelation of
                     'the mystery which hath been kept in silence through times
                     eternal.' Rom. 16:25, R V         From the beginning, God and
                     Christ knew of the apostasy of Satan, and of the fall of man
                     through the deceptive power of the apostate. God did not
                     ordain that sin should exist, but He foresaw its existence, and
                     made provision to meet the terrible emergency. . . .
                        "Jesus might have remained at the Father's side. He might
                     have retained the glory of heaven, and the homage of the
                     angels. But He chose to give back the scepter into the Father's
                     hands, and to step down from the throne of the universe, that
                     He might bring light to the benighted, and life to the perish-
                     ing."—The Desire of Ages, pages 22, 23.
 THINK IT THROUGH       From what are we redeemed? Titus 2:14. What is the price
                     of our redemption? 1 Peter 1:18, 19; Rev. 5:9.


                         "Christ was treated as we deserve, that we might be treated
                     as He deserves. He was condemned for our sins, in which He
                     had no share, that we might be justified by His righteousness,
                     in which we had no share. He suffered the death which was
                     ours, that we might receive the life which was His."—The De-

                         "Through Christ's redeeming work the government of God
                     stands justified. The Omnipotent One is made known as the
                     God of love. Satan's charges are refuted, and his character
                     unveiled. Rebellion can never rise again. Sin can never again
                     enter the universe. Through eternal ages all are secure from

Jesus, Sovereign Lord LESSON 1                                    El Wednesday
                                                                         July 4

           Part 4    "For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom
                  are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the
      CAPTAIN OF captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings."
       SALVATION
        Heb. 2:10
                       The word translated "captain" in this verse is translated
                    "Prince" in Acts 3:15 and Acts 5:31. It means "leader," and is
                    so translated in the NEB in Heb. 2:10. Jesus is a leader who
                    leads His people to victory.
                       When Joshua was ready to enter the Promised Land and
                    take Jericho, he saw the "captain of the host of the Lord"
                    (Josh. 5:14). The context makes clear that this was no other
                    than Christ, for Joshua worshiped Him and was told to take
                    off his shoes because the ground he was standing on was
                    holy. "It was Christ, the Exalted One, who stood before the
                    leader of Israel."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 488.
                        Jesus is always with His people to lead them to victory. In
                    some times of crisis Jesus has revealed himself in power and
                    glory to give His people the confidence they needed. Dan.
                    10:5, 6; Rev. 1:13-17.
                        It is remarkable that in Heb. 2:10 the Captain of salvation
                    is said to be made perfect through sufferings. It is because
                     He suffered, and died, and rose again, that He is worthy of
                     being a leader.
                      In the song of the twenty-four elders why is Jesus declared
                    worthy to open the scroll of human history? Rev. 5:9, 10.


                       What do you think are the outstanding qualities of leader-
                    ship in the cause of God?
                       We need Jesus as our Leader because the fight in which
                    every Christian is engaged is not with flesh and blood; it is
                    a spiritual warfare. Eph. 6:12.
 THINK IT THROUGH      In what ways is Jesus my Captain when I face a crisis or
                    have an important decision to make?


                       "The Saviour's eye penetrates the future; He beholds the
                    broader fields in which, after His death, the disciples are to be
                    witnesses for Him. His prophetic glance takes in the experience
                    of His servants through all the ages till He shall come the
                    second time. He shows His followers the conflicts they must
                    meet. . . . They are to contend with supernatural forces, but
                    they are assured of supernatural help. All the intelligences of
                    heaven are in this army. And more than angels are in the
                    ranks. The Holy Spirit, the representative of the Captain of
                    the Lord's host, comes down to direct the battle. . . . The
                    power of Omnipotence is enlisted in behalf of those who trust
                    in God."—The Desire of Ages, page 352.

                                                                           July 5

            Part 5     How can the Heavenly Father be known by human beings?
 GOD'S REVELATION       "'Have I been all this time with you, Philip, and you still do
                     not know me? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father.
    John 14:9, NEB   Then how can you say, "Show us the Father"'?"

                        Many Christians have a false conception of the character of
                     God the Father. They think of Him as being harsh and exact-
                     ing, while they conceive of Jesus as being loving, gentle, and
                     compassionate. But Jesus pointed out very clearly the unity
                     that exists in the Godhead.
                        Paul recognized this truth, because he said that God was
                     in Christ, reconciling the world unto Himself. 2 Cor. 5:19. Do
                     we recognize what a father must feel when he sends his son
                     on a dangerous mission? Can we picture how God would feel
                     when His Son was on the cross?
                        It is the work of Satan to try to misrepresent God. This is
                     the work he has tried to do from the very beginning. Jesus
                      came to vindicate the character of God, to show His unfathom-
                     able love.
                        Unfortunately, love is often misunderstood. It is thought
                     of as being soft and yielding, and not subject to discipline. The
                     opposite is true. Love is consistent with discipline. Mercy and
                     justice are completely harmonized in God.
                         The cross is the perfect example of this. The law demanded
                     the death of the sinner. Justice required it. But God Himself,
                     from whom all created life came, died for man. This manifests
                     His great love. Thus on the cross we see the law maintained
                     and the sinner forgiven. "He, the Sin Bearer, endures the wrath
                     of divine justice, and for thy sake becomes sin itself."—The
                     Desire of Ages, page 756.
                        There were times when Jesus was angry. Can you see why?
                     Read Mark 3:5. Yet note that although angry, Jesus was also
                     grieved. Can we be angry in the same way? "Be ye angry, and
                     sin not," says Paul. Eph. 4:26. "The sufferings of every man
                     are the sufferings of God's child, and those who reach out no
                     helping hand to their perishing fellow beings provoke His
                     righteous anger. This is the wrath of the Lamb."—The Desire
                     of Ages, page 825.
 THINK IT THROUGH       Is my love for others only affection and sentiment? What
                     else is necessary in true love?

                         "God's love has been expressed in His justice no less than
                     in His mercy. Justice is the foundation of His throne, and the
                     fruit of His love. It had been Satan's purpose to divorce mercy
                     from truth and justice. ... But Christ shows that in God's plan
                     they are indissolubly joined together; the one cannot exist
                     without the other....
                         "By His life and death, Christ proved that God's justice did
                     not destroy His mercy, but that sin could be forgiven, and that
                     the law is righteous, and can be perfectly obeyed."—The De-

                                                                             July 6

            Part 6  "Jesus replied, 'I am the way; I am the truth and I am life;
  THE WAY OF LIFE no one comes to the Father except by me.' "
    John 14:6, NEB
                       Some people would say that Christians are arrogant when
                    they point to Jesus as the only way to life. There are many
                    who feel that God will accept anyone, so long as he is sincere.
                    But sincerity is not a safe guide to salvation. God is under-
                    standing. But the truths He has revealed are for men to accept;
                    and when a man rejects light that has been given to him, he
                    treads a dangerous path. Man cannot presume upon the good-
                    ness of God while pursuing his own selfish course. He must
                    search for truth; and having found it, he must cling to it and
                    share it with others.
                       How can a man be sure that he has the truth?
                       What is a result of knowing the truth? John 8:32.



                        In Romans 7 Paul describes the struggle that goes on in the
                    lives of many people. People want to do what is right, but find
                    themselves doing what is wrong. They are slaves of their sinful
                    nature. "The only condition upon which the freedom of man
                    is possible is that of becoming one with Christ."—The Desire
                    of Ages, page 466.
                        "Every soul that refuses to give himself to God is under the
                    control of another power. He is not his own. He may talk of
                    freedom, but he is in the most abject slavery. He is not allowed
                    to see the beauty of truth, for his mind is under the control of
                    Satan. While he flatters himself that he is following the dictates
                    of his own judgment, he obeys the will of the prince of dark-
                    ness."—The Desire of Ages, page 466.
 THINK IT THROUGH      What testimony can I give of what Christ has recently done
                    for me?



                       "In the work of redemption there is no compulsion. No exter-
                    nal force is employed. Under the influence of the Spirit of God,
                    man is left free to choose whom he will serve. In the change
                    that takes place when the soul surrenders to Christ, there is
                    the highest sense of freedom. The expulsion of sin is the act
                    of the soul itself. True, we have no power to free ourselves
                    from Satan's control; but when we desire to be set free from
                    sin, and in our great need cry out for a power out of and above
                    ourselves, the powers of the soul are imbued with the divine
                    energy of the Holy Spirit, and they obey the dictates of the
                    will in fulfilling the will of God."—The Desire of Ages, page 466.

            OF SIN ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of
     Isa. 14:12, 13 God."

                       A philosophy called dualism teaches that two eternal prin-
                    ciples dominate the universe, good and evil; that these two
                    principles have coexisted, and will continue to coexist through-
                    out eternity. The Christian who believes in the revelation given
                    in the Bible cannot accept such a philosophy. Difficult as it
                    may be to understand how sin could enter a perfect universe,
                    the fact is that it happened, and it began with a created being
                    called Lucifer.
                       How many times does the word "I" appear in Isa. 14:13, 14?


                       What does this tell you regarding the root of all sin? "Little
                    by little Lucifer came to indulge the desire for self-exaltation.
                       . Though all his glory was from God, this mighty angel came
                    to regard it as pertaining to himself. Not content with his posi-
                    tion, though honored above the heavenly host, he ventured to
                    covet homage due alone to the Creator."—Patriarchs and
                    Prophets, page 35.
                       Of whom was Lucifer particularly jealous? "Coveting the
                    glory with which the infinite Father had invested His Son, this
                    prince of angels aspired to power that was the prerogative of
                    Christ alone."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 35.
                        How did Jesus deal with the jealousy that arose in the heart
                    of Lucifer? "The Son of God presented before him the great-
                    ness, the goodness, and the justice of the Creator, and the
                    sacred, unchanging nature of His law. . . . But the warning,
                    given in infinite love and mercy, only aroused a spirit of re-
                    sistance. Lucifer allowed his jealousy of Christ to prevail, and
                    became the more determined."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page
                    36.
 THINK IT THROUGH      Why is sin such a subtle thing?


                       "Leaving his place in the immediate presence of the Father,
                    Lucifer went forth to diffuse the spirit of discontent among the
                    angels. He worked with mysterious secrecy, and for a time
                    concealed his real purpose under an appearance of reverence
                    for God. He began to insinuate doubts concerning the laws
                    that governed heavenly beings, intimating that though laws
                    might be necessary for the inhabitants of the worlds, angels
                    being more exalted, needed no such restraint, for their own
                    wisdom was a sufficient guide. . . . The exaltation of the Son
                    of God as equal with the Father was represented as an injus-

     WAR IN HEAVEN fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his
                     angels, and prevailed not; neither was their place found any
        Rev. 12:7, 8 more in heaven."

                         In the conflict that took place in heaven before the creation
                     of this world, one of the leaders was Michael. The name
                     "Michael" means, "who is like God." It is therefore a very
                     fitting name for Jesus, the Son of God. Jesus said to His
                     disciples: "Anyone who has seen me has seen the. Father."
                     John 14:9, NEB. Jesus is the express image of the Father
                     (Heb. 1:3), and would be the right person to lead the heavenly
                     hosts against the dragon, to champion truth against error.

                        What are other names for the dragon? Rev. 12:9.

                         The prime work of the devil is to deceive and destroy.
                     Therefore, Jesus said of him: "He was a murderer from the
                     beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no
                     truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own:
                     for he is a liar, and the father of it." John 8:44.
                         What do you think was the nature of the conflict that went
                     on in heaven? Was it spiritual, or physical, or both?
                         Note that the struggle involved a large number of persons,
                     because the devil had one third of the angels on his side.
                     Rev. 12:4.
                         Inasmuch as God's side was victorious, why was not Satan
                     immediately destroyed with all his cohorts? "The inhabitants
                     of heaven and of the worlds, being unprepared to comprehend
                     the nature or consequences of sin, could not then have seen
                     the justice of God in the destruction of Satan. Had he been
                     immediately blotted out of existence, some would have served
                     God from fear rather than from love. The influence of the de-
                     ceiver would not have been fully destroyed, nor would the
                     spirit of rebellion have been utterly eradicated. For the good
                     of the entire universe through ceaseless ages, he must more
                     fully develop his principles, that his charges against the divine
                     government might be seen in their true light by all created
                     beings, and that the justice and mercy of God and the immu-
                     tability of His law might be forever placed beyond all question."

                                                                         July 10

            Part 3   "And the angel said unto them, Fear not; for, behold, I bring
     JESUS COMES you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For
                   unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which
         TO SAVE is Christ the Lord."
     Luke 2:10, 11
                       Jesus came to this earth to save His people from their sins.
                    Ever since the fall of Adam and Eve man was caught in the
                    shackles of sin, and he needed a saviour. God had made a
                    plan to free him, a plan which He outlined in Gen. 3:15. An
                    essential part of this plan was that Jesus would come to earth
                    and die for man. Satan knew about this plan of redemption
                    because it was the theme of the Old Testament writings.

                      Where in the Old Testament do we read about the first ad-
                    vent of Jesus? Isa. 7:14; Micah 5:2; Dan. 9:25-27.


                       Satan strongly opposed the coming of Jesus. He knew that
                    the tidings of great joy to men would be his death knell, making
                    certain his destruction. John the Revelator pictures this situa-
                    tion in vivid terms: "And the dragon stood before the woman
                    which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as
                    soon as it was born." Rev. 12:4.

                      How did Satan seek to destroy Jesus? Matt. 2:16-18.
                      Why did Jesus come when He did, nearly two thousand years
                    ago? Gal. 4:4, 5.


                       "The world was ripe for the coming of the Deliverer. The
                    nations were united under one government. One language was
                    widely spoken, and was everywhere recognized as the !an-
                    guage of literature. From all lands the Jews of the dispersion
                    gathered to Jerusalem to the annual feasts. As these returned
                    to the places of their sojourn, they could spread throughout
                    the world the tidings of the Messiah's coming."—The Desire

                       "In the annals of human history the growth of nations, the
                    rise and fall of empires, appear as dependent on the will and

                    the play and counterplay of human interests and power and

             Part 4      "Then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to
       JESUS MEETS be tempted of the devil."
       THE TEMPTER      The devil had failed to destroy Jesus at the time of His
           Matt. 4:1 birth. He failed to cause Jesus to sin when, as a youth, He grew
                     up in Nazareth and was subject to His parents. Therefore
                     after Jesus had fasted forty days in the wilderness, Satan ap-
                     proached Him, hoping now to cause Him to fall in a moment
                     of weakness. This has always been the strategy of Satan with
                     man, and only too often he has succeeded.
                        "It was in the time of greatest weakness that Christ was
                     assailed by the fiercest temptations. Thus Satan thought to
                     prevail. By this policy he had gained the victory over men."
                     —The Desire of Ages, page 120.
                       What were the temptations that Satan presented to Jesus?
                     Matt. 4:3, 5-7, 8, 9.

                         "With Christ, as with the holy pair in Eden, appetite was the
                      ground of the first great temptation. Just where the ruin began,
                     the work of our redemption must begin."—The Desire of Ages,
                     page 117.
                         The second temptation was an invitation to presumption
                     based on a doubt. "If thou be . . . cast thyself down." Jesus
                     refrained "from the slightest acceptance of doubt." "Faith is
                     in no sense allied to presumption. Only he who has true faith
                     is secure against presumption. . . . Faith claims God's prom-
                     ises, and brings forth fruit in obedience. Presumption also
                     claims the promises, but uses them as Satan did, to excuse
                     transgression."—The Desire of Ages, page 126.
                        The third temptation was the offer of the world in a way that
                     would by-pass suffering. But "Christ's mission could be fulfilled
                     only through suffering. . . . He must bear the sins of the whole
                     world....
                        "By the one who had revolted in heaven the kingdoms of
                     this world were offered Christ, to buy His homage to the prin-
                     ciples of evil; but He would not be bought; He had come to
                     establish a kingdom of righteousness, and He would not aban-
                     don His purpose."—The Desire of Ages, pages 129, 130.
 THINK IT THROUGH       What are some of the great temptations that come to
                     the Christian today?

                         "Often the follower of Christ is brought where he cannot
                     serve God and carry forward his worldly enterprises. Perhaps
                     it appears that obedience to some plain requirement of God
                     will cut off his means of support. Satan would make him be-
                     lieve that he must sacrifice his conscientious convictions. But
                     the only thing in our world upon which we can rely is the word

                          Jesus gained a signal victory over Satan in the wilderness,
                       but the archenemy was not to leave Him alone. Throughout
                       His ministry of three and a half years, Jesus was in constant
                       conflict with evil forces. Satan sought to destroy Him in the

                       His hour had not yet come, and nothing could prevent God's
                       purposes from being fulfilled.
                          The supreme effort of Satan to destroy Jesus came at the
                       end of His ministry. The events leading up to Calvary were
                       fraught with struggle and controversy. Alone, deprived of the
                       comfort and companionship of the disciples, Jesus had to make
                       the decision to drink the bitter cup. The whole universe was
                       witness to the scene in Gethsemane. "The worlds unfallen and
                       the heavenly angels had watched with intense interest as the
                       conflict drew to its close. Satan and his confederacy of evil, the
                       legions of apostasy, watched intently this great crisis in the
                       work of redemption. The powers of good and evil waited to
                       see what answer would come to Christ's thrice-repeated prayer.
                       Angels had longed to bring relief to the divine sufferer, but this
                       might not be. No way of escape was found for the Son of
                       God."—The Desire of Ages, page 693.
                          When Jesus had made His decision, the events leading to
                       the cross followed in quick succession: the betrayal kiss, the
                       mock trials, the cry of the people, "Crucify Him!" and then
                       Calvary. Satan was the prime mover in every trial and temp-
                       tation. But Christ did not yield in a single thought or word,
                       even though the temptations He met were so fierce that they
                        wrung His heart. Jesus sounded the note of victory when He
                       said: "It is finished."
 THINK IT THROUGH         For what purposes did Jesus gain the victory over Satan?

                       the heavenly universe. He had revealed himself as a murderer.
                       By shedding the blood of the Son of God, he had uprooted
                       himself from the sympathies of the heavenly beings. Henceforth

  Gen. 2:16, 11, NEB
                          It is clear from Scripture that after God created man He
                       communicated with him. He laid down the principles of God's

                          The words of the serpent were a direct challenge to the

                       has been an attempt to change the law itself, so as to lead
                       men to violate its precepts while professing to obey it"—
                       Prophets and Kings, page 178.

 THINK IT THROUGH         How has the entrance of sin affected man's communion
                       with his Maker? How do we know of God's will for us?

                          "The holy pair were not only children under the fatherly
                       care of God but students receiving instruction from the all-wise
                       Creator. They were visited by angels, and were granted com-
                       munion with their Maker, with no obscuring veil between. They
                       were full of vigor imparted by the tree of life, and their intel-
                       lectual power was but little less than that of the angels. The
                       mysteries of the visible universe . .. afforded them an exhaust-
                       less source of instruction and delight. The laws and operations
                       of nature, which have engaged men's study for six thousand
                       years, were opened to their minds by the infinite Framer and
                       Upholder of all."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pages 50, 51.

                                                                           July 16

           Part 2     "Believe in the Lord your God, so shall ye be established;
                   believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper."
     THROUGH THE
        PROPHETS      After sin entered the world God used a number of means
    2 Chron. 20:20 to communicate with His people. (1) Angels. Gen. 19:15.
                     (2) Dreams. Gen. 37. (3) Urim and Thummim. Ex. 28:30; Num.
                     27:21; Patriarchs and Prophets, page 351. (4) Special circum-
                     stances. Ex. 34:6. (5) Created works. Ps. 19:1, 2. (6) The Holy
                     Spirit. Isa. 30:21. But it was through the prophets that God
                     made His major communications.
                        How does God communicate with His people today? Some
                     of the prophets were oral prophets, like Elijah and Elisha, but
                     others were told to write out their messages for future gen-
                     erations. Jer. 36:2.
                       What phrases did the prophets use to indicate that the mes-
                     sages they bore were not their own? Isa. 1:1; 8:1; Jer. 1:4.

                        What is one way that God's communication through prophets
                     is challenged by Satan? Matt. 24:11, 24; 7:15.

                         "In these days of delusion, every one who is established in
                     the truth will have to contend for the faith once delivered to
                     the saints. Every variety of error will be brought out in the
                     mysterious working of Satan, which would, if it were possible,
                     deceive the very elect, and turn them from the truth.. .
                         "There will be false dreams and false visions, which have
                     some truth, but lead away from the original faith."—Ellen G.
                     White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 7, p. 952.
                         Not only were there prophets, but there were schools of
                     the prophets. "The schools of the prophets were founded by
                     Samuel to serve as a barrier against the widespread corrup-
                     tion, to provide for the moral and spiritual welfare of the youth,
                     and to promote the future prosperity of the nation by furnishing
                     it with men qualified to act in the fear of God as leaders and
                     counselors."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 593.
                         Unfortunately the children of Israel did not always pay heed
                     to the counsels that came to them through the prophets, and
                     so they were taken into captivity and allowed to suffer terribly.
  THINK IT THROUGH      How do you think the life of the church today would be
                     different if the members of the church followed the instructions
                     of the prophets? What can we learn from the schools of the
                     prophets that might apply to our educational system?

                        "Of special value to God's church on earth today—the
                     keepers of His vineyard—are the messages of counsel and
                     admonition given through the prophets who have made plain
                     His eternal purpose in behalf of mankind. In the teachings of
                     the prophets, His love for the lost race and His plan for their
                     salvation are clearly revealed."—Prophets and Kings, page. 22.

             Part 3      "God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in
                      time past unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these
          THE WORD last   days spoken unto us by his Son."
         INCARNATE
          Heb. 1:1, 2
                         Experience has shown that language can often be misun-
                      derstood. But a life that is lived is an unmistakable testimony
                      of love and concern. God's revelation to man found its apex
                      of fulfillment in the person and life of Jesus Christ.
                         If you wanted to show your love for someone, what would
                     you do? Why do actions speak louder than words? "The King
                     of glory stooped low to take humanity. Rude and forbidding
                      were His earthly surroundings. His glory was veiled, that the
                     majesty of His outward form might not become an object of
                      attraction. He shunned all outward display. Riches, worldly
                     honor, and human greatness can never save a soul from death;
                     Jesus purposed that no attraction of an earthly nature should
                      call men to His side. Only the beauty of heavenly truth must
                     draw those who would follow Him. The character of the Mes-
                     siah had long been foretold in prophecy, and He desired men
                     to accept Him upon the testimony of the word of God."—The
                     Desire of Ages, page 43.
                         In last week's lesson we studied Satan's continuing chal-
                     lenge to Jesus in His earthly life. By threat of death and by
                     temptation Satan sought to prevent the revelation of God in
                     the life of Jesus Christ. But by the same grace that is available
                     to us Jesus met Satan's challenges, and His life is summed up
                     in the words: "Who went about doing good, and healing all
                     that were oppressed by the devil; for God was with him." Acts
                     10:38. How would you sum up the message of Jesus' life? Are
                     there aspects of the life of Jesus besides these that you would
                     like to emphasize?
                         The writer to the Hebrews said: "Consider him who endured
                     from sinners such hostility against himself, so that you may
                     not grow weary or faint-hearted. In your struggle against sin
                     you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood."
                     Heb. 12:3, 4, RSV.
 THINK IT THROUGH      Why is it that more Christians are not reflecting the life of
                     Jesus? Why should we contemplate more on the life of Jesus?

                        "In the commission to His disciples, Christ not only outlined
                     their work, but gave them their message. Teach the people, He
                     said, 'to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded
                     you.' The disciples were to teach what Christ had taught. That
                     which He had spoken, not only in person, but through all the
                     prophets and teachers of the Old Testament, is here included.
                     Human teaching is shut out. There is no place for tradition, for
                     man's theories and conclusions, or for church legislation. . . .
                     Christ's name is their watchword, their badge of distinction,
                     their bond of union, the authority for their course of action, and
                     the source of their success."—The Desire of Ages, page 826.

Jesus' Word and Satan's Challenge         LESSON 3                  ❑ Wednesday
                                                                         July 18

             Part 4    "All scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teach-
                    ing, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteous-
      THE WRITTEN ness,    that the man of God may be complete, equipped for
              WORD every good work."
2 Tim. 3:16,17, RSV
                        Those whose writings have been preserved in the Bible were
                    especially equipped for their task. Peter says of them: "For it
                    was not through any human whim that men prophesied of old;
                    men they were, but, impelled by the Holy Spirit, they spoke the
                    words of God." 2 Peter 1:21, NEB.
                        Some of the writers did special research in order to ensure
                    the truth of everything that was written. All this makes the
                    Bible a special book. "For the word of God is alive and active.
                    It cuts more keenly than any two-edged sword, piercing as
                    far as the place where life and spirit, joints and marrow, divide.
                    It sifts the purposes and thoughts of the heart." Heb. 4:12, NEB.
                        "The whole Bible is a manifestation of Christ, and the Sav-
                    iour desired to fix the faith of His followers on the word. When
                    His visible presence should be withdrawn, the word must be
                    their source of power."—The Desire of Ages, page 390.
                        "The Holy Scriptures are the perfect standard of truth, and
                    as such should be given the highest place in education."—
                    Education, page 17.
                       Identify one challenge of the Written Word of God. Dan. 7:25.

                       "Those who are unwilling to accept the plain, cutting truths
                    of the Bible are continually seeking for pleasing fables that
                    will quiet the conscience. . . . Satan is ready to supply the
                    heart's desire, and he palms off his deceptions in the place
                    of truth. It was thus that the papacy gained its power over
                    the minds of men; and by rejection of the truth because it in-
                    volves a cross, Protestants are following the same path. All
                    who neglect the word of God to study convenience and policy,
                    that they may not be at variance with the world, will be left
                    to receive damnable heresy for religious truth. Every con-
                    ceivable form of error will be accepted by those who willfully
                    reject the truth."—The Great Controversy, page 523.
                      What are two of the benefits of the study of the Word of
                    God? Ps. 119:11, 105.
 THINK IT THROUGH      How far can the success of the Christian be attributed to
                    his reading of the Bible?
                       "With the word of God in his hands, every human being,
                    wherever his lot in life may be cast, may have such companion-
                    ship as he shall choose. In its pages he may hold converse
                    with the noblest and best of the human race, and may listen
                    to the voice of the Eternal as He speaks with men.... He who
                    through the word of God has lived in fellowship with heaven,
                    will find himself at home in heaven's companionship."—Edu-

                                                                              July 19

                Part 5     Who is the beast from the bottomless pit? Rev. 20:1-3.
           AN ATTACK
       ON THE WORD          "And when they have finished their testimony, the beast
     Rev. 11:1, 8, RSV   that ascends from the bottomless pit will make war upon them
                         and conquer them and kill them, and their dead bodies will lie
                         in the street of the great city which is allegorically called
                         Sodom and Egypt, where their Lord was crucified."
                            Since the Bible is God's Good News to man, it was to be
                         expected that Satan would direct his attacks against it. John
                         the Revelator saw in vision two witnesses who prophesy for
                         one thousand two hundred sixty days in mourning, but were
                         eventually overcome and killed. Rev. 11:3-7. "The two witnesses
                         represent the Scriptures of the Old and the New Testament.
                         Both are important testimonies to the origin and perpetuity of
                         the law of God. Both are witnesses also to the plan of salva-
                         tion. The types, sacrifices, and prophecies of the Old Testament
                         point forward to a Saviour to come. The Gospels and Epistles
                         of the New Testament tell of a Saviour who has come in the
                         exact manner foretold by type and prophecy."—The Great Con-
                         troversy, page 267. This prophecy saw its fulfillment in the
                         event connected with the French Revolution. The Bible was
                         banned and Reason was worshipped. Not long after this the
                         Bible was publicly burned.
                             But the prophecy indicated a complete reversal of the situa-
                         tion. "After three days and an half the spirit of life from God
                         entered into them, and they stood upon their. feet.... And they
                         ascended up to heaven in a cloud." Rev. 11:11, 12. Not long
                         after the French Revolution the British and Foreign Bible So-
                         ciety was founded in 1804. Twelve years later the American
                         Bible Society was founded. As a result of the work of these
                         Bible societies the Bible has been translated in whole or in part
                         in over a thousand languages. The Bible is the world's best
                         seller, and new translations are coming out frequently. Thus
                         Satan's attempt to suppress the Word of God has resulted in
                         utter failure.
 THINK IT THROUGH            Satan has not succeeded in destroying the Word of God,
                         but has he succeeded in destroying confidence in it? Why is
                         it so few people read their Bibles?
                            "Satan employs every possible device to prevent men from
                         obtaining a knowledge of the Bible; for its plain utterances
                         reveal his deceptions. At every revival of God's work the prince
                         of evil is aroused to more intense activity; he is now putting
                         forth his utmost efforts for a final struggle against Christ and
                         His followers. The last great delusion is soon to open before

Jesus' Word and Satan's Challenge LESSON 3                                 ❑ Friday
                                                                             July 20

            Part 6      "Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the proph-
                     ets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto
      THE WORD       you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in
    TRIUMPHANT       no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled."
    Matt. 5:17, 18


                         God's Word is powerful and effective. It is weighted with
                     eternal consequences. God never changes, and His Word par-
                     takes of His character. It is not surprising, therefore, that God's
                     Word should triumph over the challenges of Satan.
                         Why do some people suggest that the Bible is not relevant
                     to our times? "The multitudes do not want Bible truth, because
                     it interferes with the desires of the sinful, world-loving heart;
                     and Satan supplies the deceptions which they love."—The
                     Great Controversy, page 595.
                        How did the psalmist regard God's communication? Ps.
                     119:103.



                         "It is the first and highest duty of every rational being to
                     learn from the Scriptures what is truth, and then to walk in the
                     light and encourage others to follow his example. We should
                     day by day study the Bible diligently, weighing every thought
                     and comparing scripture with scripture. With divine help we
                     are to form our opinions for ourselves as we are to answer for
                     ourselves before God."—The Great Controversy, page 598.
                         What are the dangers of depending on others for a knowl-
                     edge of Bible truth? "Satan is constantly endeavoring to attract
                     attention to man in the place of God. He leads the people to
                      look to bishops, to pastors, to professors of theology, as their
                     guides, instead of searching the Scriptures to learn their duty
                     for themselves. Then, by controlling the minds of these leaders,
                     he can influence the multitudes according to his will."—The
                     Great Controversy, page 595.
 THINK IT THROUGH       What is a good plan for the study of the Bible?




                        "The Bible should never be studied without prayer. The
                     Holy Spirit alone can cause us to feel the importance of those
                     things easy to be understood, or prevent us from wresting truths
                     difficult of comprehension. It is the office of heavenly angels
                     to prepare the heart so to comprehend God's word that we
                     shall be charmed with its beauty, admonished by its warnings,
                     or animated and strengthened by its promises."—The Great

                        One of the first things Jesus did after He entered His min-

                    to enjoy the benefits of salvation are also called to share their
                    blessings with others.
                      What blessings did Jesus seek to distribute through His
                    chosen men? Matt. 10:8.


                       "The children of God are called to be representatives of
                    Christ, showing forth the goodness and mercy of the Lord. As
                    Jesus has revealed to us the true character of the Father, so
                    we are to reveal Christ to a world that does not know His

                        How far should the Christian leave the world and yet remain

                    order to reveal Himself through them to all the inhabitants of
                    the earth. It was for the accomplishment of this very purpose
                     that He commanded them to keep themselves distinct from the

                    and not be pharisaical at the same time?


                       "The Israelites did not realize that to be in this respect
                    unlike other nations was a special privilege and blessing. God

     THE FELLOWSHIP of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord."
           1 Cor. 1:9
                        The Christian is called out of the world, and separates him-
                     self from the evil that is in it. But this is no sacrifice for him;
                     he is actually leaving that which cannot satisfy, that which
                     downgrades and destroys. Read 1 John 2:15-17.
                        More positively, he is invited to join a new fellowship, a new
                     relationship that will bring joy and blessing and life. It is a
                     vertical fellowship with Jesus Christ, and a horizontal fellow-
                     ship with Christian friends and neighbors.

                       What is the implied meaning of fellowship in 2 Cor. 6:14?
                     What is the relationship between fellowship and love?


                        The fellowship with Jesus means companionship and under-
                     standing. He knows our needs and supplies them.

                        What is one of the needs which Jesus supplies? Matt.
                     11:28-30.


                        "In these words Christ is speaking to every human being.
                     Whether they know it or not, all are weary and heavy-laden. All
                     are weighed down with burdens that only Christ can remove.
                     The heaviest burden that we bear is the burden of sin. If
                     we were left to bear this burden, it would crush us. But the
                     Sinless One has taken our place.... He has borne the burden
                     of our guilt. He will take the load from our weary shoulders.
                     He will give us rest. The burden of care and sorrow also He
                     will bear. He invites us to cast all our care upon Him; for He
                     carries us upon His heart."—The Desire of Ages, pages 328,

            Part 3     "And he is the head of the body, the church."
 THE ORGANIZATION
         Col. 1:18      The Christian enjoys more than a beautiful fellowship with
                     Christ and his fellow Christians when he enters the church. He
                     becomes a vital member of a closely knit organization of which
                     Christ is the head. He is now to live and act in accordance with
                     the commands of his Master. He is not his own.
                       When a person is attached to Christ, does he lose his free-
                     dom or does he gain it? John 8:32-36.

                         "Every man is free to choose what power he will have to
                     rule over him. None have fallen so low, none are so vile, but
                     that they can find deliverance in Christ. The demoniac, in place
                     of prayer, could utter only the words of Satan; yet the heart's
                     unspoken appeal was heard. No cry from a soul in need, though
                     it fail of utterance in words, will be unheeded. Those who will
                     consent to enter into covenant relation with the God of heaven
                     are not left to the power of Satan or to the infirmity of their
                     own nature."—The Desire of Ages, pages 258, 259.
                        What are the talents placed in the church, and why are they
                     there? Eph. 4:11-13.

                        The Christian develops his talent by using what he has. The
                     parable of the talents shows us that it does not matter how
                     many talents we have; the faithful man with the two talents
                     was praised as highly as the one with five. The one who had
                     one talent failed because he did not use the one he had. Matt.
                     25:15-30.
                        "Of every Christian the Lord requires growth in efficiency
                     and capability in every line. Christ has paid us our wages, even
                     His own blood and suffering, to secure our willing service. He
                     came to our world to give us an example of how we should
                     work, and what spirit we should bring into our labor."—Christ's
                     Object Lessons, pages 330, 331.
 THINK IT THROUGH        Am I doing what God would have me to do with my talents
                     in the church?

                        "The Lord has a great work to be done, and He will bequeath
                     the most in the future life to those who do the most faithful,
                     willing service in the present life. The Lord chooses his own
                     agents, and each day under different circumstances He gives
                     them a trial in His plan of operation. In each true-hearted en-
                     deavor to work out His plan, He chooses His agents not be-

      THE FUNCTION cannot be hid."
          Matt. 5:14
                        Jesus described the function of the believer as being to let
                     his light shine. Jesus is the Light of the world, the one who
                     gives light to everyone who comes into the world, and the
                     member is to be a light also in his circle of influence.

                     God rather than the Christian. At least, that is the way it ought
                     to be! That is because the Christian knows that of himself he
                     can do nothing good. It was the goodness of God that led him
                     to repentance. By grace is he saved. He can do all things, but
                     only through Christ who strengthens him. Thus when people
                     praise him, he points to God as the one who has done all things
                     well. Unfortunately it is very human to appropriate to oneself
                     praise that belongs to another. "If the children of God, espe-
                     cially those who stand in positions of responsibility, can be
                     led to take to themselves the glory that is due to God, Satan
                     exults. He has gained a victory."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
                     page 421.

                        What men spoken of in the Bible were distinguished by let-
                     ting their light shine? Gen. 5:24; 18:19; Dan. 1:8.


                         "His [Abraham's] religion was not held as a precious trea-
                     sure to be jealously guarded and enjoyed solely by the posses-
                     sor. True religion cannot be thus held, for such a spirit is con-
                     trary to the principles of the gospel. While Christ is dwelling
                     in the heart it is impossible to conceal the light of His pres-
                     ence, or for that light to grow dim."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
                     page 134.
 THINK IT THROUGH       What does it mean to let one's light shine?


                        "The Jews thought to confine the benefits of salvation to
                     their own nation; but Christ showed them that salvation is like
                     the sunshine. It belongs to the whole world. The religion of
                     the Bible is not to be confined between the covers of a book,
                     nor within the walls of a church. It is not to be brought out
                     occasionally for our own benefit, and then to be carefully laid
                     aside again. It is to sanctify the daily life, to manifest itself in
                     every business transaction and in all our social relations."—

           Part 5      "And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach
                    the gospel to every creature."
  THE COMMISSION
       Mark 16:15      The disciple of Jesus will find many opportunities for service
                    in his own neighborhood, but he must set his eyes on the four
                    corners of the earth and be sure that the gospel is being
                    preached in the out-of-the-way places as well as those nearby.
                    He may be called to serve overseas, or he may not; but with
                    his offerings he can help support those who have been called
                    and are doing the work that needs to be done.
                       Why is missionary work such an important feature of church
                    activity? Matt. 28:18-20.

                        "It is in doing Christ's work that the church has the promise
                    of His presence. . . . To take His yoke is one of the first con-
                    ditions of receiving His power. The very life of the church de-
                    pends upon her faithfulness in fulfilling the Lord's commission.
                    To neglect this work is surely to invite spiritual feebleness and
                    decay. Where there is no active labor for others, love wanes,
                    and faith grows dim."—The Desire of Ages, page 825.
                       What is another name for a missionary? 2 Cor. 5:20.

                       "Since His ascension Christ has carried forward His work
                    on the earth by chosen ambassadors, through whom He speaks
                    to the children of men and ministers to their needs. The great
                    Head of the church superintends His work through the instru-
                    mentality of men ordained by God to act as His representa-
                    tives."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 360.
                        The work of preaching the gospel has been given to the
                    church, not only to help the people to whom the gospel is
                    being preached, but to help the missionaries themselves. The
                    story of Jonah is well worth study in this connection. Jonah
                    was one who had the requisite talent to bring the city of Nine-
                    veh to repentance. But Jonah needed the experience of going
                    to Nineveh in order to learn some important lessons himself.
 THINK IT THROUGH       Does the church preach the gospel in all the world because
                    men are in need of light, or because Jesus has commissioned
                    it to do this? Is the sending church in any way superior to the
                    receiving church?

                       "The church is God's appointed agency for the salvation
                    of men. It was organized for service, and its mission is to carry
                    the gospel to the world. From the beginning it has been God's
                    plan that through His church shall be reflected to the world
                    His fullness and His sufficiency. The members of the church,
                    those whom He has called out of darkness into His marvelous
                    light, are to show forth His glory. The church is the repository
                    of the riches of the grace of Christ; and through the church
                    will eventually be made manifest . . . the final and full display
                    of the love of God."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 9.

             Part 6    What was the meaning of John's vision of Jesus in Rev.
    THE PRESENCE 1:13-15? See also verse 20.
  AND THE POWER        "Among them stood a being who looked like a man, wearing
 Rev. 1:13.15, TEV; a robe that reached to his feet, and a gold band around his
                    chest. His hair was white as wool, or as snow, and his eyes
      Acts 1:8, TEV blazed like fire; his feet shone like brass melted in the furnace
                     and then polished, and his voice sounded like a mighty water-
                     fall."
                         "You will be filled with power when the Holy Spirit comes
                     on you, and you will be witnesses for me in Jerusalem, in all
                     of Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth."
                         The church can set out with utmost confidence to fulfill
                     its gospel commission because it has been promised the pres-
                     ence of Jesus and the power of the Holy Spirit.
                        What must happen before the end can come? Matt. 24:14.
                         God has no other plan to finish His work than through con-
                     secrated men and women. "God could have proclaimed His
                     truth through sinless angels, but this is not His plan. . . . The
                     priceless treasure is placed in earthen vessels."—The Acts of
                     the Apostles, page 330.
                         There is given to man the privilege of being a co-worker with
                     God. "Enfeebled and defective as it may appear, the church is
                     the one object upon which God bestows in a special sense His
                     supreme regard. It is the theater of His grace, in which He
                     delights to reveal His power to transform hearts."—The Acts
                     of the Apostles, page 12.
                         What assurance do we have that the work of God will be
                     finished? Rom. 9:28.
                        Regardless of the problems that men may see, such as popu-
                     lation explosions, lack of funds, and closing doors, the work
                     is God's and He will see that it is accomplished. The urgent
                     question is a personal one: Am I doing what I can to hasten
                     the second coming of Jesus?
 THINK IT THROUGH       Is there something more the laymen ought to be doing, than
                     is now being done, in order to finish God's work on the earth?
                        "The promise of the Holy Spirit is not limited to any age or
                     to any race. Christ declared that the divine influence of His
                     Spirit was to be with His followers unto the end. From the Day
                     of Pentecost to the present time, the Comforter has been sent
                     to all who have yielded themselves fully to the Lord and to His
                     service. To all who have accepted Christ as a personal Sav-
                     iour, the Holy Spirit has come as a counselor, sanctifier, guide,
                     and witness. The more closely believers have walked with God,
                     the more clearly and powerfully have they testified of their
                     Redeemer's love and of His saving grace."—The Acts of the

                        Belief of the truth is a vital part of one's relationship with
                     God. It is not sufficient to be sincere in one's convictions. This
                     is not to deny the value of sincerity, but sincerity and truth
                     must go together. 1 Cor. 5:8.
                        Where is the source of all truth? John 14:6; 2 Tim. 3:16.
                        John points out the importance of abiding in the doctrine of
                     Christ; it is the difference between walking with God and not
                     walking with Him.
                         "The preaching and teaching of His word is one of the means
                     that God has ordained for diffusing light; but we must bring
                     every man's teaching to the test of Scripture. Whoever will
                     prayerfully study the Bible, desiring to know the truth, that he
                     may obey it, will receive divine enlightenment."—The Desire

                        What are some of the teachings that believers of the first

                     16:12.

                         The devil is still active, and he continues to spread lies
                     about God and about the universe. He tempts men to leave the
                     truth for the sake of temporal gain. Thus it was with Balaam.
                     Judas fell into the same trap. "The fate of Balaam was similar
                     to that of Judas, and their characters bear a marked resem-
                     blance to each other. Both these men tried to unite the service
                     of God and mammon, and met with signal failure."—Patriarchs

                     rect belief? John 7:17.

                        When a Christian is sincere in wanting to know the truth and
                     is willing to walk in its light, truth will be revealed to him. It is
                     for this purpose that the Holy Spirit has been promised.
 THINK IT THROUGH       Why is it that so many people believe error rather than the
                     truth? Can we blame others, or should we blame ourselves
                     when we are deceived?

                        "Rome withheld the Bible from the people and required all
                     men to accept her teachings in its place. It was the work of

                     not too true that in the churches of our time men are taught
                     to rest their faith upon their creed and the teachings of their

           Part 2   "I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life
         LEADERS for the sheep."
       John 10:11
                       Jesus set the pattern of true leadership. Not only were His
                    teachings sound, but His example was faultless. He came to
                    serve, rather than to be served, even to the ultimate sacrifice
                    of giving His life for His people.

                       What distinction did Jesus make between leadership among
                    His followers and leadership in the world? Mark 10:42-45.

                       "Christ was establishing a kingdom on different principles.
                    He called men, not to authority, but to service, the strong to

                      What do the following examples suggest are some of the
                    duties of the leader in the church? 1 Peter 5:2; Ezek. 33:8.

                       The spiritual leader is not only to teach sound doctrine and
                    feed his congregation; he has also to rebuke and warn. Through
                    the prophet Ezekiel, God points out the serious consequences
                    to a watchman who is not faithful in his duties.

                       What do the following passages suggest are the kind of
                    leaders the wicked usually look for? Isa. 30:10; 2 Tim. 4:3, 4.


                       Wicked or indifferent people do not want to hear the truth,
                    because the truth hurts. They want to hear compliments and
                    compromises, rationalizations that will enable them to con-
                    tinue in their present ways and enjoy present pleasures.
                       The tragedy of the world situation is that there are only too
                    many leaders who are willing to be popular. They do not
                    blatantly stand for wrong or error, but they minimize the serious-
                    ness of sin. They present an attitude of understanding reason-
                    ableness that wins favor and support.

 THINK IT THROUGH     Do we follow a leader because he pleases us, or because
                    he speaks the truth? Do we attend a church where we are
                    entertained, or where we are led into service? Why?


                      "To neglect or despise those whom God has appointed to
                    bear the responsibilities of leadership in connection with the
                    advancement of the truth, is to reject the means that He has
                    ordained for the help, encouragement, and strength of His
                    people."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 164.

           Part 3     "For I was alive without the law once: but when the com-
 ATTITUDE TO LAW mandment came, sin revived, and I died. And the command-
                   ment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death. For
       Rom. 7:9-12 sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and
                     by it slew me. Wherefore the law is holy, and the command-
                     ment holy, and just, and good."

                         The true people of God recognize that God's law is a tran-
                     script of His character. It is therefore perfect and immutable.
                     It points out sin and may be very unpleasant, but it is never-
                     theless good. To be rid of sin we do not get rid of the law, but
                     we must be rid of the basic cause for sinning.
                         What does Paul say about the law itself and his relation to
                     it? Rom. 7:9-12.

                        The law of God has been the subject of attack down through
                     the centuries. Satan in heaven "sought to prove that God was
                     unjust, that His law was faulty, and that the good of the uni-
                     verse required it to be changed."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
                     page 69. He has always tempted man to disobey, with the sug-
                     gestion that disobedience would lead to freedom and a godlike
                     status. But Christ came to reveal that God's law cannot be set
                     aside. Man may have sold himself to Satan by sin, but the
                     gospel provides the power whereby he may live free from sin
                     in harmony with God's law. Disobedience can only bring death,
                     while, obedience brings happiness and joy.
                        One of Satan's masterpieces of deception is his persuasion
                     of an organization to claim the power to change God's law.
                     This development was foreseen by Daniel in vision. Dan. 7:25.
                     Many commentators and Bible scholars recognize that the
                     power that thinks it can "change times and laws" is the papacy.
                     Although the change from keeping the seventh-day Sabbath to
                     the 'keeping of Sunday in memorial of the resurrection came
                     early in the history of the church and became a widespread
                     practice before the papacy was fully developed, yet the papacy
                     sanctioned the change and has claimed the right to make such
                     a change.
 THINK IT THROUGH       Why is it that Satan succeeds in deceiving so many people
                     regarding God's law? How would you show that it is a privilege
                     to keep God's law?

                        "In the closing work of God in the earth, the standard of
                     His law will be again exalted. False religion may prevail, iniq-
                     uity may abound, the love of many may wax cold, the cross of
                     Calvary may be lost sight of, and darkness, like the pall of
                     death, may spread over the world; the whole force of the pop-
                     ular current may be turned against the truth; plot after plot may
                     be formed to overthrow the people of God; but in the hour of
                     greatest peril the God of Elijah will raise up human instru-
                     mentalities to bear a message that will not be silenced."—

A Counterfeit People      LESSON 5                                  ❑ Wednesday
                                                                       August I

           Part 4   "The chief priests and the elders of the people came unto
                  him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority doest
      AUTHORITY thou  these things? and who gave thee this authority?"
      Matt. 21:23
                       There are two sources of authority—the human and the
                    divine. The human source is legitimate, but limited in scope.
                    The divine source is beyond question. When the Jewish leaders
                    approached Jesus and asked Him about His authority, they
                    knew that He had no human authority. When Jesus asked them
                    about the baptism of John, they were silent, because they did
                    not want to admit the possibility of a divine commission that
                    was not subject to the human. But the truth remains that the
                    highest authority on earth is the authority of God.
                      When the apostles were asked to desist from preaching
                    Christ, what did they say? Acts 4:19; 5:29.

                       In our complex society there are many sources of authority.
                    There are our parents whom we are expected to honor in har-
                    mony with the fifth commandment. There are our rulers to whom
                    we are to be subject. There are spiritual leaders who should
                    be respected. There is the authority of the church meeting in
                    counsel and deciding matters in harmony with the Spirit of
                    God. But we must recognize that anything human is liable to
                    error, and every decision must be evaluated in terms of God's
                    overall plans and purposes. Jesus put the matter baldly when
                    He said: "He that loveth father or mother more than me is not
                    worthy of me." Matt. 10:37.
                       It is a human trait of character to want to compel obedience.
                    Some have waged war and gone out to persecute.
                       What did Jesus say to James and John when they wanted
                    to call down fire from heaven to destroy the Samaritans be-
                    cause they had been inhospitable to Jesus? Luke 9:55, 56.

                      Those who go out to destroy life, however legitimate the
                    cause may appear, are not following in the footsteps of Jesus.
                    Any organization, however religious, that "makes war with the
                    saints" is thereby indicating a spirit that is not of Christ.
 THINK IT THROUGH     Although the Christian does not persecute, why is he often
                    persecuted? 1 John 3:11, 12; 2 Tim. 3:12.

                       "Jesus does not present to His followers the hope of attain-
                    ing earthly glory and riches, of living a life free from trial. In-
                    stead He calls upon them to follow Him in the path of self-denial
                    and reproach....
                       "So it will be with all who will live godly in Christ Jesus.
                    Persecution and reproach await all who are imbued with the
                    Spirit of Christ. The character of the persecution changes with
                    the times, but the principle—the spirit that underlies it—is the
                    same that has slain the chosen of the Lord ever since the days
                    of Abel."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 576.

A Counterfeit People LESSON 5                                         ❑ Thursday
                                                                        August 2
          Part 5       "For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of
                     yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man
     SALVATION:      should boast."
 WORKS OR FAITH?
      Eph. 2:8, 9        There is an apparent tension between faith and works. Man
                     has a tendency to want to earn salvation. Yet he is constantly
                     being reminded that salvation is the result of faith. One thing
                     is certain: it is Jesus who saves from sin (Matt. 1:21). And a
                     man shows that he has been saved by the way he lives, that
                     is, by his works (James 2:18).
                         What does Paul point out as being characteristic of false
                     religion? Rom. 1:21-23.

                        It is worthy of note that Paul points out in his letter to the
                     Romans that people who follow a false religion do not do so
                     out of ignorance: "They knew God." They deliberately chose
                     not to glorify God and not to be grateful for what He has done
                     for them. Cain doubtless knew God, but he decided not to rec-
                     ognize Him.
                        "The class of worshipers who follow the example of Cain
                     includes by far the greater portion of the world; for nearly
                     every false religion has been based on the same principle—
                     that man can depend upon his own efforts for salvation. It is
                     claimed by some that the human race is in need, not of redemp-
                     tion, but of development—that it can refine, elevate, and regen-
                     erate itself."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 73.
                        What feature of the parable of the laborers teaches that
                     salvation does not depend on the amount of good works a
                     person may have performed? Matt. 20:1-16.

                        "Not the amount of labor performed or its visible results but
                     the spirit in which the work is done makes it of value with
                     God. Those who came into the vineyard at the eleventh hour
                     were thankful for an opportunity to work."—Christ's Object
                     Lessons, page 397.
 THINK IT THROUGH      How can the Christian avoid a legalistic approach to the
                     keeping of the commandments? Why cannot the Christian be
                     saved without the keeping of the law?

                        "Before the believer is held out the wonderful possibility of
                     being like Christ, obedient to all the principles of the law. But
                     of himself man is utterly unable to reach this condition. The
                     holiness that God's word declared he must have before he
                     can be saved is the result of the working of divine grace as he
                     bows in submission to the discipline and restraining influences
                     of the Spirit of truth. Man's obedience can be made perfect
                     only by the incense of Christ's righteousness, which fills with
                     divine fragrance every act of obedience."—The Acts of the

          Part 6       "And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out
                    of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and
  A WARNING AND     that ye receive not of her plagues."
  AN ADMONITION
       Rev. 18:4       Just as in the days of Noah people had to make a decision
                    whether they would go into the ark or not, so in the last days
                    People are going to be invited to leave a religious organiza-
                    tion called Babylon, because Babylon represents all that is
                    against God's truth. This means that everyone must know the
                    difference between truth and error and must make a decision
                    for truth.
                        In the prophecy of the symbolic two-horned beast, what
                    issue is foretold as facing mankind in the last days? Rev. 13:15.
                       At the time of the end there will be two classes of people:
                    those who "worship him that made heaven, and earth" (Rev.
                    14:7), and those who worship the dragon and the beast and
                    the image to the beast (Rev. 13:4, 15). The conflict will lead
                    to economic sanctions and a death decree. Rev. 13:17. One
                    group has the seal of God, and the other group has the mark
                    of the beast. Rev. 7:3; 13:16. The Sabbath is a memorial of
                    creation, and those who keep it indicate that they worship the
                    Creator of heaven and earth. The mark of the beast must be
                    a feature that indicates the worship of the beast, and the ac-
                    ceptance of the beast's authority. Since it is opposed to the
                    Sabbath, it must mean the keeping of a day distinct from the
                    Sabbath and authorized by the beast. The keeping of Sunday
                    under coercion, in direct opposition to the keeping of the Sab-
                    bath, is the mark of the beast.

                      Why is it true that Sunday keepers do not now have the
                    mark of the beast?

                       "There are many who have never had an opportunity to hear
                    the special truths for this time. The obligation of the fourth
                    commandment has never been set before them in its true light.
                    He who reads every heart and tries every motive will leave none
                    who desire a knowledge of the truth, to be deceived as to the
                    issues of the controversy."—The Great Controversy, page 605.

 THINK IT THROUGH      How do you think the Christian should get ready for the
                    conflict that is ahead of us? What kind of Sabbath keeping can
                    be identified with the seal of God?

                       "Among earth's inhabitants, scattered in every land, there
                    are those who have not bowed the knee to Baal. Like the stars
                    of heaven, which appear only at night, these faithful ones will
                    shine forth when darkness covers the earth and gross darkness
                    the people.... God has in reserve a firmament of chosen ones
                    that will yet shine forth amidst the darkness, revealing clearly
                    to an apostate world the transforming power of obedience to
                    His law."—Prophets and Kings, pages 188, 189.

                                                                            August 5

          Part 1     "God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in
                  trouble. Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be re-
    CONSTANT IN moved,   and though the mountains be carried into the midst of
      ADVERSITY the sea."
      Ps. 46:1, 2
                       God's people are a faithful people because God is a faithful
                    God in whom they can place absolute trust and confidence. God
                    has chosen them; He loves them; He has made a covenant with
                    them; and He will keep His word with them forever. Deut. 7:9.
                        If God is so good to His people, how is it that they often
                    fall into adverse circumstances? John 16:33.

                       It is an inevitable part of life in this world that the Christian
                    will face trouble not of his own making. God is able to protect
                    and keep believers, but He does not necessarily prevent ar-
                    rests or imprisonment or unjust treatment. The constancy of the
                    Christian under trial is part of his witness to a true and loving
                    God.
                      What are some of the values of passing through tribulation?
                    Rom. 5:3; 2 Cor. 1:4.

                       Pain is always difficult to bear, but pain and sorrow that re-
                    sult in good can be welcomed. Can we glory in tribulations as
                    Paul said he did? Do we recognize that when we pass through
                    a difficult experience we can sympathize more with other peo-
                    ple and point them to the source of comfort and help?
                       What does Peter say is the cause of rejoicing in tribulations?
                    1 Peter 4:12, 13.

                       It is paradoxical that people can be happy and contented
                    while suffering hardships. They are able to do so because they
                    trust God who has permitted the experiences, and the Holy
                    Spirit aids them in viewing the situation from a Christian view-
                    point.
 THINK IT THROUGH      What is it that enables a Christian to put up with persecu-
                    tion and unjust treatment? Do you think a Christian ought to
                    fight for his rights?

                       "No cross, no crown. How can one be strong in the Lord
                    without trials? To have strength we must have exercise. To
                    have strong faith, we must be placed in circumstances where
                    our faith will be exercised. . . It is through much tribulation
                    that we are to enter the kingdom of God. Our Saviour was tried
                    in every possible way, and yet He triumphed in God contin-
                    ually. It is our privilege to be strong in the strength of God
                    under all circumstances and to glory in the cross of Christ."

             Part 2   "My God shall supply all your need according to his riches
      TRUSTING FOR in glory by Christ Jesus."
       THEIR NEEDS
          Phil. 4:19  God's faithful people have the assurance that their needs
                     will always be supplied. They never have to worry about food
                     or clothing.
                       Think: What is the difference between our needs and our
                     wants? To what extent does God supply our needs? Eph. 3:20.


                        Sometimes we think of needs as being barest essentials. We
                     admit that our bread and water are sure. But God is always
                     generous with His gifts. Consider the situation of Job before
                     his trials and after. Job 1:1-3; 42:10-16.
                        What are the dangers of wanting more than one has? 1 Tim.
                     6:9, 10.


                        Paul came from a well-to-do family, but when he entered
                     the service of God, there were times when he was in need.
                     Apparently he never grumbled. Phil. 4:11, 12.

                        What was Paul's secret of success in always being content
                     with what he had? Phil. 4:13.


                        The apostle points out that godliness with contentment is
                     great gain. Contrast the human tendency to covet.
                        "All things are possible to him that believeth; and whatso-
                     ever things we desire when we pray, if we believe that we
                     receive them we shall have them. This faith will penetrate the
                     darkest cloud and bring rays of light and hope to the drooping,
                     desponding soul. It is the absence of this faith and trust which
                     brings perplexity, distressing fears, and surmisings of evil. God
                     will do great things for His people when they put their entire
                     trust in Him."—Testimonies, Vol. 2, p. 140.
 THINK IT THROUGH      What is my greatest need?


                         "Our greatest need is faith in God. When we look on the
                     dark side we lose our hold on the Lord God of Israel. As the
                     heart is opened to fears and conjectures, the path of progress
                     is hedged up by unbelief. Let us never feel that God has for-
                     saken His work.
                         "There must be less talking of unbelief, less imagining that
                     this one and that one is hedging up the way. Go forward in
                     faith; trust the Lord to prepare the way for His work. Then you
                     will find rest in Christ."—Testimonies, Vol. 7, p. 211.

                                                                         August 7

           Part 3   "In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good
     LOYAL UNDER cheer; I have overcome the world."
          STRESS    Although the Christian enjoys many privileges, he is not
       John 16:33 guaranteed a life of ease. On the contrary, he is assured that
                    he will be the target of animosity in the world. Yet he need not
                    be distressed. The victory that Christ gained by maintaining
                    loyalty to God under the trial of hatred by men is a victory that
                    may be his.
                      What are some of the troubles that the Christian and the
                    church may reasonably expect? Luke 21:16.

                        Satan has always been angry with the people of God, but
                    in the last days his anger will know no bounds because he
                    knows that he has a short time. "Satan numbers the world as
                    his subjects; he has gained control even of many professing
                    Christians. But here is a little company who are resisting his
                    supremacy. If he could blot them from the earth, his triumph
                    would be complete. As he influenced the heathen nations to
                    destroy Israel, so in the near future he will stir up the wicked
                    powers of earth to destroy the people of God. Men will be
                    required to render obedience to human edicts in violation of
                     the divine law."—Prophets and Kings, pages 587, 588.
                        One of the ways Satan attacks the people of God is to point
                    out their sins and seek to discourage them. "Satan has an
                     accurate knowledge of the sins that he has tempted God's
                     people to commit, and he urges his accusations against them,
                     declaring that by their sins they have forfeited divine protec-
                     tion, and claiming that he has the right to destroy them."—
                     Prophets and Kings, page 588.
                       From Zechariah's vision about Joshua the high priest, what
                    lesson can we learn about the way the Lord defends the be-
                    liever when the accuser of the brethren presses his claims
                    against him? Zech. 3:2.

                       "But while the followers of Christ have sinned, they have
                    not given themselves up to be controlled by the satanic agen-
                    cies. They have repented of their sins and have sought the
                    Lord in humility and contrition; and the divine Advocate pleads
                    in their behalf."—Prophets and Kings, page 589.

 THINK IT THROUGH     Is there ever an excuse for doing wrong? What is it that
                    keeps us loyal to God under great duress? Rom. 8:31-39.

                       "Zechariah's vision of Joshua and the Angel applies with
                    peculiar force to the experience of God's people in the closing
                    up of the great day of atonement. The remnant church will be
                    brought into great trial and distress. . . .

                                                                        August 8

             Part 4     "For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels,
      GRATEFUL FOR nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things
                     to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall
       DELIVERANCE be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ
       Rom. 8:38, 39 Jesus our Lord."

                        God's people know that God is able to deliver them from
                     any kind of trouble, but whether He will do so in any set of
                     circumstances is something they cannot determine.
                        What experience in the Old Testament indicates that God
                     can, and does deliver, but that, whether He will do so or not,
                     is not known beforehand? Dan. 3:16-18.


                         "In vain were the king's threats. He could not turn the men
                     from their allegiance to the Ruler of the universe. From the
                     history of their fathers they had learned that disobedience to
                     God results in dishonor, disaster, and death; and that the fear
                     of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, the foundation of all
                     true prosperity."—Prophets and Kings, pages 507, 508.

                       What experience in the New Testament gave reason for the
                     early Christians to rejoice? Acts 12:5, 7, 11, 16.


                         God's people are convinced that God can deliver; but they
                     cannot be certain that He will always do so. There were many
                     times when God's servants were allowed to suffer the ire of
                     the enemy. John the Baptist was beheaded because of the
                     fancy and jealousy of a licentious woman. James suffered
                     martyrdom at the hands of a wicked king. Acts 12:1, 2. One
                     principle holds true in their lives. They would rather die than
                     commit a wrong deed. For death is not the greatest tragedy
                     that can come to anyone; the greatest tragedy is to lose the
                     fellowship of God and the angels throughout eternity.
 THINK IT THROUGH      Why is it always safe to do the right thing and leave the
                     outcome of rightdoing in the hands of God? Matt. 10:28.


                         "In the darkest days, when appearances seem most for-
                     bidding, have faith in God. He is working out His will, doing
                     all things well in behalf of His people. The strength of those
                     who love and serve Him will be renewed day by day."—The
                     Ministry of Healing, page 482.
                         "The consistent course is to commit our desires to our all-
                     wise heavenly Father, and then, in perfect confidence, trust
                     all to Him. We know that God hears us if we ask according to
                     His will. But to press our petitions without a submissive spirit
                     is not right; our prayers must take the form, not of command,
                     but of intercession."—The Ministry of Healing, page 230.

      BEFORE THE
                     Although there are many times when the Christian falls a
          ENEMY victim to the evil intentions of the enemy, there are many more
         Ps. 91:5 occasions when he experiences deliverance. Therefore he goes
                    about his duty, even in dangerous circumstances, with a trust
                    that all things will work out for good, even if he does not seem
                    to be protected.
                       What experience in the Old Testament shows that God pro-
                    tects His own? 1 Sam. 19:10.
                       "As Saul's hatred of David increased, he became more and
                    more watchful to find an opportunity to take his life; but none
                    of his plans against the anointed of the Lord were successful.
                    Saul gave himself up to the control of the wicked spirit that
                    ruled over him; while David trusted in Him who is mighty in
                    counsel, and strong to deliver."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page
                    651
                       God's deliverance and saving of life does not ensure that
                    the Christian who receives these blessings will thereafter es-
                    cape hardships and physical inconveniences. The Christian
                    looks upon the difficulties he encounters as challenges to fol-

                    11:24-27.

                      This attitude of not caring what may come to one in life's
                    experience so long as one is right must be frustrating to the
                    enemy. He finds the Christian invincible in spirit because of a
                    supreme trust in the goodness of God and in his final victory

                        and Christ in his daily life? Gal. 2:20.


                           "Christ changes the heart. He abides in your heart by faith.

                           Is there any lack in the Christian when Christ dwells fully
                        in him? Col. 2:10.


                            "Through faith in Christ, every deficiency of character may

                            God's people are obedient to God's commandments, not
                        because of any legalistic attitude of compulsion to do what is
                        distasteful, but because a power has come into their lives that
                        makes obedience not only a possibility, but a delight. They

                   that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make
      HIGH PRIEST intercession for them."
 AND INTERCESSOR
         Heb. 1:25
                         The question is often asked: What is Jesus doing now? The
                     answer is that He is ministering in the heavenly sanctuary as
                     our great .High Priest. Heb. 4:14.
                         On the cross Jesus gained a signal victory over sin, and
                     by His resurrection He broke the bands of death. Thus He
                     provided a full and free salvation for everyone, but not everyone
                     takes advantage of this provision. Many in the end will be lost.
                     It is only those who repent and believe who will be saved,
                     saved because what was accomplished on earth by Jesus is
                     made applicable to them by the priestly ministry of Jesus in
                     heaven.
                         "The great Sacrifice had been offered and had been ac-
                     cepted, and the Holy Spirit which descended on the day of
                     Pentecost carried the minds of the disciples from the earthly
                     sanctuary to the heavenly, where Jesus had entered by His
                     own blood, to shed upon His disciples the benefits of His atone-
                     ment."—Early Writings, page 260.
                        What is it that makes Jesus a faithful High Priest? Heb.
                     2:17, 18.

                        In the incarnation Jesus became one with man. He was
                     tempted in all points possible to man. In this way man is as-
                     sured that Christ fully understands the plight of man and can
                     save him "to the uttermost." Therefore we can come "boldly
                     unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find
                     grace to help in time of need." Heb. 4:16.
                        The good news of the gospel is not only that Christ died for
                     us and rose again, but that "he ever liveth to make interces-
                     sion" for us. Heb. 7:25; Rom. 8:34. He is the one Mediator
                     between God and man (1 Tim. 2:5); and as He intercedes for
                     His true disciples, they are assured that their names will not
                     be blotted out of the book of life. Rev. 3:5.

 THINK IT THROUGH       What is the work of an intercessor? What will happen on
                     earth when Christ's work of intercession ceases?


                        "When He leaves the sanctuary, darkness covers the in-
                     habitants of the earth. In that fearful time the righteous must
                     live in the sight of a holy God without an intercessor. The

           Part 2     "Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the
                    world."
  THE LAMB SLAIN
        John 1:29
                        Jesus is not only the High Priest of the heavenly sanctuary;
                    He is also the offering. "As in the typical service the high
                    priest laid aside his pontifical robes and officiated in the white
                    linen dress of an ordinary priest; so Christ laid aside His royal
                    robes and garbed Himself with humanity and offered sacrifice,
                    Himself the priest, Himself the victim."—The Acts of the Apos-
                    tles, page 33.
                       Why did Jesus have to die in order to save humanity? Heb.
                    9:22.

                       "The Lord does not save sinners by abolishing His law, the
                    foundation of His government in heaven and in earth. The pun-
                    ishment has been endured by the sinner's substitute. Not that
                    God is cruel and merciless, and Christ so merciful that He died
                    on Calvary's cross to abolish a law so arbitrary that it needed
                    to be extinguished, crucified between two thieves. The throne
                    of God must not bear one stain of crime, one taint of sin. In
                    the councils of heaven, before the world was created, the
                    Father and the Son convenanted together that if man proved
                    disloyal to God, Christ, one with the Father, would take the
                    place of the transgressor, and suffer the penalty of justice that
                    must fall upon him."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible

                       "Every morning and evening a lamb of a year old was burned
                    upon the altar.... Only an offering 'without blemish' could be
                    a symbol of His perfect purity who was to offer Himself as a

                    love that is measureless. We endeavor to tell of this love, and
                    language fails us. We consider His life on earth, His sacrifice
                    for us, His work in heaven as our advocate, and the mansions

              Part 3      "So then, have your minds ready for action. Keep alert, and
      STANDARD OF      set your hope completely on the blessing which will be given
                       you when Jesus Christ is revealed. Be obedient to God, and
        PERFECTION     do not allow your lives to be shaped by those desires you had
1 Peter 1:13.16, TEY   when you were still ignorant. Instead, be holy in all that you
                       do, just as God who called you is holy. Scripture says, 'You
                       must be holy, because I am holy.' "

                         Since God has done so much for us, it seems only reason-
                       able that we should devote our lives to Him. Since He, a holy
                       God, is our pattern, we, His people, must be holy too.
                          What are the characteristics that Peter counsels his readers
                       to possess? 1 Peter 1:13-16.

                           a. They are mentally active and intelligent about their faith
                       (cf. 1 Cor. 14:20).
                           b. They have a serious purpose and exercise self-control.
                           c. They look forward to the second coming of Jesus and
                       the privileges that will come to them at that time.
                           d. They keep God's commandments and seek to do His will
                       in every phase of their lives.
                           e. They turn their backs on the world and its allurements.
                           f. They commit themselves to God's service and enjoy com-
                       munion with Him.
                           They do all this gladly because they know that they have
                       been redeemed by the costly sacrifice of Christ. 1 Peter 1:19.
                          How can the Christian attain such a high standard of Chris-
                       tian living? 1 Peter 1:23.

                          Just as a man cannot lift himself up by his bootstraps, so
                       man cannot change his evil nature by good resolutions; he
                       must be reborn into another family. The Word that created
                       the universe must re-create him, and this God has promised to
                       do for all those who will accept Him.

                       from the world?

                          "The leaven of truth works a change in the whole man,
                       making the coarse refined, the rough gentle, the selfish gen-
                       erous. By it the impure are cleansed, washed in the blood of

                       Man with his human nature becomes a partaker of divinity.
                       Christ is honored in excellence and perfection of character. As
                       these changes are effected, angels break forth in rapturous

                                                                        August 15

             Part 4 "But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and
          GROWING Saviour Jesus Christ."
      INTO CHRIST
       2 Peter 3:18 Everyone is familiar with growth and development. Wherever
                     there is life, there is growth. Spiritual growth is a phenomenon
                     just as real as physical growth. It is equally dependent on the
                     source of all life and subject to similar principles of environ-
                     ment, nourishment, and nurture.
                        How dependent is man upon God for all growth? Matt. 6:27.

                        "In the matchless gift of His Son, God has encircled the
                     whole world with an atmosphere of grace as real as the air
                     which circulates around the globe. All who choose to breathe
                     this life-giving atmosphere will live and grow up to the stature
                     of men and women in Christ Jesus."—Steps to Christ, page 68.
                        What is the main element for Christian growth? 1 Peter 2:2.


                        "If we would live a true Christian life, the conscience must
                     be quickened by constant contact with the word of God. All
                     the precious things which at infinite cost God has provided for
                     us will do us no good; they cannot strengthen us and produce
                     spiritual growth unless we appropriate them. We must eat the
                     word of God—make it a part of ourselves."—Testimonies, Vol.
                     7, p. 195.
                       How did Jesus say His disciples could grow spiritually?
                     John 15:4, 5.

                         "Our growth in grace, our joy, our usefulness,—all depend
                     upon our union with Christ. It is by communion with Him, daily,
                     hourly,—by abiding in Him,—that we are to grow in grace. He
                     is not only the Author, but the Finisher of our faith. It is Christ
                     first and last and always."—Steps to Christ, page 69.
                         It is a great privilege to grow and develop. But one must
                     guard against an inordinate concern about his salvation. "We
                     should not make self the center and indulge anxiety and fear
                     as to whether we shall be saved. All this turns the soul away
                     from the Source of our strength. Commit the keeping of your
                     soul to God, and trust in Him."—Steps to Christ, page 72.
  THINK IT THROUGH      How should I study the Bible in order to grow in grace?


                        "Consecrate yourself to God in the morning; make this your
                     very first work. Let your prayer be, 'Take me, 0 Lord, as wholly
                     Thine. I lay all my plans at Thy feet. Use me today in Thy ser-
                     vice. Abide with me, and let all my work be wrought in Thee.' "

              Part 5    "For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also
                     suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow
       IN HIS STEPS his steps."
        1 Peter 2:21
                        Just as children resemble their parents in a number of char-
                     acteristics, so God's people are to be distinguished by living
                     on earth just as Jesus lived.
                         What is one reason that it is important for the Christian to
                     live a Christlike life? Matt. 4:19.

                         "It is not only by preaching the truth, not only by distribut-
                     ing literature, that we are to witness for God. Let us remember
                     that a Christlike life is the most powerful argument that can be
                     advanced in favor of Christianity, and that a cheap Christian
                     character works more harm in the world than the character of
                     a worldling. . . . Men will believe, not what the minister
                     preaches, but what the church lives."—Testimonies, Vol. 9,
                     p. 21.
                       What is the evidence to the world that a believer is a true
                     Christian? John 13:35.

                          "No value is attached to a mere profession of faith in Christ;
                     only the love which is shown by works is counted genuine. Yet
                     it is love alone which in the sight of Heaven makes any act of
                     value."—The Great Controversy, page 487.
                         "The law of love calls for the devotion of body, mind, and
                     soul to the service of God and our fellow men. And this service,
                     while making us a blessing to others, brings the greatest bless-
                     ing to ourselves."—Education, page 16.
                        With what two features does Luke sum up the earthly life
                     of Jesus? Acts 10:38.

                         Just as Jesus lived to bless others, so the Christian is to be
                     a center of love, light, and comfort to all. Isa. 58:7, 8. "Prac-
                     tical work will have far more effect than mere sermonizing.
                     . . . If Christ is abiding in us, our hearts will be full of divine
                     sympathy. The sealed fountains of earnest, Christlike love will
                     be unsealed."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 417.
 THINK IT THROUGH        Why is a loving and lovable Christian the strongest argument
                     for Christianity?
                         "The badge of Christianity is not an outward sign, not the
                     wearing of a cross or a crown, but it is that which reveals the
                     union of man with God. By the power of His grace manifested
                     in the transformation of character the world is to be convinced
                     that God has sent His Son as its Redeemer. No other influence
                     that can surround the human soul has such power as the in-
                     fluence of an unselfish life."—The Ministry of Healing, page

           Part 6        What evidence did Jesus give of the disciples' status as His
                     friends?
  FRIENDS RATHER
   THAN SERVANTS
        John 15:15      "Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth
                     not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all
                     things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto
                     you."


                        The prodigal son returned to his father and offered to be
                     one of his hired servants. But the father would not think of it.
                     He treated him like an honored son, and rejoiced that he had
                     returned. So it is with Jesus and His people. He died for them;
                     He pleads for them; He treats them much better than they
                     deserve; and then He takes them into His counsel and con-
                     siders them His friends.
                        What was the relationship of God to Moses that prompted
                     the analogy of human friendship to describe it? Ex. 33:11.
                        What made Abraham a friend of God? James 2:23.


                         "Abraham, 'the friend of God,' set us a worthy example. His
                     was a life of prayer. Wherever he pitched his tent, close beside
                     it was set up his altar, calling all within his encampment to the
                     morning and evening sacrifice. When his tent was removed,
                     the altar remained. In following years, there were those among
                     the roving Canaanites who received instruction from Abraham;
                     and whenever one of these came to that altar, he . . . repaired
                     the altar and there worshiped the living God."—Patriarchs
                     and Prophets, page 128.

 THINK IT THROUGH       What has Jesus revealed to His friends?


                        "What is our profession? We profess to be following Christ.
                     We claim to be Christians. Do we, then, reveal the Christlike-
                     ness? Do we serve the Saviour intelligently? Does the love of
                     God continually flow from us to others? Do we, in word and
                     action, confess our Redeemer? Do we conform our lives to His
                     holy principles? Are we pure and undefiled? Christians must
                     hold the beginning of their confidence firm unto the end. It is
                     not enough to profess the faith. There must be a patient en-
                     durance of all trials and a brave resistance to all temptations.
                     Faith can be maintained only by bringing the Christian religion
                     to the test of practice, thus demonstrating its transforming
                     power and the faithfulness of its promises."—Ellen G. White

           Part 1     "And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham
                   to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones
      CONFIDENCE to raise up children unto Abraham."
     IN ANCESTRY
         Matt. 3:9
                        Ancestry can be a great privilege, and family connections
                     are always important, but when it comes to salvation it is the
                     personal decision that is vital.
                        What claims could Paul make as far as family connections
                     were concerned, and what was his attitude toward them? Phil.
                     3:4-7.
                         We must not deny the advantages that come to us as a result
                     of inheritance. We can always thank God for good constitutions,
                     strong mental powers, and an environment in which we have
                     learned of the truth from early years. But these blessings come
                     as challenges, and lay solemn responsibilities upon us to live
                     up to the light and the privileges we enjoy. They are talents
                     that we can use to God's glory. It is when we assume that be-
                     cause we have these things we can automatically enter the
                     kingdom that we make a mistake.
                        What was the teaching of Jesus in regard to family connec-
                     tions and salvation? John 8:39; Matt. 8:11, 12.

                         "Christ recognized no virtue in lineage. He taught that spir-
                     itual connection supersedes all natural connection. The Jews
                     claimed to have descended from Abraham; but by failing to do
                     the works of Abraham, they proved that they were not his true
                     children. Only those who prove themselves to be spiritually
                     in harmony with Abraham by obeying the voice of God, are
                     reckoned as of true descent."—Christ's Object Lessons, page
                     268.
                         "The Jews regarded their natural descent from Abraham
                      as giving them a claim to this promise. But they overlooked
                      the conditions which God had specified."—The Desire of Ages,
                      page 106.
  THINK IT THROUGH      Should we blame the Jew today for the mistakes his ances-
                     tors made many centuries ago? Why is it not right to claim a
                     right to heaven on the basis of parentage?

                         "To a people in whose hearts His law is written, the favor
                      of God is assured. They are one with Him. But the Jews had
                      separated themselves from God. Because of their sins they
                      were suffering under His judgments. This was the cause of
                      their bondage to a heathen nation. Their minds were darkened
                      by transgression, and because in times past the Lord had
                      shown them so great favor, they excused their sins. They flat-
                      tered themselves that they were better than other men, and

              Part 2   "And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in
        CONFIDENCE themselves that they were righteous, and despised others."
          IN WORKS     it is very easy to take pride in what we have done, especially
           Luke 18:9 when people praise us. This does not mean that we should
                     cease to do good works, but it does mean that when people
                     compliment us we should be sure to give God the glory.
                        On what basis will some religious people seek entrance to
                     the kingdom of God? Matt. 7:21-23. What does Jesus say to "
                     them? Verse 23.

                        "Saddest of all words that ever fell on mortal ear are those
                     words of doom, 'I know you not.' "—Christ's Object Lessons,
                     page 413.
                        The relationship between works and faith is an important
                     one. It is possible to engage in works without faith, but this
                     kind of activity is worthless. Some people emphasize faith to
                     the detriment of works, but this is also false. James 2:20. Works
                     must be the natural result of the life of faith, the fruit that is
                     borne by one who abides in Christ. John 15:4.
                        What was one result of certain Jews taking pride in their
                     righteousness? Luke 18:9.

                          "Whoever trusts in himself that he is righteous, will despise
                     others. As the Pharisee judges himself by other men, so he
                     judges other men by himself. His righteousness is estimated
                     by theirs, and the worse they are the more righteous by con-
                     trast he appears. His self-righteousness leads to accusing.
                     . . . Thus he is making manifest the very spirit of Satan, the
                     accuser of the brethren. With this spirit it is impossible for
                     him to enter into communion with God."—Christ's Object Les-
                     sons, page 151.
                         Most false religions teach that one moves upward by coun-
                     terbalancing evil deeds with righteous ones, that a surplus of
                     righteous deeds will ensure salvation. But the Bible teaches
                     otherwise. Ezek. 33:13-16. A man determines his destiny by his
                     decisions, not his works.
 THINK IT THROUGH       What should we do when we do not feel like keeping the
                     Sabbath or paying the tithe? Should we discipline ourselves
                     to do what is right?

                        "No outward observances can take the place of simple faith
                     and entire renunciation of self. But no man can empty himself
                     of self. We can only consent for Christ to accomplish the work.
                     Then the language of the soul will be, Save me in spite of
                     myself, my weak, unchristlike self. Lord, take my heart; for I
                     cannot give it. It is Thy property. Keep it pure, for I cannot
                     keep it for Thee. Mold me, fashion me, raise me into a pure
                     and holy atmosphere, where the rich current of Thy love can
                     flow through my soul."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 159.

                                                                          August 21

              Part 3    "But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall
        CONFIDENCE be   required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which
                     thou hast provided?"
          IN RICHES
         Luke 12:20     Contrary to the opinion of many, a man's life is not fulfilled
                       when he owns many things. Rather, his many possessions may
                       be a source of embarrassment.
                          What dangers does Paul point out as inherent in the desire
                       for money? 1 Tim. 6:9, 10.
                           Riches are often thought of as a kind of insurance in a world
                       where nothing seems to be sure. But many have found to their
                       sorrow that riches can disappear overnight. We are not to
                       strive for riches, although wealth may come our way as a result
                       of God's blessing or of God's test. Our trust must be placed
                       in the living God.
                          Why did a would-be follower of Jesus make the wrong deci-
                       sion? Luke 18:23-25.
                          "The lover of self is a transgressor of the law. This Jesus
                       desired to reveal to the young man, and He gave him a test
                       that would make manifest the selfishness of his heart. He
                       showed him the plague spot in his character. The young man
                       desired no further enlightenment. He had cherished an idol
                       in the soul; the world was his god. He professed to have kept
                       the commandments, but he was destitute of the principle which
                       is the very spirit and life of them all. He did not possess true
                       love for God or man. This want was the want of everything that
                       would qualify him to enter the kingdom of heaven. In his love
                       of self and worldly gain he was out of harmony with the prin-
                       ciples of heaven."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 392.
                          What is the believer's true wealth? James 2:5.

                         There is no virtue in poverty for poverty's sake, although
                       many Christians have given up their wealth for the sake of the
                       gospel. The point is that the Christian must center his life on
                       Christ and His service, and not on the world and what the
                       world can offer.
    THINK IT THROUGH      Why is it that some people are materially rich and some
                       are poor?
                          "To the rich no less than to the poor are the words of the
                       Holy Spirit spoken, 'Ye are not your own; for ye are bought
                       with a price.' 1 Cor. 6:19, 20. When men believe this, their
                       possessions will be held as a trust, to be used as God shall
                       direct, for the saving of the lost, and the comfort of the suffer-
                       ing and the poor. . . . By beholding the matchless love of
                       Christ, the selfish heart will be melted and subdued."—Christ's

A Confident People LESSON 8                                          111 Wednesday
                                                                          August 22

               Part 4   "Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet,
                      Hear now, Hananiah; The Lord hath not sent thee; but thou
        CONFIDENCE makest   this people to trust in a lie."
      IN FALSEHOOD
           kr. 28:15    Strange as it may seem, some people would rather believe
                     a lie than the truth. This was the case in the days of Jeremiah
                     when the people were told that they would have to go into
                     captivity because of their sin, but they did not want to acknowl-
                     edge their sin or accept their fate. See Jer. 27:6-11. Hananiah's
                     fate was certainly a terrible one, and a warning to all time-
                     servers.
                        What kind of people will definitely be outside the kingdom
                     of heaven? Rev. 21:27.

                         We are told that in the latter days people "will not stand
                     wholesome teaching, but will follow their own fancy and gather
                     a crowd of teachers to tickle their ears. They will stop their
                     ears to the truth and turn to mythology." 2 Tim. 4:3, 4, NEB.
                         Paul, writing to the Romans, points out that everyone can
                     know about God because nature reveals ''his eternal power
                     and Godhead." Rom. 1:20. When people turn away from God,
                     it is not because of ignorance, but by deliberate choice. The
                     result of such decision is clearly shown in verses 22-32.
                         The apostle John tells us that Jesus is the "true Light, which
                     lighteth every man that cometh into the world" (John 1:9), so
                     that those who do not accept the light are those who do not
                     want to see it.
                       What power did Paul describe as coming before the second
                     coming of Jesus? 2 Thess. 2:3-11.

                         It is those who do not love the truth in order to be saved
                     that will be deceived by the mystery of iniquity (2 Thess. 2:10).
                     Their decision having been made, God sends them a strong
                     delusion and they "believe a lie," apparently with all sincerity.
                     We must not be deceived by sincerity, but differentiate between
                     truth and error.
 THINK IT THROUGH       In view of the widespread acceptance of error, what do you
                     think the Christian ought to be doing?

                     Adventists and the fallen churches, and before the plagues
                     shall be poured out, ministers and people will be called out
                     from these churches and will gladly receive the truth. Satan
                     knows this; and before the loud cry of the third angel is given,
                     he raises an excitement in these religious bodies, that those
                     who have rejected the truth may think that God is with them.
                     He hopes to deceive the honest and lead them. to think that
                     God is still working for the churches. But the light will shine,
                     and all who are honest will leave the fallen churches, and take

A Confident People       LESSON 8                                     ❑ Thursday
                                                                        August 23

            Part 5    "The Lord did not set his love upon you, nor choose you,
                    because ye were more in number than any people; for ye were
      CONFIDENCE the fewest of all people."
      IN NUMBERS
          Deut. 1:1
                         There is nothing wrong in numbers, for there are myriads
                     of angels that serve God; and God promised Abraham that his
                     seed would be "as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand
                     which is upon the sea shore." Gen. 22:17. What is dangerous
                     is that we place confidence in numbers rather than in God.

                        What experience of the children of Israel shows that God
                     does not need numbers in order to grant a victory? Judges
                     7:2-7.


                        People generally feel more confident when they have num-
                     bers on their side. They feel that large numbers, of people
                     cannot be wrong. But truth is not always with the majority;
                     often it is with the minority. Therefore a person must know
                     what he believes because he understands the truth and he has
                     asked the Holy Spirit to guide him.
                        "In comparison with the millions of the world, God's people
                     will be, as they have ever been, a little flock; but if they stand
                     for the truth as revealed in His word, God will be their refuge.
                     They stand under the broad shield of Omnipotence. God is
                     always a majority."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 590.
                        What was the true secret of success for Judah after the
                     exile? Zech. 4:6.


                        "As the chosen people of God we cannot copy the habits,
                     aims, practices, or fashions of the world. We are not left in
                     darkness to pattern after worldly models and to depend on
                     outward appearance for success. . . . As the Lord sees fit, He
                     imparts to those who keep His way, power that enables them
                     to exert a strong influence for good. On God they are depen-
                     dent, and to Him they must give an account of the way in which
                     they use the talents He has entrusted to them."—Testimonies,
                     Vol. 7, p. 90.

  THINK IT THROUGH      Why is it unsafe to gauge the importance of a church by the
                      number of its members?


                         "Not in our learning, not in our position, not in our numbers
                      or entrusted talents, not in the will of man, is to be found the
                      secret of success. Feeling our inefficiency we are to contem-
                      plate Christ, and through Him who is the strength of all strength,
                      the thought of all thought, the willing and obedient will gain
                      victory after victory."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 404.

              Part 6    "Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three
                     thousand men go up and smite Ai; and make not all the people
        CONFIDENCE to  labour thither; for they are but few."
            IN SELF
          Joshua 1:3    After the signal capture of Jericho the children of Israel
                     felt they could take Ai without any difficulty. "The great vic-
                     tory that God had gained for them had made the Israelites
                     self-confident. Because He had promised them the land of
                     Canaan they felt secure, and failed to realize that divine help
                     alone could give them success. Even Joshua laid his plans for
                     the conquest of Ai without seeking counsel from God."—Pa-
                     triarchs and Prophets, page 493.
                        On whom did Jesus depend? John 5:30.

                         "Christ in His life on earth made no plans for Himself. He
                     accepted God's plans for Him, and day by day the Father un-
                     folded His plans. So should we depend upon God, that our
                     lives may be the simple outworking of His will. As we commit
                     our ways to Him, He will direct our steps."—The Ministry of
                     Healing, page 479.
                        What danger is there in self-confidence? 1 Cor. 10:12.

                         "Those who accept Christ, and in their first confidence say,
                     I am saved, are in danger of trusting to themselves. They lose
                     sight of their own weakness and their constant need of divine
                     strength. They are unprepared for Satan's devices, and under
                     temptation many, like Peter, fall into the very depths of sin.
                     . . . Our only safety is in constant distrust of self, and de-
                     pendence on Christ."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 155.
                         Self-confidence often leads to dogmatism, and dogmatism
                     leads to persecution. While the church needs to be positive
                     in its teaching, it must never be arrogant or make claims for
                     itself that cannot be substantiated. The power of the church
                     is not in its size or wealth or position, but in its close connec-
                     tion with God as His appointed agency for the salvation of men.
 THINK IT THROUGH       When is it proper to have a reasonable confidence in one-
                     self, and when is it dangerous?

                        "As men rejoice in the freedom which the truth brings them,
                     they are inclined to extol those whom God has employed to
                     break the chains of error and superstition. Satan seeks to
                     divert men's thoughts and affections from God, and to fix them
                     upon human agencies; He leads them to honor the mere in-
                     strument and to ignore the Hand that directs all the events of
                     providence. Too often religious leaders who are thus praised
                     and reverenced lose sight of their dependence upon God and
                     are led to trust in themselves. As a result they seek to control
                     the minds and consciences of the people, who are disposed
                     to look to them for guidance instead of looking to the word
                     of God."—The Great Controversy, pages 169, 170.

Luke 21:12, 13, RSV mony."
                        Jesus told His disciples that they would be the object of
                    hatred and persecution. At the same time He assured them
                    of His protection and help. The apostle John foresaw the con-
                    flict between the dragon and the church and indicated that the
                    church would have to flee into the wilderness.

                      What do the following verses suggest as to why God's
                    people are the object of the hatred of the world? 1 John 3:12;
                    John 3:20.

                        "The brighter the heavenly light that is reflected from the
                    character of God's faithful servants, the more clearly the sins
                    of the ungodly are revealed, and the more determined will be
                    their efforts to destroy those who disturb their peace."—Pa-
                    triarchs and Prophets, page 74.
                        It is interesting to note that the devil with all his fury cannot
                    frustrate God's plans. Even in prison, the people of God have
                    a joy that cannot be quenched, and God's work goes forward.

                       Why are adverse circumstances a cause of joy for the Chris-
                    tian? James 1:2-4.

                        The Christian does not seek persecution. He prays: "Lead
                    us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil." Matt. 6:13. He
                    knows how weak he is, and so seeks protection from anything
                    that would cause him to fall. Yet in the moment of trial he
                    counts it a privilege to be able to suffer for the truth and give
                    his testimony to the One who has saved him from sin to walk
                    in the path of righteousness.

 THINK IT THROUGH      Why is it that some people seem to suffer much more than
                    others?

                        "Life is disciplinary. While in the world, the Christian will
                    meet with adverse influences. There will be provocations to
                    test the temper; and it is by meeting these in a right spirit that
                    the Christian graces are developed. If injuries and insults are
                    meekly borne, if insulting words are responded to by gentle
                    answers, and oppressive acts by kindness, this is evidence
                    that the Spirit of Christ dwells in the heart, that sap from the
                    living Vine is flowing to the branches. We are in the school of
                    Christ in this life, where we are to learn to be meek and lowly
                    of heart; and in the day of final accounts we shall see that all
                    the obstacles we meet, all the hardships and annoyances that
                    we are called to bear, are practical lessons in the application
                    of principles of Christian life."—Testimonies, Vol. 5, p. 344.

              Part 2    "Beloved, being very eager to write to you of our common
                     salvation, I found it necessary to write appealing to you to
        CONTENDING conterid   for the faith which was once for all delivered to the
      FOR THE FAITH saints."
         Jude 3, RSV
                        Even under adversity the Christian is to contend for his faith.
                     There is no suggestion that in difficult circumstances the Chris-
                     tian might find it expedient to hide his identity. His witness to
                     the faith is more important than life itself.
                         What is the result of either proclaiming or hiding one's faith
                     in Jesus? Matt. 10:32, 33.

                        We value our lives very highly, and it is natural to try to save
                     our lives at any cost. Satan knows this and therefore attacks
                     us at this point. But we must differentiate between this tem-
                     poral life and eternal life. The real tragedy is not to die now,
                     but to die eternally.
                        Whom did Jesus say we should fear? Matt. 10:28.

                         "What was the strength of those who in the past have suf-
                      fered persecution for Christ's sake? It was union with God,
                      union with the Holy Spirit, union with Christ. Reproach and
                     persecution have separated many from earthly friends, but
                     never from the love of Christ.... When for the truth's sake the
                      believer stands at the bar of earthly tribunals, Christ stands
                     by his side. When he is confined within prison walls, Christ
                     manifests Himself to him and cheers his heart with His love.
                     When he suffers death for Christ's sake, the Saviour says to
                     him, They may kill the body, but they cannot hurt the soul."
                     —The Acts of the Apostles, page 85.
                         The martyrdom of the Christian is not the end of his life or
                     influence. It has rightly been said that the blood of the martyrs
                     is the seed of the church.
 THINK IT THROUGH       What are ways in which a Christian may deny his Lord?

                         "He who would confess Christ must have Christ abiding in
                     him. He cannot communicate that which he has not received.
                     The disciples might speak fluently on doctrines, they might
                     repeat the words of Christ Himself; but unless they possessed
                     Christlike meekness and love, they were not confessing Him.
                     A spirit contrary to the spirit of Christ would deny Him, what-
                     ever the profession. Men may deny Christ by evilspeaking, by
                     foolish talking, by words that are untruthful or unkind. They
                     may deny Him by shunning life's burdens, by the pursuit of
                     sinful pleasure. They may deny Him by conforming to the world,
                     by uncourteous behavior, by the love of their own opinions, by
                     justifying self, by cherishing doubt, borrowing trouble, and
                     dwelling in darkness. In all these ways they declare that Christ
                     is not in them."—The Desire of Ages, page 357.

Jesus' People Under Attack         LESSON 9                              ❑ Tuesday
                                                                          August 28

             Part 3     "I lift up my eyes to the hills.
                            From whence does my help come?
       LOOKING TO
    GOD FOR HELP        My help comes from the Lord,
  Ps. 121:1, 2, RSV       who made heaven and earth."
                         Mountains have always been a symbol of strength and
                      stability. People who have fled to the mountains have often
                      found protection and safety. In ancient Israel the hills were
                      sites of idolatry. But there is One who is stronger than all the
                      mountains put together; He is the One who has placed them
                      there and can remove them at His will. The psalmist recog-
                      nized, as do all those in similar circumstances, that true help
                      comes only from the Lord.
                         What did Jesus say was stronger than mountains? Matt.
                      17:20.
                          "Throughout the history of God's people great mountains
                      of difficulty, apparently insurmountable, have loomed up before
                      those who were trying to carry out the purposes of Heaven.
                      Such obstacles are permitted by the Lord as a test of faith.
                      When we are hedged about on every side, this is the time above
                      all others to trust in God and in the power of His Spirit. The
                      exercise of a living faith means an increase of spiritual strength
                      and the development of an unfaltering trust. It is thus that the
                      soul becomes a conquering power."—Prophets and Kings,
                      pages 594, 595.
                        What illustration does Isaiah use to contrast the mountains
                      and the power of God? Isa. 40:12.
                         When we look at the vastness of the sea or the solidness
                      of the mountains, we need to remember the One who created
                      them and remember that He is on our side. There is nothing
                      He cannot do for us. Though we may be helpless and weak, He
                      can supply all our lack.
                          Jesus went to a mountain to pray. Moses received the Ten
                      Commandments in a mountain. The wicked will call upon the
                      mountains to fall on them. In prophecy, mountains symbolize
                      powers. Thus mountains are more than objects of beauty; they
                      point us to God and remind us of lessons of Scripture.
  THINK IT THROUGH      What other truths do mountains call to mind besides the
                      ones mentioned in this part of the lesson?
                         "Behind the lofty bulwarks of the mountains—in all ages
                      the refuge of the persecuted and oppressed—the Waldenses
                      found a hiding place. Here the light of truth was kept burning
                      amid the darkness of the Middle Ages. Here, for a thousand
                      years, witnesses for the truth maintained the ancient faith. . . .
                      To those faithful exiles the mountains were an emblem of the
                      immutable righteousness of Jehovah."—The Great Controversy,

              Part 4     "Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus
         ENDURING Christ."
         HARDNESS        The Christian life is compared to warfare, and the Christian
          2 Tim. 2:3 is told that he must put on armor and go out to fight. Eph.
                     6:11-17; 1 Tim. 6:12.
                       What is the nature of the fight in which the Christian is en-
                     gaged? Eph. 6:12.

                         The Christian is not out to destroy life, but to preserve it.
                     His conflict is with the forces of evil, and that is why the strug-
                     gle is constant and taxing. There is no letup in the controversy.
                     "Till the close of time there will be a conflict between the
                     church of God and those who are under the control of evil
                     angels."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 219. The tempter is
                     subtle, and only too often he succeeds in causing the unwary
                     to fall.
                       In view of the danger the Christian confronts, what did Jesus
                     say were two characteristics he should have? Matt. 10:16.

                        Wisdom will prevent us from doing things that may be per-
                     fectly right but are not expedient at the moment. The Christian's
                     objective is always to save, and therefore he will modify his
                     action in order not to create prejudice, or cause someone to
                     stumble. Not all things that are lawful are always expedient.
                     1 Cor. 6:12.
                        Harmlessness is another characteristic of the Christian.
                     Sometimes he feels righteous indignation rising in his blood,
                     and he would like to call down fire and brimstone on the enemy.
                     But this is not the spirit of Christ. The Christian warfare is
                     against sin, not sinners; against the author of sin, and not those
                     who have been deceived by him. Sometimes the Christian has
                     quite a struggle with himself!
 THINK IT THROUGH       Why is it that Satan seems to succeed in deceiving many?

                        "The tempter often works most successfully through those
                     who are least suspected of being under his control. The pos-
                     sessors of talent and education are admired and honored. . . .
                     The opinion prevails with many that all which appears like
                     courtesy or refinement must, in some sense, pertain to Christ.
                     Never was there a greater mistake. These qualities should
                     grace the character of every Christian, for they would exert
                     a powerful influence in favor of true religion; but they must
                     be consecrated to God, or they also are a power for evil. Many
                     a man of cultured intellect and pleasant manners, who would
                     not stoop to what is commonly regarded as an immoral act, is
                     but a polished instrument in the hands of Satan."—The Great

             Part 5     "And except those days should be shortened, there should
                      no flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be
 A TIME CUT SHORT     shortened."
        Matt. 24:22
                          God, in His mercy, knows how much the frail human nature
                      can endure, and He acts accordingly. Paul writes to the Co-
                      rinthians: "No temptation has overtaken you that is not com-
                      mon to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted
                      beyond your strength, but with the temptation will also provide
                      the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it." 1 Cor.
                      10:13, RSV.
                          John foresaw the church, pictured as a woman, flee into
                      the wilderness for a period of "a thousand two hundred and
                      threescore days." Rev. 12:6. This period of time is mentioned
                      seven times in the books of Daniel and the Revelation, and
                      applies to the period of papal supremacy from A.D. 538 to A.D.
                      1798. See SDA Bible Commentary, on Rev. 12:6. During this
                      time the church was to be "nourished" (Rev. 12:14), which in-
                      dicates that God looks after His own even though they may
                      be driven into exile or suffer persecution. God permits His
                      people to be tried, but He will not permit all His people to be
                       destroyed or the light of truth to be extinguished. The annals
                      of history reveal how a dominant church linked up civil and
                       religious power in the Middle Ages and rose to authority never
                       witnessed before. Daniel had seen the rise of this power and
                       described it in Dan. 7:8, 21, 24, 25. It was a power that would
                       make outstanding claims for itself and would persecute the
                       saints and almost destroy them.

                          What characteristics of this dominant church indicate that
                      its teaching and practice are not in harmony with the Word of
                      God? Dan. 7:25.

                        The period of domination was cut short by the Protestant
                      Reformation.

 THINK IT THROUGH        Why is it that we do not have as much information about
                      the Waldenses and other members of the church in the wilder-
                      ness as we would like?

                         "The history of God's people during the ages of darkness
                      that followed upon Rome's supremacy is written in heaven, but
                      they have little place in human records. Few traces of their
                      existence can be found, except in the accusations of their per-
                      secutors. It was the policy of Rome to obliterate every trace of
                      dissent from her doctrines or decrees. Everything heretical,
                      whether persons or writings, she sought to destroy. Expressions
                      of doubt, or questions as to the authority of papal dogmas,
                      were enough to forfeit the life of rich or poor, high or low."

              Part 6    "And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened
                     her mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast
       HELP IS SENT out of his mouth."
         Rev. 12:16
                       How did the dragon try to destroy the woman who had been
                     enabled to flee into the wilderness? Rev. 12:15.


                         Water is necessary for life, but in quantity it can be a de-
                     structive element. Water in prophecy refers to people. Rev.
                     17:15. The dragon seeks to destroy the true church by flooding
                     it with people so that the identity of the church may be lost.
                     It is not the size of the church or the number of its adherents
                     that determines the character of the church; it is the number
                     who reflect the character of Christ.
                       What agent helped the woman so that she was not carried
                     away by the flood? Rev. 12:16.


                        The SDA Bible Commentary suggests two interpretations of
                     the word "earth." See under Rev. 12:16. One has to do with
                     the North American continent which was sparsely populated at
                     the time of the Reformation; and the other refers to the Prot-
                     estant Reformation itself. The main point is not how the woman
                     was helped, but that she was helped. The dragon is angry with
                     anything that represents God and His government. He wants
                     to destroy every vestige of it, but his plans are foiled at every
                     twist and turn. Even before he begins to fight, he is a defeated
                     foe. Therefore God's people have no need to fear. Satan may
                     "wear out" saints; he may "prevail" against them; but he can
                     never destroy them, for they are in God's hands.
 THINK IT THROUGH       How does one differentiate the true church from the false?


                         "Every manifestation of God's power for His people arouses
                     the enmity of Satan. Every time God works in their behalf,
                     Satan with his angels works with renewed vigor to compass
                     their ruin. He is jealous of all who make Christ their strength.
                     His object is to instigate evil, and when he has succeeded,
                     throw all the blame upon the tempted ones. He points to their
                     filthy garments, their defective characters. He presents their
                     weakness and folly, their sins of ingratitude, their unlikeness
                     to Christ, which have dishonored their Redeemer. All this he
                     urges as an argument proving his right to work his will in their
                     destruction. He endeavors to affright their souls with the thought
                     that their case is hopeless, that the stain of their defilement
                     can never be washed away. He hopes so to destroy their faith
                     that they will yield fully to his temptations, and turn from their
                     allegiance to God."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 168.

             Part 1   "Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose
         THE IMAGE height  was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six
                    cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of
           Dan. 3:1 Babylon."
                       What was the difference between this image and the one
                     which God showed Nebuchadnezzar in a dream? Dan. 2:38-44.

                         "The words, 'Thou art this head of gold,' had made a deep
                     impression upon the ruler's mind. . . . The wise men of his
                     realm, taking advantage of this and of his return to idolatry,
                     proposed that he make an image similar to the one seen in his
                     dream, and set it up where all might behold the head of gold,
                     which had been interpreted as representing his kingdom.
                         "Pleased with the flattering suggestion, he determined to
                     carry it out, and to go even farther. Instead of reproducing the
                     image as he had seen it, he would excel the original. His image
                     should not deteriorate in value from the head to the feet, but
                     should be entirely of gold—symbolic throughout of Babylon as
                     an eternal, indestructible, all-powerful kingdom, which should
                     break in pieces all other kingdoms and stand forever."—Proph-
                     ets and Kings, page 504.
                         The image of Daniel 2 pointed to the overthrow of earthly
                     kingdoms at the coming of Jesus and their replacement by the
                     kingdom of God. Nebuchadnezzar's image was intended to
                     portray Babylon, not merely as the greatest of earthly kingdoms,
                     but as the kingdom that would replace God's kingdom, as it
                     had been shown in the dream, and which would stand forever.
                     If Babylon replaced God's kingdom in Nebuchadnezzar's plan,
                     then the king of Babylon took the place of God. Certainly
                     Nebuchadnezzar realized that he could not remain king of
                     Babylon forever, but he and his successors would rule an
                     everlasting kingdom and they would correspond to the God of
                     Daniel.
                         Nebuchadnezzar's plan to erect a golden image represent-
                     ing Babylon was not an original idea, but a perversion of re-
                     vealed truth. The idea originated with the God-given dream, but
                     "Daniel's interpretation was to be rejected and forgotten; truth
                     was to be misinterpreted and misapplied."—Prophets and
                     Kings, page 505.
 THINK IT THROUGH       How can we be certain we are not misinterpreting truth?

                         "In rejecting the truth, men reject its Author. In trampling
                     upon the law of God, they deny the authority of the Lawgiver.
                     It is as easy to make an idol of false doctrines and theories as

          Part 2     What does it appear to you that Nebuchadnezzar was trying
                  to achieve by the dedication ceremony?
     WORSHIP OF
      THE IMAGE
       Dan. 3:2-5
                        "To bow down when in prayer to God is the proper attitude
                    to occupy. This act of worship was required of the three Hebrew
                    captives in Babylon. . . . But such an act was homage to be
                    rendered to God alone—the Sovereign of the world, the Ruler
                    of the universe; and these three Hebrews refused to give such
                    honor to any idol even though composed of pure gold. In doing
                    so, they would, to all intents and purposes, be bowing to the
                    king of Babylon."—Selected Messages, Bk. 2, p. 312.
                        The apparent center of the story is the image, but it is really
                    Nebuchadnezzar himself. He had the image made and erected;
                    he called together the audience of officials; it was his herald
                    that declared the procedure for the dedication; and it is re-
                    peatedly called "the golden image which King Nebuchadnezzar
                    had set up," as though that was its name.
                        An object of worship usually has meaning, but no meaning
                    is given to the image in the story. The only meaning seen is
                    in Nebuchadnezzar's command enforced by threat of death by
                    burning. Allegiance to Nebuchadnezzar or allegiance to Baby-
                     lon was the same thing. Where all the representatives of "peo-
                    ples, nations, and languages" bowed down at the king's com-
                    mand, it appeared that he had achieved unity of power and
                    allegiance throughout the empire. Each representative could
                     now carry to his home territory the report of the total, worldwide
                    allegiance to Babylon, demonstrated at Dura, thus further
                     solidifying Nebuchadnezzar's power.
                         To worship the image was to obey Nebuchadnezzar and
                     disobey God.

 THINK IT THROUGH       In what ways are we in constant danger of giving to man
                    allegiance due to God only?


                        "This is the test that the people of God must have before
                    they are sealed. All who prove their loyalty to God by observing
                    His law, and refusing to accept a spurious sabbath, will rank
                    under the banner of the Lord God Jehovah, and will receive
                    the seal of the living God. Those who yield the truth of heavenly
                    origin and accept the Sunday sabbath, will receive the mark
                    of the beast....
                        "History will be repeated. False religion will be exalted. The
                    first day of the week, a common working day, possessing no
                    sanctity whatever, will be set up as was the image at Babylon.
                    All nations and tongues and peoples will be commanded to
                    worship this spurious sabbath. This is Satan's plan to make
                    of no account the day instituted by God, and given to the world
                    as a memorial of creation."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA

           Part 3     "And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the
 THE ENFORCEMENT same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.
                   Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of
        Dan. 3:6,1 the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of musick,
                     all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down and
                     worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king
                     had set up."
                         Nebuchadnezzar provided music for the dedication. It was
                     used as a signal, but it must have had more significance than
                     merely designating the order of the ceremony. A single trum-
                     peter could have done that. The king provided a whole orches-
                     tra. The moment was as attractive as man could make it—an
                     image made of the most beautiful metal, an orchestra provid-
                     ing enchanting music, and the elite of society composing the
                     audience. But these circumstances were not sufficient to assure
                     Nebuchadnezzar of the total success of his plan. Beyond the
                     aesthetic and social appeal of the occasion there was the
                     threat of death by burning for noncompliance.
                         The word "therefore" which begins verse 7 indicates that
                     it was fear of the consequences of refusal that brought the
                     representatives of the world to their knees on the plain of Dura.
                         This threat was the ultimate fruit of Nebuchadnezzar's choice
                     to exalt himself. It was the same attitude toward life as resulted
                     in Satan's fall.
                         "He [Lucifer] sought for himself the highest place, and every
                     being who is actuated by his spirit will do the same. Thus
                     alienation, discord, and strife will be inevitable. Dominion be-
                     comes the prize of the strongest. The kingdom of Satan is a
                     kingdom of force; every individual regards every other as an
                     obstacle in the way of his own advancement, or a steppingstone
                     on which he himself may climb to a higher place."—The Desire
                     of Ages, pages 435, 436.
 THINK IT THROUGH       What practices and attitudes in my life tend to exalt myself?
                          "The decree enforcing the worship of this day [Sunday] is to
                      go forth to all the world. In a limited degree, it has already
                      gone forth. In several places the civil power is speaking with
                     the voice of a dragon, just as the heathen king spoke to the
                     Hebrew captives.
                         "Trial and persecution will come to all who, in obedience
                      to the Word of God, refuse to worship this false sabbath. Force
                     is the last resort of every false religion. At first it tries attrac-
                     tion, as the king of Babylon tried the power of music and out- ,
                      ward show. If these attractions, invented by men inspired by
                     Satan, failed to make men worship the image, the hungry
                     flames of the furnace were ready to consume them. So it will
                     be now. The papacy has exercised her power to compel men
                     to obey her, and she will continue to do so. We need the same
                     spirit that was manifested by God's servants in the conflict with
                     paganism."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commen-

An Obedient People       LESSON 10                                ❑ Wednesday
                                                                     September 5

           Part 4     Read Dan. 3:8-12.
  THE ACCUSATION
                     What was the triple accusation brought against the three
       Dan. 3:8-12 Hebrews? Verse 12.



                        The Chaldeans' lives were saved by Daniel's revelation of
                    the king's dream, and it was this group with whom Daniel and
                    his companions were closely identified. See Dan. 2:10-12, 18.
                    There is no way to know if the same persons were now involved
                    in the accusation against the three Hebrews, although this is
                    possible; but it is clear that the three Hebrews had been asso-
                    ciated with the Chaldeans, and circumstances made it virtually
                    impossible that the Chaldeans were not at least acquainted
                    with the three Hebrews. The accusation against the three came
                    from acquaintances and associates of the three Hebrews.
                        The Babylonian officials were quick to seize the opportunity
                    to discredit the three Jews who had been given positions of
                     responsibility, authority, and financial gain.
                        The words of verse 8 mean literally, "They ate the pieces
                    of the Jews." The verb usually means "to slander, to accuse
                     falsely and maliciously." The Chaldeans were not bringing
                     some idle complaint, but a malicious attack.
 THINK IT THROUGH      What is the basic motivation behind accusations against a
                    person?



                       In connection with events of the last days, Ellen White has
                    written:
                        "Conscientious obedience to the word of God will be treated
                    as rebellion. Blinded by Satan, the parent will exercise harsh-
                    ness and severity toward the believing child; the master or
                    mistress will oppress the commandment-keeping servant. Af-
                    fection will be alienated; children will be disinherited and
                    driven from home....
                        "As the storm approaches, a large class who have professed
                    faith in the third angel's message, but have not been sanctified
                    through obedience to the truth, abandon their position and join
                    the ranks of the opposition. By uniting with the world and par-
                    taking of its spirit, they have come to view matters in nearly
                    the same light; and when the test is brought, they are prepared
                    to choose the easy, popular side. Men of talent and pleasing
                    address, who once rejoiced in the truth, employ their powers
                    to deceive and mislead souls. They become the most .bitter
                    enemies of their former brethren. When Sabbathkeepers are
                     brought before the courts to answer for their faith, these apos-
                     tates are the most efficient agents of Satan to misrepresent
                     and accuse them, and by false reports and insinuations to stir
                     up the rulers against them."—The Great Controversy, page 608.

             Part 5      Read Dan. 3:13-18.
TRIAL AND DEFENSE
                          Seen from the viewpoint of his own principles, Nebuchad-
       Dan. 3:13.18   nezzar was quite magnanimous to offer a second chance to the
                      three Hebrews, but seen from the viewpoint of God's character
                      the only truly loving act Nebuchadnezzar could have performed
                      under the circumstances would be to permit the three Hebrews
                      to follow their consciences. The second chance was under the
                      same threat of death as the first.
                           "Careful. The response of the defendants may be trans-
                      lated, 'We have no need to answer you in this matter' (RSV).
                      Some have interpreted this reply as highly arrogant, and have
                      pointed to martyrs reacting similarly toward their persecutors.
                      . . . Analogies from cognate and other languages show that
                      the sense is to 'make defense,' or 'apology.' Since the defend-
                      ants did not deny the truth of the indictment, they saw no need
                      to make a defense. Their case rested in the hands of their God
                      (see v. 17), and they made their answer in complete submission
                      to His will, whatever might be the outcome of their trial. That
                      they were not sure of coming through this experience alive can
                      be seen from their further statement (v. 18). Had they been sure
                      of deliverance, their reply could be interpreted as revealing
                      spiritual arrogance. As the case stood, their attitude showed
                      their firm conviction that their course of action was the only
                      feasible one, which needed no defense, or even further ex-
                      planation."—SDA Bible Commentary, on Dan. 3:16.

 THINK IT THROUGH        What is the deciding factor in whether I should take a firm
                      stand in a situation, even risking life itself, or whether I should
                      be moderate and yielding? See "Testimonies to Ministers,"
                      pages 252, 253.




                          "The light is to be brought before kings and before the great
                      men of the earth, although they may receive it in the same
                      manner in which. Pharaoh received the testimony of the ser-
                      vants of the Lord, and asked, 'Who is the Lord, that I should
                      obey His voice?'
                         "Kings, governors, and great men will hear of you through
                      the reports of those who are at enmity with you, and your faith
                      and character will be misrepresented before them. But those
                      who are falsely accused will have an opportunity to appear in
                      the presence of their accusers to answer for themselves. They
                      will have the privilege of bringing the light before those who
                      are called the great men of the earth, and if you have studied
                      the Bible, if you are ready to give an answer to every man that

            Part 6    Read Dan. 3:19-30.
DELIVERENCE FROM
                      The three Hebrews decided it was better to die than to dis-
       EXECUTION obey God. To have decided it was better to live than to defy
      Dan. 3:19-30 the king would have made impossible the glorification of God
                    that took place before the assembled officials, many of whom
                    had come from distant points. The story they now could recount
                    to the citizens of their home territories was the story of deliver-
                    ance from the fire by the God of the Jews.
                        Notice the results of the miraculous deliverance: (1) Nebu-
                    chadnezzar's plans to institute a new recurring ceremony were
                    foiled; (2) the rule of Nebuchadnezzar was demonstrated to be
                    less than absolute; (3) the God of the Hebrews was shown to
                    be superior to the gods of Nebuchadnezzar; and (4) God was
                    shown to be on the side of conscience and free choice and
                    against compulsion.

 THINK IT THROUGH     What should be the believer's attitude when God does not
                    choose to deliver him?


                        "The dignitaries of church and state will unite to bribe, per-
                    suade, or compel all classes to honor the Sunday. The lack of
                    divine authority will be supplied by oppressive enactments.
                    Political corruption is destroying love of justice and regard for
                    truth; and even in free America, rulers and legislators, in order
                    to secure public favor, will yield to the popular demand for a
                    law enforcing Sunday observance. Liberty of conscience, which
                    has cost so great a sacrifice, will no longer be respected. In
                    the soon-coming conflict we shall see exemplified the prophet's
                    words: 'The dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to
                    make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the com-
                    mandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.'
                    Revelation 12:17."—The Great Controversy, page 592.
                         "Important are the lessons to be learned from the experience
                     of the Hebrew youth on the plain of Dura. In this our day, many
                     of God's servants, though innocent of wrongdoing, will be given
                     over to suffer humiliation and abuse at the hands of those who,
                     inspired by Satan, are filled with envy and religious bigotry.
                     Especially will the wrath of man be aroused against those who
                     hallow the Sabbath of the fourth commandment; and at last a
                     universal decree will denounce these as deserving of death.
                         "The season of distress before God's people will call for a
                     faith that will not falter. His children must make it manifest that
                     He is the only object of their worship, and that no considera-
                     tion, not even that of life itself, can induce them to make the
                     least concession to false worship. To the loyal heart the com-
                     mands of sinful, finite men will sink into- insignificance beside
                     the word of the eternal God. Truth will be obeyed though the

The Witness of Jesus' People—I        LESSON 11                       ❑ Sunday
                                                                     September 9

           Part 1    The first angel's message (Rev. 14:6, 7) begins abruptly
                  after a passage dealing with the Lamb and 144,000 followers.
     TIME OF THE Since   the context of these verses places their fulfillment after
       MESSAGES the second coming of Jesus, the question arises as to when
                    the three angels' messages reach their fulfillment. To relate
                    these messages to their correct period is the purpose of today's
                    lesson.
                        Revelation 13 begins with a prophecy of the leopardlike
                    beast and the narration of his work closes in verse 10 with the
                    words "Here is the patience and the faith of the saints." With
                    verse 11 there begins a prophecy of the lamblike beast, and the
                    narration of the prophecy that pertains to him closes with Rev.
                    14:12 where again are found the words "Here is the patience
                    of the saints." Thus the three angels' messages are in the
                    prophetic sequence dealing with the lamblike beast.
                        A closer look at Rev. 13:11-14:12 shows that verses 11-18
                     are about the beast—his work, followers, and mark. The next
                     passage, Rev. 14:1-5, is about the Lamb—His followers and
                     mark.
                        The prophecy of the beast deals only with the beast, and
                     the action opposing him does not enter at any point in Rev.
                     13:11-18. The recital of the Lamb's redemption of His followers
                     makes no mention of the beast. To complete the picture, there
                     should be seen God's action during the time of the lamblike
                     beast. This is the subject of Rev. 14:6-12, often referred to as
                     the three angels' messages. When are these messages to be
                     proclaimed? During the time of the lamblike beast.
                        The lamblike beast is pictured in prophecy as continuing
                     up to the second advent, and his origin is noted after the rule
                     of the leopardlike beast, which ended with the close of the 1260
                     years, or in 1798. So the lamblike beast, and thus the three
                     angels' messages, fit into the period from 1798 to the second
                     advent. Ellen G. White, in explaining the point of beginning for
                     the first angel's message wrote: "But since 1798 the book of
                     Daniel has been unsealed, knowledge of the prophecies has
                     increased, and many have proclaimed the solemn message
                     of the judgment near."—The Great Controversy, page 356.
 THINK IT THROUGH      In what ways are the three angels' messages of importance
                    to me?
                       "The proclamation of the first, second, and third angels'
                    messages has been located by the Word of Inspiration. Not
                    a peg or pin is to be removed. No human authority has any
                    more right to change the location of these messages than to
                    substitute the New Testament for the Old. . . .
                       "The first and second messages were given in 1843 and
                    1844, and we are now under the proclamation of the third; but
                    all three of the messages are still to be proclaimed. . . .
                    These messages we are to give to the world in publications, in

        THE ANGELS ple."
           Rev. 14:6
                        What is the gospel or "good news" carried by the angel?
                     Some see in this passage a good news different from the gospel
                     of Jesus Christ. This, they say, is indicated by the fact that no
                     definite article appears with "gospel" in the Greek. It is rea-
                     sonable to assume that when the angel speaks he is declaring
                     the good news that has been entrusted to him. He shouts a
                     threefold command to fear, glorify, and worship God. The fear
                     and the glory because the judgment has arrived; the worship
                     because God is Creator. Is this the gospel of Jesus Christ?
                        In the preaching of Jesus "the thought of judgment is cen-
                     tral. Jesus' call to repentance is urgent because God's judg-
                     ment hangs over every man. The task of Jesus is continually
                     to impress on men the seriousness of this judgment and to
                     awaken fear of the Judge."—Theological Dictionary of the New
                     Testament, Vol. 3, p. 936.
                        Paul proclaimed to the people of Lystra that he brought to
                     them "good news, that you should turn from these vain things
                     to a living God who made the heaven and the earth and the
                     sea and all that is in them." Acts 14:15, RSV. This turning to
                     God the Judge and God the Creator is a basic element of the
                     gospel of Jesus Christ.
                        The good news of the angel is described as eternal or ever-
                     lasting because it is good news of the eternal God, and the
                     proclaiming of this good news of the Eternal is precisely the
                     purpose of the life and work of Jesus Christ. It is proclaimed
                     worldwide because all earth dwellers will be judged.

                     to Christ in wholehearted devotion, angels rejoice that they

                                                                          September 11

              Part 3       "Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him;
                        for the hour of his judgment is come."
    THE JUDGMENT
Rev. 14:1, first part
                            The reason for the angel's proclamation of good news is the
                        arrival of the time of judgment. Judgment is not good news to
                        one who expects condemnation. The good news is that by
                        giving fear and glory to God one can be acquitted in the judg-
                        ment. The good news is that there is a way out.
                             If the call to fear and glorify God is still a possibility when
                        the angel proclaims it, then the judgment of God of which he
                        speaks cannot be an event that is immediately fully accom-
                        plished; and yet the passage states that "the hour of his judg-
                        ment is come." In some way the judgment and the possibility
                        of turning to God must be simultaneous for a time. There is
                        judgment, and there is opportunity to repent; but it is the last
                        time, and therefore the message is urgent. When do these
                        circumstances exist?
                             "The announcement, 'The hour of His judgment is come,'
                        points to the closing work of Christ's ministration for the sal-
                        vation of men. It heralds a truth which must be proclaimed
                        until the Saviour's intercession shall cease and He shall return
                        to the earth to take His people to Himself. The work of judgment
                        which began in 1844 must continue until the cases of all are
                         decided, both of the living and the dead; hence it will extend
                         to the close of human probation. That men may be prepared to
                         stand in the judgment, the message commands them to 'fear
                         God, and give glory to Him,' and worship Him that made
                         heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of water.' "
                        —The Great Controversy, pages 435, 436.
                              Refraining from sin in the light of the judgment is to be
                         accompanied by giving glory to God. "To give glory to God is
                         to reveal His character in our own, and thus make Him known.
                         And in whatever way we make known the Father or the Son, we
                         glorify God."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commen-
                         tary, Vol. 7, p. 979. Thus, giving glory to God is the other side
                         of the coin from fear. It is the combination of giving up sin and
                         living Godlike lives that prepares men for the judgment. This
                          is the work of the gospel of Jesus Christ. To fear and to glorify
                         God is to be righteous by faith.

  THINK IT THROUGH          What is my personal standing in relation to the judgment?


                            "We are rapidly approaching the end of this earth's history;
                         and as we realize that Jesus is indeed coming soon, we shall
                         be aroused to labor as never before. We are bidden to sound
                         an alarm to the people. And in our own lives we are to show
                         forth the power of truth and righteousness. The world is soon
                         to meet the great Lawgiver over His broken law. Those only
                         who turn from transgression to obedience can hope for pardon

              Part 4       What identification is given of the God that men are called
                        to worship?
      THE CREATOR
 Rev. 14:7, last part      "Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to
                        him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him
                        that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains
                        of waters."

                            Mention of the judgment of the Creator sets forth the end
                        and the beginning of the world. Men today live between these
                        two divine events, which provides a basis for them to know
                        how to relate to life. They are held accountable by God because
                        they have been made by God; and because God has made
                        them and will judge them, they are commanded to worship
                        Him.
                            The command to worship the Creator is especially pertinent
                        in the light of the coercive efforts, prophesied to take place
                        under the lamblike beast-power, to bring men to worship the
                        image of the beast. Thus in the time of this beast-power people
                        will be faced with a command to worship the Creator and also
                        a demand, under threat of death, enforcing the idolatrous wor-
                        ship of the beast's image. Since the warning against this form

                        the call to the true worship of God, as given in the first mes-
                        sage, precedes persecution for non-worship of the beast's
                        image.
                            "In Revelation 14, men are called upon to worship the Crea-
                        tor; and the prophecy brings to view a class that, as the result
                        of the threefold message, are keeping the commandments of
                        God. One of these commandments points directly to God as
                        the Creator. The fourth precept declares: 'The seventh day is
                        the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: . . . for in six days the Lord
                        made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and
                        rested the seventh day.' "—The Great Controversy, page 437.

                        Creator? How should I relate to each of these positions of my
                        heavenly Father?
                           "Since the Reformation, there have been some in every gen-
                        eration to maintain its [Sabbath] observance. Though often in
                        the midst of reproach and persecution, a constant testimony
                        has been borne to the perpetuity of the law of God and the
                        sacred obligation of the creation Sabbath.
                           "These truths, as presented in Revelation 14 in connection
                        with 'the everlasting gospel,' will distinguish the church of
                        Christ at the time of His appearing. For as the result of the
                        threefold message it is announced: 'Here are they that keep
                        the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.' And this

The Witness of Jesus' People—I          LESSON 11                       ❑ Thursday
                                                                        September 13

          Part 5         "And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen,
                     is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of
        BABYLON      the wine of the wrath of her fornication."
        Rev. 14:8
                          The name Babel, from which Babylon developed, first ap-
                     pears as the name of a city and proposed tower, built to hold
                     men together and make a name for themselves. The city was
                     founded by Nimrod. Centuries later, when Babylon was, as an
                     empire, ruled by Nebuchadnezzar, the nation of Judah was
                     three times invaded, and the populace taken captive. Thus,
                     historically Babylon was in opposition to God and His people;
                     and when Rome came into opposition against both Christians
                     and Jews, the name Babylon became a derogatory nickname
                     for Rome. In the book of Revelation the meaning is expanded
                     and is used as a symbol "of all apostate religious organizations
                     and their leadership, from antiquity down to the close of time."
                     —SDA Bible Commentary, on Rev. 14:8.
                           "In Babylonian the name Bab-ilu (Babel, or Babylon) meant
                     'gate of the gods,' but the Hebrews derogatorily associated it
                      with balal, a word in their language meaning 'to confuse' (see
                      on Gen. 11:9). The rulers of Babylon doubtless called their city
                      the 'gate' of the gods in the sense that they chose to think of
                      it as the place where the gods consorted with men, to order
                      the affairs of earth (see on Judges 9:35; Ruth 4:1; 1 Kings
                      22:10; Jer. 22:3). The name thus seems to have reflected the
                      claim of the Babylonian kings that they had been commissioned
                      to rule the world by divine mandate."—SDA Bible Commentary,
                      on Rev. 14:8.
                           But why should the figure of Babylon be introduced here
                      in a prophecy that pertains to the lamblike beast? The beast
                      is part of a larger whole, as is indicated by the fact that he
                      orders others to make an image to the leopardlike beast. But
                      he has not only accomplices but also predecessors, since it
                       is from the leopard beast that he is said to get his power. This
                       larger whole, accomplices and predecessors, is called Baby-
                       lon; but the power center of Babylon's last-day manifestation
                       is the lamblike beast.
                            "It is, however, possible that this meaning [gate of the gods]
                       was secondary, and that the name was originally from the
                       Babylonian verb babalu, meaning 'to scatter,' or 'to disappear.'
                       Perhaps the Babylonians were not particularly proud of a name
                        that reminded them of the inglorious climax of earlier plans for
                       the city, and so invented an explanation that made it appear
                        to be a compound of the names bab, `port,' and ilu, `god.' "
                       —SDA Bible Commentary, on Gen. 11:9.
                            Thus the symbolic name Babylon combines the connotations
                        of a religious power, a confusion of humanity, and an unstable,
                        non-permanent situation.

                       is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink
     BABYLON'S FALL    of the wine of the wrath of her fornication."
           Rev. 14:8
                          The text states that Babylon is fallen, which raises the ques-
                       tion if this prophecy is not still wholly for the future. While it
                       cannot be said that this prophecy is fulfilled until Babylon is
                       fully fallen, nevertheless the first evidences of fall are pertinent
                       to the complete fall.
                           "The second angel's message of Revelation 14 was first
                       preached in the summer of 1844, and it then had a more direct
                       application to the churches of the United States, where 'the
                       warning of the judgment had been most widely proclaimed and
                       most generally rejected, and where the declension in the
                       churches had been most rapid. But the message of the second
                       angel did not reach its complete fulfillment in 1844. The
                       churches then experienced a moral fall, in consequence of
                       their refusal of the light of the advent message; but that fall
                       was not complete. As they have continued to reject the special
                       truths for this time they have fallen lower and lower. Not yet,
                       however, can it be said that 'Babylon is fallen, . . . because
                       she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her
                       fornication.' She has not yet made all nations do this. The
                       spirit of world conforming and indifference to the testing truths
                       for our time exists and has been gaining ground in churches
                       of the Protestant faith in all the countries of Christendom; and
                       these churches are included in the solemn and terrible denun-
                       ciation of the second angel. But the work of apostasy has not
                       yet reached its culmination.
                           "The Bible declares that before the coming of the Lord,
                       Satan will work 'with all power and signs and lying wonders,
                       and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness;' and they that
                       'received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved,'
                       will be left to receive 'strong delusion, that they should believe
                       a lie.' 2 Thessalonians 2:9-11. Not until this condition shall be
                       reached, and the union of the church with the world shall be
                       fully accomplished throughout Christendom, ,will the fall of
                       Babylon be complete. The change is a progressive one, and
                       the perfect fulfillment of Revelation 14:8 is yet future."—The

          THE WINE Ion and the nations?
          Rev. 14:8
                        "And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen,
                     is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of
                     the wine of the wrath of her fornication."



                         Babylon is pictured here as causing nations to drink wine.
                     When Jeremiah in Jer. 51:7, 8 wrote of the fall of Babylon, he
                     referred to the nations as being "mad" (RSV) because they
                     drank of Babylon's wine. The action of ancient Babylon was mil-
                     itary conquest. To drink of her wine was to experience conquest
                     by Babylon's armies. But mystic Babylon's action is stated to be
                     fornication, not conquest by armies. To drink the wine of her
                     "passionate unchastity" then is to experience conquest by a
                     harlot instead of an army. But what is the meaning of the for-
                     nication to which the nations have submitted? In the Old Tes-
                     tament Israel is represented as guilty of harlotry because she
                     forsook the true God and worshiped false gods, and also be-
                     cause she entered into alliance with the great nations of earth
                     instead of trusting God to protect her. Thus symbolically har-
                     lotry has represented, in the Bible, both idolatry and worldly
                     alliances. The context of Rev. 14:8 points to both meanings
                     combined. That it involves idolatry is indicated by the image
                     of the beast; that it is alliances is pointed to by "all nations"
                     participating with her in fornication.
                         "The third angel's message has been sent forth to the world,
                     warning men against receiving the mark of the beast or of his
                     image in their foreheads or in their, hands. To receive this mark
                     means to come to the same decision as the beast has done,
                     and to advocate the same ideas, in direct opposition to the
                     Word of God."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Com-

                         "The great sin charged against Babylon is that she 'made
                     all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.'
                     This cup of intoxication which she presents to the world repre-

                     of her unlawful connection with the great ones of the earth.
                     Friendship with the world corrupts her faith, and in her turn
                     she exerts a corrupting influence upon the world by teaching
                     doctrines which are opposed to the plainest statements of

                    rule for 1260 years and then be wounded and later healed. What
                    is the image of the beast? A replica of the beast-power so
                    lifelike that it speaks. Rev. 13:15.
                        "In chapter 13 (verses 1-10) is described another beast,
                    'like unto a leopard,' to which the dragon gave 'his power, and
                    his seat, and great authority.' This symbol, as most Protestants
                    have believed, represents the papacy, which succeeded to the
                    power and seat and authority once held by the ancient Roman
                    Empire."—The Great Controversy, page 439.
                        "When the leading churches of the United States, uniting
                    upon such points of doctrine as are held by them in common,
                    shall influence the state to enforce their decrees and to sus-
                    tain their institutions, then Protestant America will have formed
                    an image of the Roman hierarchy, and the infliction of civil
                    penalties upon dissenters will inevitably result. . . .
                        "'The beast' mentioned in this message, whose worship is
                    enforced by the two-horned beast, is the first, or leopardlike
                    beast of Revelation 13—the papacy. The 'image to the beast'
                    represents that form of apostate Protestantism which will be
                    developed when the Protestant churches shall seek the aid of
                     the civil power for the enforcement of their dogmas."—The
                    Great Controversy, page 445.
                       Contrast the animal symbol used in Revelation to represent
                    Jesus, and those used to represent earthly powers. Rev. 5:6,
                    9; 14:1; 12:3; 13:2, 11. What is the significance of this con-
                    trast?


 THINK IT THROUGH     If my character were to be represented symbolically by an
                    animal, what would it be? Could my life be accurately sym-
                    bolized by a Iamb? Or is it more like a leopard?


                        "To Daniel was given a vision of fierce beasts, representing
                    the powers of the earth. But the ensign of the Messiah's king-
                    dom is a lamb. While earthly kingdoms rule by the ascendancy
                    of physical power, Christ is to banish every carnal weapon,
                    every instrument of coercion. His kingdom was to be estab-
                    lished to uplift and ennoble fallen humanity."—Ellen G. White

             Part 3        The warning here is against worship of the beast and his
       THE WORSHIP     image. This is in contrast to the call to worship God in the
                       first angel's message. The Greek word translated worship in
           Rev. 14:9   this verse designates the act of prostrating oneself before, or
                       reverencing, another who is regarded as belonging to the realm
                       of the supernatural. The beast and his image will acquire a
                       reputation as supernatural powers because of the miracles
                       that lead to the image's development. The beast and his image
                       will be designated as worthy of worship by the miracle-working
                       lamblike beast. Rev. 13:12-15. The worship that men are warned
                       against is a worship substantiated by miracles and enforced
                       under penalty of death for noncompliance.
                          In the first angel's message, what is the substantiation given
                       for worship of the true God? Rev. 14:7.

                         What is the means by which people can know whom to
                       worship? John 4:24; 17:17.

                          On what basis did Jesus refuse to worship Satan? Matt.
                       4:9, 10.

                           "Satan is busily laying his plans for the last mighty conflict,
                       when all will take sides. After the gospel has been proclaimed
                       in the world for nearly two thousand years, Satan still presents
                       to men and women the same scene that he presented to Christ.
                       In a wonderful manner he causes the kingdoms of the world
                       in their glory to pass before them. These he promises to all
                       who will fall down and worship him. Thus he seeks to bring
                       men under his dominion.
                           "Satan is working to the utmost to make himself as God
                       and to destroy all who oppose his power. And today the world
                       is bowing before him. His power is received as the power of
                       God....
                           "In his visions of things to come the prophet John beheld
                       this scene. This demon worship was revealed to him, and it
                       seemed to him as if the whole world were standing on the
                       brink of perdition. But as he looked with intense interest he
                       beheld the company of God's commandment-keeping people."

 THINK IT THROUGH        What does a miracle mean? Have I based my worship
                       wholly on the Word?

                          "It is the first and highest duty of every rational being to
                       learn from the Scriptures what is truth, and then to walk in
                       the light and encourage others to follow his example. We
                       should day by day study the Bible diligently, weighing every
                       thought and comparing scripture with scripture. With divine

The Witness of Jesus' People—II        LESSON 12                   ❑ Wednesday
                                                                    September 19

          Part 4      "And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice,
                  If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his
       THE MARK mark in his forehead, or in his hand."
        Rev. 14:9
                       The worship of the beast and reception of his mark are
                    mentioned together. The precise relationship between worship
                    and mark is not stated. It can be inferred that they are related,
                    because they are mentioned together; and that worship and
                    mark are mutual characteristics, because they are connected
                    by and, not or. Man gives worship, but he receives the mark.
                    The penalty for nonworship is death; for having no mark,
                    economic boycott. In the eight references in which the mark
                    is mentioned it is always in association with worship. It never
                    stands alone. It is also clear that worship is regarded as more
                    significant than the mark because nonworship carries the
                    death penalty, but lack of the mark carries economic boycott.
                        This would indicate that the object sought is the worship
                    of the beast, and the mark would then be the means to accom-
                    plish beast-worship and the evidence of such worship. Rev.
                    13:16 indicates that it is the evidence factor that is of primary
                    importance. This is so in the very nature of law enforcement.
                        Worship is very personal and subjective. The being wor-
                    shiped privately and revered in one's inmost soul may be
                    known to no other person. The situation described here is
                    where worship becomes a public matter that can be deter-
                    mined objectively and enforced by law. This can be accom-
                     plished only by prescribing a public manner of worship. It
                    would have to relate to a particular kind of action, or worship
                    in a prescribed location, or worship at a specified time. The
                     prophecy does not say whether the mark is action, place, or
                     time.
                        The Biblical prescription for worship is by time in memory
                     of Creation, which is pointed to in Rev. 14:7.
                        "When the test comes, it will be clearly shown what the
                     mark of the beast is. It is the keeping of Sunday. Those who,
                     after having heard the truth, continue to regard this day as
                     holy bear the signature of the man of sin, who thought to
                     change times and laws."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA
                     Bible Commentary, Vol. 7, p. 980.
 THINK IT THROUGH     How can I be assured of sufficient courage to face the
                    majority, the law, boycott, and death in the time of test?

                        "They are hedged in with difficulties. Satan assails them
                    with fierce temptations. The work which they have undertaken
                    seems far beyond their ability to accomplish. They are threat-
                    ened with destruction. The enthusiasm which animated them
                    is gone; yet they cannot turn back. Then, feeling their utter
                    helplessness, they flee to the Mighty One for strength. They
                    remember that the words which they have spoken were not
                    theirs, but His who bade them give the warning. God put the
                    truth into their hearts, and they could not forbear to proclaim
                    it."—The Great Controversy, page 609.

            Part 5      "The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God,
THE WRATH OF GOD     which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indig-
                     nation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in
    Rev. 14:10, 11   the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the
                     Lamb: and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever
                     and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the
                     beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his
                     name."

                        Those who drink of Babylon's wine (Rev. 14:8) will drink also
                     of the "wine of God's wrath." Verse 10. In Psalm 75:7, 8 wine
                     symbolizes God's judgment. Wrath and judgment belong to-
                     gether. Men have rejected God, and God cannot maintain His
                     relationship with them without their consent.
                         "This message embraces the two preceding messages. It is
                     represented as being given with a loud voice; that is, with the
                     power of the Holy Spirit. Everything is now at stake. The third
                     angel's message is to be regarded as of the highest impor-
                     tance. It is a life and death question. The impression made by
                     this message will be proportionate to the earnestness and
                     solemnity with which it is proclaimed."—Ellen G. White Com-

                        For what did Jesus pray in Gethsemane? Matt. 26:39.

                        "He knew that His hour was come; He Himself was the true
                     paschal lamb, and on the day the Passover was eaten He was
                     to be sacrificed. He was about to drink the cup of wrath; He
                     must soon receive the final baptism of suffering."—The Desire
                     of Ages, page 642.
                        Jesus experienced God's wrath, and no other human being
                     need suffer this experience, for Jesus made escape from God's
                     wrath possible. "At first the angels could not rejoice; for their
                     Commander concealed nothing from them, but opened before
                     them the plan of salvation. Jesus told them that He would
                     stand between the wrath of His Father and guilty man, that He
                     would bear iniquity and scorn, and but few would receive Him
                     as the Son of God."—Early Writings, pages 149, 150.
                        The mention of God's wrath in the Bible is really the nega-
                     tive approach to righteousness by faith, just as the verbally
                     negative command against killing really expresses a principle
                     that is positive—help the fellowman live.
 THINK IT THROUGH      Am I prepared to receive God's mercy—or God's wrath?

                        "Upon Christ as our substitute and surety was laid the ini-
                     quity of us all. He was counted a transgressor, that He might
                     redeem us from the condemnation of the law. The guilt of
                     every descendant of Adam was pressing upon His heart. The
                     wrath of God against sin, the terrible manifestation of His dis-
                     pleasure because of iniquity, filled the soul of His Son with

            Part 6    "Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep
                   the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus."
       THE SAINTS
        Rev. 14:12    The Greek word translated "patience" in the KJV has a
                     fuller meaning than the English word "patience." Its meaning
                     is a combination of waiting and endurance.
                         "[It] 'is an endurance which is grounded in waiting, a wait-
                     ing which expresses itself in endurance.' Waiting for Jesus . . .
                     is on the one side the attitude which fills the whole soul of
                     believers. On the other side salvation depends on their stead-
                     fastness to the end. . . . The final clash between the power of
                     the world and the community will also be the final and supreme
                     test of faith. It will demand of believers supreme steadfastness
                     if everything is not finally to be in vain."—Theological Diction-
                     ary of the New Testament, Vol. 4, p. 588.
                        In what way are the characteristics of the saints (command-
                     ment keeping and faith of Jesus) related to the context of the
                     three messages? Rev. 14:6-12.
                         "The result of an acceptance of these messages is given in
                     the word: 'Here are they that keep the commandments of God,
                     and the faith of Jesus.' In order to be prepared for the judg-
                     ment, it is necessary that men should keep the law of God.
                     That law will be the standard of character in the judgment."
                     —The Great Controversy, page 436.
                         "In the issue of the contest all Christendom will be divided
                     into two great classes—those who keep the commandments
                     of God and the faith of Jesus, and those who worship the beast
                     and his image and receive his mark. Although church and state
                      will unite their power to compel 'all, both small and great, rich

                   works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou
    GOD'S PEOPLE King of saints."
         Rev. 15:3
                       This song is one of eXultation, sung by the righteous and
                    occasioned by judgments which have overwhelmed the wicked.
                    The song is one not only of thanksgiving to the Lord, but one
                    which magnifies Him for the vindication of His name. The sad
                    fact is that in that day families will be divided—one member
                    will be on the inside, another on the outside. Some whom they
                    loved will have earned a heritage of shame and despair. And
                    the ransomed of the Lord will recognize how the divine attri-
                    butes have been magnified in the punishment awarded the im-
                    penitent.
                       What is the great reward for those who have been obedient
                    to God through faith in Jesus? Rev. 22:14.

                       "Then they that have kept God's commandments shall
                    breathe in immortal vigor beneath the tree of life; and through
                    unending ages the inhabitants of sinless worlds shall behold, in
                    that garden of delight, a sample of the perfect work of God's
                    creation, untouched by the curse of sin—a sample of what the
                    whole earth would have become, had man but fulfilled the
                    Creator's glorious plan."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 62.
                      What welcome will be given the righteous by the King?
                    Matt. 25:34.

                       What emotion does Isaiah attribute to the redeemed as they
                    enter the renewed earth? lsa. 35:10.

 THINK IT THROUGH      The cross of Christ is to be the science and song of the
                    redeemed throughout eternity. How can I make it a part of my
                    contemplation and a part of my song now?

                        "The great plan of redemption results in fully bringing back
                    the world into God's favor. All that was lost by sin is restored.
                    Not only man but the earth is redeemed, to be the eternal abode
                    of the obedient. For six thousand years Satan has struggled
                    to maintain possession of the earth. Now God's original purpose
                    in its creation is accomplished. 'The saints of the Most High
                    shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom forever, even
                    forever and ever.' Daniel 7:18."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page

                        "It is only to those who are waiting in hope and faith that
                    Christ will appear, without sin unto salvation. Many have the
                    theory of the truth who know not the power of godliness. If
                    the word of God dwelt in the heart, it would control the life.
                    Faith, purity, and conformity to the will of God would testify

              Part 2      "And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and
                       them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his
       VICTORY OVER    image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name,
          THE BEAST    stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God."
           Rev. 15:2
                          Christ's death and victory give hope in the struggles and
                       victories of the servants of God everywhere. As we are led
                       through a life of discipline, told to do without this or that, con-
                       tend with this or that selfishness, pressed hard by this or that
                       sorrow, tempted to give up trust in God's care, pressured to
                       be indifferent and reckless, we should think of the struggle of
                       the Lamb of God. Our struggle and victory today is no mere
                       disjointed, separated thing, done alone and without lasting
                       effect; but if we are true to our calling, it will be a part of the
                       great victory of the Lamb already won.

                           What will be the fate of the beast and those who give their
                       allegiance to it? Rev. 19:20. (See also Rev. 18:6, 7, 20, 21;
                       cf. Dan. 7:11.)

                         What does the psalmist say about the security afforded the
                       godly under siege? Ps. 91:1-7.

 THINK IT THROUGH         The subjects of Christ's kingdom are being gathered even
                       now into a spiritual fellowship called the "kingdom of grace."
                       What assures me that I am a member of that fellowship?
                       Can those who behold my life see the difference between
                       those who serve God and those who do not?

                          "The eye of God, looking down the ages, was fixed upon
                       the crisis which His people are to meet, when earthly powers
                       shall be arrayed against them. Like the captive exile, they will
                       be in fear of death by starvation or by violence. But the Holy
                       One who divided the Red Sea before Israel, will manifest His
                       mighty power and turn their captivity. 'They shall be Mine,
                       saith the Lord of hosts, in that day when I make up My jewels;
                       and I will spare them, as a man spareth His own son that serveth
                       Him.' Malachi 3:17. If the blood of Christ's faithful witnesses
                       were shed at this time, it would not, like the blood of the mar-
                       tyrs, be as seed sown to yield a harvest for God. Their fidelity
                       would not be a testimony to convince others of the truth; for
                       the obdurate heart has beaten back the waves of mercy until
                       they return no more. If the righteous were now left to fall a
                       prey to their enemies, it would be a triumph for the prince of
                       darkness. . . . [Ps. 27:5; Isa. 26:20, 21 quoted.] Glorious will
                       be the deliverance of those who have patiently waited for His
                       coming and whose names are written in the book of life."—The

            Part 3       "And there was war in heaven." "And the great dragon was
                      cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which
    VICTORY OVER      deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and
      THE DRAGON      his angels were cast out with him."
       Rev. 12:7, 9
                         The dragon primarily symbolizes Satan, the archenemy of
                      Christ and His people. It is used also of powers through whom
                      Satan works his will. In the days of Christ's earthly life pagan
                      Rome constituted the "dragon." Later, papal Rome became the
                      instrument of Satan's nefarious designs.
                         How was Jesus delivered from the dragon immediately after
                      His birth? Matt. 2:13.

                           "The prince of evil exerted all his power and cunning to
                      destroy Jesus; for he saw that the Saviour's mercy and love,
                      His compassion and pitying tenderness, were representing to
                      the world the character of God. Satan contested every claim put
                      forth by the Son of God and employed men as his agents to
                      fill the Saviour's life with suffering and sorrow."—The Great
                      Controversy, page 501.
                           Satan failed to destroy the Infant Jesus; later he failed to hold
                      the Lord of life in the tomb after the crucifixion. The ascension
                      signalized Satan's utter defeat.
                        Repeatedly baffled, against whom does the dragon finally
                      vent his wrath? Rev. 12:17.

                         With whom will be the final victory? Rev. 17:14.

 THINK IT THROUGH        The flood of persecution was stemmed by the association of
                      many European princes with the Reformation movement. How
                      did the opening up of America as a new nation also help?

                          "Satan's work of ruin is forever ended. For six thousand
                      years he has wrought his will, filling the earth with woe and
                      causing grief throughout the universe. The whole creation has
                      groaned and travailed together in pain. Now God's creatures
                      are forever delivered from his presence and temptations. 'The
                      whole earth is at rest, and is quiet: they [the righteous] break
                      forth into singing.' Isaiah 14:7. And a shout of praise and
                      triumph ascends from the whole loyal universe. 'The voice of
                      a great multitude,' as the voice of many waters, and as the
                      voice of mighty thunderings,' is heard, saying: 'Alleluia: for the
                      Lord God omnipotent reigneth.' Revelation 19:6."—The Great

The Victory of Jesus and His People LESSON 13                         ❑   Wednesday
                                                                        September 26

            Part 4        "And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet
   CHRIST AND HIS     that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them
                      that had received the mark of the beast, and them that wor-
  PEOPLE CONQUER      shipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of
        Rev. 19:20    fire burning with brimstone."


                         As a result of immigration and propaganda, the United
                      States, which in its beginnings was basically Protestant, today
                      has nearly two and a half times as many Roman Catholics as
                      the largest Protestant denomination, the Southern Baptists.
                      Bertrand Russell has predicted that in thirty years America is
                      likely to be "predominantly Catholic."
                         What actions of the lamblike beast indicate the extent to
                      which this nation will become the instrument for papal author-
                      ity? Rev. 13:12.

                         To what political eminence will the papacy be restored in
                      the latter days? Rev. 17:12, 13, 17.


                          Already there are evidences of a desire on the part of states-
                      men and leaders of both Europe and America to invoke the aid
                      of the papacy in the establishment of international harmony.
                         What last appeal will God make to those who are being
                      drawn into the fold of antichrist? Rev. 18:4.


                          What peculiar marks will distinguish the worshipers of God
                      in the last days? Rev. 14:12.


 THINK IT THROUGH         Standing apart from all compromise with Rome, the last-day
                      church will hold fast to the "faith once delivered unto the
                      saints," and obedience to all the "commandments of God."
                      What will it mean to be faithful under these most adverse con-
                      ditions? Am I, by God's grace, faithful to Him now?


                          "The book of life contains the names of all who have ever
                      entered the service of God. Jesus bade His disciples: 'Rejoice,
                      because your names are written in heaven.' Luke 10:20. Paul
                      speaks of his faithful fellow workers, 'whose names are in the
                      book of life.' Philippians 4:3. Daniel, looking down to 'a time
                      of trouble, such as never was,' declares that God's people
                      shall be delivered, 'everyone that shall be found written in the
                      book.' And the revelator says that those only shall enter the
                      city of God whose names 'are written in the Lamb's book of
                      life.' Daniel 12:1; Revelation 21:27."—The Great Controversy,

The Victory of Jesus and His People          LESSON 13                 ❑   Thursday
                                                                      September 27

           Part 5     "I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and
 THE FINAL VICTORY prevailed against them; until the Ancient of days came, and
                   judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the
     Dan. 1:21, 22 time came that the saints possessed the kingdom."

                        The Bible describes the false and counterfeit religions of
                    Satan that we might shun them and choose the gospel of Christ.
                    The books of Daniel and the Revelation show the awful results
                    of rebellion that we might appreciate the reward of righteous-
                    ness and the blessing of obedience.
                        The final victory will come after the people of God have put
                    on the garments of salvation and have accepted the principles
                    of God's government.
                        "By implanting in their hearts the principles of His word, the
                    Holy Spirit develops in men the attributes of God. The light of
                    His glory—His character—is to shine forth in His followers. . . .
                        "At this time a message from God is to be proclaimed, a
                    message illuminating in its influence and saving in its power.
                    His character is to be made known. Into the darkness of the
                    world is to be shed the light of His glory, the light of His
                    goodness, mercy, and truth....
                        "Thus in the night of spiritual darkness God's glory is to
                    shine forth through His church. . . .
                        "Christ has made every provision that His church shall be
                    a transformed body, illumined with the Light of the world, pos-
                    sessing the glory of Emmanuel. It is His purpose that every
                    Christian shall be surrounded with a spiritual atmosphere of
                    light and peace."—Christ's Object Lessons, pages 414-419.
                        "'You have washed your robes in My blood, stood stiffly for
                    My truth, enter in.' We all marched in and felt that we had a
                    perfect right in the city."—Early Writings, page 17.

 THINK IT THROUGH       Where will the victory of the remnant be celebrated? By
                    what means does God distinguish those who are to take part
                    in this event?

                       "Upon the crystal sea before the throne, that sea of glass
                    as it were mingled with fire,—so resplendent is it with the glory
                    of God,—are gathered the company that have 'gotten the vic-
                    tory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and
                    over the number of his name.' With the Lamb upon Mount Zion,
                    'having the harps of God,' they stand, the hundred and forty

              Part 6      "And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God
      NO MORE CURSE    and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve
                       him."
           Rev. 22:3
                           The curse was pronounced after the first transgression. But
                       in the time here foretold all will be reversed. There is the curse
                       upon individuals, as it fell upon Cain (Gen. 4:11), and the curse
                       upon cities, as it fell upon Jericho (Joshua 6:1-5). But this curse
                       will cease to be, according to the Scripture, for there will be
                       no iniquity, and hence no devastation. And there will be no one
                       to trouble God's people and bring the curse upon the inheritors
                       of the land.
                          Beyond our present restricted vision, what great joy awaits
                       the child of God? 1 Cor. 2:9; 13:12.
                           "There the redeemed shall know, even as also they are
                       known. The loves and sympathies which God Himself has
                       planted in the soul shall there find truest and sweetest exercise.
                       The pure communion with holy beings, the harmonious social
                       life with the blessed angels and with the faithful ones of all
                       ages, . . . the sacred ties that bind together 'the whole family

                       . . . 'The inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that
                       dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.' .. . Isaiah 33:24."
                       —The Great Controversy, page 676.
 THINK IT THROUGH         Do we have enough in our own experience to teach us the
                       meaning of the curse? How wonderful when the heavy load of
                       toil, poverty, infirmities, and death will be shaken off in ever-
                       lasting glory!
                            "In the City of God 'there shall be no night.' None will need
                       or desire repose. There will be no weariness in doing the will
                       of God and offering praise to His name. We shall ever feel the
                       freshness of the morning and shall ever be far from its close.
                       . . . The glory of God and the Lamb floods the Holy City with
                       unfading light."—The Great Controversy, page 676.
                           "To everyone who offers himself to the Lord for service,
                       withholding nothing, is given power for the attainment of mea-
                       sureless results. For these God will do great things. He will
                       work upon the minds of men so that, even in this world, there
                       shall be seen in their lives a fulfillment of the promise of the
                       future state."—The Ministry of Healing, page 160.
