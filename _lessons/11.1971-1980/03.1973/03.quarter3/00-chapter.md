 ADULT SABBATH SCHOOL LESSONS
        Thirteenth Sabbath Offering Overflow
             December 29, 1973—Trans-Africa Division

    The Trans-Africa Division was greatly encouraged by the funds re-
ceived from the Thirteenth Sabbath Overflow Offering for the third quar-
ter of 1972. We are happy to report that, as a result of your liberal offer-
ing, we received sufficient funds to build an administration complex on
our Gitwe Training School campus, which serves a constituency of over
100,000 members in the countries of Rwanda and Burundi. We were also
able to complete the administration building which had been under con-
struction for many years at Kivu in northern Zaire. Surplus funds also
assisted in the improvement and expansion of the boys' dormitory there.
    Again we come to you with an appeal for funds that will help with two
much-needed projects—the improvement and expansion of the student
housing at our Helderberg College and the erection of a publishing
house at Malamulo in Malawi.
    We have not been able to expand the 50-year-old housing facilities
for our students at Helderberg for many years. The lack of money has
made it necessary for both academy and college students to share the
same facilities, with as many as four and at times, five in a room de-
signed for two.
    For some time we have been operating a small publishing house on
the campus of Malamulo which has provided employment and training
for some of the students at the college. This plant, with restricted capi-
tal, has attempted to meet the printing needs of our Malawi Union Mis-
sion, providing to the best of its ability literature that is needed by our
colporteur evangelists. Developments of recent years have indicated that
if this plant could be modernized and expanded it would not only make
a valuable contribution in supplying literature for the union mission but
for the neighboring unions as well.
    As we come to you for special help for these two projects which will
benefit from the Christmas offering, we sincerely hope that you will
remember Trans-Africa in a special way by giving a little more than you
had intended to give. This will not only make your fellow believers in
Trans-Africa happy but will reveal to your Saviour, who was born as a
babe in Bethlehem two milleniums ago, your great desire to hasten His
coming as "King of kings and Lord of lords."
                                        Merle L. Mills, President
                                        Trans-Africa Division

                   GENERAL INTRODUCTION
    The memory of each person extends back only to a point several years
after his birth. He carries about in himself the evidence that he has ar-
rived very recently on the scene and is not responsible for the surround-
ings into which he has come. It was true even of Adam and Eve that their
environment preceded them. Nor are individuals responsible for their
own existence.
    The Bible points to God as the originator of the world and of the life
it contains. This is God's world and we are His people. God has bestowed
on each of us certain abilities and materials for use during our brief
existence. We are in charge of these goods, and the question that con-
fronts every responsible person is: To whose benefit shall these goods be
used? The Christian answer is: To the benefit of God, the Owner.
    The natural selfishness of man leads him to misappropriate the bless-
ings of God and use them in a way that is foreign to God's intentions.
    "Employed to bless others, his gifts increase. Shut up to self-serving
they diminish, and are finally withdrawn. He who refuses to impart that
 which he has received will at last find that he has nothing to give. He is
 consenting to a process that surely dwarfs and finally destroys the facul-
ties of the soul.
     "Let none suppose that they can live a life of selfishness, and then,
 having served their own interests, enter into the joy of their Lord. In the
 joy of unselfish love they could not participate. They would not be fitted
 for the heavenly courts. They could not appreciate the pure atmosphere
 of love that pervades heaven. The voices of the angels and the music of
 their harps would not satisfy them. To their minds the science of heaven
 would be as an enigma.
     "In the great judgment day those who have not worked for Christ,
 those who have drifted along, carrying no responsibility, thinking of
 themselves, pleasing themselves, will be placed by the Judge of all the
 earth with those who did evil. They receive the same condemnation."
 —"Christ's Object Lessons," pages 364, 365.
      The lessons for this quarter focus on the management, by each of us,
 of all that God has placed at our disposal. The hope that goes with the
 distribution of these lessons is that each of us might see himself as a
 manager for God, seeking to advance His cause and His kingdom with
 whatever is in his hand.

          The Blessing of Daily Study
   "Every day some portion of time should be appropri-
ated to the study of the lessons, not merely in learning to
mechanically repeat the words, while the mind does not
comprehend the meaning; but to go to the very founda-
tion, and become familiar with what is brought out in the
lesson."—"Counsels on Sabbath School Work," page 53.




                       My Pledge
   As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge
of the Scriptures, I pledge myself to the careful and
prayerful study of some portion of my Sabbath School
lesson each day of the week.

GOD'S OWNERSHIP                                           September 30-October 6

                                                                         September 30

              Part 1      What seemingly permanent things are compared with
              GOD IS    God's existence?
            ETERNAL        "Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou
             Ps. 90:2   hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting
                        to everlasting, thou art God."

                            It is impossible for man fully to comprehend the eternity of
                        God who alone sits enthroned as Lord of time, without begin-
                        ning and without end. But we accept God's eternal existence
                         by faith. The problem that the human mind encounters in think-
                        ing of the eternal existence of God is very simliar to the prob-
                        lem of the infinity of space. Our minds boggle at both. The limit
                        of our understanding is stated in the opening words of the
                        scriptures— "In the beginning God—" Gen. 1:1.
                            With the truth of God's eternal existence we begin our study
                        of stewardship.
                            "God is from eternity in the past to eternity in the future
                        (see Ps. 93:2; Prov. 8:23; Micah 5:2; Hab. 1:12). He is 'the
                        Ancient of days' (Dan. 7:9). There could not be a more sublime
                        statement of the eternity of God. The man who recognizes the
                        eternity of God and regards his own life as related to the
                        Eternal, has 'a powerful stimulus to dignified, worthy living."
                        —SDA Bible Commentary, on Ps. 90:2.
                            "No finite mind can fully comprehend the existence, the
                        power, the wisdom, or the works of the Infinite One. . . . [Job
                        11:7-9 quoted]. The mightiest intellects of earth cannot com-
                        prehend God. Men may be ever searching, ever learning, and
                        still there is an infinity beyond."—Patriarchs and Prophets,

    THINK IT THROUGH        In what ways can God's eternal existence have meaning

                        the Source and Sustainer of all, is alone entitled to supreme
                        reverence and worship. Man is forbidden to give to any other
                        object the first place in his affections or his service. Whatever
                        we cherish that tends to lessen our love for God or to interfere
                        with the service due Him, of that do we make a god."—Patri-

God's Ownership      LESSON 1                                         ❑   Monday
                                                                         October 1

          Part 2    What are some attributes of God that belong only to per-
          GOD IS sona I beings?
       A PERSON      "But thou, 0 Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gra-
        Ps. 86:15 cious, long-suffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth."

                        These attributes are possessed only by persons, never by
                    impersonal powers. God is a personal, living being. He per-
                    sonally created the universe, and He personally owns it.
                        "It was He who in the material world provided that every
                    desire implanted should be met. It was He who created the
                    human soul, with its capacity for knowing and for loving. And
                    He is not in Himself such as to leave the demands of the soul
                    unsatisfied. No intangible principle, no impersonal essence or
                    mere abstraction, can satisfy the needs and longings of human
                    beings in this life of struggle with sin and sorrow and pain. It
                    is not enough to believe in law and force, in things that have
                     no pity, and never hear the cry for help. We need to know of
                     an almighty arm that will hold us up, of an infinite Friend that
                     pities us. We need to clasp a hand that is warm, to trust in a
                     heart full of tenderness. And even so God has in His word
                     revealed Himself."—Education, page 133.

                       By what outstanding means has God been revealed as a
                    personal being? Heb. 1:2, 3; 1 Tim. 3:16; 1 John 1:1-4.

                       One of the ploys of Satan is to lead men to believe in a
                    depersonalized God. God is thus regarded as a creative force,
                    natural law, or eternal energy. Such a view of God strikes a
                    blow at the very heart of Christianity, for it leaves no room for
                    Jesus as the revelation of the Father. Human beings can have
                    no sense of responsibility to an impersonal force. Only persons
                    are owners, and an impersonal view of God makes divine
                    ownership impossible. The logical result of an impersonal
                    view of God is for man to look upon himself as owner, and
                    thus man would put himself in God's place.

  THINK IT THOUGH       In my daily activities how can I be conscious of a per-
                     sonal God who sees and loves me and to whom I am re-
                     sponsible?
                       Nature is not God, nor was it ever God. The voice of nature
                    testifies of God, but nature is not God. As His created work, it
                    simply bears a testimony to God's power. Deity is the author
                    of nature. The natural world has, in itself, no power but that
                    which God supplies. There is a personal God, the Father; there
                    is a personal Christ, the Son."—Selected Messages, Bk. 1,

             Part 3      "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth."
        GOD IS THE       "Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and
                      the heavens are the work of thy hands."
          CREATOR
           Gen. 1:1
                         Since God is the Creator, then He existed before the things
         Ps. 102:25
                      and beings of His creation. He therefore exists distinctly above
                      that which He has created.

                         Why do people belong to the Lord? Ps. 100:3.

                         What God created, God owns. He created the universe, and
                      thus it belongs to Him. Only God can create in the strictest
                      sense. Only He could bring into existence the original sub-
                      stances of the cosmos. Man, in his creative work, is dependent
                      on what God has created. God is always the ultimate owner
                      of all things.

                         In the first angel's message, who are the world's inhabi-
                      tants called upon to worship? Rev. 14:6, 7.

                          "The work of creation can never be explained by science.
                      What science can explain the mystery of life?
                          "The theory that God did not create matter when He brought
                      the world into existence is without foundation. In the forma-
                      tion of our world, God was not indebted to preexisting matter.
                      On the contrary, all things, material or spiritual, stood up before
                      the Lord Jehovah at His voice and were created for His own
                      purpose. The heavens and all the host of them, the earth and
                      all things therein, are not only the work of His hand; they
                      came into existence by the breath of His mouth."—Testimonies,
                      Vol. 8, pp. 258, 259.

 THINK IT THROUGH        What evidences do I see about me that there is a per-
                      sonal, Creator-God?

                         "There are many who in their hearts charge God with being
                      a hard master because He claims their possessions and their
                      service. But we can bring to God nothing that is not already
                      His. 'All things come of Thee,' said King David; 'and of Thine

                      not only by creation, but by redemption. All the blessings of
                      this life and of the life to come are delivered to us stamped
                      with the cross of Calvary. Therefore the charge that God is a

          Part 4      "But now thus saith the Lord that created thee, 0 Jacob,
          GOD IS    and he that formed thee, 0 Israel, Fear not: for I have re-
                    deemed thee, I have called thee by thy name; thou art mine."
       REDEEMER
        lsa. 43:1      God's message to Israel, assuring of redemption by the
                    Creator, is pertinent to God's people today. It is because of
                    man's rejection of God's claims on him by virtue of creation
                    that redemption is necessary.
                       "Man does not belong to himself; he has no right to use
                    his powers according to the wishes and promptings of his un-
                    converted body. He is the property of God by creation and by
                    redemption. Man is bound to live mentally, physically, and
                    spiritually as God directs, to the glory of His name, and not to
                    the gratification of fleshly desires. The converted man is, in-
                    deed, a willing slave of Jesus Christ . . . , who lives only to
                    please his Master."—SDA Bible Commentary, on 1 Cor. 6:19.
                       What reason does Paul cite as the basis of God's owner-
                    ship of man? 1 Cor. 6:19, 20.

                       The redemption through Jesus Christ includes not only man,
                    but his possessions as well.
                       "All things come of God. We have nothing that we have not
                    received; and, more than this, we have nothing that has not
                    been purchased for us by the blood of Christ. Everything we
                    possess comes to us stamped with the cross, bought with the
                    blood that is precious above all estimate, because it is the life
                    of God."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, page 66.

 THINK IT THROUGH      What are the implications of recognizing that God by
                    creation and redemption is the owner of myself and of my
                    possessions?

                        "All men have been bought with this infinite price. By pour-
                    ing the whole treasury of heaven into this world, by giving us
                    in Christ all heaven, God has purchased the will, the affections,
                    the mind, the soul, of every human being. Whether believers or
                    unbelievers, all men are the Lord's property. All are called to
                    do service for Him, and for the manner in which they have met
                    this claim, all will be required to render an account at the great
                    judgment day."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 326.
                        "To the death of Christ we owe even this earthly life. The
                    bread we eat is the purchase of His broken body. The water
                    we drink is bought by His spilled blood. Never one, saint or
                    sinner, eats his daily food, but he is nourished by the body and
                     the blood of Christ. The cross of Calvary is stamped on every
                     loaf. It is reflected in every water spring."—The Desire of Ages,

           Part 5      "The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof; the world,
GOD-MAN RELATION     and they that dwell therein."
         Ps. 24:1       God's eternity, His personality, His creatorship, and His act
                     of redemption combined together make Him always the abso-
                     lute owner of all creation.

                        What arrangement served as a continued reminder to
                     Israel that God was the owner of their land? Lev. 25:23, 24.

                         "Though God had given the land of Palestine to His people,
                     He still held title to it. The Israelites were stewards, not own-
                     ers."—SDA Bible Commentary, on Lev. 25:23.
                        It is God who has made available the elements and materials
                     from which man produces the goods he claims to own. All come
                     from the earth. Man himself is nourished by the earth's prod-
                     ucts. "God desires Christians to respect the liberty that He has
                     in so marvelous a manner given them. In Christ is vested the
                     ownership of every man. Man should not be another man's
                     property. God has bought mankind."—Ellen G. White Com-

 THINK IT THROUGH       How many production steps are there, from original source
                     to consumer, for some commonly used items in your home?
                     Do you think this "production distance" can have an influ-
                     ence on the God-man relation?

                         "All that we have is from God. He lays His hand upon our
                     possessions, saying: 'I am the rightful owner of the whole
                     universe; these are My goods.' "—Testimonies, Vol. 9, p. 245.
                         "All the good that man enjoys comes because of the mercy
                     of God. He is the great and bountiful Giver. His love is manifest
                     to all in the abundant provision made for man. He has given
                     us probationary time in which to form characters for the courts
                     above. And it is not because He needs anything that He asks
                     us to reserve a part of our possessions for Him.. ..
                         "Did He not give His only-begotten Son because He loved
                     us and desired to save us from death? And shall not our grati-
                     tude offerings flow into His treasury to be drawn therefrom to
                     advance His kingdom in the earth? Since God is the owner of
                     all our goods, shall not gratitude to Him prompt us to make
                     freewill offerings and thank offerings, thus acknowledging His
                     ownership of soul, body, spirit, and property? Had God's plan
                     been followed, means would now be flowing into His treasury;
                     and funds to enable ministers to enter new fields, and workers
                     to unite with ministers in lifting up the standard of truth in the
                     dark places of the earth, would be abundant."—Testimonies,

God's Ownership LESSON 1                                                    ❑ Friday
                                                                            October 5

           Part 6      Read Luke 12:18-20.
MAN-GOD RELATION        "By the parable of the foolish rich man, Christ showed the
    Luke 12:18-20   folly of those who make the world their all. This man had re-
                    ceived everything from God. The sun had been permitted to
                    shine upon his land; for its rays fall on the just and on the
                    unjust. The showers of heaven descend on the evil and on
                    the good. The Lord had caused vegetation to flourish, and the
                    fields to bring forth abundantly. The rich man was in perplexity
                    as to what he should do with his produce. His barns were full
                    to overflowing, and he had no place to put the surplus of his
                    harvest. He did not think of God, from whom all his mercies
                    had come. He did not realize that God had made him a stew-
                    ard of His goods that he might help the needy. He had a
                    blessed opportunity of being God's almoner, but he thought
                    only of ministering to his owner comfort. . . .
                        "This man's aims were no higher than those of the beasts
                    that perish. He lived as if there were no God, no heaven, no
                    future life; as if everything he possessed were his own, and
                    he owed nothing to God or man."—Christ's Object Lessons,
                    pages 256-258.
                        God is the absolute owner of all things. Man is always a
                    steward of God's goods. A steward is a person who manages
                    the business of another. The person who was once called a
                     steward could be called in modern English a manager or busi-
                    ness manager. This stewardship, or management, entrusted
                     to man includes even the life of the steward himself, for man
                    is not self-created.

                       What is the primary qualification of a steward? 1 Cor. 4:2.

                       A steward controls the goods of the owner, but control is
                    not ownership. Man's control is temporary; God's ownership
                    is perpetual. Man's control is relative; God's ownership is ab-
                    solute. There is no such thing as absolute human ownership.
                    Man may control goods for a lifetime, but at his death his pos-
                    sessions pass on to another, who in turn is tested concerning
                    their use.

 THINK IT THROUGH      Consider the pattern of your daily life. How does it say,
                    "God, I belong to You"?

                       "To live for self is to perish. Covetousness, the desire of
                    benefit for self's sake, cuts the soul off from life. It is the spirit
                    of Satan to get, to draw to self. It is the spirit of Christ to give,
                    to sacrifice self for the good of others [1 John 5:11, 12 quoted]."

                      certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also
                      his offspring."

                         Man's life not only originated with God but it continues by
                      His power. Man has nothing in and of himself that perpetuates
                      his life.
                         "The mechanism of the human body cannot be fully under-

                      beating heart, the throbbing pulse, every nerve and muscle in
                      the living organism, is kept in order and activity by the power
                      of an ever-present God."—The Ministry of Healing, page 417.
                         What is the Christian purpose for life's continuance? Ps.
                      91:15, 16.

 THINK IT THROUGH       If man regards life's origin and continuance as from God,
                      how should he use his life?

                          "Christ came to this world to reveal the love of God. His
                      followers are to continue the work which He began. Let us
                      strive to help and strengthen one another. Seeking the good
                      of others is the way in which true happiness can be found.
                      Man does not work against his own interest by loving God and
                      his fellow men. The more unselfish his spirit, the happier he
                      is, because he is fulfilling God's purpose for him. The breath
                      of God is breathed through him, filling him with gladness. To
                      him life is a sacred trust, precious in his sight because given

             Part 2      "1 beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God,
      STEWARDSHIP     that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable
                      unto God, which is your reasonable service."
       OF THE BODY
          Rom. 12:1       "Life is a gift of God. Our bodies have been given us to use
                      in God's service, and He desires that we shall care for and
                      appreciate them. We are possessed of physical as well as men-
                      tal faculties. Our impulses and passions have their seat in the
                      body, and therefore ye must do nothing that would defile this
                      entrusted possession. Our bodies must be kept in the best
                      possible condition physically, and under the most spiritual
                      influences, in order that we may make the best use of our
                      talents....
                          "A misuse of the body shortens that period of time which
                      God designs shall be used in His service. By allowing ourselves
                      to form wrong habits, by keeping late hours, by gratifying ap-
                      petite at the expense of health, we lay the foundation for feeble-
                      ness. By neglecting to take physical exercise, by overworking
                      mind or body, we unbalance the nervous system. Those who
                      thus shorten their lives by disregarding nature's laws are guilty
                      of robbery toward God. We have no right to neglect or misuse
                      the body, the mind, or the strength, which should be used to
                      offer God consecrated service."—Counsels on Health, page 41.

                         What is to be the Christian's object of bodily activities?
                      1 Cor. 10:31, 32.

                         Guidelines based on Biblical principles for the care of the
                      body are contained in the health messages of the spirit of
                      prophecy. One purpose of these messages is to teach the
                      church a stewardship of the body that is based on Christian
                      principles.

                        Do you recognize any way in which stewardship of the
                      body is related to the three angels' messages? Rev. 14:6-12.

 THINK IT THROUGH         Am I caring for and using my body as a steward would
                      or as an owner?

                          "Many seem to think they have a right to treat their own
                      bodies as they please, but they forget that their bodies are not
                      their own. Their Creator, who formed them, has claims upon
                      them that they cannot rightly throw off. Every needless trans-
                      gression of the laws which God has established in our being
                      is virtually a violation of the law of God, and is as great a sin
                      in the sight of Heaven as to break the Ten Commandments.
                      Ignorance upon this important subject is sin. . . . "—Counsels

Man's Stewardship LESSON 2                                             ❑ Tuesday
                                                                        October 9

          Part 3       What reason does the psalmist give for desiring to be
STEWARDS OF TIME    taught to number days?
       Ps. 90:12       "So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our
                    hearts unto wisdom."

                        To examine the stewardship of time is really just another
                    way of viewing life, for Franklin's observation is correct that
                    time is "the stuff that life is made of." To use time wisely is to
                    use life wisely. Ellen White spoke .of time as "life's great capi-
                    tal" and further claimed that the "waste of time is a waste of
                    intellect."—Testimonies, Vol. 3, p. 146.
                        "The cultivation of the intellect need not be prevented by
                    poverty, humble origin, or unfavorable surroundings. Only let
                    the moments be treasured. A few moments here and a few
                    there, that might be frittered away in aimless talk; the morning
                    hours so often wasted in bed, the time spent in traveling on
                    trams or railway cars, or waiting at the station; the moments
                    of waiting for meals, waiting for those who are tardy in keeping
                    an appointment—if ,a book were kept at hand, and these frag-
                    ments of time were ,improved in study, reading, or careful
                     thought, what imiglit not be accomplished. A resolute purpose,
                     persistent induStry, and careful economy of time, will enable
                     men to acquire knowledge and mental discipline which will
                     qualify them for almost any position of influence and useful-
                     ness."—Christ's Object Lessons, pages 343, 344.

                       What is the significance of Sabbath time? Ex. 20:11.

                       "When man observes the Sabbath he is recognizing God's
                    claim upon his life, his time, his strength. The Sabbath was
                    intended as a test of man's loyalty to the God who made him,
                    just as much as the tree of knowledge of good and evil was a
                    test of the loyalty of Adam and Eve. God has given us all things
                    to enjoy; His gifts are for our good; but to enjoy these gifts
                    now and in the eternal years, we must show evidence of our
                    loyalty by keeping the day God set apart for a holy use. This
                    requirement was made not only of those who are recognized
                    as the servants of God but of all mankind. 'The sabbath was
                    made for man,' made to be a blessing to him. In it he should
                    rest from labor. In keeping the Sabbath holy man would be
                    recognizing his relationship to his Creator."—S. A. Wellman,
                    Your Stewardship and Mine, page 58.

 THINK IT THROUGH     How am I using my leisure time? Does this use glorify
                    God or merely give self-satisfaction?

Man's Stewardship LESSON 2                                          ❑ Wednesday
                                                                      October 10

            Part 4      What was man's first work?
      STEWARDS OF       "And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the
         ABILITIES   garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it."
         Gen. 2:15
                         God gave man abilities—the skill and energy of the mind
                     and the body—and then He gave him dominion and respon-
                     sibility that matched these abilities.
                         "Adam was crowned king in Eden. To him was given do-
                     minion over every living thing that God had created. The Lord
                     blessed Adam and Eve with intelligence such as He had not
                     given to any other creature. He made Adam the rightful sov-
                     ereign over all the works of His hands. Man, made in the divine
                     image, could contemplate and appreciate the glorious works
                     of God in nature."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Com-
                     mentary, Vol. 1, p. 1082.
                         The ability which God gives to men today is really a capacity
                     that can be developed into special skills. "The development of
                     all our powers is the first duty we owe to God and to our fel-
                     low men. No one who is not growing daily in capability and
                     usefulness is fulfilling the purpose of life. In making a profes-
                     sion of faith in Christ we pledge ourselves to become all that
                     it is possible for us to be as workers for the Master, and we
                     should cultivate every faculty to the highest degree of per-
                     fection, that we may do the greatest amount of good of which
                     we are capable."—Christ's Object Lessons, pages 329, 330.
                         It is not the quality of the ability by which God judges man,
                     but by the faithfulness in which the ability is employed.
                         "A man may be in the active service of God while engaged
                     in the ordinary, everyday duties—while felling trees, clearing
                     the ground, or following the plow. The mother who trains her
                     children for Christ is as truly working for God as is the min-
                     ister in the pulpit....
                         "It is not the possession of splendid talents that enables
                     us to render acceptable service, but the conscientious per-
                     formance of daily duties, the contented spirit, the unaffected,
                     sincere interest in the welfare of others. In the humblest lot
                     true excellence may be found. The commonest tasks, wrought
                     with loving faithfulness, are beautiful in God's sight."—Proph-
                     ets and Kings, page 219.

 THINK IT THROUGH       How faithfully am I developing and using my abilities?

                        "Had happiness consisted in doing nothing, man, in his
                     state of holy innocence, would have been left unemployed. But
                     He who created man knew what would be for his happiness;
                     and no sooner had He created him than He gave him his ap-
                     pointed work."—The Adventist Home, page 27.

Man's Stewardship LESSON 2                                          ❑ Thursday
                                                                     October 11

           Part 5    Read Gen. 2:16, 17.
    STEWARDS OF
                     The world and its contents were given over to man's man-
       MATERIAL agement, but all of these really belonged to God. The fruit of
    POSSESSIONS one tree in the garden of Eden was withheld from man's use.
     Gen. 2:16, 11 On this point man could only obey or disobey. This was a test
                    on the use of possessions.
                       "This tree God reserved as a constant reminder of His own-
                    ership of all. Thus He gave them opportunity to demonstrate
                    their faith and trust in Him by their perfect obedience to His
                    requirements."—Testimonies, Vol. 6, p. 386.

                       What did God warn would be the results to man if he
                    used the world's goods contrary to divine command? Gen.
                    2:16, 17.

                       After man's expulsion from Eden, the tithe became a test to
                    man as the tree of knowledge of good and evil had been a
                    test in the garden. "He places His treasures in the hands of
                    men, but requires that one tenth shall be faithfully laid aside
                    for His work. He requires this portion to be placed in His
                    treasury. It is to be rendered to Him as His own; it is sacred
                    and is to be used for sacred purposes, for the support of those
                    who carry the message of salvation to all parts of the world. He
                    reserves this portion, that means may ever be flowing into His
                    treasure house, and that the light of truth may be carried to
                    those who are nigh and those who are afar off. By faithfully
                    obeying this requirement we acknowledge that all belongs to
                    God."—Testimonies, Vol. 6, p. 386.
                       What reason did Jesus give for His warning against cove-
                    tousness? Luke 12:15.

                       "The system of benevolence was arranged to prevent that
                    great evil, covetousness. Christ saw that in the prosecution of
                    business the love of riches would be the greatest cause of
                    rooting true godliness out of the heart. He saw that the love of
                    money would freeze deep and hard into men's souls, stopping
                    the flow of generous impulses and closing their senses to the
                    wants of the suffering and the afflicted."—Testimonies, Vol. 3,
                    p. 547.

 THINK IT THROUGH      What is the focal point of my life?

                        "God's hand can prosper or withhold; and he frequently
                    withholds from one while He seems to prosper another. All this
                    is to test and prove men, and to reveal the heart."—Testimo-

Man's Stewardship         LESSON 2                                       ❑ Friday
                                                                         October 12

             Part 6      What is the ultimate test of all of life?
     TESTED BY GOD       "And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I
        Matt. 25:40   say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the
                      least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me."

                         "Disrobe yourselves of selfishness, and see if there are not
                      many whom you can help and bless with your homes, your
                      sympathy, your love, and in pointing them to the Lamb of God,
                      who taketh away the sins of the world. Do you wish to make
                      any sacrifice to save souls? Jesus, the dear Saviour, is pre-
                      paring a home for you; and why will not you in your turn
                      prepare a home for those who need it, and in thus doing imita-
                      tate the example of your Master? If you are not willing to do
                      this, when you shall feel that you need a habitation in the
                      heavens, none will be awarded you. For Christ declares: 'In-
                      asmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it
                      not to Me.' You that have been selfish, studying your own ease
                      and advantage all your life, your hours of probation are fast
                      closing. What are you doing to redeem your life of selfishness
                      and uselessness? Wake up! wake up!"—Testimonies, Vol. 2,
                      p. 30.
                          Before Adam and Eve could be eternally secure, they had to
                      develop a character that could be trusted for eternity. In the
                      process of this development, they would be confronted with
                      the decision to be obedient or disobedient to God. They failed
                      the test.
                         "Our first parents, though created innocent and holy, were
                      not placed beyond the possibility of wrongdoing. God made
                      them free moral agents, capable of appreciating the wisdom
                      and benevolence of His character and the justice of His re-
                      quirements, and with full liberty to yield or to withhold obe-
                      dience. They were to enjoy communion with God and with
                      holy angels; but before they could be rendered eternally se-
                      cure, their loyalty must be tested."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
                      page 48.
                         From then till now God has been testing people's characters
                      that they might see and remedy their needs.

                          In our lesson this week, we have noted that God gave man
                      life, taught him how to use it unselfishly, and then tested him
                      concerning its use.

 THINK IT THROUGH         In what ways is God testing me? Are there tests in my
                      life that I have not recognized before as tests?

             part 1 Read John 3:16.
 GOD'S CHARACTER         In this verse Jesus spoke of God as One who loved and
         John 3:16   gave. God's love is expressed through giving. The Son gave
                     Himself for man even before man had been created. See Rev.
                     13:8. He gave from principle.
                         "Turning from all lesser representations, we behold God in
                     Jesus. Looking unto Jesus we see that it is the glory of our
                     God to give. 'I do nothing of Myself,' said Christ; 'the living
                     Father hath sent Me, and I live by the Father.' I seek not Mine
                     own glory,' but the glory of Him that sent Me. John 8:28; 6:57;
                     8:50; 7:18. In these words is set forth the great principle which
                     is the law of life for the universe. All things Christ received
                     from God, but He took to give. So in the heavenly courts, in
                     His ministry for all created beings: through the beloved Son,
                     the Father's life flows out to all; through the Son it returns, in
                     praise and joyous service, a tide of love, to the great Source
                     of all. And thus through Christ the circuit of beneficence is
                     complete, representing the character of the great Giver, the
                     law of life."—The Desire of Ages, page 21.
                         Love expressed in self-sacrificial giving is the divine char-
                     acteristic that God is seeking to develop in man.
                         God demonstrated to the universe how far He was willing to
                     go, how much He was willing to give, to redeem and save man.
                     "Through Jesus, God's mercy was manifested to men; but
                     mercy does not set aside justice. The law reveals the attributes
                     of God's character, and not a jot or tittle of it could be changed
                     to meet man in his fallen condition. God did not change His
                     law, but He sacrificed Himself, in Christ, for man's redemp-
                     tion."—The Desire of Ages, page 762.
                        For God to change the law would be for Him to change His
                     character, for the law is a transcript of His character. For God
                     to change character would mean that He was imperfect either
                     before or after the change.
                         But man is the one who is imperfect and in need of change.
                     Faith in God that leads to giving oneself to God, is the begin-
                     ning point for the development of God's character in man.
 THINK IT THROUGH       What does it mean to give oneself to God?
                         "But Christ, coming to the earth as man, lived a holy life,
                     and developed a perfect character. These he offers as a free
                     gift to all who will receive them. His life stands for the life of
                     men. Thus they have remission of sins that are past, through
                     the forbearance of God. More than this, Christ imbues men with
                     the attributes of God. He builds up the human character after
                     the similitude of the divine character."—The Desire of Ages,

           Part 2      What is the believer's relation to God?
    IMAGE OF GOD
        Gen. 1:26       "And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our
                    likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea,
                    and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all
                    the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon
                    the earth."


                        The expression "the image of God" has very broad implica-
                    tions. Notice Ellen G. White's comments on this term in the
                    following quotations:
                        "God created man a superior being; he alone is formed in
                    the image of God, and is capable of partaking of the divine
                    nature, of cooperating with his Creator and executing His
                    plans."—Sons and Daughters of God, page 7.
                        "Man was to bear God's image, both in outward resemblance
                    and in character. Christ alone is 'the express image' (Hebrews
                    1:3) of the Father; but man was formed in the likeness of God.
                    His nature was in harmony with the will of God. His mind was
                    capable of comprehending divine things. His affections were
                    pure; his appetites and passions were under the control of
                    reason. He was holy and happy in bearing the image of God
                     and in perfect obedience to His will."—Patriarchs and Proph-
                    ets, page 45.
                        "And God's character was reflected in the character of
                     Adam. His glory was revealed in every object of nature."—The
                    Adventist Home, page 27.
                        "Sin has marred and well-nigh obliterated the image of God
                     in man. It was to restore this that the plan of salvation was
                     devised, and a life of probation was granted to man. To bring
                     him back to the perfection in which he was first created is the
                     great object of life—the object that underlies every other. . . .

 THINK IT THROUGH      How can I best cooperate with Jesus for the restoration of
                    the image of God in me?


                       "Satan Was exulting that he had succeeded in debasing the
                    image of God in humanity. Then Jesus came to restore in man
                    the image of his Maker. None but Christ can fashion anew the
                    character that has been ruined by sin. He came to expel the
                    demons that had controlled the will. He came to lift us up from
                    the dust, to reshape the marred character after the pattern of
                    His divine character, and to make it beautiful with His own
                    glory."—The Desire of Ages, pages 37, 38.

                            God's plan for character development involves the rejec-
                        tion of a "getting," self-serving life and the acceptance of a
                        "giving," self-sacrificing life motivated by faith in and love for
                        Jesus Christ.
                            "But Christ has given us no assurance that to attain per-

                        noble character is earned by individual effort through the merits
                        and grace of Christ. God gives the talents, the powers of the
                        mind; we form character. It is formed by hard, stern battles with
                        self. Conflict after conflict must be waged against hereditary
                        tendencies. We shall have to criticize ourselves closely, and
                        allow not one unfavorable trait to remain uncorrected."—

                        through Jesus? Eph. 2:10.
                            God seeks to involve man as His co-worker. This is essen-
                        tial for the development of character. "Not even God can make
                        our characters noble or our lives useful, unless we become co-

                        the poor and to advance His cause. By its necessities a ruined

    AND GIVING, I      "For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set
        Titus 1:5   in order the things that are wanting."

                       Paul sent Titus to "complete the work of organizing the
                    Cretan church. Perhaps because the Cretans may have thought
                    no additional organization necessary after Paul's departure,
                    Titus stood in need of this special authorization in order to
                    perfect an efficient organization."—SDA Bible Commentary, on
                    Titus 1:5.
                       One of the purposes of our denominational structure is to
                    educate people in giving their whole being to God. Making God
                    the center of one's life is the whole crux of character develop-
                    ment. Plans which provide members ways by which to give
                    their time, abilities, and possessions to God's work are devel-
                    oped by the church. The local church elects leaders in each
                    department for the very purpose of encouraging members to
                    give themselves in a service of love for those whom they can
                    help within the church and the community. Pastors are the
                    spiritual leaders, but each pastor can give only as one person.
                    He is to lead in giving and thus provide an example to the flock
                    to follow him to the extent that he follows Jesus.
                        "Objects that call benevolence into action must be placed
                    before them, or they cannot pattern after the character of the

                       Elders led out in the spiritual work of each congregation in
                    the early church. In our church we still follow this plan, and
                    Ellen G. White has counseled that: "The elders and those who
                    have leading places in the church should give more thought
                    to their plans for conducting the work. They should arrange
                    matters so that every member of the church shall have a part
                    to act, that none may lead an aimless life, but that all may
                    accomplish what they can according to their several ability."

          Eph. 5:27    be holy and without blemish."

                           The spots, wrinkles, and blemishes are, at their root, the
                       results of selfishness. The glory and holiness of the church is
                       the self-sacrificing character of Jesus reproduced in the mem-
                        bers of the church. Self-sacrificial giving by church members
                        does not purchase salvation, but it is an outgrowth of faith in
                       Jesus. The Christian who gives is working in cooperation with
                       his Saviour.
                           Conversion is the first need of every person. The self must

                       has sanctified ability to work for others. Further, worldliness is

                       tiveness of the church's witness, but it is a negative influence
                       in the church that prevents the conversion of others. "The Lord
                       does not now work to bring many souls into the truth, because

                          To be effective, spiritual plans should be so carefully laid
                       and implemented that each member will not only have oppor-

            Part 6      Read 1 John 3:2.
       THE WHOLE         This verse looks forward to the full restoration of the image
         LIFE GIFT   of God in man. The image of God was diminished in man as a
        1 John 3:2   result of sins, and sin changed man's view of himself from that
                     of a steward caring for God's goods to that of an owner han-
                     dling his own possessions. The restoration of God's image in
                     man reverses this view he has of himself so that he recognizes
                     himself as a steward who is managing the property of the Great
                     Owner. The property includes his whole life and its assets.
                     Godly character is developed as the believer views life and its
                     assets as belonging to God and uses them in the way he rec-
                     ognizes that God would use them, were He dealing with them
                     directly.
                         Ellen G. White identifies some of these assets as follows:
                         1. The Body. "The body is a most important medium through
                     which the mind and the soul are developed for the upbuilding
                     of character. Hence it is that the adversary of souls directs his
                     temptations to the enfeebling and degrading of the physical
                     powers. His success here often means the surrender of the
                     whole being to evil."—Prophets and Kings, pages 488, 489.
                         "But those who are slaves to appetite will fail in perfecting
                     Christian character."—Testimonies, Vol. 3, p. 492.
                         2. Material Possessions. "It was not God's purpose that pov-
                     erty should wholly cease. It is one of His means for the develop-
                     ment of character."—The Ministry of Healing, page 186. "This
                     tithing system, I saw, would develop character, and manifest
                     the true state of the heart."—Testimonies, Vol. 1, p. 237.
                         3. Abilities. "He desires each child of His to build a noble
                     character, by the doing of pure, noble deeds. . . .
                         "It is only by the right use of the talents that the character
                     can develop harmoniously."—Child Guidance, page 166.
                         4. Time. "The only way in which we can redeem our time is
                     by making the most of that which remains, by being co-workers
                     with God in His great plan of redemption."—Christ's Object
                     Lessons, page 342.
                        What does the hope of seeing Jesus and of being like Him
                     cause a person to do? 1 John 3:3.

                        "To restore in man the image of his Maker, to bring him
                     back to the perfection in which he was created, to promote the
                     development of body, mind, and soul, that the divine purpose
                     in His creation might be realized—this was to be the work of

      FOR GIVING    cause that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that
       1 John 4:9   we might live through him."
                        We often consider the gift of Jesus Christ at Calvary as the
                    first great sign of God's love, but the creation of this world
                    was also a demonstration of His great love. "This world was
                    established and is sustained by the compassionate love of the
                    Creator."—Testimonies, Vol. 9, p. 50.
                        "All created things testify to His power, His wisdom, His
                    love."—Testimonies, Vol. 8, p. 265.
                       What was God's motive for giving His Son? John 3:16.

                         Here is the example for each of us to follow. The only motive
                    for giving which is acceptable to God is the motive He Himself
                    has—love.
                         "As Christ in His expiring agony upon the cross cried out,
                    'It is finished' (John 19:30), a shout of triumph rang through
                    every world and through heaven itself. The great contest that
                    had been so long in progress in this world was now decided,
                    and Christ was conqueror. His death had answered the ques-
                    tion whether the Father and the Son had sufficient love for man
                    to exercise self-denial and a spirit of sacrifice. Satan had
                    revealed his true character as a liar and a murderer. It was
                    seen that the very same spirit with which he had ruled the

                    manifested if permitted to control the intelligences of heaven.

                         God gave because He "so loved the world." No other reason
                    is given. No.other reason is needed. No other reason is valid.

 THINK IT THROUGH      How should I respond to God's love?

                        "Could God give us any greater proof of His love than in
                    thus giving His Son to pass through this scene of suffering?
                    And as the gift of God to man was a free gift, His love infinite,
                    so His claims upon our confidence, our obedience, our whole
                    heart, and the wealth of our affections, are correspondingly
                    infinite. He requires all that it is possible for man to give. The
                    submission on our part must be proportionate to the gift of
                    God; it must be complete and wanting in nothing. We are all
                    debtors to God. He has claims upon us that we cannot meet
                    without giving ourselves a full and willing sacrifice."—Testi-

             Part 2      "Thus He taught that the value of the gift is estimated not
      MAN'S MOTIVE    by the amount, but by the proportion that is given and the
                      motive that actuates the giver."—The Acts of the Apostles,
        FOR GIVING    page 342.
        Luke 21:1-4
                          "And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their
                      gifts into the treasury. And he saw also a certain poor widow
                      casting in thither two mites. And he said, Of a truth I say
                      unto you, that this poor widow hath cast in more than they
                      all: for all these have of their abundance cast in unto the
                      offerings of God: but she of her penury bath cast in all the
                      living that she had."
                         "It is the motive that gives character to our acts, stamping
                      them with ignominy or with high moral worth. Not the great
                      things which every eye sees and every tongue praises does
                      God account most precious. The little duties cheerfully done,
                      the little gifts which make no show, and which to human eyes
                      may appear worthless, often stand highest in His sight. A heart
                      of faith and love is dearer to God than the most costly gift.
                      The poor widow gave her living to do the little that she did. She
                      deprived herself of food in order to give those two mites to the
                      cause she loved. And she did it in faith, believing that her
                      heavenly Father would not overlook her great need. It was this
                      unselfish spirit and childlike faith that won the Saviour's com-
                      mendation."—The Desire of Ages, page 615.
                         What attitudes did Paul commend to Corinthian believers
                      who were giving offerings for the Jerusalem saints? 2 Cor.
                      9:7.
                         "God will have a free-will offering. Those who give must
                      esteem it a privilege to do so."—Spiritual Gifts, Vol. 2, p. 249.
                         "Every action derives its quality from the motive which
                      prompts it, and if the motives are not high, and pure, and
                      unselfish, the mind and character will never become well bal-
                      anced."—Sons and Daughters of God, page 171.

 THINK IT THROUGH        If I followed the principle of giving taught by the story of
                      the widow's mite, how much would I give?
                          "When Christ abides in the soul, the thought of reward is not
                      uppermost. This is not the motive that actuates our service.
                      It is true that in a subordinate sense we should have respect
                      to the recompense of reward. God desires us to appreciate
                      His promised blessings. . . . We should not be so anxious to
                      gain the reward as to do what is right, irrespective of all gain.
                      Love to God and to our fellow men should be our motive."—

The Motive for Giving LESSON 4                                           ❑ Tuesday
                                                                         October 23

            Part 3       What was the attitude of the Macedonian believers toward
     APPEALS FOR      giving for relief of the Christians in Jerusalem?
           GIVING         "Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the
      2 Cor. 8:4, 5   gift, and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the
                      saints. And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their
                      own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God."

                          "God designs that the exercise of benevolence shall be
                      purely voluntary, not having recourse even to eloquent appeals
                      to excite sympathy. 'God loveth a cheerful giver.' He is not
                      pleased to have His treasury replenished with forced supplies."
                      —Testimonies, Vol. 3, p. 413.
                          "True Christian benevolence springs from the principle of
                      grateful love. Love to Christ cannot exist without corresponding
                      love to those whom He came into the world to redeem. Love
                      to Christ must be the ruling principle of the being, controlling
                      all the emotions and directing all the energies. Redeeming love
                      should awaken all the tender affection and self-sacrificing devo-
                      tion that can possibly exist in the heart of man. When this is
                      the case, no heart-stirring appeals will be needed to break
                      through their selfishness and awaken their dormant sympathies,
                      to call forth benevolent offerings for the precious cause of
                      truth."—Testimonies, Vol. 3, p. 396.

                         What has Jesus promised will be the result of giving?
                      Luke 6:38.

                         Give what God has enabled you to give. It isn't necessary
                      to wait for an appeal. Give when you see a need either in God's
                      work or among your fellowmen. Give what you have. Jesus has
                      given us all that we have. "Freely ye have received, freely
                      give." Matt. 10:8.

 THINK IT THROUGH        What has been my past response to the needs of God's
                      work and to the needs of my fellowmen? What changes should
                      I make?

                         "There may sometimes have been too much urging for
                      means. But when the light and love of Jesus illuminates the
                      hearts of His followers, there will be no occasion for urging or
                      begging their money or their service. When they become one
                      with Jesus, and realize that they are not their own, that they
                      are bought with a price and are therefore the Lord's property,
                      and that all they have is simply entrusted to them as His stew-
                      ards, they will with cheerful heart and unswerving fidelity
                      render to God the things that are His."—Testimonies, Vol. 5,

              Part 4       What are the modern equivalents of the unacceptable
     UNACCEPTABLE       offerings given by some Jews in postexilic Judah?
          OFFERINGS
     Mal. 1:8, 13, 14       "And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and
                        if ye offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? offer it now unto
                        thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy per-
                        son? saith the Lord of hosts."


                           "Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness is it! and ye have
                        snuffed at it, saith the Lord of hosts; and ye brought that
                        which was torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye brought
                        an offering: should I accept this of your hand? saith the Lord.
                        But cursed be the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and
                        voweth, and sacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing: for I am
                        a great King, saith the lord of hosts, and my name is dreadful
                        among the heathen."


                            God does not accept an unwilling offering as a gift at all. It
                        may be used in His work, but the blessing that could come to
                        the giver of the offering is not granted. To the giver it is as
                        though the offering were never given. The formality of the offer-
                        ing is carried out, but the heart is not in the gift. The grudging
                        gift is given from some other motive than love. The seriousness
                        of this type of an experience is that the time comes when a
                        person no longer distinguishes the good motive from the bad
                        motive even though the giving of offerings continues.
                            "The Lord will not accept an offering that is made unwill-
                        ingly, grudgingly. With your present feelings there would be no
                        virtue in making more pledges. When you recover from this
                        snare of the enemy, when you heal the breach that you have
                        made, and realize that the wants of God's cause are as con-
                        tinual as are His gifts to the children of men, your works will
                        correspond with your faith, and you will receive a rich blessing
                        from the Lord."—Testimonies, Vol. 5, p. 285.


 THINK IT THROUGH          What is my motive for giving my life to Christ?


                           "We do not propose to appeal to the lust of the appetite or
                        resort to carnal amusements as an inducement to Christ's
                        professed followers to give of the means which God has en-
                        trusted to them. If they do not give willingly, for the love of
                        Christ, the offering will in no case be acceptable to God."

The Motive for Giving LESSON 4                                        ❑ Thursday
                                                                         October 25


          Part 5       To what degree of maturity is the church to attain?
       MATURITY
      AND GIVING      "Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the
                    knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the
        Eph. 4:13
                    measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ."

                        The church, as well as the individual, is to come to maturity.
                    To refuse to mature or "grow up" is a greater sin than the
                    immaturity, and is an outcome of self-satisfaction and low
                    ideals. The call for unity and maturity of verse 13 is contrasted
                    with the immaturity and disunity of verse 14.
                        Immaturity in the church is encouraged by appealing to the
                    wrong motives for giving to Christ. Candy sales, bake sales,
                    fairs, dinners, prizes for services performed for Christ, are a
                    few examples of appeals to wrong motives for giving. The
                    mature Christian needs no gimmicks to encourage his liberality.
                        "Wherever there is life in a church, there is inc ease and
                    growth. There is also a constant interchange, taking and giv-
                    ing out, receiving and returning to the Lord His own. To every
                     true believer God imparts light and blessing, and this the be-
                     liever imparts to others in the work that he does for the Lord.
                     As he gives of that which he receives, his capacity for receiv-
                     ing is increased. Room is made for fresh supplies of grace and
                     truth. Clearer light, increased knowledge, are his. On this giving
                     and receiving depend the life and growth of the church. He
                     who receives, but never gives, soon ceases to receive. If the
                     truth does not flow from him to others, he loses his capacity
                     to receive. We must impart the goods of heaven, if we would
                     receive fresh blessing."—Counsels on Stewardship, page 36.


 THINK IT THROUGH      Why is it unsafe for me to rely on emotions and appeals
                    to determine when and how much to give?

                       "Here [2 Cor. 8:7] benevolence is placed by the side of faith,
                    love, and Christian diligence. Those who think that they can
                    be good Christians, and close their ears and hearts to the
                    calls of God for their liberalities, are in a fearful deception.
                    There are those who abound in professions of great love for
                    the truth, and, so far as words are concerned, have an interest
                    to see the truth advance, but who do nothing for its advance-
                    ment. The faith of such is dead, not being made perfect by
                    works. The Lord never made such a mistake as to convert a
                    soul and leave it under the power of covetousness."—Testi-

The Motive for Giving LESSON 4                                            ❑ Friday
                                                                          October 26

           Part 6        What was Christ's example of initiative in giving?
 LOVE VOLUNTEERS        "Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down
    John 10:17, 18    my life, that I might take it again. No man taketh it from
                      me, but I lay it down of myself."

                          Love volunteers. Love makes a gift of itself. It is open, ex-
                      pansive, and receptive; not closed and narrowed by self-inter-
                      ests.
                          Regardless of the urgency of the need, its importance or
                      merit, the basic motive for giving is love. Love is impartial.
                      Jesus gave Himself. His gift was not for any special class or
                      group. Whosoever will may receive Him. He will satisfy the
                      needs of the life, regardless of the amount needed or who and
                      where it is. This is the example we are to follow.
                          Jesus is the author and finisher of our faith. He gave with

                          "To give or to labor when our sympathies are moved, and
                      to withhold our gifts or service when the emotions are not
                      stirred, is an unwise and dangerous course. If we are con-
                      trolled by impulse or mere human sympathy, then a few in-
                      stances where our efforts for others are repaid with ingratitude,
                      or where our gifts are abused or squandered, will be sufficient
                      to freeze up the springs of beneficence. Christians should act
                      from fixed principle, following the Saviour's example of self-

        John 5:42-44   seek not the honour that cometh from God only?"
                           These verses set forth the difference between Jesus and
                        the Jews who were opposing Him. Jesus' life was centered in
                        God. His opponents could not understand that kind of life, for
                        their lives were centered in themselves. Their lives ministered
                        to their own glory instead of to God's glory, and they thus
                        put themselves in God's place in their experience. They were
                        idolators, and self was their god. Thus it is with all who live
                        self-centered, or selfish, lives. They are guilty of self-idolatry.
                           "The law of love calls for the devotion of body, mind, and
                        soul to the service of God and our fellow men. And this service,
                        while making us a blessing to others, brings the greatest bless-
                        ing to ourselves. Unselfishness underlies all true development.
                        Through unselfish service we receive the highest culture of
                        every faculty. More and more fully do we become partakers
                       of the divine nature. We are fitted for heaven, for we receive
                       heaven into our hearts."—Education, page 16.

                        ciple that Satan hates; its very existence he denies. From the
                        beginning of the great controversy he has endeavored to prove
                        God's principles of action to be selfish, and he deals in the
                       same way with all who serve God. To disprove Satan's claim
                       is the work of Christ and of all who bear His name.
                           "It was to give in His own life an illustration of unselfishness
                       that Jesus came in the form of humanity. And all who accept

      RESULTS OF     ing text?
   SELF ATTITUDES       "I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and
      John 5:30-32   my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but
                     the will of the Father which hath sent me. If I bear witness of
                     myself, my witness is not true. There is another that beareth
                     witness of me; and I know that the witness which he wit-
                     nesseth of me is true."
                         Jesus' life on earth was a lesson in self-denial. His selfless
                     life was a continual demonstration of the principle of love in
                     action. He withheld nothing. He did only the will of His Father
                     and sought only the Father's glory or reputation.
                         Selfishness causes a person to withhold from God what is
                     rightfully His. Selfishness is at the root of unfaithful steward-
                     ship in all areas of life. It causes a person to deceive himself
                     and to attempt to deceive God. Such a person wishes it to
                     appear as though his life has been given to God.
                        Explain the relation of selfishness and deceit in the ex-
                     perience of Ananias and Sapphira. Acts 5:3.

                        Consider what selfishness does to man:
                        1. "It is earthliness and selfishness that separate from
                     God."—Testimonies, Vol. 5, p. 254.
                         2. "It is selfishness that causes variance in the family circle
                     and in the church."—Testimonies, Vol. 4, p. 610.
                        3. "Selfishness and love of display have been corrupting
                     the heart and deteriorating the character."—Testimonies, Vol.
                     4, p. 638.
                         4. "It is vain for others to seek to please you, for you could
                     not please yourself, even if all your wishes were indulged. You
                     are a capricious child and have become sick of yourself through

                     the characters of the people were plainly developed. Those
                     who placed a high value upon the blessings which God be-
                     stowed upon them brought offerings in accordance with this
                     appreciation of His blessings. Those whose moral powers were
                     stupefied and benumbed by selfishness and idolatrous love of
                     the favors received, rather than inspired by fervent love for

     AND THE CHURCH
            Rev. 3:11       God counsels the church, in verse 18, to look away from
                         self and to look to Him. He is here speaking to a church which
                         is deceiving itself. It does not realize that it is wretched, miser-
                        able, blind, and naked. Selfishness has affected the under-
                        standing so severely as to be compared with being unaware of
                        the loss of possessions, sight, and clothing.
                            "The sin that is most nearly hopeless and incurable is pride
                        of opinion, self-conceit. This stands in the way of all growth."
                        —Testimonies, Vol. 7, pp. 199, 200.
                            Selfishness causes the church to feel self-sufficient, having
                        great profession but with little vital godliness and true piety.
                        Consider what selfishness does to the church.
                            1. "Selfishness is driving benevolence and the love of Christ
                        from the church."—Testimonies, Vol. 5, p. 205.
                            2. "It is this increasing devotion to money getting, the sel-
                        fishness which the desire for gain begets, that removes the
                        favor of God from the church and deadens its spirituality."—
                        Testimonies, Vol. 4, p. 82.
                            3. "Selfishness has brought discord into the church, filling
                        it with unholy ambition."—Counsels on Stewardship, page 24.
                           What, in the following reference, indicates the nature of
                        the straying sheep? Isa. 53:6.

                           Sheep who follow self, or go their "own way," are heading
                        for trouble. Unity, direction, and purpose are the results of
                        following the shepherd. Today the lost people of the world
                        need to see a "selfless" flock which they can join and accom-

                    forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit."
                        The fruits of selfishness are not always visible to the selfish
                    individual. Selfishness may seem to be sweet and satisfying in
                    its early stages. However, as it grows and ripens, it bears a
                    fruit which is unsavory. It is a poison which destroys character.

                    52. Life is taken up with self. There is no room for the Holy
                    Spirit to dwell in the life. It is the Holy Spirit which adds power
                    to the life and the gospel. "Nothing saps spirituality from the
                    soul more quickly than to enclose it in selfishness and self-

                     rance, and understands and helps us in our manifold necessi-
                     ties. But the mind must be constantly going out after God. If
                    coldness and worldliness are allowed to come in, we shall have
                     no heart to pray, no courage to look up to Him who is the
                    source of strength and wisdom. Then pray always, dear
                     brethren and sisters, 'lifting up holy hands, without wrath and
                     doubting.' Urge your requests to the throne of grace, and rely
                     upon God hour by hour and moment by moment. The service
                     of Christ will regulate all your relations with your fellow men

             Part 5      What condition developed among the returnees from Baby-
        COLLECTIVE    lon as a result of selfish neglect of God's house?
       SELFISHNESS       "Ye looked for much, and, lo, it came to little; and when
         Haggai 1:9   ye brought it home, I did blow upon it. Why? saith the Lord
                      of hosts. Because of mine house that is waste, and ye run
                      every man unto his own house."

                          The experience related in this text was a collective selfish-
                       ness. The Jews neglected to rebuild the temple while they
                       built houses for themselves.
                          Two common forms of collective selfishness are seen when
                       the members of a local church (1) refrain from adequately
                       supporting God's work in their local church and community, or,
                      (2) withhold their support from needs beyond their immediate
                      area of personal interest.
                          "Every soul united to Christ will be a living missionary to
                      all around him. He will labor for those near and those afar
                      off. He will have no sectional feeling, no interest merely to
                       build up one branch of the work over which he presides and
                       there let his zeal end. All will work with interest to make every
                      branch strong. There will be no self-love, no selfish interest.
                      The cause is one, the truth a great whole.
                          "Well may the question be asked with earnest, anxious
                      heart, 'Is envy cherished, is jealousy permitted to find a place
                      in my heart?' If so, Christ is not there. 'Do I love the law of
                      God, is the love of Jesus Christ in my heart?' If we love one
                      another as Christ has loved us then we are getting ready for
                       the blessed heaven of peace and rest. There is no struggling
                      there to be first, to have the supremacy; all will love their
                      neighbor as themselves. Oh, that God would open the under-
                      standing and speak to the hearts of our churches by arousing
                      the individual members."—Selected Messages, Bk. 2, pp. 381,
                      382.
                          When a church refuses to assume its responsibilities within
                      the worldwide organization, it is setting an example to each
                      local member to refuse to assume individual responsibility to
                      the local church. The church cannot expect loyalty from its
                      members for part of its local program when it is not loyal to
                      its obligations for the worldwide work of the church.

 THINK IT THROUGH        In what ways am I contributing to collective selfishness or
                      unselfishness in my church?

                         "Selfishness, the sin of the world, has become the prevailing

         Gal 2:20    The conquest over the sinful self Paul describes as a cru-
                    cifixion, and the subsequent life he attributes to faith in Jesus.
                        "Human nature is ever struggling for expression, ready for
                    contest; but he who learns of Christ is emptied of self, of pride,
                    of love of supremacy, and there is silence in the soul. Self is
                    yielded to the disposal of the Holy Spirit. Then we are not
                    anxious to have the highest place. We have no ambition to
                    crowd and elbow ourselves into notice; but we feel that our
                    highest place is at the feet of our Saviour. We look to Jesus,
                    waiting for His hand to lead, listening for His voice to guide."

                    ness in our lives. The greatest work that can be done in our
                    world is to glorify God by living the character of Christ. God
                    will make perfect only those who will die to self. Those who
                    are willing to do this can say, 'I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth

                    "Paul's sanctification was the result of a constant conflict with
                    self. He said: 'I die daily.' 1 Corinthians 15:31. His will and his
                    desires every day conflicted with duty and the will of God.
                    Instead of following inclination, he did God's will, however

          Part 1       What reason did Jesus give for His warning against cove-
     PURPOSE OF     tousness?
     SYSTEMATIC        "And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of cove-
    BENEVOLENCE     tousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of
      Luke 12:15    the things which he possesseth."
                       Systematic benevolence is designed to combat covetousness
                    by encouraging believers to give as frequently as they receive
                    increase. The abundance of possessions is not always a bless-
                    ing to the owner. The mind may become so occupied in caring
                    for or seeking to increase one's holdings, or in buying to satisfy
                    one's desires, that God is left out of the thoughts. The constant
                    attention to my holdings and desires makes a self-centered
                    situation that produces a selfish character. By diverting one's
                    thoughts and means to the needs of God's cause and the needs
                    of one's fellowmen, the self-centeredness is broken up and a
                    new center is formed in God.
                       Dissatisfaction with what we are or have, the desire for more,
                    leads us either to want more things or to seek the real reason
                    for our dissatisfaction. God encourages us to seek Him who
                    will bring satisfaction, purpose, and meaning to life.
                        "The system of benevolence was arranged to prevent that
                    great evil, covetousness. Christ saw that in the prosecution of
                    business the love of riches would be the greatest cause of
                    rooting true godliness out of the heart. He saw that the love
                    of money would freeze deep and hard into men's souls, stop-
                    ping the flow of generous impulses and closing their senses to
                    the wants of the suffering and the afflicted."—Testimonies,
                    Vol. 3, p. 547.
                        The idea of systematic giving also sharpens recognition of
                    the constancy of the needs of the church and the world. These
                    needs are as constant as my needs. The provision for God's
                    work should be as frequent as my provision for myself.
                       What reason did David give for asking the question about
                    why he and his people were able to offer so willingly to God?
                    1 Chron. 29:14.

 THINK IT THROUGH     Is the principle of systematic benevolence limited to
                    money? Or how else might it be applied?
                        "He has ordained that giving should become a habit, that
                    it may counteract the dangerous and deceitful sin of covetous-
                    ness. Continual giving starves covetousness to death. Syste-
                    matic benevolence is designed in the order of God to tear away
                    treasures from the covetous as fast as they are gained and to
                    consecrate them to the Lord, to whom they belong."—Testi-

             Part 2       What admonition does Paul give to those who are "rich in
A BLESSING TO MAN     this world"?
     1 Tim. 6:16,19      "That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready
                      to distribute, willing to communicate; laying up in store for
                      themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that
                      they may lay hold on eternal life."

                         An important objective of systematic benevolence is to help
                      the believer in the development of Christian character. "God
                      planned the system of beneficence, in order that man might
                      become like his Creator, benevolent and unselfish in character,
                      and finally be a partaker with Christ in the eternal, glorious
                      reward."—Counsels on Stewardship, page 15. Systematic giv-
                      ing is a blessing to you and a blessing to your fellowmen.

                         What was Paul's attitude toward the Corinthian believers?
                      2 Cor. 12:15.
                          God cannot save a person who gives only a fraction of his
                      life to Him. He is seeking to develop the whole man.
                          "God's providence has arranged the entire plan of syste-
                      matic benevolence for the benefit of man. His providence never
                      stands still. If God's servants follow His opening providence,
                      all will be active workers."—Testimonies, Vol. 3, p. 399. Paul's
                      life was a living demonstration of continual giving. He even
                      welcomed death as the fulfillment of service.

 THINK IT THROUGH        In what ways have I been blessed as a result of faithful-
                      ness in giving systematically?
                         "I saw that in the arrangement of systematic benevolence,
                      hearts will be tested and proved. It is a constant, living test. It
                      brings one to understand his own heart, to see whether the
                      truth or the love of the world predominates. Here is a test for
                      the naturally selfish and covetous. They will put down their
                      possessions at very low figures."—Testimonies, Vol. 1, p. 221.
                         Note: This last sentence refers to the plan recommended in
                      Adventist papers in the early 1860's of making contributions to
                      the cause on property holdings, as well as income, as though
                      these properties increased in value at a rate of 10 percent
                      annually, the going rate for money in savings accounts. See

Systematic Benevolence         LESSON 6                                   ❑ Tuesday
                                                                          November 6

            Part 3      What principle of giving did Jesus emphasize?
       A BLESSING       "Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure,
   TO THE CHURCH     pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall
         Luke 6:38   men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that
                     ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again."

                          Here Jesus lays down a principle which holds true whether
                     it be judging another or giving an offering. We receive as we
                     have given.
                          Jesus is seeking to develop a church that gives liberally
                     of what it has for the purposes of God. A church that is giving
                     the most is receiving the most from God. "Those churches who
                     are the most systematic and liberal in sustaining the cause of
                     God are the most prosperous spiritually. True liberality in the
                     follower of Christ identifies his interest with that of His Master."
                     —Testimonies, Vol. 3, p. 405. Working churches are spiritually
                     strong. A body that does not follow God's instructions for
                     healthful living is weaker than one that does, and a working,
                     giving, sharing church is much stronger than one that refuses
                     to give.
                          "The spiritual health and prosperity of the church is de-
                     pendent in a great degree upon her systematic benevolence.
                      It is like the lifeblood which must flow through the whole
                      being, vitalizing every member of the body. It increases love
                     for the souls of our fellow men; for by self-denial and self-
                     sacrifice we are brought into a closer relationship to Christ,
                      who for our sakes became poor."—Testimonies, Vol. 3, p. 405.

 THINK IT THROUGH        What blessings can I recognize in my church as the result
                     of our members' faithfulness?

                        "God is leading His people in the plan of systematic benev-
                     olence, and this is one of the very points to which God is
                     bringing up His people which will cut the closest with some."
                     —Testimonies, Vol. 1, p. 191.
                        "Every true Christian will develop in his life the charac-
                     teristics of this divine love; he will reveal a spirit of forbear-
                     ance, of beneficence, and a freedom from envy and jealousy.
                     This character developed in word and act will not repulse, and
                     will not be unapproachable, cold, and indifferent to the inter-
                     ests of others. The person who cultivates the precious plant
                     of love will be self-denying in spirit, and will not yield self-
                     control even under provocation. He will not impute wrong mo-
                     tives and evil intentions to others, but will feel deeply over sin
                     when discovered in any of the disciples of Christ."—Testi-

Systematic Benevolence          LESSON 6                              ❑   Wednesday
                                                                          November 7

            Part 4       What does Rev. 13:8 imply as to the time when the plan
         NO CALLS     of salvation was formed?
        NECESSARY
          Rev. 13:8      "And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him,
                      whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb
                      slain from the foundation of the world."

                          God provided salvation for us before we existed. If we come
                      as close as we can to following the example of God in our
                      salvation, we shall give for His cause even before the need is
                      apparent for which our gift will eventually be used.
                          "God has devised a plan by which all may give as He has
                      prospered them, and which will make giving a habit without
                      waiting for special calls. Those who can do this, but will not
                      because of their selfishness, are robbing their Creator, who has
                      bestowed upon them means to invest in His cause to advance
                      its interest."—Testimonies, Vol. 3, p. 411.
                          The apparent necessity for appeals for funds in church is an
                      affront to God. It is offensive to visitors and detracts from the
                      spirit of worship. From where, then, will the church receive
                      the means needed to carry on the work? From following God's
                      plan of systematic benevolence in returning to Him His own.
                          God has made full provision for His work. He has given ex-
                      plicit instructions which He asks His leaders to carry out.
                      "Ministers have neglected to enforce gospel beneficence. The
                      subject of tithes and offerings has not been dwelt upon as it
                      should have been."—Testimonies, Vol. 5, p. 382.
                          Not upon the minister alone rests the responsibility of kindly
                      explaining God's plans, and their spiritual and financial mean-
                      ing and possibilities. He is to be assisted by those elected to
                      serve with him. "Let the elders and officers of the church follow
                      the direction of the Sacred Word, and urge upon their members
                      the necessity of faithfulness in the payment of pledges, tithes,
                      and offerings."—Counsels on Stewardship, page 107.

                        Under what circumstances did Jesus give His life for us?
                      Rom. 5:6-8.

 THINK IT THROUGH        How spontaneous are my gifts for God's work?

                         "Greater effort should be put forth by responsible men in
                      the different churches to have all follow the plan of God's
                      arrangement. If systematic benevolence is carried out, the ur-
                      gent calls at the camp meetings for means for various enter-
                      prises will not be necessary."—Testimonies, Vol. 3, p. 411.

Systematic Benevolence       LESSON 6                                ❑  Thursday
                                                                      November 8

           Part 5      What evil resulted from Judah's delinquency in benevo-
      RESULTS IF    lence?
      NEGLECTED        "And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not
    Neh. 13:10-12   been given them: for the Levites and the singers, that did the
                    work, were fled every one to his field. Then contended I with
                    the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken?
                    And I gathered them together, and set them in their place.
                    Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new
                    wine and the oil unto the treasuries."

                       This experience of Nehemiah and the people of Judah brings
                    into focus a searching question that could be asked today
                    wherever the work of God languishes: "Why is the house of
                    God forsaken?" One of the most serious neglects by a person,
                    family, church, or conference is the neglect to provide for
                    God's work.
                       Is it still true today as it was in the 1860's that "there has
                    been a neglect in the churches of keeping up the plan of sys-
                    tematic benevolence, and the result has been an impoverished
                    treasury and a backslidden church"?—Testimonies, Vol. 3,
                    p. 409.
                        "Self-surrender is the substance of the teachings of Christ.
                    Often it is presented and enjoined in language that seems
                    authoritative, because there is no other way to save man than
                    to cut away those things which, if entertained, will demoralize
                    the whole being.
                        "When Christ's followers give back to the Lord His own,
                    they are accumulating treasure which will be given to them
                     when they shall hear the words, 'Well done, good and faithful
                     servant; .. . enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.' "—The Desire
                    of Ages, page 523.

 THINK IT THROUGH      What reasons are there for my increased faithfulness in
                    stewardship?
                       "Whenever God's people, in any period of the world, have
                    cheerfully and willingly carried out His plan in systematic
                    benevolence and in gifts and offerings, they have realized the
                    standing promise that prosperity should attend all their labors
                    just in proportion as they obeyed His requirements. When they
                    acknowledged the claims of God and complied with His re-
                    quirements, honoring Him with their substance, their barns
                    were filled with plenty. But when they robbed God in tithes
                    and in offerings they were made to realize that they were not
                    only robbing Him but themselves, for He limited His blessings
                    to them just in proportion as they limited their offerings to
                    Him."—Testimonies, Vol. 3, p. 395.

Systematic Benevolence            LESSON 6                                   ❑ Friday
                                                                            November 9

               Part 6      What instruction did God give to Israel for the three annual
     GOD'S OWN PLAN     convocations?
          Deut. 16:17      "Every man shall give as he is able, according to the bless-
                        ing of the Lord thy God which he hath given thee."

                            The plan that God established was fair. Gifts to Him were
                        to be determined by the giver's prosperity, and the giver was
                        the one who determined what he was able to give.
                            "Anciently the Lord instructed His people to assemble three
                        times a year for His worship. To these holy convocations the
                        children of Israel came, bringing to the house of God their
                        tithes, their sin offerings, and their offerings of gratitude. They
                        met to recount God's mercies, to make known His wonderful
                        works, and to offer praise and thanksgiving to His name. And
                        they were to unite in the sacrificial service which pointed to
                        Christ as the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the
                        world. Thus they were to be preserved from the corrupting
                        power of worldliness and idolatry. Faith and love and gratitude
                        were to be kept alive in their hearts, and through their asso-
                        ciation together in this sacred service they were to be bound
                        closer to God and to one another."—Testimonies, Vol. 6, p. 39.
                            "The simplicity of the plan of systematic benevolence does
                        not detract from its merits, but extols the wisdom of God in
                        its arrangement. Everything bearing the divine stamp unites
                        simplicity with utility."—Testimonies, Vol. 3, p. 409.
                            "While in poverty, many regard systematic giving as a Bible
                        requirement; but when they come into possession of money
                        or property, they do not acknowledge God's claim upon them.
                        They look upon their means as their own."—Ellen G. White
                        Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 3, p. 1130. One needs
                        to consider seriously whether or not, and to what degree, he
                        has been affected by such reasoning.

                            "Our Redeemer, who knew man's danger in regard to cove-
                        tousness, has provided a safeguard against this dreadful evil.
                        He has arranged the plan of salvation so that it begins and
                        ends in benevolence. Christ offered Himself, an infinite sacri-
                        fice. This, in and of itself, bears directly against covetousness
                        and exalts benevolence.
                           "Constant, self-denying benevolence is God's remedy for
                        the cankering sins of selfishness and covetousness. God has
                        arranged systematic benevolence to sustain His cause and

                           "Paul presents his pattern, his ideal. Christ had given Him-

                       treasure. He would refresh their memories in regard to the
                       sacrifice made in their behalf. Christ was commander in the

                       He was rich, yet for our sakes, He became poor. It was not
                       spiritual riches that He left behind; He was always abounding
                       in the gifts of the Spirit. But He was of poor parentage. The
                       world never saw its Lord wealthy."—Ellen G. White Com-

                       as a representative of the human family. He identified Himself
                       with our interests, bared His breast for the stroke of death,
                       took man's guilt and its penalty, and offered in man's behalf
                       a complete sacrifice to God. By virtue of this atonement, He

                          Paul's reference to Christ's equality with the Father reminds

                       steps involved in this process:
                          1. Christ left His place and position in heaven.
                          2. He took upon Himself the form of a servant, or slave.
                          3. He did the will of His Father.

                     verses 12-15.
       John 13:3.5
                        "Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into
                     his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God;
                     he riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took
                     a towel, and girded himself. After that he poureth water into
                     a boson, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe
                     them with the towel wherewith he was girded."

                         "To those who receive the spirit of this service, it can never
                     become a mere ceremonial. Its constant lesson will be, 'By
                     love serve one another.' Gal. 5:13. In washing the feet of His
                     disciples, Christ gave evidence that He would do any service,
                     however humble, that would make them heirs with Him of the
                     eternal wealth of heaven's treasure. His disciples, in perform-
                     ing the same rite, pledge themselves in like manner to serve
                     their brethren. Whenever this ordinance is rightly celebrated,
                     the children of God are brought into a holy relationship, to
                     help and bless each other. They covenant that the life shall
                     be given to unselfish ministry. And this, not only for one an-
                     other. Their field of labor is as wide as their Master's was.
                     The world is full of those who need our ministry. The poor, the
                     helpless, the ignorant, are on every hand. Those who have
                     communed with Christ in the upper chamber will go forth to
                     minister as He did."—The Desire of Ages, page 651.
                         "The ordinance of feet washing is an ordinance of service.
                      This is the lesson the Lord would have all learn and practice.
                      When this ordinance is rightly celebrated, the children of God
                      are brought into holy relationship with each other, to help and
                      bless each other.
                          "That His people might not be misled by the selfishness
                      which dwells in the natural heart, and which strengthens by
                      self-serving, Christ Himself set us an example of humility. He
                      would not leave this great subject in man's charge. Of so
                      much consequence did He regard it that He Himself, One equal
                      with .God, washed the feet of His disciples [John 13:13-17
                      quoted]....
                          "It is to reveal the great truth that Christ is an example of
                      what we through His grace are to be in our intercourse with
                      each other. It shows that the entire life should be one of hum-

Disinterested Benevolence        LESSON 7                                 Tuesday
                                                                      November 13

            Part 3      Even when facing death, how did Jesus relate to the
THE UNRESTRICTED     Father's will?
              GIFT      "And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and
       Matt. 26:39   prayed, saying, 0 my Father, if it be possible, let this cup
                     pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt."

                        This experience of Jesus is an illustration of love and dis-
                     interested benevolence. Jesus did not say, "No one else is
                     being asked to give as much as I am. They won't appreciate
                     my gift anyway. Why should I give?" Jesus knew many would
                     never accept His gift, yet He gave. He realized that some would
                     actually misuse His gift of life, but He gave it anyway. Why
                     did He? Why should I? Because He viewed the purpose for
                     which He gave as more valuable than the gift itself. The pur-
                     pose of Jesus' gift was the salvation of a person. The gift was
                     His life.
                        Consider again the unrestricted nature of God's gift. John
                     3:16.
                        Self-interest and personal advantage have sometimes been
                     the basis for giving. Such motives for giving make the gift
                     not really a gift at all, but a kind of purchase, because one
                     is seeking advantage for which he is willing to pay the price
                     of the gift. The Father and the Son sought advantage only for
                     the creatures of the universe. Their's was a true gift.

                        What words in Christ's invitation show that His relationship
                     with people is impartial? Matt. 11:28.

 THINK IT THROUGH       In what ways do my attitudes and responses demonstrate
                     Christlike benevolence? In what ways not?

                        "Christ recognized no distinction of nationality or rank or
                     creed. The Scribes and Pharisees desired to make a local and
                     a national benefit of all the gifts of heaven and to exclude
                     the rest of God's family in the world. But Christ came to break
                     down every wall of partition. He came to show that His gift
                     of mercy and love is as unconfined as the air, the light, or the
                     showers of rain that refresh the earth.
                        "The life of Christ established a religion in which there is
                     no caste, a religion by which Jew and Gentile, free and bond,
                     are linked in a common brotherhood, equal before God. No
                     question of policy influenced His movements. He made no dif-
                     ference between neighbors and strangers, friends and enemies.
                     That which appealed to His heart was a soul thirsting for the
                     waters of life."—Testimonies, Vol. 9, pp. 190, 191.

            Part 4      What attitude of Lucifer was the root of his fall?
    BENEVOLENCE
       PERVERTED        "How art thou fallen from heaven, 0 Lucifer, son of the
     Isa. 14:12-14   morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst
                     weaken the nations! For thou hast said in thine heart, I will
                     ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of
                     God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the
                     sides of the north: I will ascend above the heights of the
                     clouds; I will be like the most High."


                         Speaking to the angelic host, Satan "introduced his subject,
                     which was himself. . . . He stated to them that he had called
                     them together to assure them that he no longer would submit
                     to this invasion of his rights and theirs; that never would he
                     again bow down to Christ; that he would take the honor upon
                     himself which should have been conferred upon him, and would
                     be the commander of all who would submit to follow him and
                     obey his voice."—The Story of Redemption, pages 14, 15.
                         "The greatness and power with which the Creator endowed
                     Lucifer, he has perverted; yet when it suits his purpose, he can
                     impart to men sentiments that are enchanting. Satan can inspire
                     his agents with thoughts that appear elevating and noble. Did
                     he not come to Christ with quotations of Scripture when he
                     designed to overthrow Him with specious temptations? It is
                     thus that he comes to men, disguising his temptations under
                     an appearance of goodness and making them believe him to
                      be the friend rather than the enemy of humanity. In this way
                     he has deceived and seduced the race, beguiling them with
                      subtle temptations, bewildering them with specious decep-
                      tions."—Counsels to Teachers, page 27.

                     life was characterized by disinterested benevolence. Precious
                     Saviour! What sacrifices has He made for us that we should
                     not perish, but have everlasting life! Heaven will be cheap
                     enough if we resign every selfish interest to obtain it. Can we
                     afford to have our own way, and take ourselves out of the
                     hands of God, because it is more pleasing to the natural
                     heart? God requires perfect submission and perfect obedience.
                     Eternal life is worth everything to us. You may come in close
                     connection with God if you will agonize to enter in at the

      UNRESTRICTED      henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for
          2 Car. 5:15   them, and rose again."

                            When we give the self to God without restrictions, we no
                        longer belong to self. We are dead to self. In this time of the
                        end every member and family in the local congregation should
                        look for ways to cooperate and assist each other to finish the
                        the work of God. A spirit of disinterested benevolence, unsel-
                        fish liberality, would allow God to work miracles among us.
                            "Unselfish liberality threw the early church into a transport
                        of joy; for the believers knew that their efforts were helping
                        to send the gospel message to those in darkness. Their benev-
                        olence testified that they had not received the grace of God
                        in vain. What could produce such liberality but the sanctifica-
                        tion of the Spirit? In the eyes of believers and unbelievers it
                        was a miracle of grace."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 344.

                        share what he has that another may hear the message and the
                        invitation of Jesus. God calls us out from our narrow, restricted
                        sphere. He urges us to expand our thinking and our concept
                        of a completed work in our own lives and throughout the world.
                            "The liberality required of the Hebrews was largely to ben-
                        efit their own nation; today the work of God extends over all
                        the earth. In the hands of His followers, Christ has placed the
                        treasures of the gospel, and upon them He has laid the respon-
                        sibility of giving the glad tidings of salvation to the world.
                        Surely our obligations are much greater than were those of
                        ancient Israel."—The Acts of the Apostles, pages 337, 338.
                            The message—as well as money—must not be restricted by
                        God's people.

            Part 6      What is the extent of God's generosity toward us?
NO LOST BLESSINGS        "He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up
         Rom. 8:32   for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all
                     things?"
                         What illustration did Jesus give of the Father's impartial
                     gifts? Matt. 5:45.
                         "God pours His blessings upon all. 'He maketh His sun to
                     rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just
                     and on the unjust.' He is 'kind unto the unthankful and to the
                     evil.' Luke 6:35. He bids us to be like Him. 'Bless them that
                     curse you,' said Jesus; 'do good to them that hate you, . . .
                     that ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven.'
                     These are the principles of the law, and they are the well-
                     springs of life."—The Desire of Ages, page 311.
                         All of our gifts are gifts to Christ if they are given from the
                     right motive. The question of consequence to the giver is not
                     how the gift is eventually used, but Why did he give it? Jesus
                     healed ten lepers, and nine of them, ungrateful, continued their
                     same old sinful life.
                         "For the sake of this one man, who would make a right use
                      of the blessing of health, Jesus healed the whole ten. The
                      nine passed on without appreciating the work done, and ren-
                      dered no grateful thanks to Jesus for doing the work."—Testi-

                          "Those self-sacrificing, consecrated ones who render back
                      to God the things that are His, as He requires of them, will be
                      rewarded according to their works. Even though the means

                      in sincerity of soul, with an eye single to the glory of God, will
                      not lose their reward.
                          "Those who have made a wrong use of means dedicated to
                      God will be required to give an account of their stewardship."

  THINK IT THROUGH       As I review my attitudes toward God's work, in what ways
                      should I change?

                         "Christ unsparingly condemned abuses, but He was careful
                      not to lessen obligation. He rebuked the selfishness that ex-

                      commended the widow who brought her offering to God's
                      treasury. Man's abuse of the gift could not turn God's blessing
                      from the giver."—The Desire of Ages, page 614.

                      our privilege to know, to love, and trust, and with whom we
                      may have blessed fellowship. Dependence upon something
                      else than God, whether it be wealth, knowledge, position, or
                      friends, places us in peril."—SDA Bible Commentary, on Ex.

                          "Are we worshipers of Jehovah, or of Baal? of the living

                      may be no image for the eye to rest upon; yet we may be
                      practicing idolatry. It is as easy to make an idol of cherished
                      ideas or objects as to fashion gods of wood or stone. Thou-
                      sands have a false conception of God and His attributes. They
                      are as verily serving a false god as were the servants of Baal."

                         What two truths about God the Son mentioned in Heb.
                      1:10-12 establish His importance?

                         The Godhead is the original and permanent Intelligence
                      which is both the Source and Sustainer of the universe. Man
                      should regard Him as first because He is first in every way.
                      God must become the supreme meaning in the life of each one
                      seeking salvation. No thing and no one is to come before Him,
                      because that which replaces God is in a false position. God
                      was first from the very beginning. He is first today. He will
                      ever be first. When a person accepts this reality experientially
                      he has found the key point in overcoming idolatry. When a
                      person really knows God, "whom to know is life eternal," he
                      will want it no other way. Duty becomes a delight.

            Part 2      What divine message to Baruch is still appropriate today?
WARNINGS AGAINST        "And seekest thou great things for thyself? seek them
       SELF FIRST    not: for, behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith the
         ler. 45:5   Lord: but thy life will I give unto thee for a prey in all places
                     whither thou goest."

                        "The Lord has no place in His work for those who have a
                     greater desire to win the crown than to bear the cross. He
                     wants- men who are more intent upon doing their duty than
                     upon receiving their reward—men who are more solicitous for
                     principle than for promotion.
                        "Those who are humble, and who do their work as unto
                     God, may not make so great a show as do those who are full
                     of bustle and self-importance; but their work counts for more.
                     Often those who make a great parade call attention to self,
                     interposing between the people and God, and their work proves
                     a failure."—The Ministry of Healing, pages 476, 477.
                        "Lucifer thought that he was himself a favorite in heaven
                     among the angels. He had been highly exalted, but this did
                     not call forth from him gratitude and praise to his Creator. He
                     aspired to the height of God Himself. He gloried in his lofti-
                     ness. He knew that he was honored by the angels. He had a
                     special mission to execute. He had been near the great Crea-
                     tor, and the ceaseless beams of glorious light enshrouding the
                     eternal God had shone especially upon him. He thought how
                     angels had obeyed his command with pleasurable alacrity.
                     Were not his garments light and beautiful? Why should Christ
                     thus be honored before himself."—The Story of Redemption,

                       What unwise and deceptive measure of the self does Paul
                     condemn? 2 Cor. 10:12.

 THINK IT THROUGH      How far from God have I permitted Satan to lead me?
                     How do I view myself? Am I comparing myself with Jesus?
                     What will be the result of such a comparison?

                       "Human beings belong to one great family—the family of
                     God. The Creator designed that they should respect and love
                     one another, ever manifesting a pure, unselfish interest in one
                     another's welfare. But Satan's aim has been to lead men to
                     self first; and yielding themselves to his control, they have
                     developed a selfishness that has filled the world with misery
                     and strife, setting human beings at variance with one another."

             Part 3      When Judah was accused of robbing God, what did God
      THE CURSE OF    say was the result?
         SELF FIRST       "Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even
           Mal. 3:9   this whole nation."

                          When one man robs another, the robber has considered
                      himself before his victim, and enriches himself at the victim's
                      expense.
                          A curse is a strong denunciation and is the opposite of a
                      blessing. While both curse and blessing are verbal, there are
                      literal results that follow when God is the speaker. The bless-
                      ings promised in verses 10-12 are pronounced on the crops,
                      and the curse, unidentified, is presumably crop failure.

                         What curses came upon Judah after the exile when self-
                      interest dictated their priorities? Hag. 1:4-11.

                          "Because they had let the temple lie waste, the Lord sent
                      upon their substance a wasting drought. God had bestowed
                      upon them the fruits of field and garden, the corn and the wine
                      and the oil, as a token of His favor; but because they had used
                      these bountiful gifts so selfishly, the blessings were re-
                      moved....
                          "The lack of temporal prosperity was the result of a neglect
                      to put God's interests first, the prophets declared. Had the
                      Israelites honored God, had they shown Him due respect and
                      courtesy, by making the building of His house their first work,
                      they would have invited His presence and blessing."—Prophets
                      and Kings, pages 573, 574.
                          "God's requirements come first. We are not doing His will
                      if we consecrate to Him what is left of our income after all our
                      imaginary wants have been supplied. Before any part of our
                      earnings is consumed, we should take out and present to Him
                      that portion which He claims. . . . But when a man robs God
                      by withholding that which He requires, His curse rests upon
                      the whole."—Testimonies, Vol. 4, p. 477.

 THINK IT THROUGH        What in my life am I putting before God?

                          "The increase of their property strengthens the eager desire
                      for more, until some consider that their giving to the Lord a
                      tenth is a severe and unjust tax. . . . God has tested some of
                      these by giving them riches; but with the riches came the
                      fiercer temptation, and their benevolence was far less than in
                      the days of their poverty. A grasping desire for greater riches
                      absorbed their minds and hearts, and they committed idolatry."

           Part 4      Upon what principle are God's blessings promised?
   THE BLESSINGS       "Honour the Lord with thy substance, and with the first
      OF PUTTING    fruits of all thine increase: so shall thy barns be filled with
       GOD FIRST    plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine."
     Prov. 3:9,10
                        "Every believer should be wholehearted in his attachment
                    to the church. Its prosperity should be his first interest. . . . It
                    is in the power of all to do something for the cause of God."
                    —Testimonies, Vol. 4, p. 18.
                      What blessings were promised to Judah if they would put
                    God first in specific ways? Mal. 3:10-12; Isa. 58:13, 14.
                         God makes an unusual promise to those who put Him first.
                    "Those who are ready and willing to invest in the cause of
                    God, will be blessed in their efforts to acquire money. . . .
                         "We must ever bear in mind that we are in copartnership
                    with God. His work and His cause demand the first considera-
                    tion."—Our High Calling, page 194.
                         God's share of our life should be reserved first. (1) Adhere
                    to the health message for the care of your body. (2) Return
                    the tithe and give liberal offerings to God. (3) Dedicate and
                    use a portion of your abilities in daily working for God. Take
                    time to be a real Christian every day. (4) Remember the Sab-
                    bath day and keep it holy. Make the Sabbath "a delight, the
                    holy of the Lord, honourable."
                         This must not be an occasional consecration, but a way of
                     life, done systematically, disinterestedly because you love God.
                         The question is not if God can supply whatever is needed
                     to advance His work, but can man be a channel which will not
                     be blocked by selfishness. "And if men will become channels
                     through which heaven's blessing can flow to others, the Lord
                     will keep the channel supplied."—Counsels on Stewardship,

 THINK IT THROUGH       What blessings have I received as a result of making God
                    first in my life?
                       "There are but few who consider the binding claims that
                    God has upon them to make it their first business to meet the
                    necessities of His cause and let their own desires be served
                    last. There are but few who invest in God's cause in proportion
                    to their means. Many have fastened their money in property
                    which they must sell before they can invest it in the cause of
                    God. . . . They have as effectually buried their money in the
                    earth as had the man in the parable. They rob God of the
                    tenth, ... and in robbing Him they rob themselves of the heav-

             Part 5      What seemingly selfish request did Elijah make of the
A LESSON OF TRUST     widow of Zarephath?
      1 Kings 17:13     "And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou
                      host said: but make me thereof a little cake first."
                         Why should God, through Elijah, ask this poor woman to
                      share with Elijah the very last food she had for her son and
                      herself? The request was even more unusual coming from a
                      stranger and a foreigner.
                         What promise accompanied this request? Verse 14.
                          "No greater test of faith than this could have been required.
                      The widow had hitherto treated all strangers with kindness and
                      liberality. Now, regardless of the suffering that might result to
                      herself and child, and trusting in the God of Israel to supply
                      her every need, she met this supreme test of hospitality by
                      doing 'according to the saying of Elijah.'
                          "Wonderful was the hospitality shown to God's prophet by
                      this Phoenician woman, and wonderfully were her faith and
                      generosity rewarded. 'She, and he, and her house, did eat
                      many days. And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the
                      cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the Lord, which He
                      spake by Elijah.' "—Prophets and Kings, pages 130, 131.
                          "Give what you can now, and as you cooperate with Christ,
                      your hand will open to impart still more. And God will refill
                      your hand."—Our High Calling, page 199.
                          God repeats, in principle, the same promises today as He
                      did through Elijah to the widow. Each individual is given oppor-
                      tunity to demonstrate trust in God by putting Him first.
                          God expects to be first in every respect. He desires to dem-
                      onstrate that -He provides for those who put their trust and
                      confidence in Him. It may take some nearly bare cupboards,
                      and a request to give what is left to a stranger, before some
                      of us will know whether or not we have put God first in our
                      lives and believe His promises.
 THINK IT THROUGH         To those who know me best, is my life a demonstration of
                      trust in God?
                          "We try too hard to take care of self ourselves. We are
                      uneasy and greatly lack a firm trust in God. Many worry and
                      work, contrive and plan, fearing they may suffer need. They
                      cannot afford time to pray or to attend religious meetings and,
                      in their care for themselves, leave no chance for God to care
                      for them. And the Lord does not do much for them, for they
                      give Him no opportunity. They do too much for themselves,
                      and believe and trust in God too little."—Testimonies, Vol. 2,

                     of the Lord thy God which he hath given thee."

                        Three times each year all able-bodied men went to Shiloh,
                     and later to Jerusalem. Behind them they left their orchards,
                     crops, herds, and homes. It would seem that they were inviting
                     plunder from the people who previously occupied the land
                     Israel now held. There were no visible signs of protection
                     along their nonpermanent borders.

                         What promise did God make and fulfill during the absence
                     of these men from their homes? Ex. 34:23, 24.

                        In order to appreciate what was happening, one must note
                     that God promised that these people were (1) to come into pos-
                     session of a land they could not conquer alone, (2) to houses
                     they had not built, and (3) to fields they had not cleared. God
                     said He would cast out the nations before them, fight their
                     battles, and provide for all their needs if He was given first
                     place in their lives. No man would even desire their land.
                        They gave tithes, offerings, and time—more than thirty days
                     yearly, besides the regular Sabbath days.
                        Why did God ask this? So that in their individual lives they
                     would be related to God's interests. His interests were becom-
                     ing theirs. Also they would be remembering their origin and
                     the origin of all they possessed.
                        "We have nothing to fear for the future, except as we shall
                     forget the way the Lord has led us, and His teaching in our

           Part 1       What instructions concerning offerings did the apostle Paul
  GRACE OF GIVING    give to the Corinthians?
        2 Cor. 8:1      "Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and
                     utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your
                     love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also."

                        Paul was here commending the Corinthians in their attain-
                     ment of certain virtues and admonishing them not to come
                     short in the virtue of giving. His words were not written as an
                     order (verse 8) but to encourage them in giving as proof of
                     their love.
                        "This matter of giving is not left to impulse. God has given
                     us definite instruction in regard to it. He has specified tithes
                     and offerings as the measure of our obligation. And He desires
                     us to give regularly and systematically."—Counsels on Stew-
                     ardship, pages 80, 81.
                        Some people wait until an appeal for money is made for
                     some particular purpose before they give. The practice of
                     giving only in response to an appeal most often results in
                     church poverty.
                         "The Lord requires gifts to be made at stated times, being
                      so arranged that giving will become habit and benevolence be
                     felt to be a Christian duty. The heart, opened by one gift, is
                      not to have time to become selfishly cold and to close before
                     the next is bestowed. The stream is to be continually flowing,
                      thus keeping open the channel by acts of benevolence."—
                     Testimonies, Vol. 3, pp. 393, 394.
                         "The cause of benevolence would no longer be dependent
                      on the uncertain gifts of impulse, and vary according to the
                      changing feelings of men."—Counsels on Stewardship, pages

                        "I was shown the awful fact that Satan and his angels
                     have had more to do with the management of the property of
                     God's professed people than the Lord has. Stewards of the
                     last days are unwise. They suffer Satan to control their business

                     be in, the cause of God. God takes notice of you, unfaithful
                     stewards; He will call you to account.... But I saw that Satan
                     and his angels exult over their success in this matter. And
                     those who should be wise heirs of salvation almost willingly
                     let their Lord's money slip out of their hands into the enemy's
                     ranks. In this way they strengthen Satan's kingdom, and seem

             Part 2       What positive guide did Paul give concerning the offering
      COLLECTIONS     of the Corinthians? 2 Cor. 8:11, 12.
     OR OFFERINGS?
                          Paul was here admonishing the Corinthians to follow through
                      with a previous willingness (verse 10) to give an offering for
                      the needs of their fellow believers.
                          God does not expect us to give more than we are able to
                      give. If we give willingly as we are able, God accepts it as the
                      fulfillment of our stewardship. He does not ask us to give what
                      we do not have.
                          The Sabbath services are not the ideal time to determine
                      how much we are able to give. A look at two words—collec-
                      tion and offering—may help point out two different attitudes in
                      giving. We say that we "take up" a collection. The initiative
                      is with the one in charge of the meeting and those helping him,
                      and people respond to the leader's appeal by placing money
                      in a plate or basket. On the other hand we say that we "give"
                      an offering. The initiative in this instance is with the giver. He
                      has brought an offering to the meeting and is waiting for the
                      opportunity to give it. This does not mean that "collections"
                      are wrong, but it points out that planned offerings are the
                      better way.

                        What equality of responsibility did Paul teach to the
                      Corinthian church? 2 Cor. 8:13, 14.


                         "He had established in the Corinthian church, as also in
                      Galatia, a system of weekly offerings, and had enjoined upon
                      Titus, in his visit to Corinth, to give special attention to for-
                      warding this benevolent enterprise."—Sketches From the Life
                      of Paul, page 174.

 THINK IT THROUGH        Is my gift presented as an offering or as a collection?


                         "As the persevering, systematic workers see that the ten-
                      dency of their benevolent efforts is to nourish love to God and
                      their fellow men, and that their personal efforts are extending
                      their sphere of usefulness, they will realize that it is a great
                      blessing to be co-workers with Christ. The Christian church,
                      as a general thing, are disowning the claims of God upon them
                      to give alms of the things which they possess to support the
                      warfare against the moral darkness which is flooding the

           Part 3       What is the apostle Paul's rule for giving?
   THE APOSTOLIC        "Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay
             RULE    by him in store, as God hath prospered him, that there be
       1 Cor. 16:2   no gatherings when I come."
                         This verse contains what Ellen G. White refers to as the
                     rule of the apostle. It gives information about why, how, how
                     much, and when to give.
                         "The apostle suggests the first day of the week as a proper
                     time to review the course of Providence and the prosperity
                     experienced, and in the fear of God, with true gratitude of
                     heart for the blessings He has bestowed, to decide how much,
                     according to His own devised plan, shall be rendered back to
                     Him."—Testimonies, Vol. 3, p. 413.
                         "The directions given by the Holy Spirit through the apostle
                     Paul in regard to gifts, present a principle that applies also to
                     tithing: 'Upon the first day of the week let every one of you
                     lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him.' Parents and
                     children are here included. Not only the rich, but the poor, are
                     addressed. 'Every man according as he purposeth in his heart
                     [through the candid consideration of God's prescribed plan],
                     so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth
                     a cheerful giver.' The gifts are to be made in consideration of
                     the great goodness of God to us."—Counsels on Stewardship,
                     page 80.
                        What is the purpose of this apostolic rule? 1 Cor. 16:2.
                        The people were to make their decisions at home. Here,
                     with your own conscience, you may reflect upon God's bless-
                     ings and respond as God has made it possible for you to
                     respond. The offering should be brought to the place of worship
                     at the proper time. The offering is "offered" to God as an act
                     of worship. It is an intergral part of worship.
 THINK IT THROUGH      . Am I planning my offerings or putting money into a col-

                     ting aside the tithe and presenting our offerings to God? On
                     the Sabbath we have thought upon His goodness. We have
                     beheld His work in creation as an evidence of His power in
                     redemption. Our hearts are filled with thankfulness for His great
                     love. And now, before the toil of a week begins, we return to
                     Him His own, and with it an offering to testify our gratitude.
                     Thus our practice will be a weekly sermon, declaring that God
                     is the possessor of all our property, and that He has made us

                Part 4      What principle for giving did Paul advocate?
     PLANNED GIVING         "So I thought it necessary to urge the brethren to go on
       2 Cor. 9:5, RSV   to you before me, and arrange in advance for this gift you
                         have promised, so that it may be ready not as an exaction
                         but as a willing gift."

                             Paul arranged, in the experience recorded in 2 Cor. 9, that
                         the amount of the Corinthian believers' gifts would be deter-
                         mined prior to the occasion upon which they were to be offered.
                         And also today there should be a plan for giving worked out
                         by each believer to fit his particular circumstances. Some
                         common practices that reflect careless stewardship are noted
                         below:
                             1. Waiting until Sabbath to set aside the tithe.
                             2. Making the decision on the amount of an offering at
                         church instead of at home.
                             3. Borrowing from money set aside for tithe or offering.
                             4. Making offerings from money needed for family neces-
                         sities.
                             5. Giving for expenses instead of to God.
                             Planned giving is God's plan. Happiness in giving is the
                         result. Here is God's plan for happy giving.
                             1. Determine and set aside the tithe (10 percent) first, at
                         home.
                             2. Determine how much you are going to give to God in
                         offerings. Set this aside at the time you separate the tithe.
                             3. Distribute your offerings at home by recording the tithe
                         and offerings on the envelope provided for this purpose. Re-
                         member world missions as well as local budget.
                             4. Use your money as you see best.
                             5. Carry God's tithe and offerings to church.
                             6. View your gift as an offering to God, not as a collection
                         for expenses.
                             7. Increase the percentage of your offerings as God in-
                         creases your income and/or ability to give.

                            What principle applicable to the whole life should be the
                         basis for determining the amount of offerings? Luke 12:48, ,
                         last part.

 THINK IT THROUGH           Do I plan my giving, or am I an impulse giver?

                             "To give or to labor when our sympathies are moved, and
                         to withhold our gifts or service when the emotions are not
                         stirred, is an unwise and dangerous course."—Counsels on

                                                                       November 29

            Part 5      What command did God give Hezekiah near the close of
    ACCUMULATED      his life?
     POSSESSIONS        "In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And the
      2 Kings 20:1   prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto
                     him, Thus saith the Lord, Set thine house in order; for thou
                     shalt die, and not live."

                         King Hezekiah was told to set his "house in order." The
                     king was to make preparation for turning over the realm to
                     another and care for all the details implied in such plans.
                         We are not kings, nor has a special revelation been given
                     to us pointing out the time of our death, but the counsel is
                     appropriate to all of us. Life is uncertain. We have no assur-
                     ance of another day of life. "Set thine house in order!" The
                     responsibility to arrange our affairs for the moment of death
                     is a part of faithful stewardship.

                        In the parable of Jesus about a certain rich man, what
                     searching question did God ask? Luke 12:20.

                        One must remember that man does not own anything in
                     relation to God. Prior to our death, faithfulness to our trust
                     requires that we plan our final gifts and make provision for
                     the proper distribution and use of the possessions God has
                     enabled us to accumulate during our lifetime.
                        "Whose shall these things be?" is a question that is appli-
                     cable to each of us. This is an integral part of faithful steward-
                     ship, yet it is often at this critical stage in life that a person
                     forgets God.
                        "Many are not exercised upon the subject of making their
                     wills while they are in apparent health. But this precaution
                     should be taken by our brethren. . . . They should arrange
                     their property in such a manner that they may leave it at any
                     time."—Counsels on Stewardship, page 328.

 THINK IT THROUGH       What provision have I made for the stewardship of my
                     goods after my death?

                        "Death will not come one day sooner, brethren, because
                     you have made your will. In disposing of your property by will
                     to your relatives, be sure that you do not forget God's cause.
                     You are His agents, holding His property; and His claims
                     should have your first consideration. Your wife and children,
                     of course, should not be left destitute; provision should be
                     made for them if they are needy."—Counsels on Stewardship,

                       sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also
                       bountifully."


                          "The sower multiplies his seed by casting it away. So it is
                       with those who are faithful in distributing God's gifts. By im-

                       a sufficiency that they may continue to give. . . .
                          "And more than this is wrapped up in the sowing and the
                       reaping. As we distribute God's temporal blessings, the evi-

                       fruit unto eternal life."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 86.

                       giver? 2 Cor. 9:8.


                          "God calls for what you owe Him in tithes and offerings. He
                       calls for consecration in every line of His work. Act faithfully

 THINK IT THROUGH         What shows that I realize that my church is a home base
                       and a mission field?


                           "To show a liberal, self-denying spirit for the success of
                       foreign missions is a sure way to advance home missionary
                       work; for the prosperity of the home work depends largely,
                       under God, upon the reflex influence of the evangelical work
                       done in countries afar off....
                           "That which is given to start the work in one field will result
                       in strengthening the work in other places. As the laborers are

                       are established, there will be increasing financial strength. As
                       these churches grow stronger, they will be able not only to
                       carry on the work in their own borders, but to send help to

                                                                       December 2

          Part 1       What was the source of Israel's prosperity?
          A TEST
       Deut. 8:18      "But thou shalt remember the Lord thy God: for it is he
                    that giveth thee power to get wealth, that he may establish
                    his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers, as it is this
                    day."

                        There is recorded in Testimonies, Vol. 2, pp. 268-291 a long
                    communication from Ellen G. White to a sister who had suf-
                    mered from domestic problems, ill health, and poverty, and who
                    later was relieved of all of these problems. At one point in
                    recounting this sister's experience, Ellen G. White recorded
                    the following paragraph.
                        "The Lord said to His angel who had hitherto ministered
                    unto you: 'I have proved her in poverty and affliction, and she
                    has not separated herself from Me, nor rebelled against Me. I
                    will now prove her with prosperity. I will reveal to her a page
                    of the human heart with which she is unacquainted. I will
                    show her that money is the most dangerous foe she has ever
                    met. I will reveal to her the deceitfulness of riches; that they
                    are a snare, even to those who feel that they are secure from
                    selfishness, and proof against exaltation, extravagance, pride,
                    and love of the praise of men.' "—Testimonies, Vol. 2, p. 278.
                        We very easily conclude, as did the Jews of Jesus' time,
                    that prosperity is God's reward to us for our faithfulness, and
                     therefore an evidence of divine favor upon our lives. The above
                    experience indicates the falsity of such conclusions.
                        "The Lord sometimes tests His people with prosperity in
                     temporal things. But He intends that they shall make a right
                     use of His gifts. Their property, their time, their strength, and
                     their opportunities are all of God. For all these blessings they
                     must account to the Giver."—Testimonies, Vol. 4, p. 619.

                       What do you think is included in the prosperity of the
                    blessed man described in Ps. 1:1-3?

 THINK IT THROUGH      How am I responding to prosperity?

                        "The heavenly Guest is standing at your door, while you are
                    piling up obstructions to bar His entrance. Jesus is knocking
                    through the prosperity He gives you. He loads you with bless-
                    ings to test your fidelity, that they may flow out from you to
                    others. Will you permit your selfishness to triumph? Will you
                    squander God's talents and lose your soul through idolatrous
                    love of the blessings He has given?"—Ellen G. White Com-

              Part 2       For what purpose is man to labor?
     THE PURPOSE OF      "Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that
         PROSPERITY    meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of
           John 6:21   man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed."
                            "The labor that Jesus rebukes here is not that which is nec-
                       essary in order to gain a livelihood. His rebuke is directed
                       rather toward those who carry such labor to the extent of
                       neglecting the nourishment of the soul. What Jesus here re-
                       proves is the common habit of laboring only for the things of
                       time, and ignoring the things of eternity."—SDA Bible Com-

                           The desire to accumulate wealth is not necessarily an evil
                       desire, but it "is an original affection of our nature, implanted
                       there by our heavenly Father for noble ends."—Counsels on

                       than sand, only as used to provide for the daily necessities of

                       are not ours, but are entrusted to us to test our honesty. Let

                       116, 117.
                           As God raises our potential or ability to give, He also in-
                       creases our responsibility to give. Possessions increase respon-
                       sibilities. God prospers us to see whether or not we will keep
                       all for ourselves or return God's share for the support of His
                       cause.
 THINK IT THROUGH         How am I using God's gifts to me?
                          "If they choose, men may refuse to connect themselves with
                       their Maker; they may refuse to give themselves to His service,
                       and trade upon His entrusted goods; they may fail to exercise
                       frugality and self-denial, and may forget that the Lord requires
                       a return of what He has given them. All such are unfaithful
                       stewards.
                          "A faithful steward will do all he possibly can in the service
                       of God; the one object before him will be the great need of
                       the world. He will realize that the message of truth is to be
                       given, not only in his own neighborhood, but in the regions
                       beyond. When men cherish this spirit, the love of the truth
                       and the sanctification they will receive through the truth, will
                       banish avarice, overreaching, and every species of dishonesty."

Prosperity LESSON 10                                                    ❑ Tuesday
                                                                        December 4

           Part 3       What question did Jeremiah ask of God?
  SATAN PROSPERS
                        "Wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper? where-
     SOME PEOPLE     fore are all they happy that deal very treacherously?"
         ler. 12:1
                        "I saw that God is not in all the riches that are obtained.
                     Satan often has much more to do with acquiring property than
                     God."—Testimonies, Vol. 1, p. 175.
                        This amazing statement explains why many of the wicked
                     prosper. Satan aids some to obtain wealth.

                        What principle taught by Jesus can explain why Satan
                     prospers some people? Matt. 6:24.

                         The danger of prosperity is made extremely clear in the
                     following statement. "In the midst of prosperity lurks danger.
                     Throughout the ages, riches and honor have ever been attended
                     with peril to humility and spirituality. . . Affliction and adver-
                     sity may cause sorrow, but it is prosperity that is most dan-
                     gerous to spiritual life. Unless the human subject is in con-
                     stant submission to the will of God, unless he is sanctified by
                     the truth, prosperity will surely arouse the natural inclination
                     to presumption."—Prophets and Kings, pages 59, 60.

                         What wages were many still seeking in Peter's day? Is
                     it still true? 2 •Peter 2:15.

                        Worldly gain, honor, and riches are often employed by Satan
                     to cause man's downfall. "The tempter is ever presenting
                     worldly gain and honor to entice men from the service of
                     God. He tells them it is their overconscientiousness that keeps
                     them from prosperity. Thus many are induced to venture out
                     of the path of strict integrity."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page
                     440.

                     perity?

                        "I saw that Satan watches the peculiar, selfish, covetous
                     temperament of some who profess the truth, and he will tempt
                     them by throwing prosperity in their path, offering them the
                     riches of earth. He knows that if they do not overcome their
                     natural temperament, they will stumble and fall by loving
                     mammon, worshiping their idol. Satan's object is often accom-
                     plished. The strong love of the world overcomes, or swallows
                     up, the love of the truth."—Testimonies, Vol. 1, p. 142.

Prosperity LESSON 10                                                   ❑ Wednesday
                                                                         December 5

             Part 4       What did God warn Israel would happen to them if they
     ISRAEL FORGOT     forgot Him and worshiped other gods?
          Deut. 8:19      "And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the Lord thy God,
                       and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship
                       them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish."
                           One of the greatest dangers of prosperity is that the one
                       who has been prospered will forget God. Before God led the
                       Hebrews out of Egypt, He had already planned for their pros-
                       perity. He carefully explained the dangers of prosperity. Part
                       of His explanation is in Deut. 8:2, 7. God advised Israel to
                       remember. In verses 11, 14, and 19 God implored them not to
                       forget. He said that if they forgot they would perish. God
                       blessed them as He promised, and with prosperity came the
                       dangers of which He warned.
                           Israel forgot the 40 years of manna, the water from the
                       rock, the clothing that did not wear out, the Red Sea, the
                       Jordan River, and Jericho.
                           "It is not the empty cup that we have difficulty in carrying;
                       it is the cup full to the brim that must be carefully balanced."
                       —Prophets and Kings, pages 59, 60.
                         What experience of Israel showed their complete depen-
                       dence on God for all they possessed? Deut. 6:10-12.
                            We think it is unusual that God gave Israel great and goodly
                       cities which they did not build, houses they did not construct,
                       filled with things they did not make or purchase, wells of pure
                       water they did not dig, and vineyards and olive groves ready
                       to harvest. Do we forget that all we possess is of God? Why
                       is it so easy to see the faults in the people of Israel but not
                       those in our own lives? Have we forgotten God?
 THINK IT THROUGH         In what ways am I in danger of forgetting God?
                          "God is constantly bestowing upon you the blessings of
                       this life; and if He asks you to dispense His gifts by helping
                       the various branches of His work, it is for your own temporal
                       and spiritual interest to do so, and thus acknowledge God as
                       the giver of every blessing. God, as the Master Worker, coop-
                       erates with men in securing the means necessary for their
                       sustenance; and He requires them to cooperate with Him in
                       the salvation of souls. He has placed in the hands of His ser-
                       vants the means wherewith to carry forward His work in home
                       and foreign missions. But if only half the people do their duty,
                       the treasury will not be supplied with the necessary funds, and
                       many parts of the work of God must be left incomplete."—

          Part 5       What is one source from which people who forget God
     DANGERS OF     seek security?
     PROSPERITY
        Ps. 52:7       "Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength; but
                    trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened
                    himself in his wickedness."


                        "There are many whose hearts have been so hardened by
                    prosperity that they forget God, and forget the wants of their
                    fellow-men. Professed Christians adorn themselves with jew-
                    elry, laces, costly apparel, while the Lord's poor suffer for the
                    necessities of life. Men and women who claim redemption
                    through a Saviour's blood will squander the means intrusted to
                    them for the saving of other souls, and then grudgingly dole
                    out their offerings for religion, giving liberally only when it will
                    bring honor to themselves. These are idolaters."—Sons and
                    Daughters of God, page 57.

                       What did Jesus teach is to be the object of the use of the
                    believers' resources? John 6:27.


                       Jesus urged the people not to spend energy, time, and money
                    on things of little or no eternal consequence. God gives iden-

                    upon you, and the wants of His cause. Selfishness has led
                    you to expend money in ornaments for the gratification of your-
                    self and your children. You did not think that this money was
                    not yours; that it was only lent you to test and prove you, to

                       and this house lie waste?"
                          For fifteen years Israel neglected the cause of God. The
                       foundation of the temple had been laid the year following their
                       return from Babylon, 535 B.C., and by 520 B.C. no additional
                       work had been done on the building. They worked hard for
                       themselves, but they did not prosper, for God had removed
                       His blessing from them. They were putting self before God.
                          "The lack of temporal prosperity was the result of a neglect
                       to put God's interests first, the prophets declared. Had the

            WHAT IS        "Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, 0 God."
        SACRIFICE?
                            The word "sacrifice" has always had an elusive meaning
Heb. 10:9, first part
                        to those suffering from prosperity. Sacrifice has sometimes
                        been carried to extremes, and has often been misused. Chil-
                        dren have been given as living sacrifices. Food is offered to
                        gods of stone by starving people. There have been those who
                        have sacrificed because they felt it was necessary in order to
                        secure the favor of deity. Even today some Christians may give
                        to secure God's favor.
                            Sacrifice begins as an attitude. An evaluation then takes
                        place in the mind, and the decision is carried out in the life.
                        Sacrifice is an attitude that leads to action toward God in
                        regard to your life and experience. Because of this, sacrifice
                        varies with each of us in application.
                            If your attitude is correct, you will regard your life, body,
                        abilities, possessions, and time, as belonging to God and as
                        available for Him to do with them as He will. It is not only a
                        matter of how much God wants, but also of when He wants
                        it. You will be ready to surrender any part, or all, of your life
                        into His service whenever He calls for help or you see a need.
                           What true sacrifice replaced the symbol of sacrifice? Heb.
                        10:5, 6.
                           Sacrifice was planned in heaven and inaugurated in the
                        Garden of Eden. Its greatest manifestation was on a cross
                        where hung the body of Jesus Christ. The whole plan of sal-
                        vation was founded upon the principle of sacrifice. Later the
                        Christian church was founded upon the same principle.
                           The result of sacrifice is that God can do with you whatever
                        He desires. "Then he said, 'Here I am, God, to do what you
                        want me to do.' " Heb. 10:9, TEV.

THINK IT THROUGH           What is my attitude toward God and my life?
                           "From the creation the moral law was an essential part of
                        God's divine plan, and was as unchangeable as Himself. The
                        ceremonial law was to answer a particular purpose in Christ's
                        plan for the salvation of the race. The typical system of sacri-
                        fices and offerings was established that through these services
                        the sinner might discern the great offering, Christ. But the Jews
                        were so blinded by pride and sin that but few of them could
                        see farther than the death of beasts as an atonement for sin;
                        and when Christ, whom these offerings prefigured, came, they
                        could not discern Him."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bib!"

           Part 2       What sacrifice did God ask of Abraham?
         A LIVING
        SACRIFICE       "And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac,
                     whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and
         Gen. 22:2   offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains
                     which I will tell thee of."

                        Abraham was asked to sacrifice his son. He did not withhold
                     him. As far as Abraham was concerned he had sacrificed his
                     son; Isaac had been given. God did not actually take the gift,
                     for He knew Abraham's intentions and his attitude without
                     taking it. It was offered. It was accepted. It was ready to be
                     used. Abraham did not withhold his son. This demonstrated
                     that he would withhold nothing from God.

                        What sacrifice did Paul appeal to the believers in Rome
                     to make? Rom. 12:1.

                        Money alone has become the common denominator of sacri-
                     fice to most people today. Even in the church, money, instead
                     of Jesus, too often comes to the forefront of our thinking when
                     the word "sacrifice" is heard. Money is absolutely essential. It
                     must be sacrificed or yielded along with abilities, time, and
                     the body temple. Any of these given separately without the
                     others and without the correct attitude are not the gift God
                     desires from us. They are of significance only when they in-
                     dicate that the complete life has been yielded to God. God
                     seeks a living sacrifice.
                         We cannot atone for our sins. Why then does God call upon
                     us to be living sacrifices? It is an indication to Him that we
                     have accepted His gift of love and sacrifice, the gift of Himself,
                     in our behalf. It is a sign to Him that we have given ourselves
                     as a living sacrifice to Him. We have placed ourselves upon
                     the altar of sacrifice, living a life which meets His approval.

 THINK IT THROUGH       Am I a vibrant, optimistic, joyous, living sacrifice?

                        "In the words of Abraham, 'My son, God will provide Himself
                     a Iamb for a burnt offering' (Gen. 22:8), and in God's provision
                     of a sacrifice instead of Isaac, it was declared that no man
                     could make expiation for himself. The pagan system of sacri-
                     fice was wholly unacceptable to God. No father was to offer
                     up his son or his daughter for a sin offering. The Son of God
                     alone can bear the guilt of the world."—The Desire of Ages,

              Part 3   What instruction did Jesus give for one who would follow
        SELF-DENIAL Him?
         Matt. 16:24
                         "Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come
                     after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and
                     follow me."

                        "Christians who live for self dishonor their Redeemer. They
                     may apparently be very active in the service of the Lord, but
                     they weave self into all that they do. Sowing the seeds of
                     selfishness, they must at last reap a harvest of corruption. . . .
                     Service for self takes a variety of forms. Some of these forms
                     seem harmless. Apparent goodness gives them the appearance
                     of genuine goodness. But they bring no glory to the Lord. By
                     their service His cause is hindered. Christ says, 'He that is
                     not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me
                     scattereth abroad.'
                        "Those who bring self into their work cannot be trusted. If
                     they would lose sight of self in Christ, their efforts would be
                     of value to His cause. They would then conform the life to His
                     teachings. They would form their plans in harmony with His
                     great plan of love. Selfishness would be banished from their
                     efforts. . . . Self-denial, humility of mind, nobility of purpose,

                        "As we follow Him in the path of self-denial, lifting the cross
                     and bearing it after Him to His Father's home, we shall reveal
                     in our lives the beauty of the Christ life. At the altar of self-
                     sacrifice,—the appointed place of meeting between God and
                     the soul,—we receive from the hand of God the celestial torch

                        "Unselfish devotion and a spirit of sacrifice have always
                     been and always will be the first requisite of acceptable ser-

            Part 4       What answer did Jesus give to one who sought eternal
      PRACTICAL      life?
   APPLICATIONS        "And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master,
   Matt. 19:16, 21   what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?

                        "Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell
                     that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have
                     treasure in heaven: and come and follow me."

                         What sacrifices does God ask of you? He may ask of you
                     what He asked of the rich young ruler. You may be asked to
                     sell some or all of what you possess to support His cause.
                         Many people are willing to trade away eternity for temporary
                     life. God has given guides to teach us how to sacrifice and
                     where to begin sacrificing. Here is where to begin:
                         "Let the members of the church now put away their pride
                     and lay off their ornaments."—Counsels on Stewardship, page
                     291.
                         Next, lay aside useless and injurious things. Sacrifice by
                     depriving self of unnecessary gratification. Sacrifice hate, envy,
                     evil habits. Sacrifice sin! See Early Writings, pages 121, 122.
                         The next step is this: "But something more must be done
                     than merely to dispense with superfluities. Self-denial must be
                      practiced. Some of our comfortable and desirable things must
                      be sacrificed. The preachers must sharpen up their message,
                     not merely assailing self-indulgence, and pride in dress, but
                      presenting Jesus, His life of self-denial and sacrifice."—Coun-
                     sels on Stewardship, page 291.
                         It is easier now to understand that sacrifice is an attitude.
                      Consider the contrast between your home and one that was
                      near a carpenter's shop in Nazareth of Galilee.

 THINK IT THROUGH      Would I feel at ease with Jesus physically present in my
                     home? Why?

                          "If ever there was a time when sacrifices should be made,
                     it is now. My brethren and sisters, practice economy in your
                     homes. Put away the idols that you have placed before God.
                     Give up your selfish pleasures. Do not, I beg of you, spend
                     means embellishing your houses; for your money belongs to
                     God, and to Him you must give an account for its use. Do not
                     use the Lord's money to gratify the fancies of your children.
                      Teach them that God has a claim on all they possess, and that
                     nothing can ever cancel this claim. .
                          "If you have extravagant habits, cut them away from your
                      life at once. Unless you do this, you will be bankrupt for eter-

        TO SACRIFICE        "And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren,
       Matt. 19:29, 30   or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands,
                         for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall
                         inherit everlasting life. But many that are first shall be last;
                         and the last shall be first."

                             Is this the time of the end? Is it the time for Jesus to
                         return? Is it the time for a completed work? Then it is time
                         to sacrifice. Sacrifice time, abilities, money, the pleasures of
                         the body. It is time to have more than a spirit of liberality. It
                         is time to sacrifice for God and His cause. It will be easy or
                         difficult, depending on your attitude.

                             Whatever is not disposed of prior to the close of probation
                         will be of no use to the cause of God. What a sobering thought
                         this is! "I was shown that it is the will of God that the saints
                         should cut loose from every encumbrance before the time of
                         trouble comes, and make a covenant with God through sacri-

                         inquire of God for duty, He will teach them when to dispose
                         of these things....
                             "I saw that if any held on to their property, and did not
                         inquire of the Lord as to their duty, He would not make duty
                         known, and they would be permitted to keep their property,
                         and in the time of trouble it would come up before them like
                         a mountain to crush them, and they would try to dispose of
                         it, but would not be able."—Counsels on Stewardship, pages

                            "In redemption God has revealed His love in sacrifice, a

           Part 6       What was the real gift of the Macedonians?
         NOTHING
                       "And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their
        WITHHELD     own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God."
        2 Cor. 8:5
                        The Macedonians were following the example of Jesus
                     Christ in their giving. The cause of the people in Jerusalem
                     became their cause. They gave themselves as well as their
                     gifts to God. They withheld nothing. They were consecrated
                     and devoted followers of Jesus Christ, and as a result of this
                     consecration and devotion their spiritual and financial gifts
                     went out to those in need.
                         "It was not necessary to urge them to give; rather, they
                     rejoiced in the privilege of denying themselves even of neces-
                     sary things in order to supply the needs of others. When the
                     apostle would have restrained them, they importuned him to
                     accept their offering. In their simplicity and integrity, and in
                     their love for the brethren, they gladly denied self, and thus
                     abounded in the fruit of benevolence."—Counsels on Steward-
                     ship, page 172.
                         Sacrifice is not dealing primarily with how much you give
                     or do not give, but with how much you give in relation to how
                     much you have left. All, even yourself, is available to the One
                     you love and to your brethren everywhere. This is what it means
                     in Welfare Ministry, page 203, where it says that even the poor
                     are to sacrifice. They are not forced or compelled to do so.
                     They cannot be prevented from doing so. Sacrifice becomes a
                     pleasure and a delight.

                        What is the ultimate sacrifice? John 15:13.

 THINK IT THROUGH        What evidence is there in my experience that I have the
                     faith to trust God with my entire life?

                        "It is the heart service that makes the gift valuable. When
                     the Majesty of heaven became a babe, and was entrusted to
                     Mary, she did not have much to offer for the precious gift. She
                     brought to the altar only two turtledoves, the offering ap-
                     pointed for the poor; but they were an acceptable sacrifice to
                     the Lord. She could not present rare treasures such as the
                     wise men of the East came to Bethlehem to lay before the Son
                     of God; yet the mother of Jesus was not rejected because of
                     the smallness of her gift. It was the willingness of her heart
                     that the Lord looked upon, and her love made the offering
                     sweet. So God will accept our gift, however small, if it is the
                     best we have, and is offered from love to Him."—Counsels on

           Part 1      What claim did God make upon all that Israel acquired?
       THE TITHE       "And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the
  RETURNED FIRST    land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the Lord's: it is holy unto
       Lev. 27:30   the Lord."
                       God has never disclaimed this principle. He still claims as
                    His own the first 10 percent of all He gives us or helps us to
                    acquire. It is reserved by God for His own purposes. Man does
                    not give the tithe to God as a gift. It already belongs to God.
                       "'Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse' (Malachi 3:10),
                    is God's command. No appeal is made to gratitude or to gen-
                    erosity. This is a matter of simple honesty. The tithe is the
                    Lord's; and He bids us return to Him that which is His own."
                    —Education, pages 138, 139.

                       When is the tithe to be returned? Prov. 3:9, 10.

                        The returning of God's tithe comes first. "Let each regularly
                    examine his income, which is all a blessing from God, and
                    set apart the tithe as a separate fund, to be sacredly the
                    Lord's. This fund should not in any case be devoted to any
                    other use; it is to be devoted solely to support the ministry of
                    the gospel. After the tithe is set apart, let gifts and offerings
                    be apportioned, 'as God hath prospered' you."—Counsels on
                    Stewardship, page 81.
                        "Not only does the Lord claim the tithe as His own, but He
                    tells us how it should be reserved for Him. He says, 'Honor the
                    Lord with thy substance, and with the first fruits of all thine in-
                    crease.' This does not teach that we are to spend our means
                    on ourselves, and bring to the Lord the remnant, even though
                    it should be otherwise an honest tithe. Let God's portion be first
                    set apart."—Counsels on Stewardship, page 81.

 THINK IT THROUGH      In what ways do I need to correct my record of tithing?

                        "That which has been set apart according to the Scriptures
                    as belonging to the Lord, constitutes the revenue of the gospel
                    and is no longer ours. It is no better than sacrilege for a man
                    to take from God's treasury in order to serve himself or to serve
                    others in their secular business. . . . All should regard this
                    matter in the right light. Let no one, when brought into a strait
                    place, take money consecrated to religious purposes and use
                    it for his advantage, soothing his conscience by saying that he
                    will repay it at some future time. Far better cut down the ex-
                    penses to correspond with the income, to restrict the wants,

             Part 2       What guide for giving did Paul give to the Corinthian
        GUIDES FOR     believers?
       OFFERINGS, I       "Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay
         1 Cor. 16:2   by him in store, as God hath prospered him, that there be
                       no gatherings when I come."

                            The tithe is not an offering. If a person returns the tithe, he
                       is being honest, but he is not giving God anything. It is only
                       after we return the tithe that we begin to give.
                           How much offering shall I give? This is a question frequently
                       asked about giving. The answer is to give as God has made
                       it possible for you to give. No one can tell you what is the
                       correct amount for you to give.
                           There were at least fourteen offerings instituted by God in
                       ancient Israel for religious and charitable purposes. Some
                       were in force among God's people before Israel was a nation.
                       However, the spirit of prophecy summarizes the combined
                       amount of these offerings for religious and charitable purposes
                       and reveals the percentage they amounted 10.
                           It is not the purpose in noting these guides to set up a
                        criterion that all must follow. The circumstances of believers
                        vary greatly, and each one must be persuaded for himself what
                       his duty is in stewardship. On the other hand, it is appropriate
                       to note both the requirements of God and the liberality of His
                       people in ages past; and while this information does not impose
                       a requirement on us today, it can give us perspective in ex-
                       amining our stewardship.
                            "To promote the assembling of the people for religious ser-
                        vice, as well as to provide for the poor, a second tithe of all
                       the increase was required. . . . This tithe, or its equivalent in
                       money, they were for two years to bring to the place where
                       the sanctuary was established. After presenting a thank offer-
                       ing to God, and a specified portion to the priest, the offerers
                       were to use the remainder for a religious feast, in which the
                       Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow should par-
                       ticipate. Thus provision was made for the thank offerings and
                       feasts at the yearly festivals, and the people were drawn to
                       the society of the priests and Levites, that they' might receive
                       instruction and encouragement in the service of God."—Pa-

THINK IT THROUGH          What is my reaction to giving to the poor? Is it Christlike?

                          "The Christian will be filled with joy in proportion as he is
                       a faithful steward of his Lord's goods."—Counsels on Steward-

           Part 3       By what has God ordained that His work be sustained?
      GUIDES FOR
                        "Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye
     OFFERINGS, II   say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings."
         Mal. 3:8
                         Tithes and offerings constitute God's plan for sustaining His
                     work. To refuse to return His tithe and give equitable offerings
                     incurs His disfavor and pronouncement of robbery. Robbery
                     is involved in withholding offerings as well as tithe. "The con-
                     tributions required of the Hebrews for religious and charitable
                     purposes amounted to fully one-fourth of their income. So
                     heavy a tax upon the resources of the people might be ex-
                     pected to reduce them to poverty; but, on the contrary, the
                     faithful observance of these regulations was one of the condi-
                     tions of their prosperity."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 527.
                         Ellen G. White further writes: "When we speak of the tithe
                     as the standard of the Jewish contributions to religious pur-
                     poses, we do not speak understandingly. The Lord kept His
                     claims paramount, and in almost every article they were re-
                      minded of the Giver by being required to make returns to Him.
                      They were required to pay a ransom for their firstborn son, for
                      the first fruits of their flocks, and for the first gathering of the
                      harvest. They were required to leave the corners of their har-
                      vest fields for the destitute. Whatever dropped from their
                      hands in reaping was left for the poor, and once in every seven
                      years their lands were allowed to produce spontaneously for
                      the needy. Then there were the sacrificial offerings, the tres-
                      pass offerings, the sin offerings, and the remission of all debts
                      every seventh year. There were also numerous expenses for
                      hospitalities and gifts to the poor, and there were assessments
                      upon their property.
                          "At stated periods, in order to preserve the integrity of the
                      law, the people were interviewed as to whether they had faith-
                      fully performed their vows or not. A conscientious few made
                      returns to God of about one-third of all their income for the
                      benefit of religious interests and for the poor. These exactions
                      were not from a particular class of the people, but from all,
                      the requirement being proportioned according to the amount
                      possessed."—Testimonies, Vol. 4, p. 467.

 THINK IT THROUGH        Is my conscience stricken when I rob God?

                         "There must be an awakening among us as a people upon
                     this matter. There are but few men who feel conscience stricken
                     if they neglect their duty in beneficence. But few feel remorse-
                     ful of soul because they are daily robbing God."—Counsels on

        GUIDES FOR        "Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the
      OFFERINGS, III   excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for
           Phil. 3:8   whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count
                       them but dung, that I may win Christ."

                          "All things. In v. 7 Paul says that he counted the things
                       previously mentioned as loss. In this verse he goes further
                       and declares that all things are counted loss. He is ready to
                       renounce not only the things he had specified but everything
                       that could be imagined. If all the wealth and honor conceivable
                       were his, he would cheerfully repudiate them that he might
                       know Christ."—SDA Bible Commentary, on Phil. 3:8.
                          "Before he became a disciple of Christ, Paul had occupied
                       a high position and was not dependent upon manual labor for
                       support. But afterward, when he had used all his means in
                       furthering the cause of Christ, he resorted at times to his
                       trade to gain a livelihood. Especially was this the case when
                       he labored in places where his motives might have been mis-
                       understood."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 347.

                          How were funds provided for construction of the taber-
                       nacle? Ex. 35:29; 36:6, 7.

                           "The murmurings of the Israelites and the visitations of
                       God's judgments because of their sins are recorded as a
                       warning to after-generations. And their devotion, their zeal
                       and liberality, are an example worthy of imitation. All who
                       love the worship of God and prize the blessing of His sacred
                       presence will manifest the same spirit of sacrifice in preparing
                       a house where He may meet with them. They will desire to
                       bring to the Lord an offering of the very best that they possess.
                       A house built for God should not be left in debt, for He is
                       thereby dishonored. An amount sufficient to accomplish the
                       work should be freely given, that the workmen may be able to
                       say, as did the builders of the tabernacle, 'Bring no more
                       offerings.' "—Patriarchs and Prophets, pages 344-347.

                       providing luxurious food; but in everything let us think of the
                       souls for whom Christ has died. Let selfishness and pride die."

God's Guides for Stewardship LESSON 12                                  D Thursday
                                                                        December 20

     LIVING TRUST
        Luke 14:33
                         "So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not
                     all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple."



                         Discipleship involves placing everything on the altar—plans,
                     possessions, riches, and relatives. Nothing is to stand between
                     a person and his Lord.
                         For man's own spiritual welfare, God's guides for steward-
                     ship do not stop at any particular percentage.
                         "He deserves the whole heart, the property, all that they
                     have and are. But many professed Christians put off the claims
                     of Jesus in life, and insult Him by giving Him a mere pittance
                     at death.
                         "Let all of this class remember that this robbery of God is
                     not an impulsive action, but a well-considered plan which
                     they preface by saying, 'Being in sound mind.' After having
                     defrauded the cause of God through life, they perpetuate the
                     fraud after death. And this is with the full consent of all the
                     powers of the mind."—Counsels on Stewardship, pages 326,
                     327.
                         God's guides for giving may include a will or a trust, but
                     it is to be a living trust, working for God even while we still
                     live. "And it should be distinctly understood that because par-
                     ents have made their will, this will not prevent them from giving
                     means to the cause of God while they live. This they should
                     do. They should have the satisfaction here, and‘the,, reward

              Part 6       Are there lessons for us to learn from the children of Israel?
      THESE GUIDES
       APPLY TODAY
        1 Cor. 10:11       "Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples:
                       and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends
                       of the world are come."



                           One of God's purposes in providing Israel with guidelines
                       for giving was to teach them and, when applicable, to warn
                       them not to trust in their own strength or wisdom. We today
                       cannot return a substantial percentage of our income to God
                        without His direct blessing any more than families in Israel
                        could. It takes as much faith now as then.
                           One may wonder if these guidelines apply today. Through
                       the spirit of prophecy directed specifically to His people today
                       comes God's positive answer. Consider carefully His words to
                       you.
                           After the death of Jesus the gospel message expanded rap-
                       idly. God had already provided a plan for its financial support.
                       The plan was used prior to Israel, then by Israel, by the early
                       church, and it is in force today. "The gospel, extending and
                       widening, required greater provisions to sustain the warfare
                       after the death of Christ, and this made the law of almsgiving
                       a more urgent necessity than under the Hebrew government.
                       Now God requires, not less, but greater gifts than at any other
                       period of the world."—Testimonies, Vol. 3, p. 392.
                          In reference to spiritual Israel, or the church of today, God
                       says: "There are even more urgent necessities upon the Israel
                       of God in these last days than were upon ancient Israel. There
                       is a great and important work to be accomplished in a very
                       short time."—Testimonies, Vol. 3, p. 396.
                          Again God urges that more, not less, be given and explains
                       why. "In the days of Israel the tithe and freewill offerings were
                       needed to maintain the ordinances of divine service. Should
                       the people of God give less in this age?"—Patriarchs and
                       Prophets, page 528.

THINK IT THROUGH          How can I determine my stewardship requirements?



                         "God requires no less of us than He required of His people

                                                                     December 26

           Part 4      Does man's faith originate with man or with God?
    GIFT OF FAITH      "For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man
        Rom. 12:3   that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than
                    he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath
                    dealt to every man the measure of faith."

                       "The Spirit operating upon and enlightening the human
                    mind, creates faith in God. In the Scriptures faith is stated to
                    be the gift of God, powerful unto salvation, enlightening the
                    hearts of those who search for truth as for hidden treasure. The
                    Spirit of God impresses the truth on the heart. The gospel is
                    called the power of God unto salvation because God alone can
                    make the truth a power which sanctifies the soul. He alone
                    can render the cross of Christ triumphant."—Ellen G. White
                    Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 7, p. 940.

                      What is the kind of faith that avails for righteousness?
                    Gal. 5:6.
                       "Genuine faith always works by love. When you look to
                    Calvary it is not to quiet your soul in the nonperformance of
                    duty, not to compose yourself to sleep, but to create faith in
                    Jesus, faith that will work, purifying the soul from the slime
                    of selfishness. When we lay hold of Christ by faith, our work
                    has just begun....
                        "The labor of love springs from the work of faith. Bible
                    religion means constant work. 'Let your light so shine before
                    men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your
                    Father which is in heaven.' Work out your own salvation with
                    fear and trembling, for it is God that worketh in you, both to
                    will and to do of his good pleasure.' We are to be zealous of
                    good works; be careful to maintain good works. And the true
                    Witness says, 'I know thy works.'
                        "While it is true that our busy activities will not in them-
                    selves ensure salvation, it is also true that faith which unites
                    us to Christ will stir the soul to activity."—Ellen G. White
                    Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 6, p. 1111.

 THINK IT THROUGH       What is the evidence that my faith is genuine?

                        "It is not enough to believe about Christ; we must believe
                    in Him. The only faith that will benefit us is that which em-
                    braces Him as a personal Saviour; which appropriates His
                    merits to ourselves. Many hold faith as an opinion. But saving
                    faith is a transaction, by which those who receive Christ join
                    themselves in covenant relation with God. Genuine faith is life."

                                                                           December 27


              Part 5      "For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eter-
            GIFT OF    nal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."
        ETERNAL LIFE       "Physical life is something which each individual receives.
           Rom. 6:23   It is not eternal or immortal; for God, the Life-giver, takes it
                       again. Man has no control over his life. But the life of Christ
                       was unborrowed. No one can take this life from Him. 'I lay it
                       down of myself' (John 10:18), He said. In Him was life, original,
                       unborrowed, underived. This life is not inherent in man. He can
                       possess it only through Christ. He cannot earn it; it is given
                       him as a free gift if he will believe in Christ as his personal
                       Saviour. 'This is life eternal, that they might know thee the
                       only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent' (John
                       17:3). This is the open fountain of life for the world."—Selected
                       Messages, Bk. 1, pp. 296, 297.
                           What two elements combine to procure for man the gift
                       of salvation? Eph. 2:8.
                          "Only the believer in Christ can receive life everlasting.
                       Only by continually feeding on Christ's flesh and blood can we
                       have the assurance that we are partakers of the divine nature.
                       No one should be indifferent on this subject, saying, If we are
                       honest, it is no matter what we believe. You cannot with safety
                       surrender any seed of vital truth in order to please yourself or
                       anybody else. Do not seek to avoid the cross. If we receive
                       no light from the Sun of Righteousness, we have no connec-
                       tion with the Source of all light; and if this life and light do not
                       abide in us, we can never be saved.
                          "God has made every provision that His purpose in the
                       creation of man shall not be frustrated by Satan. After Adam
                       and Eve brought death into the world by their disobedience, a
                       costly sacrifice was provided for the human race. A higher
                       value than that they originally possessed was placed upon
                       them. By giving Christ, His only-begotten Son, as a ransom for
                       the world, God gave all heaven."—Selected Messages, Bk. 1,
                       p.299.

THINK IT THROUGH          What is my personal relationship to Jesus and His gift of
                       eternal life?
                            "We should not make self the center and indulge anxiety
                       and fear as to whether we shall be saved. All this turns the soul
                       away from the Source of our strength. Commit the keeping of
                       your soul to God, and trust in Him. Talk and think of Jesus.
                       Let self be lost in Him. Put away all doubt; dismiss your fears.
                       . . . [Galatians 2:20 quoted.] If you will leave yourself in His
                       hands, He will bring you off more than conqueror through Him
                       that has loved you."—Steps to Christ, page 72.

God's Gifts LESSON 13                                                    ❑ Friday
                                                                       December 28

            Part 6      What response to salvation does Paul counsel the Colos-
       GRATITUDE     sians to make?
      Col. 1:12-14      "Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet
                     to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light: . . .
                     in whom we have redemption through his blood, even the
                     forgiveness of sins."

                         All that God has given us is by grace—undeserved. Christ's
                     incarnation and sacrifice, the Holy Spirit, our faith in Jesus, and
                     eternal life are all gifts of grace. The only reasonable attitude
                     toward God for His gifts of grace is humility by which one
                     recognizes his unworthiness and responds with gratitude.
                         "He who feels his own weakness will look higher than him-
                     self and will feel the need of constant strength from above.
                     The grace of God will lead him to exercise and cherish a spirit
                     of constant gratitude. He who is best acquainted with his own
                     weakness will know that it is the matchless grace of God alone
                     that will triumph over the rebellion of the heart."—Testimonies,
                     Vol. 3, pp. 321, 322.
                         "The mercies of God surround you every moment; and it
                      would be profitable for you to consider how and whence your
                      blessings come every day. Let the precious blessings of God
                     awaken gratitude in you. You cannot number the blessings of
                      God, the c6nstant loving-kindness expressed to you, for they
                      are as numerous as the refreshing drops of rain. Clouds of
                      mercy are hanging over you, and ready to drop upon you. If
                      you will appreciate the valuable gift of salvation, you will be
                      sensible of daily refreshment, of the protection and love of
                      Jesus; you will be guided in the way of peace."—Messages
                     to Young People, pages 409, 410.

 THINK IT THROUGH      Does my gratitude equal my blessings? How do I express
                     my gratitude?

                        "All our blessings come from His bountiful hand. In turn
                     He would have men and women show their gratitude by return-
                     ing Him a portion in tithes and offerings—in thank offerings, in
                     freewill offerings, in trespass offerings."—Testimonies, Vol.
                     5, p. 150.
                         "Shall not the recipients of His blessings show their grati-
                     tude by giving of their means to help suffering humanity?"—
                     Testimonies, Vol. 9, p. 50.
                         "God permits us to show our appreciation of His mercies
                     by self-sacrificing efforts to extend the same to others. This is
                     the only way in which it is possible for us to manifest our
                      gratitude and love to God. He has provided no other."—Coun-
