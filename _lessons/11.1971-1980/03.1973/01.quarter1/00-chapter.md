     THIRTEENTH SABBATH OVERFLOW OFFERING
    MARCH 31, 1973, NORTHERN EUROPE-WEST AFRICA DIVISION
   The Thirteenth Sabbath Offering is a living symbol of the globe-encircling
unity of the advent movement. This quarter the overflow offering is going
to the Northern Europe-West Africa Division—a considerable section of
the world field, reaching from Greenland's icy mountains and Ireland's
troubled homes and streets to Poland's golden autumns and West Africa's
teeming millions.
   Education is at a premium in West Africa. Its youth are on the march;
tens of thousands are being trained in Adventist schools. At the top of
the church's educational ladder is found the Adventist College of West
Africa. Here eager young people are being channeled into lines of denomina-
tional service. We are endeavoring to build up a real senior college. The
opportunities are challenging. Your support is needed to make the college
a key Adventist center of learning and spiritual vivification. Your offering
will help construct a badly needed assembly hall.
   Stanborough School is the secondary school serving Britain. Plans have
been made calling for a great forward leap. Your giving will help provide
additional classrooms and dormitory facilities.
   March 31 is a red-letter date in the Adventist Church calendar. God loves
a cheerful giver. "The very best manner . . . to give expression to our
love for our Redeemer is to make offerings to bring souls to the knowledge
of the truth."—Testimonies, Vol. 3, p. 413.
   Our liberality will help to produce spiritual and educational reality.

  The Christian and Communication


                       FIRST QUARTER, 1973




   These lessons are about the way Christians communicate with each
other, with the world, and with God. They have to do with the two-way
channels of communication—how they affect Christians as they
receive communications from others, and how their own communica-
tions affect other people.
   Effective communication is the most difficult of all human arts.
Research indicates that in some countries people spend about 75
percent of their time in one or more acts of communication. People
all over the world, both civilized and primitive, spend much time either
in communicating actively or in receiving communication by listening.
   God has designed effective ways of restoring communication
between Himself and mankind since the direct link was severed in
Eden. He speaks to the human family through prayer, through the
Bible, through nature, by song, and in many other ways. "Each is
to have an individual experience in being taught by the Great Teacher,
and individual communion with God ."—Testimonies to Ministers,
page 486.
   The Scripture says that "they that feared the Lord spake often one
 to another." Mal. 3:16. A Christian who fails to join in communication
 with fellow Christians soon loses strength in his spiritual life. We
find Christian communication in books and magazines, through radio
and television, by telephone and letter, as well as in the church, in
the school, and in family worship.
   A world awaits the Christian who believes the divine command
 to communicate the gospel. To him are given ways both simple and
 complex. A simple, effective witness of Christian living may be all
 that is possible in a particular circumstance; or, in other circum-
 stances, modern communications technology may be effectively
 employed to answer a global challenge.
   At all times and by all means we must be ready to communicate
 the good word Heaven has given us through Jesus Christ.
The Blessing of Daily Study
  "Every day some portion of time should be appro-
priated to the study of the lessons, not merely in learn-
ing to mechanically repeat the words, while the mind
does not comprehend the meaning; but to go to the
very foundation, and become familiar with what is
brought out in the lesson."—Counsels on Sabbath
School Work, page 53.




                     My Pledge
  As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge
of the Scriptures, I pledge myself to the careful and
prayerful study of some portion of my Sabbath School
lesson each day of the week.

              Part 1    What is the meaning of Paul's illustration of writing on the

          A LETTER
       2 Cor. 3:2, 3   "Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read
                     of all men: forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the
                     epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with
                     the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy
                     tables of the heart."
                        "Our epistle. Paul now uses the word 'epistle' figuratively. He
                     had no need of literal introductory letters, for his converts were
                     an all-sufficient proof of his apostleship. He needed no written
                     documents to establish his apostolic authority. The metaphor of
                     a written letter signifies both that the Corinthian believers had
                     the word and law of God written on their hearts and that they
                     were living epistles written on Paul's heart. The first constituted
                     evidence that they were true Christians, and the second that Paul
                     was a true apostle. They were the 'seal' of his 'apostleship' (1
                     Cor. 9:2). . . .
                        "Epistle of Christ. Each believer and each church should be
                     a letter from Christ to the world. The author of the letter is Christ.
                     The material on which the writing is done is the heart of each
                     believer, and that which is written is the law of God, a transcript
                     of His character."—SDA Bible Commentary, on 2 Cor. 3:2, 3.
                       What relationship is established as God writes on our hearts?
                     Heb. 8:10.

                        Such a relationship as this makes the Christian life a powerful
                     witness. A letter must first be written, then it must be made available
                     to the recipient. The world needs the enlightening witness of born-
                     again Christians.
                        We communicate our attitudes and beliefs to others not just
                     through our words, but through our dress, our bodies, the way
                     we stand. "Every action is to be a consecrated action, for it
                     occupies God's entrusted talent of time. Holiness unto the Lord
                     is inscribed on all the actions of such a one, because his whole
                     being is brought under subjection to God."—Ellen G. White Com-
                     ments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 6, p. 1087.

THINK IT THROUGH       What is written on my heart? Do you think the work would
                     be nearer to its close if we made the writing more accessible
                     for others to read?

                        "If you are Christ's follower, He sends in you a letter to the
                     family, the village, the street, where you live. Jesus, dwelling in
                     you, desires to speak to the hearts of those who are not acquainted
                     with Him. Perhaps they do not read the Bible, or do not hear
                     the voice that speaks to them in its pages; they do not see the
                     love of God through His works. But if you are a true representative-
                     of Jesus, it may be that through you they will be led to understand
                     something of His goodness and be won to love and serve Him."

                      "Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do
                    all to the glory of God. Give none offence, neither to the Jews,
                    nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God: even as I please
                    all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit
                    of many, that they may be saved."
                       "The Christian's first motive in living in harmony with the laws
                    of God should be to promote the honor of God. This motive arises
                    from his love for God and his desire to please his Maker (see
                    John 14:15; 1 John 5:3). All the energies of the soul should be
                    used to advance the interests of God's kingdom, and so to honor
                    God. . . .
                       "Christians are not at liberty to follow the promptings of the
                    natural, unconverted heart and the impulses of the unregenerate
                    body. They are under obligation to bring every thought, word,
                    and deed into harmony with God's revealed will."—SDA Bible
                    Commentary, on 1 Cor. 10:31.

                    58:6-8. Does this passage have significance today?

                      Today, because of the widespread use of mass media, our acts
                    as individuals and as a church can very rapidly be subjected to
                    the scrutiny of the world. We live as a part of a global community.
                    Our presence, or absence, in times of need tells the world of
                    our concern or lack of it.
                      What is Christ's assessment of the deeds of His professed
                    followers? Matt. 25:31-46.


THINK IT THROUGH      How would Jesus assess my actions of the past year in relation
                    to the message they have communicated to others? How may
                    this record be improved?

                      "The universe of heaven will look upon characters [of converted

                    level will be forsaken, and their feet will be placed upon the first
                    round of the ladder, which is Christ Jesus. They will mount step
                    by step, one round after another, heavenward. Christ will be

                      "Everyone will be held responsible for the grace given him
                    through Christ. Life is too solemn to be absorbed in temporal
                    or earthly matters. The Lord desires that we shall communicate

     Acts 13:42, 43 Barnabas: who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue
                    in the grace of God."
                      Nothing persuades quite so completely as words spoken with
                   complete sincerity, love, and concern. In this text we are reading
                   about the preaching of Paul and Barnabas, but the words of any
                   of Christ's followers may achieve effectiveness when backed by
                   complete belief in their truth and the witness of a converted life.
                      "Of all the fair graces and virtues that are important, I think
                   sincerity is the queen of them all. It is the virtue the human heart
                   instinctively craves and hopes for. And yet how common is insin-
                   cerity. What a miserable old humbug of a world we are living
                   in—full of trickery, dishonesty, and deceit of every kind. We say
                   what we do not mean; we express emotions we do not feel; we
                   praise when we secretly condemn; we smile when we have a frown
                   in our heart; we strive so often to make people think we are other
                   than we are."—Paul C. Heubach, This Is Life, page 174.
                      What should characterize our speech? Eph. 4:15.


                       Words spoken in love will never hurt or destroy. They will have
                    true persuasive power.

                    How does Solomon illustrate the beauty of carefully chosen
                   words? Prov. 25:11.

                    The books of Proverbs and James both include counsel about
                   words. Words are the basic materials of language communication.

                   fresh water? What does the illustration teach about speech?



                     "There are few who realize how far-reaching is the influence
                   of their words and acts. How often the errors of parents produce
                   the most disastrous effects upon their children and children's
                   children, long after the actors themselves have been laid in the
                   grave. Everyone is exerting an influence upon others, and will
                   be held accountable for the result of that influence. Words and
                   actions have a telling power, and the long hereafter will show
                   the effect of our life here. The impression made by our words
                   and deeds will surely react upon ourselves in blessing or in cursing.
                   This thought gives an awful solemnity to life, and should draw
                   us to God in humble prayer that He will guide us by His wisdom."—

                      "The Bible shows us God in His high and holy place. . . . By
                   His Spirit He is everywhere present. Through the agency of His
                   Spirit and His angels He ministers to the children of men. "— The
                   Ministry of Healing, page 417.
                      Our whole I ives are affected by prayer. It moves us in the direction
                   of God. It opens our hearts to heaven's communications. Through
                   it we understand God's will for us.
                      What gift comes through prayer? Luke 11:13.

                      We are told to knock and it shall be opened, to seek and so
                   find. The primary gift available through prayer is the gift of the
                   Holy Spirit, the personal representative of Jesus Christ. If we are
                   to be channels for the flow of God's love to others, the Spirit
                   must enter our lives daily in response to our earnest prayer request.

                      What is Christ seeking to do? Rev. 3:20. How does this form
                    a counterpart to Luke 11:9-13?


THINK IT THROUGH      How will prayer help us to communicate God's will to others?

                        "The dispensation in which we are now living is to be, to those
                    that ask, the dispensation of the Holy Spirit. Ask for His blessing.
                    It is time we were more intense in our devotion. To us is committed
                    the arduous, but happy, glorious work of revealing Christ to those
                    who are in darkness. We are called to proclaim the special truths
                    for this time. For all this the outpouring of the Spirit is essential.
                    We should pray for it. The Lord expects us to ask Him. We have

                        "Pray without ceasing, and watch by working in accordance

             Part 5     What is Paul's suggestion as to the way money or possessions
     OUR MEANS— should be used?
      A SOURCE OF
         BLESSING       "Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not
     1 Tim. 6:17-19 highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God,
                     who giveth us richly all things to enjoy; that they do good, that
                     they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to com-
                     municate; laying up in store for themselves a good foundation
                     against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal
                     life."
                      Through our possession of worldly goods God tells us of His
                    love and concern, of our talents and responsibilities. Thus He
                    reminds us that all things are His.
                      Wealth is a way of speaking for God. We say that "money talks."
                    We might well ask ourselves the question, What is our money
                    saying about us? Does it speak of luxurious living or of self-
                    sacrifice? One's talent of money may provide the facilities whereby
                    another's talent for preaching or writing the gospel may reach
                    a greatly increased audience.

                      What message about the true God did Solomon's wealth com-
                     municate to the queen of Sheba? 1 Kings 10:1-13.
                        "By the time of the close of her visit the queen had been so
                     fully taught by Solomon as to the source of his wisdom and pros-
                     perity that she was constrained, not to extol the human agent,
                     but to exclaim, 'Blessed be the Lord thy God.' . . . This is the
                     impression that God designed should be made upon all peoples."
                     —Prophets and Kings, page 67.
                       What later experiences of Solomon's reveal that his heart
                     became closed to divine counsel? 1 Kings 11:1-13.

                        Undoubtedly Solomon's wealth led him into temptation. Money,
                     intellectual greatness, positions of power, many and varied tal-
                     ents—these are all agencies that may be either channels for divine
                     light or channels of self-serving.

THINK IT THROUGH       Why does God desire us to use our material wealth to advance
                     His purposes?

                      "Some of the men of experience and piety, who led out in this
                    work, who denied self and did not hesitate to sacrifice for its
                    success, are now sleeping in the grave. They were God's appointed
                    channels, His representative men, through whom the principles
                    of spiritual life were communicated to the church....
                      "The believers who in the early history of the cause sacrificed
                    for the upbuilding of the work were imbued with the same spirit.
                    They felt that God demanded of all connected with His cause
                    an unreserved consecration of body, soul, and spirit, of all their
                    energies and capabilities, to make the work a success."—

        WITNESS you."
        Phil. 4:9
                     Paul invites Christians to emulate his life as it was communicated
                  to them in various ways. Years before, he spoke of the decision
                  of God to use him, "when it pleased God. . . to reveal his Son
                  in me, that I might preach him among the heathen." Gal. 1:15,
                  16. He could, in humility, point selfward and invite emulation
                  because he lived to reveal the Son of God.
                     "By beholding we are to become changed, and as we meditate
                  upon the perfections of our divine Model, we shall desire to
                  become wholly transformed and renewed in the image of His pur-
                  ity. There will be a hungering and thirsting of soul to be made
                  like Him whom we adore. The more our thoughts are upon Christ,
                  the more we shall speak of Him to others, and represent Him
                  to the world."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Com-
                  mentary, Vol. 3, p. 1145.
                     What are the characteristics of the lives of those who accept
                   the three angels' messages? Rev. 14:12; compare 22:14.

                      The word "keep" in Rev. 14:12 implies a wholehearted commit-
                    ment to obedience and the following of Christ. In a world where
                    sin has distorted morality to the extent that evil appears right,
                    God's people stand as a bulwark against iniquity.
                      What result will come from the life that communicates Christ
                    and Christian principles? 1 Peter 2:11, 12; Matt. 5:16.


THINK IT THROUGH       In a world which sets subjective standards, how can the Chris-
                    tian live by an objective standard of purity, honesty, and obedi-
                    ence to God's will?



                      "The final response to the challenge of time's last hour will
                   be a life. Nothing in this world can replace a life. And nothing
                   in the Advent Movement can replace a life fully and entirely conse-
                   crated to the Advent message and to the Advent program. No
                   method, no talent, no plan, no means, can be considered as a
                   substitute. My brethren, a life that flashes out in Christian purity
                   will meet the challenge of immorality today.
                      "The present flagrant situation of immorality—and of dishonesty
                   in all its aspects—is causing grave uneasiness among the thinking
                   men and women of the world... .
                      "Can God ask anything less in His service than a life that shines
                   out of our eyes, out of our gestures, out of our attitudes, out
                   of our words—a living, burning life for Christ? That is the supreme
                   argument for Christianity and for the Advent message. This is
                   the only adequate response to time's last challenge—a life."—

                                                                           January 7
           Part 1      "Give ear, 0 my people, to my law: incline your ears to the
       THE EARS words of my mouth. I will open my mouth in a parable: I will
     Ps. 78:1-3, 5 utter dark sayings of old: which we have heard and known, and
                    our fathers have told us."
                       "For he [God] established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed
                    a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should
                    make them known to their children."
                      God's plea is that we listen. What a difference it would make
                   if God's people listened to His voice! The long list of God's wonder-
                   ful deeds in this psalm encourage faith and confidence.
                      Every day we listen to many voices. Radio, television, hi-fi, and
                   telephone blare their communications at us. Not only do we have
                   the responsibility of censoring what we hear, but we must also
                   make way for the words God wishes to speak to us through His
                   Word, through prayer, and through the guidance of the Holy Spirit.

                     How did Jesus invite His followers to make intelligent use
                   of their ears? Matt. 11:15; 13:9. See Rev. 3:22.

                     Many of the amusements popular in the world today, even with
                   those who claim to be Christians, tend to the same end as did
                   those of the heathen. There are indeed few among them that
                   Satan does not turn to account in destroying souls. Through the
                   drama he has worked for ages to excite passion and glorify vice.
                   The opera, with its fascinating display and bewildering music,
                   the masquerade, the dance, the card table, Satan employs to break
                   down the barriers of principle•and open the door to sensual
                   indulgence."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pages 459, 460.

THINK IT THROUGH      What voice should we seek to discern in the babble of impres-
                    sions we cannot escape? Isa. 30:21; John 14:26.


                     "Yet we have a work to do to resist temptation. Those who
                   would not fall a prey to Satan's devices must guard well the
                   avenues of the soul; they must avoid reading, seeing, or hearing
                   that which will suggest impure thoughts. The mind should not
                   be left to wander at random upon every subject that the adversary
                   of souls may suggest. 'Gird up the loins of your mind,' says the
                   apostle Peter, 'be sober, ... not fashioning yourselves according
                   to the former lusts in your ignorance: but as He which hath called
                   you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of living.' "—Messages
                   to Young People, page 285.
                      "The mind does not come down at once from purity and holiness
                   to depravity, corruption, and crime. It takes time to degrade those
                   formed in the image of God to the brutal or the satanic. By behold-
                   ing, we become changed. By the indulgence of impure thoughts,
                   man can so educate his mind that sin which he once loathed
                   will become pleasant to him."—Messages to Young People, page

Avenues to the Soul       LESSON 2                                         ❑ Monday
                                                                            January 8
           Part 2     What do you think Jesus meant by plucking out the eye?
       THE EYES
       Matt. 5:29
                      "And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from
                    thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should
                    perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell."
                      This is an alarming warning of the danger of being polluted
                    spiritually by our senses. The figure of speech used here graphi-
                    cally represents how great is the evil of opening the mind to lustful
                    impressions through the eyes. But lust is only one example of
                    the danger which includes a mental acceptance of every type
                    of sin that reaches the mind through the eye. These impressions
                    come not only from direct sight of persons, the source Jesus
                    was speaking of in Matt. 5:29, but also from print, cinema, and
                    television.
                      The eye receives countless communications in one day. The
                    mind is called upon to receive and classify these impressions.
                      What criteria should the Christian apply to what he permits
                    to enter his mind? Phil. 4:8. Compare Ps. 66:18; 101:3.


                       The eye must be controlled by faith—a faith that, voluntarily
                    received, has made the mind captive to Jesus Christ. Thus faith
                    in Jesus, working through the mind, may control all human senses.
                    Paul taught that anything which does not proceed out of faith
                    is sin. Rom. 14:23. To avoid sinning with the eyes, then, is a matter
                    of faith censoring sight. The Christian will choose sight objects
                    that are in harmony with the principles exhibited by the life of
                    Jesus.

THINK IT THROUGH       Do the circumstances of viewing alter the rightness of what
                    is viewed? Think about this in relation to watching television,
                    feature films, drama.


                       "You love to read storybooks, but do not find the word of God
                    interesting. You should restrict your reading to the word of God
                    and to books that are of a spiritual and useful character. In so
                    doing you will close a door against temptation, and you will be
                    blessed."—Testimonies, Vol. 3, pp. 81, 82.
                       "There is no influence in our land more powerful to poison
                    the imagination, to destroy religious impressions, and to blunt
                    the relish for the tranquil pleasures and sober realities of life than
                    theatrical amusements. The love for these scenes increases with
                    every indulgence, as the desire for intoxicating drink strengthens
                    with its use. The only safe course is to shun the theater, the circus,
                    and every other questionable place of amusement.
                       "There are modes of recreation which are highly beneficial to
                    both mind and body. An enlightened, discriminating mind will
                    find abundant means for entertainment and diversion, from
                    sources not only innocent, but instructive."—Testimonies, Vol.

                                                                           January   9

          Part 3    What is "a living sacrifice"?
      THE BODY
    Rom. 12:1, 2
                     "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God,
                   that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable
                   unto God, which is your reasonable service. And be not con-
                   formed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing
                   of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and accept-
                   able, and perfect, will of God."
                      In a world where pleasure isa prime motivation, Christians must
                   continually guard and control their appetites. Alcohol, tobacco,
                   drugs, and sexual immorality are appetite traps to avoid. The Chris-
                   tian must reject all appetite satisfaction that causes the body and
                   mind to function at less than optimum efficiency.
                      "All should have an intelligent knowledge of the human frame,
                   that they may keep their bodies in the condition necessary to
                   do the work of the Lord. Those who form habits that weaken
                   the nerve power and lessen the vigor of mind or body, make them-
                   selves inefficient for the work God has given them to do. On the
                   other hand, a pure, healthy life is most favorable for the perfection
                   of Christian character and for the development of the powers
                   of mind and body."—Counsels on Health, page 41.
                     What reasons does Paul give for glorifying God in the human
                   body? 1 Cor. 6:19, 20.

                     Note that this counsel is in the context of sexual immorality,
                   which is a misuse of the most intimate of communication. Such
                   conduct not only defies the Ten Commandments but also defiles
                   the temple of the Holy Spirit and hinders His work in the life.
                     What two possible sources does Paul point out as the control
                   of the body for sin or righteousness? Rom. 6:12, 13.

                     "In thus dedicating his members unto God, the Christian com-
                   mits himself to strive, by the empowering of God's Spirit, for the
                   greatest possible perfection of every organ of the body and quality
                   of the mind, that he may know, love, and serve his Redeemer
                   acceptably."—SDA Bible Commentary, on Rom. 6:13.
THINK IT THROUGH     How completely have I yielded my body and its senses to
                   the control of righteousness?

                     "Never should we lower the standard of righteousness in order
                   to accommodate inherited or cultivated tendencies to wrong-
                   doing. We need to understand that imperfection of character is
                   sin. All righteous attributes of character dwell in God as a per-
                   fect, harmonious whole, and every one who receives Christ as
                   a personal Saviour is privileged to possess these attributes."—

                   shall speak unto thee; and we will hear it, and do it. And the
                   Lord heard the voice of your words, when ye spake unto me;
                   and the Lord said unto me, I have heard the voice of the words
                   of this people, which they have spoken unto thee: they have
                   well said all that they have spoken. 0 that there were such
                   an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my
                   commandments always, that it might be well with them, and
                   with their children for ever!"
                     They sensed the earth shaking, they saw the lightning flash,
                   they heard the thunder rumble. They even had a privilege long
                   denied men—the children of Israel heard God speak the Ten Com-
                   mandments.
                     This experience completely overawed them. They could imagine
                   no circumstance in which they would forget such power. They
                   were terrified then. God commended them for their response.
                   But He saw deeper. He knew that the emotional experience of
                   that day at Sinai had not changed their hearts.
                     What was the result of Christ's testimony to the disciples on
                   the road to Emmaus? Luke 24:32.

                     Note that in the experience of the disciples there was a blending
                   of emotion with the intellectual act of learning the truth.
                     "After His resurrection Jesus appeared to His disciples on the
                   way to Emmaus, and, 'beginning at Moses and all the prophets,
                   He expounded unto them in all the Scriptures the things concern-
                   ing Himself.' Luke 24:27. The hearts of the disciples were stirred.
                   Faith was kindled. They were 'begotten again into a lively hope'
                   even before Jesus revealed Himself to them."—The Great

                     "Their [the Israelites'] profound awe at the manifestation of
                   divine power and glory was the very attitude of mind and heart
                   God desired to produce in them. It is only when a man becomes
                   humble in God's sight, when he realizes his utter sinfulness and
                   helplessness in contrast to God's righteousness and omnipotence,

                    his commandme" which I command thee this day, that it may
                    go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that
                    thou mayest prolong thy days upon the earth, which the Lord
                    thy God giveth thee, for ever."
                      In Deuteronomy 4 Moses recounts the impressive wonders the
                   people had witnessed. He talks of Baal-peor (verse 3); of the fire
                   at Horeb (verses 10-12); of the voice of God (verses 12, 13); of
                   what they did not see at Horeb (verses 15-19); of the voice, the
                   fire, and many other wonders (verses 33, 34, 37).
                      All this God did in love (verse 37). Now He asks the people
                   to apply their reason to these experiences and come up with a
                   logical conclusion—to serve and obey God.
                       "In reviewing our past history, having traveled over every step
                   of advance to our present standing, I can say, Praise God! As
                   I see what the Lord has wrought, I am filled with astonishment,
                    and with confidence in Christ as leader. We have nothing to fear
                    for the future, except as we shall forget the way the Lord has
                    led us, and His teaching in our past history."—Life Sketches, page
                   196.
                      How should we classify the experience of forgiveness and
                    cleansing from sin—emotional or rational? Isa. 1:18-20.

                      The ability to draw conclusions from data is the mark of reason.
                    The highest use of reason, the greatest display of logic, is the
                    acceptance of the plan of-salvation revealed in Jesus Christ.

                       Every facet of man's life may be sanctified. Under no circum-
                    stances should we consider salvation as something that applies
                    to our spiritual natures and neglects our bodies, or applies to
                    our bodies but omits our minds. The whole man—physical, intel-
                    lectual, emotional, moral, and social—can come under the control
                    of God.
                       "The truth must sanctify the whole man—his mind, his thoughts,
                    his heart, his strength. His vital powers will not be consumed
                    upon his own lustful practices. These must be overcome, or they
                    will overcome him....
                       "Sanctification—how many understand its full meaning? The
                    mind is befogged by sensual malaria. The thoughts need purifying.
                    What might not men and women have been had they realized
                    that the treatment of the body has everything to do with the vigor
                    and purity of mind and heart.
                       "The true Christian obtains an experience which brings holiness.
                    He is without a spot of guilt upon the conscience, or a taint of
                    corruption upon the soul. The spirituality of the law of God, with
                    its limiting principles, is brought into his life. The light of truth
                    irradiates his understanding. A glow of perfect love for the
                    Redeemer clears away the miasma which has interposed between
                    his soul and God. The will of God has become his will, pure,
                    elevated, refined, and sanctified. His countenance reveals the light
                    of heaven. His body is a fit temple for the Holy Spirit. Holiness
                    adorns his character. God can commune with him; for soul and

                    is merged in His will, the mind becomes one with His mind, the

                       We may well wonder why God went to such pains to redeem
                     us. What is there in us that is to be desired? Why did He not

                     desire to restore the original communication between Himself and

                       To receive the message of this love; to know that God is seeking

                     that did not love Him! Who can know the depths of that love

                       God has chosen to let us know about Himself. More than this,
                     our knowledge of Him is with a purpose in mind. It can lead to

                    What indicates man's estrangement from God after the fall?
                   Gen. 3:9, 10.
                      God communicated to Adam directly the results that would come
                   if he disobeyed God's instruction. Once Adam yielded to tempta-
                   tion he was lost; he tried to place himself out of contact with
                   divinity.
                      God's concerned inquiry, "Where art thou?" marks the begin-
                   ning of the long approach to man that led at last to Calvary. Out
                   of this concern for a loved and lost creation came the Bible and
                   the messages of the prophets. Because of this decision to seek
                   mankind, we know what is wrong with the world, we know the
                   way out.

     GOD CHOOSES by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of recon-
               HIS ciliation; to wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world
     MESSENGERS unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath
     2 Cor. 5:18-20 committed unto us the word of reconciliation. Now then we are
                     ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by
                     us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God."
                      The messages God gives differ in scope. Some are timeless.
                    These make up the Scriptures. To them, men of all eras may refer
                    for objective standards and divine guidance.
                      The divine origin of any messages will be recognized by their
                    agreement with the Scripture testimony. God illuminates the Scrip-
                    tures for every believer, and that believer thus has a relationship
                    to God that is unique. A saved sinner is the gospel story in minia-
                    ture.
                      It is from our personal communication of the gospel message
                    to another individual that the real effectiveness of our ambassador-
                    ship derives. Upon those who have received the message of saving
                    love devolves the responsibility of communicating the word of
                    reconciliation to others.
                     By what unique experience were the Scriptures given to the
                    world? 2 Peter 1:19-21.


                      Which of the gifts that God gives to His church are gifts of
                    communication? 1 Cor. 12:7-11.

                      Responsibilities vary in degree and purpose according to God's
                    choosing, opportunity, and the talent of the individual. No faithful

                       "Every chapter and every verse of the Bible is a communication
                    from God to men. We should bind its precepts as signs upon
                    our hands and as frontlets between our eyes. If studied and obeyed,
                    it would lead God's people, as the Israelites were led, by the pillar
                    of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night." —Patriarchs and
                    Prophets, page 504.
                       "All men do not receive the same gifts, but to every servant
                    of the Master some gift of the Spirit is promised... .
                       "The gifts are already ours in Christ, but their actual possession
                    depends upon our reception of the Spirit of God."—Christ's Object

The Divine Media       LESSON 3                                     ❑ Wednesday
                                                                      January 17
           Part 4     "The Lord came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto them;
      WHEN GOD he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten
         WROTE thousands of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law for
    Lieut. 33:2, 3 them. Yea, he loved the people; all his saints are in thy hand:
                    and they sat down at thy feet; every one shall receive of thy
                    words."

                      The law mentioned here is the Ten Commandments. God calls
                   these commandments a "testimony." Ex. 31:18. From this
                   designation the following expressions derive: the "tables of
                   testimony," the "ark of the testimony," the "veil of the testi-
                   mony," and even the "tabernacle of the testimony." A testimony
                   is a witness. The witness of the prophets is one way God speaks
                   to mankind. But in the Ten Commandments we have the prime
                   witness, a declaration of God's character, nature, and authority.
                   They witness also to man's depravity.
                      Today philosophers and some ministers advise the Christian
                   to look inward to discover God. All man's experiences of the divine
                   are said to come from within. But by writing the Ten Command-
                   ments, God showed that certain objective standards must be
                   accepted. These will be the standard of the final judgment.
                    What warning for all is inherent in the words written on the
                   walls of Belshazzar's palace? Dan. 5:24-28.


                     What method did Christ use to show His forgiveness and love
                   for the sinner? John 8:3-11.


                     God's written Ten must be satisfied either in judgment or in
                   forgiveness.
THINK IT THROUGH     Are the Ten Commandments written for me on tables of stone
                   only, or have they been written on my heart?




                      "The subject of man's personal responsibility is understood by
                   but few; and yet it is a matter of the greatest importance. We
                   may each obey and live, or we may transgress God's law, defy
                   His authority, and receive the punishment that is meet. Then to
                   every soul the question comes home with force, Shall I obey the
                   voice from heaven, the ten words spoken from Sinai, or shall
                   I go with the multitude who trample on that fiery law? To those
                   who love God it will be the highest delight to keep His command-
                   ments, and to do those things that are pleasing in His sight. But
                   the natural heart hates the law of God, and wars against its holy
                   claims. Men shut their souls from the divine light, refusing to
                   walk in it as it shines upon them. They sacrifice purity of heart,
                   the favor of God, and their hope of heaven, for selfish gratification
                   or worldly gain."—Selected Messages, Bk. 1, pp. 216, 217.

The Divine Media         LESSON 3                                         ❑ Thursday
                                                                           January 18
             Part 5     "And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures,
         WHEN MEN which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith
        WROTE FOR which is in Christ Jesus. All scripture is given by inspiration
               GOD of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction,
     2 Tim. 3:15, 16 for instruction in righteousness."

                       What does the term "inspiration" mean? How do we determine
                     what is inspired and what is not? Is it a matter of personal judg-
                     ment? Would Paul have expected Timothy to look within himself
                     to discover whether what he read was inspired for him?
                        Maintaining confidence in the Word of God as a direct communi-
                     cation from Divinity to and through man is not easy in the face
                     of many assaults on inspiration. We do not look on the prophets
                     as stenographers receiving dictation, but we do believe that God
                     inspired their thoughts to record what we needed to know.
                       How did God instruct Moses to record His covenant with Israel?
                     Ex. 34:27.


                       There are several records of a reformation resulting from the
                     reading of the book of the law. For the Israelites this written record
                     became a sanctifying and redeeming communication from God.
                     See 2 Kings 22; Nehemiah 8.
                       What did Jeremiah say was the Lord's command to him? Jer.
                     36:1, 2.

THINK IT THROUGH       Consider for a few moments the power and scope of the
                     Bible—its influence on history, on lives, on you personally.
                     What is the secret of its power?




                        "As the mine has rich veins of gold and silver hidden beneath
                     the surface, so that all must dig who would discover its precious
                     stores, so the Holy Scriptures have treasures of truth that are
                     revealed only to the earnest, humble, prayerful seeker. God
                     designed the Bible to be a lessonbook to all mankind, in childhood,
                     youth, and manhood, and to be studied through all time. He gave
                     His word to men as a revelation of Himself. Every new truth dis-
                     cerned is a fresh disclosure of the character of its Author. The
                     study of the Scriptures is the means divinely ordained to bring
                     men into closer connection with their Creator and to give them
                     a clearer knowledge of His will. It is the medium of communication
                     between God and man."—The Great Controversy, page 69.
                       "An earnest, reverent study of the Scriptures, bringing the mind
                     of the student in direct contact with the infinite mind, would give
                     to the world men of stronger and more active intellect, as well
                     as of nobler principle, than has ever resulted from the ablest train-
                     ing that human philosophy affords."—The Great Controversy,

     WHEN THE      and the Word was God."
    WORD CAME        "That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh
      John 1:1,    into the world."
      9, 12, 14      "But as many as received him, to them gave he power to
                   become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name."
                     "And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, ... full
                   of grace and truth."
                      Miracles, prophets, angels, natural events—all had been used
                   to penetrate the consciousness of mankind. Now the final Word
                   about God is given. Now there will be no doubt about the nature
                   of the Deity. Christ will live, and say, and be all that should be
                   communicated about God to man.
                      Christ is the Word because He expresses God's message. Heb.
                   1:1, 2. In His words we hear the call back to our true destiny.
                   In Christ we know God. John 14:7-9.

                    What was John's witness concerning the communication of
                   God received through the living Word? 1 John 1:1-5.

                     This communication is passed on to others. Do we, like John,
                   understand God's Word sufficiently well to pass Him on? We are
                   in the same stream of communication that spoke to the apostles.
                     How does the Godhead continue to communicate to us? John
                   15:26.

                   diligent study of the Word of God?

                   pages 13, 14.
                      "As a witness for Christ, John entered into no controversy, no
                   wearisome contention. He declared what he knew, what he had
                   seen and heard. He had been intimately associated with Christ,
                   had listened to His teachings, had witnessed His mighty miracles.

    MEN CALLED thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.
       BY GOD Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send,
     Isa. 6:7, 8 and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me."
                      God has always found someone to witness for Him. Not always
                   easily though. Noah was just about alone in his faithful witness.
                   Jeremiah could not find a just man in Jerusalem. Jer. 5:1-5.
                      What kind of person does God look for? What condition was
                   Isaiah in when he received the divine call? Do you think the purify-
                   ing process put Isaiah outside the chance of sinning?
                      An essential element in the prophets is their humility. You may
                   find it all the way from Moses to John. Ellen G. White continually
                   felt her unworthiness for her responsibility.
                      There almost seems to be a credibility gap in the minds of the
                   prophets. Why should anyone believe me? But God cleansed their
                   impurity, gave them courage, shored up their faith, and sent them
                   out to do His bidding.
                     What expression did Jeremiah use to designate the way he
                   received God's messages? Jer. 1:4, 7, 13.
                     Prophets received and presented their messages in a variety
                   of ways. Some wrote out the content of a vision. Others had no
                   vision but, guided by the Spirit, wrote God's message. Some
                   prophets wrote prose, others wrote poetry. Some preached ser-
                   mons or presented acted parables and recorded them.
                    How were the messages of the prophets given permanency?
                   Hab. 2:2; 1 John 1:4; Rev. 1:11.

                     Why have certain writings been preserved and others lost? What
                   was different about the sayings of Nathan and Samuel that little
                   is recorded of them? Does the limiting of relevance to a certain
                   era bring doubt on the prophetic gift?
THINK IT THROUGH     How am I relating to the prophetic gift as manifest in the last-
                   day church?
                      "We must cherish and cultivate the faith of which prophets
                   and apostles have testified—the faith that lays hold on the prom-

                   tures' of the OT look forward to His Messianic work."—SDA Bible
                   Commentary, on Luke 24:27.
                     Why should we expect a Book from God to have a unifying
                   concept? How does this set the Bible apart from other religious
                   books? Is the concept of Christ vital to the inspiration of the
                   Bible?
                     The Bible became completely possible only through Jesus
                   Christ. Without the concept of the Messiah the writers of the Bible
                   would have lacked direction and purpose. It would have been
                   a story without an end, a hope without possibility of fulfillment,
                   a dream with a nightmare ending. But with Christ the channels
                   are open, directed toward the goal of redeeming humanity in Him.

                      For whom did Jesus tell the Jews to look in Scripture? John
                    5:39, 46, 47.

                      Does the attitude of the reader affect the validity of the mes-
                    sage in the Scripture? What does ancient Israel's attitude toward
                    the gospel teach us about assenting to the Word? Rom. 10:18,
                    19, 21.

                     "But those who bring to the investigation of the word a spirit
                    which it does not approve, will take away from the search a spirit
                    which it has not imparted."—Review and Herald, Dec. 15, 1896.

THINK IT THROUGH      Many books have central characters. In what way is the cen-
                    trality of Christ different in the Bible?


                       "Through all the ages the great truth of justification by faith
                    has stood as a mighty beacon to guide repentant sinners into
                    the way of life."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 373.
                       "The blessed Bible gives us a knowledge of the great plan of
                    salvation, and shows us how every individual may have eternal
                    life. Who is the author of the book?—Jesus Christ. He is the True
                    Witness, and He says to His own, 'I give unto them eternal life;
                    and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them
                    out of My hand.' The Bible is to show us the way to Christ, and
                    in Christ eternal life is revealed."—Fundamentals of Christian
                    Education, page 308.
                       "After the transgression of Adam, the Lord spoke no longer
                    directly with man; the human race was given into the hands of
                    Christ, and all communication came through Him to the world."—

          Part 3   "And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some,
     MEN RECEIVE evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; for the perfecting
     GOD'S GIFTS of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of
     Eph. 4:11-13 the body of Christ: till we all come in the unity of the faith,
                 and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man,
                 unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ."
                     "Apostles .... Paul is not so much saying that certain gifts
                   were given to men in order that they might become apostles,
                   as that they who had received the gift were themselves being
                   given to the church. The church was receiving to its ministry men
                   who were properly equipped for their functions. Compare Rom.
                   12:6-8.
                     "Prophets .... Prophets were expounders and explainers of
                   the will of God that had been made known to them by supernatural
                   means .... The prophetic gift was indispensable to the founding
                   of the church in NT times, and is the appointed guide of the
                   remnant church (Rev. 19:10).
                      "Evangelists .... The euaggelistai [evangelists] were appar-
                   ently not attached to any particular locality, but bore their tes-
                   timony from place to place. They probably did not exercise the
                   full authority of apostles (Acts 21:8; 2 Tim. 4:5). The ministry of
                   the evangelists appears to have been directed chiefly to the
                   heathen, whereas the pastors and teachers served the local con-
                   gregations... .
                      "Pastors and teachers. The structure of this phrase, in the
                   Greek, suggests that Paul intends to speak of two phases of one
                   office. Any effective ministry is a teaching ministry."—SDA Bible
                   Commentary, on Eph. 4:11.
                     What was Paul's estimate of the presence of gifts in the Corinth
                   church? 1 Cor. 1:6, 7. What gifts can you find 'in the church
                   today?

                     To what gift did Peter ascribe the events of the Day of Pente-
                   cost? Acts 2:17, 18.

                     "If this prophecy of Joel met a partial fulfillment in the days
                   of the apostles, we are living in a time when it is to be even
                   more evidently manifest to the people of God."—Ellen G. White
                   Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 4, p. 1175.

THINK IT THROUGH     How did the reaction of the children of Israel to the prophetic
                   gift ultimately affect their spiritual destiny?

                      "Look at the flowers in a carpet, and notice the different colored
                   threads. All are not pink, all are not green, all are not blue. A
                   variety of colors are woven together to perfect the pattern. So
                   it is in the design of God. He has a purpose in placing us where
                   we must learn to live as individuals. We are not all fitted to do
                   the same kind of work, but each man's work is designed by God
                   to help make up His plan."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible

             Part 4   "And the Lord God of their fathers sent to them by his messen-
         MEN GIVE gers, rising up betimes, and sending; because he had compas-
            GOD'S sion on his people, and on his dwelling place."
          MESSAGE
     2 Chron. 36:15   Do we detect in these words a slight air of disappointment or
                    even chagrin at what might have been? Perhaps we might even
                    say, "We would not have done as they"; yet the same era that
                    looked back at this point in history was neglecting the messengers
                    of God. Is our condition any better?
                      God's communications reveal the timelessness of man's need
                    and God's love. These two stand in dynamic relation to each other
                    in the framework of Scripture. This is the basic reason for the
                    relevance of the Bible. "The Bible and the soul were made one
                    for the other."—Ellen G. White, Signs of the Times, Aug. 20, 1894.
                    Here is a mirror for you and me. Yet more than a mirror. It reaches
                    out to transform the image we see. The Bible is more, says more,
                    than mere man could make it be or say.
                      Consider the answer of the Bible to your personal crises. What
                    has it said to you when you needed help?

                      What was the source of faith to which the Hebrew believers
                     were pointed? Heb. 12:2, 3.

                       What dangers in misconstruing the book of Revelation are
                     applicable to all Scripture? Rev. 22:18, 19.

                        "Those who, by their human construction, shall make the Scrip-
                     ture to utter that which Christ has never placed upon it, weaken
                     its force, making the voice of God in instruction and warnings
                     to testify falsehood, to avoid the inconvenience incurred by obedi-
                     ence to God's requirements, have become signboards, pointing
                     in the wrong direction, into false paths, which lead to transgression
                     and death."—Fundamentals of Christian Education, page 387.

THINK IT THROUGH       Is the Spirit convicting me about the same problem over and
                     over again? Is God's constancy an excuse for my compromise?


                        "There is necessity for every family to make the Bible the book
                     of their study. Christ's sayings are pure gold, without one particle
                     of dross, unless men, with their human understanding, shall try
                     to put it there, and make falsehood appear as a portion of truth.
                     To those who have received the false interpretation of the word,
                     when they search the Scriptures with the determined effort to
                     obtain the very marrow of truth contained in them, the Holy Spirit
                     opens the eyes of their understanding, and the truths of the word
                     are to them as a new revelation. Their hearts are quickened to
                     a new and living faith, and they behold wondrous things out of
                     His law. The teachings of Christ have a breadth and depth to
                     many which they have never understood before."—Fundamentals

                                                                        January 25
          Part 5    What is implied in this text as to the origin of the testimony
          MEN'S of Jesus?
        THREATS
       TO GOD'S
          GIFTS     "And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me,
      Rev. 19:10 See thou do it not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren
                  that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony
                  of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy."
                     Unless we follow the instruction already received, we cannot
                   expect that new revelations will come from the Spirit.
                     What is the situation of the remnant when they are pointed
                   out as possessing the prophetic gift? Rev. 12:12, 17.

                      Speaking of the messages the Lord had given her, Ellen G.
                   White said, "Time and trial have not made void the instruction
                   given, but through years of suffering and self-sacrifice have estab-
                   lished the truth of the testimony given. The instruction that was
                   given in the early days of the message is to be held as safe instruc-
                   tion to follow in these its closing days."—Selected Messages, Bk.
                   1, p. 41.
                      Every preacher, every teacher, every church member is to a
                   degree a bearer of truth and light. "There are those who will
                   misinterpret the messages that God has given, in accordance with
                   their spiritual blindness."—Selected Messages, Bk. 1, p. 41.
                      How important then that we understand what the Bible and
                   the spirit of prophecy are saying to God's people.
                     What warning did Christ have for those who live in the last
                   days? Matt. 24:24.

                     "Every variety of error will be brought out in the mysterious
                   working of Satan, which would, if it were possible, deceive the
                   very elect, and turn them from the truth."—Selected Messages,
                   Bk. 2, p. 98.
THINK IT THROUGH     What different ways are there of negating the witness of
                   prophecy? Of making it more effective?

                     "When the Lord has a genuine channel of light, there are always
                   plenty of counterfeits. Satan will surely enter any door thrown
                   open for him. He will give messages of truth, mingling with the
                   truth ideas of his own, prepared to mislead souls, to draw the
                   mind to human beings and their sayings, and prevent it from hold-
                   ing firmly to a 'Thus saith the Lord.' In God's dealings with His
                   people, all is quiet; with those who trust in Him, all is calm and
                   unpretending. There will be simple, true, earnest believers in the
                   Bible, and there will be doers of the Word as well as hearers.
                   There will be sound, earnest, sensible waiting upon God. The
                   believer will hang his helpless soul on Jesus Christ."—Selected

                                                                          January 26
          Part 6     Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether
     MEN'S GIFTS they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out
         TESTED into the world. Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit
     1 John 4:1-3 that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:
                   and every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come
                   in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist,
                   whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now
                   already is it in the world."

                     Apparently in John's day there was a crisis in the church on
                   the question of the humanity of Jesus Christ. According to this
                   passage the basic identification of a prophet is not in his claim
                   to be a prophet, but in the truth of his teachings. God is not
                   inconsistent nor contradictory. The truthfulness of a prophet's
                   claims can be tested by the Bible.
                     Anything that diminishes the authority or efficacy of Christ's
                   ministry is antichrist. It is a denial that Christ is what God sent
                   Him to be. Our danger today is not that we shall be led astray
                   by a Simon or cursed by a latter-day Balaam. But we do live in
                   mortal peril from the worldliness and materialism of society.
                   Through advertising, social pressure, and education the aggres-
                   sive evangelists of doubt are assailing the strongholds of faith.
                     Why did God decree the expulsion of the Canaanites from
                   the Promised Land? Deut. 18:9-12.
                      These false voices are still speaking. Many forms of spiritualism
                   and astrology confront modern man. A decision to live by the
                   Word of God is the only safeguard against these false communica-
                   tions. Isa. 8:20.


                     What dangers threaten faith in the time of the end? 1 Tim.
                   4:1, 2; 2 Tim. 4:3, 4.

THINK IT THROUGH     What can arm faith against the assaults of doubt and satanic
                   delusions?


                      "In these days of peril we are not to accept everything that
                    men bring to us as truth. As professed teachers from God come
                    to us declaring that they have a message from God, it is proper
                    to inquire carefully, How do we know that this is truth? Jesus
                    has told us that 'false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many'
                    (Matt. 24:11). But we need not be deceived; for the Word of God
                    gives us a test whereby we may know what is truth. The prophet
                    says, 'To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according
                    to this word, it is because there is no light in them' (Isa. 8:20).
                      "From this statement it is evident that it becomes us to be dili-
                    gent Bible students, that we may know what is according to the
                    law and the testimony. We are safe in no other course of action."

                                                                            January 28
            Part 1     What is the meaning of Jesus' affirmation that life is contained
     GOOD TIDINGS    in words?
        John 7:46;
          6:63, 68
                        "The officers answered, Never man spake like this man."
                        "It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing:
                     the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are
                     life."
                        "Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we
                     go? thou hest the words of eternal life."

                       Christ, with His heavenly Father, originated the plan of salvation,
                     and this was the source of His authority. He knew that the
                     message He was bringing would do for man exactly what He
                     promised. His words contained and conveyed life.
                       What sources of authority undergirded the witness of Jesus?
                     John 5:32-36, 39.


                        Too often modern man questions the authority of God's words
                     —his own surmisings seem more satisfying. Our danger is that
                     we might likewise doubt.
                        "While His teaching was simple, He spoke as one having author-
                     ity. This characteristic set His teaching in contrast with that of
                     all others. The rabbis spoke with doubt and hesitancy, as if the
                     Scriptures might be interpreted to mean one thing or exactly the
                     opposite.... But Jesus taught the Scriptures as of unquestionable
                     authority. Whatever His subject, it was presented with power, as
                     if His words could not be controverted."—The Desire of Ages,
                     page 253.
                        As we convey the teachings of Christ, we are bearing the mes-
                     sage of God. See John 17:8.
                        At the birth of Jesus the angel told the watching, wonder-struck
                     shepherds that he brought tidings of great joy. We may likewise
                     be bearers of good news, simply by relating the messages of Christ.
THINK IT THROUGH      Read the story of Nicodemus in John 3. How can I make the
                     Word more fresh and meaningful in my experience?




                        "Yet He was earnest, rather than vehement. He spoke as one
                     who had a definite purpose to fulfill. He was bringing to view
                     the realities of the eternal world. In every theme God was revealed.
                     Jesus sought to break the spell of infatuation which keeps men
                     absorbed in earthly things. He placed the things of this life in
                     their true relation, as subordinate to thoge of eternal interest;
                     but He did not ignore their importance. He taught that heaven
                     and earth are linked together, and that a knowledge of divine
                     truth prepares men better to perform the duties of everyday life."

God's Good Word         LESSON 5                                          ❑ Monday
                                                                          January 29
            Part 2     Why did Jesus use parables in His teaching?
    CLEAR TRUTH
   Matt. 13:34, 35
                       "All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables;
                     and without a parable spake he not unto them: that it might
                     be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open
                     my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept
                     secret from the foundation of the world."

                        Christ used parables to capture and hold attention. By this
                     means He was able to arouse conviction in the hearts of the
                     hearers. "Who hath ears, let him hear." The parables were made
                     effective when the hearers discovered truth for themselves in these
                     illustrations from everyday life. Christ also used parables to
                     conceal the truth from some persons.
                        "Jesus spoke before the Pharisees and Sadducees in parables,
                     hiding the clearness of truth under symbols and figures because
                     they would make a wrong use of the truths He presented before
                     them; but to His disciples He spoke plainly. We should learn from
                     Christ's method of teaching and be careful not to cut off the
                     ears of the people by presenting truths which, not being fully
                     explained, they are in no way prepared to receive."—Testimonies,
                     Vol. 3, p. 426.

                       Why is the gospel received in different ways by different
                     people? Matt. 13:13-16.


                       "From Christ's methods of labor we may learn many valuable
                     lessons. He did not follow merely one method; in various ways
                     He sought to gain the attention of the multitude; and then He
                     proclaimed to them the truths of the gospel."—Evangelism, page
                     123.
THINK IT THROUGH      Am I seeking for ways of making the gospel mean more to
                     myself, my family, my friends?



                        "His messages of mercy were varied to suit His audience. He
                     knew 'how to speak a word in season to him that is weary' (Isa.
                     50:4); for grace was poured upon His lips, that He might convey
                     to men in the most attractive way the treasures of truth. He had
                     tact to meet the prejudiced minds, and surprise them with illustra-
                     tions that won their attention. . . . His illustrations were taken
                     from the things of daily life, and although they were simple, they
                     had in them a wonderful depth of meaning. The birds of the air,
                     the lilies of the field, the seed, the shepherd and the sheep,—
                     with these objects Christ illustrated immortal truth; and ever after-
                     ward, when His hearers chanced to see these things of nature,
                     they recalled His words."—The Desire of Ages, page 254.
                        "As He passed through the towns and cities He was like a vital
                     current, diffusing life and joy."—The Ministry of Healing, pages

            Part 3   "And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her,
       MOTIVATED and said unto her, Weep not. And he came and touched the
                BY bier: and they that bare him stood still. And he said, Young
     COMPASSION man, I say unto thee, Arise."
     Luke 7:13, 14
                     "He taught the people with patient love. His deep, searching
                   wisdom knew the wants of every soul among His listeners; and
                   when He saw them refuse the message of peace and love that
                   He came to give them, His heart felt anguish to the very depths."—
                   Gospel Workers; page 49.

                      How did Jesus react on two occasions to people who desired
                    His ministrations? Matt. 19:13, 14; Mark 10:46-52.

                      Note the reassuring words of Jesus. Often all that people need
                    to give them courage is a word. Christ had empathy with man's
                    needs. Often He spoke reassuring words, such as "thy sins be
                    forgiven thee" or "thy faith hath made thee whole." How cherished
                    are the words that lead men out of the pit of despair and doubt!

                     What combination of attitudes do you recognize in Jesus'
                    words in Matt. 23:37-39?


                      How important is the motivation for words! Jesus spoke some
                   words that appear severe in writing, but they were not said harshly.
                   "Christ Himself did not suppress one word of truth, but He spoke
                   it always in love. He exercised the greatest tact, and thoughtful,
                   kind attention in His intercourse with the people. He was never
                   rude, never needlessly spoke a severe word, never gave needless
                   pain to a sensitive soul. He did not censure human weakness.
                   He fearlessly denounced hypocrisy, unbelief, and iniquity, but tears
                   were in His voice as He uttered His scathing rebukes."—The
                   Desire of Ages; page 353.

THINK IT THROUGH      What motivates me in my dealings with men? Is compassion
                    a major consideration?


                     "To love as Christ loved means to manifest unselfishness at
                   all times and in all places, by kind words and pleasant looks.
                   These cost those who give them nothing, but they leave behind
                   a fragrance that surrounds the soul. Their effect can never be
                   estimated. Not only are they a blessing to the receiver, but to
                   the giver; for they react upon him. Genuine love is a precious
                   attribute of heavenly origin, which increases in fragrance in pro-
                   portion as it is dispensed to others."—Ellen G. White Comments,

                     "The afflicted, suffering ones who sought Christ as their helper,
                   were charmed with the divine perfection, the beauty of holiness,
                   that shone forth in His character."—Ellen G. White Comments,

                                                                        January 31
          Part 4    "And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not. Which
      SINCERITY of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do
    John 8:45, 46 ye not believe me?"
                     "Jesus appeals to the knowledge of the Jews concerning His
                   sinless life. He Himself had given testimony of His entire con-
                   formity to the Father's will (ch. 8:29). Despite all the spying of
                   the religious leaders, not one stain of sin had been detected.
                   Their silence upon this occasion confirmed His testimony."—SDA
                   Bible Commentary, on John 8:46.
                     Christ practiced what He preached. This is the very basis of
                   sincerity. He had no need to gloss over His failings, for He was
                   sinless. This was the root of His believability.
                     Why did the Samaritans believe Jesus? John 4:41, 42.


                     "The readiness of these Samaritans to believe the evidence that
                   Jesus was the "Prophet" of whom Moses spoke (see on v. 26)
                   stands forth in sharp contrast to the uncertainty with which the
                   Jews received Him (see on ch. 1:10, 11). His life and message
                   constituted convincing evidence to the Samaritans that Moses'
                   prediction had met its fulfillment in the person of Jesus of
                   Nazareth."—SDA Bible Commentary, on John 4:42.
                     In the polyglot world of Christ's day He rang true to the peoples
                   of all types and races. Nothing that might be called "phony" ever
                   tainted His ministry.

                     From Paul's statement in Phil. 4:9, what would you infer about
                   the consistency between Paul's words and his behavior?


THINK IT THROUGH    Is there harmony between my inward sentiments, and my
                   words and behavior?




                      "Encourage in your children a truthful, honest disposition. Let
                   them never have occasion to doubt your sincerity and exact
                   truthfulness."—Spiritual Gifts, Vol. 2, p. 256.
                       "The religion of Christ is sincerity itself. Zeal for God's glory
                   is the motive implanted by the Holy Spirit; and only the effectual
                   working of the Spirit can implant this motive. Only the power
                   of God can banish self-seeking and hypocrisy."—The Desire of
                   Ages; page 409.
                       "The test of sincerity is not in words, but in deeds. Christ does
                   not say to any man, What say ye more than others? but, 'What
                   do ye more than others?' Matt. 5:47. Full of meaning are His words,
                   'If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.' John 13:17.
                   Words are of no value unless they are accompanied with approp-

                      The disciples regarded Christ as a message from God. As they
                    read Him, they discovered much about God. They found Him to
                    be Life, for He is the Word of Life. They found that they could
                    rediscover fellowship with God and maintain it with the Son. They
                    found that darkness dispersed before the presence of Christ.
                      Against this life, this light, this fellowship, they measured their
                    own spiritual development. They sought to convey their personal
                    fellowship with Christ to others, that it might transform them also.
                      How does God both enlarge and confine the sphere of His
                    saving love? John 3:16.

                       "Christ became one flesh with us, in order that we might become
                    one spirit with Him. It is by virtue of this union that we are to
                    come forth from the grave,—not merely as a manifestation of the
                    power of Christ, but because, through faith, His life has become
                    ours. Those who see Christ in His true character, and receive
                    Him into the heart, have everlasting life. It is through the Spirit
                    that Christ dwells in us; and the Spirit of God, received into the
                    heart by faith, is the beginning of the life eternal."—The Desire

THINK IT THROUGH       What kind of testimony is my life bearing? Does it show that
                    I am receiving the light?


                       "Christ came in the form of humanity to live the law of God.
                    He was the word of life. He came to be the gospel of salvation
                    to the world, and to fulfil every specification of the law. Jesus
                    is the word, the guidebook, which must be received and obeyed
                    in every particular. How necessary that this mine of truth be
                    explored, and the precious treasures of truth be discovered and

                                                                          February 2
          Part 6      The teaching of Jesus was of necessity done at a particular
     ETERNALLY     point in history. He taught in specific situations, and the truths
    MEANINGFUL     He spoke were appropriate to the circumstances in which He
                   taught. That was almost 2,000 years ago. It is reasonable to ask,
                   "Are His teachings relevant to the twentieth-century scene?" To
                   prepare a response to that question read the Sermon on the Mount,
                   Matthew 5 to 7, in a modern translation. When you have finished
                   reading it, go back and give special attention to the selections
                   from the sermon listed below. Has Jesus stated temporary counsel
                   suited to the circumstances of His day, or has He stated permanent
                   and universal principles? Ask yourself these questions, "Do the
                   principles that Jesus taught have any valid relation to modern
                   life? How do they apply to life today?"
                      "Blessed are the poor in spirit." Matthew 5:3.
                      "Blessed are the pure in heart." Verse 8.
                      "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your
                   good works." Verse 16.
                      "Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least command-
                   ments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in
                   the kingdom of heaven." Verse 19.
                      "Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath commit-
                   ted adultery with her already in his heart." Verse 28.
                      "Resist not evil." Verse 39.
                      "Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to
                    them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use
                   you." Verse 44.
                      "Give us this day our daily bread." Matt. 6:11.
                      "Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also." Verse
                   21.
                     What do you think is meant by the statement, "Jesus Christ
                   the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever"? Heb. 13:8.


THINK IT THROUGH     How can I detect a drift away from making Christ's teachings
                   central in my life?
                     Could it be possible that a major reason for the failures of
                   modern society is that we have not leavened it with the pure
                   principles of heaven lived in our lives?


                     "Oh, that our brethren and sisters might value aright the truth!
                   Oh, that they might become sanctified by it! Oh, that they might
                   realize that upon them rests the responsibility of communicating
                   this truth to others! But they do not feel the importance of living
                   the truth, of being doers of the words of Christ. Many are self-
                   sufficient. They are not filled with the missionary spirit that should
                   animate the disciples of Christ. If they knew what it means to
                   have travail of soul for others, angels of God would work through
                   them to communicate a knowledge of the truth. They would know
                   the truth, and the truth would make them free.... The elevating,
                   purifying, ennobling principles of heaven would be introduced
                   into society and would work like leaven."—Testimonies, Vol. 8,

                     We humans are aware of the inner voice. See Isa. 30:20, 21.
                   We sometimes call it conscience. A sanctified conscience leads
                   toward God. Is it possible for us'to have an unsanctified con-
                   science? Titus 1:15. The Holy Spirit uses the conscience in con-
                   junction with the Word as a direct way of developing moral values.
                     In what ways did Jesus say the Spirit would guide the apostles?
                   John 15:26,27; 14:26. Are these promises limited to the apostles?

                      "Christ is represented by the Holy Spirit; and when this Spirit
                   is appreciated, when those controlled by the Spirit communicate
                   to others the energy with which they are imbued, an invisible
                   chord is touched which electrifies the whole. Would that we could

                      "Jesus says, 'Ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost
                   is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me.' It is the
                   union of the Holy Spirit and the testimony of the living witness
                   that is to warn the world. The worker for God is the agent through
                   which the heavenly communication is given, and the Holy Spirit
                   gives divine authority to the word of truth."—Ellen G. White Com-

THINK IT THROUGH     Am I seeking the guidance of the Spirit needed for my life
                   through reading the Word and through prayer?




                     "The Spirit is given as a regenerating agency, to make effectual
                   the salvation wrought by the death of our Redeemer. The Spirit
                   is constantly seeking to draw the attention of men to the great
                   offering that was made on the cross of Calvary, to unfold to the
                   world the love of God, and to open to the convicted soul the

                      "Having brought conviction of sin, and presented before the

                      All too often we fail to gain the inspiration and blessing that
                    should be ours simply because we do not open our minds to
                    the promises of God's Word, or we fail to think on the privileges

                    meek and lowly ones who believe in Christ, are as foolishness

                       "As a people our faith and practice need to be energized by
                    the Holy Spirit. No ruling power that would compel man to obey

                    from man, whose breath is in his nostrils,' the Lord commands.
                    By turning the minds of men to lean on human wisdom, we place

                   to which our human resources are unequal. He gives the Holy
                   Spirit to help in every strait, to strengthen our hope and assurance,
                   to illuminate our minds and purify our hearts. . . . There is no
                   limit to the usefulness of the one who, putting self aside, makes
                   room for the working of the Holy Spirit upon his heart and lives
                   a life wholly consecrated to God. . . . Christ declared that the
                   divine influence of the Spirit was to be with His followers unto
                   the end."—My Life Today, page 37.

                    Contrast the "works of the flesh" with the "fruit of the Spirit."
                   Gal. 5:19-25.

                     From one point of view the fruit of the Spirit is love, and the
                   other attributes mentioned in Gal. 5:22, 23 are characteristics of
                   love. Thus, unlike the gifts, it is impossible for us to divide the
                   fruit of the Spirit. It is one in our lives, lovely in all its different
                   facets.
THINK IT THROUGH     Can I see evidences of the fruit of the Spirit in my life?

                     "The influence of the Holy Spirit is the life of Christ in the soul.
                   We do not see Christ and speak to Him, but His Holy Spirit is
                   just as near us in one place as in another. It works in and through
                   every one who receives Christ. Those who know the indwelling
                   of the Spirit reveal the fruits of the Spirit—love, joy, peace, long-
                   suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith."—Ellen G. White Com-

                   Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin

                   that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they
                   that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit."
                      With a Spirit-filled life we begin to live a righteous life. Righ-
                   teousness which was impossible before becomes reality. We set
                   out for the heavenly goal. Our thoughts, our actions, become
                   Spirit-directed.
                      The contrast here is between flesh and Spirit. What condemna-
                   tion is removed? How would you describe the law of the Spirit
                   of life? What precepts does it comprise? What is the law of sin
                   and death?

                     How essential is the Spirit to our walk with Christ? Rom. 8:9-11.

                     To be intellectually convinced is not enough. Christ must dwell
                   within through the Spirit. Only as our lives bear the fruit of the
                   Spirit do we belong to Him.

                     What is possible through the Spirit-filled life? Verses 14-17.

                     Through two-way communication between the Holy Spirit and
                   our hearts we receive assurance of our new status. Despite all
                   the difficulties of life, we know that we belong to God, that we
                   are His children.
THINK IT THROUGH     What does it mean to "mortify the deeds of the body"?


                      "When we see men firm in principle, fearless in duty, zealous
                   in the cause of God, yet humble and lowly, gentle and tender,

                   for whom Christ died, we do not need to inquire: Are they Chris-
                   tians? They give unmistakable evidence that they have been with
                   Jesus and learned of Him. When men reveal the opposite traits,
                   when they are proud, vain, frivolous, worldly-minded, avaricious,
                   unkind, censorious, we need not be told with whom they are
                   associating, who is their most intimate friend. They may not believe
                   in witchcraft; but, notwithstanding this, they are holding commun-

                                                                         February 8

         Part 5     "Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know
      ASSURED not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself
    TRAJECTORY maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be
   Rom. 8:26, 27 uttered. And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the
                  mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints
                  according to the will of God."
                      No guesswork here! We may not know what is best for us, but
                   the Spirit of God dwelling in our hearts holds constant commu-
                   nion with the Father and assures God's will for us.
                      Paul speaks of "the firstfruits of the Spirit." These are the evi-
                   dences in our lives that God is changing us and leading us on.
                   He says that "we are saved by hope." Rom. 8:24. Having been
                   launched toward eternal life, there is no reason for us to lose
                   that goal. Hope locks us in on the target, and the Spirit guides
                   us onward.
                      It is because of all that goes before in Romans 8 that Paul
                   finally proclaims, "All things work together for good to them that
                   love God." Verse 28. This assertion comes from experiencing the
                   power of God.
                    What seals our hope? Eph. 4:30. How would you relate this
                   with the seal of the living God? Rev. 7:2.

                     Surely these are two ways of saying the same thing. Note how-
                   ever that we may grieve the Spirit. Does God ever turn away from
                   the seeking sinner?
                    What weapon of the Spirit helps us preserve our faith in Jesus
                   Christ? Eph. 6:17, 18.


THINK IT THROUGH     Who is basically in control of my life? Am l'being willful, dis-
                   obedient, self-seeking?



                      "I saw that all heaven is interested in our salvation; and shall
                   we be indifferent? Shall we be careless, as though it were a small
                   matter whether we are saved or lost? Shall we slight the sacrifice
                   that has been made for us? Some have done this. They have
                   trifled with offered mercy, and the frown of God is upon them.
                   God's Spirit will not always be grieved. It will depart if grieved
                   a little longer."—Testimonies, Vol. 1, p. 124.
                      "There are many who long to help others, but they feel that
                   they have no spiritual strength or light to impart. Let them present
                   their petitions at the throne of grace. Plead for the Holy Spirit.
                   God stands back of every promise He has made.. ..
                       "We must not only pray in Christ's name, but by the inspiration
                   of the Holy Spirit. This explains what is meant when it is said
                   that the Spirit 'maketh intercession for us, with groanings which
                   cannot be uttered.' Rom. 8:26. Such prayer God delights to

                     The tranquillity of heaven will never be ours until the Spirit
                  has filled us with the power to complete God's work and invite
                  all men everywhere to come to Him.
                     A Christian filled with the Spirit becomes a communicator of
                  heaven's love. He pleads, Come. Pentecost came upon a group
                  of united, pleading Christians. Acts 2:1-4. Power awaits our need.
                  God wants to finish the work. He wants us to avail ourselves of
                  His power.
                     For what are we invited to plead? Zech. 10:1; Jer. 5:24.

                       "Today you are to have your vessel purified, that it may be
                   ready for the heavenly dew, ready for the showers of the latter
                   rain; for the latter rain will come, and the blessing of God will
                   fill every soul that is purified from every defilement. It is our work
                   today to yield our souls to Christ, that we may be fitted for the
                   time of refreshing from the presence of the Lord—fitted for the
                   baptism of the Holy Spirit."—Evangelism, page 702.
                     What did God promise Judah would be the result of the out-
                   pouring of the Spirit? Joel 2:28, 29.

THINK IT THROUGH     What am I doing to prepare myself for the latter rain? Is there
                   anything I could do in my church to help open the way for God
                   to fill us with His power?

                      "A crisis is right upon us. We must now by the Holy Spirit's
                   power proclaim the great truths for these last days. It will not

                      Note the nature of prayer revealed in this passage. First, it is
                   not to impress God—repetitions mean nothing. Second, it is not
                   to impress men. Third, God answers or "rewards" prayers. Fourth,

                   into communication with God so that we may discover in secret
                   what God's will for us is.
                      Prayer is built on the fact of the omniscience of God. Because
                   He sees and knows, He can alter circumstances to affect our
                   destiny. We in turn may trust Him sufficiently so that our futures
                   are molded by us to conform with what God sees as our best
                   good. Can prayer change God's mind? Should it change ours?
                    How would you apply the parable of Luke 18:1-5 to prayer?
                   Does the judge represent God?

                     "How different is the attitude of God toward those who seek
                   Him. The appeals of the needy and distressed are considered
                   by Him with infinite compassion."—Christ's Object Lessons, page
                   165.
                     What lesson should we draw from the parable? See also
                   1 Thess. 5:17; Rom. 12:12.

                     What does Paul state as the requirements for one who prays
                   publicly? 1 Tim. 2:8.

                    ... touched me.... And he informed me, and talked with me."

                      An angel bearing God's communication brought a dramatic
                    answer to prayer. What would you list as the requirements of
                    prayer from this story? How do angels fit into the task of conveying
                    and effecting God's will? Heb. 1:13, 14.

                      How did Christ evaluate the prayers of the Pharisee and the
                    publican? Luke 18:9-14. Was there anything basically evil about
                    the Pharisee's virtues as he claimed them? Then what was wrong
                    with the prayer? How much does a sense of unworthiness play
                    in fitting us for the inflow of divine power?


                      What characteristics marked David's great prayer of confes-
                    sion? Psalm 51.


                      When the armor of God is complete, what yet remains to be
                    done? Eph. 6:17, 18.


THINK IT THROUGH      How shall we recognize the communication that God has with
                    us as a result of prayer? What sources of communication are
                    open to Him and to us?




                      "Though Daniel had long been in the service of God, and had
                    been spoken of by heaven as 'greatly beloved,' yet he now
                    appeared before God as a sinner, urging the great need of the
                    people he loved. His prayer was eloquent in its simplicity, and
                    intensely earnest. ...
                      "Heaven was bending low to hear the earnest supplication of
                    the prophet. Even before he had finished his plea for pardon and
                    restoration, the mighty Gabriel again appeared to him, and called
                    his attention to the vision he had seen prior to the fall of Babylon
                    and the death of Belshazzar."—Prophets and Kings, pages 555,

                      "David's repentance was sincere and deep. There was no effort

                    inspired his prayer. But he saw the enormity of his transgression
                    against God; he saw the defilement of his soul; he loathed his
                    sin. It was not for pardon only that he prayed, but for purity of

                   from his hands."
                     A crisis brought together active ingredients—a crisis composed
                   of personal jeopardy and a leaderless church. Prayer provided
                   the catalyst to produce the reaction.

                    What characteristic marked the prayers of the early church?
                   Acts 12:5.


                       Note too the nature of the answer. It was specific and in line
                   with the request of the church. It brought joy to God's people
                   and strengthened their faith.
                       Among the reasons for God's very specific answer was the very
                   nature of Herod's precautions against Peter's escape. "Herod was
                   lifting his hand against Omnipotence, and he was to be utterly
                   defeated."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 146. Death faced the
                   apostle: "On the morrow he was to have been led forth to die;
                   but, lo, an angel had delivered him from prison and from death."—
                   The Acts of the Apostles, page 148.

                      What led to the deliverance of Jonah from the belly of the
                   fish? Jonah 2:1, 7, 9, 10.


                     "At last Jonah had learned that 'salvation belongeth unto the
                   Lord.' Psalm 3:8. With penitence and a recognition of the saving
                   grace of God, came deliverance. Jonah was released from the
                   perils of the mighty deep and was cast upon the dry land."—

                     "To the worker for God the record of these angel visits should
                   bring strength and courage. Today, as verily as in the days of

                      "Some . . . do not see the importance of self-knowledge and
                   self-control. They do not watch and pray, lest they enter into temp-
                   tation. If they would watch, they would become acquainted with
                   their weak points, where they are most likely to be assailed by
                   temptation. With watchfulness and prayer their weakest points
                   can be so guarded as to become their strongest points, and they

                                                                          February 15
            Part 5    "Therefore confess your sins to one another, and pray for
        EFFECTIVE one another, that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous
          PRAYER man has great power in its effects. Elijah was a man of like
     James 5:16-18, nature with ourselves and he prayed fervently that it might not
             RSV rain, and for three years and six months it did not rain on the
                    earth. Then he prayed again and the heaven gave rain, and
                    the earth brought forth its fruit."

                      To open the prayer channel we must first remove those sins
                    of ours which separate us from our fellowmen. Repentance is
                    essential to effective communication through prayer. See Ps.
                    66:18.
                      What attitude is necessary on the part of one who makes
                    a request of God in prayer? James 1:5-7.


                      Faith is another essential. If you don't believe God will answer,
                    why ask? See Heb. 11:6. "Faith is the gift of God, but the power
                    to exercise it is ours. Faith is the hand by which the soul takes
                    hold upon the divine offers of grace and mercy."—Patriarchs and
                    Prophets, page 431.
                      "This faith must express on our part supreme preference, perfect
                    reliance, entire consecration. Our will must be wholly yielded to
                    the divine will, our feelings, desires, interests, and honor identified
                    with the prosperity of Christ's kingdom and the honor of His cause,
                    we constantly receiving grace from Him, and Christ accepting
                    gratitude from us."—Testimonies, Vol. 5, p. 229.

                      What characteristic marked the prayers of Epaphras? What
                    did he do in addition to his prayers? Col. 4:12, 13.

                       "For I bear him witness that he has worked hard for you and
                    for those in Laodicea and in Hierapolis." Verse 13, RSV. We need
                    more Epaphrases today—men who will both pray and work for
                    their families, their friends, their neighbors. Our prayers need
                    specifics. Generalizations blunt the power of prayer. Pray for
                    specific needs, for individuals, for the solution to special problems.
                                •
THINK IT THROUGH      What would you add to a list of requisites for effective prayer?
                    Why is one prayer more effective than another?



                       "God is too wise and good to answer our prayers always at
                     just the time and in just the manner we desire. He will do more
                     and better for us than to accomplish all our wishes. . . . Our
                     desires and interests should be lost in His will. These experiences
                     that test faith are for our benefit. By them it is made manifest
                     whether our faith is true and sincere, resting on the word of God
                     alone, or whether depending on circumstances, it is uncertain
                     and changeable. Faith is strengthened by exercise."—The Ministry

Prayer—A Two-way Channel           LESSON 7                              ❑ Friday
                                                                        February 16
            Part 6   "Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver:
     RESULTS OF in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us; ye also helping
          PRAYER together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed upon us
   2 Cor. 1:10, 11 by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many
                   on our behalf."
                     Prayer produces a sense of identity with God's cause and its
                   progress. Through prayer we share in the deliverances of others,
                   we bear the burdens of those that suffer and mourn, we identify
                   with the triumph of good and right.
                     Gratitude accompanies true prayer, for the praying believer is
                   recognizing God as the great Source of all good and that thus
                   God is deserving of thanksgiving.
                     What experience of the disciples and others preceded Pente-
                   cost? Acts 1:14; 2:1, 2.


                      "They also met together to present their requests to the Father
                   in the name of Jesus. They knew that they had a Representative
                   in heaven, an Advocate at the throne of God. In solemn awe they
                   bowed in prayer, repeating the assurance, 'Whatsoever ye shall
                   ask the Father in My name, He will give it you. Hitherto have
                   ye asked nothing in My name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your
                   joy may be full.' John 16:23, 24. Higher and still higher they
                   extended the hand of faith, with the mighty argument, 'It is Christ
                   that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right
                   hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.' Romans 8:34.
                     "The disciples prayed with intense earnestness for a fitness
                   to meet men and in their daily intercourse to speak words that
                   would lead sinners to Christ. Putting away all differences, all desire
                   for the supremacy, they came close together in Christian
                   fellowship."—The Acts of the Apostles, pages 35-37.
                     Praying and ceasing criticism of others go together. With replac-
                   ing the distorted reactions of the carnal man comes a longing
                   to see others grow in grace. A praying church is moved toward
                   those in need. The members of a praying family long for each
                   other to experience growth in Christlikeness. This happens
                   because the Spirit convicts them of the needs of others.

                     For whom and for what purpose did Paul ask the Colossian
                   believers to pray? Col. 4:2-4.


                     Pray for the many avenues by which the gospel is preached.
                   Our prayers strengthen the work of God by encouraging those
                   responsible for its onward progress, by committing us to share
                   in the work, and by moving others toward commitment.
THINK IT THROUGH     Do I pray about the needs of the work of God and my fellowmen,
                   or only about myself?

       OF WORDS
      Prov. 18:21     The right words lead to eternal life. What power there is in
                    the use of words!
                      "Words are the ambassadors of the soul. Imagine a spring land-
                    scape without the light of the sun! So would history be without
                    the life and color given it by words. It was said of Luther that

                    and to inspire him to noble thinking and glorious living."—C.
                    E. N. Macartney (ed.) Macartney's Illustrations, pages 412, 413.
                      "Closely connected with Christ's warning in regard to the sin
                    against the Holy Spirit is a warning against idle and evil words.
                    The words are an indication of that which is in the heart. 'Out
                    of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.' But the words
                    are more than an indication of character; they have power to
                    react on the character. Men are influenced by their own words.
                    Often under a momentary impulse, prompted by Satan, they give
                    utterance to jealousy or evil surmising, expressing that which they
                    do not really believe; but the expression reacts on the thoughts.
                    They are deceived by their words, and come to believe that true

                      What may we expect from the good use of words? Prov. 16:24.

                      Divine help is needed in order that our words may always affect
                    in a constructive way the one with whom we speak.
                      What are the results of God's words? Ps. 19:7-11.


THINK IT THROUGH      If well-chosen words may affect our salvation, what of the
                    careless use of words? How do words reflect emotion?




                       "The workman for God should make earnest efforts to become
                    a representative of Christ, discarding all uncomely gestures and

      WORDS OF
      DECEPTION       "False speaking in any matter, every attempt or purpose to
       Ex. 20:16   deceive our neighbor, is here included. An intention to deceive
                   is what constitutes falsehood. By a glance of the eye, a motion
                   of the hand, an expression of the countenance, a falsehood may
                   be told as effectually as by words. All intentional overstatement,
                   every hint or insinuation calculated to convey an erroneous or
                   exaggerated impression, even the statement of facts in such a
                   manner as to mislead, is falsehood. This precept forbids every
                   effort to injure our neighbor's reputation by misrepresentation
                   or evil surmising, by slander or tale bearing. Even the intentional
                   suppression of truth, by which injury may result to others, is a
                   violation of the ninth commandment"—Patriarchs and Prophets,

                     By what means did David escape, first from Saul, and then
                   from Achish? 1 Sam. 21:1-3, 10-15.

                     Is it ever right to tell a lie? Do situations make for different
                   standards of truth? "David told the priest that he had been sent
                   by the king on a secret errand, one which required the utmost
                   expedition. Here he manifested a want of faith in God, and his
                   sin resulted in causing the death of the high priest. Had the facts
                   been plainly stated, Ahimelech would have known what course
                   to pursue to preserve his life. God requires that truthfulness shall
                   mark His people, even in the greatest peril....
                      "David fled to Achish, the king of Gath; for he felt that there
                   was more safety in the midst of the enemies of his people than
                   in the dominions of Saul. But it was reported to Achish that David
                   was the man who had slain the Philistine champion years before;
                   and now he who had sought refuge with the foes of Israel found
                   himself in great peril. But, feigning madness, he deceived his
                   enemies and thus made his escape.
                      "The first error of David was his distrust of God at Nob, and

                     Words may be used to ennoble and uplift. "Kind words are
                  never lost"—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary,
                  Vol. 6, p. 1118. Christ was known for His gracious words. "Never
                  man spake like this man." John 7:46. "'If ye abide in Me,' He
                  says, 'and My words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and
                  it shall be done unto you.' It is through the word that Christ abides
                  in His followers. This is the same vital union that is represented
                  by eating His flesh and drinking His blood. The words of Christ
                  are spirit and life. Receiving them, you receive the life of the Vine.
                  You live 'by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.'
                  Matt. 4:4. The life of Christ in you produces the same fruits as
                  in Him. Living in Christ, adhering to Christ, supported by Christ,
                  drawing nourishment from Christ, you bear fruit after the similitude
                  of Christ."—The Desire of Ages, page 677. Our tongues, our lips,
                  the stream of communication that flows from us toward others,
                  should always raise the receiver to higher moral and spiritual
                  planes.
                     When the words of Jesus are lived out in human experience,
                  they cease to be merely theory and have become human personal-
                  ity.

                     How should we relate to words not in harmony with the words
                   of Christ? 1 Tim. 6:3, 5.

                     "If religious teaching does not produce godly lives, it stands
                   self-condemned. The worth of all spiritual instruction is measured
                   by the degree of spiritual health enjoyed by its adherents."—SDA
                   Bible Commentary, on 1 Tim. 6:3.

THINK IT THROUGH    What role do the spoken words of believers play in conveying
                   words of life? How would you compare this role in value to the
                   written word?


                      "Merely to hear or to read the word is not enough. He who
                   desires to be profited by the Scriptures must meditate upon the
                   truth that has been presented to him. By earnest attention and
                   prayerful thought he must learn the meaning of the words of truth,
                   and drink deep of the spirit of the holy oracles."—Christ's Object
                   Lessons, pages 59, 60.
                     "The apostle realized that the gospel had a claim upon whoever
                   might listen to his words; that one day they would stand either
                   among the pure and holy around the great white throne, or with
                   those to whom Christ would say, 'Depart from Me, ye that work
                   iniquity.' Matthew 7:23. He knew that he must meet every one
                   of his hearers before the tribunal of heaven and must there render
                   an account, not only for all that he had said and done, but for
                   the motive and spirit of his words and deeds."—The Acts of the

         Part 4      "Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great
      SELECTING things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth! And
        WORDS the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among
     James 3:5, 6 our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on
                  fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell."
                     How may we control our tongues? We say, "My tongue slipped."
                   Could this be an excuse for a lack of self-control? What motivates
                   anyone to gossip? A desire to show that he or she is better than
                   the subject of the gossiping? Do you think it possible that a person
                   might become a gossip to try to prove his own goodness?
                    How does man rate in controlling his tongue? James 3:8-12.
                   What then is the solution? Verses 17, 18.

                     Jesus taught His disciples to avoid the use of common oaths,
                   and to say just Yes or No. Matt. 5:33-37. A Christian's word should
                   be his bond. A simple Yes or No carries as much weight as a
                   more emphatic declaration.
                    What effect does the wrong use of words have on a person?
                   Matt 15:18.

                     Continual thought about an action opens the way for that action
                   to be carried out when the opportunity comes. Many have con-
                   quered their habit of smoking by repeating, "I choose not to
                   smoke." Thus we imprint upon the mind positive and helpful
                   actions. Unfortunately the reverse is also true.

THINK IT THROUGH     Am I ever guilty of ,gossip or slander? What about things that
                   are true but hurtful of others?



                     The tongue "has set nation against nation, and has caused
                   battle and bloodshed. Words have kindled fires that have been
                   hard to quench. They have also brought joy and gladness to many
                   souls. And when words are spoken because God says, 'Speak
                   unto them My words,' they often cause sorrow unto repentance.
                      "The talent of speech carries with it great responsibility. It needs
                   to be carefully guarded; for it is a mighty power for evil as well
                   as for good."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary,
                   Vol. 3, p. 1142.
                      "My brethren and sisters, how are you employing the gift of
                   speech? Have you learned so to control the tongue that it shall
                   ever obey the dictates of an enlightened conscience and holy
                   affections? Is your conversation free from levity, pride and malice,
                   deceit and impurity? Are you without guile before God? Words
                   exert a telling power. Satan will, if possible, keep the tongue active
                   in his service. Of ourselves we cannot control the unruly member.
                   Divine grace is our only hope."—Testimonies, Vol. 5, p. 175.

           Part 5    "The tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright: but the mouth
          WORDS of fools poureth out foolishness."
          ABOUT      "A man hath joy by the answer of his mouth: and a word
         WORDS spoken in due season, how good is it!"
   Prov. 15:2, 23
                     Consider the following contrasting qualities that words may pos-
                  sess:
                  Truth—Prov. 8:7                      Deceit—Prov. 12:5
                  Peace—Prov. 15:1                     Violence—Prov. 10:11
                  Deliverance—Prov. 12:6               Destruction—Prov. 10:14
                  Life—Prov. 18:21                     Death—Prov. 18:21
                  Understand i ng—Prov. 1:2            Perverseness—Prov. 15:4
                  Wisdom—Prov. 10:13                   Foolishness—Prov. 15:2
                  Righteousness—Prov. 8:8              Frowardness—Prov. 10:32
                      Some other comments about the nature of words: Rev.
                  21:5—Faithfulness; 1 Tim. 4:6—Doctrine; Eccl. 12:10—Accepta-
                  bility; Rom. 3:14—Bitterness; Jude 16—Complaining; 1 Cor.
                  2:4—Enticing.
                      "A soul filled with the love of Jesus lends to the words, the
                  manners, the looks, hope, courage and serenity. It reveals the
                  spirit of Christ. It breathes a love which will be reflected. It awakens
                  a desire for a better life; souls ready to faint are strengthened;
                  those struggling against temptation will be fortified and comforted.
                  The words, the expression, the manners throw out a bright ray
                   of sunshine, and leave behind them a clear path toward heaven,
                   the source of all light. Every one of us has opportunities of helping
                   others."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol.
                   3, p. 1156.
THINK IT THROUGH     Consider your own use of words in the home, to loved ones.
                    Am I always helpful in what I say?




                      "The voice and tongue are gifts from God, and if rightly used,
                    they are a power for God. Words mean very much. They may
                    express love, devotion, praise, melody to God, or hatred and
                    revenge. Words reveal the sentiments of the heart. They may be
                    a savor of life unto life or of death unto death. The tongue is
                    a world of blessing, or a world of iniquity."—Ellen G. White Com-
                    ments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 3, p. 1159.
                      "The infinite God alone can measure the mischief that is done
                    by careless words.... As professed Christians, we should consider
                    the influence our words have upon those with whom we come
                    into association, whether they are believers or unbelievers. Our
                    words are watched, and mischief is done by thoughtless utter-
                    ances. No after association with believers or unbelievers will wholly
                    counteract the unfavorable influence of thoughtless, foolish
                    words. Our words evidence the manner of food upon which the
                    soul feeds."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary,

   ALTERNATIVES      of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of
                IN   God. For I determined not to know any thing among you, save
 COMMUNICATION       Jesus Christ, and him crucified."
  1 Cor. 2:1, 2, 4     "And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words
                     of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of
                     power."

                       Paul renounced the use of oratory or brilliant debate to reach
                     the Corinthians. He knew he was going into a sophisticated city
                     where the skillful use of words would attract an audience.
                       "In neither private discussions nor public preaching did Paul
                     rely on the persuasive power found in human reasoning. He did
                     not seek to charm and captivate his hearers with the style of
                     subtile philosophy that so appealed to the Greeks."—SDA Bible

                       How were Paul's words about Jesus regarded by Christians
                     and Non-Christians? 1 Cor. 1:21-25. (See 2:5, 6.)

                       "In His love and pity for lost mankind, God proclaimed the glori-
                     ous news of salvation through faith in Christ. This news, which
                     to worldly-wise individuals was mere foolishness, became, for
                     those who accept it, God's chosen agency for redemption....
                       "The 'foolishness of preaching' is the announcement of the
                     gospel of salvation through faith in the crucified Christ, which
                     to the Greek and the unbelieving Jew seemed like sheer folly."

                      In persecution what promise assures God's help in our com-
                     munication? Luke 21:12-15.


THINK IT THROUGH       How is my church going about the business of communicating
                     the gospel? And what about my words? Have I chosen the
                     heavenly alternative?



                        "The experience of the apostle Paul in meeting the philosophers
                     of Athens has a lesson for us. In presenting the gospel before
                     the court of the Areopagus, Paul met logic with logic, science
                     with science, philosophy with philosophy. The wisest of his hearers
                     were astonished and silenced. His words could not be con-
                     troverted. But the effort bore little fruit. Few were led to accept
                     the gospel. Henceforth Paul adopted a different manner of labor.
                     He avoided elaborate arguments and discussion of theories, and
                     in simplicity pointed men and women to Christ as the Saviour
                     of sinners."—The Ministry of Healing, page 214.
                        "Read the first and second chapters of 1 Corinthians with deep
                     interest, and pray that God will give you understanding so that
                     you may comprehend and put into practice the truths there

                   exaltation."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 35.
                      Sin began with a perverted imagination. Lucifer imagined him-
                   self unfairly treated. He then arrived at wrong answers about God
                   and himself. Sin spread to other beings when Lucifer com-
                   municated to them his wrong conclusions.
                      Unfortunately Lucifer succeeded in communicating to Eve
                   thoughts of self-exaltation which she accepted. Her imagination
                   was thus perverted also. God had not treated her right, she
                   thought, in withholding the forbidden fruit. Thus sin entered the
                   universe and the world through perverted imagination and com-
                   munication. All barriers to communication that man faces evolve
                   from Satan's, and Eve's, false picture of God and self.

                     By what means can our minds be redirected? John 16:7-15.


THINK IT THROUGH    Am I aware of my true nature as a sinner? Do I understand
                   my true potential as a child of God?

                      "Oh, how much we lose by not educating the imagination to
                   dwell upon divine things, rather than upon the earthly! ... Fresh
                   wonders will be revealed to the mind the more closely we apply
                   it to divine things. We lose much by not talking more of Jesus
                   and of heaven, the saints' inheritance. The more we contemplate
                   heavenly things, the more new delights we shall see, and the
                   more will our hearts be brimful of thanks to our beneficent
                   Creator."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary,
                   Vol. 6, p. 1085.
                      "Self-esteem and self-flattery will be sure to stir up in the heart
                   resentment against any who venture to question one's course
                   of action. Everything like counsel or advice is resented with indig-
                   nation as a design to bruise and wound. This spirit cherished
                   will lead to numerous evils. None will venture to tell you when
                   you err, because the faithful one would be regarded as an enemy.
                   Thus the kindness that should exist between brethren in the faith
                   is killed because of the jealous interpretation put upon the God-
                   fearing cautions given. Undue stress is laid upon words, imagina-
                   tion exaggerates the matter and creates alienation."—Testimonies

                                                                        February 26
           Part 2    "For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also
    BARRIERS TO in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as
            MAN ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake."
     1 Thess. 1:5
                     "Ye know. Paul appeals to the Thessalonians' personal know-
                  ledge of the missionaries' behavior among them. A man must
                  have a clear conscience before making such an appeal to his
                  own conduct, but Paul never feared to quote his own behavior
                  among his converts. His several references to the life he lived
                  in Thessalonica (ch. 2:1, 2, 5, 9-11) may imply that some were
                  misrepresenting his behavior and endeavoring to weaken his influ-
                  ence. He met such misrepresentations by claiming that not only
                  the sermons but the lives of the evangelists preached the gospel,
                  and that this was done for the sake of the Thessalonians
                  themselves."--SDA Bible Commentary, on 1 Thess. 1:5.
                     To be effective, our communication with our fellowmen must
                  be in harmony with our behavior. Nothing raises barriers in a
                  listener faster than the feeling that he is being fooled or tricked,
                  or that the speaker cannot or will not do that which he admonishes
                  others to do.
                     Persons who are thus inconsistent show a similar inconsistency
                  in relation to God. "In taking upon themselves the solemn covenant
                  of the church they have pledged themselves to receive and obey
                  the word of God, to give themselves to God's service, but they
                  do not do this. In profession they claim to be sons of God, but
                  in life and character theydeny the relationship. Theydo not surren-
                  der the will to God. They are living a lie."—Christ's Object Lessons,
                  page 279. What barriers we sometimes erect!
                     What motivation should govern the Christian's communication
                   of truth? Eph. 4:15.


THINK IT THROUGH     How may a Christian diminish the barriers sin has erected
                   within his life?



                      "The same agencies that barred men away from Christ eighteen
                    hundred years ago are at work today. The spirit which built up
                    the partition wall between Jew and Gentile is still active. Pride
                    and prejudice have built strong walls of separation between differ-
                    ent classes of men. Christ and His mission have been misrep-
                    resented, and multitudes feel that they are virtually shut away
                    from the ministry of the gospel. But let them not feel that they
                    are shut away from Christ. There are no barriers which man or
                    Satan can erect but that faith can penetrate."—The Desire of Ages,
                    page 403.
                        The unstudied, unconscious influence of a holy life is the most
                    convincing sermon that can be given in favor of Christianity. Argu-
                    ment, even when unanswerable, may provoke only opposition;
                    but a godly example has a power that it is impossible wholly
                    to resist."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 511.

                        salvation. Therefore God puts them under a delusion, which

                        brought to judgement, all who do not believe the truth but make
                        sinfulness their deliberate choice."

                          These persons accept hope in the enemy. They look to him
                        for salvation. He is the Lie. These people are deluded. The lie
                        they believe prevents them from accepting the truth they are
                        offered. What evidences can you see that the lie is being practiced
                        today?
                          "God will not condemn any at the judgment because they hon-
                        estly believe a lie, or conscientiously cherished error; but it will
                        be because they neglected the opportunities of making themselves
                        acquainted with truth. The infidel will be condemned, not because
                        he was an infidel, but because he did not take advantage of the
                        means God has placed within his reach to enable him to become
                        a Christian."—Testimonies to Ministers, page 437.

Barriers to Effective Communication         LESSON 9                ❑ Wednesday
                                                                      February 28
            Part 4   "He that received the seed into stony places, the same is
    BARRIERS OF he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it; yet
        LIFE AND hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when
           HEART tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and
     CONDITIONS by he is offended. He also that received seed among the thorns
    Matt 13:20-22  is he that heareth the word; and the care of• this world, and
                   the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh
                   unfruitful."

                     This is a parable about barriers to lasting effectiveness in com-
                   municating the gospel. Note the emphasis on environment—both
                   external and self-created. Tribulation and persecution come from
                   without. The desire for money and concern about the world are
                   personal creations. Is it possible to raise a barrier to the Word
                   in one's own life by committing too much time, talent, or money
                   to matters of secondary importance? How should we destroy
                   environmental barriers?
                     How did racial and economic disparities affect the children
                   of Israel? Ex 6:9. What remedy does God propose for social
                   and material inequalities? Isa. 58:6-8.


                     What human conditions may confuse our judgment of the
                   importance of the individual? Eccl. 9:15, 16; James 2:1-4.

                     God's assessment of the worth of the indiidual disregards race
                   and creed and economic, social, or educational status.
THINK IT THROUGH     How can I learn to communicate effectively with persons on
                   the other side of a social barrier?




                      "No mere theory of truth or profession of discipleship will save
                   any soul. We do not belong to Christ unless we are His wholly.
                   It is by halfheartedness in the Christian life that men become
                   feeble in purpose and changeable in desire. The effort to serve
                   both self and Christ makes one a stony-ground hearer, and he
                   will not endure when the test comes upon him."—Christ's Object

                       "No class is free from the temptation to worldly care. To the
                   poor, toil and deprivation and the fear of want bring perplexities
                   and burdens. To the rich come fear of loss and a multitude of
                   anxious cares."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 51.
                       "Christ came to demolish every wall of partition, to throw open
                   every compartment of the temple, that every soul may have free
                   access to God. His love is so broad, so deep, so full, that it pene-

           13, 15     "While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not
                    your hearts, as in the provocation."

                       "An evil heart of unbelief. This has ever been the root of difficulty
                    in the matter of man's relation to God. Thus it was with Israel
                    in the wilderness, and later in the land of Canaan. This same
                    difficulty prevents nominal Christians today from entering into
                    the experience of 'rest' that is possible through genuine faith
                    in Christ Jesus. Israel's lack of faith stands in marked contrast
                    with the faithfulness of Moses and Christ (vs. 1, 2). . . .
                       "Christians are here admonished to beware of apostatizing in
                    their hearts 'from the living God,' the while they maintain the
                    forms of religion. The experiences through which ancient Israel
                    passed 'happened unto them for ensamples,' or, 'as lessons'
                    (1 Cor. 10:11), and 'were written down for our instruction'
                    (RSV). Christians who, upon reviewing the obduracy of ancient
                    Israel, consider themselves superior, will do well to heed the admo-
                    nition, 'Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall'
                    (1 Cor. 10:12; cf. vs. 1-10)."--SDA Bible Commentary, on Heb.

    Rev. 3:20-22 to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am
                  set down with my Father in his throne. He that hath an ear,
                  let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches."

                      Christ will not open the heart-door without our consent. "Says
                   the true Witness, 'Behold, I stand at the door and knock.' Every
                   warning, reproof, and entreaty in the Word of God, or through
                   His delegated messengers, is a knock at the door of the heart;
                   it is the voice of Jesus, asking for entrance. With every knock
                   unheeded, your determination to open becomes weaker and
                   weaker. If the voice of Jesus is not heeded at once, it becomes
                   confused in the mind with a multitude of other voices, the world's
                   care and business engross the attention, and conviction dies away.
                   The heart becomes less impressible, and lapses into a perilous
                   unconsciousness of the shortness of time, and of the great eternity

                      "The heavenly Guest is standing at your door, while you are
                   piling up obstructions to bar His entrance. Jesus is knocking
                   through the prosperity He gives you. He loads you with blessings
                   to test your fidelity, that they may flow out from you to others.
                   Will you permit your selfishness to triumph? Will you squander
                   God's talents, and lose your soul through idolatrous love of the
                   blessings He has given?"—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible
                   Commentary, Vol. 7, pp. 966, 967.

                   riers with the gospel in the last days? Rev. 18:1-4.

                     Tremendous social and political pressures will be linked with
                   religion to prevent the reception of the divine call. God's reply
                   to these satanic attempts to exclude the call to obey Him will
                   be mighty displays of His power. Unexpected advances will come
                   for God's cause.
                     What is the basic characteristic of a Christian? 1 John 4:14-17.


                     A loving person seeks to break down barriers that separate
                   him from others. He seeks ways to communicate constructively
                   with others because of their potential worth through redemption.

THINK IT THROUGH     Why does divine love need our assistance?

                       "Love is a heavenly attribute. The natural heart cannot originate
                   it. This heavenly plant only flourishes where Christ reigns supreme.
                   Where love exists, there is power and truth in the life. Love does
                   good and nothing but good. Those who have love bear fruit unto
                   holiness, and in the end everlasting life."—Ellen G. White Com-

The Family in Dialogue        LESSON 10                                    ❑ Sunday

                                                                              March 4
          Part 1     "Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the
     PARENTS IN church, and gave himself for it."
     THE FAMILY      "So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He
      Eph. 5:25, that loveth his wife loveth himself. For no man ever yet hated
          28, 29 his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the
                  Lord the church."
                     How did Christ love the church? 1 Peter 2:24. Is giving an
                   act of communication?

                      Marital love involves the most intimate, continuing, and com-
                   prehensive communication. This communication involves the
                   intellect and all the senses. From being two separate channels
                   with completely divergent output, they become one—not subor-
                   dinated, but each amplified by oneness with the other so that
                   the oneness they know is greater than the sum of the two parts
                   they were before.
                      "The home that is beautified by love, sympathy, and tenderness
                   is a place that angels love to visit, and where God is glorified."—The
                   Adventist Home, page 19.
                     Apply the characteristics of love in 1 Cor. 13:4-7 to the family.


                     How will the individuals in a family relate themselves to the
                   varying tensions and crises of the home?
                     Note how many of the problems love must face are linked with
                   problems of communication within the home.

THINK IT THROUGH     What is the source of love in the family? Is my dialogue first
                   with God?

                     "Hearts that are filled with the love of Christ can never get
                   very far apart. Religion is love, and a Christian home is one where
                   love reigns and finds expression in words and acts of thoughtful
                   kindness and gentle courtesy. ...
                     "In every family where Christ abides, a tender interest and love
                   will be manifested for one another; not a spasmodic love expressed
                   only in fond caresses, but a love that is deep and abiding."—The
                   Adventist Home, page 94.
                     "Love can no more exist without revealing itself in outward
                   acts than fire can be kept alive without fuel. You, Brother C, have
                   felt that it was beneath your dignity to manifest tenderness by
                   kindly acts and to watch for an opportunity to evince affection
                   for your wife by words of tenderness and kind regard. You are
                   changeable in your feelings and are very much affected by sur-
                   rounding circumstances....
                      "You think it beneath your dignity, Brother C, to manifest love,
                   to speak kindly and affectionately. All these tender words, you
                   think, savor of softness and weakness, and are unnecessary. But
                   in their place come fretful words, words of discord, strife, and

         Part 2       Right example is the first precept of Christian communication
        FAMILY     within the home. Children naturally imitate. What do they have
 COMMUNICATION     to imitate in your home?
                      Today children are encouraged to communicate with their
                   elders. A frank interchange of ideas between the generations
                   closes the so-called "generation gap." However, through wise
                   handling of the situation, maturity of judgment, and divine help,
                   the parent retains his proper authority. Nothing is gained by
                   children's teasing or parents' bullying. Words used to denounce
                   children or override their wishes without reason only provoke
                   them, and the family harmony is threatened with contention.
                      "The cause of division and discord in families and in the church
                   is separation from Christ. To come near to Christ is to come near
                   to one another. The secret of true unity in the church and in
                   the family is not diplomacy, not management, not a superhuman
                   effort to overcome difficulties—though there will be much of this
                   to do—but union with Christ."—The Adventist Home, page 179.
                      All too often there is failure to understand what other members
                   of the family are really saying by their words and actions. This
                   is a situation similar to Judah's alienation from God in Jeremiah's
                   day. They had eyes and ears but didn't grasp God's message.
                   Jer. 5:21. Eyes and ears sensitized by love and the Holy Spirit
                   will catch the message of the words and actions of others.
                     What attitude recommended by Paul for the Christian life can
                   fortify our consistent efforts in the family? Gal. 6:9.

THINK IT THROUGH     What are the symptoms of failure to listen? How may intercom-
                   munication within the family be improved in such areas as money
                   handling, discipline, standards, family rules?

                      "Every member of the family should realize that a responsibility
                   rests upon him individually to do his part in adding to the comfort

                    What quality should characterize the Christian's spoken com-
                   munication? Col. 4:6.


                     Parents should communicate continually with heaven in view.
                   The salvation of unbroken families is their purpose. When this
                   motivation grips the life, then words become supremely important.
                     What forms of communication do we have with God that can
                   also be used to communicate love and respect in the family?
                   Ps. 95:1, 2, 6, 7.

THINK IT THROUGH     Review the words you have spoken to your loved ones in
                   the past day. Assess your communication—manner and con-
                   tent—against true Christian principles.



                      "Tell the children that you want to help them to prepare for
                   a holy heaven, where all is peace, where not one jarring note
                   is heard. Be patient with them in their trials, which may look small
                   to you but which are large to them.. ..
                       "There will be no loud, angry talking in the home. The words
                   will be of a character to soothe and bless the hearer. . . . Take

                      In the few short years that Hannah and Elkanah had Samuel

                   family?
                      Or must I change these practices in order to let Him be heard?

                     "From the earliest times the faithful in Israel had given much
                   care to the education of the youth. The Lord had directed that
                   even from babyhood the children should be taught of His goodness
                   and His greatness, especially as revealed in His law, and shown
                   in the history of Israel. Song and prayer and lessons from the
                   Scriptures were to be adapted to the opening mind. Fathers and
                   mothers were to instruct their children that the law of God is
                   an expression of His character, and that as they received the princi-
                   ples of the law into the heart, the image of God was traced on
                   mind and soul. Much of the teaching was oral."—The Desire of

                                                                             March 8

          Part 5    "And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart,
     RELIGION IN and with all thy soul, and with all thy might. And these words,
     THE FAMILY which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart: and
      Deut. 6:5-7 thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt
                  talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou
                  walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou
                  risest up."
                     This sounds like conditioning children to believe in God. How
                   do you feel about indoctrinating children with Christian principles
                   and belief? Do you feel this is a good way to work? Or should
                   a child be left to mature and then decide for himself?
                     "If the mother fails in her duty to instruct, guide, and restrain,
                   her children will naturally accept the evil, and turn from the
                   good."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pages 572, 573.
                     "Family religion consists in bringing up the children in the nur-
                   ture and admonition of the Lord. Every one in the family is to
                   be nourished by the lessons of Christ, and the interest of each
                   soul is to be strictly guarded, in order that Satan shall not deceive
                   and allure away from Christ."—The Adventist Home, page 317.
                     Family worship plays a vital role in bringing the child to Christ.
                   Communicating Christ is not a sometime thing. Day by day, at
                   every opportunity, Christ must be revealed as the giver of life,
                   the forgiver of sins, and the source of all personal power.
                     What elements does Solomon recall of his childhood training?
                   Prov. 4:1-5.

THINK IT THROUGH     What am I doing to communicate Jesus to my family? Do I
                   provide literature, music, time, and opportunity that create a
                   climate in my home which is favorable to the discovery of Jesus?

                     "And it was not enough that the promised child should receive
                   a good legacy from the parents. This must be followed by careful
                   training and the formation of right habits. God directed that the
                   future judge [Samson] and deliverer of Israel should be trained
                   to strict temperance from infancy. He was to be a Nazarite from
                   his birth, thus being placed under a perpetual prohibition against
                   the use of wine or strong drink. The lessons of temperance, self-
                   denial, and self-control are to be taught to children even from
                   babyhood."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pages 561, 562.
                      "The more deeply to impress these truths upon all minds, the
                   great leader [iMoses] embodied them in sacred verse. This song
                   was not only istorical, but prophetic. While it recounted the won-
                   derful dealings of God with His people in the past, it also
                   foreshadowed the great events of the future, the final victory of
                   the faithful when Christ shall come the second time in power
                   and glory. The people were directed to commit to memory this
                    poetic history, and to teach it to their children and children's
                    children.... It was the duty of parents to so impress these words
                   upon the susceptible minds of their children that they might never
                   be forgotten."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pages 467, 468.

                     by redemption. They should be taught that all their powers of

                  and righteousness and truth;) proving what is acceptable unto
                  the Lord."

                      Much of the technological revolution that has produced the
                    electric society has been directed at communication. Beginning
                    with modern high-speed presses, inventive geniuses have pro-
                    duced telecommunications—telephone, wireless telegraphy,
                    radio, television, satellite relay—film, tape recorders, records, and
                    other communicative methods. Computers chatter to each other
                    about an individual's financial standing, his marital condition, how
                    many children he has, and so on. Never before has it been possible
                    for so many to know so much. The potential for conveying ideas
                    is limitless. But the Christian is concerned with the quality of
                    the communication.
                      What are the results of the unconsecrated life? How is this
                    related to the media? 2 Tim. 3:7, 13.

                     What circumstances resulted in the communications break-
                    down at the Tower of Babel? Gen. 11:4-7.


                      So many authorities clamor for attention, so many voices speak,
                    that people either tune out the messages or are frequently
                    deceived.

THINK IT THROUGH      List the number of communicative devices in your home; list
                    both according to type and the number of each type. How much
                    of the available information do you accept? Consider the total
                    number of impressions made on you through various media each
                    day.



                      "It was His purpose that as men should go forth to found nations
                    in different parts of the earth they should carry with them a know-
                    ledge of His will, that the light of truth might shine undimmed
                    to succeeding generations. . . . But they were unwilling to listen
                    to these unpalatable truths; they had no desire to retain God in
                    their knowledge; and by the confusion of tongues they were, in
                    a great measure, shut out from intercourse with those who might
                    have given them light."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 120.

                      Imagine a Western society cut off from the communications
                    media. Trucks would cease to roll; computers would give no infor-
                    mation about needed supplies; radio would tell us nothing. We
                    have become dependent on thousands of people who relay and
                    receive information through the modern communications media.
                      Perhaps if Christians could see how vitally they depend on the
                    communicative efforts of the Holy Spirit through prayer, the Bible,
                    and preaching, they would recognize what a disaster it would
                    be if these avenues were cut off.

                     What special agents of divine communication minister on
                    man's behalf? Heb. 1:7, 14.


                      "By angel messengers, earth is connected with heaven, and
                    all the deeds of men, whether good or evil, are open to the eye
                    of Infinite Justice."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 495.
                      Long before man evolved the total communications that enable
                    a man to step on the moon, God offered and made effective a
                    system of total spiritual communication. We are sobered by the
                    ability of a computer to store and retrieve information. Read what
                    God says of His communications. Ps. 33:13-15; 34:17, 18.
THINK IT THROUGH     Am I really connected with heaven? Am I in communication
                    with divine sources of information and power?



                       "Oh, that our brethren and sisters might value aright the truth!
                    Oh, that they might become sanctified by it! Oh, that they might
                    realize that upon them rests the responsibility of communicating
                    this truth to others! But they do not feel the importance of living
                    the truth, of being doers of the words of Christ. Many are self-
                    sufficient. They are not filled with the missionary spirit that should
                    animate the disciples of Christ. If they knew what it means to
                    have travail of soul for others, angels of God would work through
                    them to communicate a knowledge of the truth."—Testimonies,
                    Vol. 8, pp. 151, 152.
                       "For all created beings there is the one great principle of
                    life—dependence upon and co-operation with God. The relation-
                    ship existing in the pure family of God in heaven was to exist
                    in the family of God on earth.... This would have brought peace
                    and happiness. But the law that none 'liveth to himself' Satan
                    was determined to oppose. . . . He sought to make himself a
                    center of influence. It was this that incited rebellion in heaven,
                    and it was man's acceptance of this principle that brought sin

                  him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have
                  not bowed the knee to the image of Baal."

                     Modern society poses a puzzling paradox. A fantastic communi-
                   cations net ties us together; but simultaneously the beliefs and
                   conditions of the people in this society tend to isolate the individual
                   and the family unit. The isolation of the Christian extends into
                   the areas of morality and religious belief.
                     Mass media speak with many voices proposing the theories
                   of many minds insinuating against Biblical morality and openly
                   scorning Christian values. Some theologians predict a future for
                   the Christian church in which Christianity becomes an under-

                     We may appear to be isolated, alone; yet we are not alone.
                   We are part of the body of Christ—this lesson Elijah had to learn.
                     What last-day conditions may contribute to the isolation of
                   the individual who determines to live for Christ? 2 Tim. 3:1-5;
                   4:3, 4.


                     What assurance, given when some believers apostatized, can
                   reassure us today? 2 Tim. 2:19.


THINK IT THROUGH     Am I seeking the companionship of Christ and the communion
                   of the Holy Spirit? Do I make the most of the fellowship of the
                   saints that church meetings offer?

                      "Many are suffering from maladies of the soul far more than
                   from diseases of the body, and they will find no relief until they
                   shall come to Christ, the wellspring of life. Complaints of weari-
                   ness, loneliness, and dissatisfaction will then cease....
                      "If physicians and workers flatter themselves that they are to
                   find a panacea for the varied ills of their patients by supplying
                   them with a round of amusements similar to those which have
                   been the curse of their lives, they will be disappointed. Let not
                   these entertainments be placed in the position which the living
                   Fountain should occupy. The hungry, thirsty soul will continue
                   to hunger and thirst as long as it partakes of these unsatisfying
                   pleasures."—Testimonies, Vol. 4, p. 579.
                      "Not all in the world are lawless and sinful; not all have taken
                   sides with the enemy. God has many thousands who have not

             Part 4    "Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But
       INVOLVEMENT howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab
     2 Sam. 18:22, 23 said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast
                     no tidings ready? But howsoever, said he, let me run. And he
                     said unto him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain,
                     and overran Cushi."

                       Ahimaaz wanted to become involved. It mattered little what he
                    had to say, or that he had nothing to tell, just so long as he
                    was involved. His involvement lacked meaning. A quite usual situa-
                    tion in modern times is the reverse of the story of Ahimaaz—that
                    is, to have the message, but not run. Meaningful involvement
                    requires that one have the message and run with it.
                       Gutenberg's invention of printing greatly increased the possibil-
                    ity for widespread involvement with ideas, and with the movements
                    that grew out of them. Our own message is largely due to the
                    interest of our pioneers with the truth of Scriptures and then
                    involvement by preaching what they learned.
                       What differences mark the involvement possible today through
                    radio and television? What do on-the-spot cameras and satellite
                    relays permit us to do? How should this immediacy affect our
                    relationships to others?
                       "My brethren and sisters, visit those who live near you, and

                       What special communication did Paul receive? Acts 16:9, 10.


                       While communications media can never replace the prophetic
                     vision, they may in some instances perform the service that God
                     had to provide for miraculously in previous times. The media often
                     will inform the sensitive heart of the needs of distant lands today.
                       What kind of involvement does Christ require? Matt. 25:31-40.

THINK IT THROUGH      Where is my involvement? With selfish needs? With pleasant
                    tasks? Have I involved myself with real problems?

                    and do not realize the threatened danger. They should feel now,

                 the face of delay in setting up His kingdom He simply taught
                 the truth about His kingdom.
                    Modern technology provides fantastic techniques for accom-

                 money and men.
                    Yet poverty and pollution march side by side with great achieve-
                 ment. Dissatisfaction mounts as the possible mocks at the real.
                 "I want it, and I want it now," is the attitude that motivates many
                 persons both in and beyond the so-called "now generation." It
                 seems entirely possible to some that technology may usher in
                 a temporal millennium. Yet the Christian recognizes that because
                 of self-centeredness a golden era is possible only through divine
                 intervention.

                     technology of their day? Hab. 2:2; Heb. 13:22; 1 John 5:13.


THINK IT THROUGH        Am I supporting, in every way I can, the work of God which
                     is carried on through literature, radio, telephone, and television?




                        "The knowledge current in the world may be acquired; for all
                     men are God's property, and are worked by God to fulfill His
                     will in certain lines, even when they refuse the man Christ Jesus
                     as their Saviour. The way in which God uses men is not always
                     discerned, but He does use them. . . . The inventions of human
                     minds are supposed to spring from humanity, but God is behind
                     all. He has caused that the means of rapid traveling shall have
                     been invented, for the great day of His preparation."—Fundamen-

                        "When men do not make God first and last and best in everything,
                     when they do not give themselves to Him for the carrying out
                     of His purposes, Satan comes in, and uses in his service the minds
                     that, given to God, could achieve great good. Under his direction,
                     they do an evil work with great and masterly power. God designed
                     them to work on a high plane of action, to enter into His mind,
                      and thus to acquire an education that would enable them to work
                     the works of righteousness."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA

Worldwide Witness       LESSON 12                                   ❑    Wednesday
                                                                          March 21
          Part 4    "How then shall they call on him in whom they have not
            THE believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have
     BEAUTIFUL not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? and
           FEET how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written,
   Rom. 10:14, 15 How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of
                  peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!"
                     In Romans 10 Paul considers the question of why Israel failed
                   to arrive at righteousness by faith. Who or what was to blame?
                   He concludes that it was not because they did not hear or under-
                   stand the gospel. It was because they were rebellious. Verse 21.
                   In the process of his argument he states some principles that
                   are applicable to the work of the gospel in any age. No one calls
                   on God unless he believes. No one believes unless he hears. No
                   one hears without a preacher. No one preaches without a commis-
                   sion. This week's lesson began with a study of the commission
                   Jesus has given to believers to teach the gospel worldwide. The
                   modern believer has a number of means to send out the Word—
                   printed materials, radio, telephone, television, films, and tapes.
                   While these inventions are helpful, the consecrated believer under
                   the Spirit's power will always be the prime means of witness.
                   All electronic and mechanical communications devices are merely
                   extensions of the living believer.

                     What symbols were presented to John to represent the inten- -
                   sity with which the last message would be given to the world?
                   Rev. 18:1, 2.


                     What indicates the divine origin of the message? Rev. 18:1.

THINK IT THROUGH     Have I committed myself through time, talent, and means to
                   the global task of the church?


                     "Thus the message of the third angel will be proclaimed. As
                   the time comes for it to be given with greatest power, the Lord
                   will work through humble instruments, leading the minds of those
                   who consecrate themselves to His service."—The Great
                   Controversy, page 606.
                      "The prophecies in the eighteenth of Revelation will soon be
                   fulfilled. During the proclamation of the third angel's message,
                   'another angel' is to 'come down from heayen, having great power,'
                   and the earth is to be 'lightened with his glory.' The Spirit of
                   the Lord will so graciously bless consecrated human instrumen-
                   talities that men, women, and children will open their lips in praise
                   and thanksgiving, filling the earth with the knowledge of God,
                   and with His unsurpassed glory, as the waters cover the sea.
                      "Those who have held the beginning of their confidence firm
                   unto the end will be wide awake during the time that the third
                   angel's message is proclaimed with great power."—Ellen G. White

                                                                            March 22

           Part 5     "Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ,
     THE CHURCH and stewards of the mysteries of God. Moreover it is required
     A SPECTACLE in stewards, that a man be found faithful."
       1 Car. 4:1,    "For we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels,
              2, 9 and to men."
                     It was the apostles that Paul considered to be a "spectacle
                   to the world," but it is also true of every person who believes
                   in Jesus Christ.
                     The media have power to create images favorable and unfavor-
                   able. An event or a person can achieve prominence or notoriety
                   in a matter of hours. We may feel that what happens in our homes,
                   our churches, our schools, our constituencies is our business.
                   But it may rapidly become more than just the business of the
                   community; it may concern a whole nation or even the world.
                     We cannot avoid the penetrating eye of the news or television
                   camera, or escape the skilled pen of the news writer, or the
                   authoritative voice of the newscaster. The potential of exposure
                   always exists.
                      What will be exposed? The good deeds of the church? Or some
                   misdemeanor? No longer is it possible for us to show one face
                   to the public, another to our communion. Only in Christian consis-
                   tency and the highest possible principle can we be secure under
                   the scrutiny of the world.
                     As with Judah, what reputation should the church of God have?
                   Isa. 62:12.


                    What influence did one good man, Barnabas, have on a com-
                   munity? Acts 11:22-24.


THINK IT THROUGH     Is there anything in my life that would bring disgrace on the
                   church or my family? Whose example have I taken for my life?


                     "Multitudes in the world are witnessing this game of life, the
                   Christian warfare. And this is not all. The Monarch of the universe
                   and the myriads of heavenly angtls are spectators of this race;
                   they are anxiously watching to see who will be successful over-
                   corners and win the crown of glory that fadeth not away."—
                   Testimonies, Vol. 4, p. 34.
                      "Where is the self-denial, where is the cross-bearing that Christ
                   has said should characterize His followers? The reason we have
                   had so little influence upon unbelieving relatives and associates
                   is that we have manifested little decided difference in our practices
                   from those of the world. . . . When we reach the standard that
                   the Lord would have us reach, worldlings will regard Seventh-day
                   Adventists as odd, singular, strait-laced extremists. 'We are made
                   a spectacle unto the world, and to angles, and to men.' "—Funda-

                 How shall we reach into the towers of apartments locked against
                 callers?
                   Yet the challenge still remains. Mark 16:20; Matt. 24:14.
                    "Let every worker in the Master's vineyard, study, plan, devise
                 methods, to reach the people where they are. We must do some-
                 thing out of the common course of things. We must arrest the
                 attention. We must be deadly in earnest. We are on the very verge
                 of times of trouble and perplexities that are scarcely dreamed
                 of."—Evangelism, pages 122, 123.
                   During the time of God's grace we must never forsake door-
                 to-door evangelism. Those who join our communion will do so
                 largely through a final personal witness. But, "the seed has been
                 sown, and now it will spring up and bear fruit. The publications
                 distributed by missionary workers have exerted their influence,
                 yet many whose minds were impressed have been prevented from
                 fully comprehending the truth or from yielding obedience."—The
                 Great Controversy, page 612.

                     What will be the result of the preaching of the gospel through-
                   out history? Rev. 7:9.


THINK IT THROUGH     Am I neglecting personal witness in favor of witness by proxy
                   through literature, evangelistic efforts, radio, television? How
                   important is an active personal witness?




                      "The commission given to the disciples is given also to us.
                   To-day, as then, a crucified and risen Saviour is to be uplifted
                   before those who are without God and without hope in the world.
                   The Lord calls for pastors, teachers, and evangelists. From door
                   to door His servants are to proclaim the message of salvation.
                   To every nation, kindred, tongue, and people the tidings of pardon
                   through Christ are to be carried. Not with tame, lifeless utterances
                   is the message to be given, but with clear, decided, stirring utter-
                   ances. Hundreds are waiting for the warning to escape for their
                   lives. The world needs to see in Christians an evidence of the
                   power of Christianity. Not merely in a few places, but throughout
                   the world, messages of mercy are needed."—Gospel Workers,
                   page 29.
                       The time of God's destructive judgments is the time of mercy
                   for those who have no opportunity to learn what is truth. Tenderly
                   will the Lord look upon them. His heart of mercy is touched;
                   His hand is still stretched out to save, while the door is closed
                   to those who would not enter. Large numbers will be admitted
                   who in these last days hear the truth for the first time."—Ellen

     THE SOURCE
     John 15:4, 5     "Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit
                    of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except
                    ye abide in me. I am the vine, ye are the branches: he that
                    abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit:
                    for without me ye can do nothing."

                       To be effective in communicating Jesus to others, the Christian
                    must be completely identified with the source of his faith.
                       "Not all the beauty of art can bear comparison with the beauty
                    of temper and character to be revealed in those who are Christ's
                    representatives. It is the atmosphere of grace which surrounds
                    the soul of the believer, the Holy Spirit working upon mind and
                    heart, that makes him a savor of life unto life, and enables God
                    to bless his work."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 298.
                       Examples of this close mutual union of Jesus and the believer
                    may be seen in the lives of Paul, Peter, Daniel, and many others.
                    We know from their experiences that what God promises can
                    become a reality. No endeavor is more valuable than seeking iden-
                    tity with the Source of life and power.
                      Study Christ's prayer in John 17. Why is oneness with Christ
                    and, through Him, with the Father vital? Verses 21, 23.


THINK IT THROUGH      Is Christ so closely identified with my life that others see Him
                    in me?




                      "Christian unity consists in the branches being in the same
                    parent stock, the vitalizing power of the center supporting the
                    grafts that have united to the Vine. In thoughts and desires, in
                    words and actions, there must be an identity with Christ, a constant
                    partaking of His spiritual life. . . . As communion with God is
                    making its impress upon the soul, and shining out in the counte-
                    nance as an illuminating light, the steadfast principles of Christ's

                       "Believers become one in Christ; but one branch cannot be
                    sustained by another. The nourishment must be obtained through
                    vital connection with the Vine. We must feel our utter dependence
                    on Christ. We must live by faith in the Son of God. That is the
                    meaning of the injunction, 'Abide in me.' The life we live in the
                    flesh is not to the will of men, not to please our Lord's enemies,
                    but to serve and honor Him who loved us, and gave Himself for
                    us. A mere assent to this union, while the affections are not
                    detached from the world, its pleasures and its dissipations, only
                    emboldens the heart in disobedience."—Ellen G. White Com-

            Part 2      "Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as
           GOD'S I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth
         MESSAGE rise up and walk."
      MY MESSAGE       "And his name through faith in his name hath made this man
       Acts 3:6, 16 strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him
                    hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you
                     all."
                       The greatest miracle of that day was not the healed feet and
                    ankles but the redirection of the beggar's life from selfish concern
                    with money to faith in God. How was this accomplished? By what
                    Peter and John had to give.
                       What attributes of Peter's message to the cripple assured effec-
                    tive communication? How does personal experience strengthen
                    communication of that experience?
                       Take time to look at several personal expressions of God's mes-
                    sage to man as spoken by some New Testament witnesses.
                       John 3:16—Christ to Nicodemus
                       Acts 2:39, 40—Peter to the polyglot crowd at Pentecost
                       Acts 7:56—Stephen to his enemies
                       Acts 16:31—Paul to the jailer
                       Acts 17:27-31—Paul on Mars' Hill
                       Note Paul's use of his personal experience to appeal to his
                    listeners: Felix, Acts 24; Agrippa, Acts 26.
                      To whom did Paul and the Judean believers attribute his
                    changed life? Gal. 1:15, 16, 23, 24.


                      What three things do we know through our faith in Jesus?
                    1 John 5:18-20.


                     John speaks repeatedly of knowledge through belief in God's
                    Son. This epistle is a book about true knowledge;
THINK IT THROUGH      Is the "message" an external to be wondered at and listened
                    to, or has it become identified with my way of living?

                       "The people of God have accustomed themselves to think that
                    they must rely upon their own efforts, that little help is to be
                    received from heaven; and the result is that they have little light
                    to communicate to other souls who are dying in error and dark-
                    ness. . . . They are not able to present the great and glorious
                    truths of God's Holy Word that would convict and convert souls
                    through the agency of the Holy Spirit. The power of God awaits
                    their demand and reception."—Testimonies to Ministers, page 175.
                       "In the presence of this great incident every Christian must
                    ask himself, What have I to give? One cannot give what he has
                    not received, nor can he truly give from an ungenerous heart.
                    He cannot give of Christ when he does not possess Christ. But
                    when he has Christ, he knows it, and cannot too quickly share
                    his precious gift with others."—SDA Bible Commentary, on Acts

           Part 3    "But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine."
  TRANSFERRING       "In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doc-
   THE MESSAGE trine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity, sound speech,
   Titus 2:1, 7, 8 that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part
                   may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you."
                     We give the divine message by (1) the soundness of the truth
                   we teach, (2) our deeds and attitudes, (3) living the message we
                   believe, (4) well-chosen words and thoughts. Truth is built upon
                   God's Word.John 17:17. Our deeds must be judged by the standard
                   of God's will. Sincerity springs from true repentance and complete
                   denial of double standards. 2 Cor. 7:9-11. Our words need divine
                   seasoning. Col. 4:6.

                    When Hezekiah gave the wrong message to a heathen prince,
                   what tragedy resulted? 2 Kings 20:12-18.


                     "What have your friends and acquaintances seen in your house?
                   Are you, instead of revealing the treasures of the grace of Christ,
                   displaying those things that will perish with the using? Or do
                   you, to those with whom you are brought in contact, communicate
                   some new thought of Christ's character and work? Have you
                   always some fresh revelation of His pitying love to impart to those
                   who know Him not?"—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible
                   Commentary, Vol. 2, p. 1038.
                     What response did a faithful witness bring? 2 King6 5:1-5,
                   14.


THINK IT THROUGH     How can I improve the signals I give to the world so that
                   I will display the love of God more accurately?

                     "The conduct of the captive maid, the way that she bore herself
                   in that heathen home, is a strong witness to the power of early
                   home training.. ..
                      "We know not in what line our children may be called to serve.
                   They may spend their lives within the circle of the home; they
                   may engage in life's common vocations, or go as teachers of
                   the gospel to heathen lands; but all are alike called to be mis-
                   sionaries for God, ministers of mercy to the world."—Prophets
                   and Kings, page 245.
                      "When mind and heart are filled with the love of God, it will
                   not be difficult to impart that which enters into the spiritual life.
                    Great thoughts, noble aspirations, clear perceptions of truth,
                    unselfish purposes, yearnings for piety and holiness, will find
                    expression in words that reveal the character of the heart treasure.
                     "The true follower of Christ strengthens the good purposes
                   of all with whom he comes in contact. Before an unbelieving,
                   sin-loving world he reveals the power of God's grace and the
                   perfection of His character."—Prophets and Kings, pages 347,

                                                                       March 28
            Part 4    "And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple,
           CLEAR and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat
         CHANNEL with gladness and singleness of heart, praising God, and having
          POWER favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church
      Acts 2:46, 47 daily such as should be saved."
                      Channels for the gospel may be living or inanimate. God blesses
                   the spoken and the written word. We are to let the message of
                   God's love flow through us—directly to others, or indirectly
                   through the technology God has placed in our hands. But as
                   the message passes through our hearts and minds it takes on
                   the special characteristics that our personality and training give
                   it. When we become channels for the love of God, it is our duty
                   to direct its flow toward needy individuals and a needy world.
                   What if the channel is clogged with sin and hypocrisy?"—
                   Testimonies, Vol. 6, p. 382.
                     What is the source of power in the gospel message? Rom.
                   1:16, 17.


                     "The greatest men of the earth are not beyond the power of
                   a wonder-working God. If those who are workers together with
                   Him will do their duty bravely and faithfully, God will convert men
                   who occupy responsible places, men of intellect and influence.
                   Through the power of the Holy Spirit, many will be led to accept
                   the divine principles."—The Ministry of Healing, page 216.

                    What group does not recognize the power of the gospel story?
                   Who does recognize it? 1 Cor. 1:18, 23, 24.

THINK IT THROUGH     What special characteristic does my experience, my training,
                   give to the gospel? Am I developing my potential ability by study
                   and practice?


                     "Higher than the highest human thought can reach is God's
                   ideal for His children. Godliness—godlikeness—is the goal to be
                   reached. Before the student there is opened a path of continual
                   progress. He has an object to achieve, a standard to attain, that
                   includes everything good, and pure, and noble. He will advance
                   as fast and as far as possible in every branch of true knowledge.
                   But his efforts will be directed to objects as much higher than
                   mere selfish and temporal interests as the heavens are higher
                   than the earth."—Education, pages 18, 19.
                     "After the disciples had received the baptism of the Holy Spirit,
                   the priests and rulers marveled at the words which they spake,
                   for they knew them as unlearned and ignorant men. But they
                   took knowledge of them that they had been with Jesus.
                     "Their teaching was a second edition of the teachings of Christ,
                   the utterance of simple, grand truths that flashed light into dark-
                   ened minds, and converted thousands in a day."—Ellen G. White

                                                                             March 29
           Part 5     "And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it:
        TROUBLE     but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you. And
       WITH THE     whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when
      RECEIVER?     ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your
  Matt. 10:13, 14   feet."         •

                      Why is it that our preaching and teaching do not convert every
                    person whom we approach? Is the fault in the message? Is the
                    fault always in those to whom we witness by word and deed?
                    Sometimes we have seen one preacher fail in a particular soul-
                    winning responsibility and another succeed under seemingly
                    similar circumstances.
                      Yet not everyone will receive the word gladly. Some are deluded.
                    2 Thess. 2:11, 12. Some scoff. 2 Peter 3:3, 4. Some prefer evil.
                    2 Tim. 4:3, 4. When faced with problems like these, God's workers
                    may well need to seek more receptive ears. The communication
                    of truth has not been effective. The channel is blocked.
                      What was the result of Jesus' work among people unrespon--
                    sive to His message? Matt. 13:58.

THINK IT THROUGH      Dare I dismiss anyone as beyond salvation?




                       "As the preaching of Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so
                    Christ's preaching was a sign to His generation. But what a con-
                    trast in the reception of the word! Yet in the face of indifference
                    and scorn the Saviour labored on and on, until He had accom-
                    plished His mission."—Prophets and Kings, page 274.
                       "God's messengers in the great cities are not to become d iscour-
                    aged over the wickedness, the injustice, the depravity, which they
                    are called upon to face while endeavoring to proclaim the glad
                    tidings of salvation. The Lord would cheer every such worker
                    with the same message that He gave to the apostle Paul in wicked
                    Corinth: 'Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace: for
                    I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for
                    I have much people in this city.' Acts 18:9, 10. Let those engaged
                    in soul-saving ministry remember that while there are many who
                    will not heed the counsel of God in His word, the whole world
                    will not turn from light and truth, from the invitations of a patient,
                    forbearing Saviour."—Prophets and Kings, page 277.

           Part 6     "And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased
ROUND-THE-CLOCK     not to teach and preach Jesus Christ."
 COMMUNICATION        "Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three
       Acts 5:42;   years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears."
            20:31
                       Unfortunately many of Christ's followers turn on the transmitter
                    only on Sabbath. Then they exude sanctity and piety. But through
                    the week they forget their Christian calling. They may live good
                    lives, but their witness is blunted by pressures of business or
                    by fear.
                       "Go to the homes of those even who manifest no interest. While
                    mercy's sweet voice invites the sinner, work with every energy
                    of heart and brain, as did Paul.. ..
                       "Carry the Word of God to every man's door, urge its plain
                    statements upon every man's conscience, repeat to all the
                    Saviour's command, 'Search the Scriptures.' "—Evangelism, page

                       What counsel does Solomon give regarding his proverbs that
                    is pertinent to all of God's messages? Prov. 22:17-20. For what
                    purpose are these words given? Vs. 20, 21.

                      In what condition are we to live? 1 Peter 3:15.

                      We may not look on ourselves as very powerful transmitters
                    of the divine message. We may be all too aware of our lack of
                    ability and training, or of character defects and weaknesses in
                    our makeup. But God will bless the humblest Christian that seeks
                    to be a living communication of His truth.
THINK IT THROUGH      Consider the familiar story of the talents. Do we have the
                    right to cease our witness?

                      "The secret of success is the union of divine power with human

Not all love letters are meant to be tied up in a
pink bow and tucked away in the attic. Some love
letters should be kept near and read often. Not all
of them say the things we want them to say. Be-
cause, sometimes, when we truly love people, we
have to say things that hurt in order to help.
Ellen White understood love. She wrote many let-
ters. Some of them hurt very much. But they were
all written in a true spirit of love and were de-
signed to help us. Ellen White's love letters are the
kind that should be kept near. And read often.

Does Somebody want
our attention? \\




How does a holy, perfect God communicate Himself to fallen human
beings? And how does one man, in turn, tell another fellowman
what God is like? W. R. L. Scragg explores these questions in THE
MEDIA, THE MESSAGE, AND MAN, written especially to supplement
this quarter's Sabbath School lessons.
Elder Scragg reveals the different ways God has used to communi-
cate to man. Then he shows how we must use every available
means of transmitting to others what God has revealed about Him-
self. Scragg discusses the different problems that hinder communi-
cation and explains how God and man work to overcome them.
Each chapter of THE MEDIA, THE MESSAGE, AND MAN is keyed to
the Sabbath School lessons. The different subjects and points dis-
cussed have the same topic headings as those used in the lessons.
