         Thirteenth Sabbath Overflow Offering
              March 30, 1974—Afro-Mideast Division

    It is not difficult to write to the members of our worldwide Sabbath
School family. We know each other pretty well. We support each other
and encourage each other to the best of our ability. When the Afro-
Mideast Division therefore comes to you this quarter with earnest re-
quests for financial help, we are confident that you will help us.
    We have chosen three projects that will benefit from your gifts at the
end of this quarter. Not that we could not have come up with more
 projects, for we could; but rather we thought that we should concentrate
on these three, which are:
   1. A mission station in West Ethiopia. The plan is that this particular
station should be placed close to the border with Sudan. This is the
part of old Ethiopia where so many thousands of souls have been won
for God's kingdom recently. This is where the field president baptized
more than 1,500 souls last year, largely won by our faithful laymembers.
    2. A seminary for Tanzania. We urgently need an evangelistic train-
ing center in Tanzania. A beautiful location has already been secured
for this purpose. It lies in the highland some 15 miles from the town of
Arusha. When this property became available, our local administration
took advantage of it in anticipation of what the special Thirteenth Sab-
bath Overflow Offering will bring in. The funds will transform the prop-
erty into a Seminary.
   3. A health center in Manama, Bahrain. This, we believe, will be ac-
cording to the "blueprint." Already much planning and preparation has
gone into this project. The Middle East Union is looking with great ex-
pectation to the day when this project will be realized and another door
entered.
   So on behalf of the many thousands of us out here, I say: Thank you
for your constant liberality. Thank you for easing our burdens by giving
a really good Thirteenth Sabbath Offering.

                   CHRIST OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS
                              General Introduction
     An outstanding characteristic of today's society is lawlessness, and a common
 teaching by Christian churches is that the law of God is no longer binding on men.
 Seventh-day Adventists believe that the way of life as God has revealed it is faith
 in Jesus leading to obedience to the commandments. It is the keeping of the
 "commandments of God and the faith of Jesus" that John the Revelator saw would
 characterize the saints in the last days. This message is particularly pertinent in
 today's world. It is precisely the remedy for the ills of our world and of the church
 that arise out of a negative attitude toward law.
      The title of this quarter's lessons, "Christ our Righteousness," reflects this
  double, but inseparable, concern. It is a study of Christ who points us to the law,
  which is the definition of righteousness, and of the law that points us to Christ who
  is the only means by which the sinner can be in harmony with the law.
      There is the constant risk that the proper relation between Christ and law shall
  not be recognized in a study of salvation by faith. It is this perspective of Christ in
  the law that is a root concept of the message we are proclaiming to the world. To
  remove, or tone down, the claims of the law will result in a sentimental religion,
  claiming Jesus as Lord, but failing to do His will. To remove, or tone down, the
  truth of salvation by faith in Jesus will result in a legalistic religion in which the
  believer is in the hopeless situation of seeking salvation by his own deeds.
      Ellen G. White has stated the true relation between Jesus and the law as follows:
      "Christ bore the curse of the law, suffering its penalty, carrying to completion
  the plan whereby man was to be placed where he could keep God's law, and
   be accepted through the merits of the Redeemer; and by His sacrifice glory was
  shed upon the law....
       "Christ is the sinner's advocate. Those who accept His gospel behold Him with
   open face. They see the relation of His mission to the law, and they acknowledge
   God's wisdom and glory as revealed by the Saviour. The glory of Christ is revealed
   in the law, which is a transcript of His character, and His transforming efficacy is
   felt upon the soul until men become changed to His likeness. They are made
   partakers of the divine nature, and grow more and more like their Saviour, advanc-
   ing step by step in conformity to the will of God, till they reach perfection.
       "The law and the gospel are in perfect harmony. Each upholds the other. In
   all its majesty the law confronts the conscience, causing the sinner to feel his
   need of Christ as the propitiation for sin. The gospel recognizes the power and
   immutability of the law. 'I had not known sin, but by the law,' Paul declares (Rom.
   7:7). The sense of sin, urged home by the law, drives the sinner to the Saviour.
, In his need man may present the mighty arguments furnished by the cross of
   Calvary. He may claim the righteousness of Christ; for it is imparted to every
 'repentant sinner."—Selected Messages, Bk. 1, pp. 240, 241.
       During this quarter we invite your careful study of Jesus and the law of God.

          The Blessing of Daily Study
   "Every day some portion of time should be appropri-
ated to the study of the lessons, not merely in learning to
mechanically repeat the words, while the mind does not
comprehend the meaning; but to go to the very founda-
tion, and become familiar with what is brought out in the
lesson."—"Counsels on Sabbath School Work," page 53.




                       My Pledge
   As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge
of the Scriptures, I pledge myself to the careful and
prayerful study of some portion of my Sabbath School
lesson each day of the week.

     become righteous only as they have faith in God and
     maintain a vital connection with Him. Then true godliness
     will elevate the thoughts and ennoble the life. Then the
     external forms of religion accord with the Christian's internal
     purity. Then the ceremonies required in the service of God
     are not meaningless rites, like those of the hypocritical
     Pharisees."— The Desire of Ages, page 310.

                                                                          December 30

              Part 1     The first use of one of the forms of the Hebrew word in the
         MEANING OF Old Testament which is translated as "righteous" or "righ-
                      teousness" is in Gen. 7:1.
      RIGHTEOUSNESS
             Gen. 7:1    "And the Lord said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy
                       house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me
                       in this generation."

                          Noah is here called "righteous" and all the rest of the world
                       were living in wickedness. (Gen. 6:5, 8.) Throughout the Bible
                       the words "wickedness" and "righteousness" are used for
                       opposite meanings.
                          What does John point to as the evidence of a righteous
                       person? 1 John 3:7.

                           While the context of a word must determine its particular
                       shade of meaning, a word has a basic meaning that can be
                       stated objectively, as in a dictionary. The idea of "righteous-
                       ness" is right conduct with reference to a norm, and "wicked-
                       ness" is wrong conduct in relation to the same norm.
                           "Righteousness is right doing, and it is by their deeds that
                       all will be judged. Our characters are revealed by what we do.
                       The works show whether the faith is genuine."—Christ's Ob-
                       ject Lessons, page 312.
                          Note the use of the words "righteous" and "wicked" in
                       Ezekiel 33:18, 19.

    THINK IT THROUGH      How can I see my conduct as God sees it?

                           "The reason why God's people are not more spiritually
                       minded and have not more faith, I have been shown, is be-
                       cause they are narrowed up with selfishness. . . . It is not the
                       abundance of your meetings that God accepts. It is not the
                       numerous prayers, but the right-doing, doing the right thing
                       and at the right time. It is to be less self-caring and more
                       benevolent. Our souls must expand. Then God will make them
                       like a watered garden, whose waters fail not."—Testimonies,
                       Vol. 2, p. 36.
                           "Righteousness is holiness, likeness to God, and 'God is
                       love.' 1 John 4:16. It is conformity to the law of God, for 'all
                       Thy commandments are righteousness' (Psalm 119:172), and
                       'love is the fulfilling of the law' (Romans 13:10). Righteousness
                       is love, and love is the light and the life of God. The righteous-
                       ness of God is embodied in Christ. We receive righteousness
                       by receiving Him."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing,

                                                                      December 31

           Part 2   What, according to the psalmist, constitutes, righteousness?
  DESCRIPTION OF    "My tongue shall speak of thy word: for all thy command-
                  ments are righteousness."
  RIGHTEOUSNESS
      Ps. 119:112
                        "Righteousness is defined by the standard of God's holy
                    law, as expressed in the ten precepts given on Sinai."—Steps
                    to Christ, page 61.
                        "God has a law, and it is the great standard of righteous-
                    ness. Everyone who has presumed upon the mercy of God,
                    and practiced iniquity, will be judged according to his works."
                    —Testimonies to Ministers, page 448.
                        Thus the norm for the right conduct of the believer is the
                     law of God. This righteousness is not based on what appears
                     to man to be right-doing, but on the revelation of a universal
                     principle expressed in the Ten Commandments.

                      What principle, as Jesus pointed out, underlies the law?
                    Mark 12:30, 31.

                       It is the same to speak of loving conduct as to speak of
                    right conduct, but love as defined by God's law.
                       "We are not to be dwarfed in any kind of service for God.
                    Whatever He has lent us is to be used intelligently for Him.
                    The man who exercises his faculties will surely strengthen
                    them; but he must seek to do his best. There is need of intelli-
                    gence and educated ability to devise the best methods in
                    farming, in building, and in every other department, that the
                    worker may not labor in vain....
                        "It is the duty of every worker not merely to give his strength
                    but his mind and intellect to that which he undertakes to do."
                    —Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 5,
                    p. 1112.

 THINK IT THROUGH      What is the result of comparing my conduct with the spir-
                    itual meaning of the law?

                       "God requires at this time just what He required of the holy
                    pair in Eden, perfect obedience to His requirements. His law
                    remains the same in all ages. The great standard of righteous-
                    ness presented in the Old Testament is not lowered in the
                    New. It is not the work of the gospel to weaken the claims of
                    God's holy law, but to bring men up where they can keep its
                    precepts."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary,

               Part 3      "He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love."
          SOURCE OF          "God is love. The Greek construction does not make 'God'
     RIGHTEOUSNESS      and 'love' identical as the English translation may appear to
           1 John 4:8   do. Rather love is set forth as an essential quality or attribute
                        of God. The decisive proof that a man that 'loveth not' lacks a
                         knowledge of God is contained in the phrase 'God is love.' He
                        who does not love proves that he is not personally acquainted
                        with the basic quality in God's nature. In his simple but sub-
                        lime statement John reaches the zenith of Christian belief."
                        —SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 7, p. 664.
                            Yesterday we noted that the law is based on love. Add to
                        that the fact that God is love and it becomes clear that in God's
                        law there was put into words the principle of God's character.
                        The law reflects to man what God is like, and as man keeps
                        God's law by His grace, he becomes Godlike.
                            "God's law is the transcript of His character. It embodies
                        the principles of His kingdom. He who refuses to accept these
                        principles is placing himself outside the channel where God's
                        blessings flow."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 305.
                           The purpose of the law is not that it be a thing in itself, but
                        rather that the believer accept it as the voice of God, as it was
                        really given on Sinai, the expression of God's personal will
                        for all mankind.
                           "The law is to be presented to its transgressors, not as
                        something apart from God, but rather as an exponent of His
                        mind and character. As the sunlight cannot be separated from
                        the sun, so God's law cannot be rightly presented to man apart
                        from the divine Author."—Selected Messages, Bk. 1, p. 371.
                           Man cannot understand the law if he looks at it as a code
                        standing alone.
                           "Those who study this lesson [of the good Samaritan] aright
                        will see that in order to keep the law it is necessary to have
                        a knowledge of God; for the law is a transcript of his charac-
                        ter, and his character is love."—Ellen G. White, Review and
                        Herald, Sept. 13, 1906.
                           The true revelation of righteousness comes through the
                        combination of the law and the knowledge of God. Tomorrow
                        we will note that the knowledge of God comes through Jesus.

 THINK IT THROUGH          How can I know what is right conduct and do it?

                           "Christ bore the curse of the law, suffering its penalty,
                        carrying to completion the plan whereby man was to be placed
                        where he could keep God's law, and be accepted through the
                        merits of the Redeemer; and by His sacrifice glory was shed
                        upon the law."—Selected Messages, Bk. 1, p. 240.

Righteousness LESSON 1                                              ❑ Wednesday
                                                                       January 2

           Part 4      What revelation was made by the life of Jesus?
       JESUS AND       "Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you,
  RIGHTEOUSNESS     and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen
        John 14:9   me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us
                    the Father?"
                        "Christ alone was able to represent the Deity. He who had
                    been in the presence of the Father from the beginning, He who
                    was the express image of the invisible God, was alone suffi-
                    cient to accomplish this work. No verbal description could
                    reveal God to the world. Through a life of purity, a life of
                    perfect trust and submission to the will of God, a life of humilia-
                    tion such as even the highest seraph in heaven would have
                    shrunk from, God Himself must be revealed to humanity. In
                    order to do this, our Saviour clothed His divinity with humanity.
                    He employed the human faculties, for only by adopting these
                    could He be comprehended by humanity. Only humanity could
                    reach humanity. He lived out the character of God through the
                    human body which God had prepared for Him. He blessed the
                    world by living out in human flesh the life of God, thus showing
                    that He had the power to unite humanity to divinity."—Ellen
                    G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 7, p. 924.
                        Both the law and Jesus reveal the righteousness that God
                    designed that man should possess, and both are based on how
                    God Himself relates to the universe. These two revelations of
                    righteousness belong together and must never be separated.
                    "The law and the gospel are so blended that the truth cannot
                    be presented as it is in Jesus, without blending these subjects
                    in perfect agreement. The law is the gospel of Christ veiled;
                    the gospel of Jesus is nothing more or less than the law de-
                    fined, showing its far-reaching principles."—Ellen G. White,
                    Review and Herald, May 27, 1890.
                        The written law provided the divine objective standard by
                    which Jesus lived. If no law preceded Him, how could it be
                    seen by men that He was righteous? The life of Jesus pro-
                     vided the human life in which the law was perfectly displayed.
                    If He had not lived the law how would it be fully known what
                    is the content of a righteous human life?
 THINK IT THROUGH       How can I blend Jesus and the law together in my daily
                    life?
                       In 1890 Ellen G. White wrote: "As a people, we have
                    preached the law until we are as dry as the hills of Gilboa that
                    had neither dew nor rain. We must preach Christ in the law,
                    and ... trust not in our own merits at all."—Ellen G. White, Re-

Righteousness LESSON 1                                                 ❑ Thursday
                                                                         January 3

             Part 5    What does Isaiah state to have been the result of Judah's
      RELATIONSHIP sins?
         WITH GOD      "But your iniquities have separated between you and your
           Isa. 59:2 God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will
                     not hear."
                         Sin, disobedience of the law, separates man from God. Man
                     before sin had an unbroken relationship with God. Every sin
                     is not only a breaking of the law, but also an act of disloyalty
                     to God. (See Selected Messages, Bk. 1, p. 218.) Wrong conduct,
                     judged by the law, not only makes one an unrighteous person
                     for the record, both in heaven's books and in his own body, but
                     it also changes the relationship between man and God. A
                     sinner alone cannot mend his conduct sufficiently to be the kind
                     of person he would have been if he had not sinned, so man
                     cannot come to God on the basis of his corrected conduct. But
                     God through the cross has arranged that the relationship that
                     He originally planned to have with each person can be estab-
                     lished when the sinner has faith in Jesus whose life presents
                     the ideal conduct. This faith in Jesus and His ideal conduct is
                     accepted by God in the place of the faulty conduct of the sinner,
                     and a basis is thus provided for the new relationship between
                     God and the sinner. This ideal conduct of Jesus is Christ's
                     righteousness and the establishment of the relationship is
                     justification.
                         "We have transgressed the law of God, and by the deeds of
                     the law shall no flesh be justified. The best efforts that man in
                     his own strength can make, are valueless to meet the holy and
                     just law that he has transgressed; but through faith in Christ
                     he may claim the righteousness of the Son of God as all-suffi-
                     cient. Christ satisfied the demands of the law in His human
                     nature. He bore the curse of the law for the sinner, made an
                     atonement for him, that whosoever believeth in Him should not
                     perish, but have everlasting life. Genuine faith appropriates the
                     righteousness of Christ, and the sinner is made an overcomer
                     with Christ; for he is made a partaker of the divine nature, and
                     thus divinity and humanity are combined."—Selected Mes-
                     sages, Bk. 1, pp. 363, 364.

 THINK IT THROUGH       What prompts my good conduct—the desire to be well
                     thought of, or the desire to honor God and be loyal to Him?
                         "God's dear Son died that He might impute unto man His
                     own righteousness, and not that he might be at liberty to break
                     God's holy law, as Satan tries to make men believe. Through
                     faith in Christ, man may be in possession of moral power to
                     resist evil."—Selected Messages, Bk. 1, p. 317.

Righteousness       LESSON 1                                             ❑ Friday
                                                                         January 4

          Part 6    What is Paul's command to the person who has been justi-
      CORRECTED fled?
        CONDUCT     "Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrigh-
       Rom. 6:13 teousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those
                 that are alive from the dead, and your members as instru-
                 ments of righteousness unto God."

                         The new relationship with God puts man in a position to
                     receive from God, by the Spirit, power to correct his conduct.
                     It is sin that breaks the ideal relationship between God and
                     man; thus in order to perpetuate the new relationship, the be-
                     liever must renounce sinful conduct and accept as his own
                     ideal the perfect conduct of Jesus. As he seeks to copy the
                     conduct of Jesus, his own conduct is corrected, step by step.
                     This correction of conduct is sanctification. The faith in Jesus
                     by which the new relationship with God was formed serves also
                     as the means of conduct correction. When distinctions are
                     made between justification and sanctification it is not possible
                     to say that the believer is saved by one and not by the other,
                     for the relationship and the conduct are two parts of that which
                     is the ground of our salvation—the righteousness of Jesus
                     Christ. For salvation the relationship and the correction of
                     conduct must move on together—the corrected conduct per-
                     petuating the relationship, and the relationship covering the
                     imperfections of the conduct that exist in spite of one's best
                     efforts. The real key here is that the believer be relating to
                     God in loyalty and good faith, putting forth his best efforts to
                     correct his conduct, and not using the relationship with God
                     to cover up unrepentance.
                         "Christ looks at the spirit, and when He sees us carrying
                     our burden with faith, His perfect holiness atones for our short-
                      comings. When we do our best, He becomes our righteousness.
                     It takes every ray of light that God sends to us to make us the
                     light of the world."—Selected Messages, Bk. 1, p. 368.

 THINK IT THROUGH       How does the righteousness of Jesus become my righteous-
                     ness?

                        "When it is in the heart to obey God, when efforts are put
                     forth to this end, Jesus accepts this disposition and effort as
                     man's best service, and He makes up for the deficiency with
                     His own divine merit. But He will not accept those who claim
                     to have faith in Him, and yet are disloyal to His Father's com-
                     mandment. We hear a great deal about faith, but we need to
                     hear a great deal more about works."—Selected Messages,

                         The prayer of Daniel is a confession of the gins of Israel
                     that had caused their captivity. The prophet recalls that God's
                     acts have been righteous, but he finds no cause for merit or
                     special consideration for his people. On the one side stands
                     God's righteousness; on the other, Israel's prolonged record
                     of sin. Daniel intercedes, saying, "For we do not present our
                     supplications before thee for our righteousnesses, but for thy
                     great mercies." Dan. 9:18. This experience illustrates the re-
                     lation of the whole human family with God.

                         To what did an earlier prophet compare the righteousness
                     of Judah? Isa. 64:6.


                        How many have failed to maintain God's standard of

FIRST THINGS FIRST Jesus?
         Matt. 6:33
        1 Tim. 6:11   "But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteous-
                    ness; and all these things shall be added unto you."

                       "But thou, 0 man of God, flee these things; and follow
                    after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meek-
                    ness."

                        We are to give first place to seeking "the kingdom of God
                    and His righteousness" and do it with all our hearts. Jer.
                    29:12, 13. It is easy to become absorbed in the cares of life
                    and in the acquisition of material things. We must remember
                    "that man doth not live by bread only." Deut. 8:3.
                        "I [Jesus] have come to open to you the kingdom of love
                    and righteousness and peace. Open your hearts to receive this
                    kingdom, and make its service your highest interest. Though
                    it is a spiritual kingdom, fear not that your needs for this life
                    will be uncared-for. If you give yourself to God's service, He
                    who has all power in heaven and earth will provide for your
                    needs."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, page 99.

                       How abundantly did God promise to provide the blessing
                    of righteousness to Israel if they would seek Him? Hosea
                    10:12.

                       What is the Lord's attitude toward those who seek righ-
                    teousness? Prov. 15:9.


 THINK IT THROUGH      What proportion of my time and energy do I give to ma-
                    terial gain, and how much attention do I give to my relation-
                    ship with God?

                        "All who choose Christ's kingdom of love and righteousness
                    and peace, making its interest paramount to all other, are

            Part 3      What is the prerequisite to being filled with righteousness?
 BLESSED ARE THEY
         Matt. 5:6      "Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righ-
                     teousness: for they shall be filled."

                         Just as hunger and thirst arise out of the physical needs
                     of the human beings, so the hunger and thirst after righteous-
                     ness arise out of spiritual needs. But contrary to the case of
                     man's physical hunger, man does not himself produce a spir-
                     itual hunger. It is the Holy Spirit that produces the hunger as
                     well as satisfies it.
                         "He who desires the truth in his heart, who longs for the
                     working of its power upon the life and character, will be sure
                     to have it. Says the Saviour, 'Blessed are they which do hun-
                     ger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.' "
                     —That I May Know Him, page 10.
                         "If you have a sense of need in your soul, if you hunger
                     and thirst after righteousness, this is an evidence that Christ
                     has wrought upon your heart, in order that He may be sought
                     unto to do for you, through the endowment of the Holy Spirit,
                     those things which it is impossible for you to do for yourself.
                     We need not seek to quench our thirst at shallow streams; for
                     the great fountain is just above us, of whose abundant waters
                     we may freely drink, if we will rise a little higher in the path-
                     way of faith."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, page 19.

 THINK IT THROUGH       What is the meaning of hungering and thirsting after righ-
                     teousness?

                        "Not by painful struggles or wearisome toil, not by gift or
                     sacrifice, is righteousness obtained; but it is freely given to
                     every soul who hungers and thirsts to receive it. 'Ho, every one
                     that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no
                     money; come ye, buy, and eat, .. . without money and without
                     price.' ...
                        "No human agent can supply that which will satisfy the
                     hunger and thirst of the soul. But Jesus says, 'Behold, I stand
                     at the door, and knock: if any man hear My voice, and open

         ler. 23:5, 6 safely: and this is his name whereby he shall be called, THE
                     LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS."



                        This passage was written by the prophet following his de-
                     nunciation of Jehoiakim and his son Coniah or Jehoiachin. It
                     was a time of instability in government, for in a period of about
                     three months there were three kings of Judah, and the im-
                     potence of these was demonstrated by Nebuchadnezzar's at-
                     tack on Jerusalem resulting in the death of Jehoiakim, the cap-
                     ture of Jehoiachin, and the enthronement by the Babylonians
                     of Zedekiah. The meaning of the latter's name was "the Lord
                     my righteousness," or "the Lord is righteous." Under these cir-
                     cumstances Jeremiah predicts the coming of the Messiah-King
                     whose name would be THE LORD IS OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS
                     (RSV). This name affirms that in Christ is the righteousness that
                     human beings need and can find in no other source.
                        Yes, the Lord is the source of righteousness, and this righ-
                     teousness is for us. But not all are willing to admit that they
                     stand in need of this righteousness.

                        What name was to be applied to Jerusalem when the
                     Branch had come? Jer. 33:15, 16.




 THINK IT THROUGH        If I were to name my house according to the loyalty of
                     the members of the household, what could I call it? Would
                     it be appropriate to name it "The Lord Is Our Righteousness?"



                        "On the Saviour's coronation day He will not acknowledge
                     as His any who bear spot or wrinkle. But to His faithful ones
                     He will give crowns of immortal glory. Those who would not

                          "Hear me when I call, 0 God of my righteousness."

                           In this and the former lesson a large number of passages
                       from the Old Testament have been brought in. We often hear
                       the testimony of the New Testament on the subject of "Christ,
                       Our Righteousness," and may forget that the Old Testament
                       contains many messages on this vital subject.
                           The 119th Psalm gives eloquent expression to the subject
                       of God's righteousness. Note the following:
                            "Righteous art thou, 0 Lord, and upright are thy judgments."
                       Verse 137.
                            "Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and
                       thy law is the truth." Verse 142.
                            "My tongue shall speak of thy word: for all thy command-
                       ments are righteousness." Verse 172.
                           In the same psalm the writer records his response to his
                       contemplation of God's righteousness:
                            "Behold, I have longed after thy precepts: quicken me in
                       thy righteousness." Verse 40.
                            "Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; for there-
                        in do I delight." Verse 35.
                            "Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things
                        out of thy law." Verse 18.

 THINK IT THROUGH         Are there ways in which my attitudes do not harmonize
                       with the plea "Make me to go in the path of thy command-
                       ments"? Ps. 119:35. How can I make this request a reality?

                          "David, in the beauty and vigor of his young manhood, was
                       preparing to take a high position with the noblest of the earth.
                       His talents, as precious gifts from God, were employed to extol
                       the glory of the divine Giver. His opportunities of contempla-
                       tion and meditation served to enrich him with that wisdom and
                       piety that made him beloved of God and angels. As he con-
                       templated the perfections of his Creator, clearer conceptions
                       of God opened before his soul. Obscure themes were illumi-
                       nated, difficulties were made plain, perplexities were harmo-
                       nized, and each ray of new light called forth fresh bursts of
                       rapture, and sweeter anthems of devotion, to the glory of God
                       and the Redeemer."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 642.

              Part 1      What was Jesus' claim about His identity?
     JESUS WAS GOD
           John 8:58      "Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Be-
                       fore Abraham was, I am."

                          Ellen G. White notes that these words were spoken by Jesus
                       "with solemn dignity," and she then comments:
                          "Silence fell upon the vast assembly. The name of God,
                       given to Moses to express the idea of the eternal presence,
                       had been claimed as His own by this Galilean Rabbi. He had
                       announced Himself to be the self-existent One, He who had
                       been promised to Israel, 'whose goings forth have been from
                       of old, from the days of eternity.' Micah 5:2, margin."—The

                          Could men know by looking at Jesus that He was God?
                       Phil. 2:6, 7.

                          "The faith of men in Christ as the Messiah was not to rest
                       on the evidences of sight, and they believe on Him because of
                       His personal attractions, but because of the excellence of
                       character found in Him, which never had been found, neither
                       could be, in another."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible

                          What was Paul's claim about Jesus' identity? Col. 2:9.

                          "In Christ is gathered all the glory of the Father. In Him
                       is all the fullness of the Godhead bodily. He is the brightness
                       of the Father's glory, and the express image of His person.
                       The glory of the attributes of God are expressed in His char-
                       acter....
                          "We are not to praise the gospel, but praise Christ. We are
                       not to worship the gospel, but the Lord of gospel. Christ is a

 THINK IT THROUGH         How could I recognize that Jesus was God if I were in His
                       earthly presence?

                           "Christ had not ceased to be God when He became man.
                       Though He had humbled Himself to humanity, the Godhead was
                       still His own. Christ alone could represent the Father to hu-
                       manity, and this representation the disciples had been privi-

              Part 2      According to Paul what benefit has come to the believer
           RESULTS     from Christ's Godship?
   Col. 2:9, 10, RSV
                           "For in him the whole fulness of deity dwells bodily, and
                       you have come to fulness of life in him, who is the head of
                       all rule and authority."

                          "What a thought is this! In Christ 'dwelleth all the fulness
                       of the Godhead bodily. And ye are complete in Him.' Never
                       will the human heart know happiness until it is submitted to
                       be molded by the Spirit of God. The Spirit conforms the re-
                       newed soul to the model, Jesus Christ."—Messages to Young
                       People, pages 55, 56.

                          What was one result, which Jesus illustrated by a ladder,
                       of His coming into this world? John 1:51.

                          This illustration is based on the story of Jacob's dream
                       recorded in Genesis 28:10-17. Jesus identified Himself as the
                       ladder. He is the means by which man is brought into contact
                       with divinity. "The top of the ladder, reaching into heaven,
                       represents the divine power of Christ, who grasps the Infinite
                       and thus links earth to heaven and finite man to the infinite
                       God. Through Christ the communication is opened between
                       God and man."—Selected Messages, Bk. 1, p. 280.
                          Because Jesus is God, He is able to bring to man divine
                       power to conquer sin. Without the divine Jesus there would
                       not have been any communication from God to man—no an-
                       gels, no Spirit, no Scriptures—and this world would have had
                       no knowledge of truth to combat Satan's lies about God, and
                       no power to resist his temptations. The information and power
                       that man needs is supplied by his divine Saviour, who is sym-
                       bolized as a ladder from earth to heaven.

                          What happens in the life of one who by faith is righteous?
                       2 Peter 1:1-4.

                          "There was in Him nothing that responded to Satan's sophis-
                       try. He did not consent to sin. Not even by a thought did He
                       yield to temptation. So it may be with us. Christ's humanity
                       was united with divinity; He was fitted for the conflict by the
                       indwelling of the Holy Spirit. And He came to make us partak-
                       ers of the divine nature."—The Desire of Ages, page 123.

                       came into this world to make available to men?

                Part 3      What word does Paul use to describe the completeness
     JESUS WAS MAN       with which Jesus gave up the form and position of God?
      Phil. 2:5-1, RSV
                            "Have this mind among yourselves, which you have in
                         Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not
                         count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied
                         himself, taking the form of a servant, being born in the like-
                         ness of men."

                            "When we want a deep problem to study, let us fix our
                         minds on the most marvelous thing that ever took place in
                         earth or heaven—the incarnation of the Son of God. . . .
                            "The whole world was His, but so completely did He empty
                         Himself that during His ministry He declared, "Foxes have
                         holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man
                         hath not where to lay his head.' [Heb. 2:14-18 quoted.]"—Ellen

                            "Christ did not make-believe take human nature; He did
                         verily take it. He did in reality possess human nature. 'As the
                         children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself
                         likewise took part of the same.' He was the Son of Mary; He
                         was of the seed of David according to human descent. He is

                             "It would have been an almost infinite humiliation for the
                         Son of God to take man's nature, even when Adam stood in
                         his innocence in Eden. But Jesus accepted humanity when the
                         race had been weakened by four thousand years of sin. Like
                         every child of Adam He accepted the results of the working
                         of the great law of heredity....

The Righteous Jesus      LESSON 3                                  ❑   Wednesday
                                                                       January 16

          Part 4      What reason is given in Hebrews 2:17 for Jesus becoming
         MUTUAL     human?
  UNDERSTANDING        "Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like
        Heb. 2:17   unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful
                    high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation
                    for the sins of the people."

                        "In Christ were united the divine and the human—the Crea-
                    tor and the creature. The nature of God, whose law had been
                    transgressed, and the nature of Adam, the transgressor, meet
                    in Jesus—the Son of God, and the Son of man. And having
                    with His own blood paid the price of redemption, having
                    passed through man's experience, having in man's behalf met
                    and conquered temptation, having, though Himself sinless
                    borne the shame and guilt and burden of sin, He becomes
                    man's Advocate and Intercessor. What an assurance here to
                    the tempted and struggling soul, what an assurance to the
                    witnessing universe, that Christ will be 'a merciful and faithful
                    high priest'!"—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Com-
                    mentary, Vol. 7, p. 926.
                        "For our sake Jesus emptied Himself of His glory; He
                    clothed His divinity with humanity that he might touch human-
                    ity, that His personal presence might be among us, that we
                    might know that He was acquainted with all our trials, and
                    sympathized with our grief, that every son and daughter of
                    Adam might understand that Jesus is the friend of sinners."
                    —Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 7,
                    p. 927.
                        It is not that God could not understand man's situation, but
                    there needed to be a way by which man was assured that God
                    understood. Jesus by His human experience provides the
                    ground for man's faith in a God who understands man's needs.
                       What result of Jesus' humanity is inferred in John 14:9?

 THINK IT THROUGH      Was there anything about human life that Jesus did not
                    understand before He became a man? Why did He become
                    a man?
                       "He came in humility, in order that the humblest being
                    upon the face of the earth could have no excuse because of
                    his poverty, or ignorance, and say, Because of these things, I
                    cannot obey the law of Jehovah. Christ clothed His divinity
                    with humanity, that humanity might touch humanity. . . . In His
                    humanity He understood all the temptations that will come to
                    man."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary,

             Part 5     In what way was Jesus' experience with temptation the
         JESUS WAS    same as ours? How was it different?
           TEMPTED       "For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched
          Heb. 4:15   with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points
                      tempted like as we are, yet without sin."

                          "Christ bore the sins and infirmities of the race as they
                      existed when He came to the earth to help man. In behalf of
                      the race, with the weaknesses of fallen man upon Him, He was
                      to stand the temptations of Satan upon all points wherewith
                      man would be assailed."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA

                          "The temptations to which Christ was subjected were a ter-
                      rible reality. As a free agent, He was placed on probation, with
                      liberty to yield to Satan's temptations and work at cross-pur-
                      poses with God. If this were not so, if it had not been possible
                      for Him to fall, He could not have been tempted in all points

                      Christ or himself should be conqueror. . . . You can never be
                      tempted in so determined and cruel a manner as was our

 THINK IT THROUGH        In what way can it be said that Jesus was tempted in all
                      points as we are, when many attractions of the world did
                      not exist in His earthly lifetime?

                         "If He [Jesus] did not have man's nature, He could not be
                      our example. If He was not a partaker of our nature, He could
                      not have been tempted as man has been. If it were not possible
                      for Him to yield to temptation, He could not be our helper. It
                      was a solemn reality that Christ came to fight the battles as

                      took humanity, with all its liabilities. He took the nature of
                      man, with the possibility of yielding to temptation. We have

                                                                         January 18

          Part 6       What was proved by Jesus' sinless life?
MAN NEED NOT SIN
        Rom. 8:3       "For what the law could not do, in that it was weak
                    through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness
                    of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh."

                       "Christ came to the earth, taking humanity and standing
                    as man's representative, to show in the controversy with Satan
                    that man, as God created him, connected with the Father and
                    the Son, could obey every divine requirement."—Ellen G. White
                    Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 7, p. 926.
                       "The Saviour's life of obedience maintained the claims of
                    the law; it proved that the law could be kept in humanity, and
                    showed the excellence of character that obedience would de-
                    velop."—The Desire of Ages, page 309.

                       What outstanding feature of Christ's life is to be a source
                    of encouragement to man? John 16:33.

                       As Jesus has overcome the world, so we, in the power of
                    the Spirit made available by virtue of Christ's victory, can over-
                    come the world. Satan has at least one more accusation that
                    he can make against Jesus. It is that Christ's experience in
                    overcoming all temptation successfully was , a unique experi-
                    ence that cannot be duplicated by ordinary believers. But the
                    message of Jesus to us is that what He did, we also can do.
                       "To every one who surrenders fully to God is given the priv-
                    ilege of living without sin, in obedience to the law of heaven."
                    —Ellen G. White, Review and Herald, Sept. 27, 1906.
                       "Exact obedience is required, and those who say that it is
                    not possible to live a perfect life throw upon God the imputa-
                    tion of injustice and untruth."—Ellen G. White, Review and
                    Herald, Feb. 7, 1957.
                       Through believers who trust fully in Jesus to give them vic-
                    tory over all sin Jesus will answer Satan's last lying charge.
 THINK IT THROUGH      Can hereditary weaknesses be overcome in this life?

                       "Those who put their trust in Christ are not to be enslaved
                    by any hereditary or cultivated habit or tendency. Instead of
                    being held in bondage to the lower nature, they are to rule
                    every appetite and passion. God has not left us to battle with
                    evil in our own finite strength. Whatever may be our inherited
                    or cultivated tendencies to wrong, we can overcome through
                    the power that He is ready to impart."—The Ministry of Heal-

    SIN'S RESULTS     is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be."
Rom. 8:1; lames 4:4       "Know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity
                      with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world
                      is the enemy of God."
                          What is the meaning in James 4:4 of the expression "a
                      friend of the world"?
                         When Adam and Eve sinned, they turned their backs upon
                      God. They had been deceived into thinking that God did not
                      have their best interests at heart.
                          The basic question that Adam and Eve faced when tempted
                      was "Whom shall we believe?" God had given them evidence
                      in the provision for their life and happiness that He was con-
                      cerned for their welfare. Satan presented only words and the
                      spectacle of a talking serpent. But Satan's words aroused the
                      couple's interest in themselves, and it became pleasant to
                      believe the serpent and restrictive to believe God. When they
                      believed the serpent's words, they placed themselves in op-
                      position to God's words and became God's enemies.

                        What are the results of sin in the relationship between
                      man and God? Isa. 59:2.
                         "Adam, in his innocence, had enjoyed open communion with
                      his Maker; but sin brought separation between God and man,
                      and the atonement of Christ alone could span the abyss and
                      make possible the communication of blessing or salvation from
                      heaven to earth."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 67.

 THINK IT THROUGH        What is the danger of regarding God's rules as only restric-
                      tions? How should I regard God's law?
                          "But divine love had conceived a plan whereby man might
                      be redeemed. The broken law of God demanded the life of the
                      sinner. In all the universe there was but one who could, in
                      behalf of man, satisfy its claims. Since the divine law is as
                      sacred as God Himself, only one equal with God could make
                      atonement for its transgression. None but Christ could redeem
                      fallen man from the curse of the law and bring him again into
                      harmony with Heaven. Christ would take upon Himself the
                      guilt and shame of sin—sin so offensive to a holy God that it
                      must separate the Father and His Son. Christ would reach to
                      the depths of misery to rescue the ruined race."—Pafriarchs

               Part 2     In the doctrine of reconciliation who is reconciled to
     RECONCILIATION     whom?
     2 Cor. 5:19, RSV
                           "God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not
                        counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting to us
                        the message of reconciliation."

                           God has never been man's enemy. His opposition is against
                        sin, not people. Since the fall, man has consistently been at
                        enmity with God, and God's offer of reconciliation is really His
                        recognition that man can be separated from sin, and thus no
                        longer at enmity with God.
                           Man's sin, from which he can be separated, was the result
                        of believing a misrepresentation of God's attitude toward His
                        creatures. Could man be shown the correct view of God's char-
                        acter, and believe it, then a restoration of friendship between
                        man and God would be possible. Christ came to earth to reveal
                        to man God's love for him, and to provide evidence, by His
                        own self-sacrifice, on which man could base his belief in the
                        kind of God Jesus revealed.
                           "Reconciliation means that every barrier between the soul
                        and God is removed, and that the sinner realizes what the
                        pardoning love of God means. By reason of the sacrifice made
                        by Christ for fallen men, God can justly pardon the transgres-
                        sor who accepts the merits of Christ. Christ was the channel
                        through which the mercy, love, and righteousness might flow
                        from the heart of God to the heart of the sinner."—Selected

                           By what event is man reconciled to God? Rom. 5:10;
                        1 Peter 3:18.


 THINK IT THROUGH          If I believe that God is my friend what effect will this

                            "Through Christ, restoration as well as reconciliation is pro-
                        vided for man. The gulf that was made by sin has been spanned
                        by the cross of Calvary. A full, complete ransom has been
                        paid by Jesus, by virtue of which the sinner is pardoned, and
                        the justice of the law is maintained. All who believe that Christ

            Part 3    What two facets of God's character are implied in John
  MISREPRESENTA- 3:17?
  TION CORRECTED      "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begot-
      John 3:16,11 ten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish,
                    but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the
                    world to condemn the world; but that the world through him
                    might be saved."
                        The cross demonstrates that God is merciful to man, be-
                    cause a member of the Godhead became a man and willingly
                    died in the process of showing man what God is like. On the
                    other hand the cross demonstrates God's judgment on sin
                    because the Father separated Himself from Jesus, as though
                    Jesus were a sinner, refusing to change the law even to save
                    the Son.
                        "The death of Christ on the cross of Calvary is our only
                    hope in this world, and it will be our theme in the world to
                    come. Oh, we do not comprehend the value of the atonement!
                    . . . The gift of God in His beloved Son was the expression of
                    an incomprehensible love. It was the utmost that God could
                    do to preserve the honor of His law, and still save the trans-
                    gressor. Why should man not study the theme of redemption?
                    It is the greatest subject that can engage the human mind."
                    —Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 5,
                    p. 1132.

 THINK IT THROUGH      How often do my thoughts turn to the great sacrifice that
                    has been made for my redemption? It is "the expression of
                    an incomprehensible love."
                        "By His life and His death, Christ has achieved even more
                    than recovery from the ruin wrought through sin. It was Satan's
                    purpose to bring about an eternal separation between God and
                    man; but in Christ we become more closely united to God than
                    if we had never fallen. In taking our nature, the Saviour has
                    bound Himself to humanity by a tie that is never to be broken.
                    Through the eternal ages He is linked with us. 'God so loved
                    the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son.' John 3:16. He
                    gave Him not only to bear our sins, and to die as our sacrifice;
                    He gave Him to the fallen race. To assure us of His immutable
                    counsel of peace, God gave His only-begotten Son to become
                    one of the human family, forever to retain His human nature.
                    This is the pledge that God will fulfill His word. . . . In Christ
                    the family of earth and the family of heaven are bound to-
                    gether. Christ glorified is our brother. Heaven is enshrined in
                    humanity, and humanity is enfolded in the bosom of Infinite
                    Love."—The Desire of Ages, pages 25, 26.

              Part 4      What thought do the following texts have in common?
        ATTRACTION
     Hosea 11:4, RSV
                          "I led them with cords of compassion, with the bands of
      John 12:32, 33   love, and I became to them as one who eases the yoke on
                       their jaws, and I bent down to them and fed them."


                          "And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men
                       unto me. This he said, signifying what death he should die."

                          These texts speak only of the divine action in drawing men
                       and not of men's response. Through the atonement there has
                       been provided in this world a universal attraction to Jesus. This
                       attraction is not necessarily to the Man Jesus of Nazareth (see
                       The Desire of Ages, page 638) but always to the principles by
                       which He lived, and by the Spirit which He has sent in His
                       place.
                          While the attraction is universal, the response is only from
                       a "little flock."
                          "Christ came to manifest the love of God to the world, to
                       draw the hearts of all men to Himself. He said, 'And I, if I
                       be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me' (John
                       12:32). . . . By the manifestation of His love, by the entreating
                       of His Spirit, He woos men to repentance. . . . It is that men
                       may understand the joy of forgiveness, the peace of God, that
                       Christ draws them through the manifestation of His love. If
                       they respond to His drawing, yielding their hearts to His grace,
                       He will lead them on step by step, to a full knowledge of Him-
                       self, and this is life eternal."—Selected Messages, Bk. 1, pp.
                       323, 324.
                          "In the cross all influence centers, and from it all influence
                       goes forth. It is the great center of attraction; for on it Christ
                       gave up His life for the human race. This sacrifice was offered
                       for the purpose of restoring man to his original perfection. Yea,
                       more, it was offered to give him an entire transformation of
                       character, making him more than a conqueror."Ellen G.
                       White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 6, p. 1113.

 THINK IT THROUGH        When men look to the cross, what is it that draws them
                       away from a life of sin? Have I responded to that drawing
                       power?

                          "As the student of the Bible beholds the Redeemer, there
                       is awakened in the soul the mysterious power of faith, adora-
                       tion, and love."—Education, page 192.

The Purpose of the Cross        LESSON 4                              ❑ Thursday
                                                                       January 24

           Part 5       In the following verse, what two elements does Paul state
   TRANSFORMING      are the means of change in the human heart?
          POWER
                        "But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the
       2 Cor. 3:18
                     glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from
                     glory to glory even as by the Spirit of the Lord."

                       • "By beholding we are to become changed; and as we medi-
                     tate upon the perfections of the divine Model, we shall desire
                     to become wholly transformed, and renewed in the image of
                     His purity. It is by faith in the Son of God that transformation
                     takes place in the character, and the child of wrath becomes
                     the child of God. He passes from death unto life, he becomes
                     spiritual and discerns spiritual things. The wisdom of God en-
                     lightens his mind, and he beholds wondrous things out of His
                     law. As a man is converted by the truth, the work of transfor-
                     mation of charatcer goes on. He has an increased measure of
                     understanding. In becoming a man of obedience to God, he
                     has the mind of Christ, and the will of God becomes His will."
                     —Selected Messages, Bk. 1, p. 338.

                       What outstanding example is given us of the transforming
                     power of Christ? Acts 9:1-6.

                        "In that hour of heavenly illumination Saul's mind acted
                     with remarkable rapidity. The prophetic records of Holy Writ
                     were opened to his understanding. He saw that the rejection
                     of Jesus by the Jews, His crucifixion, resurrection, and ascen-
                     sion, had been foretold by the prophets and proved Him to be
                     the promised Messiah. Stephen's sermon at the time of his
                     martyrdom was brought forcibly to Saul's mind, and he realized
                     that the martyr had indeed beheld 'the glory of God' when he
                     said, 'Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man
                     standing on the right hand of God.' Acts 7:55, 56. The priests
                     had pronounced these words blasphemy, but Saul now knew
                     them to be truth.
                        "What a revelation was all this to the persecutor! Now Saul
                     knew for a certainty that the promised Messiah had come to
                     this earth as Jesus of Nazareth and that He had been rejected
                     and crucified by those whom He came to save."—The Acts of
                     the Apostles, pages 115, 116.

 THINK IT THROUGH       How can I view the crucified One? Am I beholding Him
                     sufficiently to know what He is like and to grow more like
                     Him?

                     that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out."

                         "The first step toward salvation is to respond to the drawing
                     of the love of Christ. God sends message after message to men,
                     entreating them to repentance, that He may forgive, and write
                     pardon against their names."—Selected Messages, Bk. 1, p.

                         What attitude of God expressed to Judah is always His
                     attitude toward the sinner? Ezek. 33:11.

                        "The very first step to Christ is taken through the drawing
                     of the Spirit of God; as man responds to this drawing, he ad-
                     vances toward Christ in order that he may repent. . . .

                     which taketh away the sins of the world. We cannot take a
                     step toward spiritual life save as Jesus draws and strengthens

              Part 1      In writing to Timothy, what place did Paul give to the
         SOURCE OF     Scriptures in relation to salvation?
         SALVATION        "And that from a child thou host known the holy scrip-
         2 Tim. 3:15   tures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation
                       through faith which is in Christ Jesus."

                          How vital is a knowledge of Christ? John 17:3.

                            "We should not take the testimony of any man as to what
                       the Scriptures teach, but should study the words of God for
                       ourselves. If we allow others to do our thinking, we shall have
                       crippled energies and contracted abilities. The noble powers
                       of the mind may be so dwarfed by lack of exercise on themes
                       worthy of their concentration as to lose their ability to grasp
                       the deep meaning of the word of God. The mind will enlarge
                       if it is employed in tracing out the relation of the subjects of
                       the Bible, comparing scripture with scripture and spiritual
                       things with spiritual."—Steps to Christ, pages 89, 90.

                       are centered. John 5:39. Yes, the whole Bible tells of Christ.

                                                                        January 28

          Part 2       What follows after repentance and conversion?
 REPENTANCE AND
     CONVERSION        "Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins
                    may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come
       Acts 3:19
                    from the presence of the Lord."

                       Why is repentance imperative? Acts 17:30, 31.

                      What two kinds of repentance does Paul write of to the
                    Corinthians and in what way do they differ? 2 Cor. 7:10.

                        Repentance is "the first step toward obedience"—Ellen G.
                    White, Signs of the Times, Aug. 13, 1894. The repentant person
                    has turned his back on his old disobedient way of life and
                    has committed himself to live a life of obedience to the Lord.
                        "Repentance includes sorrow for sin and a turning away
                    from it. We shall not renounce sin unless we see its sinfulness;
                    until we turn away from it in heart, there will be no real change
                    in the life."—Steps to Christ, page 23.
                        "The Bible does not teach that the sinner must repent be-
                    fore he can heed the invitation of Christ, 'Come unto Me, all
                    ye that labor and are heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.'
                    Matthew 11:28. It is the virtue that goes forth from Christ, that
                    leads to genuine repentance. Peter made the matter clear in
                    his statement to the Israelites when he said, 'Him hath God
                    exalted with His right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for
                    to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.' Acts
                    5:31. We can no more repent without the Spirit of Christ to
                    awaken the conscience than we can be pardoned without
                    Christ."—Steps to Christ, page 26.

 THINK IT THROUGH      What does the apostle Paul mean when he speaks of cruci-
                    fying the "old man"? (Gal. 2:20). What part does it have in
                    conversion?

                       "What you need to understand is the true force of the will.
                    This is the governing power in the nature of man, the power of
                    decision, or of choice. Everything depends on the right action
                    of the will. The power of choice God has given to men; it is
                    theirs to exercise. You cannot change your heart, you cannot
                    of yourself give to God its affections; but you can choose to
                    serve Him. You can give Him your will; He will then work in
                    you to will and to do according to His good pleasure."—Steps

              Part 3       On what condition does God promise forgiveness to the
        CONFESSION      sinner?
        1 John 1:8, 9
                           "If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and
                        the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and
                        just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrigh-
                        teousness."

                            Confession is not a virtuous act in itself, as one may confess
                        for the wrong reason. "Confession will not be acceptable to
                        God without sincere repentance and reformation."—Testimo-
                        nies, Vol. 5, p. 640. Confession is really a part of repentance.
                        It is the admission of guilt, and repentance is the rejection of
                        the act of which one is guilty.

                           What are the conditions for receiving God's mercy? Prov.
                        28:13.

                            What was God's response to David's confession? Ps. 32:5
                        (last part).

                           "True confession is always of a specific character, and ac-
                        knowledges particular sins. They may be of such a nature as
                        to be brought before God only; they may be wiongs that should
                        be confessed to individuals who have suffered injury through
                        them; or they may be of a public character, and should then
                        be as publicly confessed. But all confession should be definite
                        and to the point, acknowledging the very sins of which you
                        are guilty."—Steps to Christ, page 38.

 THINK IT THROUGH         It will help my brother to confess his faults if I can take
                        some of the blame to myself.

                           "How mistaken are those who imagine that confession of sin
                        will detract from their dignity, and lessen their influence among
                        their fellow men. Clinging to this erroneous idea, though seeing
                        their faults, many fail to confess them, but rather pass by the
                        wrongs they have done others, so embittering their own lives,
                        and shadowing the lives of others. It will not hurt your dignity
                        to confess your sins. Away with this false dignity. Fall on the
                        Rock and be broken, and Christ will give you the true and
                        heavenly dignity. Let not pride, self-esteem, or self-righteous-
                        ness keep anyone from confessing his sin."—Selected Mes-

Accepting God's Provision LESSON 5                                  ❑ Wednesday
                                                                       January 30

           Part 4      What two virtues did Jesus place side by side?
           FAITH
                      "And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of
        Mark 1:15
                    God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel."

                        Repentance alone cannot bring salvation, since repentance
                    is realigning one's life with the law, and the law cannot save.
                    Combined with repentance there must be belief—faith in the
                    Lord Jesus Christ. But faith in Jesus cannot take the place of
                    repentance. Salvation is granted to the sinner as he both re-
                    pents of breaking the law and exercises faith in Jesus. The
                    two must never be separated. They belong together.
                        One of the great promises of the Bible is found in 1 John
                    1:9: "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive
                    us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness." But
                    after having made sincere confession of our sins, how can
                     we be sure that God will keep His promise? We hear no proc-
                    lamation from heaven; we do not see the angels write for-
                    giveness on the heavenly records. It is faith that makes it sure.
                    God has promised, and when we meet the condition, God is
                    faithful. He can be trusted.
                        Satan "had tempted the woman [Eve] to distrust God's love,
                     to doubt His wisdom, and to transgress His law."—Patriarchs
                    and Prophets, page 57. At the cross evidence was given to the
                     world sufficient to remove all doubt and distrust of God's love.
                        "He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for
                     us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?"
                    Romans 8:32.

 THINK IT THROUGH      Do I trust the word of people who are interested in my
                    welfare and who have made sacrifices that I might get ahead?
                    What lesson can I learn from this that will strengthen my trust
                    in my heavenly Father and in His Word?

                        "You have confessed your sins, and in heart put them away.
                    You have resolved to give yourself to God. Now go to Him, and
                    ask that He will wash away your sins and give you a new heart.
                    Then believe that He does this because He has promised. This
                    is the lesson which Jesus taught while He was on earth, that
                    the gift which God promises us, we must believe we do re-
                    ceive, and it is ours."—Steps to Christ, pages 49, 50.
                        "You cannot atone for your past sins; you cannot change
                    your heart and make yourself holy. But God promises to do all
                    this for you through Christ. You believe that promise. You
                    confess your sins and give yourself to God. You will to serve
                    Him. Just as surely as you do this, God will fulfill His word
                    to you."—Steps to Christ, page 51.

             Part 5   What besides future obedience does God require of the
       RESTITUTION converted person?
        Ezek. 33:15
                        "If the wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had
                     robbed, walk in the statutes of life, without committing iniq-
                     uity; he shall surely live, he shall not die."

                        "If we have injured others through any unjust business
                     transaction, if we have overreached in trade, or defrauded any
                     man, even though it be within the pale of the law, we should
                     confess our wrong, and make restitution as far as lies in our
                     power. It is right for us to restore not only that which we have
                     taken, but all that it would have accumulated if put to a right
                     and wise use during the time it has been in our possession."

                        What provision was made in ancient Israel for restitution
                     to a person one had wronged? Num. 5:6, 7.

                     to his fraud? Luke 19:8, 9.

                        "You cannot make every case right, for some whom you
                     have injured have gone into their graves, and the account
                     stands registered against you. In these cases the best you can
                     do is to bring a trespass offering to the altar of the Lord, and

            Part 6   On the day of Pentecost what did Peter indicate was to
         BAPTISM follow repentance?
     Acts 2:31, 38
                        "Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their
                    heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men
                    and brethren, what shall we do? Then Peter said unto them,
                    Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of
                    Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the

                       "Christ has made baptism the sign of entrance to His spir-

                    Baptism is a most solemn renunciation of the world. Self is by
                    profession dead to a life of sin. The waters cover the candi-

                    mutual pledge is made. In the name of the Father, the Son, and
                    the Holy Spirit, man is laid in his watery grave, buried with
                    Christ in baptism, and raised from the water to live the new
                    life of loyalty to God. The three great powers in heaven are

 THINK IT THROUGH      What is accomplished by baptism?

                       "Baptism is a most solemn renunciation of the world. Those
                    who are baptized in the threefold name of the Father, the Son,
                    and the Holy Spirit, at the very entrance of their Christian life
                    declare publicly that they have forsaken the service of Satan
                    and have become members of the royal family, children of the
                    heavenly King. They have obeyed the command: 'Come out
                    from among them, and be ye separate, . . . and touch not the

Paghteousness      "Even as David also de-
                scribeth the blessedness of the
                man, unto whom God im-
                puteth righteousness without
                works, saying, Blessed are
                they whose iniquities are for-
                given, and whose sins are
                covered. Blessed is the man
                to whom the Lord will not im-
                pute sin." Rom. 4:6-8.
                   In the plan of redemption it
                was decided that Christ would
                take upon Himself man's sin
                and suffer the penalty that
                would otherwise fall upon the
                sinner. Thus God "might be
                just, and the justifier of him
                which believeth in Jesus."
                   When the Father accepts
                Christ's righteous life in place
                of man's life of sin, man stands
                justified—his sins are forgiven;
                he is counted as though he
                had never sinned.
                  The same power that has
                drawn the sinner to Christ in
                repentance and faith trans-
                forms his life and makes him
                a loyal and obedient child of
                God.

           Part 1        Read Rom. 4:6-8.
       DEFINITION       In the above passage the apostle Paul wrote of those to
                     whom God "imputeth righteousness" and equated this with
        Rom. 4:6-8
                     the phrase "iniquities are forgiven." The Revised Standard
                     Version uses the expression "reckons righteousness" for
                     "imputeth righteousness."
                         Counted. Gr. logizomai. The same word is translated 'reck-
                     oned' (v. 4) and 'imputeth' (v. 6). In classical Greek and in the
                     papyri the term was used in connection with the keeping of
                     accounts. Abraham's faith was set down on the credit side for
                     righteousness."—SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 6, p. 512.
                         "Be justified. Gr. dikaioo, 'to set right,' to regard as righ-
                     teous,' to declare righteous,' to treat as being righteous,' to
                     present as righteous.' The word occurs 39 times in the NT, 27
                     of these being in the writings of Paul. The significance of
                     dikaioo is somewhat obscured by the translation `to justify.'
                     In the Greek dikaioo, `to justify,' dikaios, 'righteous,' dikaio-
                     sune, 'righteousness,' are all built on the same root and the
                     relationship between the three is clearly seen."—SDA Bible
                     Commentary, Vol. 6, p. 500.
                         "Justification is a full, complete pardon of sin. The moment
                     a sinner accepts Christ by faith, that moment he is pardoned.
                     The righteousness of Christ is imputed to him, and he is no
                     more to doubt God's forgiving grace."—Ellen G. White Com-
                     ments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 6, p. 1071.

 THINK IT THROUGH       A little girl once came to Mrs. White speaking for a group
                     of children. She said, "Will you please ask the minister to
                     speak easy words that we can understand? . . . We do not
                     understand large words, like 'justification.' . . . We do not
                     know what these words mean."—"Counsels to Teachers," page
                     254. How would I explain "justification" to children?
                        "Pardon and justification are one and the same thing.
                     Through faith, the believer passes from the position of a rebel,
                     a child of sin and Satan, to the position of a loyal subject of
                     Christ Jesus, not because of an inherent goodness, but be-
                     cause Christ receives him as His child by adoption. The sinner
                     receives the forgiveness of his sins, because these sins are
                     borne by his Substitute and Surety. The Lord speaks to His
                     heavenly Father, saying: 'This is My child. I reprieve him from
                     the condemnation of death, giving him My life insurance policy
                     —eternal life—because I have taken his place and have suf-
                     fered for his sins. He is even My beloved son.' Thus man,
                     pardoned, and clothed with the beautiful garments of Christ's
                     righteousness, stands faultless before God."—Ellen G. White

             Part 2       What has made justification possible? Rom. 5:8, 9.
           SOURCE
         Rom. 5:8, 9       "I would call on all who would win heaven, to take warning.
                       Do not devote your precious probationary time to sewing to-
                       gether fig leaves to cover the nakedness which is the result
                       of sin. As you look into the Lord's great moral looking glass,
                       His holy law, His standard of character, do not for a moment
                       suppose that it can cleanse you. There are no saving proper-
                       ties in the law. It cannot pardon the transgressor. The penalty
                       must be exacted. The Lord does not save sinners by abolish-
                       ing His law, the foundation of His government in heaven and
                       in earth. The punishment has been endured by the sinner's
                       substitute. Not that God is cruel and merciless, and Christ so
                       merciful that He died on Calvary's cross to abolish a law so
                       arbitrary that it needed to be extinguished, crucified between
                       two thieves. The throne of God must not bear one stain of
                       crime, one taint of sin. In the councils of heaven, before the
                       world was created, the Father and the Son covenanted together
                       that if man proved disloyal to God, Christ, one with the Father,
                       would take the place of the transgressor, and suffer the penalty
                       of justice that must fall upon him."—Ellen G. White Comments,

                         What elements of vicarious sacrifice are taught in Isaiah
                       53? How does this relate to justification? Isa. 53:5, 6.

                          What does the Passover teach about justification? Ex. 12:7,
                       12, 13.

 THINK IT THROUGH        How can I apply the blood of Christ to the doorposts of
                       my heart?

                           "The Passover was to be both commemorative and typical,
                       not only pointing back to the deliverance from Egypt, but
                       forward to the greater deliverance which Christ was to accom-
                       plish in freeing His people from the bondage of sin. The sacri-
                       ficial lamb represents 'the Lamb of God,' in whom is our only
                       hope of salvation. Says the apostle, 'Christ our Passover is
                       sacrificed for us.' 1 Corinthians 5:7. It was not enough that the
                       paschal lamb be slain; its blood must be sprinkled upon the
                       doorposts; so the merits of Christ's blood must be applied to
                       the soul. We must believe, not only that He died for the world,
                       but that He died for us individually. We must appropriate to
                       ourselves the virtue of the atoning sacrifice."—Patriarchs and

             Part 3      On what condition does God justify the sinner? By what
             MEANS    can one not be justified?
     Gal. 2:16, RSV      "Yet [we] who know that a man is not justified by works
                      of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, even we have
                      believed in Christ Jesus, in order to be justified by faith in
                      Christ, and not by works of the law, because by works of the
                      law shall no one be justified."

                          When Paul places emphasis on God's part in making justi-
                      fication possible he uses such expressions as "being justified
                      freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ
                      Jesus" (Rom. 3:24), and "justified by his blood" (Rom. 5:9),
                      or "the gift of righteousness" (Rom. 5:17).
                          When Paul shows what man must do to appropriate the
                      provision that has been made for him through Christ's sacrifice,
                      he uses such expressions as "justified by faith" (Rom. 3:28;
                      Rom. 5:1), and "his faith is counted for righteousness" (Rom.
                      4:5).
                          "The sinner must come in faith to Christ, take hold of His
                      merits, lay his sins upon the Sin Bearer, and receive His par-
                      don. It was for this cause that Christ came into the world. Thus
                      the ri.-.-Thteousness of Christ is imputed to the repenting, believ-
                      ing sinner. He becomes a member of the royal family, a child
                      of the heavenly King, an heir of God, and joint heir with Christ."
                      —Selected Messages, Bk. 1, p. 215.
                          "Let no one take the limited, narrow position that any of the
                      works of man can help in the least possible way to liquidate
                      the debt of his transgression. This is a fatal deception. If you
                      would understand it, you must cease haggling over your pet
                      ideas, and with humble hearts survey the atonement.
                          "This matter is so dimly comprehended that thousands
                      upon thousands claiming to be sons of God are children of
                      the wicked one, because they will depend on their own works.
                      God always demanded good works, the law demands it, but
                       because man placed himself in sin where his good works were
                       valueless, Jesus' righteousness alone can avail. . . .
                          "All that man can possibly do toward his own salvation is
                       to accept the invitation, 'Whosoever will, let him take the water
                       of life freely.' No sin can be committed by man for which satis-
                      .:• tion has not been met on Calvary. Thus the cross, in earnest
                      appeals, continually proffers to the sinner a thorough expia-

              Part 4       "Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin
          RESULTS I    is covered. Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth
                       not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile."
         Ps. 32:1, 2
         Ps. 103:1.3       "Bless the Lord, 0 my soul: and all that is within me, bless
                       his holy name. Bless the Lord, 0 my soul, and forget not all
                       his benefits: who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth
                       all thy diseases."
                          David had sinned, but God had forgiven him, and this
                       brought great joy to David. David closes Psalm 32, with a call
                       to rejoicing. "Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, ye righteous:
                       and shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart."
                           How does the Bible illustrate the reality of the forgiveness
                       of sin? Ps. 103:12; Micah 7:19.
                         When an individual asks for forgiveness of sins, what
                       should be his attitude toward others? Matt. 6:12. See also
                       Eph. 4:32.
                           "God in Christ gave Himself for our sins. He suffered the
                       cruel death of the cross, bore for us the burden of guilt, 'the
                       just for the unjust,' that He might reveal to us His love and
                       draw us to Himself. And He says, 'Be ye kind one to another,
                       tenderhearted, forgiving each other, even as God also in
                       Christ forgave you.' Ephesians 4:32, RV. Let Christ, the divine
                       Life, dwell in you and through you reveal the heaven-born love
                       that will inspire hope in the hopeless and bring heaven's peace
                       to the sin-stricken heart. As we come to God, this is the con-
                       dition which meets us at the threshold, that, receiving mercy
                       from Him, we yield ourselves to reveal His grace to others."—
                       Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, pages 114, 115.

 THINK IT THROUGH         How is one assured that God has forgiven him?
                          "But forgiveness has a broader meaning than many suppose.
                       When God gives the promise that He 'will abundantly pardon,'
                       He adds, as if the meaning of that promise exceeded all that
                       we could comprehend: 'My thoughts are not your thoughts,
                       neither are your ways My ways, saith the Lord. For as the
                       heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than
                       your ways, and My thoughts than your thoughts.' Isaiah 55:7-9.
                       God's forgiveness is not merely a judicial act by which He sets
                       us free from condemnation. It is not only forgiveness for sin,
                       but reclaiming from sin. It is the outflow of redeeming love that
                       transforms the heart."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing,

                                                                        February 7

           Part 5      What does Paul state is the result of justification?
       RESULTS II
         Rom. 5:1     "Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with
                    God through our Lord Jesus Christ."

                        In the paragraph of Rom. 5:1-5 the apostle Paul wrote of
                    several results of justification. (1) "We have peace with God,"
                    v. 1; (2) "we rejoice in hope of the glory of God," v. 2; and
                    (3) "we glory in tribulations," v. 3. In the SDA Bible Commen-
                    tary on these verses it is pointed out that the reading that best
                    reflects the thought of the Greek and the context in the first
                    two instances is "let us go on having peace," and "let us go
                    on rejoicing." This rejoicing is in both hope and trouble. Paul
                    closes by stating that the hope of the justified believer is a
                    real hope because the believer has received the Holy Spirit.
                    Peace, rejoicing in hope and tribulation, and receiving the
                    Spirit are results of justification.
                         "Paul's association of peace with justification by faith makes
                     it still clearer that justification is no mere adjustment of a
                     sinner's legal status with God. . . . Forgiveness alone does
                     not necessarily bring peace. The man who has been pardoned
                     for some crime may feel a sense of gratitude toward his bene-
                     factor, but at the same time he may also be filled with such
                     shame and embarrassment that he seeks to avoid the company
                     of even the one who pardoned him. Though pardoned, he may
                     feel hardly better than a released criminal. His self-respect is
                     gone, and there is little motivation for a life of righteousness.
                         "If justification meant no more than that, it would actually
                     work against God's plan for our restoration. The only way in
                     which the divine image can be restored in fallen man is by a
                     confident and loving fellowship with Christ by faith."—SDA

             Part 1        "For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made

                       law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but
                       after the Spirit."
                          Paul presents two ways of looking at the law of God. When
                       the sinner looks at the law, it convicts him of sin and con-
                       demns him to death, and Paul calls it the "law of sin and
                       death." But when a person believes in Jesus Christ and re-
                       ceives His Spirit, he sees the law in a different light—it is the
                       "law of the Spirit of life." A saving relationship with Jesus
                       Christ changes man's relation to the law because he is no
                       longer condemned—Jesus, through the Spirit, is enabling him
                       to keep the law. Then that which was impossible will be made
                       possible: "The righteousness of the law" will be "fulfilled in
                       us." To show that it is possible for a human being to do this
                       by God's grace, Christ came to this earth as a human being
                       and lived a sinless life by combining divinity with humanity.
                       We may also combine divinity with our humanity through the
                       indwelling Christ; thus we too will be enabled to obey.
                          "As we discern the perfection of our Saviour's character
                       we shall desire to become wholly transformed and renewed in
                       the image of His purity. The more we know of God, the higher
                       will be our ideal of character and the more earnest our longing
                       to reflect His likeness. A divine element combines with the
                       human when the soul reaches out after God and the longing
                       heart can say, 'My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my ex-
                       pectation is from Him.' Ps. 62:5."—Thoughts From the Mount

 THINK IT THROUGH          God needs my cooperation that the law of the Spirit of
                       life in Christ Jesus be able to operate in my life.

                          "Christ is the ladder that Jacob saw, the base resting on
                       the earth, and the topmost round reaching to the gate of
                       heaven, to the very threshold of glory. If that ladder had failed
                       by a single step of reaching the earth, we should have been
                       lost. But Christ reaches us where we are. He took our nature
                       and overcame, that we through taking His nature might over-
                       come. Made 'in the likeness of sinful flesh' (Rom. 8:3), He lived
                       a sinless life. Now by His divinity He lays hold upon the throne
                       of heaven, while by His humanity He reaches us. He bids us
                       by faith in Him attain to the glory of the character of God."

           Part 2     What two elements does Paul attribute to the gospel?
  POWER THROUGH
          CHRIST      "For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is
     Rom. 1:16, 11 the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth;
                    to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. For therein is the
                    righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is
                    written, The just shall live by faith."


                        Salvation requires power. Man has no power in himself to
                    overcome sinfulness. The whole current of his motives is, apart
                    from divine help, self-centered. The good news is that Jesus
                    Christ has the power to change the motives to be God-centered.
                    One part of salvation is to restore man to loyalty to God. The
                    power that produces this change is the Holy Spirit, the repre-
                    sentative of Jesus. This power is provided to those who have
                    faith in Jesus.

                       What does Paul call Christ? 1 Cor. 1:24.


                       "All power is given into His hands, that He may dispense
                    rich gifts unto men, imparting the priceless gift of His own
                    righteousness to the helpless human agent. This is the message
                    that God commanded to be given to the world."—Testimonies
                    to Ministers, page 92.
                       "The Spirit of God impresses the truth on the heart. The
                    gospel is called the power of God unto salvation because God
                    alone can make the truth a power which sanctifies the soul.
                    He alone can render the cross of Christ triumphant."—Ellen G.
                    White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 7, p. 940.

 THINK IT THROUGH      Why might some persons in Paul's day think that the gos-
                    pel was something of which to be ashamed?


                       "Divine power will unite with our efforts, and as we cling
                    to God with the hand of faith, Christ will impart to us His wis-
                    dom and His righteousness."—Evangelism, page 596.
                       "Through divine grace, supernatural power is imparted to
                    the man, and works in mind and heart and character. It is
                    through the impartation of the grace of Christ that sin is dis-

                       body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of
                       righteousness."

                          "It is through the Spirit that Christ dwells in us; and the
                       Spirit of God, received into the heart by faith, is the beginning
                       of the life eternal."—The Desire of Ages, page 388.
                          "The Spirit was to be given as a regenerating agent, and
                       without this the sacrifice of Christ would have been of no
                       avail. The power of evil had been strengthening for centuries,
                       and the submission of men to this satanic captivity was amaz-
                       ing. Sin could be resisted and overcome only through the
                       mighty agency of the Third Person of the Godhead, who would
                       come with no modified energy, but in the fullness of divine
                       power. It is the Spirit that makes effectual what has been
                       wrought out by the world's redeemer. It is by the Spirit that
                       the heart is made pure. Through the Spirit the believer becomes
                       a partaker of the divine nature. Christ has given His Spirit as
                       a divine power to overcome all hereditary and cultivated ten-
                       dencies to evil, and to impress His own character upon His
                       church."—The Desire of Ages, page 671.
                          What is the purpose of Christ dwelling in the believer's
                       heart? Eph. 3:17-19.

                          "Everything good in men and women is the fruit of the work-
                       ing of the Holy Spirit. The Spirit teaches us to reveal righteous-
                       ness in our lives. The greatest work that can be done in our
                       world is to glorify God by living the character of Christ. God
                       will make perfect only those who will die to self. Those who
                       are willing to do this can say, 'I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth
                       in me.' "—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary,
                       Vol. 6, p. 1109.

 THINK IT THROUGH        What did Paul mean when he said: "I am crucified with
                       Christ"? How can I make this a reality in my life?

                          "The atonement of Christ is not a mere skillful way to have
                       our sins pardoned; it is a divine remedy for the cure of trans-
                       gression and the restoration of spiritual health. It is the Heaven-
                       ordained means by which the righteousness of Christ may be
                       not only upon us but in our hearts and characters."—Ellen G.

Christ's Imparted Righteousness        LESSON 7                    ❑ Wednesday
                                                                     February 13

           Part 4       "But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made
CHRIST SANCTIFIES    unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and
                     redemption."
       1 Cor. 1:30
        Heb. 10:10
                         "By the which will we are sanctified through the offering
                     of the body of Jesus Christ once for all."

                         In our text the apostle places the terms "righteousness"
                     and "sanctification" side by side. They are closely related.
                     "Righteousness" refers to the condition that the process of
                     "sanctification" seeks to bring about, although the word "sanc-
                     tification" can also be used to refer to this condition of righ-
                     teousness.
                         "By the word and the Spirit of God are opened to men the
                     great principles of righteousness embodied in His law. And
                     since the law of God is 'holy, and just, and good,' a transcript
                     of the divine perfection, it follows that a character formed by
                     obedience to that law will be holy. Christ is a perfect example
                     of such a character. He says: 'I have kept My Father's com-
                     mandments.' 1 do always those things that please Him.' John
                     15:10; 8:29. The followers of Christ are to become like Him—by
                     the grace of God to form characters in harmony with the prin-
                     ciples of His holy law. This is Bible sanctification.
                          "This work can be accomplished only through faith in
                     Christ, by the power of the indwelling Spirit of God."—The
                     Great Controversy, page 469.
                          According to the apostle Peter, what is the result of sanc-
                     tification? 1 Peter 1:2.

                         "Sanctification is not the work of a moment, an hour, or a
                     day. It is a continual growth in grace. . . . As long as Satan
                     reigns we shall have self to subdue, besetments to overcome,
                     and there is no stopping place, there is no point to which we
                     can come and say we have fully attained."—Testimonies, Vol.
                     1, p. 340.

 THINK IT THROUGH       What are the elements that contribute to sanctification?

                         "The Scriptures plainly show that the work of sanctification
                     is progressive. When in conversion the sinner finds peace with
                     God through the blood of the atonement, the Christian life has
                     but just begun. Now he is to 'go on unto perfection;' to grow
                     up 'unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.'
                     Says the apostle Paul: 'this one thing I do, . . . I press toward
                     the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ
                     Jesus.' Phil. 3:13, 14."—The Great Controversy, page 470.

              Part 5      How are the results of sanctification achieved?
        RESULTS OF
                          "Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth."
     SANCTIFICATION
         John 17:17        Belief of the truth that God has revealed to men results in
                       sanctification. The principles of God's character are the basic
                       truth revealed, and as people believe the truth and practice it
                       the principles of God's character are being fashioned into
                       human personality. God is love; and Jesus taught that love to
                       God and man sums up the whole law. As the believer is sanc-
                       tified he is being made into a loving person patterned after the
                       loving heavenly Father. This love in the Christian person is the
                       same love as is in the character of God, revealed in Jesus
                       Christ, and defined in the law. So the basic result of sanctifica-
                       tion is love to God and man.
                           "Those who receive the Saviour become sons of God. . . .
                       They are adopted into God's family, and they become con-
                       formed to His likeness, changed by His Spirit from glory to
                       glory. From cherishing supreme love for self, they come to
                       cherish supreme love for God and for Christ. . . . Accepting
                       Christ as a personal Saviour, and following His example of
                       self-denial—this is the secret of holiness."—Ellen G. White
                       Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 6, p. 1117.
                          How is the truth understood? John 16:13.
                          "Let a living faith run like threads of gold through the per-
                       formance of even the smallest duties. Then all the daily work
                       will promote Christian growth. There will be a continual look-
                       ing unto Jesus. Love for Him will give vital force to everything
                       that is undertaken. Thus through the right use of our talents,
                       we may link ourselves by a golden chain to the higher world.
                       This is true sanctification; for sanctification consists in the
                       cheerful performance of daily duties in perfect obedience to
                       the will of God."—Christ's Object Lessons, "Talents," page
                       360.
 THINK IT THROUGH          As I compare my life with the life of Jesus, what deficien-
                       cies do I find in myself? What virtues do I find in Him that
                       I desire to acquire?
                           "The most precious fruit of sanctification is the grace of
                       meekness. When this grace presides in the soul, the disposi-
                       tion is molded by its influence. There is a continual waiting
                       upon God and a submission of the will to His. . . . True meek-
                       ness softens and subdues the heart, and gives the mind a
                       fitness for the engrafted word. It brings the thoughts into obe-
                       dience to Jesus Christ."—The Sanctified Life, pages 14, 15.

Christ's Imparted Righteousness          LESSON 7                         ❑ Friday
                                                                         February 15

             Part 6      "And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he
 ABIDING IN CHRIST    shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed
                      before him at his coming. If ye know that he is righteous, ye
    1 John 2:28, 29   know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him."


                          To abide in Jesus means to remain or stay in relationship
                      with Him, just as a live branch has a close connection with the
                      parent stalk. This connection must be maintained if the branch
                      is to live. By maintaining a close relationship with Christ we
                      can do righteousness, thus living the kind of life Jesus lived
                      in this world. The parable of the vine, where the word "abide"
                      is also used, is an illustration of sanctification.

                         How essential is it that the believer abide in Christ? John
                      15:5.

                         " 'Abide in Me, and I in you.' Abiding in Christ means a
                      constant receiving of His Spirit, a life of unreserved surrender
                      to His service. The channel of communication must be open
                      continually between man and his God. As the vine branch con-
                      stantly draws the sap from the living vine, so are we to cling
                      to Jesus, and receive from Him by faith the strength and per-
                      fection of His own character....
                         "The life of the vine will be manifest in fragrant fruit on the
                      branches. 'He that abideth in Me,' said Jesus, 'and I in him,
                      the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without Me ye can do
                      nothing.' When we live by faith on the Son of God, the fruits
                      of the Spirit will be seen in our life; not one will be missing."
                      —The Desire of Ages, page 676.

 THINK IT THROUGH        How does the mutual abiding of the believer and Christ
                      take place?

                          "This union with Christ, once formed, must be maintained.
                      Christ said, 'Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot
                      bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye,
                      except ye abide in Me.' This is no casual touch, no off-and-on
                      connection. The branch becomes a part of the living vine. The
                      communication of life, strength, and fruitfulness from the root
                      to the branches is unobstructed and constant. Separated from
                      the vine, the branch cannot live. No more, said Jesus, can you
                      live apart from Me. The life you have received from Me can
                      be preserved only by continual communion. Without Me you
                      cannot overcome one sin, or resist one temptation."—The

                    the trunk to the branches is unobstructed and constant. The
                    root sends its nourishment through the branch. Such is the
                    true believer's relation to Christ. He abides in Christ and draws
                    his nourishment from Him.
                        "This spiritual relation can be established only by the ex-
                    ercise of personal faith."—Testimonies, Vol. 5, p. 229.
                        "A union with Christ by living faith is enduring; every other
                    union must perish. Christ first chose us, paying an infinite price
                    for our redemption; and the true believer chooses Christ as
                    first and last and best in everything. But this union costs us
                    something. It is a union of utter dependence, to be entered into
                    by a proud being. All who form this union must feel their need
                    of the atoning blood of Christ. They must have a change of
                    heart. They must submit their own will to the will of God. There
                    will be a struggle with outward and internal obstacles. There
                    must be a painful work of detachment as well as a work of
                    attachment. Pride, selfishness, vanity, worldliness—sin in all
                    its forms—must be overcome if we would enter into a union
                    with Christ."—Testimonies, Vol. 5, p. 231.

                        "But though Christ is everything, we are to inspire every
                    man to unwearied diligence. We are to strive, wrestle, agonize,
                    watch, pray, lest we shall be overcome by the wily foe. For the
                    power and grace with which we can do this comes from God,
                    and all the while we are to trust in Him, who is able to save
                    to the uttermost all who come unto God by Him. Never leave
                    the impression on the mind that there is little or nothing to do
                    on the part of man; but rather teach man to cooperate with

              Part 2       What was the "one thing" that Paul states he did in his
     PRESS TOWARD      life?
         THE MARK         "Not as though I had already attained, either were al-
       Phil. 3:12-14   ready perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend
                       that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.
                       Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this
                       one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and
                       reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press
                       toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in
                       Christ Jesus."

                           Read also 1 Cor. 9:24-27.
                           The apostle Paul compares the Christian life to an athletic
                       contest. There is a race to be run and a prize to be won. In
                       Hebrews 12:1, 2, he gives the secret of success in this race.
                       To lay every weight and sin aside and perseveringly run the
                       race, "looking to Jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our Faith."
                       RSV.
                           "Such is not the case in the Christian warfare. Not one who
                       complies with the conditions will be disappointed at the end
                       of the race. Not one who is earnest and persevering will fail
                       of success. The race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the
                       strong. The weakest saint, as well as the strongest, may wear
                       the crown of immortal glory. All may win who, through the
                       power of divine grace, bring their lives into conformity to the
                       will of Christ. The practice, in the details of life, of the prin-
                       ciples laid down in God's word, is too often looked upon as
                       unimportant—a matter too trivial to demand attention. But in
                       view of the issue at stake, nothing is small that will help or
                       hinder. Every act casts its weight into the scale that determines
                       life's victory or defeat. And the reward given to those who win
                       will be in proportion to the energy and earnestness with which
                       they have striven."—The Acts of the Apostles, pages 313, 314.

 THINK IT THROUGH        We have noted resemblances between the Christian life
                       and ancient games. What are the differences?

                           "It is not mimic battles in which we are engaged. We are
                       waging a warfare upon which hang eternal results. We have
                       unseen enemies to meet. Evil angels are striving for the do-
                       minion of every human being. Whatever injures the health, not
                       only lessens physical vigor, but tends to weaken the mental and
                       moral powers. Indulgence in any unhealthful practice makes it
                       more difficult for one to discriminate between right and wrong,
                       and hence more difficult to resist evil. It increases the danger
                       of failure and defeat."—The Ministry of Healing, page 128.

            Part 3      Why must there be a "fight of faith"?
  FIGHT THE GOOD        "Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life."
   FIGHT OF FAITH
                        "Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to
       1 Tim. 6:12
                     stand against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not
      Eph. 6:11.13   against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against
                     powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world,
                     against spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore take
                     unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to
                     withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand."

                         "God's servants are to put on every piece of the Christian
                     armor. We are not wrestling simply with human foes. God calls
                     upon every Christian to enter the warfare and fight under His
                     leadership, depending for success on the grace and help of
                     Heaven.
                         "We are to go forward in the strength of the Mighty One.
                     Never are we to yield to Satan's attacks. Why should not we,
                     as Christian warriors, stand against principalities and powers,
                     and against the rulers of the darkness of this world? God calls
                     upon us to press forward, using the gifts entrusted to us. Satan
                     will place temptation before us. He will try to overcome us by
                     stratagem. But in the strength of God we are to stand firm as
                     a rock to principle."—Testimonies, Vol. 9, pp. 219, 220.
                         This detailed counsel of the apostle Paul has in it the as-
                     surance of victory in the Christian warfare.
                         "When we lay hold of Christ by faith, our work has just be-
                      gun. Every man has corrupt and sinful habits that must be
                     overcome by vigorous warfare. Every soul is required to fight
                      the fight of faith."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Com-
                     mentary, Vol. 6, p. 1111.
                         "Christ has given us no assurance that to attain to perfec-
                      tion of character is an easy matter. It is a conflict, a battle and
                      a march, day by day."—Sons and Daughters of God, page 198.

 THINK IT THROUGH        As I check each part of the Christian armor, do 1 find that
                     I have put on all its parts?
                        "A noble, all-round character is not inherited. It does not
                     come to us by accident. A noble character is earned by in-
                     dividual effort through the merits and grace of Christ. God
                     gives the talents, the powers of the mind; we form the char-
                     acter. It is formed by hard, stern battles with self. Conflict after
                     conflict must be waged against hereditary tendencies. We shalt
                     have to criticize ourselves closely, and allow not one unfavor-
                     able trait to remain uncorrected."—Christ's Object Lessons,

             Part 4 "Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin
FEED ON THE WORD against thee."
        Ps. 119:11
                    "All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is prof-
    2 Tim. 3:16, 11
                     itable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
                     righteousness: that the man of God may be perfect, throughly
                     furnished unto all good works."

                        The study of the Scriptures is profitable for more than just
                     "doctrine," or a knowledge of salvation. In it we find "instruc-
                     tion in righteousness," or "discipline in right living." NEB. Such
                     instruction, if acted upon, will bring forth "good works."
                        "Temptations often appear irresistible because, through
                     neglect of prayer and the study of the Bible, the tempted one
                     cannot readily remember God's promises and meet Satan with
                     the Scripture weapons. But angels are round about those who
                     are willing to be taught in divine things; and in the time of
                     great necessity they will bring to their remembrance the very
                     truths which are needed. Thus 'when the enemy shall come in
                     like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard
                     against him.' Isa. 59:19."—The Great Controversy, page 600.
                        What is to be our relationship to what we learn from the
                     study of the Scriptures? James 1:21, 22.

                         What did Christ pray that the "Word" would do for His
                     followers? John 17:17.

                        "As we meditate upon the perfections of the Saviour, we
                     shall desire to be wh011y transformed and renewed in the image
                     of His purity. There will be a hungering and thirsting of soul
                     to become like Him whom we adore."—Steps to Christ, page 89.

 THINK IT THROUGH       Why is it essential to study the Word before the moment
                     that help is needed?

                        "Jesus promised His disciples: 'The Comforter, which is the
                     Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in My name, He shall
                     teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance,
                     whatsoever I have said unto you.' John 14:26. But the teachings
                     of Christ must previously have been stored in the mind in order
                     for the Spirit of God to bring them to our remembrance in the
                     time of peril. 'Thy word have I hid in mine heart,' said David,
                     'that I might not sin against Thee.' "—The Great Controversy,

           Part 5       "Commit thy way unto the Lord; trust also in him; and he
     DILIGENCE IN    shall bring it to pass."
          PRAYER         "For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in
          Ps. 31:5   a time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of
          Ps. 32:6   great waters they shall not come nigh unto him."
       lames 5:16      "The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth
                     much."

                        Through prayer we make our wishes known to the heavenly
                     Father. Through prayer we give thanks for blessings received.
                     But more than this, through communion with heaven we keep
                     in contact, yes, we maintain that union, which makes possible
                     the reception of strength for every need in developing a righ-
                     teous character.
                        "Give to God the most precious offering that it is possible
                     for you to make; give Him your heart. He speaks to you say-
                     ing, 'My son, My daughter, give Me thine heart.' . . . When
                     clothed in My righteousness, through prayer, through watchful-
                     ness, through diligent study of My Word, you will be able to
                     reach a high standard.' "—Sons and Daughters of God, page
                     98.
                       How constantly shall we seek the Lord? 1 Thess. 5:17;
                     Luke 18:1; Eph. 6:18.

                       What assurance has Christ given that our prayers will be
                     heard and answered? Matt. 7:7, 8; Matt. 21:22.

 THINK IT THROUGH       What promises from the Bible in which God has assured
                     you of strength from heaven to do the right thing can you
                     remember at this moment?

                        "The darkness of the evil one encloses those who neglect
                     to pray. The whispered temptations of the enemy entice them
                     to sin; and it is all because they do not make use of the privi-
                     leges that God has given them in the divine appointment of
                     prayer. Why should the sons and daughters of God be reluc-
                     tant to pray, when prayer is the key in the hand of faith to un-
                     lock heaven's storehouse, where are treasured the boundless
                     resources of Omnipotence? Without unceasing prayer and dili-
                     gent watching we are in danger of growing careless and of
                     deviating from the right path. The adversary seeks continually
                     to obstruct the way to the mercy seat, that we may not by ear-
                     nest supplication and faith obtain grace and power to resist

          THE END
                         "Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when
        Matt. 24:13
                      he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord
        James 1:12    hath promised to them that love him."

                          The words of the wise man, that "the race is not to the
                      swift" (Eccl. 9:11), could well apply to the Christian race.
                          "The work of salvation is not child's play, to be taken hold
                      of at will and let alone at pleasure. It is the steady purpose, the
                      untiring effort, that will gain the victory at last. It is he who

                          The Revised Standard Version of verse 36 reads: "For you

            Part 1       In the King James Version the word "faith" is a translation
   WHAT IS FAITH?    of the Greek word "pistis." "There is a basic similarity between
                     the Greek words usually translated 'believe,' belief,' and 'faith'
                     in the King James Version. 'Believe' is pisteuo. 'Belief' is pistis.
                     'Faith' is also from pistis. 'Not believe' is apisteo. 'Unbelief' is
                     apistia."—SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 6, p. 496. The dictionary
                     meaning of the English word faith when it refers to the attitude
                     of man toward God is "belief and trust in and loyalty to God."
                         But faith is not a strictly religious term, and its use in reli-
                     gion is not limited to Christianity. Ellen G. White notes that
                      "faith is the medium through which truth or error finds a lodging
                     place in the mind. It is by the same act of mind that truth or
                     error is received."—Selected Messages, Bk. 1, p. 346. Many
                     financial transactions are carried out by faith. The use of credit
                      cards is an example of faith exercised by both the user and
                     issuer of the card. There is confidence on the part of the card
                     user that the company which issued it will supply goods or
                      services on credit as it has promised to do. The company ex-
                     ercises faith in the card user. The credit card indicates that
                      the issuing company has confidence that the user has the
                      capacity and intention of fulfilling his obligations. Other exam-
                      ples of faith in ordinary life are check cashing, delivery service,
                      surgical operations, and marriage. In each instance there is
                      confidence on the part of one person that the other person is
                      able and willing to make good on his promise.

                     false documents that raise false hopes in those who made a
                     bad investment. The statement is made in the context of faith
                     in God. Faith is the title because God is the one who made the
                     promise on which the hope is based; faith is the evidence
                     because the faith is in God who has revealed the unseen; and,
                     since God knows the unseen and He does not lie, then man
                     can accept the unseen as realities.
                         What makes faith in God appear so drastically different from
                     faith toward other persons is the scope covered (1) by what
                     God promises, (2) by what He is able to do, and (3) by the
                     degree of loyalty He requires. Christian faith is man's response
                     to God's revelations which have come to him in Jesus, the
                     Scriptures, nature, and God's providences. This faith must be
                     all-absorbing for the one who holds it, because the information,
                     commands, and promises contained in God's revelations relate
                     to every sphere of man's life, the whole span of his existence,
                     and require of him full allegiance and loyalty to God. Faith in
                     God is confidence in what He says. His information is correct.
                     He is able to keep His promises, and He intends to keep them.
                     Because His commands are the best way for man to live they
                     should be obeyed.
                         "Faith is trusting God—believing that He loves us and knows
                     best what is for our good. Thus, instead of our own, it leads us
                     to choose His way. In place of our ignorance, it accepts His
                     wisdom; in place of our weakness, His strength; in place of
                     our sinfulness, His righteousness. Our lives, ourselves, are al-
                     ready His; faith acknowledges His ownership and accepts its
                     blessing. Truth, uprightness, purity, have been pointed out as
                     secrets of life's success. It is faith that puts us in possession
                     of these principles."—Education, page 253.
                         "Said the angel: 'Feeling is not faith. Faith is simply to take
                     God at His word.' "—Testimonies, Vol. 1, p. 620.

 THINK IT THROUGH       How can I develop greater faith in God?

                        "God will do marvelous things for those who trust in Him ...
                     He will help His believing children in every emergency, if they
                     will place their entire confidence in Him and implicitly obey
                     Him."—Testimonies, Vol. 4, p. 163.

Faith and Salvation LESSON 9                                            ❑ Tuesday
                                                                        February 26

           Part 3     What two facts about God are part of the content of faith
  THE IMPORTANCE in God?
         OF FAITH     "But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he
         Heb. 11:6 that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a
                    rewarder of them that diligently seek him."

                        To have faith in a person, the person must exist and have
                    communicated something about himself to the other, usually by
                    words. If one has faith in the person, he believes that the com-
                    munication is a true reflection of reality. If he doubts the word
                    he hears, then there is no basis for faith in that person. That is
                    what happened when Adam and Eve sinned. They doubted
                    God's statement that they would die if they ate of the forbidden
                    tree. As sin entered the world by lack of faith, righteousness
                    comes to the believer by exercise of faith. God does not ask
                    us first of all to be good, but to believe God, and thus become
                    good.
                        "If we commit the keeping of our souls to God in the exer-
                    cise of living faith, His promises will not fail us; for they have
                    no limit but our faith."—My Life Today, page 14.
                        But while faith is so important to the Christian life, there is
                    no virtue in faith itself to save the believer.
                         "Through faith we receive the grace of God; but faith is not
                    our Saviour. It earns nothing. It is the hand by which we lay
                    hold upon Christ, and appropriate His merits, the remedy for
                    sin."—The Desire of Ages, page 175.
                         "Faith is not the ground of our salvation, but it is the great
                     blessing—the eye that sees, the ear that hears, the feet that
                    run, the hand that grasps. It is the means, not the end."—Ellen
                    G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 6, p. 1073.
                        The benefits of faith come because the faith is in God, and
                     not merely because one has faith. Faith in and of itself can do
                    nothing.
                         Faith must be backed up by promise or it is presumptuous.
                         We have faith in the surgeon for surgery and faith in the
                     banker for banking because these are the promises inherent
                     in their professions. In the same way our faith must correspond
                     to what God has communicated to us.

 THINK IT THROUGH      "Faith familiarizes the soul with the existence and presence
                    of God, and, living with an eye single to the glory of God, more
                    and more we discern the beauty of His character, the excel-
                    lence of His grace. Our souls become strong in spiritual power;
                    for we are breathing the atmosphere of heaven, and realizing
                    that God is at our right hand, that we shall not be moved."—

              Part 4      What is the evidence of a living faith?
     PROOF OF FAITH       "Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone."
      lames 2:11, 26      "For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith with-
                       out works is dead also."
                           Faith is an attitude hidden within the person's mind that is
                       inconsequential unless it breaks out in action. The faith that
                       believes a doctrine, James argues, is held by the devils, but
                       they do nothing about it and remain devils. A faith held in the
                       mind of devils or of people is a dead faith.
                           To separate faith from works is the same as to separate the
                       gospel from the law, or faith from love, or doctrine from ex-
                       perience.
                           The object of faith is to make a person loving in the way
                       that God is loving. And so when a person has true faith in God
                       the acts he does are acts of love. Paul described it as "faith
                       working through love." Gal. 5:6, RSV.
                           "While true faith trusts wholly in Christ for salvation, it
                       will lead to perfect conformity to the law of God. Faith is
                       manifested by works. And the apostle John declares, 'He that
                       saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a
                       liar.'"—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol.
                       6, p. 1073.
                           "How different is the faith that is presented to the world
                       to-day as essential to salvation. It has no vitality, no reality.
                       It does not unite the believers as branches to the living Vine.
                       It is not the faith that works by love and purifies the soul. It
                       is a formal, nominal acceptance of a popular story, and has
                       about as much efficacy as the faith that accepted Abraham
                       Lincoln as a good administrator of governmental affairs. Gen-
                       uine faith will show definite results in the character, and will
                       exert a controlling influence over the thoughts of the heart, and
                        the affairs of the life. It will lead its possessor to practice the
                       principles of his belief....
                            "It is the doing of the words and works of Christ that testifies
                        to the saving qualities of your faith."—Ellen G. White, Signs of
                       the Times, March 30, 1888.

 THINK IT THROUGH         In what ways do I hold a correct belief which I do not
                       practice?
                            "The apostle James saw that dangers would arise in present-
                       ing the subject of justification by faith, and he labored to show
                       that genuine faith cannot exist without corresponding works.
                       . . . Thus genuine faith does a genuine work in the believer.
                       Faith and obedience bring a solid, valuable experience."—Ellen

           Part 5      What is the source of man's faith?
     SOURCE AND
                       "For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man
    DEVELOPMENT
                    that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than
         OF FAITH   he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath
        Rom. 12:3   dealt to every man the measure of faith."

                       Man's faith in God is not a capacity that belongs to human
                    nature, but it is a gift from God.
                       "The Spirit operating upon and enlightening the human
                    mind, creates faith in God. In the Scriptures faith is stated to
                    be the gift of God, powerful unto salvation, enlightening the
                    hearts of those who search for truth as for hidden treasure.
                    The Spirit of God impresses the truth on the heart."—Ellen G.
                    White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 7, p. 940.

                       On what is faith based? Rom 10:17.

                        "Faith that enables us to receive God's gifts is itself a gift,
                    of which some measure is imparted to every human being. It
                    grows as exercised in appropriating the word of God. In order
                    to strengthen faith, we must often bring it in contact with the
                    word."—Education, pages 253, 254.
                        "Faith is the gift of God, but the power to exercise it is
                    ours."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 431.
                        Faith grows by exercise. In Romans 1:17 Paul wrote, "For
                    therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to
                    faith."
                       "From faith to faith. Compare 'from glory to glory' (2 Cor.
                    3:18) and 'from strength to strength' (Ps. 84:7). The righteous-
                    ness of God is received by faith, and when received, results
                    in ever-increasing faith."—SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 6, pp.
                    476, 477.

 THINK IT THROUGH      What am I doing that my faith may grow stronger from
                    day to day? What effect can my trust in God and His prom-
                    ises today have upon my confidence in Him tomorrow?

                       "Faith is needed in the smaller no less than in the greater
                    affairs of life. In all our daily interests and occupations the sus-
                    taining strength of God becomes real to us through an abiding
                    trust."—Education, page 255.
                       "Let us not talk doubt, but faith; for faith brings infinite
                    power. If we lay hold upon this power, and do not trust in our
                    own human strength, we shall see the salvation of God."—

            Part 6        "For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of
FAITH AND CHRIST'S      yourselves: it is the gift of God."
    RIGHTEOUSNESS           The righteousness of Christ is God's character perfectly ex-
           Eph. 2:8     pressed in Christ's human life. To have faith in Christ is to
                        consent to the character of God which Christ lived out on
                        earth, and to desire that character.
                            "In order for man to be justified by faith, faith must reach
                        a point where it will control the affections and impulses of the
                        heart; and it is by obedience that faith itself is made perfect."
                        —Selected Messages, Bk. 1, p. 366.
                            Note that the faith is incomplete until there is obedience.
                        Sanctification is obedience by faith. Justification makes this
                        obedience by faith possible, and sanctification causes justifica-
                        tion to be retained. See Selected Messages, Bk. 1, p. 366.
                            "When we trust God fully, when we rely upon the merits of
                        Jesus as a sin-pardoning Saviour, we shall receive all the help
                        that we can desire. Let none look to self, as though they had
                        power to save themselves. Jesus died for us because we were
                        helpless to do this. In Him is our hope, our justification, our
                        righteousness. When we see our sinfulness, we should not de-
                        spond and fear that we have no Saviour, or that He has no
                        thoughts of mercy toward us. At this very time He is inviting
                        us to come to Him in our helplessness and be saved."—Pa-
                        triarchs and Prophets, page 431.
                           What was God's purpose in placing "exceeding great and
                        precious promises" in His Word? 2 Peter 1:4.

                           "Christ's humanity was united with divinity; He was fitted
                        for the conflict by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. And He
                        came to make us partakers of the divine nature. So long as we
                        are united to Him by faith, sin has no more dominion over us.
                        God reaches for the hand of faith in us to direct it to lay fast
                        hold upon the divinity of Christ, that we may attain to perfec-
                        tion of character."—The Desire of Ages, page 123.

 THINK IT THROUGH          Is there some weakness or habit in my life that I have not
                        been able to overcome? By faith I can "lay fast hold upon
                        the divinity of Christ" at this very moment. With Him on my

    "Again, the kingdom of
heaven is like unto a mer-
chant man, seeking goodly
pearls: who, when he had
found one pearl of great price,
went and sold all that he had,
and bought it." Man. 13:45,
46.
    In the Scriptures great truths have
often been presented in simple ways.
The Bible abounds in experiences and
illustrations to bring its message home
to the soul.
    The important theme of "Christ our
Righteousness" has been illustrated by
figures and symbols so that the truths
it contains may be more readily under-
stood—so that those who understand
may reach out and receive Christ into
their lives. Such common things as salt
and yeast have been used to teach the
way of life. And yet, while the truths
taught by such illustrations may appear
simple, they also have a depth of mean-
ing that is profound. So let us beware
that when we grasp the simple, evident
truths in each instance we do not dis-
miss them as unworthy of further study.

           Part 1       "And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season
             SALT    with salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of
                     thy God to be lacking from thy meat offering: with all thine
         Lev. 2:13   offerings thou shalt offer salt."

                         A child, when asked what salt is, answered: "that which,
                     if left out, makes the food taste bad."

                          So with the Christian life. If the salt is lacking, all else that
                     man can do will still make his life incomplete. What is this
                     salt?
                          "In the ritual service, salt was added to every sacrifice. This
                     . . . signified that only the righteousness of Christ could make
                     the service acceptable to God. Referring to this practice, Jesus
                     said, 'Every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.' Have salt in
                     yourselves, and have peace one with another.' All who would
                     present themselves 'a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto
                     God' (Rom. 12:1), must receive the saving salt, the righteous-
                     ness of our Saviour."—The Desire of Ages, page 439.
                        Can you harmonize this thought, that salt represents the
                     righteousness of Christ, with what Jesus says about salt in
                     Matthew 5:13?
                         "Salt must be mingled with the substance to which it is
                     added; it must penetrate and infuse in order to preserve. So
                     it is through personal contact and association that men are
                     reached by the saving power of the gospel. They are not saved
                     in masses, but as individuals. Personal influence is a power.
                     We must come close to those whom we desire to benefit."—
                     Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, page 36.
                         " 'Ye are the salt of the earth,' Jesus said. Do not withdraw
                     yourselves from the world in order to escape persecution. You
                     are to abide among men, that the savor of the divine love may
                     be as salt to preserve the world from corruption."—The Desire
                     of Ages, page 306.

 THINK IT THROUGH        What is represented by flavorless salt?

                         "The savor of the salt represents the vital power of the
                     Christian—the love of Jesus in the heart, the righteousness of
                     Christ pervading the life. ... The sincere believers diffuse vital
                     energy, which is penetrating and imparts new moral power to
                     the souls for whom they labor. It is not the power of the man
                     himself, but the power of the Holy Spirit that does the trans-

                           Like salt, yeast is an element that comes from the outside,

     Ex. 30:1,1, 8   ing: when he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn incense upon
                     it. And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn
                     incense upon it, a perpetual incense before the Lord through-
                     out your generations."
                        Incense has been used to provide a pleasant fragrance in a
                     situation that had a bad odor. The bad odor represents sin,
                     which God abhors. The symbolic use of incense in the sanc-
                     tuary teaches that the sinner, to whom the "odor" of sin clings,
                     can be acceptable to God only by His coming to God through
                     the "sweet smelling" righteousness of Christ.
                       In John's description of opening the seventh seal, with
                     what was incense mingled? Rev. 8:3, 4.
                        "The religious services, the prayers, the praise, the penitent
                     confession of sin ascend from true believers as incense to the
                     heavenly sanctuary, but passing through the corrupt channels
                     of humanity, they are so defiled that unless purified by blood,
                     they can never be of value with God. They ascend not in spot-
                     less purity, and unless the Intercessor, who is at God's right
                     hand, presents and purifies all by His righteousness, it is not
                     acceptable to God.... He gathers into this censer the prayers,
                     the praise, and the confessions of His people, and with these
                     He puts His own spotless righteousness... .
                         "Oh, that all may see that everything, in obedience, in peni-
                     tence, in praise and thanksgiving, must be placed upon the
                     glowing fire of the righteousness of Christ. The fragrance of
                     this righteousness ascends like a cloud around the mercy seat."

                     teousness, which through faith is imputed to His people, and
                     which can alone make the worship of sinful beings acceptable
                     to God."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 353.
                        "Before the believer is held out the wonderful possibility of
                     being like Christ, obedient to all the principles of the law. But

                     Man's obedience can be made perfect only by the incense of
                     Christ's righteousness, which fills with divine fragrance every
                     act of obedience. The part of the Christian is to persevere in

                       2 Peter 1:19.

                          Peter declared that the prophetic word is like "a fight that
                       shineth in a dark place." And that prophetic light also has its
                       source in Him who is the Sun of Righteousness. The whole
                       prophetic Word is "the revelation of Jesus Christ" (Rev. 1:1)
                       just as is the book of Revelation to which these words primarily
                       referred.
                          At a time when men were being called to obedience to all
                       the commandments of God (Rev. 12:17; Rev. 14:12), God sent
                       a special message to his people that was given emphasis at
                       the Minneapolis General Conference in 1888. The following is
                       a comment on the blessings that came through that message:
                          "Those who received the message were greatly blessed, for
                       they saw the bright rays of the Sun of Righteousness, and life
                       and hope sprang up in their hearts. .. . The Sun of Righteous-

Christ's Righteousness in Symbols LESSON 10                             ❑ Thursday
                                                                           March 7

            Part 5     Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant
    THE PEARL OF     man, seeking goodly pearls: who, when he had found one
                     pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and
     GREAT PRICE     bought it."
   Matt. 13:45, 46
                        In this brief parable a man is presented performing four
                     actions—seeking, finding, selling, and buying. The essential
                     feature in the parable is the man's recognition of the value of
                     the pearl he found. Without this recognition there would have
                     been no purchase, and he would presumably have kept on
                     seeking.
                        "It is the Holy Spirit that reveals to men the preciousness
                     of the goodly pearl."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 118.
                         Without the Holy Spirit man would not seek Jesus nor would
                     he recognize His value if he found Him.
                         "Christ Himself is the pearl of great price. In Him is gathered
                     all the glory of the Father, the fulness of the Godhead. . . .
                     Every page of the Holy Scriptures shines with His light. The
                     righteousness of Christ, as a pure, white pearl, has no defect,
                     no stain. No work of man can improve the great and precious
                     gift of God."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 115.
                        What truth did Jesus teach in the parable of the hidden
                     treasure? Matt. 13:44.

                        "Christ is the truth. His words are truth, and they have a
                     deeper significance than appears on the surface. All the say-
                     ings of Christ have a value beyond their unpretending appear-
                     ance. Minds that are quickened by the Holy Spirit will discern
                     the value of these sayings. They will discern the precious gems
                     of truth, though these may be buried treasures."—Christ's
                     Object Lessons, page 110.
 THINK IT THROUGH        What is the difference between the parable of the pearl
                     and the parable of the treasure? What is the meaning of this
                     difference in human experience?

                        "In the parable the pearl is not represented as a gift. The
                     merchantman bought it at the price of all that he had. Many
                     question the meaning of this, since Christ is represented in
                     the Scriptures as a gift. He is a gift, but only to those who give
                     themselves, soul, body, and spirit, to Him without reserve. We
                     are to give ourselves to Christ, to live a life of willing obedience
                     to all His requirements. All that we are, all the talents and
                     capabilities we possess, are the Lord's, to be consecrated to
                     His service. When we thus give ourselves wholly to Him, Christ,
                     with all the treasures of heaven, gives Himself to us. We obtain
                     the pearl of great price."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 116.

             Part 6      What is the purpose of wearing the armor of God?
THE ARMOR OF GOD          "Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that
      Eph. 6:13, 14   ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done
                      all, to stand. Stand therefore, . . . having on the breastplate
                      of righteousness."
                        What is the spiritual meaning of each piece of the armor?
                      Eph. 6:13-17.

                         The Christian life is a constant warfare. When man fights
                      alone, defeat is inevitable. But he need not face the enemy
                      alone; all the powers of heaven will come to his aid so that
                      he may have complete victory.
                         "We fight in a warfare, not against flesh and blood, but
                      against principalities and powers, and against spiritual wicked-
                      ness in high places. See Eph. 6:12. In life's conflict we must
                      meet evil agencies that have arrayed themselves against the
                      right. Our hope is not in man, but in the living God. With full
                      assurance of faith we may expect that he will unite His omnip-
                      otence with the efforts of human instrumentalities, for the glory
                      of His name. Clad with the armor of His righteousness, we may
                      gain the victory over every foe."—Prophets and Kings, page
                      111.
                         "If you pray in sincerity, surrendering yourself, soul, body,
                      and spirit, unto God, you put on the whole armor of God, and
                      open the soul to the righteousness of Christ; and this alone,—
                      Christ's imputed righteousness,—makes you able to stand
                      against the wiles of the devil. The work of every soul is to
                      resist the enemy in the power and might of the Lord Jesus
                      Christ, and the promise is that the devil shall flee from us."
                      —Sons and Daughters of God, page 346.

 THINK IT THROUGH        As armor is the name of the total equipment of the first-
                      century soldier, what is the name of the total of the spiritual
                      counterparts?

                         "Clad in the armor of Christ's righteousness, the church is
                      to enter upon her final conflict. 'Fair as the moon, clear as the
                      sun, and terrible as an army with banners' (Song of Solomon
                      6:10), she is to go forth into all the world, conquering and to
                      conquer.
                         "The darkest hour of the church's struggle with the powers
                      of evil is that which immediately precedes the day of her final
                      deliverance. But none who trust in God need fear; ... God will

 THE TEN VIRGINS I virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the
                   bridegroom. And five of them were wise, and five were fool-
      Matt. 25:1-5 ish. They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil
                     with them: but the wise took oil in their vessels with their
                     lamps. While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and
                     slept."

                        One of the lessons Christ sought to teach by the parable of
                     the ten virgins was that the individual who is waiting for Christ's
                     return must allow the Holy Spirit, represented by the oil, to
                     do His work in the life. The result of this work is represented
                     by the lighted lamp. Without this work, man will not be able to
                     take part in Christ's wedding feast.
                        "The two classes of watchers represent the two classes who
                     profess to be waiting for their Lord. They are called virgins
                     because they profess a pure faith. By the lamps is represented
                     the word of God. The psalmist says, 'Thy word is a lamp unto
                     my feet, and a light unto my path.' Ps. 119:105. The oil is a
                     symbol of the Holy Spirit."—Christ's Object Lessons, pages
                     406, 407.
                        "All had lamps and vessels for oil. . . All have heard the
                     message of Christ's near approach, and confidently expect His
                     appearing. But as in the parable, so it is now. A time of wait-
                     ing intervenes, faith is tried; and when the cry is heard, 'Behold,
                     the Bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet Him,' many are
                     unready. They have no oil in their vessels with their lamps.
                     They are destitute of the Holy Spirit."—Christ's Object Lessons,
                     page 408.

 THINK IT THROUGH       How can I be certain that the Holy Spirit is accomplishing
                     in my life the work that is needed to prepare me to meet
                     Jesus when He comes?

                        "Sin could be resisted and overcome only through the
                     mighty agency of the Third Person of the Godhead, who would
                     come with no modified energy, but in the fulness of divine
                     power. It is the Spirit that makes effectual what has been
                     wrought out by the world's Redeemer. It is by the Spirit that
                     the heart is made pure. Through the Spirit the believer be-
                     comes a partaker of the divine nature. Christ has given His
                     Spirit as a divine power to overcome all hereditary and culti-
                     vated tendencies to evil, and to impress His own character
                     upon His church."—The Desire of Ages, page 671.

             Part 2    "And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the
 THE TEN VIRGINS II bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him. Then all those
                    virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps. And the foolish said
      Matt. 25:6-12 unto  the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone
                    out. But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not
                    enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell,
                    and buy for yourselves. And while they went to buy, the
                    bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with
                    him to the marriage: and the door was shut. Afterward came
                    also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. But he
                    answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not."
                       The presence of the Holy Spirit in the believer's heart is
                    crucial to the preparation to meet Jesus, just as the oil in the
                    lamp was crucial to being prepared to meet the bridegroom.
                    That oil of the Spirit must be obtained now. When the Bride-
                    groom comes, it will be too late.
                       "Now is the time to entreat that souls shall not only hear
                    the word of God, but without delay secure oil in their vessels
                    with their lamps. That oil is the righteousness of Christ. It
                    represents character, and character is not transferable. No
                    man can secure it for another. Each must obtain for himself
                    a character purified from every stain of sin."—Testimonies to
                    Ministers, pages 233, 234.
                       Note that the oil is both the Holy Spirit and the righteousness
                    of Christ. The Holy Spirit is the instrument to produce righ-
                    teousness, and the righteousness of Christ in the life is the
                    result of the Spirit's work.
                       "No man can impart to another the character which is the
                    fruit of the Spirit's working. 'Though Noah, Daniel, and Job
                    were in it [the land], as I live, saith the Lord God, they shall
                    deliver neither son nor daughter; they shall but deliver their
                    own souls by their righteousness.' "—Christ's Object Lessons,
                    page 412. (Emphasis supplied.)
 THINK IT THROUGH      What is the relationship between faith in Jesus and re-
                    ception of the Spirit?
                       "All the ten virgins appeared to be ready for the coming of
                    the bridegroom, and yet the test brought out the fact that five
                    were unready. Those who have true piety esteem and revere
                    the law of God. Through the grace of Christ they exemplify the
                    principles of the law in their lives, and will not wilfully break
                    any of the commandments of God. . . . They yield to Christ,
                    who leads men to repentance of sin, who pardons the penitent
                    soul, and clothes him with his own righteousness."—Review

             Part 3     "The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which
 AND THEY WOULD made a marriage for his son, and sent forth his servants to
                     call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would
         NOT COME not come."
 Matt. 22:2, 3, 8-10
                        "Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but
                     they which were bidden were not worthy. Go ye therefore
                     into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the
                     marriage. So those servants went out into the highways, and
                     gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and
                     good: and the wedding was furnished with guests."

                         This parable teaches that many refuse to accept the Lord's
                     invitation and that both "bad and good" are invited to be
                     present at the marriage.
                         Three invitations were sent out to call the guests to the
                     feast. See Matt. 22:3-9. The first was extended by the Twelve
                     and the Seventy to the Jewish people during the time of Christ's
                     ministry. The second was given by the disciples after the cru-
                     cifixion of Christ, making a further call to God's chosen people.
                     The third represents the preaching of the gospel to the Gentiles.
                     See Christ's Object Lessons, pages 308, 309.
                         "The nation that claimed to be God's peculiar people re-
                     jected the gospel brought to them in the power of the Holy
                     Spirit. Many did this in the most scornful manner. Others were
                     so exasperated by the offer of salvation, the offer of pardon
                     for rejecting the Lord of glory, that they turned upon the bearers
                     of the message. There was 'a great persecution.' Acts 8:1.
                     Many both of men and women were thrust into prison, and some
                     of the Lord's messengers, as Stephen and James, were put to
                     death."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 308.
 THINK IT THROUGH        What is my responsibility when I have accepted the invi-
                     tation to the gospel feast? (See Rev. 22:17.)

                         "The king's servants who went out into the highways 'gath-
                     ered together all as many as they found, both bad and good.'
                     It was a mixed company. Some of them had no more real re-
                     gard for the giver of the feast than had the ones who rejected
                     the call. The class first bidden could not afford, they thought,
                     to sacrifice any worldly advantage for the sake of attending
                     the king's banquet. And of those who accepted the invitation,
                     there were some who thought only of benefiting themselves.
                     They came to share the provisions of the feast, but had no
                     desire to honor the king."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 309.

                     saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having
         GARMENT     a wedding garment? And he was speechless. Then said the
    Matt. 22:1113    king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him
                     away, and cast him into outer darkness; there shall be weep-
                     ing and gnashing of teeth."


                         "For every guest at the feast there had been provided a
                     wedding garment. This garment was a gift from the king. By
                     wearing it the guests showed their respect for the giver of the
                     feast."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 309.
                         "By the wedding garment in the parable is represented the
                     pure, spotless character which Christ's true followers will
                     possess. To the church it is given 'that she should be arrayed
                     in fine linen, clean and white,' not having spot, or wrinkle, or
                     any such thing.' . . . It is the righteousness of Christ, His own
                     unblemished character, that through faith is imparted to all
                     who receive Him as their personal Saviour."—Christ's Object

                      fessed and unforsaken sin; it is a principle of life that trans-
                      forms the character and controls the conduct. Holiness is
                     wholeness for God; it is the entire surrender of heart and life
                     to the indwelling of the principles of heaven."—The Desire of

 THINK IT THROUGH       In personal experience, what is the significance of the
                     speechlessness of the man without a wedding garment?



                        "This robe, woven in the loom of heaven, has in it not one
                     thread of human devising. Christ in His humanity wrought out
                     a perfect character, and this character he offers to impart to
                     us. . . . By His perfect obedience He has made it possible for
                     every human being to obey God's commandments. When we
                     submit ourselves to Christ, the heart is united with His heart,
                     the will is merged in His will, the mind becomes one with His
                     mind, the thoughts are brought into captivity to Him; we live
                     His life. This is what it means to be clothed with the garment
                     of His righteousness. Then as the Lord looks upon us He sees,
                     not the fig-leaf garment, not the nakedness and deformity of
                     sin, but His own robe of righteousness, which is perfect obe-

              Part 5      From the information contained in the record of the vision
        JOSHUA AND     of Zechariah, what is the meaning of the change of raiment?
         THE ANGEL        "Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing be-
     Zech. 3:1.5 RSV   fore the angel of the Lord, and Satan standing at his right
                       hand to accuse him. And the Lord said to Satan, 'The Lord
                       rebuke you, 0 Satan! The Lord who has chosen Jerusalem
                       rebuke you! Is not this a brand plucked From the fire?' Now
                       Joshua was standing before the angel, clothed with filthy
                       garments. And the angel said to those who were standing
                       before him, 'Remove the filthy garments from him.' And to
                       him he said, 'Behold, I have taken your iniquity away from
                       you, and I will clothe you with rich apparel.' And I said, 'Let
                       them put a clean turban on his head.' So they put a clean
                       turban on his head and clothed him with garments; and the
                       angel of the Lord was standing by."
                           Read also verses 6-10.
                           This message from the prophet Zechariah presents a symbol
                       of Judah. Judah had sinned, had been led away into cap-
                       tivity, and now, under the favor of God, had returned to Pales-
                       tine.
                           "And now that this work of restoration had begun, and a
                       remnant of Israel had already returned to Judea, Satan was
                       determined to frustrate the carrying out of the divine purpose,
                       and to this end he was seeking to move upon the heathen na-
                       tions to destroy them utterly."—Prophets and Kings, page 583.
                           "It was by faith in the coming Saviour that Joshua and his
                       people had received pardon. Through faith in Christ they had
                       been restored to God's favor. By virtue of His merits, if they
                       walked in his ways and kept His statutes, they would be 'men
                       wondered at,' honored as the chosen of Heaven among the
                       nations of the earth."—Prophets and Kings, page 585.

 THINK IT THROUGH        "Zechariah's vision of Joshua and the Angel applies with
                       peculiar force to the experience of God's people in the closing

                          "Christ is our High Priest. Satan stands before Him night

           Part 6      In what sense must the spiritual qualities symbolized in
      COUNSEL TO     Rev. 3:18 be bought?
        LAODICEA        "I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that
         Rev. 3:18   thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be
                     clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear;
                     and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see."

                         Those who are invited to open the door of their hearts to
                     Jesus (Rev. 3:21), have also been invited to buy "gold," "white
                     raiment" and "eyesalve." What is the meaning of each of these
                     symbols?
                         "Let them humble their souls before God, let the grace of
                     God illuminate the darkness, and the scales will fall from their
                     eyes, and they will realize their true spiritual poverty and
                     wretchedness. They will feel the necessity of buying gold, which
                     is pure faith and love; white raiment, which is a spotless char-
                     acter made pure in the blood of their dear Redeemer; and
                     eyesalve, which is the grace of God and which will give clear
                     discernment of spiritual things and detect sin. These attain-
                     ments are more precious than the gold of Ophir."—Testimo-

                     itual understanding! Sin must be crucified. A complete moral
                     renovation must be wrought by the Holy Spirit. We must have
                      the love of God, with living, abiding faith. This is the gold tried
                     in the fire. We can obtain it only of Christ. Every sincere and
                     earnest seeker will become a partaker of the divine nature."

            Part 1      "And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all
  THE GOSPEL INTO    the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the
                     end come."
   ALL THE WORLD
       Matt. 24:14       Before Christ ascended into heaven He gave to His disciples
                     the great commission to go "into all the world, and preach the
                     gospel to every creature." Mark 16:15.
                          That little band of disciples, in the name of Christ, and in
                     the power of the Holy Spirit, in season and out of season, under
                     favorable and unfavorable conditions, preached the message
                     of a crucified and risen Saviour. See Desire of Ages, page 827.
                          Our text calls attention to God's plan that before the Sav-
                     iour's return, the gospel is to be preached to all the world.
                     Conditions in the world will provide a backdrop which will give
                     significance and relevance to the final preaching of the gospel.
                          "The present is a time of overwhelming interest to all living.
                     Rulers and statesmen, men who occupy positions of trust and
                     authority, thinking men and women of all classes, have their
                     attention fixed upon the events taking place about us. They are
                     watching the relations that exist among the nations. They ob-
                     serve the intensity that is taking possession of every earthly
                     element, and they recognize that something great and decisive
                     is about to take place—that the world is on the verge of a
                     stupendous crisis."—Prophets and Kings, page 537.
                          "Christ came to this world for no other purpose than to man-
                     ifest the glory of God, that man might be uplifted by its restor-
                     ing power. . . . He knew that the gospel of the kingdom would
                      be preached in all the world; that truth, armed with the omnip-
                     otence of the Holy Spirit, would conquer in the contest with
                     evil; and that the blood-stained banner would one day wave
                      triumphantly over His followers."—That I May Know Him, page
                     37.
 THINK IT THROUGH          What is "this gospel of the kingdom"? What am I doing
                     to proclaim it?
                         "The message of Christ's soon coming is designed to
                     arouse men from their absorption in worldly things. It is in-
                     tended to awaken them to a sense of eternal realities, that they
                     may give heed to the invitation to the Lord's table. . . .
                         "The world is perishing for want of the gospel. There is a
                     famine for the word of God. There are few who preach the
                     word unmixed with human:, tradition. Though men have the
                     Bible in their tands, theydo not receive the blessing that God
                     has placed in it-forithemr. The Lord calls upon His servants
                     to carry His message to the people. The word of everlasting
                     life must be given to those who are perishing in their sins."

             Part 2      "And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven,
       THE HOUR OF    having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell
                      on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue,
         JUDGMENT     and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give
        Rev. 14:6,1   glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and wor-
                      ship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the
                      fountains of waters."
                         "The messages of this chapter [Rev. 14] constitute a three-
                      fold warning ... which is to prepare the inhabitants of the earth
                      for the Lord's second coming. The announcement, 'The hour of
                      His judgment is come,' points to the closing work of Christ's
                      ministration for the salvation of men.... That men may be pre-
                      pared to stand in the judgment, the message commands them
                      to 'fear God, and give glory to Him,' and worship Him that
                      made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of
                      waters.' The result of an acceptance of these messages is
                      given in the word: 'Here are they that keep the commandments
                      of God, and the faith of Jesus.' In order to be prepared for the
                      judgment, it is necessary that men should keep the law of
                      God. That law will be the standard of character in the judg-
                      ment....
                          "The duty to worship God is based upon the fact that He is
                      the Creator and that to Him all other beings owe their existence.
                      And wherever, in the Bible, His claim to reverence and wor-
                      ship, above the gods of the heathen, is presented, there is cited
                      the evidence of His creative power." (Then follow Ps. 96:5;
                      Isa. 40:25, 26; 45:18; Pe. 100:3; 95:6; Rev. 4:11.)—The Great

THINK IT THROUGH         Which of the Ten Commandments calls attention to the
                      Creator? Would the keeping of this commandment have any-
                      thing to do with true worship of the Creator?
                          "In Revelation 14, men are called upon to worship the Crea-
                      tor; and the prophecy brings to view a class that, as the result
                      of the threefold message, are keeping the commandments of
                      God. . . . The fourth precept declares: "In six days the Lord
                      made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and
                      rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sab-
                      bath day, and hallowed it.' Ex. 20:11. ...
                          "So long as the fact that He is our Creator continues to be
                      a reason why we should worship Him, so long the Sabbath will
                      continue as its sign and memorial. Had the Sabbath been uni-
                      versally kept, man's thoughts and affections would have been
                      led to the Creator as the object of reverence and worship, and

     COME OUT OF fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations
                  drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication."
        BABYLON
        Rev. 14:8    "And after these things I saw another angel come down
       Rev. 18:14 from heaven, having great power; and the earth was light-
                    ened with his glory. And he cried mightily with a strong
                    voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is
                    become the habitation of devils. . . . For all nations have
                    drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication. . . . And
                    I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her,
                    my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye
                    receive not of her plagues."
                       "Babylon is fallen, 'because she made all nations drink of
                    the wine of the wrath of her fornication.' What is that wine?—
                    her false doctrines. She has given to the world a false sabbath
                    instead of the Sabbath of the fourth commandment, and has
                    repeated the falsehood that Satan first told to Eve in Eden
                    —the natural immortality of the soul. Many kindred errors she
                    has spread far and wide, 'teaching for doctrines the command-
                    ments of men.' ...
                       "And in the loud cry of the third angel's message a voice
                    is heard from heaven saying, 'come out of her, my people, that
                    ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her
                    plagues. For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath
                    remembered her iniquities.' "—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA
                    Bible Commentary, Vol. 7, p. 985.
                        What call did the apostle Paul give to the Corinthian be-

 THINK IT THROUGH      On what condition can I be a "son" or "daughter" of the
                    Lord Almighty? 2 Cor. 6:17, 18.

                         "Of Babylon, at the time brought to view in this prophecy,
                    it is declared: 'Her sins have reached unto heaven, and God
                    hath remembered her iniquities.' Rev. 18.5           But God still
                    has a people in Babylon; and before the visitation of His judg-
                    ments these faithful ones must be called out, that they partake
                    not of her sins and 'receive not of her plagues.' Hence the
                    movement symbolized by the angel coming down from heaven,
                    lightening the earth with his glory and crying mightily with a
                    strong voice, announcing the sins of Babylon. In connection
                    with his message the call is heard: 'Come out of her, My peo-
                     ple.' These announcements, uniting with the third angel's mes-
                     sage, constitute the final warning to be given to the inhabitants

The Third Angel's Message          LESSON 12                          ❑ Thursday
                                                                        March 21

             Part 5      The announcement of judgment led to the call to fear and
 UNITY OF THOUGHT     glorify God. A correct relation with God, fearing and glorifying
                      Him, results in readiness for the judgment. A close relation
IN THREE MESSAGES     exists between judgment and justification. Without a judgment
                      justification is unnecessary because justification accomplishes
                      removal of the sin that the judgment would condemn. But God
                      announced judgment, and if fear of God leads one to confess
                      his sins and accept Christ's righteousness, he will receive
                      acquittal in the judgment.
                         The angel calls also for man to glorify God. Man glorifies
                      God by living the character of God before his fellowmen, a
                      process also known as sanctification. This may also be viewed
                      as man doing what he can by God's help to develop a fitness
                      for heaven. God decides in the judgment on entrance of people
                      to heaven.
                          After the announcement of judgment the angel calls men
                      to worship God as Creator. Observance of the seventh-day
                      Sabbath corresponds to this call.
                         Of what is Sabbath observance a sign? Ex 31:13.

                         What sign indicates the fear of God? The commands to fear
                      and glorify God link together as a unit in verse 7. This har-
                      monizes with the inseparability of justification and sanctifica-
                      tion. The believer is justified so that he can be sanctified. If
                      he is being sanctified, then he must have been justified. Thus
                      true Sabbath keeping is a sign that the righteousness of Christ
                      is accomplishing its goal in the life of the believer.
                         Those who do not accept Christ's righteousness constitute
                      Babylon and are followers of the beast and his image. In the
                      second and third messages this group is shown to be under
                      the judgment of God because they have believed another mes-
                      sage than God's message and have worshipped another power
                      than God. The righteousness of Christ is the theme of the three
                      messages in the context of the judgment.

 THINK IT THROUGH        Why does a formal keeping of the Sabbath, just laying
                      aside our regular work and resting for 24 hours, fall short of
                      God's purpose in giving us the Sabbath?

                          "All power is given into His [Christ's] hands, that He may
                      dispense rich gifts unto men, imparting the priceless gift of
                      His own righteousness to the helpless human agent. This is
                      the message that God commanded to be given to the world.
                      It is the third angel's message, which is to be proclaimed with
                      a loud voice, and attended with the outpouring of His Spirit in
                      a large measure."—Testimonies to Ministers, page 92.

      THE OBEDIENCE     the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus."
            OF FAITH
                            The saints are acquitted in the judgment. They will have
           Rev. 14:12   chosen the faith of Jesus in preference to the wine of Babylon,
                        and obeyed God's commandments in preference to obeying
                        the beast and his image. The saints will have combined faith
                        and obedience, or Jesus and the law.
                            "Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to
                        my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the
                        revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the
                        world began, but now is made manifest, and by the scriptures
                        of the prophets, according to the commandment of the ever-
                        lasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of
                        faith: to God only wise, be glory through Jesus Christ for ever.
                        Amen." Rom. 16:25-27.
                            "Now, it has been Satan's determined purpose to eclipse
                        the view of Jesus and lead men to look to man, and trust to
                        man, and be educated to expect help from man. For years the
                        church has been looking to man, and expecting much from
                        man, but not looking to Jesus, in whom our hopes of eternal
                        life are centered. Therefore God gave to His servants a testi-
                        mony that presented the truth as it is in Jesus, which is the
                        third angel's message, in clear, distinct lines."—Testimonies
                        to Ministers, page 93.
                            "The message of the gospel of His grace was to be given to
                        the church in clear and distinct lines, that the world should no
                        longer say that Seventh-day Adventists talk the law, the law,

 THINK IT THROUGH         In what way has Abraham set an example for me in the
                        matter of obedience? See Heb. 11:8.

                            "The Lord God of heaven will not send upon the world His
                        judgments for disobedience and transgression until He has
                        sent His watchmen to give the warning. He will not close up the
                        period of probation until the message shall be more distinctly
                        proclaimed. The law of God is to be magnified; its claims must
                        be presented in their true, sacred character, that the people
                        may be brought to decide for or against the truth. Yet the
                        work will be cut short in righteousness. The message of Christ's
                        righteousness is to sound from one end of the earth to the
                        other to prepare the way of the Lord. This is the glory of God,
                        which closes the work of the third angel."—Testimonies, Vol.

                     must be expelled from the abodes of bliss, then the rebel

                     reiterated his claim that angels needed no control, but should
                     be left to follow their own will, which would ever guide them
                     right. He denounced the divine statutes as a restriction of their

           Part 2      "The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his
    GOD'S LAW IS    commandments are sure. They stand fast for ever and ever
                    and are done in truth and uprightness. He sent redemption
     IMMUTABLE      unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever:
      Ps. 111:1-9   holy and reverend is his name."

                         "The law of God, being a revelation of His will, a transcript
                    of His charatcer, must forever endure, 'as a faithful witness in
                    heaven.' Not one command has been annulled; not a jot or
                    tittle has been changed. Says the psalmist: 'Forever, 0 Lord,
                    Thy word is settled in heaven.' All His commandments are
                    sure. They stand fast for ever and ever.' Ps. 119:89; 111:7, 8."
                    —The Great Controversy, page 434.

                      What was one of Christ's purposes in coming to this world?
                    Matt. 5:17, 18.

                       How did Christ demonstrate His attitude toward the Law
                    of God? John 15:10 (last part), John 8:46 (first part).

                       How is faith in Christ related to the law of God? Rom. 3:31.

                        "He [Jesus] gave his life as a sacrifice, not to destroy God's
                    law, not to create a lower standard, but that justice might be
                    maintained, that the law might be shown to be immutable, that
                    it might stand fast forever."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 314.

 THINK IT THROUGH      How can I show by my daily living that the law of God is
                    valid?

                       "Had it been possible for the law to be changed or abro-
                    gated, then Christ need not have died. But to abrogate the law
                    would be to immortalize transgression, and place the world
                    under Satan's control. It was because the law was changeless,
                    because man could be saved only through obedience to its
                    precepts, that Jesus was lifted up on the cross. Yet the very
                    means by which Christ established the law Satan represented
                    as destroying it. Here will come the last conflict of the great
                    controversy between Christ and Satan.
                       "That the law which was spoken by God's own voice is
                    faulty, that some specification has been set aside, is the claim
                    which Satan now puts forward. It is the last great deception
                    that he will bring upon the world."—The Desire of Ages, pages

   FINAL CONFLICT     that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number
     Rev. 13:16, 11   of his name."

                          To what extreme will Satan go to bring all under his form
                      of government? Rev. 13:15.

                         The power depicted in Revelation 13 will do its utmost to
                      bring about conformity to the mark of its authority. First boy-
                      cott and then a death decree will be leveled against those who
                      seek to uphold the sanctity of the Ten Commandments.
                         "As the claims of the fourth commandment are urged upon
                      the people, it is found that the observance of the seventh-day
                      Sabbath is enjoined; and as the only way to free themselves
                      from a duty which they are unwilling to perform, many popular
                      teachers declare that the law of God is no longer binding. Thus
                      they cast away the law and the Sabbath together... .
                         "Yet this very class put forth the claim that the fast-spread-
                      ing corruption is largely attributable to the desecration of the
                      so-called 'Christian Sabbath,' and that the enforcement of
                      Sunday observance would greatly improve the morals of so-
                      ciety."—The Great Controversy, page 587.

 THINK IT THROUGH        What is my greatest need so that Jesus may carry me
                      safely through the final crisis?

                          "He [Satan] will bring disease and disaster, until populous
                      cities are reduced to ruin and desolation. Even now he is at
                      work. In accidents and calamities by sea and by land, in great
                      conflagrations, in fierce tornadoes and terrific hailstorms, in
                      tempests, floods, cyclones, tidal waves, and earthquakes, in
                      every place and in a thousand forms, Satan is exercising his
                      power. He sweeps away the ripening harvest, and famine and
                      distress follow. He imparts to the air a deadly taint, and thou-
                      sands perish by the pestilence. These visitations are to be-
                      come more and more frequent and disastrous. . . .
                          "And then the great deceiver will persuade men that those
                      who serve God are causing these evils. The class that have
                      provoked the displeasure of Heaven will charge all their trou-
                      bles upon those whose obedience to God's commandments is
                      a perpetual reproof to transgressors. It will be declared that
                      men are offending God by the violation of the Sunday sabbath;
                      that this sin has brought calamities which will not cease until
                      Sunday observance shall be strictly enforced."—The Great

                   be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a

                       Study the promises of God in Psalm 91:1, 2, 7, 8, 14, 15.
                       "When the third angel's message closes, mercy no longer
                    pleads for the guilty inhabitants of the earth. The people of
                    God have accomplished their work. They have received 'the
                    latter rain,' the refreshing from the presence of the Lord,' and
                    they are prepared for the trying hour before them.... The final
                    test has been brought upon the world, and all who have proved
                    themselves loyal to the divine precepts have received 'the seal
                    of the living God.' Then Jesus ceases his intercession in the
                    sanctuary above....
                        "When He leaves the sanctuary, darkness covers the inhabi-
                    tants of the earth. In that fearful time the righteous must live
                    in the sight of a holy God without an intercessor."—The Great

                        "As Satan influenced Esau to march against Jacob, so he
                    will stir up the wicked to destroy God's people in the time of

                    severely tested."—The Great Controversy, page 618.
 THINK IT THROUGH      "It is often the case that trouble is greater in anticipation
                    than in reality; but this is not true of the crisis before us. The
                    most vivid presentation cannot reach the magnitude of the
                    ordeal. In that time of trial, every soul must stand for himself
                    before God."—"The Great Controversy," page 622.

                       "They [God's people] afflict their souls before God, point-
                    ing to their past repentance of their many sins, . . They lay
                    hold of the strength of God as Jacob laid hold of the Angel;
                    and the language of their souls is: 'I will not let Thee go, ex-
                    cept Thou bless me.'
                       "Had not Jacob previously repented of his sin in obtaining
                    the birthright by fraud, God would not have heard his prayer
                    and mercifully preserved his life. So, in the time of trouble, if
                    the people of God had unconfessed sins to appear before them
                    while tortured with fear and anguish, they would be over-
                    whelmed.. . . But while they have a deep sense of their un-
                    worthiness, they have no concealed wrongs to reveal. Their
                    sins have gone beforehand to judgment and have been blotted

           Part 5      In view of the "day of the Lord" what four commands
             SEEK    were given to Judah in the following passage?
  RIGHTEOUSNESS         "Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together, 0 na-
       Zeph. 2:1.3   tion not desired; before the decree bring forth, before the
                     day pass as the chaff, before the fierce anger of the Lord
                     come upon you, before the day of the Lord's anger come upon
                     you. Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth, which have
                     wrought his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it
                     may be ye shall be hid in the day of the Lord's anger."

                        "During the reign of Josiah the word of the Lord came to
                     Zephaniah, specifying plainly the results of continued apos-
                     tasy, and calling the attention of the true church to the glorious
                     prospect beyond. His prophecies of impending judgment upon
                     Judah apply with equal force to the judgments that are to fall
                     upon an impenitent world at the time of the second advent of
                     Christ."—Prophets and Kings, page 389.

                     for us, we should seek to become perfect in Christ. . . .
                         "It is in this life that we are to separate sin from us, through
                     faith in the atoning blood of Christ."—The Great Controversy,

                        What is Christ waiting to accomplish in His church before
                     receiving it unto Himself? Eph. 5:26, 27.

                     and His love, are to appear in full and final display. Christ
                     looks upon His people in their purity and perfection, as the
                     reward of His humiliation, and the supplement of His glory,—

                        "Christ is waiting with longing desire for the manifestation
                     of Himself in His church. When the character of Christ shall

       OF CHRIST'S        "He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is
   RIGHTEOUSNESS      filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him
     Rev. 22:11, 12   be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.
                      And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to
                      give every man according as his work shall be."
                          Read Revelation 15:2, 3.
                          As probation closes and the final decree goes forth, a seal
                      is placed on the righteous. But their righteousness is not their
                      own. It is the righteousness of Christ that has been imputed and
                      imparted to them. They have made it their own. Through faith
                      in Him they have been able to stand firm unto the end. They
                      will not take any credit to themselves, but they will say, "Bless-

                      of Christ shall cease in the sanctuary above are to stand in
                      the sight of a holy God without a mediator. Their robes must
                      be spotless their characters must be purified from sin by the
                       blood of sprinkling. Through the grace of God and their own
                       diligent effort they must be conquerors in the battle with evil."
