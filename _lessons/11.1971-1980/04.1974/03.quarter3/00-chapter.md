           THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING OVERFLOW

          September 28, 1974—South American Division

   Adventist pioneers began work in Brazil in 1891. That work has
grown until today we have 184,287 members united in the blessed hope.
   Part of this remarkable growth we owe to Brazil College, which for
almost 60 years has been preparing workers for evangelistic endeavors.
However, this institution urgently needs quarters for the theology depart-
ment. Fifty percent of the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering overflow for this
quarter will be applied toward this project.
    The Amazonas Agricultural School, located in the heart of the
Amazon jungle, will benefit from the other half of this offering. This
dense green jungle, until recently largely untouched by man, is now be-
ing rapidly penetrated and settled.
   We believe that the Amazonas Agricultural School can play an im-
portant role in illuminating the Amazon with the light of the Adventist
hope.
   We request you, the members of the Sabbath School, to contribute
generously on Sabbath, September 28, for these two institutions that so
much need your financial support.
                                     Enoch de Oliveira, Secretary

                               THE COVER
    The hourglass, oft-used symbol of the passage of time, here repre-
sents the message of the second half of Revelation, which points to the
last time—the end. These prophecies reveal that most of the time of
man's rule in this world is past. The time of Christ's rulership approaches.
    The user of an hourglass knows the precise time required for the
sand to flow through the aperture. But in relation to the time of the com-
ing of Jesus there is no such precision after 1844. Time is short. But
we have tipped the hourglass by our unpreparedness for His return, so
that the passage of the last grains of sand has been delayed. Shall we
get the sand flowing again?
                      NEWS FROM JESUS-2
                          GENERAL INTRODUCTION

    The Revelation was written not for the casual reader but for the one who loves
his Bible and earnestly seeks to know the truth as it is in Jesus.
    The angel said to John: "Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the
words of this prophecy." Rev. 1:3. Many years ago Ellen G. White issued this
challenge to the Adventist Church: "Great truths that have lain unheeded and
unseen since the day of Pentecost, are to shine from God's word in their native
purity. To those who truly love God the Holy Spirit will reveal truths that have
faded from the mind, and will also reveal truths that are entirely new."—Funda-
mentals of Christian Education, page 473.
    In 1888 Ellen White wrote: "Increased light will shine upon all the grand
truths of prophecy, and they will be seen in freshness and brilliancy, because
the bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness will illuminate the whole."—Evan-
gelism, page 198.
    It is evident that even Seventh-day Adventists did not have all the light on
prophecy at the time these words were written. Increased light is never the result
of indolence. Jesus said: "Seek, and ye shall find." The book of Revelation is
different from every other book in the New Testament. If we think of the Sermon
on the Mount as the primer of the church, and the Acts of the Apostles as the
geography of the church, and the epistles as the ethics of the church, then the
Revelation could well be the philosophy of history of the church.
    While it is a revelation of Jesus Christ, it is also a book of music. Seven
anthems are recorded in these chapters. Through these we can catch the echo of
the celestial choirs. Forty-six times John records hearing voices, and often they
are voices of victory. On occasions devils also are referred to, but they are all
silent. No song is awakened in Revelation by evil passions. Jesus sang knowing
He was facing crucifixion. Paul and Silas sang in the dark dungeon with their feet
in the stocks. The church has always sung her way through trials to triumph.
Thank God for the Christian message that sets the people singing. Hymns, psalms,
anthems, and oratorios have marked the history of God's people through the
centuries.
     During this second series of lessons on the Revelation we will study some of
the most graphic portions of the book. Prophecies of great import will challenge
our thinking—prophecies which we as Adventists need to understand in order to
 share faith and give a reason for the hope that is within us with meekness and
 fear. It was largely the study of the Revelation that brought the advent movement
 into being. Let us pray that the restudy of these great themes will prepare the
 church for the latter rain. In this connection Ellen G. White has said: "When we
 as a people understand what this book [Revelation] means to us, there will be
 seen among us a great revival."—Testimonies to Ministers, page 113. And again:
 "When the books of Daniel and Revelation are better understood, believers will
 have an entirely different religious experience."—Testimonies to Ministers, page
114. These statements should challenge us to study this great book with a new
 diligence, seeking ever to know the truth as it is in Jesus.

              The Blessing of Daily Study
       "Every day some portion of time should be appropri-
    ated to the study of the lessons, not merely in learning to
    mechanically repeat the words, while the mind does not
    comprehend the meaning; but to go to the very founda-
    tion, and become familiar with what is brought out in the
    lesson."—"Counsels on Sabbath School Work," page 53.




                            My Pledge
       As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge
    of the Scriptures, I pledge myself to the careful and
    prayerful study of some portion of my Sabbath School
    lesson each day of the week.

   "And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and
strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the
accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God clay
and night. And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the
word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death." Rev.
12:10, 11.




war against the
   "Satan had warred for the mastery in heaven, and had lost the battle. God
could no longer trust him with honor and supremacy, and these, with the part
he had taken in the government of heaven, were taken from him.
   "Since that time Satan and his army of confederates have been the avowed
enemies of God in our world, continually warring against the cause of truth and
righteousness. Satan has continued to present to men, as he presented to the
angels, his false representations of Christ and of God, and he has won the
world to his side. Even the professedly Christian churches have taken sides
with the first great apostate. . . .
   "The influence of mind on mind, so strong a power for good when sanctified,
is equally strong for evil in the hands of those opposed to God. This power
Satan used in his work of instilling evil into the minds of the angels, and he
made it appear that he was seeking the good of the universe. . . .
   "The casting down of Satan as an accuser of the brethren in heaven was
accomplished by the great work of Christ in giving up His life. Notwithstanding
Satan's persistent opposition, the plan of redemption was being carried out.
Man was esteemed of sufficient value for Christ to sacrifice His life for him.
Satan, knowing that the empire he had usurped would in the end be wrested
from him, determined to spare no pains to destroy as many as possible of the
creatures whom God had created in His image. . . .
   "The victory gained at His death on Calvary broke forever the accusing
power of Satan over the universe, and silenced his charges that self-denial
was impossible with God and therefore not essential in the human family."
—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 7, pp. 973, 974.

              Part 1      "And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman
         THE WOMAN     clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon
                       her head a crown of twelve stars: and she being with child
                       cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered." Rev.
                       12:1, 2.

                          It will help our understanding of Revelation 12 if we think
                       of it as a prophetic drama in four parts:
                          1. The origin of sin when Lucifer challenged God and His
                              throne.
                          2. The attack on Christ.
                          3. The persecution of the church in an attempt to destroy it.
                          4. The final war on God's remnant people.
                          What symbolic meaning did writers of both Old and New
                       Testaments give to a woman in prophecy? Jer. 6:2; Isa. 54:5,
                       6; Hosea 2:19, 20; 2 Cor. 11:2; Rev. 19:7, 8.

                          How have the Bible writers represented the corrupt or
                       apostate church? Isa. 50:1; Jer. 3:1, 8; Ezek. 16:26-29; Rev.
                       17:1-5.

                            A woman in prophecy represents a church. With the sun for
                       her garment and the moon as her footstool the woman is a
                       fitting representation of God's people, the church. The true
                       people of God are pictured as being clothed with the "Sun of
                       righteousness." Mal. 4:2. The church of both the Old and the
                       New Testaments was established on the sure foundation of
                       the Word of God. Thus the sun represents Christ's righteous-
                       ness, and the moon represents the Word of God.
                           The twelve stars in the crown of the woman or the true
                       church could well represent the twelve tribes of Israel, as she
                       is shown in the prophecy previous to the birth of Jesus and
                       thus before the founding of the Christian church.

                          In what state was the woman or the church when John saw
                       her? Verse 2.

                          Throughout all the centuries since God made the promise
                       to Eve, His true people were awaiting the coming of the Re-
                       deemer. But it was in "the fulness of the time" that God sent
                       forth His Son. Gal. 4:4. When He came He was a helpless Babe
                       laid in the slender arms of a maiden. "Great is the mystery of
                       godliness: God was manifest in the flesh." 1 Tim. 3:16.
    THINK IT THROUGH      How can I better understand the condescension of the Son
                       of God to come into this world for my salvation?

                                                                             July 1

            Part 2      "And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and be-
      THE DRAGON     hold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns,
                     and seven crowns upon his heads." Rev. 12:3.

                        What power was waiting to destroy the child?

                        Who was this dragon power? Verse 9.

                        The devil has always sought to work through earthly powers.
                     Both ancient Egypt and pagan Rome took the dragon as their
                     symbol of power. This prophecy unmasks the devil, showing
                     him to be the author of all opposition to God by earthly powers
                     such as Babylon, Tyre, Rome, and even some modern nations.
                         Under what circumstances do we find God's first promise
                     of the coming Deliverer? Gen. 3:15.

                        This general promie was narrowed down from time to
                     time. It came to Abraham; then to Isaac; then to Jacob; then
                     to the tribe of Judah; next to David and his family; et cetera.
                     On each of these delegations we find the devil concentrating
                     his powers to thwart the plan of God. Yet in spite of all the
                     enemy's plots and schemes, God's promise was at last fulfilled.
                       In what significant way does the New Testament begin?
                     Matt. 1:1.

                        The child, Jesus, was born at last a member of the human
                     race in spite of all the united powers of opposition. Then from
                     His earliest years through to manhood our Lord was the object
                     of demonic hate. Satan at last succeeded in having Him cruci-
                     fied. And His grave was sealed by the Roman seal. But that
                     sealed rock-hewn sepulcher could not hold the Prince of life.
                     He strode forth the Conqueror, having raided the realm of
                     demonism and shattered the forces of darkness.
                       Where next do we find the "child" our Saviour? Rev. 12:5.
                     See also Eph. 1:20, 21.

                        He arose for our justification, and as King of righteousness
                     He now ministers at the throne of grace. Heb. 4:14; 8:1; 10:12.
                     Who can bring any accusation against the elect of God? As
                     we are justified in Christ and vindicated by His power, nothing
                     now can separate us from the love of God which is in Christ
                     Jesus. Rom. 8:38, 39.

                                                                               July 2

             Part 3      "And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels
           THE WAR    fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his
                      angels, and prevailed not; neither was their place found any
                      more in heaven." Rev. 12:7, 8.

                          This is a wonderfully revealing scripture. While other proph-
                      ets touch the great question of the origin of evil, these brief
                      verses make the issue very clear. War did not begin on earth;
                      it began in heaven. Lucifer instigated rebellion among the
                      angels as he challenged the rulership of God.
                         How does Isaiah unfold the mystery of sin? Isa. 14:12-15.

                         What added touch does Ezekiel give? Ezek. 28:12, 15.

                         Note that Lucifer is presented to us in these two scriptures
                      under the symbolic role of the king of Babylon in Isaiah and
                      then as the king of Tyrus in Ezekiel. An unseen power "work-
                      eth in the children of disobedience." Eph. 2:2.

                        How many angels or "the stars of heaven" joined with
                      Lucifer in the rebellion? Rev. 12:4.

                         How did God deal with these rebel hosts? 2 Peter 2:4.

                         Where are these fallen angels now? Jude 6.

                         They are under judgment awaiting the execution of their
                      sentence of judgment when they, along with all unrepentant
                      sinners, will be destroyed forever. Matt. 25:41; Rev. 20:10, 14.
                         It was a tragic day when the serpent won the allegiance of
                      Adam and Eve. This newly created earth then became the
                      battleground of contending forces led by two great generals,
                      Michael and the dragon.
                         Sin is a mystery. To excuse it is to defend it. There is no
                      place for sin in a perfect universe. Like a diseased portion of
                      a human body it must be removed in order for the body to exist
                      and be healthy. Evil will eventually be destroyed. Concerning
                      Satan the Lord has said: "Never shalt thou be any more."
                      Ezek. 28:19.

 THINK IT THROUGH        Do I understand the subtlety of Satan in his multitudinous
                      deceptions? Am I wholly on God's side in the contest with
                      evil? What is the Lord's promise to those victorious over sin?

                         "To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my

           Part 4      "And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come
     THE VICTORY    salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and
                    the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast
                    down, which accused them before our God day and night."
                    Rev. 12:10.
                        "The great contest that had been so long in progress in
                    this world was now decided, and Christ was conqueror. His
                    death had answered the question whether the Father and the
                    Son had sufficient love for man to exercise self-denial and a
                    spirit of sacrifice. Satan had revealed his true character as a
                    liar and a murderer. It was seen that the very same spirit with
                    which he had ruled the children of men who were under his
                    power, he would have manifested if permitted to control the
                    intelligences of heaven. With one voice the loyal universe united
                    in extolling the divine administration."—Patriarchs and Proph-
                    ets, page 70.
                       Why does the devil attack the church with such great
                    wrath? Rev. 12:12 (last part).
                       Christ's victory at Calvary settled the destiny not only of
                    our world but also of Satan and all his evil hosts. In The Desire
                    of Ages, page 758, we read: "All heaven triumphed in the
                    Saviour's victory. Satan was defeated, and knew that his king-
                    dom was lost....
                       "Not until the death of Christ was the character of Satan
                    clearly revealed to the angels or the unfallen worlds. The
                    archapostate has so clothed himself with deception that even
                    holy beings had not understood his principles."
                       What warning is issued to the inhabitants of the earth?
                    Verse 12.
                       The blood of the Lamb is the secret of the Christian's vic-
                    tory. But with the Christian's belief in the blood must also be
                    "the word of their testimony." To believe in the vicarious atone-
                    ment of our Lord is primary. But it must be accompanied by
                    our testimony to its reality in our lives.

 THINK IT THROUGH     In what ways must my life change in order to take full
                    advantage of the means of victory God has provided?
                       "All who will can be overcomers. Let us strive earnestly
                    to reach the standard set before us. Christ knows our weak-
                    ness, and to Him we can go daily for help. It is not necessary
                    for us to gain strength a month ahead. We are to conquer from

              Part 5      Against whom did the devil fight when he no longer had
     THE WILDERNESS    access to Jesus?

                          "And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the
                       earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man
                       child." Rev. 12:13.

                          What was given to the woman. and why? Verse 14.

                          "The eagles' wings given her appropriately signify the haste
                       with which the true church was obliged to seek her own safety
                       when the man of sin was installed in power. The assistance of
                       God was provided her to this end. The like figure is used to
                       describe God's dealings with ancient Israel. By Moses He said
                       to them, 'Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how
                       I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto Myself.'

                       558.
                          How long was the church to be "nourished" and pro-
                       tected? Verses 6, 14.

                          This period of 1,260 days, or "time, and times, and half a
                       time," we have already noted in chapter 11:3. In verse 2
                       (chapter 11) another calculation is used—"forty and two
                       months."
                          What does water represent in prophecy? Rev. 17:15; Isa.
                       8:7.

                          What "helped the woman" or the church? Rev. 12:16.

                          During the 1,260 years when true Christians faced death
                       for their faith, God's faithful people fled to places of refuge
                       such as the Piedmont valleys in Italy and the Alpine fastnesses.
                       The new land of America also opened its arms in welcome
                       for those who made their way across the ocean to escape
                       persecution.
                          The 1,260-year period which began in A.D. 538 reached to
                       1798. But in our Lord's great prophecy in Matt. 24:22 Jesus
                       said, "those days should be shortened." See also Mark 13:20.
                       And they were shortened. It is claimed that the last decree of
                       tolerance was passed in Austria in 1775, a few years prior to
                       1798, the end of the 1,260 years.

War Against the Woman LESSON 1                                           ❑ Friday
                                                                            July 5

          Part 6       With whom did the dragon make war?
    THE REMNANT
                       "And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to
                    make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the
                    commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus
                    Christ." Rev. 12:17.

                        Since Jesus was born of the woman, then the remnant of
                    her seed are the "brothers" and "sisters" of Jesus. By attack-
                    ing Jesus' "family," the devil attacks Jesus. Those who remain
                    faithful to their relation to Jesus are designated as the remnant.
                    It is in the light of the use of "remnant" in other scriptures
                    that we must understand the expression in Revelation 12:17.

                        What promise did King Hezekiah make on God's behalf
                    if the people would turn back to God? 2 Chron. 30:6.

                       Those who had escaped from Assyrian captivity he called
                    a "remnant." The word in Hebrew means "those who escape,"
                    "what remains," or "what is left."
                       What are the characteristics of the remnant? Rev. 12:17.

                       "The last great conflict between truth and error is but the
                    final struggle of the long-standing controversy concerning the
                    law of God."—The Great Controversy, page 582.
                       "Since it is the distinctive work of the prophets to bear
                    messages from Jesus to the people . . . , the interpretation
                    that the testimony of Jesus refers to the `testimony,' or `wit-
                    ness,' that Jesus bears to the church is strongly_ supported.
                    Seventh-day Adventists thus interpret the passage and believe
                    that the `remnant' will be distinguished by the manifesta-
                    tion of the gift of prophecy in their midst. The `testimony of
                    Jesus Christ,' they believe, is the witness of Jesus in their
                    midst through the medium of the prophetic gift."—SDA Bible
                    Commentary, on Rev. 12:17.
                       This gift of prophecy Seventh-day Adventists affirm has
                    been clearly manifested in the ministry and writings of Ellen
                    G. White. She was active as God's messenger among us from
                    1844 to 1915, when she passed to her rest. Throughout her long
                    and intensely active life she gave continual evidence of her
                    divine call.
 THINK IT THROUGH      How shall I become more aware of the divine blessings
                    given to God's remnant in the writings of the spirit of proph-
                    ecy? Am I bringing my life into harmony with the counsels
                    of His Spirit?

    the Beast
and the Lamb
  "And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are
not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the
world." Rev. 13:8.

    In chapters 12 to 22 we have, in a special way, God's final message of warn-
ing and entreaty to the world. Instead of religion being the bread of life, today
it has become the cake of life, a dainty dessert at the end of a full meal of
pleasure, business, or discussion. Even among those who digress enough to
speak a little about religion, the Bible is, too often, not regarded as the authen-
tic Word of God.
    To meet the need of this tragic time God inspired John to write the Revela-
tion of Jesus Christ. It is God's message to our time. In these chapters Christ
crucified, risen, ministering, and coming again is set forth in verity. The im-
 pressive prophetic symbols in this book make more plain the everlasting gospel.
As we continue to study this illuminating book let us remember that it is a
message straight from the Lord Jesus Himself.

              Part 1      "And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast
     DANIEL'S BEAST    rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and
                       upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of
         REAPPEARS     blasphemy. And the beast which I saw was like unto a leo-
                       pard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth
                       as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power,
                       and his seat, and great authority." Rev. 13:1, 2.
                          Six centuries before John's day the prophet Daniel recorded
                       a vision in which he saw a great ten-horned beast "dreadful
                       and terrible, and strong exceedingly." Dan. 7:7.
                          While Daniel was an important officer of state in Babylon,
                       he was given this vision. These beasts represented successive
                       empires: the lion, Babylon; the bear, Persia; the leopard,
                       Greece; and the ten-horned beast, Rome. The beast John saw
                       combined all the creatures of Daniel's vision—the lion, the
                       bear, the leopard and the ten-horned beast.
                          Which of the four beasts of Daniel did this seven-headed
                       beast most resemble? Rev. 13:2.
                          Although this beast symbolized pagan Rome, yet Greek cul-
                       ture and philosophy predominated in the Roman Empire to
                       such an extent that we often speak of the Greco-Roman Em-
                       pire. Hence the expression, "like a leopard" for the leopard
                       symbolized Greece. But the cultures of Babylon and Persia
                       also formed a part of the Empire.
                          What part of the seven-headed beast particularly resem-
                       bled ancient Babylon?
                          History records that when Rome spoke it was with the same
                       intolerant voice as that of Nebuchadnezzar when he ordered
                       the three Hebrews into the fiery furnace.
 THINK IT THROUGH         How would these great symbolic messages have affected
                       me had I been a member of one of the churches which re-
                       ceived the Revelation in John's day?
                           "In the revelation given to him [John] there was unfolded
                       scene after scene of thrilling interest in the experience of the
                       people of God, and the history of the church foretold to the
                       very close of time. In figures and symbols, subjects of vast
                       importance were presented to John, which he was to record,
                       that the people of God living in his age and in future ages
                       might have an intelligent understanding of the perils and con-
                       flicts before them.
                           "This revelation was given for the guidance and comfort

The Beast and the Lamb LESSON 2                                          ❑ Monday
                                                                            July 8

             Part 2      "And the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and
THE BEAST'S POWER     great authority." Rev. 13:2.

                         Who is the dragon that gives power and authority to the
                      seven-headed beast? Rev. 12:9.

                         We are not left to guess concerning the identity of the
                      dragon. He is called "the Devil and Satan." In verse 4 the
                      great red dragon is pictured as waiting to devour the Child
                      as soon as He was born. This anti-God power always works
                      through earthly kingdoms in his attempts to thwart the purposes
                      of God. It was pagan Rome that sought the destruction of the
                      infant Jesus.
                         Besides "power" and "authority" what else did the dragon
                      give the beast? Rev. 13:2.

                         The word "seat" in the Greek is thronos, from which we get
                      our word throne.
                         In addition to being a political kingdom what else does
                      prophecy say this blasphemous power demands? Verse 4.

                        Notice the wording of this text. When men pay this power
                      homage they actually worship the dragon, or the devil.

                         What are the similarities between the ten-horned beast
                      of Daniel and the seven-headed beast of Revelation? Dan.
                      7:7-14, 23-27; Rev. 13:1-10.

                         The purpose of this prophecy is to alert the people of God
                      to the dangers facing them, especially at the end of time. Per-
                      secuting powers have come and gone in past centuries, but
                      what God's remnant people face just before Christ comes is
                      more subtle, more deceptive than has ever been faced before.
 THINK IT THROUGH       Do I have a faith strong enough to meet the greatest
                      deceptions and the most overwhelming demonstrations of
                      power?

                         "A day of great intellectual darkness has been shown to
                      be favorable to the success of the papacy. It will yet be dem-
                      onstrated that a day of great intellectual light is equally favor-
                      able for its success. In past ages, when men were without
                      God's word and without the knowledge of the truth, their eyes
                      were blindfolded. . . . In this generation there are many whose
                      eyes become dazzled by the glare of human speculations,
                      'science falsely so called.' "—The Great Controversy, pages

The Beast and the Lamb LESSON 2                                         ❑   Tuesday
                                                                              July 9

           Part 3       "And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death;
THE WOUNDED HEAD     and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world won-
                     dered after the beast." Rev. 13:3.

                         The identity of this wounded head as the papacy is clear.
                     The papacy grew over a period of two hundred years, from
                     Constantine to Justinian. A decree by Justinian in A.D. 538
                     made the bishop of Rome "the head of the churches and the
                     corrector of heretics." It was not sudden but a gradual trans-
                     ference of power. The church historian Eusebius, in his Life
                     of Constantine states: "In order to render Christianity more
                     attractive to the Gentiles, the priests adopted the exterior
                     vestments and ornaments used in the pagan cult." Truth was
                     tragically sacrificed on the altars of form and liturgy. The rule
                     of the popes increased until it became almost absolute. Papal
                     control continued for many centuries. But it was destined for
                     defeat.
                        What did John see happening to bring an end to this domi-
                     nating power? Verse 3 (first part).

                         The beast of Revelation 13 received a "wound of death"
                     (literal translation of the Greek). But he recovered from the
                     wound. Even more remarkable than the wounding was the
                     healing. Every previous world power, after its wounding, re-
                     mained dead, or at least played no further role as a world
                     leader. But this power was different.
                        What effect will the papacy have on the world when its
                     recovery is complete? Verse 3 (last part), 4.

                        A similar statement of astonishment by the people of the
                     world is found in Revelation 17:8. The full recovery of this
                     wounded power is made possible because of the changed
                     attitude on the part of the peoples of the world. Liberty is the
                     watchword today. Under the slogan of liberty subtle influences
                     are shaping the future.
 THINK IT THROUGH        Do I recognize the widespread plans of certain groups to
                     enforce their ideas upon me? Will I personally be prepared
                     to face the crisis when it comes?

                        "There are only two parties upon this earth—those who
                     stand under the bloodstained banner of Jesus Christ and those
                     who stand under the black banner of rebellion."—Ellen G.

The Beast and the Lamb LESSON 2                                     ❑ Wednesday
                                                                         July 10

          Part 4       "And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great
      BLASPHEMY     things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to
                    continue forty and two months. And he opened his mouth in
                    blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tab-
                    ernacle, and them that dwell in heaven. And it was given
                    unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them:
                    and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and
                    nations." Rev. 13:5-7.

                       The power here mentioned is easily identified. It is the same
                    power already mentioned in chapters 11 and 12—the power
                    that was to continue forty-two months or 1,260 prophetic days.
                       When the beast opened his mouth, what does the prophecy
                    say he did? Verse 6.

                        Blasphemy in the Scriptural definition is not bad language;
                    it is claiming to be God. When Jesus was being tried before
                    the Jewish court, He was charged with blasphemy.
                       In addition to blaspheming God's name, what does the
                    prophecy say he will do? Verse 6.

                        To blaspheme God's tabernacle means that this power
                    would claim to do just what Christ, our High Priest, is doing
                    in the heavenly sanctuary. And that the apostate church does.
                    She claims to forgive sins. When Jesus forgave sins, the Phari-
                    sees called it blasphemy. See Luke 5:21.
                       What else does the prophecy say this power would do?
                    Verse 7.
                       Making war against God's people and overcoming them has
                    marked the history of this power. The terrible persecutions of
                    the centuries are responsible for the lives of millions of men
                    and women. The angel told Daniel this power would "wear out
                    the saints of the most High." Dan. 7:25.
 THINK IT THROUGH      How would I react if it were demanded of me that I
                    either give up my faith or give up my life? Those terrible
                    days of the past could well happen again.

                       "The same spirit that in ages past led men to persecute the
                    true church, will in the future lead to the pursuance of a similar
                    course toward those who maintain their loyalty to God. Even
                    now preparations are being made for this last great conflict."

The Beast and the Lamb LESSON 2                                           ❑ Thursday
                                                                              July 11

               Part 5      "And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him,
     THE BOOK OF LIFE   whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb
                        slain from the foundation of the world." Rev. 13:8.

                           The expression, "the book of life" is found seven times in
                        the Revelation, and each reference occurs in a very solemn
                        setting (see Rev. 3:5; 13:8; 17:8; 20:12, 15; 21:27; 22:19). Jesus
                        told the Seventy, whom He had sent out to preach and to
                        heal, that to know their names were "written in heaven" called
                        for greater rejoicing than that the devils were subject unto
                        them. Luke 10:19, 20.

                           How is the true church described in the Epistle to the He-
                        brews? Heb. 12:23.

                            The Revised Standard Version reads: "The assembly of the
                        first-born who are enrolled in heaven." In an old gospel song
                        we ask the question, "Is my name written there, on the page
                        white and fair?" Nothing is more important for us than to know
                        that our names are retained in the Lamb's book of life.

                           What is the ultimate end of those whose names are not
                        found in that book? Rev. 20:15.

                           How widespread will be the worship of the beast before
                        our Lord returns? Rev. 13:8.

                           At the end of earth's history the whole human race will be
                        divided into just two groups—those who give their homage to
                        the beast, after his wound has been fully 'healed, and those
                        whose names are found in the book of life.
                           What is Christ's promise to those who overcome in the
                        battle against the powers of evil? Rev. 3:5.

 THINK IT THROUGH          Do I know my name is "written in heaven"? If not, why
                        not?

                           "Over every soul that is rescued from the power of evil, and
                        whose name is registered in the Lamb's book of life, the con-
                        troversy is repeated. Never is one received into the family of
                        God without exciting the determined resistance of the enemy.
                        But He who was the hope of Israel then, their defense, their
                        justification and redemption, is the hope of the church today."

The Beast and the Lamb LESSON 2                                              Friday
                                                                             July12

           Part 6      "If any man have an ear, let him hear. He that leadeth
      THE SAINTS    into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the
                    sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience
                    and the faith of the saints." Rev. 13:9, 10.

                        Instead of "the patience and faith of the saints," the New
                    English Bible reads, "the fortitude and faithfulness of God's
                    people," implying both courage and constancy in the midst of
                    bitter persecution. During the forty-two prophetic months (verse
                    5) or the 1,260 prophetic days (chapter 12:6) the true church
                    suffered severely. Many times they cried inwardly: "How long,
                    0 Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our
                    blood?" Chapter 6:10. But in chapter 13 we see the captor
                    captured, the persecutor avenged.

                       How do both John and Daniel speak of the power of this
                    apostate church? Rev. 13:7; Dan. 7:25.

                       The wording of the New English Bible is again most impres-
                    sive: "It was also allowed to wage war on God's people and
                    to defeat them" (Rev. 13'3), and "the saints shall be delivered
                    into his power." Dan. 7:25. Through those centuries of perse-
                    cution millions of true and steadfast Christians revealed before
                    an astonished world what the grace of God can do in spite of
                    pain and torture.
                       What did the prophecy say would happen at the end of
                    the 1,260 days or years? Rev. 13:10.

                        True to Bible prophecy, events occurred in Europe which
                    resulted in the pope's being taken prisoner by General Berthier
                    of France. This was in the year 1798, exactly 1,260 years after
                    538 when the Arian Ostrogoths had been "plucked up by the
                    roots" (Dan. 7:8), making way for the papacy to dominate the
                    nations of Europe. How accurate is the Word of God! But great
                    trials still await the children of God.

 THINK IT THROUGH       Would my faith be strong enough to sustain me under
                    torture even unto death?

                       "God 'desires His people to prepare for the soon-coming
                    crisis. Prepared or unprepared, they must all meet it; and those
                    only who have brought their lives into conformity to the divine
                    standard, will stand firm at that time of test and trial. When
                    secular rulers unite with ministers of religion to dictate in mat-
                    ters of conscience, then it will be seen who really fear and
                    serve God."—The Acts of the Apostles, pages 431, 432.

              Part 1      From whence did this second beast-power come?
     THE TWO-HORNED
                          "And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth;
             BEAST I   and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke as a
                       dragon." Rev. 13:11.

                          "The first beast was from the 'sea;' the second came up
                       from the 'earth.' The sea represents 'peoples, and multitudes,
                       and nations, and tongues' (Revelation 17:15), a true picture
                       of Europe, where the papal beast arose. The earth must repre-
                       sent, not a crowded country of diverse nations, but a sparsely
                       populated and isolated area. And where was there such a
                       place? Certainly not in Europe or Asia. True to the prophecy,
                       something tremendous was happening across the Atlantic. A
                       century and a half before this time, colonies had begun to
                       spring up in America. By 1776 these colonies had bound them-
                       selves together and were waging the Revolutionary War, sever-
                       ing themselves from Europe. Thus the foundation was laid for
                       a completely new nation."—R. A. Anderson, Unfolding the
                       Revelation, pages 138, 139.
                          How does the prophet describe this second beast's en-
                       trance into the international scene? Verse 11.
                          The Greek word anabaino means to come up quietly, un-
                       obtrusively, but quickly, as a springing vegetable. And that is
                       how the United States of America arose. One historian says,
                       "Like a silent seed we grew into an empire."
                          When was this nation, symbolized by the beast with two
                       horns, to arise? Answer: At the time the ten-horned beast re-
                       ceived its "deadly wound." See Rev. 13:3, 11, 12.

                           The United States Constitution was ratified in 1789, the very
                       year the French Revolution broke out, which eventually brought
                       to an end the 1,260-year period.
                          John Wesley's interpretation of this prophecy about 1760
                       is arresting. He said: "He is not yet come, though he cannot
                       be far off. For he is to appear at the end of the forty-two months
                       of the first beast."—Explanatory Notes Upon the New Testa-
                       ment. Quoted in Unfolding the Revelation, page 139.
                           "The United States is a land that has been under the special
                       shield of the Omnipotent One. God has done great things for
                       this country, but in the transgression of His law, men have been
                       doing a work originated by the man of sin. Satan is working
                       out his designs to involve the human family in disloyalty."—

  THE TWO-HORNED    And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before
                    him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to
         BEAST II   worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed."
                    Rev. 13:11, 12.

                       With what is the power of the two-horned beast compared?
                    Verse 12.
                       "Prophecy represents Protestantism as having lamblike
                    horns, but speaking as a dragon. Already we are beginning to
                    hear the voice of the dragon. There is a satanic force propelling
                    the Sunday movement, but it is concealed.. . .
                       "Let not the commandment-keeping people of God be silent
                    at this time, as though we gracefully accepted the situation.
                    There is the prospect before us of waging a continuous war,
                    at the risk of imprisonment, of losing property and even life
                    itself, to defend the law of God, which is being made void by
                    the laws of men."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Com-

                       When the two-horned beast compels the people to wor-
                    ship, whom will they be worshiping? Verse 12.

                       The prediction that it will speak "as a dragon" (verse 11)
                    and exercise "all the power of the first beast" plainly foretells
                    a development of the spirit of intolerance and persecution that
                    was manifested by the powers represented by the dragon and
                    the leopardlike beast. The statement that the beast with two
                    horns "causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to
                    worship the first beast" indicates that the authority of this
                    nation is to be exercised in enforcing some observance which
                    shall be an act of homage to the papacy.

 THINK IT THROUGH       Am I prepared for the time when liberty will be cur-
                    tailed and I will be under pressure of law for failure to pay
                    homage to a power alien to the gospel of Christ? What will
                    be my stand at that time?

                        "Only in flagrant violation of these safeguards to the nation's
                    liberty, can any religious observance be enforced by civil au-
                    thority. But the inconsistency of such action is no greater than
                    is represented in the symbol. It is the beast with lamblike
                    horns—in profession pure, gentle, and harmless—that speaks

                       Rev. 13:13, 14.
                           What does the Spirit of God declare will happen "in the
                       latter times"? 1 Tim. 4:1.
                          Just prior to our Lord's return there will exist widespread
                       ungodliness and religious declension. Apostasy from God's
                       truth is what makes this possible.

                          "The man of sin, who thought to change times and laws,
                       and who has always oppressed the people of God, will cause
                       laws to be made enforcing the observance of the first day of
                       the week. But God's people are to stand firm for Him. And the

                       14.
                          When the prophet Elijah challenged the prophets and priests
                       of Baal, he asked God to reveal His power by sending fire from
                       heaven. In the last days the enemy of righteousness will use
                       every kind of device to deceive. Those who say that seeing is
                       believing may be deluded. Only God's Word will sustain God's
                       people in the coming days of trial and test. The promise is
                       clear: "Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I
                       also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall
                       come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth."

           Part 4      What does prophecy indicate will be made in honor of
    THE IMAGE TO    the beast?
       THE BEAST      "Saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should
                    make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a
                    sword, and did live." Rev. 13:14.
                       "The 'image to the beast' represents that form of apostate
                    Protestantism which will be developed when the Protestant
                    churches shall seek the aid of the civil power for the enforce-
                    ment of their dogmas. The 'mark of the beast' still remains to
                    be defined.
                       "After the warning against the worship of the beast and his
                    image the prophecy declares: 'Here are they that keep the com-
                    mandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.' Since those who
                    keep God's commandments are thus placed in contrast with
                    those that worship the beast and his image and receive his
                    mark, it follows that the keeping of God's law, on the one hand,
                    and its violation, on the other, will make the distinction be-
                    tween the worshipers of God and the worshipers of the beast."
                    —The Great Controversy, pages 445, 446.
                       What will "the image of the beast" encourage the people
                    to do? Verse 15.
                       "To understand what would constitute an image of the papal
                    beast, we must first gain some definite idea of what constitutes
                    the papacy itself. The full development of the beast, or the
                    establishment of papal supremacy, dates from the famous letter
                    of Justinian, which was made effective in A.D. 538, constituting
                    the pope the head of the church and the corrector of heretics.
                    The papacy was a church clothed with civil power—an eccle-
                    siastical body having authority to punish all dissenters with
                    confiscation of goods, imprisonment, torture, and death. What
                    would be an image of the papacy?—Another ecclesiastical
                    establishment clothed with civil power, in other words, a union
                    of church and state."—Uriah Smith, Daniel and the Revelation,

                    upon such points of doctrine as are held by them in common,
                    shall influence the state to enforce their decrees and to sustain
                    their institutions, then Protestant America will have formed an
                    image of the Roman hierarchy, and the infliction of civil penal-.

                      11, 16.

                      and reputation will join with the lawless and the vile to take

                      will combine to cover them with contempt. Persecuting rulers,
                      ministers, and church members will conspire against them.
                      With voice and pen, by boasts, threats, and ridicule, they will

                         What is the mark of the beast? See verse 16.

                         "Mark. Gr. charagma, 'an impress,' a stamp,' a mark.' This
                      is evidently some badge of loyalty to the beast, some special
                      feature that denotes that the one displaying such a mark wor-
                      ships the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed (v. 8).
                      Adventist interpreters understand this mark to be not a literal
                      brand but some sign of allegiance that identifies the bearer as
                      loyal to the power represented by the beast. The controversy
                      at that time will center on the law of God, and particularly on
                      the fourth command. . . . Hence the observance of Sunday will
                      constitute such a sign, but only at the time when the beast's
                      power will be revived and Sunday observance becomes a
                      matter of compliance with civil law."—SDA Bible Commen-

                                                                             July 19


           Part 6      "And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had
  THE MAN, NAME,    the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his
                    name. Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count
    AND NUMBER
                    the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and
                    his number is Six hundred threescore and six." Rev. 13:17, 18.

                       All through the Revelation two supernatural powers are con-
                    trasted—the man of sin and the Man of Salvation. In this lesson
                    we reach one of the great crises of the book, where a promi-
                    nent enemy of truth is unmasked and identified.

                       What will be the result of not receiving the mark? Verse 17.

                        Satan says, "'I will be ruler of the earth, prince of the world.
                    I will so control the minds under my power that God's Sabbath
                    shall be an object of contempt. A sign? I will make the observ-
                    ance of the seventh day a sign of disloyalty to the authorities
                    of earth. Human laws shall be made so stringent that men and
                    women will not dare to observe the seventh-day Sabbath. For
                    fear of wanting food and clothing, they will join with the world
                    in transgressing God's law; and the earth will be wholly under
                    my dominion.' "—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Com-
                    mentary, Vol. 4, p. 1172.
                       What is the significant number associated with the beast?
                    Verse 18.

                        A footnote in the Douay Version, the official Roman Catholic
                    Bible, reads: "The numeral letters of his name shall make up
                    this number" (meaning 666). However, the implication is given
                    that this "antichrist" has not yet appeared.
                        The title Vicarius Filii Dei, meaning "vicar of the Son of
                    God," is a title held by the pope. This title has the value in
                    Roman numerals of 666. This coincidence alone proves noth-
                    ing, but in the context of the prophecy it adds one more point
                    of identification of the beast power.
 THINK IT THROUGH      What should be my attitude toward Catholic people, and
                    how should I use interpretations of prophecy that are uncom-
                    plimentary to Catholic ears?

                       "We should be careful not to thrust and crowd and condemn
                    those who have not the light that we have. We should not go
                    out of our way to make hard thrusts at the Catholics. Among
                    the Catholics there are many who are most conscientious
                    Christians and who walk in all the light that shines upon them,
                    and God will work in their behalf. . . . Do not censure others;
                    do not condemn them."—Testimonies, Vol. 9, p. 243.

                                          "And the third angel followed them,

                                     worship the beast and his image, and
                                        receive his mark in his forehead, or in
                                         his hand, the same shall drink of the
                                         wine of the wrath of God, which is

                                   his indignation." Rev. 14:9, 10.

              Part 1      "And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion,
     THE VICTORIOUS    and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having
                       his Father's name written in their foreheads. And I heard a
           COMPANY     voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the
                       voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers
                       harping with their harps: and they sung as it were a new
                       song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the
                       elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred
                       and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from
                       the earth." Rev. 14:1-3.
                          What a wonderfully inspiring scene this is in comparison
                       with the tragic picture of the last verses of chapter 13! This
                       fourteenth chapter is closely related however to chapters 12
                       and 13. John in vision is watching the preparations for the
                       final battle between two great opposing powers. The dragon
                       under all kinds of disguises is marshalling his forces to op-
                       pose God's loyal remnant.
                          What is the main identification seen in this victorious group
                       with the Lamb? Verse 1.
                          The "Father's name" contrasts strongly with the "mark of
                       the beast." The 144,000 sealed ones we already noticed in
                       chapter 7. There they are presented as having been gathered
                       from all nations. Here they appear with Christ on Mount Zion.
                          What does John hear this triumphant group doing? Verse 3.
                           John speaks of their song as new because it tells of a new
                       experience—full salvation from sin. And no one could learn
                       it except those who had passed through the "time of trouble"
                       referred to in Daniel 12:1. These have been sealed with "the
                       seal of the living God." Rev. 7:2. And that seal is associated
                       with the name of God the Father. The only commandment of
                       the ten which contains His name and His office revealing His
                       authority is the fourth, the Sabbath command. But that is the
                       very one the beast and the false prophet have attempted to
                       change. These that stand with Christ as conquerors at the last
                       will be a loyal and faithful people to the end.
 THINK IT THROUGH          How can I be certain to take part in that great song of
                       victory?
                          "Upon the crystal sea before the throne, that sea of glass
                       as it were mingled with fire,—so resplendent is it with the glory
                       of God,—are gathered the company that have 'gotten the vic-
                       tory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark,
                       and over the number of his name.' "—The Great Controversy,

            Part 2      "These are they which were not defiled with women; for
  THE FIRSTFRU ITS   they are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb
                     whithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from among
                     men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb. And in
                     their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault
                     before the throne of God." Rev. 14:4, 5.

                         "Those constituting this special company are undefiled in
                     life and doctrine. A woman in prophecy denotes a church. In
                     Revelation 17:5 we have the picture of an impure woman with
                     her daughters, all of whom have partaken of the same unholy
                     nature. . . . But the 144,000 are not defiled with these women,
                     or these apostate churches. They have a pure faith not defiled
                     by false teachings; it is 'the faith of Jesus.' "—R. A. Anderson,
                     Unfolding the Revelation, page 148.

                        What special honor is given to the sealed ones? Verse 4.

                        The privilege of following the Lamb throughout His vast
                     creation, to explore those undreamed of constellations beyond
                     the range of our telescopes and learn from the lips of our Re-
                     deemer the history of areas beyond our imagination, should
                     inspire us to greater faithfulness and dedication.

                        What is this specially sealed company called? Verse 4.

                        The expression "firstfruits" has reference not to a point of
                     time but rather to quality. Christ is called "the firstfruits of
                     them that slept." 1 Cor. 15:20. Yet we know that He was not
                     the first in time to be raised from the dead. But He certainly
                     was the first in quality and the greatest in victory.

 THINK IT THROUGH       Am I following my Lord so closely now that I can be as-
                     sured of following Him in the hereafter?

                         "The cross of Christ will be the science and the song of the
                     redeemed through all eternity. In Christ glorified they will be-
                     hold Christ crucified. Never will it be forgotten that He whose
                     power created and upheld the unnumbered worlds through the
                     vast realms of space, the Beloved of God, the Majesty of
                     heaven, He whom cherub and shining seraph delighted to
                     adore—humbled Himself to uplift fallen man; that He bore the
                     guilt and shame of sin, and the hiding of His Father's face, till
                     the woes of a lost world broke His heart and crushed out His

             Part 3       "And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, hav-

                      tains of waters." Rev. 14:6, 7.
                          What is the secret of victory for God's remnant in the last
                      great crisis when everything on earth is against them? The
                      answer is found in the three special messages God is sending
                      to the world.
                         What is the first angel's message called? Verse 6.

                          "God has always had but one gospel, sometimes called 'the
                      gospel of God,' the gospel of grace,' the gospel of Jesus
                      Christ,' the gospel of the kingdom,' etc. These different ex-
                      pressions merely emphasize different phases of the same
                      glorious gospel or good news! It was proclaimed to Adam
                       before he was driven from Eden. Noah, too, was 'a preacher of
                      righteousness.' 2 Peter 2.5       Faithful Abraham taught the
                      same glorious gospel (Galations 3:8)."—R. A. Anderson, Un-
                      folding the Revelation, page 150.
                        In what setting is the gospel being proclaimed in the first
                      angel's message? Verse 7.
                         Paul preached concerning a "judgment to come" (Acts 24:
                      25), but the message today is that the hour of God's judgment
                      is come. The announcement is in the present tense. The judg-
                      ment here mentioned is the investigative judgment, that which
                      precedes the second advent. When Christ returns, He brings
                      His rewards with Him. See Rev. 22:12.

 THINK IT THROUGH        How can I in my daily life give God the glory due to Him?
                      Am I more concerned with my own personal interests than
                      with God's glory?
                          "Had the Sabbath been universally kept, man's thoughts
                      and affections would have been led to the Creator as the ob-
                      ject of reverence and worship, and there would never have
                      been an idolator, an atheist, or an infidel. The keeping of the
                      Sabbath is a sign of loyalty to the true God, 'Him that made
                      heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.'
                      It follows that the message which commands men to worship
                      God and keep His commandments will especially call upon
                      them to keep the fourth commandment."—The Great Con-

 ANGEL'S MESSAGE
                        This is the first time the word "Babylon" is found in the
                    Revelation. At the time John wrote, the ancient city was in
                    ruins. The city was originally founded by Nimrod (Gen. 10:10;
                    11:1-9), and greatly expanded by the Nebuchadnezzar of Dan-
                    iel's time. It stood as the emblem of apostasy and rebellion. In
                    both the Old and New Testaments Babylon is contrasted with
                    Jerusalem, the one a symbol of human glory and self-worship,
                    the other the symbol of God's glory and divine worship. Salem
                    means "peace" but one connotation of Babel is "confusion."
                       What startling announcement does this second angel make?

                        The Protestant reformers of the sixteenth century consist-
                    ently applied the term "Babylon" to the papacy—the church
                    with its headquarters in Rome. In John's day Rome was called
                    "Babylon" by the Christians. In the light of chapter 17:5 more
                    than one church is included, for the prophecy calls her "the
                    mother of harlots," the daughters partaking of the same char-
                    acter as the mother. "Tertullian, who lived at the close of the
                    second century, specifically declares that the term Babylon in
                    the Apocalypse refers to the capital city of imperial Rome.. .
                        "Babylon, both literal and mystical, has thus long been rec-
                    ognized as the traditional enemy of God's truth and people.
                    As used in the Revelation the name is symbolic of all apostate
                    religious organizations and their leadership, from antiquity down
                    to the close of time."—SDA Bible Commentary, on Rev. 14:8.
                       With what is spiritual Babylon charged?

                       The expression "made all nations drink" of the unholy wine
                    of her false teachings suggests coercion. The pressure of the
                    state will doubtless be used to enforce her decrees.
 THINK IT THROUGH       If pressure were applied to force me to compromise my
                    faith, what would be my attitude?

                        "As the storm approaches, a large class who have professed
                    faith in the third angel's message, but have not been sanctified
                    through obedience to the truth, abandon their position and join
                    the ranks of the opposition. . . . They become the most bitter
                    enemies of their former brethren. . . .
                        "In this time of persecution the faith of the Lord's servants
                    will be tried."—The Great Controversy, page 608.

The Three Angels' Messages LESSON 4                                    ❑ Thursday
                                                                           July 25

             Part 5      "And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud
 THE THIRD ANGEL'S    voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and re-
                      ceive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall
          MESSAGE     drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out
                      without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall
                      be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the
                      holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb." Rev. 14:9, 10.

                         No other message in all the Bible is more solemn than this.
                      In view of the world-wide apostasy and boycott predicted in
                      chapter 13:16, 17, it comes with forcible meaning.
                        Intoxicated with the wine of Babylon's false teaching,
                      what will these marked ones finally drink? Verse 10.

                          About a hundred years after the apostles the church began
                      to lose her sense of loyalty to God and gradually accepted the
                      practices of the pagan world. The great truth of life only in
                      Christ was set aside for the corrupt doctrine of natural immor-
                      tality, claiming that all souls are immortal. Infant baptism re-
                      placed the Biblical practice of immersion, and the keeping of
                      Sunday holy replaced observance of Christ's Sabbath.
                          In what manner is God's message concerning this apostasy
                      to be given? Verse 9.

                         "There are now true Christians in every church, not except-
                      ing the Roman Catholic communion, who honestly believe that
                      Sunday is the Sabbath of divine appointment. God accepts
                      their sincerity of purpose and their integrity before Him. But
                      when Sunday observance shall be enforced by law, and the
                      world shall be enlightened concerning the obligation of the
                      true Sabbath, then whoever shall transgress the command of
                      God, to obey a precept which has no higher authority than that
                      of Rome, will thereby honor popery above God. . . . It is not
                      until the issue is thus plainly set before the people, and they
                      are brought to choose between the commandments of God
                      and the commandments of men, that those who continue in
                      transgression will receive 'the mark of the beast.' "—The Great
                      Controversy, page 449.

 THINK IT THROUGH        When will Sundaykeeping become the mark of the beast?

                         "Sundaykeeping is not yet the mark of the beast, and will
                      not be until the decree goes forth causing men to worship this
                      idol sabbath. The time will come when this day will be the
                      test, but that time has not come yet."—Ellen G. White Com-

The Three Angels' Messages LESSON 4                                      ❑ Friday
                                                                             July 26

           Part 6      "They have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast
    TRUE WORSHIP    and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his
                    name. Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that
       IDENTIFIED   keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus. And
                    I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed
                    are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea,
                    saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and
                    their works do follow them." Rev. 14:11-13.
                      Only the faith of Jesus will enable God's loyal witnesses to
                    remain true and faithful in the coming crisis.
                       What are the characteristics of the saints? Verse 12.
                       The word "patience" can also be translated "steadfastness"
                    or "fortitude." In chapter 13:10, when referring to the steadfast-
                    ness of the martyrs who faced persecution and death we find
                    these words linked—"patience and faith." But in chapter 14:12
                    where it refers to the final test we note a third characteristic
                    —obedience to God's commands. So it could read patience,
                    obedience, and faith.
                        What special blessing is reserved for those who die in the
                    Lord during the time of the third message? Verse 13.
                       During the "time of trouble" spoken of by Daniel, there will
                    be a special resurrection in which two different groups of the
                    dead will be raised. We read "many of them that sleep in the
                    dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and
                    some to shame and everlasting contempt." Dan. 12:2.
                       "All who have died in the faith of the third angel's message
                    come forth from the tomb glorified, to hear God's covenant of
                    peace with those who have kept His law. 'They also which
                    pierced Him' (Revelation 1:7), those that mocked and derided
                    Christ's dying agonies, and the most violent opposers of His
                    truth and His people, are raised to behold Him in His glory
                    and to see the honor placed upon the loyal and obedient."—

                    comes before 'the Ancient of Days' to receive the kingdom and
                    dominion for which He died. Daniel 7:13. This is actually the
                    marriage of the Bridegroom—the Lamb—and occurs before
                    He returns to earth for His saints. His waiting saints, those
                    caught up to meet Him, are then taken to 'the marriage supper
                    of the Lamb' in the Father's house. Revelation 19:7-9."—R. A.

King is coming
   "And they sing the song of Moses the servant
of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great
and marvelous are thy works, Lord God Al-
mighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King
of saints." Rev. 15:3.

    "What a song that will be when the ransomed
of the Lord meet at the gate of the Holy City,
which is thrown back on its glittering hinges, and
the nations that have kept His word—His com-
mandments—enter into the city, the crown of the
overcomer is placed upon their heads, and the
golden harps are placed in their hands! All heaven
is filled with rich music, and with songs of praise
to the Lamb. Saved, everlastingly saved, in the
kingdom of glory! To have a life that measures
with the life of God—that is the reward."—Ellen

    "With Paul they can say, 'I have fought a good
fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the
faith: henceforth there is laid up for me a crown
of righteousness, which the Lord the righteous
judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me
only, but unto all them also which love his ap-
pearing.' There are many whose grey hairs God
honors because they have fought a good fight
and kept the faith."—Ellen G. White Comments,

              Part 1      "And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the
     THE SON OF MAN    cloud one sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head

          DESCENDS
                          On what is the Saviour seated when He comes again?
                       Verses 14, 16.

                          The fact that this radiant picture of Christ's return imme-
                       diately follows the giving of the three angels' messages shows
                       that these messages are indeed God's final warning and appeal.
                          What does He wear in token of His kingship? Verse 14.

                           In chapter 19:12 we see Him crowned with "many crowns."
                       We note also that He has a "sharp sickle" indicative of the
                       harvest He has come to reap. This picture is drawn from the
                       Old Testament. In Joel 3:13 we read: "Put ye in the sickle,
                       for the harvest is ripe." Jesus said, "The harvest is the end
                       of the world; and the reapers are the angels." Matt. 13:39.
                          How does the apostle Paul describe Christ's coming?
                       1 Thess. 4:16, 17.

                           "With anthems of celestial melody the holy angels, a vast,
                       unnumbered throng, attend Him on His way. The firmament
                       seems filled with radiant forms—'ten thousand times ten thou-
                       sand, and thousands of thousands.' No human pen can por-
                       tray the scene; no mortal mind is adequate to conceive its
                       splendor. 'His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was
                       full of His praise. And His brightness was as the light.' Ha-
                       bakkuk 3:3, 4. As the living cloud comes still nearer, every eye
                       beholds the Prince of life. No crown of thorns now mars that
                       sacred head; but a diadem of glory rests on His holy brow.
                       His countenance outshines the dazzling brightness of the noon-
                       day sun. 'And He hath on His vesture and on His thigh a name
                       written, King of kings, and Lord of lords.' Revelation 19:16."

                       Him. In the place of a crown of thorns, He will wear a crown
                       of glory,—a crown within a crown. In place of that old purple
                       kingly robe, He will be clothed in raiment of whitest white, `so

           Part 2       "And another angel came out of the temple, crying with
     THE HARVEST    a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle,
                    and reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest
                    of the earth is ripe. And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his
                    sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped. And another
                    angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also
                    having a sharp sickle. And another angel came out from
                    the altar, which had power over fire; and cried with a loud
                    cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in thy
                    sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth;
                    for her grapes are fully ripe. And the angel thrust in his
                    sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and
                    cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God." Rev.
                    14:15-19.
                       From whence did John see the angel come who cried out,
                    "Thrust in thy sickle"? Verse 15.
                       As we noticed in chapter 4, John in vision was invited into
                    the throne room of the Eternal. And so the scenes that were
                    caused to pass before him were transpiring in the temple in
                    heaven. For example, the four "beasts" or "living creatures"
                    to which we gave special attention are noted in other scenes.
                    See chapters 7; 11; 14:3; 15:7; 19:4. The prophet himself refers
                    to scenes happening before him in heaven.
                       How many harvests are referred to in verses 15 to 18?
                       In ancient Israel there were two harvests—the harvest of
                    grain and the harvest of fruit, especially grapes. These two
                    harvests are used to represent the saints and the wicked. And it
                    is worthy of special notice that when this prophecy applies both
                    harvests are "fully ripe."
                       The first angel from the temple cried to the Son of Man to
                    reap His harvest. "Gather my saints together unto me; those
                    that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice." Ps. 50:5.
                    Another angel came from the altar and cried, "Gather the
                    clusters of the vine of the earth." The one with the sharp sickle
                    harvested "the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great
                    winepress of the wrath of God." Verses 18 and 19.
 Till" IT THROUGH       What is the significance of the harvest being "ripe"?
                        "The truth and the glory of God are inseparable; it is im-
                    possible for us, with the Bible within our reach, to honor God
                    by erroneous opinions. Many claim that it matters not what
                    one believes, if his life is only right. But the life is molded by
                    the faith. If light and truth is within our reach, and we neglect
                    to improve the privilege of hearing and seeing it, we virtually
                    reject it; we are choosing darkness rather than light."—The

                Part 3       "And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous,
     THE SEA OF GLASS    seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is
                         filled up the wrath of God. And I saw as it were a sea of
                         glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory
                         over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and
                         over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, hav-
                         ing the harps of God." Rev. 15: 1, 2.

                            In what glowing terms does John speak of the scene that
                         passes before him? Verse 1.

                             The New English Bible reads: "Another great and astonish-
                         ing portent." What a change is the victorious company on the
                         "sea of glass" compared with the forgoing scene of carnage
                         and destruction! Such contrasts are characteristic of apocalyp-
                         tic literature, especially the book of Revelation. So before pic-
                         turing the triumphant company on the "sea of glass," reference
                         is made to the "seven last plagues," which forms the basis of
                         chapter 16.
                            Who especially are the ones joining in the anthem of
                         praise on the sea of glass? Verse 2.

                             "The sea of glass mingled with fire" is very descriptive.
                             "Those who have witnessed the brilliant spectacle of a
                         tropic sunset at sea have caught a faint idea of the glory the
                         prophet here attempts to describe. As the great sun sinks like
                         a ball of blazing fire, the ocean itself seems to break forth
                         into flames of glory; the waves, touched with crimson, transform
                         the whole scene into a mingling of flood and flame. So was
                         the scene that opened to the Patmos prophet."—R. A. Ander-
                         son, Unfolding the Revelation, page 162.
                             And the most wonderful thing about it is that everyone, no
                         matter who he is or where he was born can, if he maintains
                         faith in Jesus, be part of that number.
 THINK IT THROUGH            What is the meaning of the quadruple victory (Rev. 15:2)
                         attributed to the saints on the sea of glass?

                            "Although church and state will unite their power to com-
                         pel 'all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond'
                         (Revelation 13:16), to receive 'the mark of the beast,' yet the
                         people of God will not receive it. The prophet of Patmos be-
                         holds 'them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and
                         over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his
                         name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God' and
                         singing the song of Moses and the Lamb. Revelation 15:2, 3."

The King Is Coming       LESSON 5                                  ❑   Wednesday
                                                                          July 31

           Part 4      "And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and
     THE MAJESTY    the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous are thy
                    works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou
       OF CHRIST    King of saints." Rev. 15:3.

                       Again scenes of victory and glory are set over against
                    scenes of defeat and destruction (see chapter 14:18-20). The
                    members of this triumphant host voice their praise to Him
                    through whom they have conquered sin and the grave.

                       What is the anthem sung by the redeemed on the sea of
                    glass? Verse 3.

                       "It is the song of Moses because it voices the praise of
                    those who, like ancient Israel at the Red Sea, have been
                    miraculously delivered from impending destruction. But it is
                    also the song of the Lamb because it speaks of the triumph
                    of God's people over death and the grave. It will be a song of
                    experience, and only those who have passed through the ex-
                    perience will be able to join in that paean of praise. . . . Poor
                    lost sinners redeemed by grace will tell the story in an anthem
                    never heard before."—R. A. Anderson, Unfolding the Revela-
                    tion, page 163.
                       In Jeremiah 10:6, 7 we find similar language. Here the
                    prophet contrasted the gods of the heathen with the living
                    God, whom he calls "King of the nations."
                        "The song celebrates the noble acts of the Lord; it declares
                    them to be great; but it is not their greatness, it is their righ-
                    teousness and faithfulness which calls forth the grateful praise."
                    —Ellicott's Commentary, on Rev. 15:3. With the long period of
                    oppression and persecution, all the universe will then see God's
                    acts as altogether righteous, even the seeming delay in bring-
                    ing about the destruction of evil.

                       On what principles does the psalmist state God's throne is
                    founded? Ps. 58:11; 97:2.

 THINK IT THROUGH     Compare Revelation 15:3, 4 with the song of Moses in
                    Exodus 15:1-18.

                       The Revelation is full of Christ. Twenty-seven times in this
                    book He is called "the Lamb." He is our Priest at the throne
                    of grace, our Creator and Redeemer, and our coming King. He
                    is the key to earth's history and the victory of the saints.
                    Through Him alone we can overcome the dragon, the beast,
                    and the false prophet. Praise Him for His unspeakable gift.

             Part 5     Because our Lord is holy, what shall be our attitude to His
      THE HOLINESS    name?
            OF GOD       "Who shall not fear thee, 0 Lord, and glorify thy name?
                      for thou only art holy: for all nations shall come and worship
                      before thee; for thy judgments are made manifest." Rev. 15:4.

                         The word translated "holy" in this passage is applied to one
                      who reverences sacred obligations. God imposes upon Him-
                      self the responsibility as "Judge of all the earth" (Gen. 18:25)
                      to do right and vindicate the expectations of those who put
                      their trust in Him.
                        What name did our Lord give to Moses as the name of
                      God he was to convey to the children of Israel? Ex. 3:14, 15.

                          His name baffles exposition, while His many titles are be-
                      yond natural man's understanding. In the desert He expressed
                      Himself at the burning bush to Moses, supplying a graphic
                      illustration of His timeless, changeless, tireless, divine nature.
                          "God had previously expressed His title Elohim to the pa-
                      triarchs, which by its meaning suggests the God who wills all
                      that He does. He now tells Moses that He is about to make
                      Himself known to Israel as Jehovah, by demonstrating Himself
                      as the God who does all that He wills."—Charles J. Rolls, The
                      World's Greatest Name.
                        When the saints shall sing the song of Moses and of the
                      Lamb, what has been made manifest? Rev. 15:4.

                         God's judgments are at last being revealed. It has not always
                      been possible for men to understand the ways to God. But in
                      the end all will be made plain. "For now we see through a
                      glass, darkly." Another translation reads, "Now we see only
                      puzzling reflections in a mirror, but then we shall see face to
                      face. My knowledge now is partial; then it will be whole, like
                      God's knowledge of me." 1 Cor. 13:12, NEB.

 THINK IT THROUGH        Distinguish between fearing and glorifying God's name.

                         "The King of heaven is from everlasting to everlasting. Stars
                      and seas, mountains and meadows, times and seasons do not
                      contribute one whit to the sovereignty or superiority of heaven.
                      He is eternal though all else be temporal, He is impregnable
                      though all else be vulnerable, He is immortal though all else
                      be corruptible. Of Him it is written 'Thou remainest.' "—Charles

            Part 6      Read Rev. 15:5-8.
 CHRIST'S CLOSING
         MINISTRY       This Scripture reveals the awesome preparation for the out-
                     pouring of God's wrath upon the corrupters of the earth and
                     the destroyers of His people. The seven last plagues fall after
                     the close of probation, at the end of Christ's ministry in the
                     heavenly sanctuary.
                        What does the prophet call the temple in heaven? Verse 5.

                        The RSV reads: "The temple of the tent of witness in
                     heaven," as do other translations. Stephen spoke of "the taber-
                     nacle of witness in the wilderness," which was made after the
                     pattern showed in the mount. Acts 7:44. The tabernacle con-
                     tained "the ark of the testimony," so called because it con-
                     tained the law which was God's testimony to Israel. See Ex.
                     32:15, 16; 25:21.
                        Who handed to the angels the vials with the plagues?
                     Verse 7.

                        How appropriate that one of those beings, closely connected
                     with Jesus, should deliver to the ministers of vengeance the
                     vials of wrath for those who have blasphemed the Saviour and
                     persecuted His followers! Before the plagues fall upon the
                     guilty, however, the ministration of mercy will have ceased.
                       What did John see filling the temple while the angels of
                     vengeance were engaged in their work? Verse 8.

                        The Scripture clearly indicates that no man, or actually no
                     being, can enter the temple during the outpouring of the seven
                     last plagues of God's judgments. There will be no Intercessor,
                     no Mediator. And to feel the wrath of God unmixed with mercy
                     is an experience beyond our imagination.

 THINK IT THROUGH      "My accompanying angel said, 'Time is almost finished.
                     Do you reflect the lovely image of Jesus as you should?' "
                     —"Early Writings," page 64.

                        Ellen G. White wrote: "In the temple in heaven, the dwelling
                     place of God, His throne is established in righteousness and
                     judgment. In the most holy place is His law, the great rule of
                     right by which all mankind are tested. The ark that enshrines
                     the tables of the law is covered with the mercy seat, before
                     which Christ pleads His blood in the sinner's behalf. Thus is
                     represented the union of justice and mercy in the plan of
                     human redemption."—The Great Controversy, page 415.

   "And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty,
true and righteous are thy judgments." Rev. 16:7.


     "The present is a solemn, fearful time for the church. The angels are already
girded, awaiting the mandate of God to pour their vials of wrath upon the world.
Destroying angels are taking up the work of vengeance; for the Spirit of God is
gradually withdrawing from the world. Satan is also mustering his forces of evil,
going forth 'unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world,' to gather them
under his banner, to be trained for 'the battle of that great day of God Almighty.'
Satan is to make most powerful efforts for the mastery in the last great conflict.
Fundamental principles will be brought out, and decisions made in regard to
them. Skepticism is prevailing everywhere. Ungodliness abounds. The faith of
individual members of the church will be tested as though there were not an-
other person in the world."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary,

               Part 1        "And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to
       THE FIRST AND     the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of
                         the wrath of God upon the earth. And the first went, and
     SECOND PLAGUES
                         poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a noisesome
                         and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the
                         beast, and upon them which worshipped his image. And the
                        second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it be-
                        came as the blood of a dead man: and every living soul died
                        in the sea." Rev. 16:1-3.
                            Twice in this chapter John says, "I heard a great voice out
                        of the temple." The first voice was a command to the angels:
                        "Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God."
                        When the voice was heard again it was an announcement: "It
                        is done!"
                            Upon whom did the first plague fall? Verse 2.
                            "Before the angel pours out his vial, the whole human race
                        will have divided itself into two classes: those who are sealed
                        with the seal of the living God, and those who have the mark
                        of the beast. To the one class who are under the protecting
                        wings of the Almighty, the promise is: 'Thou shalt not be afraid
                        for the . . . pestilence that walketh in darkness. . . . A thou-
                        sand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand;
                        but it shall not come nigh thee. . . . Neither shall any plague
                        come nigh thy dwelling.' Psalm 91:5-10."--R. A. Anderson,
                        Unfolding the Revelation, page 165:
                            When the prophet Jeremiah was predicting the overthrow
                        of ancient Babylon, what did he call God's weapons? Jer.
                        50:25.
                            Into what kind of cup is the wine of God's wrath poured?
                        Rev. 14:10.
                           Jeremiah's description of "all the kingdoms of the world"
                        being forced to drink the cup of the Lord's wrath is most im-
                        pressive. See Jeremiah 25:15-17, 26-28, 32, 33.
                            What terrible condition results from the second plague?
                        Rev. 16:3.
 THINK IT THROUGH           What am I doing now to prepare for divine protection
                        during the plagues?
                           "When Christ ceases His intercession in the sanctuary, the
                        unmingled wrath threatened against those who worship the
                        beast and his image and receive his mark (Revelation 14:9, 10),
                        will be poured out. The plagues upon Egypt when God was
                        about to deliver Israel were similar in character to those more
                        terrible and extensive judgments which are to fall upon the
                        world just before the final deliverance of God's people."—The

The Plagues LESSON 6                                                   ❑   Monday
                                                                           August 5

            Part 2       "And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers
 THE THIRD PLAGUE    and fountains of waters; and they became blood. And I heard
                     the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, 0 Lord, which
                     art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus.
                     For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and
                     thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.
                     And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God
                     Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments." Rev. 16:4-7.

                         What did Isaiah call God's judgments on Jerusalem that
                     is applicable also to the plagues? Isa. 28:21.
                         What is God's attitude to the death of the wicked? Ezek.
                     33:11.

                        "There will be a law against the Sabbath of God's creation,
                     and then it is that God will do His 'strange work' in the earth.
                     He has borne long with the perversity of the race; He has tried
                     to win them to Himself. But the time will come when they shall
                     have filled their measure of iniquity; and then it is that God
                     will work. This time is almost reached. God keeps a record
                     with the nations: the figures are swelling against them in the
                     books of heaven; and when it shall have become a law that
                     the transgression of the first day of the week shall be met with
                     punishment, then their cup will be full."—Ellen G. White Com-
                     ments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 7, p. 910.
                        "God's judgments will be visited upon those who are seeking
                     to oppress and destroy His people. His long forbearance with
                     the wicked emboldens men in transgression, but their punish-
                     ment is nonetheless certain and terrible because it is long
                     delayed. . . . By terrible things in righteousness He will vin-
                     dicate the authority of His downtrodden law. The severity of
                     the retribution awaiting the transgressor may be judged by the
                     Lord's reluctance to execute justice."—The Great Controversy,
                     page 627.
                       What did the "angel of the waters" say about God's judg-
                     ments upon the wicked? Rev. 16: 5, 6.

 THINK IT THROUGH       How can you reconcile the plagues with God's love?

                        Here is a wonderful promise of God's protection that is es-
                     pecially appropriate to the time of the plagues:
                        "He shall dwell on high: his place of defence shall be the
                     munitions of rocks: bread shall be given him; his waters shall
                     be sure." Isa. 33:16. See also Isa. 41:17, 18; 32:2.

The Plagues LESSON 6                                                   ❑ Tuesday
                                                                         August 6

            Part 3      "And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun;
THE FOURTH PLAGUE    and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire. And
                     men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the
                     name of God, which hath power over these plagues: and they
                     repented not to give him glory." Rev. 16: 8, 9.
                        "These plagues are not universal, or the inhabitants of the
                     earth would be wholly cut off. Yet they will be the most awful
                     scourges that have ever been known to mortals. All the judg-
                     ments upon men, prior to the close of probation, have been
                     mingled with mercy. The pleading blood of Christ has shielded
                     the sinner from receiving the full measure of his guilt; but in
                     the final judgment, wrath is poured out unmixed with mercy.
                        "In that day, multitudes will desire the shelter of God's
                     mercy which they have so long despised."—The Great Contro-
                     versy, pages 628, 629.
                        Upon what is the fourth plague poured? Verse 8.
                        What is the attitude of the people to this occurrence?
                     Verse 9.
                        Repentance is the work of the Holy Spirit on the heart. But
                     before the plagues fall the Spirit of God will have been with-
                     drawn from the earth. There is nothing to convict men of sin
                     and bring them to salvation. So they blaspheme the Almighty
                     and His holy name. It is a sad picture, but this is the end
                     result of persistent sin.
                       Enumerate the promises in Psalm 91 that are particularly
                     applicable to, the time of the plagues.
                         "In the ninety-first psalm is a most wonderful description
                     of the coming of the Lord to bring the wickedness of the wicked
                     to an end, and to give to those who have chosen Him as their
                     Redeemer the assurance of His love and protecting care.
                         "[Ps. 91:15 quoted.]"—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA
                     Bible Commentary, Vol. 3, p. 1150.
 THINK IT THROUGH        How can God's promises be more meaningful to me now,
                     before I face the time of trouble?
                        "Could men see with heavenly vision, they would behold
                     companies of angels that excel in strength stationed about
                     those who have kept the word of Christ's patience. With sym-
                     pathizing tenderness, angels have witnessed their distress and
                     have heard their prayers. They are waiting the word of their
                     Commander to snatch them from their peril. But they must wait
                     yet a little longer. The people of God must drink of the cup
                     and be baptized with the baptism."—The Great Controversy,

The Plagues LESSON 6                                                ❑ Wednesday
                                                                        August 7

            Part 4      "The fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the
 THE FIFTH PLAGUE    beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they
                     gnawed their tongues for pain, and blasphemed the God of
                     heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented
                     not of their deeds." Rev. 16:10, 11.
                        What is the fifth plague and upon what does it fall?
                     Verse 10.
                        The "seat" or "throne" of the beast-power is the main ob-
                     jective of the fifth plague, wherever the headquarters might
                     happen to be located. The papacy through its long history has
                     had its headquarters in Rome. But the "kingdom" might well
                     include the whole world at the time of the plagues. In verse 1
                     the command was, "Go your ways, and pour out the vials of
                     the wrath of God upon the earth." "It would therefore appear
                     that for the duration of this plague the entire world is envel-
                     oped in a pall of darkness. Thus, while men grope unrepent-
                     antly for light in a spiritually dark world, . . . God sends upon
                     them literal darkness, symbolic of the deeper spiritual night
                     that is yet to enshroud the earth."—SDA Bible Commentary,
                     on Rev. 16:10.
                        How do the wicked react under this plague? Verse 11.
                        As we have already noted, only the Holy Spirit can cause
                     men to repent. But the Spirit of God will have been withdrawn
                     from the earth before these judgments of God descend. The
                     wicked therefore have no sorrow for their sins, only basphemy
                     against God. This was their attitude during the fourth plague,
                     and it still persists.
                         What message in the Psalms can give comforting assurance
                     to the righteous during the fourth and fifth plagues? Ps. 121:
                     5-7.

 THINK IT THROUGH        Psalm 91:8 states that the righteous will see "the reward
                     of the wicked." What will be the effect of that scene on us?
                         "The people of God will not be free from suffering; but while
                     persecuted and distressed, while they endure privation and
                     suffer for want of food, they will not be left to perish. That
                     God who cared for Elijah will not pass by one of His self-sacri-
                     ficing children. He who numbers the hairs of their head will
                     care for them, and in time of famine they shall be satisfied.
                     While the wicked are dying from hunger and pestilence, angels
                     will shield the righteous and supply their wants. To him that
                     `walketh righteously' is the promise: 'Bread shall be given him;
                     his waters shall be sure.' "—The Great Controversy, page 629.

The Plagues LESSON 6                                                  ❑ Thursday
                                                                         August 8

            Part 5      "And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great
 THE SIXTH PLAGUE    river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the
                     way of the kings of the east might be prepared. And I saw
                     three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the
                     dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the
                     mouth of the false prophet. For they are the spirits of devils,
                     working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth
                     and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that
                     great day of God Almighty. Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed
                     is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk
                     naked, and they see his shame. And he gathered them to-
                     gether into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armaged-
                     don." Rev. 16:12-16.
                       Among the different aspects of the sixth plague three are
                     especially vital—(1) the miracle-working power of demons; (2)
                     their world-wide influence; (3) the gathering of the nations for
                     the battle of the great day of God.
                        From whence do these demonic spirits proceed? Verse 13.
                        The identity of the beast as the papacy we have already
                     noted in earlier lessons. And the false prophet, apostate Prot-
                     estantism, has also been established. The question is, who is
                     the dragon? In Revelation 12:9 he is called "the Devil, and
                     Satan." But this archenemy of God and man always works
                     through people or organizations. In the days of the apostles
                     he worked through pagan Rome. In these closing days the
                     dragon who makes war upon God's remnant (Rev. 12:17) could
                     well represent the great anti-God movement, which, backed
                     up by spirit powers, is determined to obliterate God's name
                     from the earth. In fulfillment of this prophecy we see spir-
                     itualism working through all these great movements. In fact
                     spiritualism may come to be the foundation of popular religion.
                        How much of the world is being prepared for the battle
                     of the great day of God? Verse 14.
                         "Thus, before the spirits can have such absolute authority
                     over the race as to gather them to battle against the King of
                     kings and Lord of lords, they must first win their way among
                     the nations of the earth, and cause their teaching to be re-
                     ceived as of divine authority and their word as law. This work
                     they are now doing, and when they shall have once gained
                     full influence over the nations in question, what fitter instru-
                     ment could be employed to gather them to so rash and hope-

    THE SEVENTH
         PLAGUE       The seventh plague is the last tragic judgment of the series.
                   While some of the plagues will be local, the last one is poured
                   out into the air. The atmosphere all over the habitable globe
                   will be affected. But not for long, for the great voice of God
                   declares, "It is done."

                      From whence does that voice speak? Verse 17.

                      The gathering of the nations took place under the sixth
                   plague. Now the real battle begins, and God uses His armory.

                      What other events occur at this time? Verse 18.

                      What did the Lord reveal to Job about snow and hail?
                   Job 38:22, 23.

                      God has reserved snow and hail for "the day of battle
                   and war." And He will cause an "overflowing scourge" to pass
                   through the lands of earth. But His people will be delivered,
                   "every one that shall be found written in the book." Dan 12:1.

                       What message in the Psalms expresses the attitude of God's
                   faithful ones amid the reeling earth? Ps. 46:1.

                      This whole psalm, like Psalm 91, contains a message espe-
                   cially appropriate for "the time of trouble," and in the midst
                   of worldwide distress God's faithful ones will be heard singing
                   those words in triumph. See The Great Controversy, page 639.

    The seventeenth chapter of Revelation has been interpreted in a variety of
ways, and Seventh-day Adventists are not all agreed on one interpretation.
Some who study this lesson will see the prophecy in a different way from that
presented here. However, while the interpretation of details may vary, the main
thrust of the prophecy is given by Ellen G. White in the following quotation:
    "In the seventeenth of Revelation is foretold the destruction of all the
churches who corrupt themselves by idolatrous devotion to the service of the
papacy, those who have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication. [Rev.
17:1-4 quoted.]
    "Thus is represented the papal power, which with all deceivableness of un-
righteousness, by outside attraction and gorgeous display, deceives all nations;
promising them, as did Satan our first parents, all good to those, who receive
its mark, and all harm to those who oppose its fallacies. The power which has
the deepest inward corruption will make the greatest display, and will clothe
itself with the most elaborate signs of power. The Bible plainly declares that
this covers a corrupt and deceiving wickedness. 'Upon her forehead was a
name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS
AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.'
    "What is it that gives its kingdom to this power? Protestantism, a power
 which, while professing to have the temper and spirit of a Iamb and to be allied
 to Heaven, speaks with the voice of a dragon. It is moved by a power from
beneath."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 7, p. 983.

           Part 1       "And there came one of the seven angels which had the
      THE UNHOLY    seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither;
                    I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that
          WOMAN     sitteth upon many waters: with whom the kings of the earth
                    have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth
                    have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication. So
                    he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I
                    saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names
                    of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns." Rev.
                    17:1-3.
                        Who unfolded this symbolic prophecy to John? Verse 1.
                        A woman in prophecy represents a church. This evil woman
                    is therefore the symbol of an apostate church. Throughout our
                    history Adventists, as did the great Protestant Reformers before
                    us, have applied this prophecy to the papacy. But it includes
                    more than one religious organization. Verse 18 states that she
                    represents the great city, and 16:18, 19 identifies the great city
                    as Babylon. Thus the scarlet woman represents all apostate
                    religion.
                        Where was John carried in spirit? Verse 3.
                       The New English Bible reads, "he carried me away into
                    the wilds." From the viewpoint of the judgment (see verse 1)
                    he saw the scarlet woman. When the angel described her in
                    verse 1 he said she was seated "upon many waters," but when
                    John saw her judgment she was seated on a scarlet beast
                    which corresponds in general with the dragon of Revelation 12
                    and the beast of Revelation 13. To human appearance she was
                    supported by earth's population, but behind this facade she was
                    seen supported by the devil.
                       What did John note particularly about this beast? Verse 3.
                       The dragon of chapter 12 had seven crowned heads and ten
                    horns; and the leopard-beast of chapter 13 had seven heads
                    and ten crowned horns; the beast of chapter 17 had also seven
                    heads and ten horns but there is no mention of crowns. At
                    the time to which this prophecy points the world empires
                    are past, for there are no crowns, or power symbols, on the
                    heads. The nations of Europe are not the source of power, for
                    the ten horns are uncrowned. The woman is the manifestation
                    of dragon power in the world at the time of fulfillment of this
                    prophecy. She has replaced the crowned heads and horns of
                    the past. This fact points to a new kind of power structure not
                    appropriately represented by crowns. From another vantage
                    point this beast of chapter 17 is seen as the image to the beast
                    in Revelation 13.
 THINK IT THROUGH       What is the significance of each feature of this prophecy
                    for these last days?

           Part 2      "And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour,
    THE BLOOD OF    and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having
                    a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness
    THE MARTYRS
                    of her fornication: and upon her forehead was a name writ-
                    ten, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HAR-
                    LOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH. And I saw the
                    woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the
                    blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I won-
                    dered with great admiration." Rev. 17:4-6.

                       It was "the blood of the martyrs of Jesus" that intoxicated
                    this seductive infamous woman representing religious apostasy
                    in the world. Yet John also realized that what sustained the
                    martyrs in the hour of death was the blood of the Lamb. They
                    therefore were honored to shed their blood for Him.

                       How was the woman dressed? Verse 4.

                       Purple and scarlet are considered royal colors. But they
                    could also be the colors of sin and spiritual prostitution. The
                    golden cup pictured in the woman's hand is "full of abomina-
                    tions and filthiness of her fornication." This is strong language.
                    But God wants us to realize how He regards the corruption of
                    the gospel message as well as the illicit relationship of the
                    church with the world.

                       What was the name on her forehead? Verse 5. What is
                    the significance of this name?

                       What does the woman hold in her hand? Verse 4.

                       This is a cup full of abomination and counterfeit doctrines
                    of a false priesthood. How tragic that the simple way of salva-
                    tion should be so corrupted as to require the services of a
                    man-made priest to absolve the sinner.

 THINK IT THROUGH      In what ways can I help those in the darkness of ignorance
                    and superstition while there is yet a time of grace?

                       "The men of Babel had determined to establish a govern-
                    ment that should be independent of God. . . . Had they gone
                    on unchecked, they would have demoralized the world in its

            Part 3      "And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou mar-
                     vel? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the
       THE WORLD
                     beast that carrieth her, which hash the seven heads and ten
      ASTONISHED     horns. The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall
                     ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and
                     they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were
                     not written in the book of life from the foundation of the
                     world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and
                     yet is." Rev. 17:7, 8.
                        When the people of the world discern this beast arising with
                     new and added power, they are amazed. The only ones un-
                     moved are those whose names are written in the book of life.
                     Through the study of God's prophetic Word they have known
                     what to expect in these last days. Prophecy is indeed "a light
                     that shineth in a dark place." 2 Peter 1:19.
                        From whence does the beast of Revelation 17 arise?
                     Verse 8.
                        The beast of chapter 13 arose out of the sea, which repre-
                     sented peoples and warring nations. But after exercising its
                     power for 1,260 years from A.D. 538 to 1798 it suffered a death-
                     stroke. The prophecy indicates that he will come back into
                     power, at which time all the world will wonder after him. Rev.
                     13:3. The scarlet beast of Revelation 17 symbolizes the same
                     power but the prophet is viewing it at a different time—after it
                     has recovered from the "deadly wound." When it reappears it
                     comes, not from the sea but from the "bottomless pit." The
                     Greek word abussos, translated "bottomless pit," means an
                     abyss. In Romans 10:7 it means the place of the dead.
                        Will that influence and control continue? Verse 10.
                        Prophecy declares it will be a "short space," but long
                     enough to deceive the whole world except those whose names
                     are written in the book of life.
 THINK IT THROUGH       "Is my name written there?"
                         No more pertinent question can be asked. For only those
                     whose names are written there will escape the delusions of the
                     devil and stand without fear in the presence of our Lord when
                     He returns.
                         "While these messages have been studied with profit and
                     inspiration throughout the centuries, they have their special
                     application to earth's last generation. Through the study of His
                     word, the Lord by His Spirit is preparing a people to stand
                     through the final days of deception and be ready for the ap-
                     pearing of our Lord. The prophet was, therefore, witnessing

                        There must be real significance in twice mentioning the
                    beast that "was," "is not," and "yet is." History records the
                    power that "was"; it reigned for 1,260 years, during which time
                    the saints were persecuted and attempted changes were made
                    in God's law. Dan. 7:25; Rev. 13:5-7. But the power which had
                    been killing with the sword of the state, received by the sword
                    of the state a deathstroke in 1798 and for a time appeared
                    dead. Some declare that this is the "is not" period. The papacy
                    had no civil power after 1798. But looking beyond that time
                    John sees a "yet is" period when civil power will be regained
                    and all the world will wonder after the beast. Rev. 13:3.
                        A portion of the prophecy studied today is yet unfulfilled.
                    "It is never wise to be dogmatic when studying unfulfilled
                    prophecies. A Biblical principle is clear; Jesus said, 'I have
                    told you before it come to pass that, when it is come to pass,
                    ye might believe.' John 14:29. The unfolding of events will
                    doubtless clarify many of these difficult passages.
                        "During the last century the Church of Rome has been re-
                    gaining her political influence until today she is strong once
                    more."—R. A. Anderson Unfolding the Revelation, pages 174,
                    175.
                        What are we counseled to do in regard to these events?
                    Rev. 16:15; Luke 12:37.

 THINK IT THROUGH       Are we watching world events in the light of prophecy as
                    diligently as did our early pioneers? If things were to close
                    up suddenly, would I be caught unaware?
                       "The attitude of watching is to designate the church as
                    God's people indeed. By this sign the waiting ones are distin-
                    guished from the world and show that they are pilgrims and
                    strangers upon the earth."—Testimonies, Vol. 2, p. 205.

                                                                         August 15

            Part 5      "And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which
     THE FAITHFUL    have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings
                     one hour with the beast. These have one mind, and shall give
         REMNANT     their power and strength unto the beast. These shall make
                     war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for
                     he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with
                     him are called, and chosen, and faithful." Rev. 17:12-14.



                         The ten kings receive their authority by giving their author-
                     ity to the beast and receiving it back again. Ellen G. White
                     identified this power as Protestantism. See introduction. They
                     had religious authority. When they receive it back under the
                     beast, they have political authority. The authority which at first
                     was only religious is given back as governmental authority.

                        When the horns finally unite, what is said of their mind?
                     Verse 13.



                         These have not the mind of Christ but the mind of Satan
                     as they band together. Ellen G. White comments: "There will be
                     a universal bond of union, one great harmony, a confederacy
                     of Satan's forces. . . .
                         "In the warfare to be waged in the last days there will be
                     united, in opposition to God's people, all the corrupt powers
                     that have apostatized from allegiance to the law of Jehovah."

                     p. 983.
                         If we wonder how it is possible for the nations to be de-
                     ceived, note these inspired words: "The power of Satan now
                     to tempt and deceive is ten-fold greater than it was in the
                     days of the apostles."—Spiritual Gifts, Vol. 2, p. 277.


                       When the forces of evil finally unite, upon whom do they
                     wage war? Who will win? Verse 14.




THINK IT THROUGH        "The so-called Christian world is to be the theatre of great
                     and decisive actions. Men in authority will enact laws con-
                     trolling the conscience, after the example of the papacy.
                     Babylon will make all nations drink of the wine of the wrath
                     of her fornication. Every nation will be involved."—Ellen G.

                                                                        August 16

             Part 6    "And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest,
  WHEN THE WORLD where the whore sitteth are peoples, and multitudes, and
                    nations, and tongues. And the ten horns which thou sawest
FULFILLS GOD'S WILL upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make
                    her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn
                    her with fire. For God hath put in their hearts to fulfill his
                    will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast,
                    until the words of God shall be fulfilled. And the woman
                    which thou sawest is that great city, which reigneth over the
                    kings of the earth." Rev. 17:15-18.
                       What does prophecy declare will happen to the woman?
                    Verse 16.
                       These last verses of chapter 17 picture a strange reversal
                    of all that the previous verses seemed to be leading up to:
                    verse 14 forecasts a bitter attack upon the Lamb and His fol-
                    lowers by Satan's confederacy of evil. But verse 16 shows that
                    the very powers that gave their strength and support to the
                    woman will eventually turn on her and savagely destroy her,
                    burning her with fire.
                       What result of men's anger, pointed out by the psalmist,
                    will occur again? Ps. 76:10.
                       In 1798 it was the beast that suffered the "deadly wound."
                    The political power was stripped from the papacy; but the
                    woman, the church, continued on as a religious power. Slowly
                    the church began to rebuild her political power, until in this
                    prophecy she is seen riding the beast.
                        What does this prophecy say is her relationship to the
                    kings or the dictators of earth? Verse 18.
                       This portrays a global combination. It will include all the
                    powers of earth, and under the influence of the woman they will
                    form a confederacy against the apparently helpless people of
                    God. But these very powers will turn upon the woman and
                    destroy her.
                       What is the nature of the daughters that spring from this
                    adulterous "mother"? Verse 5.
                       The daughters of the apostate church actually form the
                    -image to the beast of chapter 13:14.
 THINK IT THROUGH      Am I able to discern the antichrist influences that threaten
                    the church in both education and religion?
                        The false science of the present day, which undermines
                    faith in the Bible, will prove as successful in preparing the way
                    for the acceptance of the papacy, with its pleasing forms, as
                    did the withholding of knowledge in opening the way for its
                    aggrandizement in the Dark Ages."—The Great Controversy,

     of Babylon
   "The proclamation of the gospel is the only means in which God can employ
human beings as His instrumentalities for the salvation of souls. As men, women,
and children proclaim the gospel, the Lord will open the eyes of the blind to
see His statutes and will write upon the hearts of the truly penitent His law. The
animating Spirit of God, working through human agencies, leads the believers
to be of one mind, one soul, unitedly loving God and keeping His command-
ments—preparing here below for translation....
   "As the members of the body of Christ approach the period of their last con-
flict, 'the time of Jacob's trouble,' they will grow up into Christ, and will partake
largely of His Spirit."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol.

            Part 1      "And after these things I saw another angel come down
THE LIGHTED EARTH    from heaven, having great power; and the earth was light-
                     ened with his glory. And he cried mightily with a strong voice,
                     saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become
                     the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and
                     a cage of every unclean and hateful bird. For all nations have
                     drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the
                     kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and
                     the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abun-
                     dance of her delicacies." Rev. 18:1-3.
                        Chapter 18 portrays graphically the climax of human history.
                     In true apocalyptic style we have a brief introduction followed
                     by an impressive description of how things will end.
                        What was the result of this other angel which comes down
                     from heaven? Verse 1.
                        The threefold message, given by the three angels in chapter
                     14, continues to gain in strength right up to the appearing of
                     our Lord in the clouds. Rev. 14:14. But a new impetus is given
                     by this angel who comes from heaven with great power lighting
                     the world with splendor.
                        "It is an awful hour when a world's destiny is to be decided
                     —a most solemn crisis when an entire contemporaneous gen-
                     eration of the human family is to pass the bounds of probation,
                     as the last note of mercy is sounded."—Uriah Smith, Daniel
                     and the Revelation, page 724.
                       What mighty announcement does he bring and how is the
                     message delivered? Verse 2.
                         This is the same message as that of the second angel (Rev.
                     14:8), but it is even more specific: Not only is spiritual Babylon
                     fallen after intoxicating the nations with the wine of her false
                     doctrines, but she has become "a dwelling place of demons"
                     and "a haunt of every foul and hateful bird." Rev. 18:2, RSV.
                     Paganism has always been a false religion, but the papacy is
                     an apostate one. Included in this Babylon is also the false
                     prophet or apostate Protestantism.
THINK IT THROUGH       How can I prepare to participate in lighting the earth with
                     God's glory?
                        "During the loud cry, the church, aided by the providential
                     interpositions of her exalted Lord, will diffuse the knowledge
                     of salvation so abundantly that light will be communicated to
                     every city and town. The earth will be filled with the knowl-
                     edge of salvation. So abundantly will the renewing Spirit of
                     God have crowned with success the intensely active agencies,
                     that the light of present truth will be seen flashing everywhere."

           Part 2       "And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come
   ANOTHER VOICE    out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins,
                    and that ye receive not of her plagues. For her sins have
  SAYING, "COME"    reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniq-
                    uities." Rev. 18:4, 5.
                       Where did this other voice come from which John heard?
                    Verse 4.
                        This voice from heaven is called "another" voice, showing
                    that a new agency is here introduced. We now have five celes-
                    tial messengers expressly mentioned as engaged in this last
                    religious reformation. These are the first, second, and third
                    angels of Revelation 14; fourth, the angel of verse 1 of this
                    chapter; and fifth the agency indicated by the "voice" of
                    verse 4, now before us.
                       To whom is the message of this chapter especially directed?
                    Verse 4.
                       "Men of faith and prayer will be constrained to go forth with
                    holy zeal, declaring the words which God gives them. The sins
                    of Babylon will be laid open. The fearful results of enforcing
                    the observances of the church by civil authority, the inroads
                    of spiritualism, the stealthy but rapid progress of the papal
                    power—all will be unmasked. By these solemn warnings the
                    people will be stirred. Thousands upon thousands will listen
                    who have never heard words like these. In amazement they
                    hear the testimony that Babylon is the church, fallen because
                    of her errors and sins, because of her rejection of the truth
                    sent to her from heaven."—The Great Controversy, pages 606,
                    607.
                       How far have the sins of Babylon reached? Verse 5.
                       The ancient Babel builders were attempting to erect a tower
                    whose top was to "reach unto heaven." Gen. 11:4. Modern
                    Babylon will not construct an architectural monstrosity but she
                    will challenge God by the rejection of His law.
 THINK IT THROUGH      How can I better cooperate with heavenly agencies in
                    doing God's work?
                       "The prophecies in the eighteenth of Revelation will soon
                    be fulfilled. During the proclamation of the third angel's mes-
                    sage, 'another angel' is to 'come down from heaven, having
                    great power,' and the earth is to be 'lightened with his glory.'
                    The Spirit of the Lord will so graciously bless consecrated

Exodus From Babylon LESSON 8                                            ❑ Tuesday
                                                                         August 20

             Part 3       "Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and
     WHEN APOSTASY    mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with
                      fire: for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her. And the
     CLAIMS TO BE A   kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived
             QUEEN    deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her,
                      when they shall see the smoke of her burning." Rev. 18:8, 9.
                         Read Revelation 18:7-11.
                         This chapter describes events after the beast-power has
                      come to life again. We are not informed how much time will
                      elapse between the healing of the wound and the proclamation
                      of the woman, or the church, that she is no longer a widow.
                      The Scripture speaks of it as a "short space."
                         How long will the plagues last? Verse 8.
                         This may be a prophetic day (or a literal year) for it speaks
                      of "death, and mourning, and famine." A day of twenty-four
                      hours could not produce a famine. In Isaiah 34:8 the prophet
                      speaks of "the day of the Lord's vengeance, and the year of
                      recompenses for the controversy of Zion." Or it could refer to
                      a short time, without a specific length intended.
                         What will be the reaction of the kings with whom the
                      church has been in illicit relation when they see the destruc-
                      tion of their great organization? Verse 9.
                         Spiritual Babylon is not an actual city, but her destruction
                      is pictured as a burning city. Four times we find the expression
                      "one hour" associated with Babylon's reign and destruction.
                      For just "one hour" the powers of the world reign with her
                      (Rev. 17:12); in "one hour" her judgment comes (Rev. 18:10);
                      in "one hour" her riches come to naught (v. 17); in "one hour"
                      she is made desolate (v. 19). Thus is indicated a very rapidly
                      moving chain of events. As the defiant Babel builders of old
                      were thwarted in their enterprise and scattered, so also will
                      this modern Babylonian project collapse and its builders will
                      cry for the mountains to hide them when our Saviour appears
                      in glory, coming for His people.
THINK IT THROUGH         Entrance into God's kingdom of glory is promised, not to
                      the successful but to the faithful. Our Lord will say, "Well
                      done, good and faithful servant." As I examine my faithful-
                      ness, where should I improve?
                         "The time of test is just upon us, for the loud cry of the
                      third angel has already begun in the revelation of the righ-
                      teousness of Christ, the sin-pardoning Redeemer. This is the
                      beginning of the light of the angel Whose glory shall fill the
                      whole earth."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Com-

Exodus From Babylon        LESSON 8                               ❑ Wednesday
                                                                     August 21

           Part 4      "And the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed
    THE COLLAPSE    from thee, and all things which were dainty and goodly are
                    departed from thee, and thou shalt find them no more at all.
      OF BABYLON    The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her,
                    shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and
                    wailing." Rev. 18:14, 15.
                       Read Revelation 18:12-19.
                       In these verses is pictured the sudden destruction of apos-
                    tate religion. This will be a terrible shock to these modern
                    Babel builders. The mourners recall their grandiose plans and
                    their quick-growing profits. Now all is gone.
                       How many different classes of merchants are mentioned?
                    Verses 12-14, 17.
                       What is their reaction? Verses 15, 19.
                       International trade, which promised so much, has suddenly
                    come to an end because of the judgments of God. It is not
                    that God takes pleasure in the destruction of sinners, for He is
                    "not willing that any should perish, but that all should come
                    to repentance." 2 Peter 3:9. But Babylon's great sin is her
                    defiance of God and her determination to enforce her religion
                    and her mark on all, regardless of their conscientious beliefs.
                    A death decree will be passed upon God's remnant. When the
                    situation reaches that point, God becomes the Deliverer of His
                    people. The plagues, mentioned in verse 8, begin to fall, and
                    commerce collapses.
                       What is God's earnest appeal just before the plagues are
                    poured out? Verse 4.
                      God's people are found everywhere, in every nation, denomi-
                    nation, and religion. They are living up to all the light they
                    have. To them God makes this last appeal. It is to prepare men
                    and women to make the right stand in the final crisis that the
                    advent message has been raised up.

 THINK IT THROUGH     How can I sense more fully the importance of these times
                    and the bigness of the issues before us?
                       "As God called the children of Israel out of Egypt, that they
                    might keep His Sabbath, so He calls His people out of Babylon,
                    that they may not worship the beast or his image. The man
                    of sin, who thought to change times and laws, has exalted
                    himself above God, by presenting a spurious sabbath to the
                    world; the Christian world has accepted the child of the papacy,
                    and cradled and nourished it, thus defying God by removing
                    His memorial, and setting up a rival sabbath."—Ellen G. White

                                                                                 67
Exodus From Babylon LESSON 8                                           ❑ Thursday
                                                                         August 22

             Part 5      "And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone
     BABYLON SINKS    and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that
                      great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no
                      more at all." Rev. 18:21.

                         Read also verses 22, 23.

                         What striking figure is used to show the complete destruc-
                      tion of modern Babylon? Verse 21.

                         In what other circumstances was this illustration used?
                      Jer. 51:60-64.

                         As we have already noticed, the downfall of ancient Baby-
                      lon, and even the words of the prophet Jeremiah, are used by
                      the prophet John to describe the final collapse of man's great-
                      est and final achievement—the organization of a world govern-
                      ment. Many statesmen believe world government to be the solu-
                      tion to world war. Such a project would link together all
                      commerce, industry, finance, and religion. This, they say,
                      would control all human endeavor and ensure human success.
                      To make the idea appealing it might well done in the name
                      of Christianity.
                         What did the angel say as he cast the great stone into the
                      sea? Verse 21.

                         This dramatic act by the angel in John's vision must have
                      deeply impressed the prophet. No other passage in Scripture
                      is more descriptive than this eighteenth chapter.
                         Like a huge millstone dropped into the sea, Babylon will
                      sink never to rise again. And all who have put their trust in
                      her will also perish. "Come out of her my people" is God's
                      urgent appeal.

THINK IT THROUGH         What ties still keep me from coming fully out of Babylon?

                         "As the members of the body of Christ approach the period
                      of their last conflict, 'the time of Jacob's trouble,' they will
                      grow up into Christ, and will partake largely of His Spirit. As
                      the third message swells to a loud cry, and as great power and
                      glory attend the closing work, the faithful people of God will
                      partake of that glory. It is the latter rain which revives and
                      strengthens them to pass through the time of trouble. Their
                      faces will shine with the glory of that light which attends the
                      third angel."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commen-

Exodus From Babylon         LESSON 8                                      ❑ Friday
                                                                          August 23

           Part 6      "Thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by
     ALL NATIONS    thy sorceries were all nations deceived. And in her was found
                    the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were
        DECEIVED    slain upon the earth." Rev. 18:23, 24.

                       Among the sins charged to Babylon, sorcery, or witchcraft,
                    seems to be her leading crime. When God brought Israel out
                    of Egypt, it was to deliver them not only from slavery but also
                    from the occultism and sorcery of that land.
                       By what power will the nations be brought into unity and
                    led on to Armageddon? Rev. 16:13-16.

                       What did the apostle Paul declare the nations would be
                    saying just before Christ's return? 1 Thess. 5:2, 3.

                       While the nations will be talking peace, they will actually be
                    preparing for war. They will be making more diabolical wea-
                    pons of war. See Joel 3:9, 10. Spirits of devils working miracles
                    are instigating a program that will lead the nations to their
                    doom. Spiritualists declare they are "lifting civilization into the
                    Christ-age" and will "usher in the millennium." In Revelation
                    chapters 13 to 18 we are given a preview of the pageant when
                    the whole world will unite against God. But it will end in utter
                    defeat. Five times in chapter 18 we read "no more at all."
                    Verses 21-23. With civilization facing immense problems—the
                    threat of annihilation by nuclear power, world-wide violence,
                    famine, and perhaps others as yet unrecognized—it will be
                    natural for those not knowing God's Word to laud any plan
                    that promises to enhance the morality of society, to provide for
                    human needs, and to bring about worldwide peace.

 THINK IT THROUGH      If an outstanding leader were to appear claiming to bring
                    universal peace and at the same time healing the sick and
                    and working unbelievable miracles, how would I determine
                    whether or not I should support him?

                        "Fearful sights of a supernatural character will soon be re-
                    vealed in the heavens, in token of the power of miracle-work-
                    ing demons. The spirits of devils will go forth to the kings of
                    the earth and to the whole world, to fasten them in deception,
                    and urge them on to unite with Satan in his last struggle against
                    the government of heaven. By these agencies, rulers and sub-
                     jects will be alike deceived. Persons will arise pretending to be
                    Christ Himself, and claiming the title and worship which be-
                    long to the world's Redeemer. They will perform wonderful
                    miracles of healing and will profess to have revelations from
                    heaven contradicting the testimony of the Scriptures."—The

   "And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed
are they which are called unto the mar-
riage supper of the Lamb. And he saith
unto me, These are the true sayings of
God. Rev. 19:9.

   "In this life we can only begin to un-
derstand the wonderful theme of re-
demption. With our finite comprehension
we may consider most earnestly the
shame and the glory, the life and the
death, the justice and the mercy, that
meet in the cross; yet with the utmost
stretch of our mental powers we fail to
grasp its full significance. The length
and the breadth, the depth and the
height, of redeeming love are but dimly
comprehended. The plan of redemption
will not be fully understood, even when
the ransomed see as they are seen and
know as they are known; but through
the eternal ages new truth will contin-
ually unfold to the wondering and de-
lighted mind. Though the griefs and
pains and temptations of earth are ended
and the cause removed, the people of
God will ever have a distinct, intelligent
knowledge of what their salvation has
cost."—The Great Controversy, page

           Part 1       "And after these things I heard a great voice of much
  THE TRIUMPHANT    people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and
                    honour, and power, unto the lord our God: for true and
          CHORUS    righteous are his judgments: for he hath judged the great
                    whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and
                    hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand." Rev.
                    19:1, 2.
                       With the great system of evil and deception overthrown and
                    boastful Babylon now a desolation, the saints are about to re-
                    ceive their reward. So they lift their voices in this mighty
                    "Hallelujah Chorus."
                        What was the theme of the song John heard sung by the
                    multitude in heaven? Verses 1, 2.
                       When the prophet Daniel in vision was looking just beyond
                    our own day, his words of victory were: "The time came that
                    the saints possessed the kingdom." Dan. 7:22. But the great
                    usurper must first be dispossessed. Anticipating that, the saints
                    shout, "Alleluia; Salvation, and glory and honour, and power,
                    unto the Lord our God." Rev. 19:1. Three more times the
                    "Alleluia" appears in verses 2-6.
                        Who confirmed the song of the multitude? Verse 4.
                        "When the earthly warfare is accomplished, and the saints
                    are all gathered home, our first theme will be the song of
                    Moses, the servant of God. The second theme will be the song
                    of the Lamb, the song of grace and redemption. This song will
                    be louder, loftier, and in sublimer strains, echoing and reecho-
                    ing through the heavenly courts. Thus the song of God's provi-
                    dence is sung, connecting the varying dispensations; for all is
                    now seen without a veil between the legal, the prophetical,
                    and the gospel. The church history upon the earth and the
                    church redeemed in heaven all center around the cross of
                    Calvary. This is the theme, this is the song,—Christ all and in
                    all,—in anthems of praise resounding through heaven from
                    thousands and ten thousand times ten thousand and an in-
                    numerable company of the redeemed host. All unite in this
                    song of Moses and of the Lamb. It is a new song, for it was
                    never before sung in heaven."—Testimonies to Ministers, page
                    433.
 THINK IT THROUGH       The song we will sing then is the story of our experience
                    here. In what ways is my life hindering preparation for sing-
                    ing that song of deliverance and redemption?
                        "Let all your powers be directed to pointing souls, confused,
                    bewildered, lost, to 'the Lamb of God.' Lift Him up, the risen
                    Saviour, and say to all who hear, Come to Him who 'hath loved
                    us, and hath given Himself for us.' Let the science of salva-
                    tion be the burden of every sermon, the theme of every song."

The Marriage Supper         LESSON 9                                    ❑ Monday
                                                                         August 26

            Part 2      "Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for
  THE BRIDEGROOM     the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made
                     herself ready. And to her was granted that she should be
    AND THE BRIDE
                     arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is
                     the righteousness of saints." Rev. 19:7, 8.

                        For what does God call His servants to rejoice? Verse 7.

                         "Many are the allusions to this marriage supper in the New
                     Testament. It is referred to in the parable of the marriage of
                     the king's son (Matthew 22:1-14), and again in Luke 14:16-24.
                     It is the time when we shall eat bread in the kingdom of God
                     when we are recompensed at the resurrection of the just. (Luke
                     14:12-15.) It is the time when we shall drink of the fruit of the
                     vine with our Redeemer in His heavenly kingdom. (Matthew
                     26:29; Mark 14:25; Luke 22:18.) It is the time when we shall
                     sit at His table in the kingdom (Luke 22:30), and He will gird
                     Himself, and come forth and serve us (Luke 12:37). Blessed
                     indeed are they who have the privilege of partaking of this
                     glorious feast."—Uriah Smith, Daniel and the Revelation, page
                     734.
                        What did John hear the multitude saying about the Lamb's
                     wife? Verse 7.

                       In what color raiment did John see the wife clothed, and
                     why? Verse 8.
                        What is represented by the bride? Rev. 21:9, 10.

                       In 2 Corinthians 11:2, Paul symbolized the church as a bride.
                     But a city without inhabitants is nothing more than a group of
                     buildings and streets. It is the people in the city that make it
                     what it is. Thus the bride is the New Jerusalem.
                        When God called Israel as a nation, what figure did He
                     use? Hosea 2:19.

 THINK IT THROUGH        What do the symbols of Jesus as groom, city as bride, and
                     marriage supper at His advent teach about the relationship
                     of Jesus and the redeemed?

                        "Only the covering which Christ Himself has provided can
                     make us meet to appear in God's presence. This covering, the
                     robe of His own righteousness, Christ will put upon every re-
                     penting, believing soul....
                        "This robe, woven in the loom of heaven, has in it not one
                     thread of human devising. Christ in His humanity wrought out
                     a perfect character, and this charatcer He offers to impart to
                     us."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 311.

The Marriage Supper LESSON 9                                           ❑ Tuesday
                                                                        August 27

            Part 3      "And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are
        CALLED TO    called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith
                     unto me, These are the true sayings of God. And I fell at his
     THE MARRIAGE    feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See thou do it
           SUPPER    not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren that have
                     the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of
                     Jesus is the spirit of prophecy." Rev. 19:9, 10.

                        What did the angel say of those called to the marriage
                     supper? Verse 9.

                        Why did the multitude rejoice? Verse 7.

                         Jesus said, "I go to prepare a place for you." That place
                     is the Holy City. Abraham "looked for a city ... , whose builder
                     and maker is God." Heb. 11:10. The Holy City will be the
                     metropolis of the new earth to which the redeemed of all the
                     ages will come to worship God "from one sabbath to another."
                     Isa. 66:23.

                        When the angel finished speaking, what did John do?
                     Verse 10 (first part).

                         The prophet was enraptured and overwhelmed. We are told:
                     "The countenance of the angel grew radiant with joy and was
                     exceeding glorious, as he showed John the final triumph of the
                     church of God. . . . He [the apostle] was carried away with
                     the glory of the scene and with deep reverence and in awe
                     fell at the feet of the angel to worship him."—Early Writings,
                     pages 230, 231.

                        How did the angel react to John's attempt to worship him?
                     Verse 10 (last part).

                         We are strictly counseled against the worshiping of angels.
                     See Col. 2:18. The gentle reproof given to John clearly reveals
                     the reason human beings are not to worship angels. He said,
                     "I am thy fellowservant." He had also served John's brethren,
                     the prophets. He was not divine, but a servant of God.

                        What did the angel say is the testimony of Jesus? Verse
                     10 (last part).

                        The spirit of prophecy means that Jesus is witnessing to
                     His church through the gift of prophecy.

 THINK IT THROUGH       To what extent is the testimony of Jesus, or the spirit of
                     prophecy, molding my life? Am I reading His counsel as
                     much as I should?

The Marriage Supper       LESSON 9                                ❑   Wednesday
                                                                       August 28

          Part 4        "And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse;
  THE CONQUEROR     and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and
                    in righteousness he doth judge and make war. His eyes were
          COMES     as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and
                    he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.
                    And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his
                    name is called The Word of God." Rev. 19: 11-13.
                       What happened to the heavens when John beheld this
                    scene? What color was the horse? Verse 11.
                       White horses, white linen, white robes all speak of Christ's
                    righteousness. See verse 8. It is in righteousness that He leads
                    forth the armies of heaven to war against all the united forces
                    of evil. We could say that this is the real battle of the great
                    day of God. "Spirits of devils, working miracles" have com-
                    bined the whole world in a determined effort to blot out the
                    name of God and the people of God. Can we imagine the effect
                    on the deluded masses when they see the Saviour in His maj-
                    esty leading the hosts of light as a conquering army?
                       How is the head of this conquering King adorned? Verse
                    12.
                       When John saw Him coming in power, how was He
                    clothed? Verse 13.
                       What Old Testament scripture gives the same picture?
                    Isa. 63:1-3.
                       When the One who was sacrified on Calvary comes in glory
                    to rout the enemy of God and man, He will bear on His person
                    a bloodstained robe, the receipt of the price He paid for our
                    redemption. In Gethsemane and on Calvary He trod the wine-
                    press alone. When He comes a glorious King, His foes will still
                    be out of harmony with Him in character.

 THINK IT THROUGH      How can Jesus be my King? Am I on His side in the com-
                    bat with evil?
                        "The battle of Armageddon is soon to be fought. He on
                    whose vesture is written the name, King of kings and Lord of
                    lords, leads forth the armies of heaven on white horses, clothed
                    in fine linen, clean and white. . . .
                        "All the world will be on one side or the other of the ques-
                    tion. The battle of Armageddon will be fought, and that day
                    must find none of us sleeping. ...
                       "The power of the Holy Ghost must be upon us, and the
                    Captain of the Lord's host will stand at the head of the angels
                    of heaven to direct the battle."—Ellen G. White Comments,

           Part 5      "And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried
      THE SECOND    with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst
                    of heaven, Come and gather yourselves together unto the
          SUPPER    supper of the great God; that ye may eat the flesh of kings,
                    and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and
                    the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the
                    flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great."
                    Rev. 19:17, 18.

                       Notice here the contrast to the marriage supper of joy and
                    gladness where the righteous of all the ages assemble in the
                    Father's presence to celebrate the victory of the Lamb, and
                    where He comes forth to serve us. Verse 9. This is a different,
                    a tragic supper when the birds of prey gather to feast on the
                    flesh of kings and captains and all who have refused the in-
                    vitations to the marriage supper of the Lamb and continued
                    in their worldly way of life.

                        What does the apostle Paul state to be the punishment of
                    those who are unprepared for our Lord's return? 2 Thess.
                    1: 7-9.

                       The days in which we live must be days of preparation tc
                    meet our Lord in peace. The nations of earth seem to be pre
                    paring for war and bloodshed. But every human being who is
                    alive, whatever his social state, if he has not accepted salva-

                       "We are to see in history the fulfillment of prophecy ... and

           Part 6      "And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and
   THE RIGHTEOUS    their armies, gathered together to make war against him that
                    sat on the horse, and against his army. And the beast was
       PRESERVED    taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles
                    before him, with which he deceived them that had received
                    the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image.
                    These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with
                    brimstone. And the remnant were slain with the sword of him
                    that sat upon the horse, which sword proceeded out of his
                    mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh." Rev.
                    19:19-21.

                        Where were the beast, the false prophet and all the unholy
                    retinue cast? Verse 20.

                       The lake of fire here mentioned is not the final lake of fire
                    at the end of the millenium. In this nineteenth chapter the
                    prophet is discussing events connected with the second advent
                    of Christ, one of which is the fiery destruction of the living
                    wicked. Paul, describing our Lord being "revealed from heaven
                    with his mighty angels," says it will be "in flaming fire taking
                    vengeance on them . . . that obey not the gospel." 2 Thess.

                    will destroy all who have linked themselves with the devil and
                    his angels.
                       Revelation 19:21 in the New English Bible reads: "The rest
                    were killed by the sword which went out of the Rider's mouth";
                    that is, the voice of Christ, who calls the righteous dead to
                    arise.

 THINK IT THROUGH      What will it mean to be alive to see the Saviour coming
                    in all His glory? It will take special preparation to stand
                    unafraid in that tremendous hour.

                       "When He leaves the sanctuary, darkness covers the in-
                    habitants of the earth. In that fearful time the righteous must
                    live in the sight of a holy God without an intercessor. The
                    restraint which has been upon the wicked is removed, and
                    Satan has entire control of the finally impenitent. God's long-
                    suffering has ended. The world has rejected His mercy, de-
                    spised His love, and trampled upon His law. The wicked have
                    passed the boundary of their probation; the Spirit of God, per-
                    sistently resisted, has been at last withdrawn. Unsheltered by
                    divine grace, they have no protection from the wicked one.
                    Satan will then plunge the inhabitants of the earth into one
                    great, final trouble."—The Great Controversy, page 614.

                                  LESSON 10
                               September 1-7


  "Blessed and holy is •he that hath part in
the first resurrection: on such the second
death hath no power, but they shall be priests
of God and of Christ, and shall reign with
him a thousand years." Rev. 20:6.




   It is unfortunate that the word "millennium"
is too often thought of by well-meaning Chris-
tians as a period of prosperity on earth with
Christ reigning as King in old Jerusalem. There
is no Scriptural warrant for such- an interpre-
tation. The word itself simply means a thou-
sand years and nothing more. Any period of
1,000 years is a millennium. Christians gen-
erally agree with the Scriptural prophecy
which clearly states that the devil will be
 bound a thousand years. But where will be
his prison? The Scripture says it will be on
 this earth.
    Seventh-day Adventists, from our very early
 days, have taught that when Jesus returns in
 glory He will destroy the wicked by the bright-
 ness of His coming, while the righteous will be
 either raised from the dead or translated and
 will accompany Christ and His angels back to
 the "Father's house," leaving the earth abso-
 lutely devoid of life—a real prison-house for
 Satan and his rebel angels.

                                                                          September 1

            Part 1       "And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the
 THE DEVIL BOUND     key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. And
                     he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the
                     Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, and cast
                     him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal
                     upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till
                     the thousand years should be fulfilled." Rev. 20:1-3.
                         The history of this little planet, Earth, is the story of a con-
                     flict between two opposing forces—the kingdom of light and
                     truth led by the Son of God and His angels, and the kingdom
                     of darkness and error led by Satan and his angels.
                          What was the third temptation that Satan presented to
                     Jesus in the wilderness? Matt. 4:8-10.
                         It was to bring this little world back into harmony with the
                     universe, and to save mankind from the dominion of the devil,
                     that the Son of God left the glories of heaven, came to this
                     world, lived a sinless life, and died a vicarious death. He did
                     all this to give every human being an opportunity of breaking
                     from the power of Satan, and by grace, becoming a member
                     of the family of God. But the time is coming when the devil
                     will be arrested and, together with his angels and all who
                     follow him, will finally be destroyed.
                          What was in the hand of the angel mentioned in Rev.
                     20:1?
                          What did the angel do with the devil? Verse 2.
                         Satan is a spirit-being, and of course no spirit can be bound
                     by a literal chain. It must therefore be a chain of circumstances.
                     We ourselves use that figure of speech at times, saying, for
                     example, "I cannot come, for I am bound," meaning circum-
                     stances make it impossible to comply with some request. Just
                     so the devil will be bound by a chain of circumstances, every
                     link forged by an event over which neither he nor his angels
                     has any power.
 THINK IT THROUGH         Am I, with Satan, bound to this world, or am I unbound
                     from it and free in Jesus awaiting translation?
                        "For six thousand years the great controversy has been in
                     progress; the Son of God and His heavenly messengers have
                     been in conflict with the power of the evil one, to warn, en-
                     lighten, and save the children of men. Now all have made their
                     decisions; the wicked have fully united with Satan in his war-
                     fare against God. The time has come for God to vindicate the
                     authority of His downtrodden law. Now the controversy is not
                     alone with Satan, but with men. 'The Lord hath a controversy
                     with the nations;' He will give them that are wicked to the
                     sword."—The Great Controversy, page 656.

The Devil's End LESSON 10                                            ❑   Monday
                                                                     September 2

          Part 2       Whom did John see sitting on thrones of judgment and
MARTYRS HONORED     reigning with Christ during the thousand years?


                       "And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judg-
                    ment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that
                    were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word
                    of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his
                    image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads,
                    or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a
                    thousand years. But the rest of the dead lived not again until
                    the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrec-
                    tion. Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resur-
                    rection: on such the second death hath no power, but they
                    shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with
                    him a thousand years." Rev. 20:4-6.

                       Where did the martyrs come from, and how did they get
                    to be living with Christ? Verse 5.

                       What great event marks the second advent of Christ?
                    1 Thess. 4:16.

                       What did Jesus say about the two resurrections? John
                    5:28, 29.


                        "During the thousand years between the first and the second
                    resurrection the judgment of the wicked takes place. The apos-
                    tle Paul points to this judgment as an event that follows the
                    second advent. [1 Cor. 4:5 quoted.] . . . In union with Christ
                    they [the saints] judge the wicked, comparing their acts with
                    the statute book, the Bible, and deciding every case according
                    to the deeds done in the body. Then the portion which the
                    wicked must suffer is meted out, according to their works; and
                    it is recorded against their names in the book of death."—The
                    Great Controversy, pages 660, 661.

 THINK IT THROUGH      Why should saints judge angels?


                       "Jesus comes in a mighty, threefold glory that is beyond
                    our comprehension. No wonder the wicked are unable to look
                    upon Him and live. They will be smitten down as if by an atomic
                    flash. The heat and power of that 'explosion' will be terrific.
                       "This is not some tremendous cosmic catastrophe triggered
                    by man; it is the work of God. And notice, it affects only those
                    who are unable to endure the light of His glory."—H. M. S.

                                                                         September 3

             Part 3      "And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall
        LOOSING OF    be loosed out of his prison. And shall go out to deceive the
                      nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and
         THE DEVIL    Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of
                      whom is as the sand of the sea." Rev. 20:7, 8.
                         What will happen to Satan at the end of the thousand
                      years? Verse 7.
                         What is John's description of the length of Satan's release?
                      Verse 3 (last part).
                         The wording of verse 3 is very revealing. He will deceive
                      the nations no more till the thousand years are expired. Why
                      has he not been able to carry on his work of deception? Simply
                      because the righteous have all been taken from this world to
                      the Father's house, and the wicked have not been raised from
                      the dead.
                          What does Scripture say of those who are raised in the
                      first resurrection? Verse 6.
                         When the earth is depopulated, Satan and his angels will
                      be confined to this planet. There will be no one to tempt and
                      deceive. Satan will not be slain by the brightness of Christ's
                      glory as will be the case with the wicked humans. He will be
                      able to view the tragic results of his rebellion. But how is he
                      loosed? If the destruction of all the living wicked constituted
                      Satan's binding, then the reversal of that will constitute his
                      loosing.
                         What event takes place at the close of the 1,000 years?
                      Verses 12, 13.
                        The resurrected wicked are the ones the devil goes out to
                      deceive and organize into a fighting force. Each one of these
                      could have been a citizen of God's kingdom.

THINK IT THROUGH         The tragedy of billions of lost people made in the image
                      of God! What can I do to help prevent the loss of some?

                         Those who rise from the grave after the thousand years
                      come forth for judgment.
                         "Satan also and evil angels are judged by Christ and His
                      people. Says Paul: 'Know ye not that we shall judge angels?'
                      Verse 3 [of 1 Cor. 6]. And Jude declares that 'the angels
                      which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation,
                      He hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto
                      the judgment of the great day.' Jude 6."—The Great Contro-

                                                                      September 4

            Part 4      "And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and com-
THE DEVIL ATTACKS    passed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city:
                     and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured
                     them." Rev. 20:9.
                         Against what does the devil lead his deceived multitudes
                     at the end of the thousand years? Verse 9.

                        The question naturally arises, Where was "the beloved city"
                     during the millennium? John wrote in Revelation 21:2 that he
                     saw it "coming down from God out of heaven."
                        "As the New Jerusalem, in its dazzling splendor, comes
                     down out of heaven, it rests upon the place purified and made
                     ready to receive it, and Christ, with His people and the angels,
                     enters the Holy City."—The Great Controversy, page 663. The
                     attention of the multitude is again arrested as, high above the
                     city, God unfolds in a panorama the whole history of sin and
                     salvation.
                        "Now Christ again appears to the view of His enemies. Far
                     above the city, upon a foundation of burnished gold, is a throne,
                     high and lifted up. Upon this throne sits the Son of God, and
                     around Him are the subjects of His kingdom. The power and
                     majesty of Christ no language can describe, no pen portray."
                     —The Great Controversy, page 665.
                        "Coming near to the city, the wicked will be able to gaze
                     through its transparent walls of jasper. To their astonishment
                     they will recognize some in that city whom they have despised.
                     But these are inside the city and saved, while they themselves
                     are outside the city and lost."—R. A. Anderson, Unfolding the
                     Revelation, page 197.
                        How did our Lord describe the effect of this scene upon
                     those who merely profess to serve Him? Luke 13:28.

                         This will be the first and last time the whole human race, of
                     all the ages, will meet. What a scene that will be! The effects
                     of sin will be self-evident to the whole universe.

 THINK IT THROUGH       What will be accomplished by the second life of the
                     wicked? Why resurrect them?

                        "Satan seems paralyzed as he beholds the glory and majesty
                     of Christ. He who was once a covering cherub remembers
                     whence he has fallen. A shining seraph, 'son of the morning;'
                     how changed, how degraded! From the council where once he
                     was honored, he is forever excluded. He sees another now

         THE FINAL
                     which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of
         JUDGMENT    those things which were written in the books, according to
                     their works. And the sea gave up the dead which were in 'it;
                     and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in
                     them: and they were judged every man according to their
                     works." Rev. 20:12, 13.
                        What is the source of information for the judgment of the
                     wicked? Verse 12.
                        These closing verses of the twentieth chapter of Revelation
                     present the last acts of rebellion and how God finally disposes
                     of sin and sinners.
                        Twice in Scripture we read "the books were opened." Dan.
                     7:10 and Rev. 20:12. "The following classification appears in
                     GC 480, 481: (1) the book of life, wherein are recorded the
                     names of all those who have accepted the service of God; (2)
                     the book of remembrance, a record of the good deeds of the
                     saints; and (3) a record of the sins of men. In the record of a
                     vision of the executive phase of the judgment at the end of
                     the 1000 years the following classification appears: (1) the
                     book of life, containing a record of the good deeds of the
                     saints; (2) the book of death, containing the record of the evil
                     deeds of the unrepentant, (3) the statute book, the Bible, ac-
                     cording to whose standard men are judged (EW 52)."—SDA
                     Bible Commentary, on Dan. 7:10.
                        "In the books of heaven our lives are as accurately traced
                     as in the picture on the plate of the photographer. Not only are
                     we held accountable for what we have done, but for what we
                     have left undone. We are held to account for our undeveloped
                     characters, our unimproved opportunities."—Ellen G. White
                     Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 7, p. 987.
                        When Jesus returns, what will He bring with Him? Rev.
                     22:12.
                        Some will receive the reward of everlasting life; others will
                     receive everlasting death. Each reward will be the result of the
                     individual's deliberate choice. Those who in the end are finally
                     destroyed in the fires of God are there because of their own
                     choosing. Before that final day of judgment and retribution all
                     will have had opportunity to make the right choice. And each
                     day we are choosing life or death by our thoughts and actions.

 THINK IT THROUGH       What kind of choices am I making day by day? See Deut.

The Devil's End     LESSON 10                                           ❑ Friday
                                                                      September 6

           Part 6       "And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This
 THE CONTROVERSY    is the second death. And whosoever was not found written
                    in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire." Rev. 20:
           ENDED    14, 15.

                       What is this final destruction called? Verse 14.

                       When sin and rebellion finally come to their end, it will also
                    be the end of death itself. We die the first death because of
                    Adam's sin. The Scripture says: "As in Adam all die, even so
                    in Christ shall all be made alive." 1 Cor. 15:22. Only those who
                    are "in Christ" escape the second death. Of those "accounted
                    worthy to obtain that world, [the new earth] and the resurrec-
                    tion," Jesus says, "neither can they die any more." Luke 20:35,
                    36. And Paul says, "The last enemy that shall be destroyed is
                    death." 1 Cor. 15:26.
                      What will Christ, the Judge, have to say to the wicked?
                    Matt. 25:41.

                       "The final scene in the drama of the ages is described in
                    these simple words: 'And fire came down from God out of
                    heaven, and devoured them [the wicked].' Revelation 20:9.
                    This is the 'day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.'
                    2 Peter 3:7. This is the end of the wicked. This is God's great
                    antiseptic that prepares the world for its re-creation. This is
                    the cleansing, purifying fire that fits the earth to be the home
                    of the redeemed. 'And whosoever was not found written in the
                    book of life was cast into the lake of fire.' Rev. 20:15. Those
                    are not human words; they are God's words."—H. M. S. Rich-
                    ards, What Jesus Said, page 549.

 THINK IT THROUGH      How can we make clear to our Christian friends, and
                    others, how God will annihilate evil? It will be brief but
                    eternal in its effects.

                         "A terrible conflict is before us. We are nearing the battle
                    of the great day of God Almighty. That which has been held
                    in control is to be let loose. The angel of mercy is folding her
                    wings, preparing to step down from the throne and leave the
                    world to the control of Satan. The principalities and powers of
                    earth are in bitter revolt against the God of heaven. They are
                    filled with hatred against those who serve Him, and soon, very
                    soon, will be fought the last great battle between good and
                    evil. The earth is to be the battlefield—the scene of the final
                    contest and the final victory."—My Lite Today, page 308.

   "And 1 heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle
of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his
people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God." Rev. 21:3.




   "In the school of Christ students never graduate. Among the pupils are both
the old and the young. Those who give heed to the instructions of the Divine
Teacher constantly advance in wisdom, refinement, and nobility of soul, and
thus they are prepared to enter that higher school, where advancement will
continue throughout eternity....

   "To dwell forever in this home of the blest, to bear in soul, body, and spirit,
not the dark traces of sin and the curse, but the perfect likeness of our Creator,
and through ceaseless ages to advance in wisdom, in knowledge and holi-
ness, ever exploring new fields of thought, ever finding new wonders and new
glories, ever increasing in capacity to know and to enjoy and to love, and know-
ing that there is still beyond us joy and love and wisdom infinite—such is the
object to which the Christian hope is pointing.

   "In the world to come Christ will lead the redeemed beside the river of life
and will teach them wonderful lessons of truth. He will unfold to them the mys-
teries of nature. They will see that a master hand holds the world in position."

           Part 1       "And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first
   A NEW HEAVEN      heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was
                     no more sea. And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem,
 AND A NEW EARTH     coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride
                     adorned for her husband. And I heard a great voice out of
                     heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men,
                     and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people,
                     and God himself shall be with them, and be their God."
                     Rev. 21:1-3.
                        What outstanding difference did John note between the
                     new earth and the present earth? Verse 1.
                         "The sea divides friends. It is a barrier between us and
                     those whom we love. Our associations are broken up by the
                     broad, fathomless ocean. In the new earth there will be no
                     more sea, and there shall pass there 'no galley with oars.' In
                     the past many who have loved and served God have been
                     bound by chains to their seats in galleys, compelled to serve
                     the purpose of cruel, hardhearted men. The Lord has looked
                     upon their suffering in sympathy and compassion. Thank God,
                     in the earth made new there will be no fierce torrents, no en-
                     gulfing ocean, no restless, murmuring waves."—Ellen G. White
                     Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 7, p. 988.
                        What promise did God make through Isaiah? Isa. 65:17.
                        "All will be a happy, united family, clothed with the gar-
                     ments of praise and thanksgiving—the robe of Christ's righ-
                     teousness.
                        "All nature in its surpassing loveliness will offer to God a
                     constant tribute of praise and adoration. The world will be
                     bathed in the light of heaven. The years will move on in glad-
                     ness. The light of the moon will be as the light of the sun, and
                     the light of the sun will be sevenfold greater than it is now.
                     Over the scene the morning stars will sing together, and the
                     sons of God will shout for joy, while Christ and God will unite
                     in proclaiming, 'There shall be no more sin, neither shall there
                     by any more death.' "—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible
                     Commentary, Vol. 7, p. 988.
                        What is the greatest promise of all about the new earth?
                     Verse 3 (last part).
                        We will have not only a new world, but the Creator of the
                     universe will be our King. "God Himself" will be with us, dwell-
                     ing on this renewed earth.
 THINK IT THROUGH       How can I arrange for more time to ponder these tremen-
                     dous truths? Is my life being shaped by this revelation of
                     divine love?

           Part 2    "And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and
 TEARS AND DEATH there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying,
                  neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things
        BANISHED are passed away. And he that sat upon the throne said, Be-
                    hold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for
                    these words are true and faithful. And he said unto me, It
                    is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end.
                    I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water
                    of life freely. He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and
                    I will be his God, and he shall be my son." Rev. 21:4-7.
                       God wipes away tears by removing all causes of sorrow.
                    Pain will be banished forever, and death will be unknown in
                    that land of delights.
                       What are the promises given in verse 4?
                        The "former things" or the "old order" (NEB) is no more.
                    All is different.
                        "We tried to call up our greatest trials, but they looked so
                    small compared with the far more exceeding and eternal weight
                    of glory that surrounded us that we could not speak them out,
                    and we all cried out, 'Alleluia, heaven is cheap enough!' and
                    we touched our glorious harps and made heaven's arches
                    ring."—Early Writings, page 17.
                       What are the words of the One who sits on the throne?
                    Verse 5.
                       "This earth is not to be destroyed, but to be renewed. It will
                    be an eternal witness of God's great love."—R. A. Anderson,
                    Unfolding the Revelation, page 201.
                       What is the one condition to be an inheritor of all these
                    glories? Verse 7.
                        The overcomer will not be just a visitor, much less an alien
                    in that world of wonders. He will belong to the family. God will
                    be his Father, and God says, "He shall be my son."
                       To whom is the water of life to be given? Verse 6.

 THINK IT THROUGH      What kind of literature or amusements do I enjoy? Am I
                    thirsting for "the water of life," or am I satisfied to drink
                    from the polluted fountains of this world?
                       "The earth itself, the very field that Satan claims as his, is
                    to be not only ransomed but exalted. Our little world, under
                    the curse of sin the one dark blot in His glorious creation,
                    will be honored above all other worlds in the universe of God."

             Part 3      "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable,
        THE CITY—I    and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idola-
                      ters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which
                      burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.
                      And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had
                      the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with
                      me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the
                      Lamb's wife. And he carried me away in the spirit to a great
                      and high mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy
                      Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God, having the
                      glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone most pre-
                      cious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal." Rev. 21:8-11.
                        Who invited John to witness this city descending from
                      God? Verse 9.
                         What a contrast this was to the tragic picture of destruction
                      the prophet had witnessed when the earth was devastated and
                      the great cities of earth collapsed! How the exiled prophet
                      must have responded to this scene of glory!
                         But who were deprived from entering that city of light
                      and purity? Verse 8.
                         Note that the list begins with those called the "fearful," or
                      the cowardly, those who give up in time of trial. Then come
                      the "unbelieving," or the untrustworthy. Then the "abomi-
                      nable," meaning those from whom one turns in disgust. The
                      "murderous" are those who follow in the footsteps of Cain. The
                      term "whoremongers," or fornicators, includes those who sin
                      sexually. "Sorcerers" are those who practice magic and
                      spiritualism. The designation "idolators" takes in more than
                      the heathen. Christians can also be idolators. And "all liars"
                      is a significant expression. While Christians would not tell lies,
                      yet it is possible to "make lies" by a nod or a gesture. Even
                      to say nothing may amount to lying.
                         Where will the sinner be found at last? Verse 8 (last part).

 THINK IT THROUGH        What does self-examination reveal about my relationship
                      to this list of sins which will at last keep many out of the
                      Holy City? Paul says, "Let a man examine himself." 1 Cor.
                      11:28.
                         "God does not force the will or judgment of any. He takes
                      no pleasure in a slavish obedience. He desires that the crea-
                      tures of His hands shall love Him because He is worthy of
                      love. He would have them obey Him because they have an
                      intelligent appreciation of His wisdom, justice, and benevo-

The Holy City       LESSON 11                                      ❑ Wednesday
                                                                    September11

           Part 4      "And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates,
     THE CITY—II    and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon,
                    which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of
                    Israel: on the east three gates; on the north three gates; on
                    the south three gates; and on the west three gates. And the
                    wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the
                    names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb."
                       "And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the
                    city was pure gold, like unto clear glass." Rev. 21:12-14, 18.
                          What did John see surrounding the Holy City? Verse 12.
                          Whose names were engraved on the twelve gates? Verse
                    12.
                       Whose names did John see on the magnificent founda-
                    tions? Verse 14.
                       The fact that the twelve tribes of Israel are mentioned along
                    with the twelve apostles of the Lamb shows that this city be-
                    longs to God's people of all ages and dispensations. It is not
                    a Jewish city but the dwelling place of God Himself.
                        Who are stationed as the gatekeepers of this city? Verse
                    12.
                        It is not that these entrances need to be guarded, but angels
                    who, through all the centuries have been "sent forth to min-
                    ister for them who shall be heirs of salvation" (Heb. 1:14),
                    stand at the gates of this mighty city to welcome those who
                    come and go through the gates. And what a welcome it will be
                    for those who by the grace of their Lord have overcome all
                    the power of the enemy and have a right to the tree of life!
 THINK IT THROUGH        How do I react to the thought of living in the city Jesus
                    has prepared for me?
                        "The veil that interposes between the visible and the invis-
                    ible world will be drawn aside, and wonderful things will be
                    revealed....
                        "There all who have wrought with unselfish spirit will behold
                    the fruit of their labors. The outworking of every right prin-
                    ciple and noble deed will be seen. . . . How little of the result
                    of the world's noblest work is in this life manifest to the doer!
                    . . . Parents and teachers lie down in their last sleep, their
                    lifework seeming to have been wrought in vain; they know not
                    that their faithfulness has unsealed springs of blessing that
                    can never cease to flow; only by faith they see the children
                    they have trained become a benediction and an inspiration to
                    their fellow men, and the influence repeat itself a thousand-
                    fold. . . . In the hereafter the action and reaction of all these
                    will be seen."—Education, pages 304-306.

                                                                     September 12

            Part 5       "And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure
      THE CITY—III   the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof. And
                     the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the
                     breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thou-
                     sand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of
                     it are equal."

                        "And the foundations of the wall of the city were gar-
                     nished with all manner of precious stones. The first founda-
                     tion was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony;
                     the fourth, an emerald.... And the twelve gates were twelve
                     pearls: every several gate was of one pearl: and the street
                     of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass."
                     Rev. 21:15, 16, 19-21.

                        What is the shape of this capital city of the new earth?
                     Verse 16.

                        Some have asked if the city will be able to accommodate
                     the millions of the saved. The measurements given by the angel
                     are amazing. Who could imagine a city nearly 1,500 miles in
                     circumference or 375 on each side. The jasper walls of that
                     city enclose 2,250,000 square miles! Someone has estimated
                     that all the people who have ever lived on this earth from
                     Adam's time to our own could crowd into that giant city, and
                     there would still be room for visitors from other worlds. But
                     only those who have accepted of God's grace and been obe-
                     dient to all the truth the Lord has revealed will enter there.
                         What feature of the city is a strange contrast with earthly
                     cities? Verse 18.

                        In The Great Controversy, pages 674, 675 we read: "A fear
                     of making the future inheritance seem too material has led
                     many to spiritualize away the very truths which lead us to look
                     upon it as our home."

 THINK IT THROUGH        Am I permitting the trials and disappointments of this
                     present life to rob me of the anticipation of the glories of the
                     life to come?

                         "Preachers and people have looked upon the book of Reve-
                     lation as mysterious, and of less importance than other portions
                     of the Sacred Scriptures. But I saw that this book is indeed a
                     revelation given for the especial benefit of those who should
                     live in the last days, to guide them in ascertaining their true
                     position and their duty."—Early Writings, page 231.

           Part 6      "And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty
     GOD'S GLORY    and the Lamb are the temple of it. And the city had no need
                    of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory
                    of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof. And
                    the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light
                    of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and
                    honour into it. And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by
                    day: for there shall be no night there. And they shall bring
                    the glory and honour of the nations into it. And there shall
                    in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither what-
                    soever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they which
                    are written in the Lamb's book of life." Rev. 21:22-27.
                        What is absent in the New Jerusalem which was the center
                    of old Jerusalem? Why? Verse 22.
                        What kind of illumination will this city have? Verse 23.
                        "Light-giving bodies will not be imperative for the illumina-
                    tion of the city. The glorious effulgence of the presence of God
                    will give more than sufficient light (cf. Isa. 60:19, 20). Material
                    things are not indispensable in God's plan; in His presence
                    they are put to shame (cf. Isa. 24:23). Created light cannot
                    outshine the uncreated glory of the divine presence."—SDA
                    Bible Commentary, on Rev. 21:23.
                        What nations will bring honor to the Holy City? Verse 24.
                       "The fire that consumes the wicked purifies the earth. Every
                    trace of the curse is swept away. No eternally burning hell
                    will keep before the ransomed the fearful consequences of sin.
                        "One reminder alone remains: Our Redeemer will ever bear
                    the marks of His crucifixion. Upon His wounded head, upon
                    His side, His hands and feet, are the only traces of the cruel
                    work that sin has wrought. . . . And the tokens of His humilia-
                    tion are His highest honor; through the eternal ages the wounds
                    of Calvary will show forth His praise and declare His power."

 THINK IT THROUGH        How am I preparing to live in the city lighted by the
                    glory of God?
                        "This earth is the place of preparation for heaven. The time
                    spent here is the Christian's winter. Here the chilly winds of
                    affliction blow upon us, and the waves of trouble roll against
                    us. But in the near future, when Christ comes, sorrow and sigh-
                    ing will be forever ended. Then will be the Christian's sum-
                     mer. All trials will be over, and there will be no more sickness
                    or death. 'God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and
                     there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying . . . :
                     for the former things are passed away.' "—Ellen G. White

   "And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every
man according as his work shall be." Rev. 22:12.


  "In the plan of redemption there are heights and depths that eternity itself
can never exhaust, marvels into which the angels desire to look. The redeemed
only, of all created beings, have in their own experience known the actual
conflict with sin; they have wrought with Christ, and, as even the angels could
not do, have entered into the fellowship of His sufferings. . . .

             Part 1      "And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as
         RIVER AND    crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the
                      Lamb. In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of
       TREE OF LIFE   the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve man-
                      ner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the
                      leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations." Rev.
                      22:1, 2.
                         What did John see proceeding from God's throne? Verse 1.
                         What was growing on either side of the river? Verse 2.
                         "The picture thus presented before the mind is this: The
                      glorious throne of God at the head of this broad way, or ave-
                      nue; out of that throne the river of life, flowing lengthwise
                      through the center of the street; and the tree of life growing
                      on either side, forming a high and magnificent arch over that
                      majestic stream, and spreading its life-bearing branches far
                      away on either side. . . .
                         "But how can the tree of life be but one tree, and still be
                      on either side of the river? It is evident that there is but one
                      tree of life. From Genesis to the Revelation it is spoken of as
                      but one—the tree of life. To be at once on both sides of the
                      river, it must have more than one trunk, in which case it would
                      be united above in order to form but one tree."—Uriah Smith,
                      Daniel and the Revelation, pages 771, 772.
                          What did John say about the leaves of the tree? Verse 2
                      (last part).
                         Some translations read "the service of the nations" which
                      is better, for in that land of delights there will be no sickness,
                      pain, or death.
                         "The fruit of the tree of life in the Garden of Eden possessed
                      supernatural virtue. To eat of it was to live forever. Its fruit was
                      the antidote of death. Its leaves were for the sustaining of life
                      and immortality."—Testimonies, Vol. 8, p. 288.

 THINK IT THROUGH          Am I anticipating with joy that time when our great
                      Teacher will lead us to the tree of life and explain the plan
                      of redemption?
                          "The tree of life is a representation of the preserving care
                      of Christ for His children. As Adam and Eve ate of this tree,
                      they acknowledged their dependence upon God. The tree of
                      life possessed the power to perpetuate life, and as long as they
                      ate of it, they could not die. The lives of the antediluvians
                      were protracted because of the life-giving power of this tree,

                                                                     September 16

           Part 2      "And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God
   THE THRONE OF    and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve
                    him: and they shall see his face; and his name shall be in
GOD AND THE LAMB    their foreheads." Rev. 22: 3, 4.
                       What do we have to endure in the world today that will
                    be missing in the new earth? Verse 3, (first part).
                        The simple emphatic expression "the throne of God and
                    of the Lamb" is very revealing. When Lucifer challenged God
                    for His throne and then ultimately won the allegiance of Adam,
                    this newly created world became the battleground of the forces
                    of good and evil. Adam was no longer a king with the oversight
                    of earth. He became a servant of sin under the dominion of
                    Satan.
                        Having yielded to the devil, Adam thereby passed on sin to
                    all his posterity. Rom. 5:12. We were lost, hopelessly lost; but
                    in the fullness of time God Himself, in the person of Jesus
                     Christ, came to take the place of Adam—to pay the penalty of
                    sin, to suffer and die a vicarious death on our behalf. Pointing
                    Him out in the crowd, John the Baptist cried out with confi-
                    dence: "Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin
                    of the world." John 1:29. Three and a half years later He was
                     led as a lamb to the slaughter. But He rose from the dead and
                    ascended to His Father. While reigning as coregent of the
                    universe He also is our great High Priest, officiating as both
                    Priest and Victim, as Offerer and Offering—the Lamb of God.
                     So the throne of the universe is called "the throne of God and
                    of the Lamb." It was as the Lamb of God that He offered Him-
                     self for a lost world and a lost race.
                        In the ages of eternity to come the eternal throne of Deity
                     will always be "the throne of the Lamb." We will never exhaust
                     the theme of our redemption.
                        The world we know today is under a three-fold curse—thorns
                     and thistles (Gen. 3:17); diminished production (Gen. 4:12);
                     and the Flood (Gen. 8:21).

 THINK IT THROUGH      How have these curses affected my life?
                       "All faces will reflect the image of their Redeemer. There
                    will then be no anxious, troubled countenances, but all will
                    be bright, and smiling in spotless purity. The angels will be
                    there, also the resurrected saints with the martyrs, and the
                    best of all, and what will cause us the most joy, our lovely
                    Saviour, who suffered and died that we might enjoy that hap-
                    piness and freedom, will be there.—His glorious face will shine
                    brighter than the sun, and light up the beautiful city and reflect
                    glory all around."—My Life Today, page 357.

              Part 3      "And they shall see his face; and his name shall be in
     THEY SHALL SEE    their foreheads. And there shall be no night there; and they
                       need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God
           HIS FACE    giveth them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever."
                       Rev. 22:4, 5.
                          What wonderful promise is given to the saints of God?
                       Verse 4.
                          What about the Holy City will be different from any
                       earthly city? Verse 5.

                           "In the City of God 'there shall be no night.' None will need
                       or desire repose. There will be no weariness in doing the will
                       of God and offering praise to His name. We shall ever feel
                       the freshness of the morning and shall ever be far from its
                       close. 'And they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for
                       the Lord God giveth them light.' Revelation 22:5. The light of
                       the sun will be superseded by a radiance which is not pain-
                       fully dazzling, yet which immeasurably surpasses the bright-
                       ness of our noontide. The glory of God and the Lamb floods
                       the Holy City with unfading light. The redeemed walk in the
                       sunless glory of perpetual day."—The Great Controversy, page
                       676.
                           The righteous will walk in that radiant city and know they
                       have a right there. Not that any of their works earned them
                       a place in God's kingdom, but because they have accepted
                       His invitation to become members of His family through grace,
                       and grace alone. Any works of righteousness we do are not to
                       earn salvation, but because we have already received salva-
                       tion.
                           "The people of God are privileged to hold open communion
                       with the Father and the Son. 'Now we see through a glass,
                       darkly.' 1 Corinthians 13:12. We behold the image of God
                       reflected, as in a mirror, in the works of nature and in His
                       dealings with men; but then we shall see Him face to face,
                       without a dimming veil between. We shall stand in His presence
                       and behold the glory of His countenance."—The Great Contro-

                                                                  September 18

           Part 4      "And he said unto me, these sayings are faithful and
   BEHOLD I COME    true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel
                    to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be
        QUICKLY     clone. Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keepeth the
                    sayings of the prophecy of this book." Rev. 22:6, 7.
                      When the voice from heaven unfolded the future to John,
                    what was its special emphasis? Verse 7.
                      The keynote of the Revelation is the second coming of
                  Christ. "The attention of the people should be called to the
                  momentous event which is so near at hand. The signs of the
                  times should be kept fresh before their minds. The prophetic
                  visions of Daniel and John foretell a period of moral darkness
                  and declension; but at the time of the end, the time in which
                  we are now living, the vision was to speak and not lie. When
                  the signs predicted begin to come to pass, the waiting, watch-
                  ing ones are bidden to look up and lift up their heads and re-
                  joice because their redemption draweth nigh."—Testimonies,
                  Vol. 5, pp. 9, 10.
                      It is those who will live in harmony with the message of
                  the book of Revelation that are here called "blessed" or
                  "happy."
                      "Christ is coming with power and great glory. He is coming
                  with His own glory and with the glory of the Father. He is
                  coming with all the holy angels with Him. While all the world
                  is plunged in darkness, there will be light in every dwelling of
                  the saints. They will catch the first light of His second appear-
                  ing. The unsullied light will shine from His splendor, and Christ
                  the Redeemer will be admired by all who have served Him.
                  While the wicked flee from His presence, Christ's followers
                  will rejoice."—Christ's Object Lessons, pages 420, 421.
                       In what way will the wicked react to the blazing glory of
                  Christ? Rev. 6:15-17.
                      Because of the tremendous issues involved, the Lord is
                   sending an urgent appeal, His last appeal, to all the world.
                   The three angels' messages of Revelation 14 are the heart of
                  that appeal.
 THINK IT THROUGH       What is the urgency of God's message for this generation?
                       "God has presented to me the dangers that are threatening
                   those who have been given the sacred work of proclaiming the
                   third angel's message. They are to remember that this message
                   is of the utmost consequence to the whole world. They need
                   to search the Scriptures diligently, that they may learn how to
                   guard against the mystery of iniquity, which plays so large a
                   part in the closing scenes of this earth's history."—Ellen G.

           Part 5       "Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keepeth the
 BLESSED ARE THEY   sayings of the prophecy of this book. And I John saw these
                    things, and heard them. And when I had heard and seen, I
                    fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which
                    shewed me these things. Then saith he unto me, See thou
                    do it not: for I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren the
                    prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book:
                    worship God." Rev. 22:7-9.

                       A special blessing is pronounced on those who keep the
                    sayings of the prophecies of this book. As we have noticed
                    in previous lessons, the great majority of those who study
                    Revelation push its prophecies away off into the future. Not only
                    do they lose the blessing the Lord has promised, but they are
                    left unprepared for the tremendous events which will most
                    definitely affect all believers.
                       What did the angel say to John at the conclusion of the
                    great revelation he had received? Verse 10.

                       When Daniel received his visions, he was told to seal some
                    of them. On the other hand John's visions were relevant to his
                    day. But even more relevant to our day, "for the time is at
                    hand."
                        "Christ the Revelator, foreseeing the warfare that would be
                    waged against the study of the Revelation, pronounced a bless-
                    ing upon all who should read, hear, and observe the words of
                    the prophecy."—The Great Controversy, page 342.
                       When John received this revelation, what was his attitude
                    toward the angel? Verse 8.

                       This was the second time John sought to worship the angel.
                    And he met the same rebuke. The heavenly messenger wanted
                    him to know that he too was a creature and could not accept
                    worship due to God alone.

THINK IT THROUGH       Am I studying these prophecies of Revelation and related
                    prophecies concerning our day as diligently as is urged by
                    the spirit of prophecy? Am I keeping abreast of the times?

                        "As we near the close of time, there will be greater and
                    still greater external parade of heathen power; heathen deities
                     will manifest their signal power, and will exhibit themselves
                     before the cities of the world. . . . All need wisdom carefully
                     to search out the mystery of iniquity that figures so largely in
                    the winding up of this earth's history."—Testimonies to Min-

           Part 6       "And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the proph-
   THE TIME IS AT   ecy of this book: for the time is at hand. He that is unjust, let
                    him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy
           HAND     still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and
                    he that is holy, let him be holy still. And, behold, I come
                    quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man
                    according as his work shall be." Rev. 22:10-12.
                       "The time is at hand" said the voice from heaven to John.
                    But what time? The time indicated by the prophecies. And
                    those "things" (verse 6) meet their climax in the second com-
                    ing of Christ.
                        What solemn pronouncement is made just prior to our
                    Saviour's return? Verse 11.
                       "When the work of the investigative judgment closes, the
                    destiny of all will have been decided for life or death. Proba-
                    tion is ended a short time before the appearing of the Lord in
                    the clouds of heaven....
                       "The righteous and the wicked will still be living upon the
                    earth in their mortal state—men will be planting and building,
                    eating and drinking, all unconscious that the final, irrevocable
                    decision has been pronounced in the sanctuary above. Before
                    the Flood, after Noah entered the ark, God shut him in and
                    shut the ungodly out; but for seven days the people, knowing
                    not that their doom was fixed, continued their careless, plea-
                    sure-loving life and mocked the warnings of impending judg-
                    ment. 'So,' says the Saviour, 'shall also the coming of the Son
                    of man be.' Matthew 24:39. Silently, unnoticed as the midnight
                    thief, will come the decisive hour which marks ,the fixing of
                    every man's destiny, the final withdrawal of nnercy's offer to
                    guilty men."—The Great Controversy, pages 490, 491.
                       Who makes the pronouncement? Verse 12.
                       The same One who comes in glory bringing His rewards
                    with Him is the One who, as Judge, pronounces the sentence.
                    See John 5:22, 27.
                       Those who are "unjust," because "unjustified," remain un-
                    just. Those who are "holy" remain holy for all eternity. There
                    will be no further opportunity to accept salvation.
 THINK IT THROUGH      How shall I be just before God and the judgment?
                       "God designed that the Prince of sufferers in humanity
                    should be judge of the whole world. . . . He alone is to pro-
                    nounce the sentence of reward or of punishment. . . . Both
                    saints and sinners will recognize in him who was crucified the
                    Judge of all living."—Ellen G. White, Review and Herald, Nov.

"And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth
say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will,
let him take the water of life freely." Rev. 22:17.



  "We are living in the closing scenes of this earth's history....
We have no time—not a moment—to lose. Let us not be found
sleeping on guard.... Let us persuade men and women everywhere
to repent and flee from the wrath to come. Let us arouse them to
immediate preparation, for we little know what is before us....
   "He [the Lord] is soon coming, and we must be ready and wait-
ing for His appearing. Oh, how glorious it will be to see Him and
be welcomed as His redeemed ones! ... If we can but see the
King in His beauty we shall be forever blessed. I feel as if I must
cry aloud: 'Homeward bound!' We are nearing the time when Christ
will come in power and great glory to take His ransomed ones to
their eternal home....
   "In the great closing work we shall meet with perplexities that we
know not how to deal with; but let us not forget that the three
great powers of heaven are working, that a divine hand is on the
wheel, and that God will bring His promises to pass. He will gather
from the world a people who will serve Him in righteousness."—

                                                                      September 22

            Part 1       "I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the
      THE BLESSED    first and the last. Blessed are they that do his commandments,
                     that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter
                     in through the gates into the city." Rev. 22:13, 14.

                       How does our Lord introduce Himself as He prepares to
                     make His last appeal? Verse 13.

                         This is the fourth time the expression Alpha and Omega is
                     used in the Revelation. These are the first and last letters of
                     the Greek alphabet. It is a significant title when we realize
                     that much that we communicate in knowledge is symbolized
                     by letters, and it is thus an appropriate title for the One who
                     is the Word. But more, the Lord Jesus is the "author and fin-
                     isher of our faith." Heb. 12:2.
                         What is the closing benediction in this book? Verse 14
                     (first part).
                          "This passage is sometimes translated, 'Blessed are those
                     who wash their robes.' . . . Whichever reading is preferred the
                     result is the same, for only those who have 'washed their robes
                     . . . in the blood of the Lamb' (Revelation 7:14) are able to 'do
                     His commandments.' Obedience is never a ground of grace;
                     but God's grace is the only ground for our obedience. It was
                     disobedience that shut our first parents out of Eden and de-
                     barred them from the tree of life. And only through the all-
                     sufficient sacrifice of Christ and a life of submission to God's
                     will can man be reinstated in the Paradise of God and again
                     have access to the tree of life."—R. A. Anderson, Unfolding the
                     Revelation, pages 209, 210.

                        To what do the cleansed and obedient ones have a right?
                     Verse 14 (last part).

                        Admission into the Holy City and authority or the right to
                     partake of the tree of life is reserved for those only who, like
                     their Redeemer, are faithful and true.

 THINK IT THROUGH       When the righteous Judge shall weigh my motives, as well
                     as my words, how will I stand?

                        "When probation ends, it will come suddenly, unexpectedly
                     —at a time when we are least expecting it. But we can have
                     a clean record in heaven today, and know that God accepts us;
                     and finally, if faithful, we shall be gathered into the kingdom
                     of heaven."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commen-

The Invitation LESSON 13                                               ❑ Monday
                                                                      September 23

          Part 2       How does our Lord classify those outside the Holy City?
   THOSE OUTSIDE
        THE CITY       "Outside are dogs, sorcerers and fornicators, murderers
                    and idolators, and all who love and practice deceit." Rev.
                    22:15, NEB.

                        The allusion to dogs had real meaning for those to whom the
                    Revelation was first sent, for hungry, semi-wild dogs used
                    often to wander about the streets of many ancient cities, .de-
                    vouring dead bodies and other refuse. See 1 Kings 14:11. And
                    it is in this setting that the figure is used. Another group
                    mentioned are those who practiced sorcery or spiritualism. The
                    whoremongers and fornicators are mentioned next. Sexual
                    license, even depravity, is a mark of our times, as are also
                    murderers. Idolators includes more than the heathen who wor-
                    ship idols of wood and stone. Many kinds of idol worship
                    beset the people of God today. Last on the list are the liars,
                    or those who practice some form of deceit; it may be in busi-
                    ness or in the home or cheating on income tax or examina-
                    tions. It is sobering to ponder that all such will be outside the
                    city.
                       By contrast what is the fruit of the Spirit? Gal. 5:22, 23.

                       It is in this life that we must prepare for the life to come.
                    How easily the purity of our affections and the integrity of our
                    thoughts can be changed! Suddenly we get flurried, annoyed,
                    agitated, and the quiet waters of the soul are lashed into fury.
                    Isaiah said, "The wicked are like the troubled sea, . . . whose
                    waters cast up mire and dirt." Isa. 57:20. To enter the'city of
                    God we must be overcomers.

 THINK IT THROUGH       Am I cooperating with the Spirit of God to gain the vic-
                    tory over my own sinful self? Am I crucifying the flesh with
                    its affections?

                        "When we become children of God, our names are written
                    in the Lamb's book of life, and they remain there until the time
                    of the investigative judgment. Then the name of every individ-
                    ual will be called, and his record examined, by Him who de-
                    clares, 'I know thy works.' If in that day it shall appear that all
                    our wicked deeds have not been fully repented of, our names
                    will be blotted from the book of life, and our sins will stand
                    against us."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commen-

                                                                     September 24

           Part 3      "I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these
      THE BRIGHT    things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of
AND MORNING STAR    David, and the bright and morning star." Rev. 22:16. •
                      "The bright and morning star" is one of the many titles of
                    our Lord. This is one of the oldest, most significant of all His
                    Scriptural titles. The first reference is in Numbers 24:17, where
                    we read, "There shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre
                    shall rise out of Israel."
                       How did Zacharias, father of John the Baptist, refer to
                    the coming Redeemer? Luke 1:77, 78.
                       The New English Bible reads: "The morning sun from heaven
                    will rise (or has risen) upon us."
                        In what terms is our Lord spoken of in the closing book
                    of the Old Testament? Mal. 4:2.
                       Just as the rising sun dispels the darkness, bringing warmth,
                    growth, and blessing to the earth, so does our Lord's presence
                    in our lives bring spiritual growth and blessing, dispelling the
                    darkness of our sinful nature.
                        What other identification of Himself does He give? Rev.
                    22:16.
                       It is paradoxical to call Jesus "the root" and at the same
                    time "the offspring." When Jesus asked the Pharisees "What
                    think ye of Christ? whose son is he?" they answered, "The
                    Son of David." Matt. 22:42. Then Jesus quoted Psalm 110:1,
                    where it says, "The Lord said unto my Lord," et cetera. Then
                    the Master asked them, "If David then call him Lord, how is
                    he his son?" Matt. 22:45. That was too much for those religious
                    leaders. They could not answer. Jesus existed, was Creator,
                    and thus the root of David. But in the fullness of time He was
                     born of a woman through the line of David, and so was David's
                    offspring.
 THINK IT THROUGH       Is Christ the Daystar in my life? Can I sing these words
                    sincerely: "All the darkness of the night has passed away; it
                    is morning in my heart"?
                        "Those who wait for the Bridegroom's coming are to say to
                    the people, 'Behold your God.' The last rays of merciful light,
                    the last message of mercy to be given to the world, is a reve-
                    lation of His character of love. The children of God are to
                    manifest His glory. In their own life and character they are to
                    reveal what the grace of God has done for them.
                       "The light of the Sun of Righteousness is to shine forth in
                    good works—in words of truth and deeds of holiness."—

           Part 4      "And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him
       THE FINAL    that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And
                    whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely." Rev.
      INVITATION    22:17.
                       Which person of the Godhead, and with Him who else,
                    gives the final invitation? Verse 17. Identify the symbol.
                       The last command to Noah just before the great Flood was:
                    "Come thou and all thy house into the ark." Gen. 7:1. A simi-
                    lar appeal is now going to all mankind. Just as in Noah's day
                    the only ones who escaped the Flood were those who re-
                    sponded to God's call, so today the only ones who will be
                    protected during the plagues and from the second death at
                    last are those who hear and heed God's final invitation.
                        "All who are partakers of this great salvation wrought out
                    by Jesus Christ are under obligation to work as laborers to-
                    gether with God. In the heavenly courts the roll is called, on
                    which every name is registered, and the heavenly agencies
                    respond to the call. The service given by every human being
                    upon earth is there recorded. If any are negligent, it is re-
                    corded; if diligent, the same is reported; if idlers, the fact
                    stands against their names. In all the great mass of humanity,
                    not one is lost sight of. Then let every one be ready to answer
                     the call, saying, 'Here, Lord, ready for action.'
                        "The world has claims upon you. If you fail to shine as lights
                    in the world, some will rise in the judgment, and charge upon
                     you the blood of their souls."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA
                    Bible Commentary, Vol. 7, p. 987.
                        How far-reaching is the invitation to accept the water of
                    life? Verse 17.
                       When the woman of Samaria heard Jesus speaking about
                    "the water of life," she desired to know more. Then she hur-
                    ried to the townspeople and invited them to hear the words
                    of life from the Master. Having heard, she then said, "Come!"

 THINK IT THROUGH      How much am I doing to invite my friends and neighbors
                    to drink of the water of life?
                       "Like the waters of the Flood the fires of the great day de-
                    clare God's verdict that the wicked are incurable. They have
                    no disposition to submit to divine authority. Their will has been
                    exercised in revolt; and when life is ended, it is too late to
                    turn the current of their thoughts in the opposite direction, too
                    late to turn from transgression to obedience, from hatred to
                    love."—The Great Controversy, page 543.

                           "Men cannot with impunity trample upon the word of God.
                       The meaning of this fearful denunciation is set forth in the
                       closing chapter of the Revelation: [Rev. 22:18, 19 quoted.] ...
                           "Such are the warnings which God has given to guard men
                       against changing in any manner that which He has revealed or
                       commanded. These solemn denunciations apply to all who by
                       their influence lead men to regard lightly the law of God. They
                       should cause those to fear and tremble who flippantly declare
                       it a matter of little consequence whether we obey God's law
                       or not. All who exalt their own opinions above divine revela-
                       tion, all who would change the plain meaning of Scripture to
                       suit their own convenience, or for the sake of conforming to
                       the world, are taking upon themselves a fearful responsibility.
                       The written word, the law of God, will measure the character of
                       every man and condemn all whom this unerring test shall de-
                       clare wanting."—The Great Controversy, page 268.
                         If men take away the truth from these prophecies, what
                       does Christ, the Judge, say He will take from them? Verse 19.
                          Even by neglecting to study and apply these messages to
                       ourselves we might be guilty of taking away from these proph-
                       ecies.

 THINK IT THROUGH         Are the prophecies of Revelation finding a positive re-
                       sponse in my heart? Am I bringing my life into harmony
                       with the challenging message of this book?
                          "The One who has stood as our intercessor; who hears all
                       penitential prayers and confessions; who is represented with a
                       rainbow, the symbol of grace and love, encircling His head, is
                       soon to cease His work in the heavenly sanctuary. Grace and
                       mercy will then descend from the throne, and justice will take
                       their place. He for whom His people have looked will assume
                       His right—the office of Supreme Judge."—Ellen G. White Com-

The Invitation       LESSON 13                                            ❑ Friday
                                                                       September 27

            Part 6      "He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come
   EVEN SO, COME,    quickly. Amen. Even so, come, lord Jesus. The grace of our
                     Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen." Rev. 22:20, 21.
      LORD JESUS
                        What was John's last prayer of response? Verse 20.
                        Those words, "Even so, come, Lord Jesus," are John's
                     closing prayer. Inspired of God to bring us the Revelation, he
                     now prepares to lay aside his pen. Just as he does, the Lord
                     announces anew the certainty of His coming, and the old
                     Patmos prophet, knowing his work as heaven's recorder is
                     at an end, ponders the meaning of what he has written. Then
                     from the depths of his soul his response is, "Even so, come,
                     Lord Jesus." That has been the prayer of God's faithful ones
                     through all the ages since that day.
                         When Abraham was called of God, for what was he look-
                      ing? Heb. 11:10.
                         Although he had been blessed with wealth, how did he
                      regard the Land of Promise where he sojourned? Heb. 11:9.
                         Abraham's attitude to material possessions is a great ex-
                      ample for us all. He lived in the important city of Ur. He was
                      a man of wealth with his father, Terah, before he left his home-
                      land bound for a land he did not know. When he arrived in the
                      land to which God directed him, he again became wealthy.
                      But he was dwelling as a stranger in the Promised Land, for
                      his eyes envisioned the eternal city God was preparing for His
                      people. This earth with all its miasma and pollution is to be
                      renewed. The fires of God will not destroy the planet, but only
                      purify it. Out of the ashes the Creator will bring forth a new
                      and beautiful world with no trace of sin or contamination. Re-
                      bellion will be at an end. And on that new earth the city for
                      which the saints of all the ages looked will be the capital. This
                      was the great metropolis the angel described to John. No
                      wonder the exiled prophet exclaimed, "Even so, come, Lord
                      Jesus!" Come quickly! Should not that be our prayer?

 THINK IT THROUGH        What is my response to the announcement, "Surely I come
                      quickly"?
                          "The meek shall inherit the earth." It was through the desire
                      for self-exaltation that sin entered into the world, and our first
                      parents lost the dominion over this fair earth, their kingdom.
                      It is through self-abnegation that Christ redeems what was lost.
                      And He says we are to overcome as He did. Rev. 3:21. Through
                      humility and self-surrender we may become heirs with Him
                      when "the meek shall inherit the earth." Ps. 37:11.

   CHARISMIsk
   OF 1HE SPIRIT
by Rene
    Currently, speaking in tongues is the rage of over 50 Christian
denominations throughout America. And the movement is growing.
Catholics, Methodists, Episcopalians, Baptists, and others thrill with
what they believe to be the true language of the Holy Spirit.
    What does it mean to open the door to semiunconsciousness so that
an unknown tongue can emerge? What is it that rushes in to cause the
tumbling, melodic sounds?
    Speaking in tongues. One man stands aside. Listens intently to the
sounds of ecstasy, watches the events taking place, speaks to key
people. Refers to history for comparison. He writes a book.
     Rene Noorbergen's CHARISMA OF THE SPIRIT investigates the
tongues movement. Hear it from various ministers of the churches
involved, from participating church member's, from language experts,
and, for contrast, from representatives of the psychic world.
     Because the tongues movement is becoming more powerful as time
goes on, we ask, "What does it
mean?" You will find that CHA-
RISMA OF THE SPIRIT, is an aid
to understanding the supernatural
experience of tongues.
