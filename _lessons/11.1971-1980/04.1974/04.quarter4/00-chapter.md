           THIRTEENTH SABBATH OFFERING OVERFLOW

  December 21, 1974—Northern Europe-West Africa Division

   In the Northern Europe-West Africa Division there are two senior
colleges: Adventist College of West Africa (better known by the acronym,
ACWA and pronounced Ak-wah) at Ikeja in Western Nigeria, established
in 1959; and Newbold College, Bracknell, in the Royal county of Berk-
shire, England, founded as Stanborough College in Watford, Hertford-
shire, in 1901. The services of the graduates of these two colleges have
blessed many lands. These two institutions will benefit equally from the
offering overflow of the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering for the fourth quarter.
    For the growth and development of the church in this division we
believe there is no wiser investment than that in Christian education
and Adventist youth.
    Is there a continent more eager for education than Africa? Is there
one in greater need of Christian education? Hardly. At ACWA limited
facilities are greatly handicapping the educational program. Among
many urgent needs is the need for a library. Toward this project the
offering overflow on December 21 will make a substantial contribution.
    In September, 1972, Newbold College began to offer a fifth year of
ministerial training. In cooperation with Andrews University this addi-
tional year of study leads to the master's degree or, with additional
study at Andrews, to the master of divinity degree. Work in the sophisti-
cated countries of Europe requires well-trained evangelists and minis-
ters. In view of the postgraduate program it was necessary that the
school provide a new library. This was completed early this year, and
we have counted on your generous gifts as a part of the plan to finance
its construction.
   We are facing forward and by God's grace and with your help, great
things will be done to prepare youth for their part in the church's
final triumph.

                        A GIFT FROM JESUS
                                   Introduction
     Jesus is a giver. His gifts are many; but the lessons for this quarter focus on
one gift from Jesus.
     Paul referred (Eph. 4:11) to prophets, along with apostles, evangelists, pastors,
and teachers as gifts bestowed on the church by the ascended Saviour. Paul does
not speak of these gifts abstractly as abilities looking for persons to attach to but
concretely as persons whom the Lord Jesus has blessed with certain abilities and
entrusted with certain responsibilities. His gifts to the church are people able to
serve the church for Jesus.
      The gift from Jesus referred to by the title of these lessons is the gift of a
person, Ellen G. White, whom God gave to the remnant church to serve in a
prophetic role.
      Through the ages the divine Revealer of truth has employed prophets as His
agency for the communication of essential knowledge to the church and to the
world. A prophet is a spokesman for God sent by God whose messages ring with
truth and authority.
      The messages that came to Seventh-day Adventists through the agency of
His messenger, Ellen White, came from the same God who spoke through the
prophets of old. She served the Adventist people in much the same way as
Nathan, Gad, Iddo, and Shemaiah served the people of God in Old Testament
 times and as John the Baptist, Agabus, and Silas in New Testament times. See
The Great Controversy, Introduction, page vi11. No writings of these prophets are
 included in the Sacred Canon. The messages of Ellen White are not included in
 the Bible either. She spoke and wrote to attract the minds of the Lord's people
 to the Word. The spirit of prophecy writings are a link that binds Seventh-day
 Adventists to the Bible.
      The relationship of the writings of Ellen White to the Holy Scriptures will
 receive special attention in these Sabbath School lessons. Her work magnifies
 Bible teaching and focuses Bible truth upon the character and mission of the
 remnant people.
       The inspired messengers were not always men. Women also served in a pro-
  phetic role in Bible times. Miriam, Deborah, Huldah, Anna, and the four daughters
  of Philip are examples. The Spirit of God on one occasion came upon Mary, the
  mother of our Lord, and upon Elisabeth, the mother of John the Baptist. Both
  uttered prophetic truth vital to the times in which they lived and relevant to the
  needs of the Christian church.
       Years ago Ellen White wrote concerning the importance of understanding the
  place of the Spirit of prophecy in the Seventh-day Adventist Church.
       "As the end draws near and the work of giving the last warning to the world
  extends, it becomes more important for those who accept 'present truth to have
  a clear understanding of the nature and influence of the Testimonies, which God
  in His providence has linked with the work of the third angel's message from its
  very rise."—Testimonies, Vol. 5, p. 654.
       We shall utilize passages from the Word of God to illustrate the work of the
  ancient prophets. In places there may seem to be some repetition, but this pro-
  vides opportunity to present new facets of the subject. In this quarter's lessons
  parallels will be drawn between the experiences of Bible prophets and those of
  Ellen White. The frequent mention of the name of one person is necessary in deal-
   ing with the subject. But Christ is our leader—not any human being, however
   gifted!

          A DIALOGUE     In the following passage is a record of God's communicat-
               Part 1 ing with Adam and Eve. What means did He use to com-
                        municate with them?

                            "So God created man in his own image, in the image of
                        God created he him; male and female created he them. And
                        God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and
                        multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have
                        dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the
                        air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth."
                        Gen. 1:27, 28.
                             Notice that "the blessing for the animals [v. 22] was pro-
                       'nounced regarding them, 'God blessed them, saying,' whereas
                         the blessing for the human race was expressed 'unto them.' As

                         On what other occasion did God speak directly to man?
                       Gen. 2:15-17.

                          This was a conversation. The first man and woman talked
                       to the Lord and listened to Him speak. Communion was open

        A BARRIER
                       "But your iniquities have separated between you and your
                     God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will
                     not hear." Isa. 59:2.
                       "Your iniquities have become separators betwixt you and
                     your God." Rotherham, The Emphasized Old Testament.

                       Since the fall, how has God communicated with man?
                     Heb. 1:1.

                          "At sundry times. Gr. polumeras, 'in many portions,' in
                     many ways.' The full light from the throne of God did not burst
                     upon men in one great flash of glory. Rather, it came slowly,
                     little by little, as men could comprehend it.
                          "In divers manners. Gr. polutropos, 'in various ways.' God
                     spoke through the prophets by spoken and written message, by
                     parable, and by means of visual aids. Whatever means were
                     employed, it was God who spoke."—SDA Bible Commentary,
                     on Heb. 1:1.
                          If we accept the view that the Bible has been given to us
                     by the true and living God, then we must believe His declara-
                     tions in the Bible concerning the revelation of His character
                     given through His Son, Jesus Christ. God has spoken to the
                     human race in various ways and at different times since the
                     fall of man. Inspiration has been a principal medium.
                          It was God Himself who spoke. Notice the words in He-
                     brews 1:1. "God . . . spake." The writer emphasizes the
                     fact that it was God who spoke through the prophets. The
                     book may bear the name of Isaiah, Amos, Daniel, or John,
                     but God is the source of their messages.
 THINK IT THROUGH       Are you aware of barriers in your life that prevent a daily
                     dialogue with God? How can these "separators" be removed?

                        "Had Adam and Eve never disobeyed their Creator, had
                     they remained in the path of perfect rectitude, they could have
                     known and understood God. But when they listened to the
                     voice of the tempter, and sinned against God, the light of the
                     garments of heavenly innocence departed from them; and in
                     parting with the garments of innocence, they drew about them
                     the dark robes of ignorance of God. The clear and perfect light
                     that had hitherto surrounded them had lightened everything

                           See also Rom. 1:20.
                           "Among the heathen are those who worship God ignorantly,
                       those to whom the light is never brought by human instrumen-
                       tality, yet they will not perish. Though ignorant of the written
                       law of God, they have heard His voice speaking to them in
                       nature, and have done the things that the law required. Their
                       works are evidence that the Holy Spirit has touched their
                       hearts, and they are recognized as the children of God."—The
                       Desire of Ages, page 638.
                          "Through nature and revelation, through His providence,
                       and by the influence of His Spirit, God speaks to us."—Steps
                       to Christ, page 93. (Emphasis supplied.) Thus there are at
                       least four ways in which God speaks to us today individually.
                          Sometimes God has used more direct ways of communicat-
                       ing with people.
                          Through whom did God warn Lot? Gen. 19:1-3, 12, 13. See
                       also Heb. 1:14.
                          From time to time members of the human family have enter-
                       tained angels (Heb. 13:2) and communed with them as they
                       brought some message from heaven to the inhabitants of earth.
                       Christ and two angels appeared in person to Abraham. Gen.
                       18:1, 2, 22, 33; Patriarchs and Prophets, pages 138, 139. Com-
                       pare Judges 6:11, 12; 13:3, 8, 9; Luke 1:11, 19, 26, 27.
                         What means did God use to warn Pharaoh of coming
                       famine? Gen. 41:1-7.

                          God at times communicated through dreams to persons who
                       were not prophets, giving some specific information or warn-
                       ing. See Gen. 40:5; Dan. 2:1; 4:4, 5; Matt. 2:13, 14. These
                       divinely given dreams did not make the one who dreamed
                       them a prophet.
 THINK IT THROUGH         Did you ever know of an instance where a dream had reli-
                       gious significance? How can you be sure of the source of such
                       dreams?

    THE URIM AND will to ancient Israel through the high priest?
        THUMMIM    "And Aaron shall bear the names of the children of Israel
                    in the breastplate of judgment upon his heart, when he goeth
                    in unto the holy place, for a memorial before the Lord con-
                    tinually. And thou shalt put in the breastplate of judgment
                    the Urim and the Thummim; and they shall be upon Aaron's
                    heart, when he goeth in before the Lord: and Aaron shall
                    bear the judgment of the children of Israel upon his heart
                    before the Lord continually." Ex. 28:29, 30.
                         See also Lev. 8:8.
                         In Unger's Bible Dictionary the following note appears on
                    page 1128: "These [the Urim and Thummim] formed the me-
                    dium through which the high priest ascertained the will of
                    Jehovah in regard to any important matter affecting the theoc-
                    racy (Num. 27:21). Even such early writers as Josephus, Philo,
                    and the Rabbins are unable to furnish any precise information
                    as to what the Urim and Thummin really were. On every side
                    we meet with confessions of ignorance."
                         But Ellen White wrote: "At the right and left of the breast-
                    plate were two large stones of great brilliancy. These were
                    known as the Urim and Thummim. By them the will of God
                    was made knoWn through the high priest. When questions
                    were brought for decision before the Lord, a halo of light encir-
                    cling the precious stone at the right was a token of the divine
                    consent or approval, while a cloud shadowing the stone at
                    the left was an evidence of denial or disapprobation."—Patri-
                    archs and Prophets, page 351.
                          Dr. Unger remarks, however, that "in Urim, Hebrew scholars,
                    with hardly an exception, have seen the plural of ur (light or
                    fire). . . . The literal English equivalent would of course be
                     'lights.' "—Unger's Bible Dictionary, page 1128.

 THINK IT THROUGH     Does God always reveal His will to His people on every
                    essential subject? When I wish to know God's will for me
                    personally, what should I do?
                       "Those who decide to do nothing in any line that will dis-
                    please God, will know, after presenting their case before Him,
                    just what course to pursue. And they will receive not only
                    wisdom, but strength. Power for obedience, for service, will be
                    imparted to them, as Christ has promised. Whatever was given
                    to Christ—the 'all things' to supply the need of fallen men—
                    was given to Him as the head and representative of humanity.
                    And 'whatsoever we ask, we receive of Him, because we keep
                    His commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in
                    His sight.' 1 John 3:22."—The Desire of Ages, page 668.

      THE PROPHETIC
                          "He that prophesieth edifieth the church." 1 Cor. 14:4.
           CHANNEL
                           "First of all, what is prophecy? Don't be too quick to an-
                       swer that prophecy is simply 'foretelling the future before it
                       happens.' For while this is certainly an important phase of
                       prophecy, it is not the only phase. The word 'prophecy' comes
                       from two Greek parts: pro means 'forth' or `before;' phemi
                       means 'to speak'—that is, in advance—or, 'to speak forth'—
                       that is, to announce something in front of other people. Proph-
                       ecy, therefore, is the speaking forth of the revealed mind of
                       God whether this utterance pertains to the present or to the
                       future."—Henry Herbert Ehrenstein, Eternity, August, 1966.
                           While the prophet's main function is to serve the church
                       as the Lord's spokesman, his work is not limited to the chil-
                       dren of God. Jonah and Daniel, for example, were God's
                       prophets, but they spoke portions of their messages to the
                       Gentile world.
                           "Prophecy is the revelation of the will of God by a man or
                       woman who is God's chosen spokesman. The prophet stands
                       first before God to discern His will, and then stands before
                       men to declare that divine will."—Henry H. Ehrenstein, Eternity,
                       August, 1966.
                         By what means did God commonly impart His messages to
                       prophets? Num. 12:6; Hosea 12:10.

                          "The Infinite One by His Holy Spirit has shed light into the
                       minds and hearts of His servants. He has given dreams and
                       visions, symbols and figures; and those to whom the truth was
                       thus revealed have themselves embodied the thought in human
                       language."—The Great Controversy, Introduction, page v.

 THINK IT THROUGH        Read the first part of Isaiah 66:5. Then ask yourself the
                       question, What is my attitude toward the messages of the
                       Bible prophets? What is your answer?

                            "God has been pleased to communicate His truth to the
                       world by human agencies, and He Himself, by His Holy Spirit,
                       qualified men and enabled them to do this work. He guided
                       the mind in the selection of what to speak and what to write.

           Part 6   What does the prophet Joel say about prophetic guidance
 MODERN GUIDANCE in the last days?
                       "And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out
                    my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters
                    shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your
                    young men shall see visions." "The sun shall be turned into
                    darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the
                    terrible day of the Lord come." Joel 2:28, 31.
                       "In immediate connection with the scenes of the great day
                    of God, the Lord by the prophet Joel has promised a special
                    manifestation of His Spirit. Joel 2:28. This prophecy received
                    a partial fulfillment in the outpouring of the Spirit on the Day
                    of Pentecost; but it will reach its full accomplishment in the
                    manifestation of divine grace which will attend the closing
                    work of the gospel."—The Great Controversy, Introduction,
                    page ix.
                       What is one important characteristic of the people of God
                    in the last days? Rev. 12:17; 19:10.
                       "The expression 'spirit of prophecy' refers specifically to
                    the 'manifestation of the Spirit' in the form of a special gift
                    of the Holy Spirit that inspires the recipient and enables him
                    to speak authoritatively as a representative of God (1 Cor. 12:
                    7-10) when 'moved by the Holy Ghost' to do so (2 Peter 1:21).
                    The context of the expression in Rev. 19:10 defines 'the testi-
                    mony of Jesus' and 'the spirit of prophecy' in this sense. In
                    view of the fact that the 'remnant' of ch. 12:17 specifically
                    refers to the church after the close of the 1260 prophetic days
                    of vs. 6 and 14, that is, after 1798 . . . , ch. 12:17 stands as
                    a clear prediction of the special manifestation of the 'spirit,'
                    or 'gift,' of prophecy in the church in our day. Seventh-day
                    Adventists believe the ministry of Ellen G. White meets the
                    specifications of Rev. 12:17 in a unique way."—SDA Bible

                    by Jesus Christ? 1 Cor. 1:4-7.

 THINK IT THROUGH     Why should the church today especially need divine guid-
                    ance?
                       "When the apostles of Christ were to bear His gospel to the
                    world and to record it for all future ages, they were especially
                    endowed with the enlightenment of the Spirit. . . . At this time
                    [the final conflict] the special endowment of divine grace and
                    power is not less needful to the church than in apostolic days."

   "And the Lord took me as I followed the
flock, and the Lord said unto me, Go, proph-
esy unto my people Israel." Amos 7:15.


    "The prophet is a person supernaturally
called and qualified as a spokesman for God.
. . . The prophet was in a special sense God's
official representative to His people on earth.
. . . The prophet was chiefly a teacher of righ-
teousness, spirituality, and ethical conduct, a
moral reformer bearing messages of instruc-
tion, counsel, admonition, warning, whose
work often included the prediction of future
events. . . .
    "A prophet first received instruction from
the Lord and then conveyed it to the people.
These 2 aspects of the prophet's work were
reflected in the names by which prophets were
known in OT times: seer (chozeh or ro'eh ) and
prophet (nabi'). The title of seer was more
common in the earlier period of Hebrew his-
tory (1 Sa 9:9). The •term used more frequently
in the OT was nabi', 'prophet,' which desig-
nated him as God's spokesman. As a 'seer' the
prophet discerned God's will, and as 'prophet'
he conveyed it to others."—SDA Bible Dic-

             Part 1   What were the circumstances of Isaiah's call to his pro-
           THE CALL phetic office and who gave him his message?
                        "Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I
                     send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send
                     me. And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed,
                     but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not."
                     Isa. 6:8, 9.

                         The prophet did not choose his own work. His brethren did
                     not elect or appoint him to this important office. The prophetic
                     gift was not handed down from father to son. "The call to pro-
                     phetic office, and the accompanying bestowal of the prophetic
                     gift, were acts of God, as in the case of Isaiah (ch 6:8, 9),
                     Jeremiah (ch 1:5), Ezekiel (ch 2:3-5), and Amos (ch 7:15). Moses
                     received his call at the burning bush (Ex 3:1 to 4:17).
                     . . . Accompanying the prophetic call was a special endow-
                     ment qualifying the prophet to speak for God. This call con-
                     stituted each prophet a 'watchman' over the house of Israel
                     (see Eze 33:7), and made the prophet strictly accountable to
                     God for faithfully delivering the messages he was commis-
                     sioned to bear (vs 3, 6)."—SDA Bible Dictionary, page 881.

                       How did Elijah announce Elisha's call to be his successor?
                     1 Kings 19:19-21. See 2 Kings 2:13, 14.

                        "As Elijah, divinely directed in seeking a successor, passed
                     the field in which Elisha was plowing, he cast upon the young
                     man's shoulders the mantle of consecration. . . . The Spirit
                     of God impressed Elisha's heart as to the meaning of the
                     prophet's act. To him it was the signal that God had called
                     him to be the successor of Elijah. . . .
                        "Elisha understood the meaning of the call. He knew it
                     was from God, and he did not hesitate to obey. . . . Without
                     hesitation he left a home where he was beloved, to attend the
                     prophet in his uncertain life."—Prophets and Kings, pages 219,

 THINK IT THROUGH      What kind of people hear and obey the call of heaven?
                     Does the Lord expect from all the same kind of service?

                        "The call to place all on the altar of service comes to each
                     one. We are not all asked to serve as Elisha served, nor are
                     we all bidden to sell everything we have; but God asks us to
                     give His service the first place in our lives, to allow no day to
                     pass without doing something to advance His work in the
                     earth."—Prophets and Kings, page 221.

The Prophet's Call     Lesson 2                                       ❑  Monday
                                                                        October 7


           Part 2   What was God's message to Jeremiah when called to the
       JEREMIAH'S prophetic office?
      COMMISSION    "Then the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Before
                    I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou
                    camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained
                    thee a prophet unto the nations. . . . Then the Lord put
                    forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And the Lord said
                    unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth." Jer.
                    1:4, 5, 9.
                       Credentials are those things that give "title to credit or
                    confidence." What was it about Jeremiah that warranted the
                    confidence of the people of Judah? Jeremiah's "vocation was
                    his, not by human choice, but by virtue of a direct commission
                    from God. The deep sense of the divine call was the driving
                    force of his ministry and his support and stay in moments of
                    discouragement against the hostility of his people."—SDA Bible
                    Commentary, on Jer. 1:4.
                       To whom does the Lord often turn to do His work? 1 Cor.
                     1:26-31.
                       Ellen White humbly wrote concerning her call in her youth
                    to serve as God's messenger to His people: "My Saviour
                    declared me to be His messenger. 'Your work,' He instructed
                    me, 'is to bear . . . the message to the erring ones, to carry
                    the word before unbelievers, and with pen and voice to reprove
                    from the Word actions that are not right."—Selected Messages,
                    Bk. 1, p. 32.
                       In an ancient school the students had a three-years course.
                    In the first year they were called the wise men; in the second
                    they were called the philosophers, those who wished to be
                    wise men; in the third year they were called the disciples,
                    learners.
                       It is from among humble men and women who are willing
                    to receive divine instruction that God calls His messengers to
                    serve His church. Is today any different from Jeremiah's time?

 THINK IT THROUGH      What was Jeremiah's principal qualification for prophetic
                     office? See Jeremiah 1:6, 7. What could be said of Ellen
                     White at the time she was called?
                         "God can use every person just in proportion as He can put
                     His Spirit into the soul temple. The work that He will accept
                     is the work that reflects His image. His followers are to bear,
                     as their credentials to the world, the ineffaceable character-
                     istics of His immortal principles."—The Ministry of Healing,

               Part 3 Who is the earliest prophet mentioned in the Bible?
     THE GIFT IN THE  "And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of
     OLD TESTAMENT these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of
                     his saints, to execute judgment upon all." Jude 14, 15 (first
                     part).
                        "Enoch was the first prophet among mankind. He foretold
                     by prophecy the second coming of Christ to our world, and his
                     work at that time. . . . His prophecy is not found in the writ-
                     ings of the Old Testament. We may never find any books
                     which relate to the works of Enoch, but Jude, a prophet of
                     God, mentions the work of Enoch."—Ellen G. White Comments,
                     SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 1, p. 1088.
                       What is said concerning the word of the Lord in the days of
                     Samuel? 1 Sam. 3:1.
                        The Revised Standard Version reads: "And the word of the
                     Lord was rare in those days; there was no frequent vision."
                     Yet there is the record of a solemn message delivered to Eli
                     from the "Lord the God of Israel," through a "man of God."
                     1 Sam. 2:27-36.
                       What gift did God entrust to Daniel? Dan. 1:17 (last part).
                        "While Daniel clung to his God with unwavering trust, the
                     Spirit of prophetic power came upon him. While he was
                     instructed of man in the duties of court life, he was taught of
                     God to read the mysteries of future ages and to present to
                     coming generations, through figures and similitudes, the won-
                     derful things that would come to pass in the last days."—The
                     Sanctified Life, page 24.
                        Were those prophets inspired whose writings were not in-
                     cluded in the Old Testament canon? 1 Chron. 29:29; 2 Chron.
                     9:29.
                         "During the ages while the Scriptures of both the Old and
                     the New Testament were being given, the Holy Spirit did not
                     cease to communicate light to individual minds, apart from
                     the revelations to be embodied in the Sacred Canon. . . . Men-
                     tion is made [in the Bible] of prophets in different ages, of
                     whose utterances nothing is recorded. In like manner, after
                     the close of the canon of the Scripture, the Holy Spirit was
                     still to continue its work, to enlighten, warn, and comfort the
                     children of God."—The Great Controversy, Introduction, page

             Part 4 Who was the greatest spokesman for God?
   THE GIFT IN THE
                    "God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spoke in
   NEW TESTAMENT time past unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last
                    days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir
                    of all things, by whom also he made the worlds." Heb. 1:1, 2.
                       See also John 6:14.
                        Christ referred to Himself as a prophet. Matt. 13:53-57. He
                    fulfilled the prophecy of Deuteronomy 18:15, 18. The multitude
                    who were fed by the loaves and fishes recognized in the mir-
                    acle-working Christ the Messiah-Prophet that "should come."
                    Matt. 11:3. Like all prophets before and since, He spake for
                    God and on His behalf. Indeed, He spoke as God, the supreme
                    revelation of divinity. And note that in Jesus' messages the
                    predictive element was prominent. See Matthew 24; Mark 13;
                    Luke 21.
                        "Who, but Jesus Christ by His Spirit and divine power,
                    guided the pens of the sacred historians that to the world
                    might be presented the precious record of the sayings and
                    works of Jesus Christ?"—Ellen G. White, Manuscript 1, 1892.

                      In whom was the prophetic gift exercised in early New
                    Testament times? Luke 2:25-38. See also Luke 1:67-79.

                       Paul indicated that the gift of prophecy would remain in the
                     Christian church till the close of time. Eph. 4:11-13.

                       How did Paul receive divine revelations? 2 Cor. 12:1-4.

                         "The apostle Paul early in his Christian experience was
                     given special opportunities to learn the will of God concerning
                     the followers of Jesus. He was 'caught up to the third heaven,'
                     'into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not
                     lawful for a man to utter.' He himself acknowledged that many
                     'visions and revelations' had been given him 'of the Lord.' His
                     understanding of the . principles of gospel truth was equal to
                     that of 'the very chiefest apostles.' . . .
                         "The impression that he received when in vision was ever
                     with him, enabling him to give a correct representation of
                     Christian character. By word of mouth and by letter he bore a
                     message that ever since has brought help and strength to the
                      church of God."—The Acts of the Apostles, pages 469, 470.

                     the prophet?

             Part 5    Did Elijah's call to the prophetic office remove his human-
      THE PROPHETS' ity from him?
          HUMANITY     "Elias [Elijah] was a man subject to like passions as we
                     are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it
                     rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six
                     months." James 5:17.

                        Prophets are human beings, and God only is infallible. God
                     calls the prophet to reveal the divine message. The instruction
                     received exerts a positive influence on his own life, but he is
                     not deprived of thinking ordinary thoughts or of conversing on
                     topics of everyday interest. He may make mistakes as did
                     Peter (see Gal. 2:11-14), or complain to God as did Jeremiah
                     (see Jer. 12:1; 15:15-18), but this does not invalidate the divine
                     message he bears for God. In her day Ellen White lived an
                     exemplary life, but she said concerning herself: "In regard to
                     infallibility, I never claimed it; God alone is infallible."—Se-
                     lected Messages, Bk. 1, p. 37.

                         Commenting on this text, *Joseph Priestly remarks: " 'It
                     pleased God to distinguish several women with the spirit of
                     prophecy, as well as other great attainments, to shew that, in
                     his sight, and especially in things of a spiritual nature, there
                      is no essential pre-eminence in the male sex.'—Notes on All the
                      Books of Scripture, vol. 2, p. 40." (Quoted by W. E. Read in
                      The Bible, the Spirit of Prophecy, and the Church, page 110.)
                          When Ellen White [then Ellen Harmon] was just a young
                     woman of seventeen—soon after her first vision—she wrote:
                         "As God has shown me in holy vision the travels of the
                     Advent people to the Holy City . . . , it may be my duty to
                     give you a short sketch of what God has revealed to me. . . .
                     I have tried to bring back a good report and a few grapes from
                     the heavenly Canaan, for which many would stone me, as the
                     congregation bade stone Caleb and Joshua for their report.
                     (Num. 14:10.) But I declare to you, my brethren and sisters in
                     the Lord, it is a goodly land, and we are well able to go up and
                     possess it."—Early Writings, pages 13, 14. (Written in April,
                     1846.)

 THINK IT THROUGH      Ellen White's sketch of her earliest vision was a "good re-
                     port," encouraging and full of hope for the future of the
                     advent people. Throughout her later messages this emphasis
                     runs like a golden thread.

            Part 6   How were the prophets and messengers of the Lord often
     THE PROPHETS treated?
  CRUELLY TREATED    "Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because
                     ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres
                     of the righteous, and say, If we had been in the days of our
                     fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the
                     blood of the prophets. Wherefore ye be witnesses unto your-
                     selves, that ye are the children of them which killed the
                     prophets." Matt. 23:29-31.

                        See also Acts 7:52.
                        Often the prophet was called upon to deliver unpleasant
                     messages of reproof or correction. At times he met a spirit of
                     retaliation and revenge. Early in her experience Ellen White
                     was confronted with an adverse reception of a message of
                     reproof. When instructed as to her duty she was told: " 'The
                     loss is not yours, but mine. God sees not as man sees. He lays
                     out the work that He would have done, and you do not know
                     which will prosper, this or that.' "—Testimonies, Vol. 2, p. 11.

                      How did Ahab respond to the solemn prophetic message

                        Was Ellen White's pathway always a pleasant one? She
                     wrote concerning her task: "From the beginning of my work, I
                     have been pursued by hatred, reproach, and falsehood. Base
                     imputations and slanderous reports have been greedily gath-
                     ered up and widely circulated by the rebellious, the formalist,
                     and the fanatic. . . .
                        "This warfare has been kept up for nearly forty years, but
                     I have not felt at liberty even to notice their vile speeches, re-
                     proaches, and insinuations. . .
                        "Jesus, the Majesty of heaven, He who was equal with God,
                     was in the world thirty-three years, and yet there were but few
                     who acknowledged His divine character. [See John 15:18-201
                      And can I, who am so weak, so unworthy, a frail creature of
                     humanity, expect greater success than was enjoyed by the
                      Saviour of the world?"—Selected Messages, Bk. 1, pp. 69, 70.

  THINK IT THROUGH       Can you think of reasons why the prophetic voice is
                      needed in modern times? What attitude to the prophetic
                      message do you assume? What reasons do people have for
                      ridiculing or persecuting the prophets of God?

 October 13-19

                   "And by a prophet the Lord brought Israel out
                 of Egypt, and by a prophet was he preserved."
                 Hosea 12:13.

                   From a study of the life and work of Bible


   scope         prophets one can observe the broad scope of
                 their spiritual activities. Beyond the immediate
                 and special functions of receiving visions and


      of         imparting light in sermons or written messages,
                 these inspired men spelled out by their holy lives-



     the
                 and example the high destiny of the church in
                 godly living and witnessing. Elijah and Elisha
                 were reformers and educators. Jeremiah, Nathan,


Prophet's        and John the Baptist were reprovers of sin. Isaiah
                 was a counselor; Paul and Peter, missionaries,
                 evangelists, and pastors; Ezekiel, a pastor and


    work         shepherd of God's exiled flock.
                   "All the instruction we need to guide us in this
                 life and to prepare us for the life to come has
                 been given us through the gift of prophecy. No
                 phase of life has been overlooked. The messages
                 which the Spirit 'moved' the prophets to write
                 provide a basis for our every decision. However,
                 the principles have not been stated theoretically
                 and catalogued so we may use the Scriptures like
                 a dictionary or encyclopedia without having read
                 the whole book and made its ideas our own. Most
                 of the principles have been illustrated in life situa-
                 tions. It is left with us to study the situations and
                 the way God dealt with human beings, to dis-
                 cover the principles involved, and to apply them
                 to our life in comparable situations....
                    "No matter what question or problem faces
                 us, God has communicated enough knowledge
                 of His will to guide our understanding and de-
                 cision if we allow the Holy Spirit to lead us."—
                 T. H. Jemison, Christian Beliefs, page 55.

              Part 1      What does God reveal to His prophets?
        A PREDICTOR
                          "Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his
                       secret unto his servants the prophets." Amos 3:7.

                           "Surely the Lord God will do nothing] in reference to the
                       punishment, correction, or blessing of his people—
                          "But he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.]
                       They are in strict correspondence with him, and he shows
                       them things to come. Such secrets of God are revealed to
                       them, that they may inform the people; that, by repentance
                       and conversion, they may avoid the evil, and, by walking closely
                       with God, secure the continuance of his favour."—Clarke's
                       Commentary, Vol. 4, p. 677.
                          The prophets of God often announced to the sinful people of
                       Israel and Judah God's "secrets" as threatenings of wrath and
                       promises of blessing. These were all conditional prophecies or
                       predictions, and the predictive work of the prophets was largely
                       of this character. The prophet, however, is more than a fore-
                       caster. He speaks for God as His representative and opens
                       up the "secret" intentions and purposes of the divine mind.
                          Numerous predictions were made by the Bible prophets
                       meeting fulfillment in local events, e.g., Jeremiah's forecast
                       of the death of Hananiah (Jer. 38:12-17) and Simeon's predic-
                       tion concerning the work Jesus would do and the sorrow that
                       would pierce Mary's heart. Luke 2:34, 35. Predictions were
                       also made that met fulfillment in sweeping events of secular
                       and church history. Some illustrations of these are found in
                       Daniel 2 and 7; Matthew 24; Mark 13; Luke 21. The predictions
                       of Ellen White were of both kinds. See Testimonies, Vol. 8, pp.
                       97-103; The Great Controversy, pages 464, 644.

 THINK IT THROUGH         The prophecies of God's judgments are fulfilled unless
                       changes come in the parties concerned. Our actions have
                       something to do with altering God's purposes. Does this rep-
                       resent mercy or instability on God's part? In whom does the
                       instability lie?

                           On every package sent out by a certain printer in a large
                       city of the eastern United States is an impressive trademark.
                       It is simply a circle within which is his name and the words "I
                       never disappoint." Every promise the Lord ever made might
                       well bear that mark.

                                                                       October 14

            Part 2     What was Moses' work as Israel's prophet?
   A VARIED WORK       "And by a prophet the Lord brought Israel out of Egypt,
                     and by a prophet was he preserved." Hosea 12:13.
                        Moses made few predictions regarding the future, but he
                     was "a prophet," used of God to lead Israel and to protect
                     them from Satan's deceptions and from their enemies. Not all
                     who were called to the prophetic office did the same type of
                     work. John the Baptist performed no miracles, but he was sent
                     to prepare the way of the Lord. Jesus declared that John was
                     a prophet and that "there hath not risen a greater than John
                     the Baptist." Matt. 11:9, 11. Samuel's work was largely one
                     of spiritual guidance.
                       What was the first great truth revealed in Moses' writings?
                     Gen. 1:1.
                        "The preparation of the written word began in the time of
                     Moses. Inspired revelations were then embodied in an inspired
                     book. This work continued during the long period of sixteen
                     hundred years—from Moses, the historian of creation and the
                     law, to John, the recorder of the most sublime truths of the
                     gospel."—The Great Controversy, Introduction, page v.
                       From what source did Moses receive the various statutes
                     and precepts given to the children of Israel? Deut. 4:1, 2, 5.
                         "Moses was commanded to write, as God should bid him,
                     judgments and laws giving minute instruction as to what was
                     required. These directions relating to the duty of the people to
                     God, to one another, and to the stranger were only the princi-
                     ples of the Ten Commandments amplified and given in a spe-
                     cific manner, that none need err."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
                     page 364.
                         In Testimonies, Vol. 2, p. 608 Ellen White describes the
                     nature of the Lord's instruction through her for Israel today.
                     "It is to come down to the minutiae of life, keeping the feeble
                     faith from dying, and pressing home upon believers the neces-
                     sity of shining as lights in the world."

  THINK IT THROUGH      In what specific ways have the prophets' testimonies influ-
                      enced me most?
                        "If the people who now profess to be God's peculiar trea-
                      sure would obey His requirements, as specified in His word,
                      special testimonies would not be given to awaken them to their
                      duty and impress upon them their sinfulness and their fearful
                      danger in neglecting to obey the word of God."—Testimonies,

              Part 3  What Old Testament incident reveals the prophet as an
        AN EDUCATOR educator, living and working with his students?
                       "And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now,
                     the place where we dwell with thee is too strait for us. Let us
                     go, we pray thee, unto Jordan, and take thence every man a
                     beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell.
                     And he answered, Go ye. And one said, Be content, I pray
                     thee, and go with thy servants. And he answered, I will go."
                     2 Kings 6:1-3.

                         "The schools of the prophets were founded by Samuel to
                      serve as a barrier against the widespread corruption, to pro-
                      vide for the moral and spiritual welfare of the youth, and to
                      promote the future prosperity of the nation by furnishing it with
                      men qualified to act in the fear of God as leaders and coun-
                      selors."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 593.
                         The basic testimony on Christian education and church
                     schools among Seventh-day Adventists appeared in 1872.
                     Ellen White's counsel on education throughout her life may be
                      summarized as follows:
                         Build schools where youth can be taught the Bible. Train
                     the hand and the head as well as the heart. Give them a
                     well-balanced training. Teach them how to live for this world
                     and to prepare for the next. And let this good work be ex-
                     tended to all the world.
                         In the book Education Ellen White wrote: "To restore in
                     man the image of his Maker, to bring him back to the perfec-
                     tion in which he was created, to promote the development of
                     body, mind, and soul, that the divine purpose in his creation
                     might be realized—this was to be the work of redemption. This
                     is the object of education, the great object of life."—Education,
                     pages 15, 16.

                       What was often the result of the messages of Jeremiah?
                     Jer. 29:19; 32:33.

                         Jeremiah's experience is illustrative of the experience of
                     other prophets. They acted as guides and teachers of the
                     people in doctrine and right living, though often their work
                     was frowned upon by the careless and the guilty. The proph-
                     et's voice was God's call to higher, holier living.

 THINK IT THROUGH       What is the relation of redemption to education? How long
                     does the educational and redemptive work of God continue
                     in our lives?

           Part 4     What is a difficult yet most important feature of the proph-
A REPROVER OF SIN et's work as illustrated in Jeremiah's commission?
                      "Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak
                    unto them all that I command thee: be not dismayed at their
                    faces, lest I confound thee before them. For, behold, I have
                    made thee this day a defenced city, and an iron pillar, and
                    brasen walls against the whole land, against the kings of
                    Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof,
                    and against the people of the land." Jer. 1:17, 18.

                       Ellen White was conscious that her work as God's messen-
                    ger included the role of a moral reformer: "I have not come to
                    cry peace; you can hear this voice wherever you go. There are
                    those who will be glad to lull you to sleep in your carnal se-
                    curity; but I have a different work. My message is to alarm
                    you, to bid you reform your lives, and cease your rebellion
                    against the God of the universe. Take the Word of God, and
                    see if you are in harmony with it. Is your character such as
                    will bear the search of the heavenly investigation? Remember,
                    Jesus says: 'Not everyone that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall
                    enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will
                    of my Father which is in heaven.' "—Ellen G. White, Review
                    and Herald, June 22, 1911. See Testimonies, Vol. 4, pp. 12, 13.

                      What are the thoughts that God thinks "toward" His peo-
                    ple? Jer. 29:11-14.

                      Judah, because of her sin, was to go into captivity. But the
                    Lord would bring the people back again—first to Himself and
                    second to their Judean homes. Thus the prophet's messages
                    would be first a reproof for sin and forecast of judgment and
                    second a harbinger of deliverance.

                      Are the prophetic messages of rebuke an omen of rejection
                    or a call to accept God's love? Rev. 3:19.

 THINK IT THROUGH     Would it not be well for us today to put ourselves in the
                    place of ancient Israel and Judah and ask: Would we have
                    done as they did under the circumstances? Is God's rebuke
                    the same as God's rejection?

                       "The experience of Israel, . . . as recorded in the one
                    hundred fifth and one hundred sixth psalms, contains lessons
                    of warning that the people of God in these last days especially
                    need to study. I urge that these chapters be read at least
                    once every week."—Testimonies to Ministers, pages 98, 99.

Scope of the Prophet's Work         LESSON 3                            ❑ Thursday
                                                                         October 17

               Part 5   "Why did Zechariah endorse and reemphasize the messages
         RELATION TO of "former prophets"?
     PRIOR PROPHETS     "Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets
                     have cried, saying, Thus saith the Lord of hosts; Turn ye now
                     from your evil ways, and from your evil doings: but they did
                     not hear, nor hearken unto me, saith the Lord." Zech. 1:4.

                         Read Zech. 1:3-6; 7:7-14. Compare 1 Cor. 14:37.
                         The prophetic writings show a remarkable agreement, each
                     of the prophets being under the control of the Spirit of God.
                     In Bible times contemporary prophets studied what "the former
                     prophets" had written. Dan. 9:2. In the Ellen White writings
                     the messages of the Bible prophets were exalted and magni-
                     fied so that the beauty of truth stood out. This is a distinct
                     mark of a genuine messenger of God.
                         "The Testimonies are not to belittle the word of God, but to
                     exalt it and attract minds to it, that the beautiful simplicity of
                     truth may impress all."—Testimonies, Vol. 2, p. 606.
                        Stephen Haskell, early Bible teacher and administrator of
                     the church, wrote concerning this aspect of the prophet's work:
                         "What are some of the unmistakable fruits by which a true
                     prophet may be recognized? The testimony of every true
                     prophet will agree with the testimony of the prophets of God
                     before him, and it may be a further development of the same
                     truth uttered by them . . . 'as silver tried in a furnace of
                     earth, purified seven times.' "

 THINK IT THROUGH       Compare the contemporary and the prior prophets. Are
                     they rivals? Do they compete, each for a following of his
                     own? Or does the true contemporary prophet confirm the
                     faith of the church in the revelations of "the former prophets,"
                     magnifying them and showing their relevance for today? See
                     1 Cor. 14:32.

                        "If you lose confidence in the testimonies you will drift away
                     from Bible truth."—Testimonies, Vol. 5, p. 98.
                        "The testimonies of His Spirit call your attention to the
                     Scriptures, point out your defects of character, and rebuke
                     your sins; therefore you do not heed them. And to justify
                     your carnal, ease-loving course you begin to doubt whether
                     the testimonies are from God. If you would obey their teach-
                     ings you would be assured of their divine origin. Remember,
                     your unbelief does not affect their truthfulness. If they are from
                     God they will stand."—Testimonies, Vol. 5, p. 234.

           Part 6   What message may be considered as summing up the over-
 REVIVAL MESSAGE all objective of the messages of the prophets?
                       "Therefore thus will I do unto thee, 0 Israel: and because
                    I will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, 0 Israel."
                    Amos 4:12.

                       "Prepare to meet thy God" was the consuming burden of
                    Amos to his backslidden people. It is the message of the
                    prophets through all time including the last days. The first
                    Testimony pamphlet published in 1855 closed with an article
                    entitled, "Prepare to Meet the Lord."—Testimonies, Vol. 1, pp.
                    123-126. In the last article in the ninth volume of the Testi-
                    monies, published forty-four years later, in 1909, the same pen
                    urges:
                       "My brother, my sister, I urge you to prepare for the coming
                    of Christ in the clouds of heaven. Day by day cast the love of
                    the world out of your hearts. Understand by experience what
                    it means to have fellowship with Christ. Prepare for the judg-
                    ment, that when Christ shall come, to be admired in all them
                    that believe, you may be among those who will meet Him in
                    peace."—Testimonies, Vol. 9, p. 285.
                        The messages of Elijah the prophet to apostate Israel, of
                    John the Baptist to the Jews in Christ's time, and of Seventh-
                    day Adventists to the world today are alike. The call to prepare
                    to meet God is sounding now. Are we giving this message
                    effectively? Personally?

 THINK IT THROUGH      What is involved in preparation to meet God face to face?
                    This call by the prophet implies basic needs for chcinge in our
                    lives. Will the study of the nine volumes of the "Testimonies"
                    help us to discern these needs?

                       " 'Prepare to meet thy God' (Amos 4:12), is the warning to
                    be given to the world. It is a warning to us individually. We are
                    called upon to lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth
                    so easily beset us. There is a work for you, my brother, to do,
                    to yoke up with Christ. Make sure that your building is on the
                    rock. Do not risk eternity on a probability. You may not live
                    to participate in the perilous scenes on which we are now
                    entering. The life of no one of us is assured for any given
                    time. Should you not watch every moment? . . .
                       "Are my sins pardoned through faith in Christ? Have I been
                    born again? Am I complying with the invitation, 'Come unto
                    me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you

"While I was praying at the family altar, the Holy
 Ghost fell upon me, and I seemed to be rising higher
 and higher, far above the dark world. I turned to
look for the Advent people in the world, but could
 not find them, when a voice said to me, `Look again,
and look a little higher.' At this I raised my eyes,
and saw a straight and narrow path, cast up high
above the world. On this path the Advent people
 were traveling to the city, which was at the farther
end of the path."—Early Writings, page 14.
"After I came out of vision, everything looked
changed; a gloom was spread over all that I beheld.
Oh, how dark this world looked to me. I wept when
I found myself here, and felt homesick. I had seen
a better world, and it had spoiled this for me. I told
the view to our little band in Portland, who then
 fully believed it to be of God. That was a powerful
time. The solemnity of eternity rested upon us."—

AnO OReams
   "And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you, I the
Lord will make myself known unto him in a vision, and will speak unto him in
a dream." Num. 12:6.

    God spoke to the prophet through visions. No one rule can be laid down
concerning the manner in which the visions were given or the way in which
the light was conveyed to the prophet. The words of Hebrews 1:1—"God, who
at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by
the prophets"—take on special significance.
    The SDA Bible Dictionary defines the prophetic "vision" as follows: "A super-
natural means by which God communicates His will to His servants the prophets
(Is 1:1, etc)       A vision may come in waking moments (Dan 10:7; Acts 9:3, 7),
by day (Acts 10:3) or night (Gen 46:2), or it may come as a dream (Num 12:6).
The Bible makes no sharp distinction between visions and dreams, except pos-
sibly that dreams come during hours of slumber. In vision the prophet becomes
oblivious of his natural surroundings and the Spirit of God so controls the
sensory areas of his brain that the prophet seems literally to see, hear, and
feel what is presented to him in vision. A vision may contain instruction for
God's people, or reveal facts about the future that will enable God's people to
 live more intelligently in the present. In vision the prophet sometimes seems to
 be transported over considerable distances (see Eze 3:12-15; 8:3; 40:2; cf. 2 Cor
12:2-4)."—Art. "Vision," pages 1134, 1135.
     Throughout Ellen White's long ministry of seventy years (1845-1915) revela-
 tions came to her in visions of the day and visions of the night. The light thus
 communicated to her by God she embodied in her addresses, numerous periodi-
 cal articles, hundreds of personal, written testimonies, and in her many pub-
 lished books—at the present time about sixty in English.

             Part 1  How did God say He would communicate with one whom
 GOD-GIVEN VISIONS He chose to be a prophet?

                        "And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet
                     among you, I the Lord will make myself known unto him in a
                     vision, and will speak unto him in a dream." Num. 12:6.

                        See also Gen. 15:1.
                       Under what circumstances was Ezekiel given a vivid vision?
                     Ezek. 8:1, 3, 4.

                        Ellen White's experience in vision was similar to that of
                     Ezekiel. Often her visions were given while she was in the
                     presence of others. She also received light from God in the
                     dreams of the night season. She wrote:
                         "As inquiries are frequently made as to my state in vision,
                     and after I come out, I would say that when the Lord sees fit
                     to give a vision, I am taken into the presence of Jesus and
                     angels, and am entirely lost to earthly things. I can see no
                     farther than the angel directs me. My attention is often di-
                     rected to scenes transpiring upon earth.
                        "At times I am carried far ahead into the future and shown
                     what is to take place. Then again I am shown things as they
                     have occurred in the past. After I come out of vision I do not
                     at once remember all that I have seen, and the matter is not
                     so clear before me until I write, then the scene rises before me
                     as was presented in vision, and I can write with freedom.
                     Sometimes the things which I have seen are hid from me after
                     I come out of vision, and I cannot call them to mind until I am
                     brought before a company where that vision applies, then the
                     things which I have seen come to my mind with force."—
                     Spiritual Gifts, Vol. 2, pp. 292, 293.

 THINK IT THROUGH      What is the difference between the dream of a prophet
                     and the ordinary dream of the average person? How may
                     one recognize a divinely inspired dream?

                         "The multitude of dreams arise from the common things of
                     life, with which the Spirit of God has nothing to do. There are
                     also false dreams, as well as false visions, which are inspired
                     by the spirit of Satan. But dreams from the Lord are classed
                     in the word of God with visions and are as truly the fruits of
                     the spirit of prophecy as visions. Such dreams, taking into the
                     account the persons who have them and the circumstances
                     under which they are given, contain their own proofs of their

           Part 2  What changes did Daniel note in himself in connection with
     VISIONS AND one of his visions?
        PHYSICAL   "And I Daniel alone saw the vision. . . . And there re-
      PHENOMENA mained no strength in me: for my comeliness was turned in
                    me into corruption, and I retained no strength." "As for me,
                    straightway there remained no strength in me, neither is
                    there breath left in me. Then there came again and touched
                    me one like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened
                    me." Dan. 10:7, 8, 17, 18.

                      How is the experience of another prophet described? Num.
                    24:2-4.
                       "Falling into a trance, but having his eyes open. Literally,
                    'falling down and his eyes uncovered.' The words 'into a
                    trance' are supplied. The meaning seems to be that he fell
                    down on his face on the ground, but that his eyes remained
                    open. . . . Compare the experience of Saul (1 Sam. 19:23, 24),
                    of Ezekiel (Eze. 1:28), of Daniel (Dan. 8:17, 18; 10:8-19), of
                    John (Rev. 1:17). . . . It is certainly true that in whatever
                    position his body may have been, whether prostrate or upright,
                    his natural senses were held inoperative and his sensory per-
                    ception was controlled by the Spirit of God."—SDA Bible Com-

                      What does Paul say about his experience while in one of
                    his visions? 2 Cor. 12:1-4.

                       "In his visions Paul saw many things not lawful for a man to
                    utter. But many other things which he saw in the heavenly

        EXPERIENCE
                       reported physical phenomena paralleling the experience of
          IN VISION    Daniel.
                           "They [the visions] generally, but not always, occur in the
                       midst of earnest seasons of religious interest while the Spirit
                       of God is specially present. . . . The time Mrs. White is in
                       this condition has varied from fifteen minutes to one hundred
                       and eighty. During this time the heart and pulse continue to
                       beat, the eyes are always wide open, and seem to be gazing
                       at some far-distant object, and are never fixed on any person
                       or thing in the room. They are always directed upward. They
                       exhibit a pleasant expression. There is no ghastly look or any
                       resemblance of fainting. . . .
                           "While she is in vision, her breathing entirely ceases. No
                       breath ever escapes her nostrils or lips when in this condition.
                       This has been proved by many witnesses, among them physi-
                       cians of skill, and themselves unbelievers in the visions, on
                       some occasions being appointed by a public congregation for
                       the purpose. . . . When she goes into this condition, there is
                       no appearance of swooning or faintness, her face retains its
                       natural color, and the blood circulates as usual. Often she
                       loses her strength temporarily and reclines or sits; but at other
                       times she stands up. She moves her arms gracefully, and often
                       her face is lighted up with radiance as though the glory of
                       Heaven rested upon her. She is utterly unconscious of every
                       thing going on around her, while she is in vision, having no
                       knowledge whatever of what is said and done in her presence."
                       —Review and Herald, June 9, 1874.
                           Neither in the Bible nor in the writings of Ellen White do we
                       find the physical phenomena cited as a test. It was an evi-
                       dence—one among many. To those who were eyewitnesses of
                       Mrs. White in vision, the experience was unforgettable and
                       inspired faith and built confidence in the gift. In the earlier
                       years of.her experience the visions were frequently given pub-
                       licly. In the later years (1884-1915) the visions were usually
                       given privately at night.

 THINK IT THROUGH        Were these manifestations natural or supernatural? Is it
                       possible to explain the visions of the Bible prophets, or of
                       God's messenger, Ellen White, by scientific methods?

           Part 4      During what hours did Daniel receive the vision described
 PROPHETIC NIGHT    in Daniel 7?
         VISIONS      "In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had
                    a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote
                    the dream, and told the sum of the matters. Daniel spake
                    and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four
                    winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea. . . . I saw in
                    the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came
                    with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days,
                    and they brought him near before him." Dan. 7:1, 2, 13.

                       Often while the prophet slept, and his mind was free from
                    what went on about him, God revealed truth to him in a
                    prophetic dream or vision of the night. "It does not seem pos-
                    sible to draw any very precise distinction between the pro-
                    phetic 'dream' and the prophetic 'vision.' In the case of . . .
                    Daniel (Dan. vii, 1), they seem to melt into each other."—

                    and Ecclesiastical Literature, Vol. 8, art. "Prophet," p. 646.
                      What other prophet received visions during the night? Acts
                    16:9. See also Gen. 46:2-4.
                       Ellen White was favored by God with approximately 2,000
                    revelations in dreams and visions, by day and by night, over a
                    period of seventy years.

THINK IT THROUGH       Did the validity of the revelation depend upon the hours
                    of the day or night when it was received? Did the presence
                    or absence of physical phenomena make any difference?

                         " 'It is Satan's plan to weaken the faith of God's people in
                    the Testimonies.' Satan knows how to make his attacks. He
                    works upon minds to excite jealousy and dissatisfaction toward
                    those at the head of the work. The gifts are next questioned;
                    then, of course, they have but little weight, and instruction
                    given through vision is disregarded.' Next follows skepticism
                    in regard to the vital points of our faith, the pillars of our posi-
                    tion, then doubt as to the Holy Scriptures, and then the down-
                    ward march to perdition. When the Testimonies, which were
                    once believed, are doubted and given up, Satan knows the
                    deceived ones will not stop at this; and he redoubles his efforts
                    till he launches them into open rebellion, which becomes in-
                    curable and ends in destruction.' By giving place to doubts
                    and unbelief in regard to the work of God, and by cherishing
                     feelings of distrust and cruel jealousies, they are preparing
                     themselves for complete deception.' "—Testimonies, Vol. 5, p.

                Part 5  By what means did God reveal to Ezekiel truths concerning
       REALITY OF THE the restored temple?
     PROPHETIC DREAM    "In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Is-
                      rael." "And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with

                      upon all that I shall shew thee." Ezek. 40:2, 4.

                         "In both dream and vision what carried religious significance
                      was the fact that the presentation did not come through the
                      ordinary sense channels, or as a product of the mind's con-
                      scious activity. On this account it was accepted as a revela-
                      tion from God. . . . The result is sometimes presented as if it
                      had come to the prophet in a manner analogous to sense ex-
                      perience,—the prophet sees, hears, questions, replies."—

                      p. 871. (Emphasis supplied.)

                        In what form were messages given to Zechariah? Zech. 1:
                      8-10; 4:1-7. To John the revelator? Rev. 1:10-20. See Rev. 12.

                      veyed in vision? Ezek. 8:1-12.

                         Frequently in Ellen White's experience she seemed to be
                      taken to some distant place where she saw and heard what was
                      occurring. While in Moss, Norway, in 1887, she seemed to be
                      at the Saint Helena Sanitarium in California and witnessed
                      what took place as the patients settled their accounts.
                         In Counsels on Health, pages 412, 413, she describes a
                      seeming visit to the Battle Creek Sanitarium where she saw
                      how the work was done and heard the conversation of the
                      helpers.
                         On the night of April 16, 1906, she seemed to be on an
                      eminence and viewed the great San Francisco earthquake that
                      occurred two days later. Read her vivid description in Testi-

 THINK IT THROUGH        Before one challenges the method by which God reveals
                      the light, it is wise to read the prophetic messages and ask,
                      Is this light or darkness?

                    opened to the writer of these pages. From time to time I have
                    been permitted to behold the working, in different ages, of the
                    great controversy between Christ, the Prince of life, the Author
                    of our salvation, and Satan, the prince of evil, the author of
                    sin, the first transgressor of God's holy law."—The Great Con-

                         As she wrote of her views of the second coming of Christ,
                    she declared: "Scenes of such thrilling, solemn interest passed
                    before me as no language is adequate to describe. It was all
                    a living reality to me."—Selected Messages, Bk. 1, p. 76.
                         In Testimonies, Vol. 8, pp. 41, 42, Ellen White describes the
                    view God gave to her of the final conflict between Christ and
                    Satan:
                         "In vision I saw two armies in terrible conflict. One army
                    was led by banners bearing the world's insignia; the other was
                    led by the bloodstained banner of Prince Immanuel. Standard
                    after standard was left to trail in the dust as company after
                     company from the Lord's army joined the foe and tribe after
                     tribe from the ranks of the enemy united with the command-
                     ment-keeping people of God. . . .
                         "At last the victory was gained. The army following the
                     banner with the inscription, 'The commandments of God, and
                     the faith of Jesus,' was gloriously triumphant. The soldiers of
                     Christ were close beside the gates of the city, and with joy
                     the city received her King. The kingdom of peace and joy and
                     everlasting righteousness was established."—Testimonies, Vol.

                       "The question is asked, How does Sister White know in

            Part 1  What command came to the youthful prophet Jeremiah re
 ORAL AND WRITTEN garding the message God would impart to him?
      TESTIMONIES   "Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speal
                     unto them all that I command thee: be not dismayed at their
                     faces, lest I confound thee before them." Jer. 1:17.
                        See also Ezek. 11:25.
                        The prophet is charged by God to deliver to the people the
                     messages which he has received. The prophet must bear a
                     careful and undiluted testimony of all that God has revealed
                     to him.
                       What was one means by which the prophets delivered the
                     prophetic message to the people? Jer. 26:2, 4 (first part). See
                     Zech. 1:3; 1 Kings 11:29-40.
                       Through the spoken word the prophet conveyed the mes-
                     sage of the Lord in a discourse before a company of people
                     and also in personal testimony by private interviews.
                       What were prophets at times bidden to do with the mes•
                     sages they received? Isa. 30:8; Jer. 36:2; Rev. 21:5.
                       Concerning her experience, Ellen White has written:
                       "Early in my public labors I was bidden by the Lord,
                     'Write, write the things that are revealed to you.' "—Ellen G.
                     White, Review and Herald, June 14, 1906.
                       How was a message often conveyed to an individual or
                     church? Col. 4:16; 2 Thess. 3:14, 17. Compare 2 Chron. 21:
                     12-15.
                         The messages entrusted to Ellen White were written out by
                     her and often conveyed by letters (often called "testimonies").
                     Literally thousands of such communications were mailed
                     from her home through the years. Of this she says:
                         "In these letters which I write, in the testimonies I bear, I
                     am presenting to you that which the Lord has presented to me."

                        Concerning the work of communicating God's love, she
                     urged: "Talk it, pray it, sing it, fill the world with the message
                     of His truth, and keep pressing on into the regions beyond.'

                      "And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou
                    write all these words at his mouth? Then Baruch answered
                    them, He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth,
                    and I wrote them with ink in the book." Jer. 36:4, 17, 18.
                        See also Rom. 16:22.
                        Baruch wrote out Jeremiah's message. It is probable that
                    some of Paul's epistles were dictated. Ellen White's procedure
                    was to write out her messages in longhand. These handwrit-
                    ten manuscripts were sometimes given to a secretary to
                    put into finished form. During her lifetime she wrote about
                    100,000 pages or 25,000,000 words. A large number of these
                    manuscripts are on file in the White Estate offices at the Gen-
                    eral Conference.
                        Ellen White described her writing in these words: "As the
                    work grew, others assisted me in the preparation of matter for
                    publication. After my husband's death, faithful helpers joined
                    me, who labored untiringly in the work of copying the testi-
                    monies and preparing articles for publication."—Selected

                    haven], said in 1933:
                        "'In all good conscience I can testify that never was I pre-
                    sumptuous enough to venture to add any ideas of my own or
                    to do other than follow with most scrupulous care the thoughts

                        "It was ever a source of regret to Mrs. White that her
                    schooling had been very brief [only three years of formal
                    education], and her knowledge of the technical rules of writ-
                    ing was therefore limited. W. C. White [her son] says he
                     clearly remembers the earlier years of her work in Battle Creek,
                     when James White, on coming home from the Review and
                     Herald office, would be asked to listen to what Mrs. White had
                     written, and to help her in preparing it technically for publica-
                     tion. Then, as she read to him, he would comment on the mat-
                     ter, rejoicing in the power of the message, and would point out
                     weaknesses in composition and faulty grammar."—Arthur L.

                 Part 3 What instructions were given to Ezekiel in connection with
     DIVINE MESSAGES his vision of the temple?
             IN HUMAN   "And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine
            LANGUAGE eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thine heart upon all
                        that I shall shew thee; for to the intent that I might shew
                        them unto thee art thou brought hither: declare all that thou
                        seest to the house of Israel." Ezek. 40:4.

                           "The man" whom Ezekiel saw •in his vision instructed the
                        prophet to set his heart upon all that God would show him
                        that he might accurately "declare" to "the house of Israel" all
                        that he saw. The revelation of truth was the Lord's. The
                        language of the prophet describing the vision was the language
                        of man.
                           Who is the source of the messages of the Bible? 2 Tim.
                        3:16 (first part).

                             "The Bible points to God as its author; yet it was written by
                        human hands; and in the varied style of its different books it
                        presents the characteristics of the several writers. The truths
                         revealed are all 'given by inspiration of God' (2 Tim. 3:16); yet
                         they are expressed in the words of men. . . .

                        human composition. But the Bible, with its God-given truths

                             Describing her own experience, Ellen White has written:
                        "Although I am as dependent upon the Spirit of the Lord in
                        writing my views as I am in receiving them, yet the words I
                        employ in describing what I have seen are my own, unless they
                        be those spoken to me by an angel, which I always enclose in
                        marks of quotation."—Selected Messages, Bk. 1, p. 37.
                             How did Ellen White at one time refer to the special aid of
                        God's Spirit as she wrote of what was shown to her? "While
                        I am writing out important matter, He is beside me helping me,
                        . . . and when I am puzzled for a fit word with which to express

           Part 4   What prompted the apostle Paul to write his first epistle to
      VALIDITY OF the church at Corinth?
       PROPHET'S     "For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren,
       MESSAGES by them which are of the house of Chloe, that there are con-
                    tentions among you." 1 Cor. 1:11.

                        "How was it with the apostle Paul? The news he received
                    through the household of Chloe concerning the condition of
                    the church at Corinth was what caused him to write his first
                    epistle to that church. Private letters had come to him stating
                    the facts as they existed, and in his answer he laid down gen-
                    eral principles which if heeded would correct the existing
                    evils. . . .
                        "Because the Lord had not given him a new revelation for
                    that special time, those who were really seeking light did not
                    cast his message aside as only a common letter. No, indeed.
                    The Lord had shown him the difficulties and dangers which
                    would arise in the churches, that when they should develop,
                    he might know just how to treat them. . . .
                        "Should he not take notice of the reports concerning their
                    state of anarchy and division? Most assuredly; and the reproof
                    he sent them was written just as much under the inspiration
                    of the Spirit of God as were any of his epistles."—Testimonies,
                    Vol. 5, pp. 65, 66.
                        Was every message from Ellen White the result of a specific
                    vision? "Some have taken the position that the warnings, cau-
                    tions, and reproofs given by the Lord through His servant, un-
                    less they come through special vision for each individual case,
                    should have no more weight than counsels and warnings from
                    other sources. . . . If, however, in response to some question,
                     statement, or appeal from churches or individuals, a testimony
                     is written presenting the light which God has given concern-
                     ing them, the fact that it has been called forth in this manner
                     in nowise detracts from its validity or importance."—Testimo-

                    "Counsels on Sabbath School Work," et cetera? Was it all by
                    direct vision in each case?

                      "I have no special wisdom in myself; I am only an instru-
                    ment in the Lord's hands to do the work He has set for me to

                     rebuked Jeroboam, king of Israel, for his idolatrous practices.
                     1 Kings 13:1-6. These testimonies of the prophets recorded in
                     the Scriptures "are written for our admonition, upon whom the
                     ends of the world are come." 1 Cor. 10:11.
                        Similarly, personal testimonies were written by Ellen G.
                     White. These have been included in the nine volumes of the
                     Testimonies. Ellen White explained that "since the warning
                     and instruction given in testimony for individual cases applied
                     with equal force to many others who had not been specially
                     pointed out in this manner, it seemed to be my duty to publish
                     the personal testimonies for the benefit of the church. . . .
                        "'In rebuking the wrongs of one, He designs to correct
                     many.' "—Testimonies, Vol. 5, pp. 658, 659.

                       What rebuke did Peter administer to a deceived believer?
                     Acts 8:18-24.

 THINK IT THROUGH       Paul said before King Agrippa "I was not disobedient unto
                     the heavenly vision." Acts 26:19. Shall we not—all of us—
                     inquire individually, Am I obedient to the instruction God
                     gives to me through the visions of His servant?

                         "I was . . . directed to bring out general principles, in
                     speaking and in writing, and at the same time specify the dan-
                     gers, errors, and sins of some individuals, that all might be
                     warned, reproved, and counseled. I saw that all should search
                     their own hearts and lives closely to see if they had not made
                     the same mistakes for which others were corrected and if
                     the warnings given for others did not apply to their own cases.
                     If so, they should feel that the counsel and reproofs were
                     given especially for them and should make as practical an
                     application of them as though they were especially addressed
                     to themselves."—Testimonies, Vol. 2, p. 687.

he Prophet Delivers God's Message          LESSON 5                  ❑ Friday
                                                                    November 1

          Part 6     Upon what divine power was the prophet dependent?
    A MESSENGER
       FROM GOD       "Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of
                   any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old
                   time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they
                   were moved by the Holy Ghost." 2 Peter 1:20, 21.


                      With what solemn words were the prophets at times en-
                   joined to be faithful in delivering God's messages? Jer. 26:2;
                   Ezek. 2:5-7.


                       When the people of God in any age walk contrary to the
                   guidance of His chosen representatives, they offend God.
                   See 1 Sam. 8:1-10.
                      Wrote Ellen White: "I saw the state of some who stood on
                   present truth, but disregarded the visions—the way God had
                   chosen to teach in some cases, those who erred from Bible
                   truth. I saw that in striking against the visions they did not
                   strike against the worm—the feeble instrument that God spake
                   through—but against the Holy Ghost. I saw it was a small
                   thing to speak against the instrument, but it was dangerous to
                   slight the words of God. I saw if they were in error and God
                   chose to show them their errors through visions, and they dis-
                   regarded the teachings of God through visions, they would be
                   left to take their own way, and run in the way of error, and
                   think they were right, until they would find it out too late."—

THINK IT THROUGH     Have you ever read anything in the Bible or in the "Testi-
                   monies" that seemed to have been written just for you? When
                   such mesages were in the nature of a reproof, did you re-
                   gard them as applicable as the gracious promises?


                       "Through His Holy Spirit the voice of God has come to us
                   continually in warning and instruction, to confirm the faith of
                   the believers in the Spirit of prophecy. . . . Time and trial
                   have not made void the instruction given, but through years of
                   suffering and self-sacrifice have established the truth of the
                   testimony given. The instruction that was given in the early
                   days of the message is to be held as safe instruction to follow
                   in these its closing days."—Selected Messages, Bk. 1, p. 41.

"Despise not prophesyings. Prove all things; hold fast
that which is good." 1 Thess. 5:20, 21.


   "Christ warned His disciples: 'Beware of false prophets, which come to you
in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. Ye shall know them
by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? Even so every
good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.'
. . . Here is a test, and all can apply it if they will. Those who really desire to
know the truth will find sufficient evidence for belief."—Testimonies, Vol. 5, pp.
671, 672. See also The Acts of the Apostles, page 263.
  In addition to the specifically designated Bible tests, there are certain marks
of divine guidance which prove helpful in examining the claims of anyone who
says he speaks for God. These tests must be applied to Ellen White as well as
any other person.
   The message of the true prophet will be (a) distinct for its high quality in
thought and utterance, (b) geared to the practical needs of the people, (c) ap-
plicable to current situations, (d) on a high spiritual plane, not childish or mixing
sublime and ridiculous things, and (e) not tempered to cater •to the favor of men.
   The testimony of the prophet will be motivated not by impressions or feelings
or impulses but by definite revelations from God. We see the physical phe-
nomena connected with the visions of Ellen White as one evidence among
other evidences.
  We now turn to the basic Bible tests, and we shall examine Ellen White's
work in the light of these tests. Remember, we do not test the Bible by Ellen G.
White's writing, but we test the writings of Ellen G. White by the Bible!

           AND GOD    "If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer
                     dreams, and giveth thee a sign or a wonder, and the sign o

                     of that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams." Deut. 13:1-3.

                        Did Ellen White's work call people to God or away fror
                     God? Her oral and written messages exalted God, His com
                     mandments, and His Word, the Bible.
                        "The law of God is the one unerring rule by which a
                     opinions, doctrines, and theories are to be tested. Says the
                     prophet: 'If they speak not according to this word, it is becaus,
                     there is no light in them.' "—The Great Controversy, page 452

resting the Claims of the Prophet        LESSON 6                       ❑ Monday
                                                                        November 4

           Part 2     What is another test of a prophet's work?
    FORECAST AND
     FULFILLMENT       "When a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord, if the
                    thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which
                    the Lord hath not spoken, but the prophet hath spoken it pre-
                    sumptuously: thou shalt not be afraid of him." Deut. 18:22.

                        The proof of a prophet's credentials lies, in part, in the ful-
                    fillment of his predictions. See 1 Sam. 9:6; Lam. 3:37.
                        Although Ellen White's work was not basically that of a
                    forecaster of future events, yet in some instances she pre-
                    dicted conditions and events whose fulfillments give evidence
                    of her prophetic gift. For example, in 1904 she wrote: "The
                    time is fast coming when the controlling power of the labor
                    unions will be very oppressive."—Country Living, page 9. In
                    1906 she wrote thus of calamities: "I am bidden to declare
                    the message that cities full of transgression, and sinful in the
                    extreme, will be destroyed by earthquakes, by fire, by flood."
                    — Evangelism, page 27.
                        In other instances the predictive nature of her statements is
                    not so evident, but she stated insights into the society of her
                    day that have become increasingly descriptive of present-day
                    society: (1) Decadence—Testimonies, Vol. 9, p. 13; (2) Anarchy
                    — Education, page 228; (3) Urban problems—Testimonies, Vol.
                    7, p. 82; (4) Youth dissipation—Temperance, page 274.

                      In applying the test of fulfilled predictions, what must be
                    taken into consideration? Jer. 18:9, 10.

                       The fulfillment of certain prophecies may be dependent on
                    the attitude of individuals or nations concerned, whether this
                    condition is stated in the prophecies or not. Certain condi-
                    tions arose, for example, in leading the children of Israel
                    promptly into the Promised Land which led the Lord to alter
                    His purpose.
                       Ellen White wrote thus to Seventh-day Adventists concern-
                    ing the conditional nature of God's promises: "The angels of
                    God in their messages to men represent time as very short.
                    Thus it has always been presented to me. It is true that time
                    has continued longer than we expected in the early days of
                    this message. Our Saviour did not appear as soon as we
                    hoped. But has the word of the Lord failed? Never! It should
                    be remembered that the promises and threatenings of God are
                    alike conditional."—Selected Messages, Bk. 1, p. 67. (Empha-

      THE HUMANITY

                     gone out into the world. Hereby know ye the Spirit of God
                     Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the
                     flesh is of God." 1 John 4:1, 2.

                         The Bible writings come to focus in the incarnate Christ
                     Ellen White's central theme in her writings was also the God-
                     Man Jesus Christ, whom she proclaims as indwelling Saviour
                     and supreme Lord.
                         In her book The Desire of Ages we see evidences of the
                     honor in which she held the Lord Jesus Christ. In another
                     book she wrote, "The crucified Messiah is the central point of
                     all Christianity."—Counsels to Teachers, pages 23, 24.
                         In the following forceful paragraph Ellen White writes of the
                     incarnate Christ:
                         "In contemplating the incarnation of Christ in humanity, we
                     stand baffled before an unfathomable mystery, that the human
                     mind cannot comprehend. The more we reflect upon it, the
                     more amazing does it appear. How wide is the contrast be-
                     tween the divinity of Christ and the helpless infant in Bethle-
                     hem's manger! How can we span the distance between the
                     mighty God and a helpless child? And yet the Creator of
                     worlds, He in whom was the fullness of the Godhead bodily,
                     was manifest in the helpless babe in the manger. Far higher
                     than any of the angels, equal with the Father in dignity and
                     glory, and yet wearing the garb of humanity! Divinity and hu-
                     manity were mysteriously combined, and man and God be-
                     came one. It is in this union that we find the hope of our
                     fallen race. Looking upon Christ in humanity, we look upon
                     God, and see in Him the brightness of His glory, the express
                     image of His person."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible

 THINK IT THROUGH      When one reads "The Desire of Ages" and "Steps to
                     Christ," with whom does he converse? Is the level of com-
                     munication between Ellen White and the reader or Jesus Christ
                     and the reader?

Testing the Claims of the Prophet       LESSON 6                  ❑ Wednesday
                                                                     November 6


             Part 4  What reasonable test should be applied to anyone profess-
 "BY THEIR FRUITS" ing to exercise the prophetic gift?

                      "Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's
                    clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. Ye shall
                    know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns,
                    or figs of thistles? Even so every good tree bringeth forth
                    good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. . . .
                    Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down,
                    and cast into the fire. Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know
                    them." Matt. 7:15-20.

                        The fruit of a prophet's work is to be found (1) in his own
                    personal life and experience, (2) in the lives of those who give
                    heed to his messages and are influenced by them, and (3) in
                    the character of the work and institutions which he' attempts to
                    establish.
                        Some of the fruit of Ellen White's life has been to open up
                    the Scriptures to the understanding of those who read her
                    books, to attract the reader to Jesus, and to advance the work
                    of God in the world by counsel that resulted in the establish-
                    ment of: (1) church organization; (2) educational work in all
                    levels; (3) medical institutions; (4) publishing houses; and (5)
                    worldwide extension of church work.
                        F. M. Wilcox, a past editor of the Review and Herald and
                    an associate of Ellen White, said in a sermon at a General
                    Conference session, June 7, 1946: "Her life and Christian ex-
                    perience conformed to the pure, simple, dignified principles of
                    the gospel of Christ. She exemplified in her own life, as does
                    every true prophet, the principles of truth she taught to others.
                    . . .
                         "The work of Mrs. White should not be judged by some
                     detail, by the turn of a phrase or sentence, or by some seem-
                     ing contradiction in her writings. It should be judged by the
                     spirit which has characterized her work through the years, by
                     the fruit it has borne in connection with the great religious
                     movement with which it was associated, and in the develop-
                     ment of which it bore a prominent part and exerted a molding
                     influence."

 THINK IT THROUGH      In what specific ways have the spirit of prophecy writings
                    influenced or affected the life of the Adventist people? My
                    own personal life? Has this influence spilled over into the
                    world about me? In what ways?

               Part 5  What invitation did Ellen White give to investigators who
             TESTING sought to examine the fruitage of her prophetic visions?
      ELLEN G. WHITE
                         "Let the Testimonies be judged by their fruits. What is the
                      spirit of their teaching? What has been the result of their influ-
                      ence? 'All who desire to do so can acquaint themselves with
                      the fruits of these visions.' . . .
                         "'God is either teaching His church, reproving their wrongs
                     and strengthening their faith, or He is not. This work is of
                      God, or it is not. God does nothing in partnership with Satan.
                     My work . . . bears the stamp of God or the stamp of the
                     enemy. There is no halfway work in the matter. The Testi-
                     monies are of the Spirit of God, or of the devil.' "—Testimonies,
                      Vol. 5, p. 671.
                         Back in 1889, when Ellen White learned that certain men at
                     the Battle Creek College were criticizing the Bible, she wrote:
                         "When men venture to criticize the Word of God, they ven-
                     ture on sacred, holy ground, and had better fear and tremble
                     and hide their wisdom as foolishness. God sets no man to
                     pronounce judgment on His Word, selecting some things as
                     inspired and discrediting others as uninspired. The testimonies
                     have been treated in the same way; but God is not in this."—
                     Selected Messages, Bk. 1, p. 23.
                         Ellen White wrote of her experience as God's messenger
                     thus:
                         "As the Lord has manifested Himself through the spirit of
                     prophecy, 'past, present, and future have passed before me. I
                     have been shown faces that I had never seen, and years after-
                     ward I knew them when I saw them. I have been aroused
                     from my sleep with a vivid sense of subjects previously pre-
                     sented to my mind; and I have written, at midnight, letters that
                     have gone across the continent and, arriving at a crisis, have
                     saved great disaster to the cause of God. This has been my
                     work for many years. A power has impelled me to reprove
                     and rebuke wrongs that I had not thought of. Is this work of
                     the last thirty-six years from above or from beneath?' "—Tes-

 THINK IT THROUGH      What is your testimony concerning the spirit of prophecy?

                        "Christ warned His disciples: . . . 'A good tree cannot
                     bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good
                     fruit.' . . . Here is a test, and all can apply it if they will.

Testing the Claims of the Prophet        LESSON 6                      ❑ Friday
                                                                      November 8


            Part 6     What warning does John sound to guard the church from
  BEWARE OF FALSE    deception?
        PROPHETS       "Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits
                     whether they are of God: because many false prophets are
                     gone out into the world." 1 John 4:1.
                        See also Matt. 7:15.
                        Four times in Matthew 24 Jesus pinpointed deception as a
                     principal sign of His second advent. "And many false prophets
                     shall rise, and shall deceive many." Matt. 24:11.
                        Ellen White in 1905 reiterated this warning through the
                     pages of our church paper: "There will be those who will claim
                     to have visions. When God gives you clear evidence that the
                     vision is from Him, you may accept it, but do not accept it on
                     any other evidence; for people are going to be led more and
                     more astray."—Selected Messages, Bk. 2, p. 72.
                       How are we to test 'those who claim divine enlightenment?
                         "There will be false dreams and false visions, which have
                     some truth, but lead away from the original faith. The Lord has
                     given men a rule by which to detect them: 'To the law and to
                     the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is
                     because there is no light in them' (Isa. 8:20). If they belittle
                     the law of God, if they pay no heed to His will as revealed in
                     the testimonies of His Spirit, they are deceivers. They are
                     controlled by impulse and impressions, which they believe to
                     be from the Holy Spirit, and consider more reliable than the
                     Inspired Word. They claim that every thought and feeling is an
                     impression of the Spirit; and when they are reasoned with out
                     of the Scriptures, they declare that they have something more
                     reliable. But while they think that they are led by the Spirit of
                     God, they are in reality following an imagination wrought upon
                     by Satan."—Selected Messages, Bk. 2, pp. 98, 99.

                         Ellen White wrote: "The track of truth lies close beside the
                     track of error, and both tracks may seem to be one to minds
                      which are not worked by the Holy Spirit, and which, therefore,
                      are not quick to discern the difference between truth and er-

  THINK IT THROUGH      Have I ever had occasion to use the "yardsticks" suggested
                     in this lesson? Have I personally applied them to the life

classifying, and defining the character of the testimo-

   "As the Lord liveth, even what my God saith, that will I speak." 2 Chron.
18:13.

   In Bible times there were those who denied the divine source of the prophetic
messages, declaring that in the testimony the prophet bore he was influenced
by certain individuals or circumstances.
   If the prophet's messages were only an expression of his own opinion or the
opinion of one close to him, then his claim to prophethood would be false. At
some point the criteria for a prophet would be applied to his work, and he
would be found wanting.
   In the early years of Ellen White's ministry a few attributed her visions to
hypnotism. See Early Writings, pages 21-23. At times in later years it was sug-
gested that she was influenced by strong church leaders about her—her hus-
band, for example, and other administrators, physicians, or educators. When
one man suggested to her that her testimony revealed that she had been mis-
informed by certain brethren, she wrote with great candor: "You think individ-
uals have prejudiced my mind. If I am in this state, I am not fitted to be en-
trusted with the work of God."—Selected Messages, Bk. 2, p. 63.
    Was Ellen White "fitted to be entrusted with the work of God"? Each student
will have to answer that question for himself. But an accurate response will
result only from careful, prayerful study. Is not this matter of such importance
that prejudice and preconceived ideas must be laid aside? Here we examine
 the integrity of the prophetic message.

               Part 1  What is Peter's evaluation of the prophetic message?
       DEPENDABILITY
                       "We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto
              OF THE ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a
     PROPHETIC WORD dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your
                      hearts." 2 Peter 1:19.
                         "Prophets . . are men who are sure, because they are
                      Spirit-taught; and they speak therefore with the note of abso-
                      lute authority."—G. Campbell Morgan, The Ministry of the
                      Word, page 84.
                         On the mount of transfiguration Peter saw a great light and
                      heard a voice from heaven. Peter refers to this experience in
                      2 Peter 1:16-18. But he says that prophecy is surer than what
                      he saw and heard on the mountain with Jesus.
                         There are also sensory miracles wrought by Satan. When
                      tested by the sure word of prophecy, these may be identified
                      as deception. Thus the sure word of prophecy becomes a test-
                      ing instrument. This is true in many instances.
                         Ellen White wrote about one principal deception, spiritual-
                      ism: "A correct understanding of 'what saith the Scriptures' in
                      regard to the state of the dead is essential for this time.
                      God's Word declares that the dead know not anything, their
                      hatred and love have alike perished. We must come to the
                      sure word of prophecy for our authority. . . . Unless we are
                      rooted and grounded in the truth, we shall be swept away by
                      Satan's delusive snares. We must cling to our Bibles. If Satan
                      can make you believe that there are things in the Word of God
                      that are not inspired, he will then be prepared to ensnare
                      your soul. We shall have no assurance, no certainty, at the
                      very time we need to know what is truth."—Evangelism, page
                      249.

 THINK IT THROUGH       Sight, sound, touch, taste? Or the "sure word of proph-
                      ecy"? What would you do if confronted personally, visibly,
                      by a person who appeared to be a departed relative?
                          "He [Satan] is, through his power and lying wonders, tear-
                      ing away the foundation of the Christian's hope and putting out
                      the sun that is to light them in the narrow way to heaven. He
                      is making the world believe that the Bible is uninspired, no
                      better than a storybook, while he holds out something to take
                      its place; namely, spiritual manifestations!"—Early Writings,
                      page 91.
                          "The people of God must be prepared to withstand these
                      spirits [impersonating the dead] with the Bible truth that the
                      dead know not anything, and that they who thus appear are the

                        See also Hag. 1:3, 7, 13.
                        The Bible prophets have declared that the word they gave
                     the people came from God. They often introduced the divine
                     communication through them by a phrase such as "the word of
                     the Lord came unto me, saying." Some of the variants of this
                     expression are listed below:
                        "Thus saith the Lord." 2 Sam. 7:8.
                        "As God hath said." 2 Cor. 6:16.
                        "And God spake." Gen. 8:15.
                        "The Holy Ghost saith." Heb. 3:7.
                        "I the Lord have said." Ezek. 21:17.
                        "The Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake." Acts 1:16.
                       What is the Word of the Lord said to be? Ps. 119:105.
                         It is Christ Himself who speaks in the Word, and He is
                     represented in the Scriptures as "the Light." John the Baptist
                     "was sent to bear witness of that Light." John 1:7, 8. Jesus
                     said, "While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may
                     be the children of light." John 12:36.
                         The Bible is also a light. When light from Christ reaches
                     the world through the prism of His Word, we see the colors of
                     the rainbow and light and beauty appear. The prophets take
                     the light of God and break it up into its rainbow parts—proph-
                     ecy, proverbs of wisdom, doctrine, admonition, counsel, re-
                     buke, reproof, correction, instruction in righteousness. But in
                     all of these the Light Himself, Jesus Christ, is revealed. See
                     John 1:4, 5, 9. "This is the word of the Lord," the prophets
                     proclaim.
 THINK IT THROUGH      "Thus saith the Lord—" Does the expression sound pontifi-
                     cal? Why does He speak to us at all—to us who are sinners?
                        "We can trace the line of the world's great teachers as far
                     back as human records extend; but the Light was before them.
                     As the moon and the stars of the solar system shine by the
                     reflected light of the sun, so, as far as their teaching is true,
                     do the world's great thinkers reflect the rays of the Sun of
                     Righteousness. Every gem of thought, every flash of the in-
                     tellect, is from the Light of the world. . . . 'He that followeth
                     Me,' said Jesus, 'shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the
                     light of life.' "—The Desire of Ages, pages 464, 465.

              Part 3    What circumstances led King Ahab of Israel to inquire of
MICAIAH, THE INVUL- the prophet Micaiah concerning a proposed military expedi-
                     tion? 2 Chron. 18:1-8.
  NERABLE PROPHET
                         "The prophet of the Lord did not prophesy good concerning
                     Ahab because there was nothing good to prophesy. He de-
                     livered messages to Ahab as they were given to him by God.
                     Ahab hated Micaiah because he hated the truth and despised
                     the Lord. Truth is truth, whether it is appreciated or not. What
                     the prophet of the Lord said, would come to pass, whether
                     Ahab desired it or not."—SDA Bible Commentary, on 2 Chron.
                     18:7.
                       How did Ahab's officer attempt to influence Micaiah in his
                     message to the king? 2 Chron. 18:12.

                       What did Micaiah resolve to do regardless of circum-
                     stances? 2 Chron. 18:13, 16, 27.

                        Micaiah, the true prophet of the Lord, who could not be in-
                     fluenced, was sent to prison. King Ahab, in spite of the fore-
                     cast of disaster, went into battle and was slain. 2 Chron. 18:
                     33, 34. Jehoshaphat barely escaped with his life. 2 Chron.
                     18:31; 19:1.
                        Suppose that the prophets of God would succumb to
                     bribes, to threats, to flattery—what would happen to the word
                     of the Lord which they were commissioned to deliver? And if
                     the word of the Lord could be polluted with men's notions and
                     theories, how could the church come to know God's will?
                        The prophet Micaiah was typical of all the true prophets.
                     He was courageous and unyielding in the conduct of the Lord's
                     business, refusing to deliver a message of "peace and safety"
                     when the Lord warned of war and calamity. See 1 Thess. 5:3.
                        Ahab heaped to himself the false prophets (teachers). He
                     had "itching ears" and wanted to hear only that which was
                     pleasant, but his obstinate self-will proved disastrous.

 THINK IT THROUGH       Has God preserved the purity of the Bible writings? What
                     of Mrs. White's messages to the church today?

                         "Many, very many, are questioning the verity and truth of
                     the Scriptures. Human reasoning and the imaginings of the
                     human heart are undermining the inspiration of the Word of
                     God, and that which should be received as granted, is sur-
                     rounded with a cloud of mysticism. Nothing stands out in clear
                     and distinct lines, upon rock bottom. This is one of the
                     marked signs of the last days."—Selected Messages, Bk. 1,

Integrity of the Prophetic Message        LESSON 7                   ❑ Wednesday
                                                                      November 13


           Part 4     As Jeremiah delivered an important prophetic message to
     ACCUSATIONS    the leaders of Judah, of what did they accuse him?
                      "Then spoke Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan
                    the son of Kareah, and all the proud men, saying unto Jere-
                    miah, Thou speakest falsely: the Lord our God hath not sent
                    thee to say, Go not into Egypt to sojourn there." Jer. 43:2.
                       Who was said to have originated the counsel Jeremiah de-
                    clared to be from the Lord? Jer. 43:3.
                        In an endeavor to dismiss God's clear instruction which did
                    not appeal to them as reasonable or safe counsel, the charge
                    was now made by the princes that Jeremiah's message had
                    actually originated with his literary assistant, Baruch, and not
                    with the Lord.
                        As Jehoiakim of old burned the recorded words of the
                    prophet Jeremiah in the "fire on the hearth," so in defiance
                    of the message some have at times destroyed the testimonies
                    of Ellen White. Of this she wrote: "The spirit of opposition to
                    reproof, that led to the persecution and imprisonment of Jere-
                    miah, exists today. Many refuse to heed repeated warnings,
                    preferring rather to listen to false teachers who flatter their
                    vanity and overlook their evil-doing."—Prophets and Kings,
                    page 437.
                        Who have been credited with writing certain Ellen White
                    messages? At times it was suggested that Mrs. White's literary
                    assistants, rather than the Lord, were responsible for certain
                    messages of counsel that were sent out.
                        " 'There are those who say, "Someone manipulates her
                    writings." I acknowledge the charge. It is One who is mighty
                    in counsel, One who presents before me the condition of
                    things.' "—Ellen G. White, Letter 52, 1906.
                        The inspired counsels were not altered as they passed from
                    the handwritten drafts to the printed page. Mrs. White had
                    no "ghost" writers.
 THINK IT THROUGH      If you were a prophet of God with a "thus saith the Lord"
                    for the people, how could you (and why would you) settle for
                    a substitute message of purely human origin? Could you
                    live with yourself while practicing such deception? And how
                    long would you expect to retain God's favor under such cir-
                    cumstances?
                       "If God's people will not study these messages that are sent
                    to them from time to time, they are guilty of rejecting light. . . .
                       "Heed the instruction; follow the light. The Lord 'has a con-
                    troversy with His people because in the past they have not
                    heeded His instruction and followed His guidance."—Ellen G.

              Part 5     What did Balak request Balaam to do, and with what re-
       GOD'S POWER     sults? Num. 22:1-7; 23:5-11.
       OVER BALAAM
                           "Balaam was once a good man and a prophet of God; but
                       he had apostatized, and had given himself up to covetousness;
                       yet he still professed to be a servant of the Most High. He was
                       not ignorant of God's work in behalf of Israel; and when the
                       messengers announced their errand, he well knew that it was
                       his duty to refuse the rewards of Balak and to dismiss the am-
                       bassadors. . . . But his pride was flattered by the words of his
                       ambassadors, 'He whom thou blessest is blessed, and he
                       whom thou cursest is cursed.' The bribe of costly gifts and
                       prospective exaltation excited his covetousness. He greedily
                       accepted the offered treasures, and then, while professing
                       strict obedience to the will of God, he tried to comply with the
                       desires of Balak."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 439.

                         What did Balaam state about the source of his message?
                       Num. 22:38.

                         On what was this explanation based? Verse 20.

                           "As he [Balaam] professed to be God's prophet, . . . all he
                       should say would be supposed to be uttered by divine author-
                       ity. Hence he was not to be permitted to speak as he chose,
                       but must deliver the message which God should give him. 'The
                       word which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do,' was the
                       divine command."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 441.

                          When the king remonstrated with Balaam for not cursing
                       Israel, what was Balaam's answer? Num. 23:12, 25, 26; 24:
                       10-13.

                          "The ingenuity of men has been exercised for ages to mea-
                       sure the Word of God by their finite minds and limited compre-
                       hension. If the Lord, the Author of the living oracles, would
                       throw back the curtain and reveal His wisdom and His glory
                       before them, they would shrink into nothingness and exclaim
                       as did Isaiah, 'I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the
                       midst of a people of unclean lips' (Isa. 6:5)."—Selected Mes-

 THINK IT THROUGH        The God of truth is in control of the processes of revelation.
                       He will not permit any perverse man to frustrate His Word or

                    Colporteur Ministry, page 125.
                       Specifically, how did God speak through His servant?
                       Articles in church papers: "I do not write one article in the
                    paper expressing merely my own ideas. They are what God
                    has opened before me in vision—the precious rays of light
                    shining from the throne."—Testimonies, Vol. 5, p. 67.
                       The letter testimonies: "You might say that this communica-
                    tion was only a letter. Yes, it was a letter, but prompted by
                    the Spirit of God,' to bring before your minds things that had
                    been shown me. In these letters which I write, in the testi-
                    monies I bear, I am presenting to you that which the Lord has
                    presented to me."—Testimonies, Vol. 5, p. 67.
                       Interviews: This morning I attended a meeting where a
                    select few were called together to consider some questions that
                    were presented to them by a letter soliciting consideration and
                    advice on these subjects. Of some of these subjects I could
                    speak, because at sundry times and in divers places many
                    things have been presented to me."—The Southern Work,
                    page 72.
                       Ellen White at one time answered the charge that she had
                    been influenced in the content of her writing. She wrote:
                        "Some are ready to inquire: Who told Sister White these
                    things? They have even put the question to me: Did anyone
                    tell you these things? I could answer them: Yes; yes, the
                    angel of God has spoken to me."—Testimonies, Vol. 3, p. 314.
                        While discussing the editorial policy of the Signs of the
                    Times, a church paper, Ellen White prefaced her counsels by
                     saying, "Permit me to express my mind, and yet not my mind,
                     but the word of the Lord."—Counsels to Writers and Editors,
                     page 112.
 THINK IT THROUGH      What are the reasons that you would give for defending
                     the integrity of Ellen White's writings?
                        "What reserve power has the Lord with which to reach
                     those who have cast aside His warnings and reproofs, and

   "These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received
the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether
those things were so." Acts 17:11.
   "The Bible contains all the principles that men need •to understand in order
to be fitted either for this life or for the life to come. And these principles may
be understood by all.  . Many of its treasures lie far beneath the surface, and
can be obtained only by diligent research and continuous effort. . . .
  "When thus searched out and brought together, they will be found to be
perfectly fitted to one another. Each Gospel is a supplement to the others, every
prophecy an explanation of another, every truth a development of some other
truth. The types of the Jewish economy are made plain by the gospel. Every
principle in the word of God has its place, every fact its bearing. And the com-
plete structure, in design and execution, bears testimony to its Author. Such a
structure no mind but that of the Infinite could conceive or faShion. . . .
   "In its wide range of style and subjects the Bible has something to interest
every mind and appeal to every heart. In its pages are found history the most.
ancient; biography the truest to life; principles of government for the control
of the state, for the regulation of the household—principles that human wisdom
has never equaled. It contains philosophy the most profound, poetry the sweetest
and the most sublime, the most impassioned and the most pathetic. Immeasur-
ably superior in value to the productions of any human author are the Bible
writings....
   "The central theme of the Bible, the theme about which every other in the
whole book clusters, is the redemption plan, the restoration in the human soul
of the image of God. From the first intimation of hope in the sentence pro-
nounced in Eden to that last glorious promise of the Revelation, 'They shall see
His face; and His name shall be in their foreheads' (Revelation 22:4), the burden
of every book and every passage of the Bible is the unfolding of this wondrous
theme,—man's uplifting,—the power of God, 'which 'giveth us the victory through
our Lord Jesus Christ.' 1 Corinthians 15:57."—Education, pages 123-126.

                         "'Inspiration' is found twice in the KJV: (1) Job 32:8, where
                     'inspiration' is literally 'breath,' and (2) 2 Ti 3:16, where the
                     phrase, 'all scripture is given by inspiration of God,' is literally,
                     'all Scripture is God-breathed.' "—SDA Bible Dictionary, page
                     504.
                         Inspiration in the prophetic sense represents the Holy
                     Spirit's action upon a human agent's mind, enabling that in-
                     dividual (1) to receive divine instruction either through visions
                     or by direct impressions and (2) to communicate the heavenly
                     messages in writing or in speech.

                       What chain of heavenly communication is described by
                     John? Rev. 1:1-3, 10, 11.

                        For what reason did the apostle Paul give thanks to God?
                     1 Thess. 2:13.

                        The supernatural influence exerted on the writers of Scrip-
                     ture by the Holy Spirit gave to their writings a certain trust-
                     worthiness that could not be found in the works of ordinary
                     authors. One evidence of its divine origin is the change pro-
                     duced in the lives of the students of Scripture.

                       What prayer did Jesus pray on behalf of His disciples? John
                     17:17.

                        The Bible's power to sanctify men—to set them apart as
                     holy men for God's service—is linked by a mysterious "power
                     line" to its supreme inspiration! How else could its vitality be
                     explained!

 THINK IT THROUGH      Can the Bible's power to change a person's life be limited to
                     the first exposure? What is the role of Scripture in continued
                     spiritual growth?

                         "The truth is constantly unfolding and presenting new fea-
                     tures to different minds. All who dig in the mines of truth, will

                     that all who claim to believe the truth now open before us, and
                     especially those who take the responsibility of teaching the
                     truth to others, should have a clearer conception themselves of

            Part 2     What word did Peter use to describe the workings of divine
 SPIRIT•MOVED MEN    inspiration?


                       "For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man:
                     but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy
                     Ghost." 2 Peter 1:21.


                        "The Spirit of God 'moved' the prophets. This is a word of
                     wonderful significance. Literally, it means to be 'borne along,'
                     'carried along,' impelled' or 'driven.' Weymouth uses 'im-
                     pelled,' and in Acts 27:15, 17 we read of the ship in which
                     the apostle Paul sailed as being 'driven' by the storm. This is
                     the same word."—W. E. Read, The Bible, the Spirit of Proph-
                     ecy, and the Church, page 17.

                       What was the Spirit's function in John's vision? Rev. 1:10.


                        John says that he "was in the Spirit," that is, the prophet
                     received the Spirit of God and was under His influence when
                     the visions of Revelation were given to him. See The Sanctified
                     Life, page 75.
                        The possession of the spirit of prophecy by a prophet was
                     dependent upon God's gift and the prophet's reception of the
                     communication by the Spirit of God. John was "in the Spirit
                     on the Lord's day." Rev. 1:10. Ellen White wrote, "I am as
                     dependent upon the Spirit of the Lord in writing my views as
                     I am in receiving them."—Selected Messages, Bk. 1, p. 37.

 THINK IT THROUGH      Are poets, preachers, teachers, and musicians inspired in
                     the same sense as a prophet?


                        "From the earliest times, prophets had been recognized as
                     teachers divinely appointed. In the highest sense the prophet
                     was one who spoke by direct inspiration, communicating to the
                     people the messages he had received from God. But the
                     name was given also to those who, though not so directly in-
                     spired, were divinely called to instruct the people in the works
                     and ways of God. For the training of such a class of teachers,
                     Samuel, by the Lord's direction, established the schools of
                     the prophets."—Education, page 46.

               Part 3   Did God communicate to Ezekiel the exact words of His
     IMPERFECTION OF message?
       HUMAN SPEECH    "And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine
                     eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thine heart upon all
                     that I shall shew thee; for to the intent that I might shew them
                     unto thee art thou brought hither: declare all that thou seest
                     to the house of Israel." Ezek. 40:4.

                        See also Ezek. 11:24, 25.
                        "It is not the words of the Bible that are inspired, but the
                     men that were inspired. Inspiration acts not on the man's
                     words or his expressions but on the man himself, who, under
                     the influence of the Holy Ghost, is imbued with thoughts. But
                     the words receive the impress of the individual mind. The
                     divine mind is diffused. The divine mind and will is combined
                     with the human mind and will; thus the utterances of the man
                     are the word of God."—Selected Messages, Bk. 1, p. 21.

                       Was the book of Revelation dictated word for word to the
                     apostle John? Rev. 1:11.

                        John's vision of Revelation might have been written in
                     language different from the original phraseology and still have
                     conveyed to the reader the inspired ideas. The prophet must
                     communicate God's message in the language at his command,
                     which in any event was not capable of doing perfect justice to
                     the representations he saw.
                         "The Bible, perfect as it is in its simplicity, does not answer
                     to the great ideas of God; for infinite ideas cannot be perfectly
                     embodied in finite vehicles of thought. Instead of the expres-
                     sions of the Bible being exaggerated, as many people suppose,
                     the strong expressions break down before the magnificence of
                     the thought, though the penman selected the most expressive
                     language."—Selected Messages, Bk. 1, p. 22.

 THINK IT THROUGH      Read the vision of Revelation 1:12-20. If you had been a
                     prophet like John, would you have described the scene in the
                     identical language that John used?

                         "I walk with trembling before God. I know not how to speak
                     or trace with pen the large subject of the atoning sacrifice. I
                     know not how to present subjects in the living power in which
                     they stand before me. I tremble for fear lest I shall belittle the
                     great plan of salvation by cheap words. I bow my soul in awe
                     and reverence before God, and say, Who is sufficient for these
                     things?"—Testimonies to Ministers, page 167.

     PREREQUISITE
                      "As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which
                    have been since the world began." Luke 1:70.

                      "That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken
                    before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us
                    the apostles of the Lord and Saviour." 2 Peter 3:2.

                        Holiness of life was essential to the prophetic office. The
                    prophet might be struggling against personal prejudice like
                    Jonah, or fall into sin like David, or sin like Moses on the
                    borders of the Promised Land, but God could and did accept
                    the confession and repentance of these men. However, He
                    could not and did not continue to accept an apostate like Ba-
                    laam, who sold his allegiance to God for money and the fa-
                    vor of the world.
                        The life record of Ellen White, while not free from frailties,
                    was distinguished for its Christlike consistency and integrity.
                    She was a Christian woman who had faith in Jesus and lived
                    by that faith. The prophets of God had themselves to be what
                    they expected the people under their labors to become. To
                    teach holiness meant to live holiness. 'Higher than the high-
                    est human thought can reach is God's ideal for His children.
                    Godliness—godlikeness—is the goal to be reached."—Educa-

                        This is in harmony with God's command, "Be ye holy; for I
                     am holy." 1 Peter 1:16.

                      What kind of people should Christians be? 1 Peter 2:9.
                    Compare Deut. 7:6.

                    hindrance to a repetition of the successes of Pentecost?

                       "True holiness is wholeness in the service of God. This is
                    the condition of true Christian living. Christ asks for an unre-

                     of Jesus. You will fall in love with the Man of Calvary. . . .
                     You may drink of the waters of salvation. . . . Then your lips

                     was the word of God. Satan demanded of Christ a miracle as a
                     sign of His divinity. But that which is greater than all miracles,
                     a firm reliance upon a 'Thus saith the Lord,' was a sign that
                     could not be controverted. So long as Christ held to this posi-

                    aroused in many minds by the theories presented as to the

                       Take Bible as it reads. "The language of the Bible should
                    be explained according to its obvious meaning, unless a sym-

                          The church should understand the place and operation of
                     "spiritual gifts." We talk much about the fruit of the Spirit,
                     little about the gifts. The gifts beautify the church and make
                     it noble in character, united in purpose, strong in witness—
                     ready for translation to heaven. In one sense the gifts of the
                     Holy Spirit are the tree from which the fruit of the Spirit
                     emerges. The labors and efforts of gifted pastors, teachers,
                     evangelists, and the spirit of prophecy operating in the ministry
                     of Ellen White have resulted in the fruitage of changed and
                     godly lives. The books Steps to Christ and The Desire of Ages
                     have borne a great witness.
                          James White wrote in his preface to Spiritual Gifts, Vol. 3, p.
                     29: "The object of the gifts, as stated by Paul, was 'for the
                     perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the
                     edifying of the body of Christ, till we all come in the unity of
                     the faith.' These were Heaven's appointed means to secure
                     the unity of the church. Christ prayed that His people might
                     be one, as He was one with His Father. Read John xv11. Paul
                     exhorted the Corinthians in the name of Christ to be perfectly
                     joined together in the same mind, and in the same judgment.
                     Read 1 Cor. i, 10; Rom. xv, 5; Phil. ii, 1, 2; 1 Pet. iii, 8; v, 5.
                     The gifts were given to secure this state of unity."

                     28, 8-10. See also Rom. 12:6-8; Eph. 4:8-16.
                         "Finally we see that the out-pouring of the Spirit, the gift of
                     prophecy and dreams and visions of the Lord, are to be suf-
                     ficiently remarkable to constitute signs of the Second Advent,
                     and that they are classed with the signs in the sun and moon;
                     with 'wonders in the heavens and in the earth.' To the sceptic
                     and worldly-wise this sentiment will probably seem heretical;
                     but when compared with Joel ii, 28-32; Acts ii, 14-22, it will
                     be seen to be truth. Heaven and earth will pass away, but
                     God's word will stand."—James White, Review and Herald,
                     April 21, 1851.

 THINK IT THROUGH       What gift of the Holy Spirit is more important than proph-
                     ecy? If the gifts of teaching and evangelism, for example,
                     have their place among the remnant people, why not the gift
                     of prophecy?

     OF THE GIFTS     "Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather
                    that ye may prophesy." 1 Cor. 14:1.

                        In Volume 1 of the Testimonies Ellen White wrote concern-
                    ing the duty of the church to prize the gifts and not to surren-
                    der their faith in them because of "disappointed ones."
                        "Some, I was shown, could receive the published visions,
                    judging of the tree by its fruits. Others are like doubting
                    Thomas; they cannot believe the published Testimonies, nor
                    receive evidence through the testimony of others; but must see
                    and have the evidence for themselves. Such must not be set
                    aside, but long patience and brotherly love should be exer-
                    cised toward them until they find their position and become
                    established for or against. If they fight against the visions,
                    . . . the church may know that they are not right. God's peo-
                    ple should not cringe and yield, and give up their liberty to
                    such disaffected ones. God has placed the gifts in the church
                    that the church may be benefited by them; and when professed
                    believers in the truth oppose these gifts, and fight against the
                    visions, souls are in danger through their influence, and it is
                     time then to labor with them, that the weak may not be led
                    astray by their influence."—Testimonies, Vol. 1, pp. 328, 329.

                      Where were spiritual gifts to be manifest? 1 Cor. 12:28.

                       For over a century General Conference sessions have voted
                    confidence in the gift of prophecy given to Ellen White.
                       The following statements, made by delegates in official ses-
                    sion of the General Conference in 1867 and 1958 are typical:
                       "Resolved, That we express our continued faith in the per-
                    petuity of Spiritual gifts during the gospel dispensation, and
                    our gratitude to God that he has intimately connected the spirit
                    of prophecy with the proclamation of the third angel's mes-
                    sage."—Review and Herald, May 28, 1867.

                     longtime editor of the Review and Herald, testified concerning

                     his snares. They have nipped in the bud, scheme after scheme
                     of fanaticism which the enemy has tried to foist into our midst.
                     They have exposed hidden iniquity, brought to light concealed

The Importance of the Spirit of Prophecy         LESSON 9         ❑ Wednesday
                                                                    November 27

             Part 4 How does the True Witness deal with the Laodicean church,
     ACTIVE AMONG and what counsel does He offer?
   THE LAODICEANS   "And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write;
                    These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the
                    beginning of the creation of God." "I counsel thee to buy of
                    me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white
                    raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of
                    thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with
                    eyesalve, that thou mayest see. As many as I love, I rebuke
                    and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent." Rev. 3:14,
                    18, 19.

                        All the benefits of Christ's atonement are offered freely to
                    the Laodiceans. To make us feel our need of Christ and His
                    gift of salvation there is a chastening process. This is accom-
                    plished by the messages of reproof and correction given to us
                    in His inspired messages.
                       Ellen White declared: "The Lord has seen fit to counsel
                    Elder [Uriah] Smith, to give him words of reproof because he
                    had erred; but is this an evidence that God has forsaken him?
                    —No. 'As many as I love I rebuke and chasten: be zealous
                    therefore, and repent' (Rev. 3:19). The Lord reproves wrongs
                    in His people, but is this an evidence that He has rejected
                    them?—No. There are errors in the church, and the Lord points
                    them out by His own ordained agencies, not always through
                    the testimonies."—Selected Messages, Bk. 2, p. 81.

                      Instead of an indication of God's rejection, of what is the
                    chastening of the Lord a certain evidence? Heb. 12:6, 7.

                      What excellent results does this chastening produce?
                    Verse 11.

 THINK IT THROUGH     What is the meaning to the church today of the message to
                    Laodicea? Before you answer—ask, Am I included?

                        "The message to the Laodiceans is applicable to Seventh-
                    day Adventists who have had great light and have not walked
                    in the light. It is those who have made great profession, but
                    have not kept in step with their Leader, that will be spewed out
                    of His mouth unless they repent."—Selected Messages, Bk. 2,
                    p. 66.
                        "The counsel of the True Witness is full of encouragement
                    and comfort. The clourches may yet obtain the gold of truth,
                    faith, and love, and be rich in heavenly treasure."—The Faith

The Importance of the Spirit of Prophecy            LESSON 9             ❑ Thursday
                                                                         November 28

              Part 5     What important Bible principle did Peter's vision of Acts 10
       APPLIES BIBLE   remind him?
         PRINCIPLES      "Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I per-
                       ceive that God is no respecter of persons." Acts 10:34.
                           Read Acts 10:1-35. See 2 Chron. 19:7.
                           The vision God gave to Peter on the housetop corrected
                        him as a Jew in his prejudicial attitude toward the Gentiles. In
                        Peter's case the problem was race prejudice—an attitude
                        condemned by the Scriptures (Deut. 10:17) and the example of
                       Jesus (Matt. 15:21-29). Yet the apostle learned the lesson
                       slowly. See Gal. 2:11-14. But the vision helped him to grasp
                        the Bible principle.
                           The visions of Ellen White correct those who err from Bible
                       principles. At the close of her first book, Christian Experience
                       and Views of Mrs. E. G. White (1851), she presented the matter
                       like this:
                           "I recommend to you, dear reader, the Word of God as the
                       rule of your faith and practice. By that Word we are to be
                       judged. God has, in that Word, promised to give visions in the
                       'last days'; not for a new rule of faith, but for the comfort of
                       His people, and to correct those who err from Bible truth. Thus
                       God dealt with Peter when He was about to send him to preach
                       to the Gentiles. (Acts 10.)"—Early Writings, page 78. (Empha-
                       sis supplied.)
                           How does Ellen White indicate the relationship of her mes-
                       sages to the Bible? "Little heed is given to the Bible, and the
                       Lord has given a lesser light to lead men and women to the
                       greater light."—Colporteur Ministry, page 125.
                           The operation of the Holy Spirit in the writings of Ellen
                       White was intended to exalt the Scripture testimony, not to
                       supersede it. The following extract from a testimony published
                       in 1876 shows this:
                           "Brother J would confuse the mind by seeking to make it
                       appear that the light God has given through the Testimonies is
                       an addition to the word of God, but in this he presents the
                       matter in a false light. God has seen fit in this manner to bring
                       the minds of His people to His word, to give them a clearer
                       understanding of it."—Testimonies, Vol. 4, p. 246.

The Importance of the Spirit of Prophecy        LESSON 9              ❑ Friday
                                                                    November 29

           Part 6     What claim did John the Baptist make?
      THE LORD'S
      MESSENGER       "And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he
                    saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered,
                    No." "He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness,
                    Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias."
                    John 1:21, 23.


                       John the Baptist made no claim to greatness. But Jesus
                    called him a prophet "and more than a prophet." Matt. 11:9.
                       What claim did Ellen White make for herself and her work?
                    "I have had no claims to make, only that / am instructed that I
                    am the Lord's messenger; that He called me in my youth to
                    be His messenger, to receive His word, and to give a clear
                    and decided message in the name of the Lord Jesus."—
                    Selected Messages, Bk. 1, p. 32.
                        Why did Ellen White refrain from claiming to be a prophet?
                    In a public address delivered Oct. 2, 1904, in Battle Creek,
                    Michigan, she stated that she did "not claim to be a proph-
                    etess."—Selected Messages, Bk. 1, p. 35. Explaining this
                    later, she wrote: "My work includes much more than this name
                    signifies. I regard myself as a messenger, entrusted by the Lord
                    with messages for His people. . . . My commission embraces
                    the work of a prophet, but it does not end there."—Page 36.
                        What work did God "especially" assign to Ellen White?
                        "The work which the Lord has laid out before me especially
                    is to urge young and old, learned and unlearned, to search the
                    Scriptures for themselves; . . . to assure all that the clear
                    knowledge of the Bible outdoes all other knowledge in making
                    man what God designed he should be."—Testimonies, Vol. 5,
                    p. 686.

 THINK IT THROUGH      Does the reading of these prophetic writings whet my appe-
                    tite for Bible study? When I read Ellen White's writings, do I
                    find myself thinking primarily of the writer's style or of God's
                    salvation; of Ellen White or of Christ; of the beauty of the
                    language or of the truth expressed?

                        "The Holy Spirit is Christ's representative, but divested of
                     the personality of humanity, and independent thereof."—The

                        "The Comforter is called 'the Spirit of truth.' His work is to
                     define and maintain the truth. He first dwells in the heart as
                     the Spirit of truth, and thus He becomes the Comforter. There
                     is comfort and peace in the truth, but no real peace or com-
                     fort can be found in falsehood. . . . Through the Scriptures the
                     Holy Spirit speaks to the mind, and impresses truth upon the
                     heart."—The Desire of Ages, page 671.

                       How long was the Spirit to abide with the church? John

                        "Christ has promised the gift of the Holy Spirit to His church,
                     and the promise belongs to us as much as to the first disciples.
                        "We should pray as earnestly for the descent of the Holy
                     Spirit as the disciples prayed on the day of Pentecost. If they
                     needed it at that time, we need it more today."—The Faith I

Christ's Church     LESSON 10                                         ❑ Monday
                                                                      December 2

          Part 2   What endowments were promised to the Christian church
  ENDOWMENTS OF through the Spirit?
      THE SPIRIT   "But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to
                    profit withal. For to one is given by the Spirit the word of
                    wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same
                    Spirit; to another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts
                    of healing by the same Spirit; to another the working of mira-
                    cles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to
                    another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation
                    of tongues. But all these worketh that one and the selfsame
                    Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will." 1 Cor.
                    12:7-11.
                       The Holy Spirit was the highest gift that Christ could solicit
                    from the Father for the benefit of His people. But the Spirit of
                    God, Himself a Gift, became a Giver of gifts. 1 Cor. 12:1, 7.
                       Uriah Smith, in the last page of his introduction to the book
                    Patriarchs and Prophets, wrote: "These gifts are said to be
                    'set in the church,' and if a gift is bestowed upon even one
                    member of the church, it may be said that that gift is 'in the
                    church: "
                       What assurance of His continuing presence did Christ give
                    to His disciples? Matt. 28:20, last part.

                       Jesus' promise, "Lo, I am with you alway," is fulfilled
                    through the presence of the Holy Spirit. The Master said of
                    His representative, the Spirit of God, "He dwelleth with you,
                    and shall be in you." John 14:17. Wrote John, "Hereby we
                    know that he [Christ] abideth in us, by the Spirit which he
                    hath given us." 1 John 3:24.
                       The Spirit of God, said Jesus, would "abide with you for
                    ever." John 14:16. The gifts of the Spirit are to be with the
                    church until the end of time—always functioning in harmony
                    with the "truth as it is in Jesus," our Lord and Leader.

 THINK IT THROUGH     The pastor, evangelist, and teacher in your local church are
                    God's gift to you. What happens when God's gifts are
                    spurned? Is prophecy a gift also?

                         "God often uses the simplest means to accomplish the great-
                     est results. It is His plan that every part of His work shall de-
                     pend on every other part, as a wheel within a wheel, all acting
                     in harmony. The humblest worker, moved by the Holy Spirit,
                     will touch invisible chords, whose vibrations will ring to the
                     ends of the earth, and make melody through eternal ages."—

             Part 3      By what symbol did Christ represent the church to John?
      THE CHURCH IN
          PROPHECY       "And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman
                      clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon
                      her head a crown of twelve stars." Rev. 12:1.

                         Read Rev. 12:2-5.
                        (1.) The woman clothed with the sun represents the true
                      church. See Jer. 6:2; Eph. 5:25.
                         (2) The "man child" who will rule the world with a rod of
                      iron is Jesus Christ. See Ps. 2:7-9.
                        (3) The great red dragon is symbolic of Satan in a primary
                      sense and, secondarily, of pagan Rome. See Rev. 12:9; The
                      Great Controversy, page 438.
                        (4) The remnant of the woman's seed stands for the last true
                      church of Christ. See Rev. 12:17.
                          Unsuccessful in his attacks upon the "man child" of the
                      woman, Satan next attacked the church. Persecution broke out
                      against the infant church in Jerusalem (Acts 8:1; 9:1, 2), later
                      over much of the pagan Romin Empire, still later throughout
                      papal Europe (for nearly 1,260 years—Rev. 12:6, 14). It was a
                      time of great trial for the faithful few who followed the truth of
                      God and rejected the quasi-Christian doctrine of the estab-
                      lished church.
                          By the end of the eighteenth century, however, the flood tide
                      of persecution ceased. The time was now ripe for the fulfill-
                      ment of the last part of the symbolic prophecy concerning the
                      tried and tested church of the last days—the remnant.

 THINK IT THROUGH       Open and painful persecution is an unknown experience to
                      most Christians today. Why? Did not Jesus suffer the cruelest
                      persecution? Is the absence of persecution a sign of God's
                      favor?

                         "The same spirit of hatred and opposition to the truth has
                      inspired the enemies of God in every age, and the same vigi-
                      lance and fidelity have been required in His servants. The
                      words of Christ to the first disciples are applicable to His fol-
                      lowers to the close of time: 'What I say unto you I say unto all,
                      Watch.' Mark 13:37."—The Great Controversy, pages 56, 57.

           Part 4  What action did Satan take against the woman and her
     THE REMNANT children?
          CHURCH   "And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to
                    make war with the remnant of her seed." Rev. 12:17 (first
                    part).
                        The noun "remnant" is from the Greek, loipoi, "remaining
                    ones," from the verb, leipo, "to leave," "to leave behind," and
                    does not here represent a few scattered believers but a group
                    led forth from mystical Babylon as a remnant was led out of
                    literal Babylon at the end of the exile. See SDA Bible Commen-
                    tary, Vol. 7, pp. 812-815.
                        The "remnant" are as much the object of Satan's attacks at
                    the close of the gospel dispensation as Christ and the apostles
                    were at the time the Christian church was established. Warfare
                    against God's people has never ceased. Rather it has intensi-
                    fied through the centuries and will soon reach its climax.
                        Speaking of the near future in the context of Revelation 12:
                    17, Ellen White wrote:
                        "The dignitaries of church and state will unite to bribe, per-
                    suade, or compel all classes to honor the Sunday. The lack of
                    divine authority will be supplied by oppressive enactments.
                    Political corruption is destroying love of justice and regard for
                     truth; and even in free America, rulers and legislators, in order
                     to secure public favor, will yield to the popular demand for a
                    law enforcing Sunday observance. Liberty of conscience, which
                     has cost so great a sacrifice, will no longer be respected. In
                     the soon-coming conflict we shall see exemplified the prophet's
                     words: 'The dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to
                     make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the com-
                     mandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.'
                    Revelation 12:17."—The Great Controversy, page 592.
                       In view of the coming destruction of the world's civiliza-
                    tion, what experience does Peter say believers should have?
                    2 Peter 3:11.

 THINK IT THROUGH      True martyrs are never self-made; they are created by the
                    circumstances of their fidelity to God and the truth.
                        "Satan hopes to involve the remnant people of God in the
                    general ruin that is coming upon the earth. As the coming of
                    Christ draws nigh, he will be more determined and decisive in
                    his efforts to overthrow them. Men and women will arise pro-
                    fessing to have some new light or some new revelation whose
                    tendency is to unsettle faith in the old landmarks. Their doc-
                    trines will not bear the test of God's word, yet souls will be de-

               Part 5     What marks of identity are provided to distinguish the
      IDENTIFICATION    remnant church?
     OF THE REMNANT
                          "And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to
                        make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the com-
                        mandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.'
                        "The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy." Rev. 12:
                        17; 19:10 (last part).

                            Most translators of these verses render it "testimony of
                        Jesus" or "to Jesus."
                            "The term [testimony of Jesus] in the original Greek is in
                        the genitive case, generally the equivalent of the English con-
                        struction with of, most commonly indicating possession. Hence
                        it can be understood as Jesus' testimony—the testimony that
                        Christ Himself bears today when He manifests Himself in a
                        special way through those who have the gift of prophecy. . . .
                            "It is not testimony to Jesus or concerning Jesus, but the
                        testimony of Him."—W. E. Read, The Bible, the Spirit of
                        Prophecy, and the Church, pages 107, 108.
                           What did the angel declare that John's brethren the proph.
                        ets possessed? Rev. 19:10; 22:9.

                          What further marks of identity does the remnant church
                        possess? Rev. 14:12.

                          The gift of prophecy is to appear in a Christian church
                        which has the "faith of Jesus" and that church keeps "the
                        commandments of God" (including the Sabbath). These two
                        characteristics—faith and obedience—identify the remnant
                        church of the prophecy.

 THINK IT THROUGH          Many a sincere person pleading with God for light and
                        truth would give a fortune to discover the true church. What
                        value has this identifying text (Rev. 12:17) to you as a
                        Seventh-day Adventist?

                           "The Lord will teach us our duty just as willingly as He will
                        teach somebody else. If we come to Him in faith, He will
                        speak His mysteries to us personally. . . . Those who decide
                        to do nothing in any line that will displease God, will know,
                        after presenting their case before Him, just what course to pur-
                        sue. And they will receive not only wisdom, but strength.
                        Power for obedience, for service, will be imparted to them, as
                        Christ has promised."—The Desire of Ages, page 668.

           Part 6      In what Christian movement of these latter days have the gift
      THE CHURCH    of prophecy and the other marks of prophetic identity been
                    observed? As students of Bible prophecy, Seventh-day Ad-
           TODAY    ventists see in the historical movement to which they belong a
                    fulfillment of the specifications of the prophecy. While other
                    born-again Christians, honest in heart, are potentially members
                    of the remnant church, we hold, without a sense of bigotry, to
                    the solemn truth that the Seventh-day Adventist movement it-
                    self represents the remnant of Revelation 12:17.
                      What message of truth has been entrusted to the remnant
                    people? Rev. 14:6-12. Compare Matt. 24:14.
                        "Christ is coming the second time, with power unto salva-
                    tion. To prepare human beings for this event, He has sent the
                    first, second, and third angels' messages. These angels repre-
                    sent those who receive the truth, and with power open the gos-
                    pel to the world."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Com-

                        The people who give this three-fold message constitute the
                    "remnant" of the long and worthy line of God's chosen people
                    who have "survived the fierce onslaughts of the dragon down
                    through history, most particularly the darkness, persecution,
                    and error of the 'time, and times, and half a time,' or 1260
                    'days' of vs 6, 14. It is God's last 'remnant' by virtue of the
                    fact that it is the appointed herald of His final appeal to the
                    world to accept the gracious gift of salvation (ch. 14:6-12)."—

                    you receive every new notion and those who claim to have
                    great light. The character of their work seems to be to accuse
                    and to tear down. Let the believers heed the voice of the
                    angel who said to the church, 'Press together.' In unity is yoyr

A Gift that Guards
       and Guides
   During the seventy years of her ministry (1845-1915) Ellen White was used
as God's instrument to bring prophetic guidance to His people, often in times
of crisis. A historical review of the guiding and guarding influences of the spirit
of prophecy in church life through the years gives clear, convincing ground
                                                                  LESSON 11

for confidence in God's leadership. This was true especially in the early days
when error and fanaticism threatened the leaders of the movement and she
wrote:
   "Those who passed over the ground step by step in the past history of our
experience, seeing the chain of truth in the prophecies, were prepared to accept
and obey every ray of light. They were praying, fasting, searching, digging for
the truth as for hidden treasures, and the Holy Spirit, we know, was teaching
and guiding us. Many theories were advanced, bearing a semblance of truth,
but so mingled with misinterpreted and misapplied scriptures, that they led to
dangerous errors. Very well do we know how every point of truth was estab-
lished, and the seal set upon it by the Holy Spirit of God. And all the time
voices were heard, 'Here is the truth,' I have the truth; follow me.' But the
warnings came, 'Go not ye after them. I have not sent them, but they ran.' (See
Jeremiah 23:21.)
    "The leadings of the Lord were marked, and most wonderful were His reve-
lations of what is truth. Point after point was established by the Lord God of
heaven. That which was truth then, is truth today."—Selected Messages, Bk. 2,
pp. 103, 104.
    Ellen White was not the leader of the advent movement as Moses was of the
Exodus movement. She did not serve in a kingly capacity as David did over Is-
rael. Her work was more like the work of Samuel, who was a teacher in Israel.
But as the Israel of old, "from Dan to Beersheba," recognized in Samuel the
work of a true prophet of God, so have Seventh-day Adventists recognized in
the work of Ellen White an instrumentality of God's Holy Spirit sent to give
guidance and spiritual aid and comfort to His people. Her messages-have been
a guarding, preserving influence.
    Many instances in Ellen White's ministry gave evidence of the special guid-
ance and guarding intervention of the Lord in connection with the beginnings
and growth of the advent movement.

      GUARDIANSHIP
                        "Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God,
                      thus he spoke, Come, and let us go to the seer: for he that is
                      now called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer." 1 Sam.
                      9:9.

                           In one of her earliest books, Spiritual Gifts, Bk. 1, Ellen
                      White described the many scenes of the great controversy
                       vision given to her at Lovett's Grove, Ohio, in the spring of
                      1858. In writing out her views she prepared a book of 219
                      pages. Over 200 times she wrote, "I was shown," "I was
                      pointed back," "I saw," "I was told," "It was presented before
                      me," et cetera. Thus she described scenes past and future as
                      an "eyewitness." Eventually the great controversy theme was
                      presented more fully in the Conflict of the Ages series.
                           The prophetic visions of Ellen White, from the earliest day
                       of the movement, provided:
                          1. Protection against danger from within the church. When,
                      in the 1850's, self-confidence, pride, and fanaticism threatened
                      the spirituality of the movement, the spirit of prophecy coun-
                      sels exposed this perilous position. See Testimonies, Vol. 1,
                      pp. 113-115; 311-323; 356, 357; 409-419.
                          2. Protection against danger from without the church. The
                      devices of the enemy were unmasked, first in exposing mes-
                      merism (or hypnotism), then much in the public eye, and in re-
                      vealing the true elements of deception in modern spiritualism,
                      which had its beginnings in 1848. See Early Writings, pages 59,
                      60; 262-266.
                          3. Guidance in the understanding of basic Christian truths.
                      The people of God were led into a fuller understanding of the
                      plan of redemption and into a clearer knowledge of the mean-
                      ing of current events and future events through the compre-
                      hensive great controversy vision of 1858. See Early Writings,
                      pages 145-295.
                           "I was shown . . . that I should devote myself to writing
                      out the important matters for volume 4 [The Great Controversy];
                      that the warning must go where the living messenger could not
                      go, and that it would call the attention of many to the impor-

            Part 2   At a conference held in the home of Otis Nichols at Dor-
    VISION OF THE chester, Massachusetts, in November, 1848, the pioneers
                   sought God for special guidance. Heaven seemed near, and
 PUBLISHING WORK to Ellen White was given a vision full of light. At first there was
                    only a tiny moving light. But it circled the globe and became
                    bigger all the time. After the vision she said to her husband:
                        "'I have a message for you. You must begin to print a lit-
                    tle paper and send it out to the people. Let it be small at first;
                    but as the people read, they will send you means with which
                    to print, and it will be a success from the first. From this
                    small beginning it was shown to me to be like streams of
                    light that went clear round the world.' "—Life Sketches, page
                    125.
                        Thus through the guiding light of prophecy Present Truth,
                    our first denominational periodical, was born. Scores of peo-
                    ple accepted the third angel's message in the months that fol-
                    lowed. This initial printing endeavor brought "good tidings"
                    and "peace" and "salvation" to those who read it. Today 50
                    publishing houses issue literature in nearly 200 languages,
                    valued at approximately $50,000,000 a year—"streams of light"
                    going "clear round the world"!
                        "One cannot dip deeply into the story of the Seventh-day
                    Adventist publishing work without knowing that here, indeed, is
                    the vanguard of the church. In Christ-centered publishing
                    houses the odor of printer's ink is transformed into the incense
                    of heaven; the rumble of presses swells into the thunder of
                    truth; the shuffle of paper makes way for the rustle of angel
                    wings."—M. Carol Hetzell, The Undaunted, Introduction.



 THINK IT THROUGH     Millions of people—literally—have joined the Seventh-day
                    Adventist church through the long years. Many were first
                    impressed by reading our literature. What influence have
                    Seventh-day Adventist books and magazines exerted upon
                    your mind and character? How will it be in the future?

              Part 3      What experiences in the New Testament church demon-
       ESTABLISHING    strated the value of church order and organization? Acts 6.
      CHURCH ORDER        See also Acts 15:6-32.

                           What a blessing clearly defined organization was to the early
                       Christian church. The "remnant church" experienced similar
                       incidents as discordant elements worked against unity. Ellen
                       White wrote of this in 1851, encouraging the development of
                       gospel order to protect the little flock of believers.
                           "I saw that this door at which the enemy comes in to per-
                       plex and trouble the flock can be shut. I inquired of the angel
                       how it could be closed. He said, 'The church must flee to
                       God's Word and become established upon gospel order, which
                       has been overlooked and neglected.' This is indispensably
                       necessary in order to bring the church into the unity of the
                       faith."—Early Writings, page 100.
                           As early as 1853 James White wrote in favor of "order and
                       strict discipline in the church of Christ." Others supported the
                       suggestion to organize in the interests of the growing church.
                       In 1861 the first local conference was organized in Michigan
                       with Joseph Bates as president. The General Conference fol-
                       lowed in 1863. Today the church is established on every con-
                       tinent and major island. If it had not been for the development
                       of organization, we could not today carry on a widespread mis-
                       sion program.

                         What experience came to the apostle Paul that led him to
                       carry the gospel to Europe? Acts 16:9, 10.

                          "Advance!" "Advance!" "Enter new territories" has been
                       the watchword among God's servants in apostolic and subse-
                       quent times. It was through a vision that Paul was led to
                       carry the gospel to Europe. Likewise our first overseas worker,
                       John N. Andrews, entered Europe in response to a prophetic
                       vision given the Lord's messenger. In a night vision, "One of
                       dignity and authority" was heard by Ellen White to speak:
                       "'The whole world,' He said, 'is God's great vineyard.' "—
                       Testimonies, Vol. 7, p. 34.

 THINK IT THROUGH        Jesus said, "Go ye into all the world, and preach the gos-
                       pel." But in the early 1870's there was nothing of the Sev-
                       enth-day Adventist Church established except in America. The
                       spirit of prophecy goaded the church into action. In 1874 we
                       began to move into mission territory. Where would we have
                       been today without this provocative testimony?

           Part 4     In the days of Hezekiah what remarkable instance of divine
        GUIDANCE    guidance and protection occurred?



                       Then "Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah the son
                    of Amoz, prayed and . . . the Lord saved Hezekiah and the
                    inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the
                    king of Assyria, and from the hand of all other, and guided
                    them on every side." 2 Chron. 32:20, 22.


                        Compare Isa. 37:1, 2, 6, 7, 33-37.
                        As Hezekiah, the God-fearing king, and the prophet Isaiah
                    sought the deliverance of Judah from threatened annihilation at
                    the hand of the boastful king of Assyria, "the Lord sent an
                    angel, which cut off all the mighty men" (2 Chron. 32:21), and
                    the king of Assyria was compelled to abandon the expedition.
                    Jerusalem was "guided . . . on every side."
                        And God has guided His remnant people "on every side"
                    through the spirit of prophecy. The following illustrations make
                    this clear:
                        1. Initial counsels on healthful living in 1863 resulted in the
                    establishment of a medical institution in 1866 at Battle Creek,
                    Michigan. Here the sick might find physical and spiritual heal-
                    ing and "learn how to take care of themselves and thus pre-
                    vent sickness."—Testimonies, Vol. 1, p. 494. This was the be-
                    ginning of a large sanitarium and hospital work which has
                    since spread over the globe.
                        2. The reorganization of the General Conference in 1901
                    occurred at a time when the work was being hampered by
                    centralization of authority. Today Seventh-day Adventists have
                     developed a structure of church organization that provides for
                     decision making in the field where the decision is needed.
                        The church was confronted with a reorganization plan along
                     non-sectarian lines and following pantheistic teaching as advo-
                     cated by one of our best known leaders. But the servant of
                     the Lord gave specific counsel against it. "Who has authority
                     to begin such a movement?" she asked. "We have our Bibles.
                     We have our experience, attested to by the miraculous working
                     of the Holy Spirit. We have a truth that admits of no compro-
                     mise. Shall we not repudiate everything that is not in harmony
                     with this truth?"—Selected Messages, Bk. 1, p. 205. See also

                                                                      December 12

             Part 5      In addition to leading the nation of Israel, what other work
     MESSAGES THAT    is Moses said to have done?
         PRESERVED      "And by a prophet the Lord brought Israel out of Egypt,
                      and by a prophet was he preserved." Hosea 12:13.

                          God miraculously delivered Israel, degraded in slavery and
                      largely in ignorance and apostasy, by the hand of Moses and
                      led them to the borders of the Promised Land.
                         "By a prophet was he preserved." To ensure the best of
                      spiritual and physical health God gave to His people just laws,
                      intended to make of them an exhibit before all the world of
                      the benefits to be derived from a cheerful adherence to right
                      principles. But time and again they rebelled, and time and
                      again the prophetic voice of Moses was heard warning them
                      of the tragedies that would follow disobedience and assuring
                      them of the favor and blessings of God if they followed the
                      divine instruction. Their preservation and survival as a nation
                      depended on this. See Ps. 106; 1 Cor. 10:1-11.
                         A review of the history of the Seventh-day Adventist Church
                      discloses how by the hand of a prophet we have been "pre-
                      served" by the divine instruction and protected from Satan's
                      many attacks.
                         Protection from fanaticism. One of the first burdens laid
                      upon the youthful Ellen Harmon in the early days was to erect
                      a wall about the church and protect it from fanatics who taught
                      extreme views such as holy flesh and instantaneous sanctifi-
                      cation.
                         In Life Sketches, pages 83-89, we read of attempts made by
                      some to set specific times for the Lord to come. These danger-
                      ous views were squarely met by Ellen White. She was shown
                      by the Lord that these dates would pass by. See also Testi-
                      monies, Vol. 1, p. 72.

THINK IT THROUGH        The church will face fanatics again, and the experiences of
                      the past will be repeated. Though extreme views will be
                      taught and practiced, the church as a whole will not be mis-
                      led. What is the source of our protection? How can we tell
                      the difference between truth and error?

                         "The principles of truth that God has revealed to us are our
                      only true foundation. They have made us what we are. The
                      lapse of time has not lessened their value. It is the constant
                      effort of the enemy to remove these truths from their setting,
                      and to put in their place spurious theories. He will bring in
                      everything that he possibly can to carry out his deceptive de-
                      signs. But the Lord will raise up men of keen perception, who
                      will give these truths their proper place in the plan of God."—

                                                                       December 13

             Part 6     What result follows the operation of spiritual gifts in the
 IN TIMES OF CRISIS   church?

                         "That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro,
                      and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight
                      of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to
                      deceive; but speaking the truth in love, may grow up into
                      him in all things, which is the head, even Christ." Eph. 4:
                      14, 15.

                          Paul pictured the church with a membership stable in all its
                      positions, not "tossed to and fro" by "every wind of doctrine"
                      introduced "by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness."
                          Five "Sabbath conferences" were held in 1848 by the early
                      Sabbath-keeping Adventists to seek out the truths of the Bible.
                          "At these conferences, . . . the several points of truth
                      were formed into one united belief. It was here that the foun-
                      dations of Seventh-day Adventist doctrine were laid. And here
                      again, God used the Spirit of prophecy to protect and lead
                      His people, through giving one or two visions at each of the
                      conferences. These visions, however, did not constitute a sub-
                      stitute for Bible study. . . .
                          "Writing shortly after the time of the Sabbath conferences,
                      Ellen White stated: 'We had to search and wait the opening of
                      truth, receiving a ray of light here and a ray there, laboring and
                       pleading for God to reveal truth to us. But now the truth is
                       plain; its rays are brought together. The blazing light of truth
                       when it is presented as it should be can be now seen and
                       brought to bear upon the heart.'—E. G. White MS 3, 1854. (Feb.
                       12, 1854.)"—Arthur L. White, Ellen G. White—Messenger to the
                       Remnant, pages 38, 39.

                        At a time of crisis in the experience of Israel, through what
                      means did the Lord bring about deliverance? 2 Chron. 20:
                      14-20. See Judges 4:1-7, 14.

 THINK IT THROUGH       What are the areas of need for guidance and protection to-
                      day? Do Ellen White's writings meet this need?

                         "Although there are• evils existing in the church, and will be
                      until the end of the world, the church in these last days is to be
                      the light of the world that is polluted and demoralized by sin.
                      The church, enfeebled and defective, needing to be reproved,
                      warned, and counseled, is the only object upon earth upon
                      which Christ bestows His supreme regard."—Testimonies to

    "The history which the great I AM
  has marked out in His word, uniting
  link after link in the prophetic chain,
  from eternity in the past to eternity in
  the future, tells us where we are today
  in the procession of the ages, and what
  may be expected in the time to come.
  All that prophecy has foretold as com-
  ing to pass, until the present time, has
  been traced on the pages of history, and
  we may be assured that all which is yet
  to come will be fulfilled in its order."

                                                                December 15-21




  "And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to
pass, ye might believe." John 14:29.


   It is God's intention that His people today shall have a clear knowledge of
certain developments to take place in the future and be able to face these
events, informed and ready for any eventuality. The coming of events, then,
rather than taking His people by surprise, would be faced intelligently and
would strengthen and confirm their faith in Christ, and, as Ellen White com-
ments, "they would say to one another: 'He told us that this would come, and
what we must do to meet it.' "—Testimonies, Vol. 9, p. 235.
   God's seers of old, with the prophetic view, peered down through the cen-
turies and saw the larger features of the events of the last days, and what they
saw they recorded for the instruction and encouragement of the whole world.
In harmony with His declared purpose, God has again spoken in our time through
the spirit of prophecy, and in so doing He has given to us in more minute detail
a picture of the events of the last days before Jesus' return. And the inspired
message confirms the word of the Bible prophets and aids in a fuller and more
complete understanding.
       An old English poet said, "If you can look into the seeds of time and tell
which seeds will grow and which will not, speak thou to me." Fulfilled prophecy
is still the basic test of divine inspiration. When the intelligent seeker for truth
observes one fulfillment of prophecy after another, he is then willing to listen to
God's voice and obey it.

                       "And at that time shall Michael stand up . . . : and there
                     shall be a time of trouble . . . : and . . . thy people shall
                     be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the

                     shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame
                     and everlasting contempt." Dan. 12:1, 2.

                        The special resurrection. "It is at midnight that God mani-
                     fests His power for the deliverance of His people. . . .
                        "There is a mighty earthquake. . . .

                     dust of the earth . . . awake, some to everlasting life, and
                     some to shame and everlasting contempt.' Daniel 12:2. All
                     who have died in the faith of the third angel's message come
                     forth from the tomb glorified, to hear God's covenant of peace
                     with those who have kept His law."—The Great Controversy,

                     pages 285, 286.
                        It is the longing desire of every Seventh-day Adventist to
                     see Jesus come in the clouds of heaven, but many have fallen
                     asleep and rest in the grave. Nevertheless, those who are
                     saved will not be denied the fulfillment of their brightest hope.
                     They will be raised from the grave in the special resurrection
                     of Daniel 12:2 and actually witness the return of Christ.

                       What do the New Testament writers foretell concerning the
                     deceptive power of satanic agencies? 2 Thess. 2:9, 10; 2 Cor.
                     11:13-15; Rev. 16:13, 14.

                        "Satan has long been preparing for his final effort to deceive
                     the world. The foundation of his work was laid by the assur-
                     ance given to Eve in Eden: 'Ye shall not surely die.' . . . Little
                     by little he has prepared the way for his masterpiece of decep-
                     tion in the development of spiritualism. He has not yet
                     reached the full accomplishment of his designs; but it will be
                     reached in the last remnant of time. . . . Except those who
                     are kept by the power of God, through faith in His word, the
                     whole world will be swept into the ranks of this delusion."—

      IN RELIGION  dict would take place in the religious world?
                      "Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall
                    not come, except there come a falling away first, and that
                    man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; who opposeth
                    and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is
                    worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God,
                    shewing himself that he is God." 2 Thess. 2:3, 4.
                        See also Rev. 13:3, 4, 8, 9, 14-18.
                        The prophecy of the great apostasy was fulfilled. However,
                    there came a diminishing of its power, called in prophecy "a
                    deadly wound." When the "wound" heals, the power of the
                    apostasy will return and surpass its former oppression.
                        "God's word has given warning of the impending danger;
                    let this be unheeded, and the Protestant world will learn what
                    the purposes of Rome really are, only when it is too late to

                    reproach and persecution."—The Great Controversy, page 581.

               Part 3  What is the root of all evil?
     IN THE ECONOMIC   "But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare
               WORLD and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men it
                     destruction and perdition. For the love of money is the root of
                     all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred frorr
                     the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.'
                     1 Tim. 6:9, 10.

                         See also 1 John 2:15-17.
                         "The Bible condemns no man for being rich, if he has
                     acquired his riches honestly. Not money, but the love at
                     money, is the root of all evil. It is God who gives men power
                     to get wealth; and in the hands of him who acts as God's
                     steward, using his means unselfishly, wealth is a blessing, both
                     to its possessor and to the world."—The Ministry of Healing.

                         Will business operations ever return to normal? "There are
                     not many, even among educators and statesmen, who compre-
                     hend the causes that underlie the present state of society. . . .
                     They are struggling in vain to place business operations on a
                     more secure basis. If men would give more heed to the teach-
                     ing of God's word, they would find a solution of the problems
                     that perplex them."—Testimonies, Vol. 9, p. 13. (Emphasis sup-
                     plied.)

                     prepare for the events of the future, which will soon come upon
                     them with blinding force. In the world gigantic monopolies will
                     be formed. Men will bind themselves together in unions that
                     will wrap them in the folds of the enemy. A few men will com-
                     bine to grasp all the means to be obtained in certain lines of
                     business. Trades unions will be formed, and those who refuse
                     to join these unions will be marked men."—Selected Messages,
                     Bk. 2, p. 142. See also Testimonies, Vol. 8, p. 42.
                         This prediction concerns business combinations to monopo-
                     lize wealth as well as trade unions. Oppression, cruelty, and
                     avarice are offensive to God whether practiced by industry or
                     labor. God's people are to be free from all involvement with
                     the selfish control of wealth and from dishonest, violent efforts
                     to acquire it.

 THINK IT THROUGH       How does personal freedom figure in the gigantic struggle
                     between capital and labor? What about the individual's right
                     to work? To accumulate wealth honestly? To observe the
                     Sabbath by choice? To refrain from violence? To choose not
                     to be organized?

            Part 4   What counsel was given to the mother of Samson before the
       IN SCIENCE birth of her child?
                      "And the angel of the Lord appeared unto the woman, and
                    said unto her, Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest not:
                    but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son." "But he said unto
                    me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and now
                    drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any unclean
                    thing: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the
                    womb to the day of his death." Judges 13:3, 7.

                        See also verses 13, 14.
                        Ellen White points to prenatal influence as the reason for
                    the dietary prohibitions laid upon the wife of Manoah.
                        "The effect of prenatal influences is by many parents looked
                    upon as a matter of little moment; but heaven does not so re-
                    gard it. The message sent by an angel of God, and twice
                    given in the most solemn manner, shows it to be deserving of
                    our most careful thought."—The Ministry of Healing, page 372.
                        Ellen White earnestly counseled through the years the im-
                    portance of the mother's influence on the unborn child. But
                    not until recently has science confirmed the reality of prenatal
                    influence.
                      What results followed the temperate dietary practices of
                    Daniel and his friends? Dan. 1:5, 8-15, 20.
                       Closely linked with the physical, mental, and moral welfare
                    of any people are their habits of eating and drinking. Of the
                    nearly two thousand pages comprising the five spirit of proph-
                    ecy books devoted to health, a large proportion is devoted to
                    diet.
                       "There are but few as yet who are aroused sufficiently to
                    understand how much their habits of diet have to do with
                    their health, their characters, their usefulness in this world,
                    and their eternal destiny."—Testimonies, Vol. 1, pp. 488, 489.

 THINK IT THROUGH      The fact that a humble woman without scientific degrees
                    could persuade thousands of people to accept revolutionary
                    concepts of diet is a miracle. The greater miracle is that the
                    ideas were not faddish but scientifically sound, resulting in
                    good health whenever applied with balance and adequate
                    instruction.

                       "The Spirit of God cannot come to our help, and assist us
                    in perfecting Christian characters, while we are indulging our
                    appetites to the injury of health, and while the pride of life

      IN PREPARATION Satan do? What did the change of raiment signify? What
                       promise was made to Joshua, the high priest? Zech. 3:1-7.
          TO MEET GOD
                          "Zechariah's vision of Joshua and the Angel applies with
                      peculiar force to the experience of God's people in the closing
                      up of the great day of atonement. The remnant church will be
                      brought into great trial and distress. Those who keep the
                      commandments of God and the faith of Jesus will feel the ire
                      of the dragon and his hosts. . . .
                          "Satan urges before God his accusations against them, de-
                      claring that they have by their sins forfeited the divine pro-
                      tection, and claiming the right to destroy them as transgres-
                      sors."—Testimonies, Vol. 5, pp. 472, 473.
                         "All that have put on the robe of Christ's righteousness will
                      stand before Him as chosen and faithful and true. Satan has
                      no power to pluck them out of the hand of Christ."—Testimo-

                        What question asked by Jesus suggests a condition that will
                      exist in earth's last days? Luke 18:8. See Matt. 24:12.

                          "I was shown the people of God, and saw them mightily
                      shaken. Some, with strong faith and agonizing cries, were
                      pleading with God. . . .
                          "Some, I saw, did not participate in this work of agonizing
                      and pleading. They seemed indifferent and careless. They
                      were not resisting the darkness around them, and it shut them
                      in like a thick cloud. . . .
                          "I asked the meaning of the shaking I had seen, and was
                      shown that it would be caused by the straight testimony called
                      forth by the counsel of the True Witness to the Laodiceans.
                      This will have its effect upon the heart of the receiver, and
                      will lead him to exalt the standard and pour forth the straight
                      truth. Some will not bear this straight testimony. They will
                      rise up against it, and this will cause a shaking among God's
                      people."—Testimonies, Vol. 1, pp. 179-181.

 THINK IT THROUGH       The solemn appeal of the True Witness to prepare to meet
                      God should stir us to respond in love.

                         "Now is the time to prepare. The seal of God will never be
                      placed upon the forehead of an impure man or woman. It will
                      never be placed upon the forehead of the ambitious, world-
                      loving man or woman. It will never be placed upon the fore-
                      head of men or women of false tongues or deceitful hearts. All
                      who receive the seal must be without spot before God—can-

           Part 6     What work will be accomplished before Christ comes?
   A WORLD WORK       "And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all
      COMPLETED     the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the
                    end come."—Matt. 24:14.
                       Compare Matt. 28:18-20.
                       In the vision of January 3, 1875, Ellen White was shown
                    many lights illuminating a world shrouded in darkness. She
                    was led in 1892 to declare: " 'The missionary work in Australia
                    and New Zealand is yet in its infancy, but the same work must
                    be accomplished in Australia, New Zealand, in Africa, India,
                    China, and the islands of the sea, as has been accomplished
                    in the home field.' "—Life Sketches, page 338.
                        In 1892 we had not yet opened our first mission station in
                    Africa. It was yet a year before colporteurs were to enter
                    India and a full decade before missionaries were dispatched to
                    China. As for the islands of the sea, we had just made the
                    smallest beginning.
                      Who will finish the work of the gospel? Romans 9:28.
                       "I saw that the quick work that God was doing on the earth
                    would soon be cut short in righteousness and that the messen-
                    gers must speed swiftly on their way to search out the scat-
                    tered flock."—Early Writings, page 50.
                       The prophetic assurance of triumph gives courage to the
                    believers. Note the following prophetic assurances:
                       (1) The Lord will bring us through triumphantly. "There is
                    no need to doubt, to be fearful that the work will not succeed.
                    God is at the head of the work. . . . Let us have faith that
                    God is going to carry the noble ship which bears the people of
                    God safely into port."—Selected Messages, Bk. 2, p. 390.
                       (2) God will continue with them even to the end. "I am
                    encouraged and blessed as I realize that the God of Israel is
                    still guiding His people, and that He will continue to be with
                    them, even to the end."—Selected Messages, Bk. 2, p. 406.
                    (From a message by Ellen White to the General Conference in
                    session, 1913.)

 THINK IT THROUGH     If God is with His church till the end, is not the church a
                    good place to remain? If all church members were like me,
                    what kind of a church would it be?

                     Christ as the Sin Bearer, Christ as the bright and morning

Confidence in the
Spirit of Prophecy
                               STEWARDSHIP

   "Whereupon, 0 king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly
vision." Acts 26:19.
    For a full quarter we have been studying the gift of prophecy in the Seventh-
 day Adventist Church. We have seen how the Lord has communicated His mes-
 sages through this agency. The questions now come to each one of us, What
is my relationship to this gift? What do the spirit of prophecy counsels mean
to me? How will I study and apply these counsels? The answer to these ques-
 tions ought not to be postponed or evaded. Denton E. Rebok in his book Believe
His Prophets, pages 315, 316, wrote:
    "I believe that the writings of Ellen G. White describe what God wants of me
and what God will do for me through His Son Jesus Christ. They are words of
beauty and of power. They present before me the pattern for the Christian life.
I accept her words as she has declared them to be, words of reproof for the
`erring,' words 'of encouragement to the meek and lowly,' words of `counsel,'
'instruction,' correction.' They are not the 'commandments of the Decalogue,'
but the wise counsel and earnest entreaties of a kind heavenly Father through
His chosen messenger.
    "I find myself in perfect agreement with the great mass of counsel given,
but like so many others I am tempted to despise and reject ONLY the testimo-
nies which reprove my darling sins, conflict with my own preconceived ideas of
theology, and disturb my self-complacency.
    "In these few, very few, items I am daily praying that God will help me to
conform completely and perfectly to His will and standard."
    This author then appeals to all of us as follows:
    "Brethren and sisters of the Advent family, let us give most careful, thought-
ful, and prayerful consideration to the topic of this study, and take our stand
with the remnant church for the message given to us as a people, and for the
messenger whom God chose to accomplish His will and purpose in and for us

as probationary time comes to an end, as history comes to its last chapter, as
Christ finishes His work for the salvation of men, and as closing events in the
great controversy bring us ever nearer to the grand consummation of all things
earthly.
   "We have every reason to rejoice as Seventh-day Adventists in the abundant
provision made by God Himself for our salvation. He loves us with a tender love.
He is kind and good and gentle. He has anticipated our every need, and has
given us the help we must have at every turn in life's way. He is ready to fit
us for His kingdom. May each and every one of us be molded and fashioned
according to His own divine pattern. He wants you and me in His presence
throughout eternity." Page 320.

                     them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments are as
                     the light that goeth forth." Hosea 6:5.

                       See also Heb. 12:5; 1 Peter 4:12, 13.

                       What purpose did the Lord have in sending prophets to
                     backslidden Judah? What was the response? 2 Chron. 24:19.

                        "In many cases the Testimonies are fully received, the sin
                     and indulgence broken off, and reformation at once com-
                     mences in harmony with the light God has given. In other in-
                     stances sinful indulgences are cherished. . . . The true reason
                     is not given. It is a lack of moral courage—a will, strength-
                     ened and controlled by the Spirit of God, to renounce hurtful
                     habits."—Testimonies, Vol. 4, p. 32. See also Testimonies,
                     Vol. 5, p. 234.

                        How does a wise man receive reproof? Prov. 9:8; 15:32.

                        Many who received personal .testimonies from Ellen White
                     accepted the reproof with gratitude. One was a minister and
                     president of a conference in North America who was reproved
                     for his public advocacy of fanatical teachings and actions.
                     Humbly he acknowledged in the General Conference session
                     of 1901 the Lord's counsel:
                        "'In the testimony [presented by Ellen White] . . . the test
                     came to me. But, brethren, I can thank God this morning that
                     my faith in the Spirit of prophecy remains unshaken. God has
                     spoken. He says I was wrong, and I answer, God is right, and
                     I am wrong. . . .
                        "'I have asked God to forgive me, and I know that He has
                     done it. As delegates and representatives of the cause of
                     God in the earth, I now ask you to forgive me my sins, and I
                     ask your prayers for strength and wisdom to walk aright in
                     the future. It is my determination, by the help of God, to join
                     glad hands with you in the kingdom of God.' "—Arthur L.
                     White, Ellen G. White—Messenger to the Remnant, page 20.

 THINK IT THROUGH       Ellen White explained to a certain member that she would
                     gladly communicate to that person words of commendation
                     but the Lord had not revealed these characteristics to her.
                     She had been shown the sins which were the stumbling blocks
                     and which must be removed if the believer was to negotiate
                     the road to heaven. What spiritual roadblocks appear before
                     you that the "Testimonies" mark out for removal?

           Part 2    "Which say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets,
       ACCEPT OR Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth
                  things, prophesy deceits." Isa. 30:10.

                      See also Ezek. 33:30-33.
                       "There are some in these last days who will cry: 'Speak
                    unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits.' But this is not my
                    work. God has set me as a reprover of His people; and just
                    so surely as He has laid upon me the heavy burden, He will
                    make those to whom this message is given responsible for the
                    manner in which they treat it."—Testimonies, Vol. 4, pp. 231,
                    232.
                      What was Ahab's attitude toward the true prophet of God?
                    1 Kings 22:8.
                       To what may an attitude of resistance lead? Acts 7:52, 59.
                        — It is Satan's plan to weaken the faith of God's people in
                    the Testimonies.' Satan knows how to make his attacks. He
                    works upon minds to excite jealousy and dissatisfaction toward
                    those at the head of the work. The gifts are next questioned;
                    then, of course, they have but little weight, and instruction
                    given through vision is disregarded.' 'Next follows skepticism
                    in regard to the vital points of our faith, the pillars of our posi-
                    tion, then doubt as to the Holy Scriptures, and then the down-
                    ward march to perdition. When the Testimonies, which were
                    once believed, are doubted and given up, Satan knows the
                    deceived ones will not stop at this; and he redoubles his ef-
                    forts till he launches them into open rebellion, which becomes
                    incurable and ends in destruction.' "—Testimonies, Vol. 5, p.
                    672.
                       What was David's attitude toward the message that came
                    to him from the prophet Nathan? 2 Sam. 12:7-9, 13, 14.

                       At a general gathering of workers in Europe in 1885, Ellen
                    White's interpreter was D. T. Bourdeau, a leading minister. He
                    wrote for the Review and Herald of Nov. 10, 1885, as follows:
                       "Not only does this gift reprove sin without dissimulation
                    and partiality, as did Nathan when he said to David, 'Thou art
                    the man;' but it deals in words of encouragement to help those
                    reproved to overcome, and to inspire hope, faith, and courage
                    to the desponding. It not only probes the wound, but it also
                    pours in the oil, binds the wound, and hastens the process of
                    restoration. It brings the receiver to the Bible."

 THINK IT THROUGH     Study Elder Bourdeau's comment carefully and note how
                    much can be tabulated as assets in the prophetic ledger. For
                    every word of warning in the spirit of prophecy there are ten
                    words of hope and promise!
                                                                                    105

             Part 3   As Paul recounted his experience before King Agrippa,
UNDERSTANDING THE what did he declare had been his personal relationship to
                    the vision God gave him?
 INSPIRED MESSAGES
                      "Whereupon, 0 King Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto
                    the heavenly vision." Acts 26:19.
                       The apostle practiced the truth he believed. So should we
                    be obedient to what we know that has been revealed to us.
                      How does the honest seeker understand revealed truth?
                    1 Cor. 2:12, 13.
                       Just as the student is admonished to view the Bible as a
                    whole, comparing scripture with scripture, so he should gain
                    the full picture of all the prophetic counsels of Ellen White
                    available on a given point, putting statement with statement.
                    "The testimonies themselves will be the key that will explain
                    the messages given, as scripture is explained by scripture."
                    —Selected Messages, Bk. 1, p. 42.
                       The thoughts on any teaching that is controversial should
                    remain in solution and not crystalize until all the available
                    counsels on the subject are before us.
                      What need sometimes arises among those who have
                    known God's message before? .Heb. 5:12. Compare 2 Peter
                    1:1-12.
                        The Christian must progress in his knowledge of truth. He
                    should steadily advance in an understanding of Bible princi-
                    ples. It is his privilege to enjoy a growing and dynamic, not a
                    static, experience. The writings of the prophets offer basic
                    principles to guide the life toward the goal of Christian per-
                    fection.
                        When we study the spirit of prophecy, we must consider the
                    time, place, and circumstances of the giving of the Lord's
                    message. Mrs. White wrote of the publication and use of her
                    writings: 'Regarding the testimonies, nothing is ignored; noth-
                    ing is cast aside; but time and place must be considered."—
                    Selected Messages, Bk. 1, p. 57.
                        Israel was instructed that their garments should carry a
                    fringe of blue to designate them as God's people. Num. 15:38.
                    Dedication to God may be shown today in modest attire, but
                    the principle is applied in a manner different from its applica-
                    tion with Israel. Each Christian is to study prayerfully how to
                    apply principles to the specific issue at hand.

                    the writings of Ellen White may help me resolve?

                                                                   December 25


            Part 4  Against what misuses of the writings of Ellen White are we
    MISUSE OF THE warned?
      TESTIMONIES   1. Used to force an issue. 'They profess to believe the tes-
                    timony borne, and some do harm by making them an iron
                    rule for those who have had no experience in reference to
                    them."—Testimonies, Vol. 1, p. 369.
                       2. Used as proof for unbelievers. "Some have taken an
                    injudicious course; when they have talked their faith to un-
                    believers, and the proof has been asked for, they have read
                    a vision, instead of going to the Bible for proof. . . . The vi-
                    sions can have no weight with those who have never seen them
                    and know nothing of their spirit. They should not be referred
                    to in such cases."—Testimonies, Vol. 1, pp. 119, 120.
                       3. Brief excerpts used out of context. "There are those who
                    pick out from the Word of God, and also from the Testimonies,
                    detached paragraphs or sentences that may be interpreted to
                    suit their ideas, and they dwell upon these."—Selected Mes-
                    sages, Bk. 1, p. 179.
                       The prophetic writings are up-to-date. "I have been shown
                    that the principles that were given us in the early days of the
                    message are as important and should be regarded just as con-
                    scientiously today as they were then."—Testimonies, Vol. 9,
                    p. 158.
                        Messages leave a possibility of doubt. "If you refuse to be-
                    lieve until every shadow of uncertainty and every possibility of
                    doubt is removed, you will never believe. The doubt that de-
                    mands perfect knowledge will never yield to faith. Faith rests
                    upon evidence, not demonstration."—Testimonies, Vol. 5, p. 69.
                        The principles set forth in the messages are universal in
                    their application. Ellen White's messages are for the world
                     church. Consider her eleven years of service in Europe and
                     Australia and the many pages of messages dealing with the
                    international scope of the work of the church. She was not "a
                     provincial seer" but God's messenger to the international
                     church of Seventh-day Adventists.
 THINK IT THROUGH      The spirit of prophecy counsels are not outmoded or out of
                    place today. If Ellen White is "old hat," how about the Bible
                    written eighteen centuries before the "Testimonies"?
                       "Through His Holy Spirit the voice of God has come to us
                    continually in warning and instruction, to confirm the faith of
                    the believers in the Spirit of prophecy. . . . Time and trial
                    have not made void the instruction given. . . . The instruction
                    that was given in the early days of the message is to be held
                    as safe instruction to follow in these its closing days."—

            Part 5   In Paul's appeal to Agrippa, what pertinent question did
           A VITAL he ask?
         QUESTION    "King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that
                    thou believest." Acts 26:27.

                       Compare 2 Kings 17:13, 14; Luke 24:25.
                       "My brethren, beware of the evil heart of unbelief. The
                    word of God is plain and close in its restrictions; it interferes
                    with your selfish indulgence; therefore you do not obey it. . . .
                    And to justify your carnal, ease-loving course you begin to
                    doubt whether the testimonies are from God. If you would
                    obey their teachings, you would be assured of their divine ori-
                    gin."—Testimonies, Vol. 5, p. 234.

                      When there is no prophetic vision, what dire consequences
                    result? Prov. 29:18. Compare 1 Sam. 3:1.

                       The Hebrew word here translated "vision" always means
                    prophetic vision.
                       "Satan is . . . constantly pressing in the spurious—to lead
                    away from the truth. The very last deception of Satan will be
                    to make of none effect the testimony of the Spirit of God.
                    'Where there is no vision, the people perish' (Prov. 29:18).
                    Satan will work ingeniously, in different ways and through dif-
                    ferent agencies, to unsettle the confidence of God's remnant
                    people in the true testimony."—Selected Messages, Bk. 1,
                    p. 48.
                      What solemn question does Peter ask? 2 Peter 3:10, 11.

                       D. E. Rebok, for years a spiritual leader among us, writes:
                    "Thinking through this solemn instruction given by the apostle,
                    I have come to the conclusion that the warning is for me per-
                    sonally, and the appeal is to me as to what kind of person I am
                    going to be from today on. It is not my business primarily to
                    think about you and your condition—the kind of person you
                    ought to be. That is your problem. My problem is, What kind
                    of person ought I to be? If each of us will answer that question
                    for himself, I feel confident that we shall be ready for this
                    great event that is described in such graphic terms.",—Believe

 THINK IT THROUGH     The principle of love to God and love to man must prompt
                    every action if we are to avoid the pharisaical life.
                       "We are not to be as the Pharisees, bound about by set
                    rules and regulations. . . . We are to be careful not to make
                    laws like the laws of the Pharisees, or to teach for doctrines
                    the commandments of men."—Medical Ministry, page 284.

          PROMISE     "And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into
                    the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat
                    stood and said, Hear me, 0 Judah, and ye inhabitants of
                    Jerusalem; Believe in the Lord your God, so shall ye be estab-
                    lished; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper." 2 Chron.
                    20:20.
                        "Believe his prophets, and you will succeed" is the RSV
                    rendering. Here is God's formula for "success" in the Chris-
                    tian life.
                        At a time of crisis in our work, Ellen White declared: "Some
                    will yield their faith, and will deny the truth of the messages,
                    pointing to them as falsehoods.
                        "Some will hold them up to ridicule, working against the
                    light that God has been giving for years, and some who are
                    weak in the faith will thus be led astray.
                        "But others will be greatly helped by the messages. Though
                    not personally addressed, they will be corrected, and will be
                    led to shun the evils specified. . . . The Spirit of the Lord
                    will be in the instruction, and doubts existing in many minds
                    will be swept away. . . . Light will dawn upon the understand-
                    ing, and the Spirit will make an impression on minds, as Bible
                     truth is clearly and simply presented in the messages . . .
                    God has been sending His people."—Selected Messages, Bk.
                     1, pp. 41, 42.

 THINK IT THROUGH      What advantages accrue to the Christian who orders his
                    life by the Word of God and the testimonies of His Spirit?
                    What is to be gained by rejecting the counsel of the Lord? Is
                    neglect of the "Testimonies" as hazardous as their rejection?
                    Is your position on the spirit of prophecy positive and de-
                    cided? How can you use the spirit of prophecy writings to
                    lead others to Christ?
                        In a Sabbath sermon delivered at College View, Nebraska,
                    in the year 1909 Ellen White paused, surveyed the large con-
                    gregation, and exclaimed, "0 Brethren and Sisters, how many
                    of us believe with heart and soul that we have a heaven to
                    win and a hell to shun? We cannot now do just exactly what
                    we want to do."
                         The time has come for all of us to ask, "Lord, what wilt Thou
                    have me to do?" In searching our Bible and the spirit of
                     prophecy writings, we may find the answer. We can also find
                    the Saviour by whose grace and power we may enter into a
                    new life. As we prepare for Jesus' coming, let us share with
                    all whose lives we touch every day our faith in God's guidance
                     in this Seventh-day Adventist movement.
                                                                                  109

          The Blessing of Daily Study
   "Every day some portion of time should be appropri-
ated to the study of the lessons, not merely in learning to
mechanically repeat the words, while the mind does not
comprehend the meaning; but to go to the very founda-
tion, and become familiar with what is brought out in the
lesson."--"Counsels on Sabbath School Work," page 53.




                        My Pledge
   As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge
of the Scriptures, I pledge myself to the careful and
prayerful study of some portion of my Sabbath School
lesson each day of the week.
