             Thirteenth Sabbath Offering Overflow
                   June 29, 1974—FAR EASTERN DIVISION
   Five hundred years ago the wealthy and powerful rulers of Spain and Portugal
heard stories of jungle-covered islands set in warm oceans far to the east of India.
Rumor said that these islands abounded with the spices so much coveted by
wealthy society people of Europe.
   When in 1512 Ferdinand Magellan discovered the spice islands, he also planted
the seeds of Christianity. There has been a noble harvest. Missionaries of several
denominations have worked in this territory. Today we have over a quarter million
Seventh-day Adventists in the Far Eastern Division.
   All four of the projects to benefit from the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering overflow
this quarter are located in the islands discovered by Magellan.
   1. Philippine Union College, Naga View Campus, Building Expansion. With more
than 1,700 college students, this college is our largest outside the United States.
To ease congestion, the college has had to take over a former academy located in
a beautiful mountainside setting not far from the city of Naga. With its ideal sur-
roundings, this extension campus will meet many needs! A fine master plan has been
developed which will eventually provide adequate classrooms, dormitories, cafe-
teria, library, and chapel.
    2. North Sulawesi Academy, Classrooms and Faculty Homes. Located on the
northern tip of the island of Celebes, this academy has a fine record of producing
excellent workers. However, the campus was in the direct line of fighting during a
bitter revolution in the late 1950's. School had to be suspended as the buildings
were occupied by the insurgent forces. Partial rehabilitation was accomplished.
New classrooms and faculty homes are needed.
   3. Walame Academy, Classrooms and Faculty Homes. This academy is located
on Ambon, another of the spice islands visited by Magellan in 1512. The faculty
and students are looking to the Sabbath School family to assist them in providing
classrooms and faculty homes.
  4. Jungle Chapels. Simple jungle chapels are needed in areas where we have
many church members among the tribal people.
   The workers and members of the Far Eastern Division thank you for the world-
wide Sabbath School support provided for our work in the past. The needs con-
tinue to be great, and have been made ever more critical by the dollar devaluation.
Please give generously during this quarter for these four projects and for the work
around the world.

                           NEWS FROM JESUS
                            GENERAL INTRODUCTION

    Some sixty years had passed since John last saw Jesus. He was the only one
left of the twelve men chosen by Jesus to be His disciples. The last apostle had
fallen on hard times. He had been arrested, boiled in oil and miraculously delivered,
and eventually banished to the penal colony on Patmos. There, on a Sabbath day,
he saw Jesus, and Jesus spoke to him. What He told John, and also revealed by
an angel, was not merely a message to the beloved disciple, but news from the risen
Lord for the churches in the vicinity of John's home. It was the last time that word
could come from Jesus through one who had personally walked and talked with
Him. John in turn wrote the news to those who knew him. Today we read that news
in the book of Revelation.
     The news was that Jesus would assuredly conquer the powers of evil, which
had not seemed to diminish during John's long life. He unveiled the strategy of
the evil power and revealed the way in which victory would come. That news is
still news today. Evil still appears entrenched. But the passing of centuries has
 brought the collapse of evil power structures in the way that Jesus told John they
 would fall. This encourages us that the present and future entrenchments of evil
 will also fall and Jesus will be unconditionally victorious as He told John on Patmos.
     This news is not limited to the scene of international politics. The news is also
 for the individual. He can personally conquer evil and join in Christ's victory. "When
 we as a people understand what this book [of Revelation] means to us, there will
 be seen among us a great revival."—Testimonies to Ministers, page 113.
     Ellen G. White has given some pertinent counsel on the study of Revelation:
     "Many have entertained the idea that the book of Revelation is a sealed book,
 and they will not devote time and study to its mysteries. They say that they are to
 keep looking to the glories of salvation, and that the mysteries revealed to John
 on the Isle of Patmos are worthy of less consideration than these. But God does
 not so regard this book. . . .
     "It should be studied with reverential awe."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA
 Bible Commentary, Vol. 7, p. 954.
     "We are living in a time when men who are not under the teaching of the Holy
 Spirit will bring in false theories. These men . . . have ambitious projects to carry
 out. They seek to exalt themselves, and to revolutionize .. . things. God has given
 us special instruction to guard us against such ones. He bade John write in a
 book that which should take place in the closing scenes of this earth's history."
 —Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 7, p. 954.
     "This book [Revelation] demands close, prayerful study, lest it be interpreted
 according to the ideas of men, and false construction be given to the sacred
  work of the Lord, which in its symbols and figure means so much to us. There is so
 much that we positively must understand in order that we may shape our course
  of action so that we shall not receive the plagues which are coming upon the world.
     "In the Revelation the deep things of God are portrayed. Those whose hearts
 are wholly sanctified to God will be brought light to see priceless gems through
  the telescope of faith. And as they apply the truth to practice, the still deeper mys-
  teries are stamped on the soul. These thus honored are to communicate to others
  that which they have received. And as they do this, angels make the impression
  upon hearts.
     "Let none think, because they cannot explain the meaning of every symbol in
  the Revelation, that it is of no use for them to search this book with deep, earnest
                                                                                      3

longing and intense desire to know the meaning of the truths it contains. The One
who revealed these mysteries to John can and will give the diligent searcher for
truth a foretaste of heavenly things, hereafter to be realized. Rich blessings will
come to him who reads and hears the words of this prophecy, and keeps the things
which are written therein."—Ellen G. White, Letter 16, Jan. 28, 1900.
     Exciting discoveries await the diligent student of Revelation. "Satan has blinded
the minds of many so that they have been glad of any excuse for not making the
Revelation their study. But Christ through His servant John has here declared.
. . . 'Blessed is he that readeth.' "—Testimonies to Ministers, page 116.
     Determine that your personal morning and evening sacrifice will center on the
study of the book of Revelation during this quarter. Seek the truth that can spark
a revival in the church.




                    The Blessing of Daily Study
            "Every day some portion of time should be appropri-
         ated to the study of the lessons, not merely in learning to
         mechanically repeat the words, while the mind does not
         comprehend the meaning; but to go to the very founda-
         tion, and become familiar with what is brought out in the
         lesson."—"Counsels on Sabbath School Work," page 53.



                                  My Pledge
             As one who greatly desires to improve his knowledge
          of the Scriptures, I pledge myself to the careful and
          prayerful study of some portion of my Sabbath School
          lesson each day of the week.

         The Author
         Identified
                "And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he
             laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; 1
             am the first and the last." Rev. 1:17.

                How much attention you give to a personal letter that is
             delivered to your home is determined by at least two consid-
             erations: (1) Who wrote it? and (2) Did he write anything that
             you are interested in?
                The book of Revelation may be viewed as a letter'. It has
             some features of a first-century epistle. The first chapter be-
             gins with an explanation given of the two points we noted
             above about letters:
                1. Who wrote it? It may appear that John did, but the
             Author turns out to be several links removed from the reader
             in a communication chain that is invisible to people. So John
             explains the origin of his book. When the Christian discovers
             that Jesus is the Author, he should eagerly seek to see what
             message Jesus had for him in Revelation.
                2. Did He give any message that is of interest to us in
             1974? If our interests are identified with the interests of Jesus,
             then Revelation is as relevant as can be. In the very first chap-
             ter the reader sees the divine, glorified Jesus. He is con-
             fronted by the various media through which Jesus works in
             the world—His gospel, the church, and the ministry—and is
             shown that these apparently human instruments are inti-
             mately related to our glorified Lord.
                If you are looking for word from Jesus, Revelation has it,
             bright and clear.

              Part 1     Who revealed the message contained in John's book? To
          SOURCE OF    whom is it addressed?
           THE BOOK        "The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him,
                       to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to
                       pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant
                       John: who bare record of the word of God, and of the testi-
                       mony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw. Blessed
                       is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this
                       prophecy, and keep those .things which are written therein:
                       for the time is at hand." Rev. 1:1-3.
                           John, at the beginning of his book states clearly the origin
                       of its contents. He is not expressing his own ideas. The Revela-
                       tion originates with God; but John emphasizes it as Christ's
                       revelation. Jesus is the head of the channel of communication
                       by which the book of Revelation came to earth. "Jesus Christ
                       is the great trustee of divine revelation. It is through Him that
                       we have a knowledge of what we are to look for in the closing
                       scenes of this earth's history."—Ellen G. White Comments,
                       SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 7, p. 953.
                           Jesus is the one essential link in this chain of divine com-
                       munication. Without Him there would be no word from God.
                           The letter is sent to Christ's servants. All of the other steps
                       mentioned, while important, are incidental to Christ's supreme
                       purpose of reaching His people with a message.
                          By what steps was the message relayed from Jesus to His
                       servants?
                           The first part of verse 3 in the RSV reads: "Blessed is he
                       who reads aloud the words of the prophecy." The book of Reve-
                       lation was intended to be read aloud in the churches to which
                       it was addressed. Every copy had to be made by hand, and
                       thus it would not be readily available to individual members
                       as it is today.
                          What was the subject of Christ's revelation? Verse 1.
                           Revelation is a book that points to many events. Jesus
                       opened these events to the church before they took place from
                       the viewpoint of John's time. Some of the events are still future
                       for us today.
    THINK IT THROUGH      Is the book of Revelation primarily a revelation BY Jesus,
                       or ABOUT Jesus?
                          "John, the beloved disciple, was the one chosen to receive
                       this revelation. He was the last survivor of the first chosen dis-
                       ciples."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible commentary,

           Part 2      To whom was the book of Revelation originally addressed?
  THE SALUTATION       "John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be
                    unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and
                    which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before
                    his throne; and from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness,
                    and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings
                    of the earth." Rev. 1:4, 5, first part.

                       This is not the introduction to the epistles to the seven
                    churches. It is the salutation at the beginning of the whole
                    book. It was in these seven churches that Revelation was to
                    be read aloud to the congregations.
                       From what three persons does John convey greetings to the
                    churches?
                       The greeting "Grace to you and peace" was frequently used
                    in New Testament letters. It is probably "a combination of the
                    ordinary Greek salutation chairein, 'greeting!' (as in James 1:1),
                    and the Hebrew greeting shalom."—SDA Bible Commentary,
                    on Rev. 1:4. John had been in communication with heaven and
                    could bring to man from the Godhead a greeting in the form
                    used in everyday life.
                      What is the meaning of each phrase used to describe those
                    who sent greetings?
                       Jesus is here called a "faithful witness." His whole life was
                    a witness without fault. His sacrificial death was His ultimate
                    witness to the value and immutability of God's character, and
                    the offensive nature of sin. His faithful witnessing was followed
                    by resurrection from the dead. John refers to Him as the "first
                    begotten of [or from] the dead." Not first in point of time, but
                    of importance, for without Jesus' resurrection there would be
                    no one resurrected. The result of His earthly life, death, and
                    resurrection is that He is restored to His rightful position as
                    ruler of the whole world.
                        John presents Jesus at the start of this book in the setting
                    of the gospel—His victory through life, death, and resurrection.

 THINK IT THROUGH       Whitt is the significance to me of the faithful witnessing
                    of Jesus?

                        "As He went about doing good, and healing all who were
                    afflicted by Satan, He made plain to men the character of God's
                    law and the nature of His service. His life testifies that it is
                    possible for us also to obey the law of God."—The Desire of

            Part 3      For what three benefits does John ascribe praise to Jesus?
     THE DOXOLOGY         "Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in
                     his own blood, and hath made us kings and priests unto God

                     kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so,
                     Amen." Rev. 1:5-7.
                         In the preceding verses John introduced the gospel. Here
                     he praises the Saviour for what the gospel means to the be-
                     liever.
                          What event does John say every person will see? Verse 7.
                         In verse 5 John speaks of the spiritual victory of Jesus by
                     which the physical defeat of the powers of this world became
                     certain. Here John presents the actual moment of revelation
                     of the defeat of His enemies before the whole world. Other
                     events must transpire during and after the millenium before
                     Jesus' actual coronation, but at the second advent His victory
                     will be demonstrated.
                         In verse 5 John speaks of Jesus as the "ruler of the kings
                     on earth." RSV. This rulership was not clearly visible in
                     John's day, nor is it today. Earth's rulers do not recognize Jesus
                     as a ruler over them. Here in verse 7 John calls attention to
                     the moment when the rulership of Jesus will be demonstrated
                     to His foes, even those who condemned and executed Him. Not
                      only will Jesus then claim victory, as He did at the resurrection,
                      but His enemies by their wailing will admit defeat.
                         In this passage (last of verse 5 to verse 7), there is a sum-
                      mary of the content of Revelation. It deals with the kingdom of
                      the redeemed, the church, under the leadership of Jesus in the
                      context of the victory of Jesus over His foes.
 THINK IT THROUGH         For what can I praise Jesus today?
                        Here is a vivid description of reactions to Christ's coming:
                        "With awful distinctness do priests and rulers recall the
                     events of Calvary....
                        "And now there rises a cry of mortal agony. Louder than
                     the shout, 'Crucify Him, crucify Him,' which rang through the
                     streets of Jerusalem, swells the awful, despairing wail, 'He is
                     the Son of God! He is the true Messiah!' They seek to flee
                     from the presence of the King of kings. . . .
                        "Those who would have destroyed Christ and His faithful
                     people now witness the glory which rests upon them. In the
                     midst of their terror they hear the voices of the saints in joyful
                     strains exclaiming: 'Lo, this is our God. . ..' "—The Great Con-

  IDENTIFICATIONS Speaker?
                       "I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending,
                  saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come,
                  the Almighty." Rev. 1:8.
                       Alpha and Omega are the first and last letters of the Greek
                  alphabet. Thus the expression has the same meaning as the
                  English "A to Z." It conveys the idea given by the second
                  phrase of verse 8, "the beginning and the ending."
                       Here is the second time (see verse 4) that the expression
                  "which is, and which was, and which is to come," is used in
                  this chapter. Note that the time sequence in Revelation is the
                  present, the past, and the future. See verses 4, 8, 19, for ex-
                  ample. What significance do you see in this sequence?
                       This "oral signature" follows the statement of Jesus' return
                  to earth as an assurance that the Eternal and All-powerful God
                  is the One behind the statement.
                        Who is the writer, and what were his circumstances?
                  Verse 9.
                       John was exiled to Patmos, probably by Damitian in about
                  A.D. 95. Patmos is located in the Aegean Sea about 50 miles
                   from Ephesus. The island was used by the Romans for a prison
                   colony that did forced labor in the quarries.
                        Read verses 10 and 11.
                        "The Sabbath, which God had instituted in Eden, was as
                   precious to John on the lonely isle as when he was with his
                   companions in the cities and towns. The precious promises
                   that Christ had given regarding this day he repeated and
                   claimed as his own. It was the sign to him that God was his.
                   . . . On the Sabbath day the risen Saviour made His presence
                   known to John."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Com-
                  mentary, Vol. 7, p. 955.
                        The bqok of Revelation is John's report of a Sabbath-day
                   vision. The entire report was to be sent to the seven churches
                   named in verse 11. John also recorded some things that he
                   heard, and sometimes he participated in the events and re-
                   ported what he did.
 THINK IT THROUGH        John's exile was turned into a blessing. What experiences
                   in my life have turned trouble into blessing?
                         "In the experience of the apostle John under persecution,
                     there is a lesson of wonderful strength and comfort for the
                     Christian. God does not prevent the plottings of wicked men,
                     but He causes their devices to work for good to those who in
                     trial and conflict maintain their faith and loyalty."—The Acts of

             Part 5      Read Revelation 1:12-16.
        THE DIVINE       Who is the person described in this passage? Verse 18.
     EXALTED JESUS
                         The view of Jesus presented here is at least in part a sym-
                      bolic representation of Jesus, as is indicated by the sword
                      coming out of His mouth. The question here is not if Jesus
                      really looks like this, but, What is Jesus trying to communicate
                      to us about Himself by this vision?
                         John was evidently searching for the ultimate earthly com-
                      parisons to communicate the appearance of this view of Jesus,
                      because this passage contains five superlatives: (1) white as
                      wool and snow—whitest; (2) polished bronze—shiniest; (3)
                      the roar of water—loudest; (4) the brightness of the sun—
                      brightest; (5) two-edged sword—sharpest.
                        What is the meaning of this description of Jesus? See
                      Daniel 7:9, 10; 10:5, 6; Ezekiel 1:26-28.

                          "The persecution of John became a means of grace. Patmos
                      was made resplendent with the glory of a risen Saviour. John
                      had seen Christ in human form, with the marks of the nails,
                      which will ever be His glory, in His hands and His feet. Now
                      he was permitted again to behold his risen Lord, clothed with
                      as much glory as a human being could behold, and live. What
                      a Sabbath was that to the lonely exile, always precious in the
                      sight of Christ, but now more than ever exalted! Never had he
                      learned so much of Jesus. Never had he heard such exalted
                      truth."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary,
                      Vol. 7, p. 955.
                          The candlesticks mentioned in verse 12 were not the heav-
                      enly counterpart of the seven candlesticks that were an article
                      of furniture in the earthly tabernacle. A more accurate trans-
                      lation is "lampstands." These lampstands were seven separate
                      lamps, because "the son of man" walked among them.

 THINK IT THROUGH        What is my view of who Jesus is? Do I believe in Him as
                      an eternal, self-existing, member of the Godhead?

                         "The heavenly host prostrate themselves before Him, and
                      raise their song of triumph and joy. Glory encircles the King
                      of heaven, and was beheld by all the heavenly intelligences.
                      No words can describe the scene which took place as the Son
                      of God was publicly reinstated in the place of honor and glory
                      which He voluntarily left when He became a man.

            Part 6     What was John's reaction to the vision of Jesus? See also
 THE LIVING JESUS    Daniel 10:8, 9.
                        "And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he
                     laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am
                     the first and the last: I am he that liveth, and was dead; and,
                     behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys
                     of hell and of death." Rev. 1:17, 18.

                        What does the statement "I am the first and the last" teach
                     about Jesus? Verse 17. Compare Isaiah 44:6.

                         In this vision Jesus next called attention to His death and
                     resurrection. It is this combination of the divinity, death, resur-
                     rection, and continuous living of Jesus that is at the root of
                     everything that is unveiled to John in the Revelation. The gos-
                     pel is its foundation. The startling symbols in Revelation that
                     so readily stir our curiosity must be seen always in the context
                     of the gospel. These symbols never depict merely political
                     events. In every instance where political powers are introduced
                     it is the implication for the gospel that is the point of the
                     communication.
                       After Jesus declared His personal death and resurrection,
                     what did He say He had power to do? Verse 18.

                         "Satan cannot hold the dead in his grasp when the Son of
                     God bids them live."—The Desire of Ages, page 320.
                         "The divinity of Christ is the believer's assurance of eternal
                     life. . . . [John 11:25, 26 quoted.] Christ here looks forward
                     to the time of His second coming. Then the righteous dead
                     shall be raised incorruptible, and the living righteous shall be

                         Put together the interpreted features of this vision, and the
                     thrust of the vision becomes vivid. The Divine Person is Jesus.
                     The lamps are the seven churches, which in turn represent the
                     church up to the second advent. See The Acts of the Apostles,
                     page 585. The stars are angels, in the sense of messengers
                     and not of heavenly beings. They are the elders of the
                     churches. See Gospel Workers, page 13. Jesus is walking
                     among the churches of all ages and holding the elders in His
                      right hand. This vision is a visual representation of His promise
                     given as part of the gospel commission: "Lo, I am with you
                      alway, even unto the end of the world." Matt. 28:20.

           INTRODUCTION TO LETTERS FROM JESUS
                                      LESSONS 2-5

    Chapters two and three of Revelation contain letters to seven selected churches
of Asia Minor. The author of the letters is always identified as Jesus. The cities in
which these churches were located were all cities in the Roman province of Asia.
The sequence in which they are listed by John in Revelation is a circuit which a
messenger would take from Patmos. Thus these letters were originally sent to seven
literal congregations and contained messages for them. These congregations also
stood for seven historical periods of the Christian Church from the time of Jesus
to the time of the second advent. See The Acts of the Apostles, page 585.
    Near the close of each letter an appeal is included: "He that hath an ear, let
him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches." Rev. 2:7, 11, et cetera. Since
the command is to all to note the letters to the churches, it must be concluded
that there are messages in the letters which are applicable to anyone who will
listen at any time. In our study of the seven churches we will note the meaning for
the congregation, and for the historical period, but especially the meaning for be-
lievers today.
    "He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches."


                                   Form of the Letters

   It would be helpful if each one studying these lessons would read carefully sev-
eral times, chapters two and three. Thus each one would be able to see for himself
the way the letters are arranged.
   Each letter has approximately the same form. If we identify the parts of this
form, it can provide a convenient outline for the study of each letter.

     The letter usually has seven parts:
   1. Each letter begins with the instruction, "Unto [or to] the angel of the church
of [or in]             write." The only major variation from letter to letter is the
name of the city.

    2. The second feature in each letter is introduced by "these things saith
or in the RSV "the words of         " There follows an identification of the dictator
of the letter, Jesus, by symbols usually taken from chapter one. This identification
fits some special circumstance in each letter.

  3. Each letter next contains the words "I know," followed by a statement of the
knowledge Jesus has about the congregation He is writing 10.

   4. In three letters the words "against thee" come next, followed by reproof
that Jesus presents to the church. Where the words "against thee" do not appear
there is no commendation given after "I know," and the "I know" sequence con-
tains the reproof.

   5. Every church is given a command following the reproof, such as "repent," or
"hold fast." There is no special word or phrase to identify the command, but it is
recognizable by the imperative form of the verb.

14
   6. In every letter the appeal is given, "He that hath an ear, let him hear what
the Spirit saith unto the churches." In the first three letters this appeal precedes
the promise; in the last four letters the appeal is given in the final sentence.

    7. The words "He that overcometh," or in the RSV "to him who conquers,"
introduce a promise by Jesus. The promise follows the appeal in the first three
letters, and precedes the appeal in the last four letters. The promise matches some
circumstance in each epistle.
    These seven parts will be used as an outline by which to study each epistle
and will be identified by the following captions: Instruction, Identification, Knowl-
edge, Reproof, Counsel, Appeal, Promise.
    The Sabbath School Lessons for the next four weeks will be about these letters.
Before studying the material in the lesson each week, the student will find it helpful
to read the passage in Revelation that the lesson covers. In this way he will see
the unity and continuity of the passage. For convenience and clarity the statements
in each letter that correspond to the seven parts of the letter are printed in the
lesson under the appropriate heading. If the student reads only these separated
segments of the letters in the lesson, it will be difficult for him to grasp the impact
of the letter as a whole.

                                              were important in its social structure,
                                              and on one occasion unions were the
                                              cause of demonstration and riot. See
                                              Acts 19:23-41.
                                                  Ephesus was called "the Metropolis
                                              of Asia." It had a democratic assembly
                                              of its citizens. The city boasted the

           Part 1       Instruction: "Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write."
        EPHESUS I    Rev. 2:1, first part.

                         Identification: What message to the church is contained
                     in the symbolic identification of Jesus in verse one?

                        "These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his
                     right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden
                     candlesticks." Verse 1, last part.

                        Why does Jesus identify Himself in this way to the Ephesus
                     congregation? See verse 5.

                         Knowledge: What was the nature of the evil that the Eph-
                     esian Christians opposed?


                         "I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and
                     how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast
                     tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and host
                     found them liars: and host borne, and hast patience, and for
                     my name's sake hest laboured, and host not fainted." Verses
                     2, 3.

                         The works for which the Ephesians were commended by
                     Jesus were the opposition to false apostles and their teachings,
                     and the patient endurance of the conflict that their opposition
                     to these impostors caused.

 THINK IT THROUGH       How can I know with certainty which teachings are true
                     and which are false?

                        "There exist in these last days evils similar to those that
                     threatened the prosperity of the early church; and the teach-
                     ings of the apostle John on these points should be carefully
                     heeded. 'You must have charity,' is the cry heard everywhere,
                     especially from those who profess sanctification. But true
                     charity is too pure to cover an unconfessed sin. While we are
                     to love the souls for whom Christ died, we are to make no
                     compromise with evil. We are not to unite with the rebellious
                     and call this charity. God requires His people in this age of
                     the world to stand for the right as unflinchingly as did John in
                     opposition to soul-destroying errors.
                        "The apostle teaches that while we should manifest Chris-
                     tian courtesy we are authorized to deal in plain terms with sin
                     and sinners; that this is not inconsistent with true charity."—

Letters From Jesus I      LESSON 2                                      ❑ Monday
                                                                           April 8

          Part 2       Reproof: "Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, be-
      EPHESUS II    cause thou hast left thy first love." Rev. 2:4.

                        The Ephesians had worked hard for orthodoxy—correct doc-
                    trine, but somewhere along the way they lost love.
                        The zealous stand for orthodoxy and the staunch stand
                    against heretics have the inherent risk of running out of love.
                    But the two attitudes—orthodoxy and love—are compatible,
                    and the ideal is a blending of zeal for correct doctrine with
                    fervent love for God and man. The believing saint must also
                    be a loving saint.
                        The particular way that loss of love affected the Ephesians,
                    and will affect every other believer, was a lack of labor for the
                    salvation of souls.
                        "But after a time the zeal of the believers [in Ephesus], their
                    love for God and for one another, began to wane. Coldness
                    crept into the church. Differences sprang up, and the eyes of
                    many were turned from beholding Jesus as the Author and
                    Finisher of their faith. The masses that might have been con-
                    victed and converted by a faithful practice of the truth, were
                    left unwarned. Then it was that the message was addressed
                    to the Ephesian church by the True Witness. Their lack of in-
                    terest in the salvation of souls showed that they had lost their
                    first love; for none can love God with the whole heart, mind,
                    soul, and strength without loving those for whom Christ died....
                        "Is not this experience of the Ephesian church repeated in
                     the experience of the church of this generation?"—Testimo-
                    nies, Vol. 6, p. 422.
                        An important lesson from the experience of the Ephesian
                     congregation is that love cannot be replaced by some other
                     virtue. The lack of love leaves the virtue that replaces it a
                     hollow, empty thing. See 1 Corinthians 13.
 THINK IT THROUGH      What can I do in my life to perfect the blend of correct
                    belief and love to God and people?
                        "Where is the kindling of soul you once felt at the mention
                    of the name of Jesus? In the freshness of your early dedica-
                    tion, how fervent was your love for souls! how earnestly you
                    sought to represent to them the Saviour's love! The absence
                    of that love has made you cold, critical, exacting. Seek to win
                    it back, and then labor to bring souls to Christ. If you refuse to
                    do this, others who have had less light and experience and
                    fewer opportunities will come up and take your place and do
                    that which you have neglected; for the work must be done to
                    save the tempted, the tried, the perishing. Christ offers the
                    service to His church; who will accept it?"—Testimonies, Vol.

           Part 3       Counsel: What three actions did Jesus call for by Ephesian
       EPHESUS III   Christians?
                         "Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and
                     repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee
                     quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, ex-
                     cept thou repent. But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds
                     of the Nicolaitanes, which I also hate." Rev. 2:5, 6.
                        "The believers did not sense their spiritual fall. They knew
                     not that a change had taken place in their hearts, and that
                     they would have to repent because of the noncontinuance of
                     their first works. But God in His mercy called for repentance,
                     for a return to their first love and to the works that are always
                     the result of true, Christlike love."—Ellen G. White Comments,
                     SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 7, p. 957.
                       What would be the result if they did not repent? Verse 5.
                     What does this mean in human experience?
                         Jesus is present with His people for strengthening, assisting,
                     and comforting them. When they turn from Him, He is present
                     also in judgment.
                         In verse 6 the Ephesians are commended for rejecting the
                     Nicolaitan doctrine. This was the teaching that the gospel has
                     done away with law and "we are released from the necessity
                     of being doers of the Word."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA
                     Bible Commentary, Vol. 7, p. 957. It was true that the Ephe-
                     sians had ceased to be doers of the word, but they still be-
                     lieved in being doers. Opposition to the doctrine of release
                     from obedience to the law left them with a foundation belief
                     upon which to build their reformation by the grace of Jesus.
                     This was a plus in their fallen state. If they had believed the
                     Nicolaitan doctrine the call to do the first works would have
                     contradicted the belief they held.
 THINK IT THROUGH       In what ways do I need to repent?
                          "God will accept nothing less than the whole heart. Happy
                     are they who from the commencement of their religious life
                     have been true to their first love, growing in grace and the
                     knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. The sure result of their
                     intercourse and fellowship with their beloved Lord will be to
                     increase their piety, their purity, their fervor. They are receiv-
                      ing a divine education, and this is illustrated in a life of fervor,
                     of diligence and zeal....
                          "It is our work to know our special failings and sins, which
                      cause darkness and spiritual feebleness, and quenched our

Letters From Jesus I     LESSON 2                                 ❑   Wednesday
                                                                        April 10

          Part 4       Appeal: What is the significance of this appeal to hear?
      EPHESUS IV  Compare Matthew 11:15; 13:9, 43; Luke 14:35.
                       "He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith
                  unto the churches." Rev. 2:7, first part.
                      The purpose of Revelation is to communicate a message to
                  those who will listen; and the purpose of hearing is to act upon
                  the message heard. Hearing Jesus' message without acting
                  upon it is foolish; hearing and doing the message of Jesus is
                  wise. See Matthew 7:24-27. In the Old Testament the idea of
                  hearing took on a strong connotation of obedience. See 1 Sam-
                  uel 15:22.
                      "If you 'hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches,' and
                  meditate upon the instruction given to them, your ears will be
                  closed to the folly and nonsense which surround you. You will
                  neither hear and repeat these things, nor will you ever hanker
                  after them. When Christ satisfies the soul hunger, these triviali-
                  ties are to you distasteful and disgusting. You have no desire
                  to feast upon them, but choose instead the bread of heaven."
                  —Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 7,
                  p. 957.
                       Promise: "To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the
                  tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God."
                   Verse 7, last part.
                       The promise is made to those who overcome, or are vic-
                   torious. The verse does not state what this victory is; it simply
                   says "to him that overcometh." The special victory that was
                   needed in Ephesus was pointed out by Jesus in the reproof.
                   They must recapture their first love.
                        What is the promise to victorious Ephesian Christians?
                       This promise will be fulfilled in the kingdom of God. It is an
                   assurance of being where Jesus is.
                       The promise of access to the tree of life conveys (1) the
                   assurance of restoration to the believer of what was lost in
                   Eden when man sinned; (2) assurance of being in Paradise;

            Part 5      Instructions: "And unto the angel of the church in. Smyrna
         SMYRNA I    write." Rev. 2:8, first part.

                        Identification: What is the significance of the way Jesus
                     identified Himself to the Smyrna church? Verse 10.

                       "These things saith the first and the last, which was dead,
                     and is alive." Verse 8, last part.
                         Jesus is seen here both as the eternal God, and the cruci-
                     fied and risen Saviour.
                         Knowledge: What three adverse conditions were the lot
                     of the Smyrna congregation?

                        "I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou
                     art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they
                     are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan."
                     Verse 9.
                       The Smyrna believers experienced hard times. Troubles ap-
                     pear to have come from both the Romans and the Jews. Their
                     poverty was not the poverty of an ordinary workingman. The
                     Greek word used here indicates destitution.

                        What was Jesus' evaluation of their condition? Verse 9.

                        Reproof: Jesus gave no reproof to Smyrna. Trouble due to
                     one's religious faith often leads to a closer relationship to
                     God than is found among people living under more favorable
                     and pleasant conditions.

                         Counsel: What were the two counsels given to Smyrna be-
                     lievers?

                        "Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: be-
                     hold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may
                     be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou
                     faithful unto death, and. I will give thee a crown of life."
                     Verse 10.

 THINK IT THROUGH       In what ways am I prepared or, unprepared to witness in
                     a nonretaliatory spirit, without malice or bitterness?

                        We are God's witnesses. "If ever we needed to manifest
                     kindness and true courtesy, it is now. We may have to plead
                     most earnestly before legislative councils for the right to wor-
                     ship God according to the dictates of conscience. Thus in His
                     providence God has designed that the claims of His law shall
                     be brought before men in positions of highest authority. But
                     as we stand before these men, we are to show no bitterness
                     of feeling."—Selected Messages, Bk. 2, p. 375.

Letters From Jesus I      LESSON 2                                       ❑ Friday
                                                                          April 12

          Part 6       Appeal: "He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit
       SMYRNA II    saith unto the churches." Rev. 2:11, first part.

                       What can we "hear" from the Smyrna message today?

                       Promise: "He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the
                    second death." Verse 11, last part.

                       Twice a promise is stated for this church, but it is really the
                    same promise. In verse 10, in the counsel to faithfulness unto
                    death, it is the promise of life; and in verse 11 the promise is
                    escape from the second death.
                       What did it mean for the Smyrnan to overcome? Verse 10.

                        The promises of Christ are personal encouragements. His
                    authority is His own resurrection. Death is just a sleep (John
                    11:11-14) while it is the second death that is total extinction
                    (Rev. 20:14, Mal. 4:1), a death the righteous need not fear. Vic-
                    tory lies ahead, and a crown is promised, in this instance, not
                    a crown of jewels (diadems) but a laurel crown of victory
                    (stephanos).
                        The final victory is simply the culmination point of victories
                    daily achieved. "I was shown God's people waiting for some
                    change to take place—a compelling power to take hold of
                     them. But they will be disappointed, for they are wrong. They
                     must act, they must take hold of the work themselves and
                    earnestly cry to God for a true knowledge of themselves. The
                     scenes which are passing before us are of sufficient magnitude
                     to cause us to arouse."—Testimonies, Vol. 1, p. 261.
                        "Choose poverty, reproach, separation from friends or any
                     suffering rather than to defile the soul with sin. Death before
                     dishonor or the transgression of God's law should be the motto
                     of every Christian."—Testimonies, Vol. 5, p. 147.

 THINK IT THROUGH      How do I feel about the motto: Death before sin?

                       "The word is: Go forward; discharge your individual duty,
                    and leave all consequences in the hands of God. If we move
                    forward where Jesus leads the way we shall see His triumph,
                    we shall share His joy. We must share the conflicts if we wear
                    the crown of victory. Like Jesus, we must be made perfect
                    through suffering. Had Christ's life been one of ease, then
                    might we safely yield to sloth. Since His life was marked with
                    continual self-denial, suffering, and self-sacrifice, we shall
                    make no complaint if we are partakers with Him. We can walk
                    safely in the darkest path if we have the Light of the world
                    for our guide."—Testimonies, Vol. 5, p. 71.

                     even where Satan's seat is: and thou holdest fast my name,

                     Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you,
                     where Satan dwelleth." Rev. 2:13.
                        The religious life of the people of the city Pergamos was
                     so perverted that Jesus refers to it as the place where Satan
                     himself was enthroned. This designation fits the fervent em-
                     peror worship and eastern mystery religions that centered in
                     Pergamos.
                        In spite of the adverse surroundings, what was the rela-
                     tion of the Pergamos Christians to Jesus? Verse 13.
                        Reproof: What two charges did Jesus bring against the
                     Pergamos Christians?
                        "But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast
                     there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac
                     to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat
                     things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication. So
                     hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitanes,
                     which thing I hate." Verses 14, 15.
                         Note the specific nature of this reproof. The church is not
                     charged with holding these two false doctrines, but with tolerat-
                     ing those who believe them. Here is revealed the problem of
                     the Pergamos church. It is a divided church. The believers
                     have swung over to the other extreme from Ephesus. Where
                     Ephesus zealously resisted the false teachers and their doc-
                     trines and lost their love, the believers of Pergamos have tol-
                     erated those who held these false doctrines and have thus
                     divided the church. Their tolerance for wrong may have ap-
                     peared to be loving, but Jesus revealed it as contrary to the
                     Christian faith, and thus unloving.
 THINK IT THROUGH        What is the duty of the church today regarding teachers
                     of false doctrine?
                        "To hate and reprove sin, and at the same time to show
                     pity and tenderness for the sinner, is a difficult attainment. . . .
                     There is need of showing Christlike patience and love for
                     the erring one, but there is also danger of showing so great
                     toleration for his error that he will look upon himself as un-
                     deserving of reproof, and will reject it as uncalled for and
                     unjust."—The Acts of the Apostles, pages 503, 504.

          Part 2        Reproof continued: Reread Rev. 2:14, 15.
     PERGAMOS II        In Pergamos it was not a problem of braving scorn or being
                     ostracized for participating in the actions for which Jesus re-
                     proved them. It was a question of entertainment and immoral
                     sexual relations allowed by law and custom; for there one
                     could participate in these unchristian activities and remain a
                     respectable citizen.
                        Invitations to dinner might read: "'I invite you to dine with
                     me at the temple of our Lord Serapis.' Most family parties were
                     in fact organized in this way. . . . Dare the Christian com-
                     promise? Dare he give even this much approval to a religion
                     which was the reverse of all he cherished and believed? The
                     lax and false teachers said Yes. They declared it to be quite
                     unnecessary for the Christians to cut themselves off from all
                     social fellowship in this way."—William Barclay, Letters to

                         On the question of morality the attitude of compromise was

                     marriage were entirely accepted and produced no stigma
                     whatsoever.
                         While the issues are not precisely the same, there are
                      similarities here to the permissive society of today.

                       Counsel: "Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly,
                     and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth."
                     Rev. 2:16.

                        Note that the counsel to repent given here is not to the
                     heretics and sinners, but to those who have tolerated them.
                     Jesus is calling for repentance from those who, while faithfully
                     holding fast to His name, have nonetheless been lax in oppos-
                     ing wrong. Repentance includes taking up the neglected work
                     as indicated by the threat made by Jesus to come to the
                     church with a sword and Himself fight against the heretics,
                     unless you, the faithful ones, repent. The work of separating
                     the believers of false doctrine from the faithful ones would
                     be accomplished; if not by the believers, then by Jesus Himself.
                         The false teachers of the church were constantly urging the
                     members "to conform to the accepted standards of the world
                     and to stop being different. The early church was in constant
                     danger of being tainted by and relapsing into the standards of
                      the world."—William Barclay, Letters to Seven Churches, page
                     52.

           Part 3       Appeal: "He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit
      PERGAMOS III   saith unto the churches." Rev. 2:17, first part.

                        Promise: What is the significance of overcoming in the
                     Pergamos church? Rev. 2:14-16.

                        "To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden
                     manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a
                     new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that
                     receiveth it." Verse 17, last part.

                        How does the promise of the hidden manna relate to the
                     circumstances in the Pergamos church? See Revelation 2:14,
                     15; John 6:31-34.

                        The hidden manna probably has reference to the manna that
                     was placed in a vessel and kept in the ark of the covenant. The
                     believers were not promised merely a new "fall" of manna on
                     the ground, but the promise is that they will eat manna that
                     comes from the "golden pot" that was beneath the Shekinah,
                     that is, directly from the divine Presence.
                         There are three points that may be helpful in understanding
                     the meaning of the new name written on a white stone.
                        1. The names of the tribes of Israel were engraved on stones
                     that were part of the high priest's garb.
                        2. "Great significance was attached to the names given by
                     Hebrew parents to their children. Often these stood for traits
                     of character that the parent desired to see developed in the
                     child."—Prophets and Kings, page 481.
                        3. "One of the more common ancient customs was that
                     of the use of a white and a black stone by jurors to determine
                     acquittal or conviction."—SDA Bible Commentary, on Rev.
                     2:17.
                        These yield the significance of (1) permanence, (2) char-
                     acter, and (3) acquittal.

 THINK IT THROUGH      How can the Word be reasonably symbolized as both a
                     sword and manna?

                        "God has not only revealed to us the doctrine of the atone-
                     ment, holding out the hope of eternal life, but His words are
                     the manna from heaven for the soul to feed upon and receive
                     spiritual strength. The Bible is the great standard of right and
                     wrong, clearly defining sin and holiness. Its living principles,
                     running through our lives like threads of gold, are our only
                     safeguard in trial and temptation."—Counsels to Teachers,

Letters From Jesus II      LESSON 3                                ❑ Wednesday
                                                                       April 17


          Part 4       Identification: "These things saith the Son of God, who
      THYATIRA I    hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet are like
                    fine brass." Rev. 2:18, last part.

                        What is the significance of the description "eyes like unto
                    a flame of fire"? Verse 23.

                       What is the symbolic meaning of feet? Heb. 2:8. See Rev.
                    2:27.
                       Knowledge: What were the works of Thyatira?

                        "I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and
                    thy patience, and thy works; and the last to be more than the
                    first." Rev. 2:19.
                        This is the only church where Jesus notes an improvement
                    in the believers' works. In this regard it is the opposite of the
                    message to Ephesus where they were called upon to do the
                    first works.
                       Reproof: Rev. 2:20-23.
                       The teachings of Jezebel are the same as the teachings of
                    Balaam (compare verses 14 and 20).
                       "The manner of punishment to be meted out to the false
                    prophetess will be appropriate to her crime. This expression
                    seems to be of Semitic origin, and is used with respect to fall-
                    ing ill. . . . Compare the English expression 'to take to one's
                    bed.' "—SDA Bible Commentary, on Rev. 2:22.
                       The problems in Thyatira were the same problems that ex-
                    isted in Pergamos, but intensified. The division in the church
                    was deep. Jesus addressed the three preceding churches as
                    a unit. The message to Thyatira contains two messages—one
                    for each faction of the church. See verse 24.

 THINK IT THROUGH      How can I improve my work of faith and love and put
                    them in the proper place in my Christian experience?

                       "The value of our work is in proportion to the impartation
                    of the Holy Spirit. Trust in God brings holier qualities of mind,
                    so that in patience we may possess our souls.
                       "The yoke is placed upon the oxen to aid them in drawing
                    the load, to lighten the burden. So with the yoke of Christ.
                    When our will is swallowed up in the will of God, and we use
                    His gifts to bless others, we shall find life's burden light. He
                    who walks in the way of God's commandments is walking in
                    company with Christ, and in His love the heart is at rest"—

Letters From Jesus II        LESSON 3                                  ❑ Thursday
                                                                            April 18

            Part 5      Reproof continued: What is the charge against Jezebel?
        THYATIRA II   Rev. 2:21.

                         Eating food sacrificed to idols gave the appearance of
                      loyalty to the deity to whom the sacrifice had been offered.
                      Sexual immorality by any person was a relationship with an-
                      other that was condemned by God. For the married person it
                      was also a relationship contrary to the Christian marriage vows.
                      In both instances, with God and the spouse, the believers had
                      committed themselves to loyalty and fidelity. Jezebel taught
                      that these virtues were dispensable and undesirable. What
                      lessons for today are there in the indictment of Jezebel?
                         "The fornication of this Jezebel was habitual and of long
                      standing, for she had children. Figuratively, this should prob-
                      ably be understood in the sense that she had won committed
                      adherents. Judgment was to descend not only upon the mother
                      but also upon the offspring, who were contaminated by her
                      evil character. Compare the destruction of the children of Ahab
                      (2 Kings 10:7)."—SDA Bible Commentary, on Rev. 2:23.
                         Counsel: "But to the rest of you in Thyatira, who do not
                      hold this teaching, who have not learned what some call the
                      deep things of Satan, to you I say, I do not lay upon you any
                      other burden; only hold fast what you have, until I come."
                      Rev. 2:24, 25, RSV.

                          The phrase "deep things of Satan" points to Gnosticism as
                      the heresy propagated by Jezebel and her followers. The
                      Gnostics claimed to know the "deep things." Jesus identifies
                      the source of these "deep things" by adding "of Satan."
                          The Thyatrians were to hold on to what they had. What did
                      they have? They had an improving and growing experience
                      (see verse 19). Their current works were better than those
                      in the past. They were moving forward under extremely difficult
                      circumstances. Jesus asks of every person his best service,
                      and he will be judged in the light of the opportunities to ren-
                      der it.

 THINK IT THROUGH         In what ways am I failing to grow in my Christian expe-
                      rience?

                         "God designs that Christians shall grow continually, grow
                      up unto the full stature of men and women in Christ. All who
                      do not grow stronger, and become more firmly rooted and
                      grounded in the truth, are continually retrograding."—Testimo-

     THYATIRA III   come?

                       "And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the
                    end, to him will I give power over the nations: and he shall
                    rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall
                    they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.
                    And I will give him the morning star." Rev. 2:26-28.

                        The overcomers will develop the opposition to sin that the
                    believers of Thyatira had neglected. They are pictured here
                    as breaking sinners like earthen pots.
                        "The tables will turn, and the saints who have been perse-
                    cuted pilgrims and strangers in this rebel world will inherit and
                    rule over the earth as was God's purpose in the beginning when
                    He gave the ,dominion to Adam. The royal power and authority
                    of Christ will be shared with His victorious saints, who con-
                    stitute His bride and queen....
                        "The new order of things must be preceded by the breaking
                    up of the old. The Master Potter breaks the old so He can
                    reconstruct the new. Christ breaks in pieces all the wicked
                    nations so that He might restore the dominion of Adam and
                    the kingdom of David with Himself as the King of kings and

                    in Thyatira? Verse 20.

                      What is the meaning of the "morning star"? 2 Peter 1:19;

 THINK IT THROUGH      In what ways am I "soft" on sin?

                       "His [Christ's] power awaits the demand of those who
                    would overcome. The reprover is to animate his hearers so
                    that they shall strive for the mastery. He is to encourage them
                    to struggle for deliverance from every sinful practice, to be
                    free from every corrupt habit, even if his denial of self is like
                    taking the right eye, or separating the right arm from the body.

            Part 1      Instructions: "And unto the angel of the church in Sardis
          SARDIS I   write." Rev. 3:1, first part.

                        Identification: What are the meanings of the two symbols
                     by which Jesus identified Himself in the Sardis letter? See
                     Revelation 1:4, 20.
                       "These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God,
                     and the seven stars." Rev. 3:1, second part.
                       Knowledge: What did Jesus call attention to about their
                     works?
                       "I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest,
                     and art dead." Verse 1, last part.
                         The church in Sardis lived on its reputation, but this no
                     longer accorded with reality. This church was the opposite of
                     Smyrna. Jesus lodged no reproof against Smyrna, and no com-
                     mendation for Sardis. Everything was against Sardis. What
                     virtue does death hold? and Sardis was dead.
                         What caused their death? In the identification Jesus hinted
                     at the reasons. Jesus had the Spirit and the messengers. These
                     they needed. Their religion had no living content. All religion
                     dies without the Spirit and the human communicator. The reli-
                     gion of Sardis had become a form without the Spirit or the
                     message. Only the shell remained.
                         "With God outward show weighs nothing. The outward forms
                     of religion, without the love of God in the soul, are utterly
                     worthless."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commen-

                         "No amount of past experience will suffice for the present
                     nor strengthen us to overcome the difficulties in our path. We
                     must have new grace and fresh strength daily in order to be
                     victorious."—Testimonies, Vol. 3, p. 541.
                         "When the Saviour pointed out to His followers the signs
                     of His return, He foretold the state of backsliding that would
                     exist just prior to His second advent. . . .
                         "The condition of the church at this time is pointed out in
                     the Saviour's words in the Revelation: 'Thou hast a name that
                     thou livest, and art dead.' "—The Great Controversy, pages

                     and yet, unless Christ is woven into all that he says and does,

                                                                            April 22

          Part 2       Counsel: What five counsels did Jesus give to the Sardis
        SARDIS II   church?

                       "Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain,
                    that are ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect
                    before God. Remember therefore how thou hast received and
                    heard, and hold fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not
                    watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know
                    what hour I will come upon thee." Rev. 3:2, 3.

                        Sardis Christians were dead, but not hopeless. The "seven
                    Spirits" and one of the seven angels Jesus would send for
                    their spiritual resurrection. The counsel to watch points to
                    the reason for their spiritual death. They fell asleep, and sleep
                    became death.
                        "Those who have been born again remember with what joy
                    and gladness they received the light of heaven, and how eager
                    they were to tell everybody of their happiness. . . .
                        "'Hold fast.' This does not mean, Hold fast to your sins;
                    but, Hold fast to the comfort, the faith, the hope, that God has
                    given you in His Word. Never be discouraged. . . .
                        "We are to 'hold fast' and live up to all the light we receive
                    from heaven. Why? Because God wants us to grasp the eternal
                    truth, and act as His helping hand by communicating the light
                    to those who are not acquainted with His love for them. . . .
                        "'And repent.' The life we live is to be one of continual re-
                    pentance and humility. We need to repent constantly, that we
                    may be constantly victorious. When we have true humility, we
                    have victory. The enemy never can take out of the hand of
                    Christ the one who is simply trusting in His promises. If the
                    soul is trusting and working obediently, the mind is susceptible
                     to divine impressions, and the light of God shines in, enlighten-
                    ing the understanding. What privileges we have in Christ
                    Jesus!"—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary,
                    Vol. 7, p. 959.

 THINK IT THROUGH      What is my level of watchfulness?

                        "I have a message from God to the sinners in Zion, the ones
                    whom Christ addressed: 'Be watchful, and strengthen the things
                    which remain, that are ready to die: for I have not found thy
                    works perfect before God.' You need to offer always the sacred
                    fire; for then Christ's works, His love, His mercy, His righteous-
                    ness, will ascend before God, as a cloud of holy, fragrant in-
                    cense, wholly acceptable."—Testimonies to Ministers, page

           Part 3       Promise: What is the threefold promise to overcomers in
        SARDIS III   Sardis?

                        "Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not
                     defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white:
                     for they are worthy. He that overcometh, the same shall be
                     clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out
                     of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my
                     Father, and before his angels." Rev. 3:4, 5.

                          "Because of their faith this honor [to walk with Jesus in
                     white] is bestowed on them. In this life they did not boast, nor
                     lift up their souls unto vanity. With intensity of desire, with a
                     pure, holy faith, they grasped the promise of eternal riches.
                     Their one desire was to be like Christ. Ever they kept the stan-
                     dard of righteousness uplifted. To them is given an eternal
                     weight of glory, because on the earth they walked with God,
                     keeping themselves unspotted from the world, revealing to
                     their fellow beings the righteousness of Christ."—Ellen G.
                     White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 7, p. 960.
                          "How wonderful to know that even if our names are blotted
                     from the record books of man and for the sake of the gospel
                     we are disowned by friends and family, yet in heaven our High
                     Priest claims us as His own and confesses our names before
                     His Father! Honor and security are ours, and we can look
                     confidently into the future, knowing that soon our Lord will
                     come and receive us unto Himself."—R. A. Anderson, Unfolding

                     saith unto the churches." Verse 6.

 THINK IT THROUGH       "Who is so favored as to be numbered among these few in
                     Sardis? Are you? Am I? Who are among this number? Is it not
                     best for us to inquire into this matter, in order that we may learn

                     walk with Christ. They will pray and believe and work to save
                     the souls that are ready to perish. These are trying to break

    PHILADELPHIA I   write." Rev. 3:7, first part.
                        Identification: What are the three identifying marks of the
                     Author of the letter to Philadelphia?
                        "These things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that
                     hath the key of David, he that openeth, and no man shutteth;
                     and shutteth, and no man openeth." Verse 7, last part.
                        "He that is holy. This title is equivalent to 'the Holy One,'
                     used of God in the OT (Isa. 40:25; Hab. 3:3). . . .

                     Compare Rev. 5:5; 22:16....
                        "He that openeth. That is, with 'the key of David.' Christ
                     has full authority to open and to shut, to carry the plan of
                     redemption forward to success."—SDA Bible Commentary,
                     on Rev. 3:7.
                         Knowledge: What commendable works did Jesus attribute
                     to the Philadelphia Christians?
                        "I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open
                     door, and no man can shut it; for thou hast a little strength,
                     and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name."
                     Verse 8.
                       Philadelphia and Smyrna received only commendation from
                     Jesus. The other five were rebuked. The Philadelphians had
                     been faithful in spite of the opposition from the "synagogue of
                     Satan."
                        What is meant by the "open door" in verse eight?
                        Verses seven and eight have a special historical significance
                     to Seventh-day Adventists. Additional reading on this point is
                     found in Early Writings, pages 42-45 and Selected Messages,
                     Bk. 1, pp. 62-64.

                     us learn to approach unto Him as through an open door, be-

                                                                           April 26

           Part 6         The beginnings of the advent movement reach back into the
  PHILADELPHIA III   period of church history represented by the Philadelphia
                     church. Thus the Philadelphia period, along with Laodicea, has
                     significance for Seventh-day Adventists in a way that the other
                     five churches have not.
                          "Philadelphia represents that period in church history which
                     was ushered in by the evangelical preaching of the Wesleys,
                     Whitefield, Jonathan Edwards, and a multitude of others. 'The
                     world is my parish,' declared John Wesley, whose message of
                      'free grace' challenged the Calvinistic theology of 'election.'
                     This evangelical movement became the prelude to the era of
                     modern missions....
                          "The Philadelphia period culminated in the great second-
                      advent awakening of the nineteenth century. Through the study
                      of Daniel and the Revelation, and the interpretation of Christ's
                      own prophecy, a profound conviction came to Christendom
                      that the return of Christ was at hand. . . . The prophetic
                      periods of the 1260 days, as relating to the antichrist, and the
                      2300 days, which relate to the message of the judgment, re-
                      ceived particular attention. Prophetic conferences convened,
                      and these gave impetus to one of the greatest eras of preaching
                      since the days of the apostles."—R. A. Anderson, Unfolding
                      the Revelation, pages 38, 39.
                           The Philadelphia period led up to the time when our Lord
                       entered upon the closing phase of His mediatorial work in the
                       heavenly sanctuary. In the earthly sanctuary there was a daily
                       service, and also a yearly service—the Day of Atonement. This
                       was regarded as a day of judgment when the high priest
                       climaxed his mediatorial work for Israel. That service was a
                       type of Christ's priestly work in heaven. Having entered the
                       most holy apartment of the heavenly sanctuary, He is now our
                       Judge in the pre-advent judgment. From our earliest days,
                       Seventh-day Adventists have believed that this work began
                       in 1844. When our High Priest finishes His work of intercession,
                       the door of mercy will close forever. But today it is an "open
                       door" for all who will accept His grace and be saved. Soon
                       it will be too late.
 THINK IT THROUGH       What meaning do the early days of the advent movement
                      have for me?
                         "In reviewing our past history, having traveled over every
                      step of advance to our present standing, I can say, Praise God!
                      As I see what the Lord has wrought, I am filled with astonish-
                      ment, and with confidence in Christ as leader. We have noth-

            Part 1      Instructions: "And unto the angel of the church of the
         LAODICEA    Laodiceans write." Rev. 3:14, first part.

                         Identification: By what three appellations does Jesus iden-
                     tify Himself to the believers of Laodicea?

                        "These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness,
                     the beginning of the creation of God." Verse 14, last part.

                         Both Hebrews and Christans have used "amen" as an ac-
                     clamation, to give confirmation to the words spoken by another
                     in worship. Amen as a name for Jesus points to Him as the
                     One who has confirmed God's word in human life. He was the
                     faithful and true Witness, and thus the message in His letter to
                     Laodicea was trustworthy. He knew the truth and stated it.
                         "Beginning. Gr. arche, a word that has both a passive and
                     an active sense. Taken passively, it refers to that which is
                     acted upon at the beginning. So interpreted here, it would
                     mean that Christ was the first creature created. But this ob-
                     viously could not be the correct translation, for Christ is not a
                     created being. Taken actively, arche refers to that which ini-
                     tiates an action, a first cause, a prime mover. So understood
                     here, it declares Christ to be the Creator. Such is plainly the
                     meaning of the present passage, for Christ is portrayed re-
                     peatedly in this same role elsewhere in the NT."—SDA Bible
                     Commentary, on Rev. 3:14.
                         "Christ is the pre-existent, self-existent Son of God. . . In
                     speaking of his pre-existence, Christ carries the mind back
                     through dateless ages. He assures us that there never was a
                     time when He was not in close fellowship with the eternal God.
                     He to whose voice the Jews were then listening had been with
                     God as one brought up with Him.. ..
                         "He was equal with God, infinite and omnipotent. . . . He
                     is the eternal, self-existent Son."—Evangelism, page 615.

 THINK IT THROUGH       In what ways does my life fail of sounding an "Amen" to
                     the "Amen" of Jesus?

                        "By coming to dwell with us, Jesus was to reveal God both
                     to men and to angels. He was the Word of God,—God's thought
                     made audible. In His prayer for His disciples He says, 'I have
                     declared unto them Thy name,'—'merciful and gracious, long-
                     suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth,'—'that the love
                     wherewith Thou hast loved Me may be in them, and I in
                     them.' "—The Desire of Ages, page 19.

           Part 2     Knowledge: What is Jesus' description of the Laodicean's
        LAODICEA  works?
                      "I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I
                  would thou wert cold or hot. So then because thou art luke-
                  warm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my
                  mouth." Rev. 3:15,16.
                      Jesus here described the relationship of the church to Him-
                  self. He judged them on a scale of three points: (1) hot, (2)
                  cold, or (3) lukewarm, listed in order of preference.
                      "The word for cold is psuchros; and it can mean cold to
                  the point of freezing. . . . The word for hot is zestos; and it
                  means hot to the boiling point. The word for tepid is chliaros
                  . . a nauseating effect."—William Barclay, The Revelation of
                  John, Vol. 1, p. 178.
                      "The message to the Laodicean church applies most de-
                  cidedly to those whose religious experience is insipid, who
                  do not bear decided witness in favor of the truth."—Ellen G.
                  White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 7, p. 962.
                      "Were you cold, there would be some hope that you would
                  be converted; but where self-righteousness girds one about,
                  instead of the righteousness of Christ, the deception is so
                  difficult to be seen, and the self-righteousness so hard to be
                  put away, that the case is the most difficult to reach. An un-
                   converted, godless sinner stands in a more favorable condition
                  than such."—Testimonies, Vol. 2, p. 176.
 THINK IT THROUGH      Where do I fit on the "warmth scale" of Christian living?
                       "The Laodicean message applies to the people of God who
                  profess to believe present truth. . . . They profess to love the
                   truth, yet are deficient in Christian fervor and devotion. They
                  dare not give up wholly and run the risk of the unbeliever, yet
                  they are unwilling to die to self and follow out closely the prin-
                  ciples of their faith.
                       "The only hope for the Laodiceans is a clear view of their
                   standing before God, a knowledge of the nature of their dis-
                   ease. They are neither cold nor hot; they occupy a neutral
                   position, and at the same time flatter themselves that they are
                   in need of nothing. The True Witness hates this lukewarmness.
                   He loathes the indifference of this class of persons. Said He: 'I
                   would thou wert cold or hot.' Like lukewarm water, they are
                   nauseous to His taste. They are neither unconcerned nor sel-
                   fishly stubborn. They do not engage thoroughly and heartily in
                   the work of God, identifying themselves with its interests; but
                   they hold aloof and are ready to leave their posts when their

          LAODICEA    and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and
                      knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor,
                      and blind, and naked." Rev. 3:17.
                          The message to Laodicea is the opposite of the message to
                      Smyrna. In spite of Smyrna's poverty Jesus declares her to be
                      rich. In spite of Laodicea's wealth Jesus declares her to be im-
                      poverished.
                          While Jesus finds nothing to commend in Laodicea, He
                      lovingly points out their need and tenderly appeals to them
                      to repent.
                          Laodicean believers imagine themselves wealthy in Christian
                      graces, and fancy themselves well-off. They know not their
                      true poverty.
                          "The Laodicean message is applicable to the church at this
                      time. Do you believe this message? Have you hearts that feel?
                      Or are you constantly saying, We are rich and increased in

                          "The Laodicean message applies to all who profess to keep
                      the law of God, and yet are not doers of it. We are not to be
                      selfish in anything. Every phase of the Christian life is to be
                      a representation of the life of Christ. If it is not, we shall hear
                      the terrible words, 'I know you not.' "—Ellen G. White Com-
                      ments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 7, pp. 961, 962.
 THINK IT THROUGH         How can I discover the ways in which I am self-deceived?
                         "It is when the vital principles of the kingdom of God are
                      lost sight of, that ceremonies become multitudinous and ex-
                      travagant. It is when the character building is neglected, when
                      the adornment of the soul is lacking, when the simplicity of
                      godliness is despised, that pride and love of display demand
                      magnificent church edifices, splendid adornings, and impos-
                      ing ceremonials. But in all this God is not honored. He values
                      His church, not for its external advantages, but for the sincere
                      piety which distinguishes it from the world. He estimates it
                      according to the growth of its members in the knowledge of
                      Christ, according to their progress in spiritual experience. He
                      looks for the principles of love and goodness. Not all the
                      beauty of art can bear comparison with the beauty of temper
                      and character to be revealed in those who are Christ's repre-
                      sentatives.
                         "A congregation may be the poorest in the land. It may be
                      without the attractions of any outward show; but if the mem-
                      bers possess the principles of the character of Christ, angels
                      will unite with them in their worship. The praise and thanks-
                      giving from grateful hearts will ascend to God as a sweet
                      oblation."—Prophets and Kings, pages 565, 566.

Letters From Jesus IV       LESSON 5                               ❑ Wednesday
                                                                         May 1

           Part 4      Counsel: What three counsels did Jesus give to Laodicea?
        LAODICEA       "I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou
                    mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be
                    clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear;
                    and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see."
                    Rev. 3:18.
                        In verse 17 Jesus identifies the lukewarm condition of the
                    Laodicean believers as self-satisfaction—they felt no need.
                    These counsels correspond to the poverty, nakedness, and
                    blindness in verse 17.
                        The description of a Laodicean condition begins: "I know
                    thy works."
                      What elements of the Christian life form the base of works?
                    See Paul's answer in Galatians 5:6.
                        "The gold mentioned by Christ, the True Witness, which all
                    must have, has been shown me to be faith and love combined,
                    and love takes the precedence of faith."—Testimonies, Vol.
                    2, p. 36.
                        "The white raiment is the righteousness of Christ that may
                    be wrought into the character. Purity of heart, purity of motive,
                    will characterize every one who is washing his robe, and mak-
                    ing it white in the blood of the Lamb.
                        "The eye is the sensitive conscience, the inner light, of the
                    mind. Upon its correct view of things the spiritual healthfulness
                    of the whole soul and being depends. The 'eyesalve,' the Word
                    of God, makes the conscience smart under its application; for
                    it convicts of sin. But the smarting is necessary that the heal-
                    ing may follow, and the eye be single to the glory of God."
                    —Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 7,
                    p. 965.
 THINK IT THROUGH     What is my true spiritual condition? How shall I know
                    whether or not I am "blind"?

                       "Brethren and sisters, are your thoughts after this order?
                    `These sharp, decided words do not mean me; I am in a fairly
                    good condition spiritually, though I may not have all the fervor
                    and zeal that some have. I believe the truth. Those to whom
                    this message belongs may take it. I think some need it.' You
                    who think and reason thus, be assured that you are the very
                    ones to whom this message belongs. While the costly wares
                    of heaven are open before you, draw nigh and buy that which
                    you have lost—the gold of love and faith, and the white raiment
                    which is the righteousness of Christ."—Ellen G. White Com-

            Part 5      Counsel, continued: How does the Christian "buy" (Rev.
         LAODICEA    3:18) the spiritual wares of the heavenly Merchant? Are there
                     any other elements in buying besides paying? See Isaiah 55:1.

                        "Make some effort. These precious treasures will not drop
                     upon us without some exertion on our part. We must buy—
                     'be zealous and repent' of our lukewarm state. We must be
                     awake to see our wrongs, to search for our sins, and to zeal-
                     ously repent of them."—Testimonies, Vol. 1, p. 142.
                        What encouragement to zeal and repentance did Jesus
                     give? Rev. 3:19.
                        The Greek for "zealous" is related to "hot" in verse 15.
                        "It is evident that the Laodiceans are not a rejected and
                     cast-off people as some contend. 'Sharp has been His rebuke
                     to this lukewarm church. But it does not mean that He had
                     turned away and abandoned them, or was about to do so. It
                     means just the reverse. For He was standing near, and ready
                     to supply their need, and to enrich them with all His treasure;
                     and His rebuke was a proof of His unchanging love.' (Philip
                     Mauro, Of Things Which Soon Must Come to Pass, page
                     135.) ...
                        "How different is the attitude of Christ toward His remnant
                     people from that of their enemies, whose rebuke is the rebuke
                     of hate; whose motive is to tear down and destroy. It is Christ
                     who reproves His people, and He alone is qualified, because
                     of His unchanging love. He has never delegated this work to
                     enemies or disgruntled apostates, whose purpose is to scatter
                     those whom Christ has gathered within His fold and to tear
                     down what He has built up. Those who receive the Laodicean
                     message as coming from Christ because of His love will never
                     join those who denounce the church as being rejected by Him
                     and unworthy of His love. . . .
                        "The genuine Christian will make a personal application of
                     the Laodicean message to his own life rather than use it to
                     denounce and discourage others."—Taylor G. Bunch, The
                     Seven Epistles of Christ, pages 244, 245.

 THINK IT THROUGH        What lesson for the human relationships of the Christian
                     is found in the appeal of Jesus to the Laodiceans in verse 19?

                        "I saw that this call to the Laodicean church will affect
                     souls. A becoming zeal is called for by God on our part. We
                     must repent, throw away our whole feelings, feel our destitu-
                     tion, buy gold that we may be rich, eyesalve that we may see,

           Part 6      Counsel, continued: What is the door in verse 20? Who
        LAODICEA    knocks, and who opens?
                      "Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear
                    my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will
                    sup with him, and he with me." Rev. 3:20.
                        "The form of the Greek verb implies that Christ has taken
                    His stand at the door and remains there. He never tires of
                    offering His blessed presence to all who will receive Him."—
                    SDA Bible Commentary, on Rev. 3:20.
                         "A door is either the means of entrance or a barrier against
                    it. It either lets a person in or keeps him out, according to the
                    will of the householder. The locks and bars are on the inside.
                    The door that keeps the Saviour out is barred by the sinner,
                    and He cannot enter till the barriers are removed."—Taylor
                    G. Bunch, The Seven Epistles of Christ, page 248.
                         Promise: "To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with
                    me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down
                    with my Father in his throne." Rev. 3:21.
                       The victory to be gained by the believer is the same victory
                    Jesus gained, and it must be gained in the same spirit of sub-
                    mission. He chose the will of the Father in preference to His
                    own will. He conquered by the Spirit's power. The believer who
                    shares Jesus' victory will share also His reward.
                       Appeal: "He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit
                    saith unto the churches." Rev. 3:22.
                       The message to Laodicea, and to the other six churches as
                    well, was the gospel message presented according to the needs
                    of each church. Each message was presented through symbols
                    that were appropriate to each city. The Spirit, who spoke in
                    each letter, still illuminates the gospel for our personal cir-
                    cumstances if only we will listen.
 THINK IT THROUGH      What is meant in experience by the words of Jesus "sit
                    with me in my throne"?
                        "The only defense against evil is the indwelling of Christ in
                    the heart through faith in His righteousness. Unless we become
                    vitally connected with God, we can never resist the unhallowed
                    effects of self-love, self-indulgence, and temptation to sin. We
                    may leave off many bad habits, for the time we may part com-
                    pany with Satan; but without a vital connection with God,
                    through the surrender of ourselves to Him moment by moment,
                    we shall be overcome. Without a personal acquaintance with
                    Christ, and a continual communion, we are at the mercy of
                    the enemy, and shall do his bidding in the end."—The Desire

  Suddenly the reader of Revelation finds his attention shifted from the
seven churches in Asia to the center of the universe. He has read of human
believers and their problems in the battle with Satan. Now his thoughts are
directed to the throne of the universe and the nature of the One who occupies
it. It is a strong contrast, from viewing poor, weak, mortals to beholding the
                                                                      LESSON 6
                                                                      May 5-11
holy and eternal God. John does not emphasize the contrast. Rather he sees
in chapter five that God fights the same foe that the believers of Asia Minor
fought. But that is going ahead of this week's lesson.
    The scenes and songs of chapter four establish the basis of the praise
and worship of God. Why is this necessary? Because an assumption of a
controversy underlies Revelation. First hinted at in chapter 1:5 where John
refers to Jesus as having freed us from sin by His blood, it surfaces every
time a promise is made to the overcomer throughout the seven letters.
    Further, in the letters the controversy shows up in the opposition to:
    1.   The Nicolaitanes              5. The soiled garments of believers
    2.   The synagogue of Satan        6. Again the synagogue of Satan
    3.   The teachings of Balaam       7. The lukewarmness of believers
    4.   Jezebel
   The information revealed in chapter four not only describes the essential
characteristic of God, but also vindicates Him from accusations that:He is
unworthy to stand at the head of the universe.
   The statement in verse 1, "I will shew thee things which must be here-
after," should warn us that this vision of God on His throne serves to intro-
duce the vision and does not stand alone.
   Ezekiel saw a vision of God similar to the vision John reports in Revela-
tion 4. Ellen G. White wrote of Ezekiel's vision:
    "While nations have rejected God's principles, and in this rejection have
wrought their own ruin, yet a divine, overruling purpose has manifestly been
at work throughout the ages. It was this that the prophet Ezekiel saw in the
wonderful representation given him during his exile in the land of the Chal-
deans, when before his astonished gaze were portrayed the symbols.that
revealed an overruling Power that has to do with the affairs of earthly rulers."
—Prophets and Kings, page 535.
    The scope of Revelation exceeds that of Ezekiel, for it deals specifically
with the controversy with Satan (see chapter 12). Ellen White, when speaking
of the rainbow above the throne, stated that "it testifies to the universe that
God will never forsake His people in their struggle with evil."—The Desire
of Ages, page 493. The vision of the throne assures the reader that God is
in charge of the universe because He has the right to be in charge, and He
will not forsake the battle against sin.

            Part 1      Who was the speaker noted in verse 1? Compare Rev.
       THE THRONE    1:10-13.

                         "After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in
                     heaven: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of
                     a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and
                     I will shew thee things which must be hereafter." Rev. 4:1.

                        In vision John is taken to heaven. However, everything that
                     he sees in heaven is not actually there. For instance, Mrs.
                     White said, "Satan appeared to be by the throne, trying to
                     carry on the work of God." She later explained this comment:
                     "Neither did I ever think that any mortal could suppose that
                     I believed that Satan was actually in the New Jerusalem. But
                     did not John see the great red dragon in heaven?"—Early
                     Writings, page 92. The mention of a lamb in John's report con-
                     firms the symbolic nature of this vision.

                        What first attracted John's attention? Rev. 4:2.


                         Throughout chapter 4 the throne holds the center of atten-
                     tion. John uses the word 12 times. The persons and objects
                     that John saw were oriented to the throne, and the activity
                     recorded here focused on it. A throne denotes sovereignty. It
                     is the official chair for the ruler of the realm.

                        What was John's description of the King? Rev. 4:3.

                        The rainbow connects this scene with the Flood story,
                     where the bow symbolizes God's promise never to flood the
                     world again.
                        "As the bow in the cloud is formed by the union of the
                     sunlight and the shower, so the rainbow encircling the throne
                     represents the combined power of mercy and justice. It is not
                     justice alone that is to be maintained; for this would eclipse
                     the glory of the rainbow of promise above the throne; man
                     could see only the penalty of the law. Were there no justice, no
                     penalty, there would be no stability to the government of God.

                                                                          May 6

          Part 2       Whom did John see around the throne?
     AROUND THE
                       "And round about the throne were four and twenty seats:
       THRONE I     and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting,
                    clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns
                    of gold." Rev. 4:4.

                       There has been much speculation about the identity of the
                    twenty-four elders. The speculation has not generally aided
                    in understanding the book of Revelation. In today's lesson we
                    will note the place they hold in the picture John has described
                    in chapter 4, but let us forego the effort at positive identifica-
                    tion.
                       The vision of the throne is a symbolic one. The elders have
                    meaning, and we shall seek meaning rather than identity.
                       In Israel the word "elder" designated a person holding an
                    "official rank and position among their brethren. . . . God
                    directed Moses to choose 70 elders to aid him in his great
                    responsibility of governing Israel."—SDA Bible Dictionary,
                    page 301. In the Christian church the word "elder" referred
                    to a church leader. In both the Old and New Testaments there
                    was a responsibility of service delegated to an elder.
                        These twenty-four elders serve at the throne of God. Seated
                    on thrones, they apparently participate in the administration of
                    the universe.

                       What proceeded out of the throne? Rev. 4:5.

                       These evidences of storm contrast with the rainbow about
                    the throne. Thunder and lightning accompanied the giving of
                    the law on Sinai. The bow declared God's mercy. The thunder
                    and lightning declared His justice.

 THINK IT THROUGH     Summarize the meanings of the symbols in verses 1-5.
                    What is the message?

                       "It is the mingling of judgment and mercy that makes salva-
                    tion full and complete. It is the blending of the two that leads
                    us, as we view the world's Redeemer and the law of Jehovah,
                    to exclaim, 'Thy gentleness hath made me great.' We know
                    that the gospel is a perfect and complete system, revealing
                    the immutability of the law of God. It inspires the heart with
                    hope, and with love for God. Mercy invites us to enter through
                    the gates into the city of God, and justice is sacrificed to
                    accord to every obedient soul full privileges as a member of
                    the royal family, a child of the heavenly King."—Ellen G. White

                                                                           May 7

            Part 3      What was the meaning of the seven lamps?
       AROUND THE       "And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunder-
         THRONE II   ings and voices: and there were seven lamps of fire burning
                     before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God." Rev.
                     4:5.

                         The seven lamps spoken of here (lampas) are not the same
                     seven candlesticks spoken of in Revelation 1:13 (luchnos). The
                     seven lamps are equated with one Spirit (Zech. 4:2-6) which
                     is the Spirit of God (Rev. 3:1). They symbolize not only the
                     continual presence of God, as did the lamps in the earthly
                     sanctuary (Ex. 37:23), but also the sevenfold fullness of the
                     Spirit given to the church. See The Acts of the Apostles, pages
                     37, 38.

                        What beings did John see on each side of the throne?
                     Verses 6, 7, RSV.

                        These symbolic creatures resemble those seen by Ezekiel.
                     Ellen G. White interpreted them simply as "heavenly beings."
                     Testimonies, Vol. 5, p. 751.
                        If we interpret the meaning of these four faces according
                     to the characteristics of each we can find the following Biblical
                     definitions:
                        Lion—strength. Rev. 5:5; Gen. 49:9.
                        Calf (ox)—loyalty and sacrifice. Isa. 1:3; see Gospel Work-
                     ers, page 294.
                        Man—intelligence and choice. Gen. 1:27; Joshua 24: 14, 15.
                        Eagle—swiftness. Deut. 28:49.
                        John described these four creatures as "full of eyes." Eyes
                     are used in Revelation 5:6 to represent the fullness of the
                     Spirit. The angels are full of God's Spirit and are channels to
                     disseminate His blessings, watchcare, and concern.
                        "The seraphim before the throne are so filled with rever-
                     ential awe in beholding the glory of God that they do not for
                     an instarn look upon themselves with self-complacency, or in
                     admiration of themselves or one another. Their praise and
                     glory are for the Lord of Hosts. . . . They are fully satisfied
                     to glorify God; and in His presence, beneath His smile of ap-
                     probation, they wish for nothing more. In bearing His image,
                     in doing His service and worshiping Him, their highest ambi-
                     tion is fully reached."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible

In Praise of God     LESSON 6                                      ❑ Wednesday
                                                                         May 8

           Part 4      What was the song that the living creatures constantly
      THE LIVING    sang?
 CREATURES' SONG
                       "And the four beasts had each of them six wings about
                    him; and they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day
                    and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty,
                    which was, and is, and is to come." Rev. 4:8.


                        The description of the throne and its surroundings in the
                    first part of chapter 4 have been given by John to provide the
                    setting for this song. Other songs follow throughout Revelation.
                    These songs present the basic message of the Apocalypse.
                    Therefore special attention will be given to these songs as we
                    come to them in our study of Revelation.

                       What three attributes of God are included in this song?


                       The holiness of God can also be expressed in positive terms,
                    but in a sinful world God's holiness can be most readily
                    grasped as opposition to sin as expressed in His law. In the
                    book of Revelation the starting point of the entire message is
                    God's unalterable opposition to sin. Without this there is no
                    controversy, and the existence of controversy is a basic as-
                    sumption in Revelation.
                       This brief song expresses what God is like in His (1) char-
                    acter (holy), (2) position (Lord God Almighty), and (3) existence
                    (was, is, is to come). These three attributes are the root of
                    (1) morality, (2) order, and (3) life. The God of morality, order,
                    and life is the source from whom the universe springs.

 THINK IT THROUGH      How can I grow in reverence for the Almighty, while
                    growing in love for Him as my Heavenly Father?


                       "To the omnipotence of the King of kings our covenant-
                    keeping God unites the gentleness and care of the tender
                    shepherd. His power is absolute, and it is the pledge of the
                    sure fulfillment of His promises to all who trust in Him. He has
                    means for the removal of every difficulty, that those who serve
                    Him and respect the means He employs may be sustained.
                    His love is as far above all other love as the heavens are above

             Part 5      In the scene of chapter 4 what happened when the living
        WORSHIP BY    creatures sang?
         24 ELDERS       "And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks
                      to him that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever,
                      the four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on
                      the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever,
                      and cast their crowns before the throne." Rev. 4:9, 10.
                           The purpose of chapter four is to reveal God the Father
                      and the ways in which He is related to the living universe. The
                      song of the living creatures revealed the attributes that God
                      possesses in Himself. The elders then had a message to add
                       to that of the creatures. That message we will study tomorrow.
                      Today we will note the acts of worship by the elders.
                          In the act of worship, the elders fell down before God.
                      The utmost reverence is the only appropriate approach to
                      God. A flippant approach to God in the worship service does
                      not correspond to His majesty. "Where have our brethren
                      obtained the idea that they should stand upon their feet when
                      praying to God? . . . As I beheld him standing upright upon
                      his feet while his lips were about to open in prayer to God,
                      my soul was stirred within me to give him an open rebuke.
                      Calling him by name, I said, 'Get down upon your knees.' This
                      is the proper position always."—Selected Messages, Bk. 2, p.
                      311.
                          They also cast down their crowns before the throne. This
                      was a spontaneous gesture, expressive of their inmost attitudes.
                      No stoic unresponsiveness here. This can come only when
                      there is a living, loving relationship with Him who is altogether
                      lovely. "The evil of formal worship cannot be too strongly de-
                      picted, but no words can properly set forth the deep blessed-
                      ness of genuine worship. When human beings sing with the
                      spirit and the understanding, heavenly musicians take up the
                      strain."—Testimonies, Vol. 9, p. 143.
                          "To the humble, believing soul, the house of God on earth
                      is the gate of heaven. The song of praise, the prayer, the words
                      spoken by Christ's representatives, are God's appointed agen-
                      cies to prepare a people for the church above, for that loftier

                      the work of saving souls. All the service should be conducted
                      with solemnity and awe, as if in the visible presence of the

            Part 6      Why is God worthy to be worshiped?
   THE 24 ELDERS'       "Thou art worthy, 0 Lord, to receive glory and honour and
             SONG    power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure
                     they are and were created." Rev. 4:11.

                         "The duty to worship God is based upon the fact that He is
                     the Creator and that to Him all other beings owe their exis-
                     tence. And wherever, in the Bible, His claim to reverence and
                     worship, above the gods of the heathen, is presented, there
                     is cited the evidence of His creative power. 'All the gods of
                     the nations are idols: but the Lord made the heavens.' Psalm
                     96:5. 'To whom then will ye liken Me, or shall I be equal? saith
                     the Holy One. Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath
                     created these things.' Thus saith the Lord that created the
                     heavens; God Himself that formed the earth and made it:
                     . . . I am the Lord; and there is none else.' Isaiah 40:25, 26;
                     45:18. Says the psalmist: 'Know ye that the Lord He is God: it
                     is He that hath made us, and not we ourselves.' 0 come, let
                     us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the Lord our
                     Maker.' Psalms 100:3; 95:6. And the holy beings who worship
                     God in heaven state, as the reason why their homage is due
                     to Him: 'Thou art worthy, 0 Lord, to receive glory and honor
                     and power: for Thou hast created all things.' Revelation 4:11."
                     —The Great Controversy, pages 436, 437.
                          The message of the song of the living creatures centered
                      on what God is in character, position, and existence. The mes-
                     sage of the song of the 24 elders centered on what God has
                      done. Because God created all things, then it is appropriate
                      that every intelligent being shall voluntarily praise God for
                      giving to them their existence.
                          The two songs are the important parts of chapter 4. They
                      convey important information about God that could not be
                      known by seeing Him and His surroundings. Even in God's
                      presence these vital truths take the form of a verbal message.
                          These two messages prepare the reader for the scenes
                      presented in chapter 5.

 THINK IT THROUGH       What or whom do I regard supremely, judging by the
                     course of my life?
                        "Jehovah, the eternal, self-existent, uncreated One, Himself
                     the source and sustainer of all, is alone entitled to supreme
                     reverence and worship. Man is forbidden to give to any other
                     object the first place in his affections or his service. Whatever
                     we cherish that tends to lessen our love for God or to interfere
                     with the service due Him, of that do we make a god."—Sons

   "The priest is about to slay the
victim; but the knife drops from his
nerveless hand, and the lamb es-
capes. Type has met antitype in the
death of God's Son. The great sacri-
fice has been made. The way into the
holiest is laid open. A new and living
way is prepared for all. No longer
need sinful, sorrowing humanity
await the coming of the high priest.
Henceforth the Saviour was to offi-
ciate as priest and advocate in the

                                                                May 12-18




"And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under
the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard
I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that
sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever." Rev. 5:13.




               Jesus
    Ellen G. White comments: "The fifth chapter of Revelation needs to
be closely studied. It is of great importance to those who shall act a part
in the work of God for these last days. There are some who are deceived.
They do not realize what is coming on the earth. Those who have per-
mitted their minds to become beclouded in regard to what constitutes
sin are fearfully deceived. Unless they make a decided change they will
be found wanting when God pronounces judgment upon the children of
men. They have transgressed the law and broken the everlasting cove-
nant, and they will receive according to their works."—Testimonies, Vol.
9, p. 267.
    In the fifth chapter the action centers around God, who holds a book;
 the Lamb, Jesus, who takes the book in His own hand; and the response
of created beings to the Lamb's action. Thus is presented symbolically
the entrusting of a special work to Jesus Christ that leads to universal
acclamation.
    There is much to think about in this chapter, and the lesson for this
 week does not exhaust the topic. The lesson presents a point of begin-
 ning, but there is much that lies beyond. To think through the meaning
 of this chapter is to center the thoughts on Jesus and His relation to the
 Father and to the created beings of the universe. Note the symbols, the
 action, and the songs, and seek the meaning of this vision that unfolds
 the work that is placed in Jesus' hands.

                                                                              May 12

             Part 1      Who held the sealed scroll? Rev. 5:1.
       THE ANGEL'S        He whom the attendants about the throne acclaimed holy,
         QUESTION     mighty, eternal, and worthy of worship because He created all
                      things, John saw holding a sealed scroll. It was perfectly
                      sealed-7 seals—and all writing space was filled. Who wrote
                      the scroll? Who sealed it? The record states only that the
                      Creator held the scroll in His hand.
                          Ellen G. White wrote the following very revealing remark
                      about the scroll:
                          "Thus the Jewish leaders made their choice. Their decision
                      was registered in the book which John saw in the hand of Him
                      that sat upon the throne, the book which no man could open.
                      In all its vindictiveness this decision will appear before them
                      in the day when this book is unsealed by the Lion of the tribe
                      of Judah."—Christ's Object Lessons, page 294.
                          What question did the "strong angel" ask? What response
                      did he receive?
                          "And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice,
                      Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals
                      thereof? And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under
                      the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon."
                      Rev. 5:2, 3.
                         By implication the above quotation from Christ's Object Les-
                      sons can lead us to view the record of Lucifer's rebellion as the
                      "sealed book." Lucifer disguised himself in such a way that
                      his true purposes could not immediately be revealed to cre-
                      ated beings. "Until fully developed it could not be made to
                      appear the evil thing it was; ... [on the other hand] God could
                      employ only such means as were consistent with truth and
                      righteousness."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pages 41, 42.
                         "Had Satan and his host then been left to reap the full
                      result of their sin, they would have perished; but it would not
                      have been apparent to heavenly beings that this was the in-
                      evitable result of sin. A doubt of God's goodness would have
                      remained in their minds as evil seed, to produce its deadly
                      fruit of sin and woe."—The Desire of Ages, page 764.
                         How would Satan and other rebels ever be brought to judg-
                      ment? The sealed scroll posed this basic question.
                         In vision, what was John's reaction to the unavailability
                      of a man to open the scroll? Rev. 5:4.
                         What circumstance ever came to the hand of God that
                      would cause one to weep? "The fall of man filled all heaven
                      with sorrow.... Angels ceased their songs of praise. Through-
                      out the heavenly courts there was mourning for the ruin that
                      sin had wrought."—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 63.

In Praise of Jesus LESSON 7                                           ❑ Monday
                                                                        May 13

           Part 2      Who was found to open the sealed scroll?
     THE ELDER'S
         ANSWER        "And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold,
                    the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed
                    to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof." Rev.
                    5:5.

                       These two names are Messianic symbols. See Genesis
                    49:9, 10 and Isaiah 11:1, 10. Jesus was born of the tribe of
                    Judah, the family of David. A promise of rulership accom-
                    panied the designation of Judah as a lion, and a promise of
                    the Spirit and wisdom accompanied the prophecy of the Root.
                    This is to say that Jesus was another David—not just another
                    king but one led by the Spirit and successful in kingship.

                       Why could Jesus open the scroll? Verse 5, last part.

                       The ability to open the scroll resided in Jesus, not because
                    He bore the symbolic names, but because He lived up to His
                    names—He conquered. Whom had He conquered?
                        "Christ did not yield up His life till He had accomplished
                    the work which He came to do, and with His parting breath He
                    exclaimed, 'It is finished.' John 19:30. The battle had been
                    won. His right hand and His holy arm had gotten Him the
                    victory. As a Conqueror He planted His banner on the eternal
                    heights. Was there not joy among the angels? All heaven
                    triumphed in the Saviour's victory. Satan was defeated, and
                    knew that his kingdom was lost."—The Desire of Ages, page
                    758.

 THINK IT THROUGH     How can I be a conquerer over Satan and self as Jesus
                    was?

                       "Lessons need to be learned by all who shall step into
                    places where they are to be proved and tested by God, to see
                    whether they shall be registered day by day as faithful and
                    true stewards of God's entrusted talents. Have they shown
                    that they have the fear of God before them, whether they are
                    dealing with superiors, inferiors, or equals? They need to
                    cherish the truth as an abiding principle, that it may sanctify
                    the soul. The creating, transforming power of God's Holy Spirit
                    will make them copartners with Jesus Christ. Yoked up with
                    Christ, they can be more than conquerors through Him."—Tes-

                                                                           May 14

             Part 3      What was the condition of the Lamb as John saw Him?
          THE LAMB
                         "And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of
                      the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb
                      as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes,
                      which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the
                      earth." Rev. 5:6.

                          The One whom John now saw as a Lamb had been named
                      a Lion by one of the elders. The Lion was a Lamb.
                          "These symbols represent the union of omnipotent power
                      and self-sacrificing love. The Lion of Judah, so terrible to the
                      rejecters of His grace, will be the Lamb of God to the obe-
                      dient and faithful."—The Acts of the Apostles, page 589.
                          When John later saw symbols of Satan and earthly powers,
                      he saw beasts of prey. When he saw a symbol of Jesus, he
                      saw a Lamb. The kingdom of Jesus stands on truth proclaimed
                      in love. The world's kingdoms stand on coercion and force.
                      The lamblike quality of Jesus describes the method of His
                      kingdom. The lionlike quality describes the results.
                          The Lamb John saw was a dying Lamb, wounded by the
                      sacrificial knife. This weak creature took the scroll because
                      He could open it. At the center of the prophecy of the seven
                      seals was the death of Jesus. Without this the scroll would
                      remain perfectly sealed.
                          "As Christ in His expiring agony upon the cross cried out,
                      `It is finished' (John 19:30), a shout of triumph rang through
                      every world and through heaven itself. The great contest that
                      had been so long in progress in this world was now decided,
                      and Christ was conqueror. His death had answered the ques-
                      tion whether the Father and the Son had sufficient love for man
                      to exercise self-denial and a spirit of sacrifice. Satan had re-
                      vealed his true character as a liar and a murderer. It was seen
                      that the very same spirit with which he had ruled the children
                      of men who were under his power, he would have manifested
                      if permitted to control the intelligences of heaven. With one
                      voice the loyal universe united in extolling the divine admin-
                      istration."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pages 69, 70.
                          "The Lamb of God is represented before us as in the midst
                      of the throne of God. He is the great ordinance by which man
                      and God are united and commune together. Thus men are
                      represented as sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. This
                      is the appointed place of meeting between God and humanity."

           Part 4      In the "new song" what elements combined to define
  CREATURES' AND     "worthy"?
    ELDERS' SONG
                        "And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to
                     take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast
                     slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every
                     kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation; and host made
                     us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the
                     earth." Rev. 5:9, 10.


                        In Revelation 4:11 God is proclaimed as worthy of worship
                     because He created all things. In Revelation 5:9, 10 the Lamb,
                     Jesus, is pronounced worthy because He died to redeem men.
                     The song is new because the experience is new.
                         "Holy angels will join in the song of the redeemed. Though
                     they cannot sing from experimental knowledge, 'He hath
                     washed us in His own blood, and redeemed us unto God,' yet
                     they understand the great peril from which the people of God
                     have been saved. Were they not sent to lift up for them a
                     standard against the enemy? They can fully sympathize with
                     the glowing ecstasy of those who have overcome by the blood
                     of the Lamb and the word of their testimony."—Ellen G. White
                     Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 7, p. 922.
                         The one who would open the scroll needed not merely the
                     ability to open it, but also the worth to open it.
                         Observe that redemption is not included in the scroll. Be-
                     cause Jesus provided redemption, He can open the scroll.
                     Besides redemption the only other relation of men to Jesus
                     is judgment. Jesus provided redemption. He is qualified to
                     bring the rebellion to judgment. See Further Study reference.
                         Beginning with this song both the meaning of the songs
                     and the composition of the choir escalate, reaching a peak in
                     verse 13.

 THINK IT THROUGH       How can I develop a greater appreciation for Jesus?


                        "The mystery of the cross explains all other mysteries. In
                     the light that streams from Calvary the attributes of God which
                     had filled us with fear and awe appear beautiful and attractive.
                     Mercy, tenderness, and parental love are seen to blend with
                     holiness, justice, and power. While we behold the majesty of
                     His throne, high and lifted up, we see His character in its
                     gracious manifestations, and comprehend, as never before, the
                     significance of that endearing title, 'Our Father.' "—The Great

                                                                           May 16

            Part 5      What group next joined in singing praise to the Lamb?
 THE ANGELS' SONG        "And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round
                     about the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the
                     number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and
                     thousands of thousands; saying with a loud voice, Worthy
                     is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and
                     wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing."
                     Rev. 5:11, 12.
                         The previous song ascribed worthiness to Jesus to open
                     the sealed scroll, that is to judge the rebellion. This song states
                     that Jesus is worthy to receive worship. His worthiness to
                     receive worship accompanies the statement of His death. The
                     death of Jesus unmasked Satan's character and vindicated
                     the character of God. The angels were unprepared to grasp
                     the true nature of Lucifer's rebellion when he was cast out of
                     heaven. Now both issues have been clarified to their satisfac-
                     tion, but final resolution of the problem must await the fuller
                     revelation of the issues before the people of earth.
                         In regard to the ascension of Jesus, Ellen White wrote:
                         "With joy unutterable, rulers and principalities and powers
                     acknowledge the supremacy of the Prince of life. The angel
                     host prostrate themselves before Him, while the glad shout fills
                     all the courts of heaven, 'Worthy is the Lamb that was slain
                     to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and
                     honor, and glory, and blessing.' Rev. 5:12."—The Desire of
                     Ages, page 834.
                          What specific gifts was Jesus worthy to receive? Verse 12.
                        How many were there? What is the implication?
                        "All these heavenly beings have one object above all others,
                     in which they are intensely interested—His church in a world
                     of corruption. All these armies are in the service of the Prince
                     of heaven, exalting the Lamb of God, who taketh away the
                     sins of the world. They are working for Christ under His com-
                     mission, to save to the uttermost all who look to Him and
                     believe in Him. These heavenly intelligences are speeding on
                     their mission, doing for Christ that which Herod and Pilate did
                     against Him. They confederate together to uphold the honor
                     and glory of God. They are united in a holy alliance, in a grand
                     and sublime unity of purpose, to show forth the power and
                     compassion and love and glory of the crucified and risen
                     Saviour."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary,

                                                                           May 17

           Part 6       What additional singers joined with the angel choir? Rev.
  UNIVERSAL SONG     5:13, 14.

                       "From the standpoint of ancient cosmology, heaven, earth,
                    under the earth, and sea constitute the entire universe."—SDA
                    Bible Commentary, on Rev. 5:13.

                        To whom was this song addressed? Verse 13.

                        The singers addressed previous' songs to only one divine
                     person. The universal choir linked God and the Lamb together,
                     giving both the same praise in the same song. In writing about
                     events just before the destruction of sin, Ellen G. White states:
                        "Before the universe has been clearly presented the great
                     sacrifice made by the Father and the Son in man's behalf. The
                     hour has come when Christ occupies His rightful position and
                     is glorified above principalities and powers and every name
                     that is named."—The Great Controversy, page 671.
                        Then after the destruction of sin:
                        "As Jesus opens before them the riches of redemption and
                     the amazing achievements in the great controversy with Satan,
                     the hearts of the ransomed thrill with more fervent devotion,
                     and with more rapturous joy they sweep the harps of gold; and
                     ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands
                     of voices unite to swell the mighty chorus of praise. [Rev. 5:13
                     quoted.]"—The Great Controversy, page 678.

                       Who said "Amen"? Verse 14. Who sang the first song?
                     Rev. 4:8.

                        Note the crescendo that builds up in chapters four and five,
                     and the return to the beings in the immediate presence of God.
                        By "Amen," and the falling down in worship, these beings
                     who had previously affirmed the reasons for worship of God
                     now confirm and assent to the worship of God and the Lamb
                     jointly for eternity.

 THINK IT THROUGH       Reread Revelation 4 and 5.

                        "The cross of Christ will be the science and the song of the
                     redeemed through all eternity. In Christ glorified they will be-
                     hold Christ crucified. . . . That the Maker of all worlds, the
                     Arbiter of all destinies, should lay aside His glory and humiliate
                     Himself from love to man will ever excite the wonder and adora-
                     tion of the universe."—The Great Controversy, page 651.

   At the beginning of our study of the opening of the seals we
quote again the significant statement by Ellen G. White:
   "Thus the Jewish leaders made their choice. Their decision was
registered in the book which John saw in the hand of Him that sat
upon the throne, the book which no man could open. In all its vin-
dictiveness this decision will appear before them in the day when
this book is unsealed by the Lion of the tribe of Judah."—Christ's
Object Lessons, page 294.
   Seventh-day Adventists have usually interpreted the seven seals
as historical periods in the Christian dispensation. This view will




            wit.
be presented in this week's lesson. However, in the light of the
be
spirit of prophecy statement above it is clear that the opening of
the sealed scroll is still future and has to do with the time of judg-
ment. However the seals are interpreted, it must not be thought that
the scroll itself, or any portion of it is being opened at the time of
the historical period represented by each seal. The events de-
scribed give "flashback" pictures that will be presented in the
judgment to give evidence that will condemn those on trial.
    The material presented in Revelation 6 must be regarded as a
preview of a flashback—which is another way of saying that in the
seals are presented, usually symbolically, the events in history that
will be of particular significance in the judgment of the wicked.
    In The Great Controversy, pages 666-669, Ellen White described
the scene when "the books of record are opened" after the millen-
nium. This description includes the "flashback" pictures of events
in the great controversy which are presented before the lost, and
then a description of Satan's recall of all he did to thwart God's
plan. Thus the evidence includes what God has done for men as
well as what Satan and his followers have done against God and
other beings.
    There is the further consideration that "like the messages to the
seven churches, the scenes revealed when the seals are opened
may be regarded as having both a specific and a general applica-
tion. . . . The scenes may be viewed as particularly significant of
successive phases in the history of the church on earth."—SDA
Bible Commentary, Vol. 7, p. 775.
   For each seal we will note its corresponding historical period
and the general application of its meaning.

A Preview of Judgment LESSON 8                                           ❑   Sunday
                                                                             May 19

           Part 1        What scene came to John's view when the first seal was
 THE WHITE HORSE     broken?
                         "Now I saw when the Lamb opened one of th.e seven
                     seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures say, as with
                     a voice of thunder, 'Come!' And I saw, and behold, a white
                     horse, and its rider had a bow; and a crown was given to
                     him, and he went out conquering and to conquer." Rev. 6:1, 2,
                     RSV.
                        Historical: Biblically the horse represents war (Joel 2:1, 4,
                     5; Rev. 19:11, 12), and the equipment of the rider identifies
                     him as a warrior. The horses of Revelation ought not to be
                     compared with the horses of Zechariah 6:2, 3; for though there
                     are some similarities, the order of the horses is different, and
                     those in Zechariah draw chariots and bear no riders. See SDA
                     Bible Commentary, Vol. 7, p. 776.
                         White is the symbol of both purity and victory. And the rider
                     being crowned and bearing a bow is an impressive symbol of
                     the pure church during the first century of the Christian era
                     going forth "conquering and to conquer."
                         What was Paul's statement to the believers in Rome?
                     Rom. 1:8.
                         "What was the result of the outpouring of the Spirit on the
                     Day of Pentecost? The glad tidings of a risen Saviour were
                     carried to the uttermost parts of the inhabited world. . . . The
                     ambition of the believers was to reveal the likeness of Christ's
                     character and to labor for the enlargement of His kingdom."
                     —The Acts of the Apostles, page 48.
                         General: Jesus is the conqueror (Rev. 5:5), both personally,
                     and as above, through His church. The success of the gospel
                     is assured. The victory of Jesus at Calvary will be presented
                     before the hosts of the lost in the last judgment. See Further
                     Study reference below.
                         "Satan assailed Christ with his fiercest and most subtle
                     temptations, but he was repulsed in every conflict. Those bat-
                     tles were fought in our behalf; those victories make it possible
                     for us to conquer. . . . The fact that Christ has conquered
                     should inspire His followers with courage to fight manfully the
                     battle against sin and Satan."—The Great Controversy, page
                     510.
 THINK IT THROUGH        In what ways should I more fully join in Jesus' conquest
                     of the rebellion of sin?
                         "But Jesus our Advocate presents an effectual plea in behalf
                     of all who by repentance and faith have committed the keeping
                     of their souls to Him. He pleads their cause and vanquishes
                     their accuser by the mighty arguments of Calvary."—Testi-

A Preview of Judgment LESSON 8                                         ❑   Monday
                                                                           May 20

           Part 2      What was the action of the rider of the red horse?
   THE RED HORSE
                        "When he opened the second seal, I heard the second
                    living creature say, 'Come!' And out came another horse,
                    bright red; its rider was permitted to take peace from the
                    earth, so that men should slay one another; and he was
                    given a great sword." Rev. 6:3, 4, RSV.

                       Historical: This period of church history corresponds to the
                    church of Smyrna or the period of pagan persecution (about
                    A.D. 100-313).
                        The overall attitude of Rome toward Christ and His followers,
                    though punctuated by tolerance, can be best summed up by
                    the persecution under Diocletian (A.D. 284-305). "He, like
                    Decius and Aurelius before him, felt that Christianity was a
                    menace and that the State must either destroy or yield to it,
                    and in consequence instituted the most ruthless persecution."
                    —SDA Bible Student's Source Book, page 729.
                        "In vain were Satan's efforts to destroy the church of Christ
                    by violence. ... 'The blood of Christians is seed.' "—The Story
                    of Redemption, page 321.
                        General: "Satan was 'a murderer from the beginning' (John
                    8:44); and as soon as he had obtained power over the human
                    race, he not only prompted them to hate and slay one another,
                    but, the more boldly to defy the authority of God, he made the
                    violation of the sixth commandment a part of their religion."
                    —Patriarchs and Prophets, page 337.
                        "While men are ignorant of his devices, this vigilant foe
                     [Satan] is upon their track every moment. He is intruding his
                    presence in every department of the household, in every street
                    of our cities, in the churches, in the national councils, in the
                     courts of justice, perplexing, deceiving, seducing, everywhere
                     ruining the souls and bodies of men, women, and children,
                     breaking up families, sowing hatred, emulation, strife, sedition,
                     murder. And the Christian world seem to regard these things as
                     though God had appointed them and they must exist."—The
                    Great Controversy, page 508.
                        "Satan delights in war, for it excites the worst passions of

           Part 3       What did the third rider hold in his hand?
 THE BLACK HORSE
                        "And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third
                     beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse;
                     and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand.
                     And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A
                     measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley
                     for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine."
                     Rev. 6:5, 6.

                         Historical: "This symbol may be thought of as characterizing
                     the spiritual condition within the church after the legalization
                     of Christianity in the 4th century, when church and state were
                     united. Following this union much of the concern of the church
                     was with secular matters, and in many instances a dearth of
                     spirituality ensued."—SDA Bible Commentary, on Rev. 6:5.
                         The period usually considered to be represented by the
                     black horse is A.D. 313-538.
                         General: "These balances may also be interpreted as a
                     symbol of undue concern for the material necessities of life.
                     No longer does warfare result in victory, as with the first horse-
                     man . . . , or represent largely bloodshed, as with the second
                     . . . , but now an even more dreaded result has followed—
                     famine."—SDA Bible Commentary, on Rev. 6:5.
                         "He [Satan] sweeps away the ripening harvest, and famine
                     and distress follow. He imparts to the air a deadly taint, and
                     thousands perish by the pestilence. These visitations are to
                     become more and more frequent and disastrous."—The Great

           Part 4      What was the name of the rider of the fourth horse?
  THE PALE HORSE       "When he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the
                    fourth living creature say, 'Come!' And I saw, and behold, a
                    pale horse, and its rider's name was Death, and Hades fol-
                    lowed him; and they were given power over a fourth of the
                    earth, to kill with sword and with famine and with pestilence
                    and by wild beasts of the earth." Rev. 6:7, 8, RSV.
                        Historical: Compromise by the church with heathen prac-
                    tices and philosophies led to such ambitions as changing the
                    law of God and usurping God's very sovereignty. Once these
                    ambitions were defended by church fathers such as Augustine,
                    many of the popes used them to execute judgment upon both
                    men and nations. Popery had become the world's despot—not
                    only a church but a political machine. See The Great Con-
                    troversy, pages 55-60. What Satan did not achieve by force,
                    he appears to have achieved by stealth. He had planted his
                    seat in the church. See Rev. 13:2. Paleness is the result of
                    those that have erred both in spirit and in doctrine. See Isa.
                    29:22-24. The thousand years of this era are a mute but un-
                    deniable testimony to a Christianity alien to the Spirit of
                    Christ and to the corruption of doctrine by a multitude of
                    priestly inventions and political expediencies. See SDA Bible
                    Commentary, Vol. 7, pp. 25-39.
                        This period extended from about 538-1517, the period of
                    the church of Thyatira.
                        General: "Evil, sin, and death were not created by God; they
                     are the result of disobedience, which originated in Satan."—
                    Testimonies, Vol. 5, p. 503.
                        "God is the life-giver. From the beginning all His laws were
                     ordained to life. But sin broke in upon the order that God had
                     established, and discord followed. So long as sin exists, suffer-
                     ing and death are inevitable. It is only because the Redeemer
                     has borne the curse of sin in our behalf that man can hope to
                     escape, in his own person, its dire results."—Patriarchs and
                    Prophets, page 522.
                        "Satan works through the elements also to garner his har-
                     vest of unprepared souls. He has studied the secrets of the
                     laboratories of nature, and he uses all his power to control the

A Preview of Judgment         LESSON 8                                    Thursday
                                                                            May 23

            Part 5        What persons were central to the picture that appeared
      THE MARTYRS    when the sixth seal was opened?
                          "And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the
                     altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God,
                     and for the testimony which they held." Rev. 6:9.
                         Historical: "It appears that the symbolization of the fifth
                     seal was presented to encourage those who faced martyrdom
                     and death, with the assurance that despite the seeming triumph
                     of the enemy, vindication would ultimately come. Such an en-
                     couragement would be particularly heartening for those living
                     in the time of the terrible persecutions of the later Middle
                     Ages, but more especially during the time of the Reformation
                     and after. . . . To them, it must have seemed that the long
                     period of oppression would never end. The message of the
                     fifth seal was a reassurance that the cause of God would ulti-
                     mately triumph. The same encouragement will come to those
                     passing through the last great conflict (see 5T 451)."—SDA
                     Bible Commentary, on Rev. 6:9.
                         General: The crying souls are symbolic of man's injustice
                     and his inhumanity to man. "And the Lord said unto Cain,
                     Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my
                     brother's keeper? And he said, What hast thou done? the
                     voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground."
                     Gen. 4:9, 10. "The mangled forms of millions of martyrs cried
                     to God for vengeance."—The Great Controversy, pages 59,
                     60. God does hear, and there is a limit to divine patience. See
                     Ex. 3:7, 8.
                         The little season continues until the end of time. Others
                     must join the cry of distress before God's forbearance with
                     the world is ended. "The people of God will then be plunged
                     into those scenes of affliction and distress which prophets have
                     described as the time of Jacob's trouble. The cries of the faith-

                         "The cruelties heaped upon the follower of Jesus are in-
                     stigated by Satan and his hosts because they cannot force
                     him to submit to their control. It is the rage of a vanquished
                     foe. Every martyr of Jesus has died a conqueror."—Patriarchs

            Part 6      Enumerate the events disclosed at the opening of the
      THE COMING     sixth seal. Rev. 6:12-17.
         OF JESUS
                         The language here changes from symbolic to literal.
                         "In fulfillment of this prophecy there occurred, in the year
                     1755, the most terrible earthquake that has ever been recorded.
                     Though commonly known as the earthquake of Lisbon, it ex-
                     tended to the greater part of Europe, Africa, and America. It
                     was felt in Greenland, in the West Indies, in the island of
                     Madeira, in Norway and Sweden, Great Britain and Ireland. It
                     pervaded an extent of not less than four million square miles.
                     In Africa the shock was almost as severe as in Europe."—The
                     Great Controversy, page 304.
                         The period covered by the events of the sixth seal is from
                     1755 to the second advent of Jesus.
                         The text makes no reference to the conduct of the righteous
                     at the second advent; reference is made only to the wicked.
                     Under the fifth seal martyrs did not ask anything about their own
                     reward, but they asked when justice would be carried out in
                     relation to those who killed them. This emphasis on the lost
                     harmonizes with the overall purpose of the seals—the presenta-
                     tion of evidence to convict the lost and to vindicate God in
                     dealing with them.
                         In the context of the seals the presentation of the signs of
                     earthquake, darkness, and falling stars is really to say that in
                     the judgment the wicked will see that they had opportunity to
                     know that Jesus was coming soon, and that then they will see
                     how they reacted in fear and consternation at His advent.
                           Ellen White describes Satan's experience in the last judg-
                     ment:
                          "Satan seems paralyzed as he beholds the glory and majesty
                     of Christ....
                          "He reviews his work among men and its results—the enmity
                      of man toward his fellow man, the terrible destruction of life,
                      the rise and fall of kingdoms, the overturning of thrones, the
                      long succession of tumults, conflicts, and revolutions. He re-
                      calls his constant efforts to oppose the work of Christ and to
                      sink man lower and lower. He sees that his hellish plots have
                      been powerless to destroy those who have put their trust in
                      Jesus. As Satan looks upon his kingdom, the fruit of his toil,
                      he sees only failure and ruin."—The Great Controversy, page

                                        May 26 to June I


"And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest.
And he said to me,
These are they which came out of great
tribulation, and have washed their robes,
and made them white
in the blood of the Lamb." Rev. 7:14.

    In the opening of the six seals John viewed the evi-
dence that will condemn the lost sinners. In verse 16 of
chapter 6 the lost sinners appeal to be hid from the
Lamb's presence. By their own admission they do not
belong where the Lamb is.
    When the lost ask, "Who shall be able to stand?"
the question carries a note of despair. When Jesus ap-
pears, the lost sinners will be overwhelmed, and the
question indicates that this event surpasses anything
that they would expect a human being to survive.
    In chapter seven the curtain that hides the activities
of heavenly agencies from the people of this world is
drawn aside, and we see God's protection over the
whole world and His selection of the living persons who
will be inducted into His kingdom of glory..!,
    In the strictest interpretation, chapter seven should
be seen as a view of past events portrayed'` before the
wicked in the judgment, this passage being in the con-
text of the seven seals. Seen in this way, it serves to
show the wicked what God has done in their behalf; it
 shows them the opportunity that they had to be sealed
in the time of the sealing work. To us who read the
passage before completion of the sealing, it has the
 effect of prophecy. When the sealing is completed, this
 passage will continue to be a prophecy of what God
 will reveal to Satan and the lost as evidence that He
 has dealt fairly with them.

           Part 1       What did John see angels doing?
 THE FOUR ANGELS
                        "And after these things I saw four angels standing on the
                     four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth,
                     that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea,
                     nor on any tree." Rev. 7:1..

                        These first verses are part of God's answer to the question
                     of the wicked host concerning who could survive. God has
                     protected them during their life on earth. Survival in a wicked
                     world was due only to God's intervention, and human survival
                     of the advent will also be His act. His protection of the world
                     has been extended in time so that more persons could be ready
                     for the advent, and now those who ask the question have
                     spurned the added opportunity to prepare for it.

                     51:1, 2, 11.

                         "John sees the elements of nature—earthquake, tempest,
                     and political strife—represented as being held by four angels.
                     These winds are under control until God gives the word to let
                     them go. There is the safety of God's church. The angels of
                     God do His bidding, holding back the winds of the earth, that
                     the winds should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor
                     on any tree, until the servants of God should be sealed in their
                     foreheads. . . . It is the voice of this highest angel that had
                     authority to command the four angels to keep in check the
                     four winds until this work was performed, and until he should
                     give the summons to let them loose."—Testimonies to Min-

                         "Oh, how few know the time of the visitation! How few, even
                     among those who claim to believe present truth, understand
                      the signs of the times or what we are to experience before the
                      end! We are today under divine forbearance; but how long will
                      the angels of God continue to hold the winds, that they shall
                     not blow?"—Testimonies, Vol. 6, p. 426.
                          "Everything in the world is in an unsettled state. . . . But
                      although the nations are mustering their forces for war and
                      bloodshed, the command to the angels is still in force, that

                                                                          May 27

            Part 2      What was the message of the sealing angel to the four
THE SEALING ANGEL    angels?
                        "And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having
                     the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to
                     the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and
                     the sea, saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the
                     trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their
                     foreheads." Rev. 7:2, 3.

                         It is for a spiritual reason, the sealing, that the powers of
                     evil are restrained in this world.
                         Today signatures have largely replaced seals. When one
                     signs a letter, he identifies himself as the writer of the letter.
                     When he signs a document, he gives approval to its contents.
                     When God's seal is placed on a person, it may be viewed as
                     representing both authorship and approval. God has remade
                     the person, and He is satisfied with the work.
                         "The Israelites placed over their doors a signature of blood,
                     to show that they were God's property. So the children of God
                     in this age will bear the signature God has appointed. They
                     will place themselves in harmony with God's holy law."—Ellen

                          "Just as soon as the people of God are sealed in their fore-
                     heads—it is not any seal or mark that can be seen, but a set-
                     tling into the truth, both intellectually and spiritually, so they
                     cannot be moved—just as soon as God's people are sealed
                     and prepared for the shaking, it will come."—Ellen G. White
                     Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 4, p. 1161.
                         "Those who would have the seal of God in their foreheads
                     must keep the Sabbath of the fourth commandment. This is
                      what distinguishes them from the disloyal, who have accepted
                     a man-made institution in the place of the true Sabbath. . . .
                          "As wax takes the impression of the seal, so the soul is to
                     take the impression of the Spirit of God and retain the image
                      of Christ."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary,
                     Vol. 7, p. 970.
                          The seal of God is to be placed in the forehead, indicating
                      approval of the mind of the saved person. The frontal lobe of
                      the brain is man's seat of intelligence, and his brain nerves
                      are the only medium through which Heaven can communicate.

                                                                               May 28

            Part 3      "And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and
       THE 144,000   there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand
                     of all the tribes of the children of Israel." Rev. 7:4.

                         "When men pick up this theory and that theory, when they
                     are curious to know something that it is not necessary for them
                     to know, God is not leading them. It is not His plan that His
                     people shall present something which they have to suppose,
                     which is not taught in the Word. It is not His will that they shall
                     get into controversy over questions which will not help them
                     spiritually, such as, Who is to compose the hundred and forty-
                     four thousand. This those who are the elect of God will in a
                     short time know without question."—Ellen G. White Comments,
                     SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 7, p. 978.
                          The 144,000 have three outstanding characteristics which
                     can be determined from the Bible without speculation.
                         1. They are totally committed to Christ. Rev. 14:1; Gal. 2:20.
                         2. They strive wholly to reveal Him. Rev. 14:5; Phil. 3:13, 14.
                         3. They have achieved victory. Rev. 14:3; 2 Tim. 4:7, 8.
                         "Let us strive with all the power that God has given us to
                     be among the hundred and forty-four thousand."—Ellen G.
                     White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 7, p. 970.
                         "These Israelites thus sealed are then to be understood as
                     belonging to spiritual Israel, the Christian church (see Rom.
                     2:28, 29; 9:6, 7; Gal. 3:28, 29; 6:16; cf. Gal. 4:28; 1 Peter
                     1:1; . . . ). Spiritual Israel, in Bible figure, is represented as
                     also being divided into 12 tribes, for the 12 gates of the New
                     Jerusalem have engraved upon them the names of the 12
                     tribes of Israel."—SDA Bible Commentary, on Rev. 7:4.

                        What type of prayer-life characterizes those to be sealed?
                     Ezek. 9:4-6.

                        "Are we seeking for his fullness, ever pressing toward the
                     mark set before us—the perfection of his character? When
                     the Lord's people reach this mark, they will be sealed in their
                     foreheads. Filled with the Spirit, they will be complete in Christ,
                     and the recording angel will declare, 'It is finished.' "—Ellen
                     G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, Vol. 6, p. 1118.

 THINK IT THROUGH       "While we cannot claim perfection of the flesh, we may
                     have Christian perfection of the soul. Through the sacrifice
                     made in our behalf, sins may be perfectly forgiven. Our de-
                     pendence is not in what man can do; it is in what God can
                     do for man through Christ."—Selected Messages, Bk. 2, p. 32.

To Survive or Not LESSON 9                                         ❑ Wednesday
                                                                        May 29

          Part 4       There have been several views of how the 144,000 are re-
      THE GREAT     lated to the great multitude. Seventh-day Adventists have
                    generally held that they are two distinct groups. It is also
      MULTITUDE     possible to see the entire chapter as a description of the
                    144,000. See Counsels to Teachers, page 532, where those who
                    are "sealed" (the 144,000) are equated with the great multitude.
                    However, the main purpose of the passage presenting the great
                    multitude is given in the shout of the group in verse 10. Pre-
                    cise identification of the multitude is not necessary to under-
                    standing the message in its bold features.
                       What were the descriptive marks of the multitude as John
                    saw them? Rev. 7:9.
                       "The psalms signify that they have gained the victory, and
                    the white robes that they have been clothed with the righ-
                    teousness of Christ. Thank God that a fountain has been
                    opened to wash our robes of character, and make them as
                    white as snow."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Com-
                    mentary, Vol. 7, p. 970.
                       What message did the multitude shout? Verse 10.
                       Contrast this shout with the shout of the lost in Revelation
                    6:16. What is the lesson?
                        "In these scriptures [Rev. 6:12-17 and Rev. 7:9-17] two
                    parties are brought to view. One party permitted themselves
                    to be deceived and took sides with those with whom the Lord
                    has a controversy. They misinterpreted the messages sent
                    them and clothed themselves in robes of self-righteousness.
                    Sin was not sinful in their eyes. They taught falsehood as truth,
                    and by them many souls were led astray.
                        "We need now to take heed to ourselves. . . . Probation
                    still lingers, and it is our privilege to lay hold of the hope set
                    before us in the gospel. Let us repent and be converted and
                    forsake our sins, that they may be blotted out."—Testimonies,
                    Vol. 9, p. 268.
                       What was the response of the angels to the shout in verse
                    10? Verses 11, 12.

 THINK IT THROUGH      What lesson is there in verse 10 for me in this present life?
                       "So by sin, man lost his connection with God. Of himself
                    he has no means of salvation. But in Christ we are brought
                    nigh unto the Father. The elect of God are dear to His heart.
                    They are those whom He has called out of darkness into His
                    marvelous light, to show forth His praise, to shine as lights

             Part 5      What two additional marks of identity of the multitude
      ELDER'S SONG    were given by an elder?
                         "And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What
                      are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence
                      came they? And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he
                      said to me, These are they which came out of great tribula-
                      tion, and have washed their robes, and made them white in
                      the blood of the Lamb." Rev. 7:13, 14.
                          "The white-robed ones who surround the throne of God are
                      not composed of that company who were lovers of pleasures
                      more than lovers of God, and who choose to drift with the
                      current rather than to breast the waves of opposition. All who

                      vailing at this time will have stern conflicts. They will come

                          "This is our washing and ironing time—the time when we
                      are to cleanse our robes of character in the blood of the Lamb.
                      John says, 'Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the
                      sin of the world.' . . . Shall we not let Him take them away?

                      Verses 14, 15. (Note "therefore.")
                          "The conflict is over. All tribulation and strife are at an
                      end. Songs of victory fill all heaven, as the redeemed stand
                      around the throne of God. All take up the joyful strain, 'Worthy

To Survive or Not LESSON 9                                                Friday
                                                                          May 31

           Part 6     What happened when the seventh seal was opened?
         SILENCE      "And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was
                  silence in heaven about the space of half an hour." Rev. 8:1.
                      In John's vision of chapters 4 to 7 heaven reverberated with
                  sound. This medley of sound was followed by silence. John
                  had seen the advent when the sixth seal was opened. He also
                  had seen the redeemed in God's presence. The next events
                  were covered by silence.
                      Ellen White wrote of a time of silence in heaven when Jesus
                  suffered in Gethsemane.
                      "God suffered with His Son. Angels beheld the Saviour's
                  agony. They saw their Lord enclosed by legions of satanic
                  forces, His nature weighed down with a shuddering, mysterious
                  dread. There was silence in heaven. No harp was touched.
                  Could mortals have viewed the amazement of the angelic host
                  as in silent grief they watched the Father separating His beams
                  of light, love, and glory from His beloved Son, they would better
                  understand how offensive in His sight is sin."—The Desire of
                  Ages, page 693.
                      Jesus experienced the anguish of the lost sinner. it is rea-
                  sonable to infer that there would again be silence in heaven
                  when lost sinners shall suffer the consequences of their lives
                  of sin.
                      The rest of the universe cannot appropriately sing and
                  praise at a time that the wicked struggle with the recognition
                  of their guilt and succumb to oblivion.
                      The wicked host themselves will also be silent, just as the
                   man without a wedding garment was speechless.
                       "The whole wicked world stand arraigned at the bar of God
                  on the charge of high treason against the government of
                   heaven. They have none to plead their cause; they are without
                   excuse; and the sentence of eternal death is pronounced
                   against them."—The Great Controversy, page 668.
                       `'Satan sees that his voluntary rebellion has unfitted him
                   for heaven. He has trained his powers to war against God; the
                   purity, peace, and harmony of heaven would be to him supreme
                   torture. His accusations against the mercy and justice of God
                   are now silenced."—The Great Controversy, page 670.
 THINK IT THROUGH       How can I more fully understand the true nature of sin
                   and learn to hate it?
                       "That pierced side whence flowed the crimson stream that
                   reconciled man to God—there is the Saviour's glory, there
                   'the hiding of His power.' Mighty to save,' through the sacrifice
                   of redemption, He was therefore strong to execute justice
                   upon them that despised God's mercy."—The Great Contro-

   Adventists hiave recorded views of the trumpets in various publications.
However, there has been quite a general feeling that the prophecy of the
trumpets was Still not well understood; it is felt that even if these symbols
have been correctly interpreted, these interpretations do not seem to hold
much relevancy for the twentieth century.
    It is therefore with some hesitancy that we provide lessons on the
trumpets. This hesitancy is increased by the complete lack of spirit of
prophecy comment on verses 5-13 in Revelation 8 and a single reference
to chapter 9. Considerations of certainty of interpretation and relevancy
to the present have been guides in the preparation of these lessons. The
first six trumpets will be studied in rapid sequence, noting briefly the
historical Seventh-day Adventist interpretation.
    The introduction (Rev. 8:3, 4) and the seventh trumpet are clear and
relevant, and it is on these two passages that most emphasis is placed
in the lessons.
    Seventh-day Adventists have usually viewed the prophecies of the
seven churches, the seven seals, and the seven trumpets as three parallel
prophecies with differing emphases. This is similar to our view of three
parallel prophecies in the second, seventh, and eighth chapters of Daniel.
     From the earliest times the trumpet has been associated with armies
and war. The trumpet signals the start of the day, gives the signal to
attack, and adds a somber note when military heroes are laid in their
graves.
     Under the symbol of the first four trumpets we see depicted the main
 incursions that led to the collapse of Roman government in the western
 sector. The next two trumpets discuss the main forces involved in the
 overthrow of the eastern sector of the empire, and the last trumpet, the
 seventh, signals the overthrow of all earthly powers and the establish-
 ment of God's eternal empire of peace.

            Part 1      What was given to each of seven angels? How were the
         TRUMPETS    angels identified?

                        "And I saw the seven angels which stood before God;
                     and to them were given seven trumpets." Rev. 8:2.

                        On what occasion were seven trumpets used by Israel?
                     Joshua 6:4, 5.

                        By the plan of marching and blowing trumpets "it was to
                     be impressed upon their minds that their strength was not in
                     the wisdom of man, nor in his might, but only in the God of
                     their salvation. They were thus to become accustomed to re-
                     lying wholly upon their divine Leader."—Patriarchs and Proph-
                     ets, page 493.
                        On what other occasion were trumpets an important fea-
                     ture of attack on God's enemies? Judges 7:16-18.

                         "The simple act of blowing a blast upon the trumpet by the
                     army of Joshua around Jericho, and by Gideon's little band
                     about the hosts of Midian, was made effectual, through the
                     power of God, to overthrow the might of His enemies."—Pa-
                     triarchs and Prophets, page 554.
                         In the prophecy the heavenly trumpeters successively sig-
                     naled the beginning of seven specific destructive events on
                     earth. They are not pictured as causing the events, but as
                     keeping them under control so that each event does not occur
                     until the heavenly trumpeter signals it.
                         "In the annals of human history the growth of nations, the
                     rise and fall of empires, appear as dependent on the will and
                     prowess of man. The shaping of events seems, to a great de-
                     gree, to be determined by his power, ambition, or caprice. But
                     in the word of God the curtain is drawn aside, and we behold,
                     behind, above, and through all the play and counterplay of
                     human interests and power and passions, the agencies of the
                     all-merciful One, silently, patiently working out the counsels
                     of His own will."—Education, page 173.
                         "Prophecy has traced the rise and fall of the world's great

           Part 2      What scene did John view before the angels blew the
         INCENSE    trumpets?
                       "And another angel came and stood at the altar, having
                    a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense,
                    that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the
                    golden altar which was before the throne. And the smoke
                    of the incense, which came with the prayers of the saints,
                    ascended up before God out of the angel's hand." Rev. 8:3, 4.
                       "The religious services, the prayers, the praise, the penitent
                    confession of sin ascend from true believers as incense to the
                    heavenly sanctuary, but passing through the corrupt channels
                    of humanity, they are so defiled that unless purified by blood,
                    they can never be of value with God. They ascend not in
                    spotless purity, and unless the Intercessor, who is at God's
                    right hand, presents and purifies all by His righteousness, it
                    is not acceptable to God. All incense from earthly tabernacles
                    must be moist with the cleansing drops of the blood of Christ.
                    He holds before the Father the censer of his own merits, in
                    which there is no taint of earthly corruption. He gathers into
                    this censer the prayers, the praise, and the confessions of His
                    people, and with these He puts His own spotless righteousness.
                    Then, perfumed with the merits of Christ's propitiation, the
                    incense comes up before God wholly and entirely acceptable.
                    Then gracious answers are returned.
                        "Oh, that all may see that everything in obedience, in peni-
                    tence, in praise and thanksgiving, must be placed upon the
                    glowing fire of the righteousness of Christ. The fragrance of
                    this righteousness ascends like a cloud around the mercy
                    seat."—Selected Messages, Bk. 1, p. 344.
 THINK IT THROUGH      "Morning and evening the heavenly universe behold every
                    household that prays, and the angel with the incense, repre-
                    senting the blood of the atonement, finds access to God."—

                    971
                        "As the high priest sprinkled the warm blood upon the
                    mercy seat while the fragrant cloud of incense ascended be-
                    fore God, so, while we confess our sins and plead the efficacy
                    of Christ's atoning blood, our prayers are to ascend to heaven,
                    fragrant with the merits of our Saviour's character. Notwith-
                    standing our unworthiness, we are to remember that there is
                    One who can take away sin, and who is willing and anxious to
                    save the sinner. With His own blood He paid the penalty for
                    all wrongdoers. Every sin acknowledged before God with a
                    contrite heart, He will remove."—Ellen G. White Comments,

            Part 3      What did the angel do with the censer?
           CENSER
                        "And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the
                     alter, and cast it into the earth: and there were voices, and
                     thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake." Rev. 8:5.

                        The righteousness of Jesus contains both the mercy and
                     the justice of God. In this symbol His righteousness is seen
                     moving in two directions corresponding to His mercy and jus-
                     tice. It ascends with the prayers of the saints from earth to
                     heaven, and descends from heaven to earth in the judgments
                     of God. As the Lamb could open the scroll because He was
                     slain and had redeemed men, so in this symbol of the censer
                     there is a heavenly intervention in earth, and earthly access
                     to heaven, as a result of the atonement. God deals graciously
                     with the praying saints, but the earth is smitten with His
                     judgments. See John 3:16-18. These judgments are not limited
                     to the seven last plagues, but culminate in them.
                         A supernatural display of voices, thunderings, lightnings and
                     earthquakes is connected with three awesome moments in Bible
                     history: (1) God's visit to Sinai (Ex. 19:16-18); (2) Christ's
                     crucifixion (Matt. 27:51; Early Writings, page 253); and (3) His
                     Second Coming (Rev. 11:19; 16:18, Heb. 12:26).
                         Of the crucifixion Ellen White wrote: "Priests and rulers look
                     toward Jerusalem; and lo, the dense cloud has settled upon
                     the city, and over Judah's plains, and the fierce lightnings of
                     God's wrath are directed against the fated city. Suddenly the
                     gloom is lifted from the cross, and in clear trumpet tones, that
                     seem to resound throughout creation, Jesus cries, 'It is fin-
                     ished:"Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit.' A light
                     encircled the cross, and the face of the Saviour shone with a
                     glory like unto the sun. He then bowed his head upon his
                     breast, and died.
                         "All the spectators stood paralyzed, and with bated breath
                     gazed upon the Saviour. Again darkness settled upon the face
                     of the earth, and a hoarse rumbling like heavy thunder was
                     heard. This was accompanied by a violent trembling of the
                     earth."—Spirit of Prophecy, Vol. 3, p. 166.

THINK IT THROUGH        The atonement makes Jesus both "mighty to save" and the
                     proclaimer of the day of vengeance. See Isa. 61:2; 63:1.

                        "See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they
                     escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more
                     shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh
                     from heaven." Heb. 12:25.

                       When Roitne under Pilate crucified Christ, she signed her
                    own death warrant. See Prophets and Kings page 535. In these
                    pronouncements of judgment on the Roman Empire we have an
                    overview of the years that culminated in the collapse of the
                    empire under the onslaught of heathen hordes.
                       Hail symbolizes God's judgments. Job 38:22, 23; Isa. 28:16,
                    17; Rev. 16:21. Fire and blood typify his wrath. Rev. 14:19, 20;
                    19:11-13. These were cast upon the earth, meaning literal
                    judgments on men and nations (Rev. 16:2), particularly the
                    Roman Empire.
                       "The earth, with its vegetation, is shown as the particular
                    target of this scourge (cf. ch. 16:2). The scourge is singularly
                    descriptive of the invasion of the Roman Empire by the Visi-
                    goths under Alaric. This was the first of the Teutonic incursions
                    into the Roman Empire that played such an important part in
                    its final downfall. Beginning about A.D. 396, the Visigoths
                    overran Thrace, Macedonia, and Greece in the eastern part
                    of the empire, and then crossed the Alps and pillaged the city
                    of Rome in A.D. 410. They also ravaged much of what is now
                    France and ultimately settled in Spain."—SDA Bible Commen-

                       What scene appeared at the sounding of the second trum-
                    pet? Rev. 8:8, 9.

                       "At this time [c. A.D. 365], as if trumpets were sounding
                    the war-note throughout the whole Roman world, the most
                    savage peoples aroused themselves and poured across the
                    nearest frontiers."—SDA Bible Students' Source Book, page
                    836.
                       "The catastrophe announced by the second trumpet has
                    been seen as describing the depredations of the Vandals.
                    Driven from their settlements in Thrace by the incursions of
                    the Huns from Central Asia, the Vandals migrated through
                    Gaul (now France) and Spain into Roman North Africa and
                    established a kingdom centering around Carthage. From there
                    they dominated the western Mediterranean with a navy of
                    pirates.—SDA Bible Commentary, on Rev. 8:8.

          TRUMPETS
     THREE AND FOUR        "And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star
                       from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the
                       third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters; and
                       the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part
                       of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the
                       waters, because they were made bitter." Rev. 8:10, 11.


                           "This has been interpreted as portraying the invasion and
                       ravages of the Huns under the leadership of their king Attila,
                       in the 5th century. Entering Europe from Central Asia about
                       A.D. 372, the Huns first settled along the lower Danube. Three
                       quarters of a century later they were on the move again, and
                       for a brief period raised havoc in various regions of the totter-
                       ing Roman Empire. Crossing the Rhine in A.D. 451, they were
                       stopped by combined Roman and German troops at Chalons
                       in northern Gaul. After a short period of marauding in Italy,
                       Attila died in A.D. 453, and almost immediately the Huns dis-
                       appeared from history. In spite of the short period of their
                       ascendancy, so rapacious were the Huns in their devastations
                       that their name has come down through history as synonymous
                       with the worst slaughter and destruction."—SDA Bible Com-
                       mentary, on Rev. 8:10.

                          What scene appeared at the sound of the fourth trumpet?
                       Rev. 8:12.


                           The sun. "The sun, moon, and stars have been interpreted to
                       represent the great luminaries of the Western Roman govern-
                       ment—its emperors, senators, and consuls. With the extinction
                       of western Rome in k D. 476... the last of its emperors ceased
                       to reign. Later, its senate and consulship came to an end.
                           "Shone not for a third part. The thought seems to be that
                       these bodies would be smitten during one third of the time of
                       their shining, not that one third of the bodies themselves would
                       be smitten so that they would shine with two-thirds brilliance.
                       Thus one third of the day and one third of the night would be
                       dark. Applied to the divisions of the Roman government, the
                       figure may describe the successive extinction of the emperors,
                       senators, and consuls."—SDA Bible Commentary, on Rev. 8:12.

          Part 6     Read Revelation 9:1-11.
       TRUMPETS
    FIVE AND SIX     The fifth and sixth trumpets open two more amazing chap-
                 ters of prophecy. Although Ellen White makes no reference to
                 the first four trumpets, she does make an extended comment
                 on the fifth and sixth, quoting the words of Josiah Litch from
                 an edition of Signs of the Times in 1840. See Further Study
                 reference.
                     Western Rome fell under military attack. Eastern Rome fell
                 under the religio-military onslaught of the Moslems. The reli-
                 gion of Islam penetrated in the East like "the smoke of a great
                 furnace," gaining so many converts that they are compared
                 with a plague of grasshoppers.
                      Moslem influence on Christianity was as deadly as the sting
                 of a scorpion. But, according to the prophecy these religious
                 zealots would harass the church for a specific period. It was
                 to be five prophetic months-150 literal years. Othman I led
                 the invasion of Eastern Rome on July 27, 1299. The 150 years
                  of the fifth trumpet.ended on July 27, 1449.
                      The sixth trumpet describes the time when the Turks—allies
                 of the Arabs—gained supremacy in the East. Just four years
                 after the commencement of the sixth trumpet, Eastern Rome
                  collapsed when the Turkish Sultan Mohammed II captured
                  Constantinople. Then began a further chapter of oppression
                  of the Christians.
                      The time of the sixth trumpet is designated as an hour, a
                  day, a month, and a year. Verses 14, 15. In literal time this
                  would be 360 years, 30 years, 1 year, and 1/24th of a year or
                  15 days, a total of 391 years 15 days. As the fifth trumpet
                  ended July 27, 1449, the sixth trumpet would end August 11,
                  1840. If the sixth trumpet reveals the time of the supremacy
                  of the Turks, then the end of the sixth trumpet would reveal
                  the end of that supremacy. Josiah Litch and others saw this
                  clearly and predicted that Turkey's doom would be settled on
                  or by August 11, 1840. Ultimately the Turkish Sultan formally
                  placed Turkey in the hands of the ambassadors of the Chris-
                  tian nations—England, Austria, Russia, and Prussia. The date
                  of the declaration—August 11, 1840! Let Ellen White comment
                  further:
                      "At the very time specified, Turkey, through her ambassa-
                  dors, accepted the protection of the allied powers of Europe,
                  and thus placed herself under the control of Christian nations.
                  The event exactly fulfilled the prediction. . .. When it became
                  known, multitudes were convinced of the correctness of the
                  principles of prophetic interpretation adopted by Miller and
                  his associates, and a wonderful impetus was given to the ad-
                  vent movement."—The Great Controversy, page 335.

"The testing truth for this time is not
the fabrication of any human mind.
It is from God. It is genuine philosophy
to those who appropriate it. Christ
became incarnate in order that we,
through belief of the truth, might be
sanctified and redeemed. Let those
who hold the truth in righteousness
arouse and go forth, shod with the
preparation of the gospel of peace, to
proclaim the truth to those who know
it not."—"Testimonies," Vol. 8, pp. 211,
212.
    Chapter ten is a detour in the se-
quence of the seven trumpets. It follows
the sixth trumpet (as the interlude on
the sealing followed the opening of the
sixth seal). In each case the detour was
delayed in the prophetic sequence as
long as possible. To have delayed it
until after the fulfillment of one more
seal or one more trumpet would have
placed the content of the interlude
outside the scope of the prophecy. It
has been placed precisely where it
belongs. That these detours occur only
after the sixth element of these proph-
ecies indicates a special concern for
events that are closely related in time
and subject to the second coming of
Jesus.
    In the first chapter of Revelation
Jesus was seen in heaven among the
 churches. Here in chapter ten He is
 seen standing on earth and communica-
 ting details about His church of the last
 days. The first vision emphasizes
 Christ's work in behalf of the churches,
 where this vision emphasizes the work
 of the church in cooperation with Jesus.
    The message comes to us in these
 two visions that Jesus, in a very real
 way, is the true leader of the church.
 His instructions have come to the church
 through the testimony of Jesus.
    The church, composed of human be-
 ings, is not a merely human institution.
 Men may do the work of the church, but
 these human workers are obligated to
 follow the directives given to the church
 by its divine Leader, Jesus Christ.

            Part 1      What description did John give of the angel he saw?
 THE MIGHTY ANGEL
                        "And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven,
                     clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow was upon his head, and
                     his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire:
                     and he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his right
                     foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the earth." Rev. 10:1, 2.

                         "The mighty angel who instructed John was no less a per-
                     sonage than Jesus Christ."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA
                     Bible Commentary, Vol. 7, p. 971. The rainbow is symbolic of
                     God's covenant with man (Gen. 9:13) which covenant is His
                     glory (Ezek. 1:26-28). The description of Christ's person is
                      similar to the descriptions of His transfiguration and His appear-
                     ance to John at the beginning of the book of Revelation. "The
                      instruction to be communicated to John was so important that
                     Christ came from heaven to give it to His servant, telling him
                     to send it to the churches."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA
                     Bible Commentary, Vol. 7, pp. 953, 954.
                         "Setting His right foot on the sea, and His left upon the dry
                     land, shows the part which He is acting in the closing scenes
                     of the great controversy with Satan. This position denotes His
                     supreme power and authority over the whole earth. The con-
                     troversy has waxed stronger and more determined from age
                     to age, and will continue to do so, to the concluding scenes
                     when the masterly working of the powers of darkness shall
                     reach their height. Satan, united with evil men, will deceive
                     the whole world and the churches who receive not the love of
                     the truth."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commen-
                     tary, Vol. 7, p. 971.

                        What did the angel have in his hand? Verse 2.

                        This is the book of Daniel_ unsealed, for it is open. "The
                     injunction comes to John as to Daniel in regard to the little
                     book: 'Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered.'
                     These relate to future events which will be disclosed in their
                     order. Daniel shall stand in his lot at the end of the days. John
                     sees the little book unsealed. Then Daniel's prophecies have
                     their proper place in the first, second, and third angels' mes-
                     sages to be given to the world. The unsealing of the little book
                     was the message in relation to time.
                        "The books of Daniel and the Revelation are one. One is a
                     prophecy, the other a revelation; one a book sealed, the other
                     a book opened."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Com-

                    was shown three steps—the first, second, and third angels'
                    messages. Said my accompanying angel, 'Woe to him who shall
                    move a block or stir a pin of these messages. The true under-
                    standing of these messages is of vital importance. The destiny
                    of souls hangs upon the manner in which they are received.'
                    I was again brought down through these messages, and saw
                    how dearly the people of God had purchased their experience.
                    It had been obtained through much suffering and severe con-
                    flict. God had led them along step by step, until He had placed
                    them upon a solid, immovable platform. I saw individuals ap-
                    proach the platform and examine the foundation. Some with
                    rejoicing immediately stepped upon it. Others commenced to
                    find fault with the foundation. They wished improvements made,
                    and then the platform would be more perfect, and the people
                    much happier. Some stepped off the platform to examine it
                    and declared it to be laid wrong. But I saw that nearly all stood
                    firm upon the platform and exhorted those who had stepped
                    off to cease their complaints; for God was the Master Builder,
                    and they were fighting against Him."—Early Writings, page 259.

               Part 3      "And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon
     THE DIVINE OATH    the earth lifted up his hand to heaven, and sware by him
                        that liveth for ever and ever, who created heaven, and the
                        things that therein are, and the earth, and the things that
                        therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein,
                        that there should be time no longer." Rev. 10:5, 6.
                            The lifting up of the angel's hand was accompanied by an
                        oath. It was irrevocable, for it was made in the name of the
                        Creator who liveth forever and ever. There was no greater by
                        which to confirm it. See Heb. 6:13.
                            "This time, which the angel declares with a solemn oath, is
                        not the end of this world's history, neither of probationary
                        time, but of prophetic time, which should precede the advent of
                        our Lord. That is, the people will not have another message
                        upon definite time. After this period of time, reaching from
                        1842 to 1844, there can be no definite tracing of the prophetic
                        time. The longest reckoning reaches to the autumn of 1844."

                        long was it? Daniel 8:14-17.
                            Since the culmination of Daniel's prophecy in 1844 men
                        have been living, in a sense, on borrowed time. We cannot say
                        that time must last for a certain number of years, for the final
                        period of earth is not according to any time-length prophecy.
                        "It was not the will of God that the coming of Christ should
                        be thus delayed."—Evangelism, page 696.
                            "God's unwillingness to have His people perish, has been
                        the reason of so long delay."—Evangelism, page 694.
                            "We may have to remain here in this world because of in-
                        subordination many more years, as did the children of Israel;
                        but for Christ's sake, His people should not add sin to sin by
                        charging God with the consequence of their own wrong course
                        of action....
                            "It is the privilege of every Christian, not only to look for,
                        but to hasten the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Were all
                        who profess His name bearing fruit to His glory, how quickly
                        the whole world would be sown with the seed of the gospel.
                        Quickly the last harvest would be ripened, and Christ would
                        come to gather the precious grain....

                                                                          June 12

            Part 4      "But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when
THE SEVENTH ANGEL    he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be fin-
                     ished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets."
                     Rev. 10:7.

                        Chapter 10 is an interlude and a pause that refreshes the
                     weary spirit of the apostle who has witnessed so much blood-
                     shed across the centuries. Here is sketched before him a
                     preview of the direct intervention of Christ Himself in the final
                     actions of men and nations and the certainty of the divine
                     culmination under the seventh trumpet. See Rev. 11:15-19.
                     It was in 1844 that the seventh angel was to begin to sound
                     and to carry to completion the work of God on earth. This is
                     the last message of mercy to a dying world, a world that soon
                     will have an end. See Matt. 28:20.
                         The word musterion, translated mystery in verse 7, means
                     a secret, but not in the sense that it is not told or in the modern
                     sense that it cannot be understood. It has reference to those
                     who are initiated into a secret rite not understood by those
                     outside. It is the right of the initiated to know all the mysteries
                     beginning with the day of their initiation. These heavenly
                     secrets were given to the prophets to be passed on to those
                     who are the heirs of salvation. See SDA Bible Commentary,
                     Vol. 7, p. 740.
                       What will be the final display of the mysterious power of
                     God? 1 Cor. 15:51, 52.
                        "At the birth of Jesus, Satan knew that One had come with
                     a divine commission to dispute his dominion. He trembled at
                     the angel's message attesting the authority of the newborn
                     King. Satan well knew the position that Christ had held in
                     heaven as the Beloved of the Father. That the Son of God
                     should come to this earth as man filled him with amazement
                     and with apprehension. He could not fathom the mystery of
                     this great sacrifice. His selfish soul could not understand such
                     love for the deceived race."—The Desire of Ages, page 115.
                        "Rich and poor, high and low, free and bond, are God's
                     heritage. He who gave His life to redeem man sees in every
                     human being a value that exceeds finite computation. By the
                     mystery and glory of the cross we are to discern His estimate
                     of the value of the soul. When we do this, we shall feel that
                     human beings, however degraded, have cost too much to be
                     treated with coldness or contempt."—The Ministry of Healing,

                        in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and

                            "In a specific sense the experience that came to John here
                        in vision may be seen as typical of that of the advent believers
                        in the years 1840-1844. When these believers first heard the
                        message of the imminent second coming, it was to them
                        'sweet as honey.' But when Christ did not come as they ex-
                        pected, their experience was indeed bitter."—SDA Bible Com-
                        mentary, on Rev. 10:10.
                            "I saw that Jesus regarded with the deepest compassion the
                        disappointed ones who had waited for His coming; and He
                        sent His angels to direct their minds that they might follow
                        Him where He was. He showed them that this earth is not the
                        sanctuary, but that He must enter the most holy place of the
                        heavenly sanctuary to make an atonement for His people and
                        to receive the kingdom from His Father, and that He would
                        then return to the earth and take them to dwell with Him
                        forever."—Early Writings, page 244.

                           In principle, the experience of the believers in the summer
                        of 1844 is very applicable to us today. "They were closely
                        united and seemed to be wrapped in the light of heaven.
                        Around this company were some who came under the influence
                        of the light, but who were not particularly united to the com-
                        pany. All who cherished the light shed upon them were gazing
                        upward with intense interest, and Jesus looked upon them
                        with sweet approbation. They expected Him to come and
                        longed for His appearing. They did not cast one lingering look
                        to earth. But again a cloud settled upon the waiting ones, and
                        I saw them turn their weary eyes downward. I inquired the
                        cause of this change. Said my accompanying angel, 'They are
                        again disappointed in their expectations. Jesus cannot yet
                        come to earth. They must endure greater trials for His sake.
                        They must give up errors and traditions received from men
                        and turn wholly to God and His Word. They must be purified,
                        made white, and tried. Those who endure that bitter trial will
                        obtain an eternal victory.' "—Early Writings, page 243.

     COMMISSION
                       "Prophesy again" has reference to a task not finished. The
                    witness must be borne until the work is finished. When this is
                    done, Christ will come. See Matt. 24:14.
                       "The angel's position, with one foot on the sea, the other on
                    the land, signifies. the wide extent of the proclamation of the
                    message. It will cross the broad waters and be proclaimed in
                    other countries, even to all the world. The comprehension of
                    truth, the glad reception of the message, is represented in the
                    eating of the little book. ...
                       "The gospel that is to be preached to all nations, kindreds,
                    tongues, and peoples presents the truth in clear lines, showing
                    that obedience is the condition of gaining eternal life. Christ
                    imparts His righteousness to those who consent to let Him take
                    away their sins. We are indebted to Christ for the grace which

                       Our mission service has gradually extended into much of
                    the world. In nearly 200 countries and 1,000 tongues the mes-

                    so. Gottfried Oosterwal notes in his book, Mission Possible,
                    that there have been four distinct phases of Adventist mission
                    expansion:
                       1. To reach the backslidden Adventists (1844-1850's).
                       2. To reach the nations in North America (1850's-1860's).
                       3. Beyond America into all the world (1874-1950's).
                       4. The final phase to compass the globe (1950's-End).
                       "And even still some 90 percent of Adventism's new con-
                    verts come from a Christian background. Only now are Sev-
                    enth-day Adventists beginning to discover that their mission
                    involves salvation first, for every person. Only now are they
                    really beginning to discover the world—the whole world—as
                    the true object of their mission, because the world was the
                    object of God's love and God's own mission."—Gottfried

                                                   June 16-22

                The vision of the mighty angel in chapter 10,
            and the vision of the two witnesses in chapter 11
            correspond to each other. The relationship they
            bear is not chronological, or chapter 11 should
            precede chapter 10. It is a matter of the good
            news preceding the bad news; the positive and
            most important preceding the negative and less
            important.
                In the mighty angel vision, the message of the
            angel is given in a loud voice, the prophetic
            scroll is eaten, and John is bidden to prophesy
            further. In the two witnesses vision, the witnesses
            are in sackcloth, they are slain, remain unburied,
            and after a time are resurrected. Both scenes
            deal with God's messages to the world through
Where       the prophets. In parallel scenes the prophetic
are the     word was seen eaten and slain, shouted and
            silenced. In the first instance the message is
witnesses   brought from heaven; in the second instance the
today?      message ascends to heaven; in the first, Jesus
            is the person related to the message; in the
            second, Satan is the person related to the mes-
            sage. Here then are portrayed Jesus with His
            message and its proclamation by His true follow-
            ers, and the same message opposed by Satan
            and earthly powers under his control.         .>
                The advent movement becomes the ',local
            point, a last-day example of the proclamation of
            the word which has been going on since God
            first spoke to man after the entrance of sin into
            the world.
                 On the other hand, the French revolution then
             becomes a focal point, a last-day example of an
            opposition to the word that has existed in every
            age since the entrance of sin into the world.

             Part 1  What was John instructed to measure and not to measure?
     THE MEASURING   "And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the
               ROD angel stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God,
                     and the altar, and them that worship therein. But the court
                     which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not;
                     for it is given unto the Gentiles: and the holy city shall they
                     tread under foot forty and two months." Rev. 11:1, 2.

                        This rod, given to John to use for measuring, symbolizes
                     judgment. The literal temple represents the plan of redemp-
                     tion. The worshipers are those who claim to have accepted
                     God's redemption. Thus the scene here is symbolic of. the
                     judgment of people in relation to the plan of redemption. "Every
                     case is coming in review before God; He is measuring the
                     temple and the worshipers therein."—Testimonies, Vol. 7, p.

                         In the Jewish economy a definite distinction was made
                     between believers and unbelievers. See Ezek. 44:9. In this
                     measuring the Gentiles are left out, and all those who ever
                     claimed to belong to Christ come under divine scrutiny and
                     the investigative judgment. See Rev. 3:5; 13:8; The Great
                     Controversy, pages 480-483.
                         Forty-two months is three and one-half years of prophetic
                     time or 1260 years of linear time spanning the era of papal
                     supremacy from its inception in A.D. 538 to the reception of
                     the wound, the loss of civil authority, inflicted by the French
                     in 1798.
                         "The grand judgment is taking place, and has been going
                     on for some time. Now the Lord says, Measure the temple and
                     the worshipers thereof. Remember when you are walking the
                     streets about your business, God is measuring you; when you
                     are attending your household duties, when you engage in con-
                     versation, God is measuring you. Remember that your words

            Part 2      What were the witnesses to do, and where did they come
THE TWO WITNESSES    from?
        IDENTIFIED      "And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they
                     shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days,
                     clothed in sackcloth. These are the two olive trees, and the
                     two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth." Rev.
                     11:3,4.

                         "The two witnesses represent the Scriptures of the Old and
                     the New Testament. Both are important testimonies to the
                     origin and perpetuity of the law of God. Both are witnesses also
                     to the plan of salvation. The types, sacrifices, and prophecies
                     of the Old Testament point forward to a Saviour to come. The
                     Gospels and Epistles of the New Testament tell of a Saviour
                     who has come in the exact manner foretold by type and
                     prophecy."—The Great Controversy, page 267.
                         The 1,260 years refer to the time of papal supremacy from
                     its inception to its deadly wound. It corresponds to the "forty
                     and two months" in the previous verse.
                         "During the greater part of this period, God's witnesses re-
                     mained in a state of obscurity. The papal power sought to hide
                     from the people the word of truth, and set before them false
                     witnesses to contradict its testimony. . . . Its testimony was
                     perverted, and every effort made that men and demons could
                     invent to turn the minds of the people from it. . . . Yet they
                      continued their testimony throughout the entire period of 1260
                     years."—The Great Controversy, page 267.
                         The olive trees and candlesticks are additional symbols of
                      the sources of divine power contained in the Word. It is through
                      His Word that we learn how Christ administers the gift of the
                     oil of the Holy Spirit, and through this Word we come into the
                      very presence of God. See Zech. 4:11-14. The candlesticks or
                      lampstands are identified with the olive trees and witnesses
                      and consequently refer to the illumination which is combined
                      in the Scripture and the Holy Spirit.
                          "All who exalt their own opinions above divine revelation,
                      all who would change the plain meaning of Scripture to suit
                      their own convenience, or for the sake of conforming to the
                      world, are taking upon themselves a fearful responsibility. The
                      written word, the law of God, will measure the character of
                      every man and condemn all whom this unerring test shall de-
                      clare wanting."—The Great Controversy, page 268.

              Part 3      What powers did the witnesses possess?
           POWER OF       "And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their
      THE WITNESSES    mouth and devoureth their enemies: and if any man will hurt
                       them, he must in this manner be killed. These have power to
                       shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy: and
                       have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite
                       the earth with all plagues, as often as they will." Rev. 11:5, 6.
                           The reference to power to devour their enemies recalls Old
                       Testament experiences when God's authority was vindicated
                       by the destruction of enemies. Such an experience was that
                       of Moses with Korah and his fellow rebels. See Num. 16:1-35;
                       Ps. 106:16-18. Another, that of Elijah with Ahaziah. See 2 Kings
                       1:3-17.
                          In verse 6 the two allusions are clearly to the experiences
                       of Elijah in the days of Ahab and of Moses in the time of the
                       Exodus. The experiences of Moses and Elijah are drawn upon
                       as men standing for and upon the authority of God and His
                       word. It was these same two men who were sent to substan-
                       tiate the authority of Christ in the eyes of the disciples on the
                       mount of transfiguration as well as give encouragement to
                       Jesus for the trial that lay ahead. See Luke 9:28-36; The Desire
                       of Ages, pages 419-425.
                         How important is the Word of God in our daily lives?
                       Matt. 4:4; 1 Peter 1:23.

                          God's word and His human witnesses are not to be slighted.
                       The truth is not to be treated as of no consequence. The above
                       verses are to impress upon our minds the importance of ulti-
                       mate authority vested in channels of communication chosen
                       and set aside by the God of heaven and earth. These verses
                       also contrast with those to follow by delineating the treatment
                       given to divine authority and heaven-sent communication.
                          "We should reverence God's word. For the printed volume
                       we should show respect, never putting it to common uses, or
                       handling it carelessly. And never should Scripture be quoted
                       in a jest, or paraphrased to point a witty saying. 'Every word
                       of God is pure;' as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified
                       seven times.' ...
                          "Reverence should be shown for God's representatives—
                       for ministers, teachers, and parents who are called to speak
                       and act in His stead. In the respect shown to them He is

           Part 4       What identification was given of the place of the murder
    SLAUGHTER OF    of the witnesses?
   THE WITNESSES       "And when they shall have finished their testimony, the
                    beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make
                    war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.
                    And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city,
                    which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our
                    Lord was crucified." Rev. 11:7, 8.
                        The beast spoken of here is Satan exercising his power
                    through the French Revolution. See Rev. 17:7, 8. He succeeded
                    in ridding the nation for a time of the influence of the two
                    witnesses. "The same master spirit that urged on the St. Bar-
                    tholomew Massacre led also in the scenes of the Revolution."
                    —The Great Controversy, page 273.
                        "According to the words of the prophet, then, a little before
                    the year 1798 some power of satanic origin and character
                    would rise to make war upon the Bible. And in the land where
                    the testimony of God's two witnesses should thus be silenced,
                    there would be manifest the atheism of the Pharaoh and the
                    licentiousness of Sodom.

              Part 5      What events took place after the resurrection of the wit-
      THE WITNESSES    nesses?
            REVIVED
                          "And after three days and an half the spirit of life from
                       God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and
                       great fear fell upon them which saw them. And they heard
                       a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up hither.
                       And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their ene-
                       mies beheld Them." Rev. 11:11, 12.


                          "It was in 1793 that the decrees which abolished the
                       Christian religion and set aside the Bible passed the French
                       Assembly. Three years and a half later a resolution rescinding
                       these decrees, thus granting toleration to the Scriptures, was
                       adopted by the same body. The world stood aghast at the
                       enormity of guilt which had resulted from a rejection of the
                       Sacred Oracles, and men recognized the necessity of faith in
                       God and His word as the foundation of virtue and morality."
                       —The Great Controversy, page 287.
                          Through the power of God and His sovereignty over men
                       and nations the two witnesses were restored to the exalted
                       position which they deserve as the Word of God.
                          "Since France made war upon God's two witnesses, they
                       have been honored as never before. In 1804 the British and
                       Foreign Bible Society was organized. This was followed by
                       similar organizations, with numerous branches, upon the con-
                       tinent of Europe. In 1816 the American Bible Society was
                       founded. When the British Society was formed, the Bible had
                       been printed and circulated in fifty tongues. It has since been
                       translated into many hundreds of languages and dialects."—

                         What does God say concerning the indestructibility of His
                       Word? Mark 13:31; Isa. 55:11.


                           "In the word of God only is this clearly set forth. Here it
                       is shown that the strength of nations, as of individuals, is not
                       found in the opportunities or facilities that appear to make
                       them invincible; it is not found in their boasted greatness. It
                       is measured by the fidelity with which they fulfill God's pur-
                       pose."—Education, page 175.

                                                                             June 21

          Part 6       "And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and
         END OF     the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were
                    slain of men seven thousand: and the remnant were affrighted,
     SECOND WOE     and gave glory to the God of heaven. The second woe is past;
                    and, behold, the third woe cometh quickly." Rev. 11:13, 14.
                        The great earthquake is not to be confused with the earth-
                    quake of the sixth seal (Rev. 6:12) which, anticipatory of the
                    end of 1260 years, fell on Lisbon in 1755; but this earthquake
                    strikes the great city and is symbolic of destruction and loss
                    of life. (See Isa. 29:1-6 for a similar prophecy about Jerusalem.)
                    The "great city" involves more than France—it is symbolic of
                    the power of Babylon.
                        "A day of retribution at last had come. It was not now the
                    disciples of Jesus that were thrust into dungeons and dragged
                    to the stake. Long ago these had perished or been driven into
                    exile. Unsparing Rome now felt the deadly power of those
                    whom she had trained to delight in deeds of blood. 'The ex-
                    ample of persecution which the clergy of France had exhibited
                    for so many ages, was now retorted upon them with signal
                    vigor. The scaffolds ran red with the blood of the priests. The
                    galleys and the prisons, once crowded with Huguenots, were
                    now filled with their persecutors. Chained to the bench and
                    toiling at the oar, the Roman Catholic clergy experienced all
                    those woes which their church had so freely inflicted on the
                    gentle heretics.' "—The Great Controversy, page 283.
                        The judgments on papal Rome by atheistic powers finally
                     culminated in the arrest and imprisonment of the pope in 1798
                    —an event known as the "deadly wound." The Turkish power
                    had waned, ceased to be a threat, and in the 1840's actually
                    placed herself under the control of Christian nations. The
                     scene now shifts from the papacy to the lamblike beast which
                    is soon to exercise global influence.
                      What Scriptural principle of judgments is applicable to our
                    society as well as to ancient Israel? Prov. 26:2; Hosea 8:7.

                       "It is with reluctance that the Lord withdraws His presence
                    from those who have been blessed with great light and who
                    have felt the power of the word in ministering to others. They
                    were once His faithful servants, favored with His presence and
                    guidance; but they departed from Him and led others into error,
                    and therefore are brought under the divine displeasure."—

   The events of the seventh trumpet climax the whole series of trumpets
just as the great stone formed the most important feature of Nebuchad-
nezzar's vision in Daniel 2. The first six trumpets have been viewed in his-
torical perspective and raise the question: What meaning have these events
for today? The answer lies not in any single trumpet but in the unit of seven
climaxed by the kingdoms of earth being given into the hands of Jesus. What
could have more meaning for our time than that?
   Two songs of the 24 elders point out the distinction between the seals
and the trumpets. In Revelation 5:12 the elders ascribe worthiness to the
Lamb to receive power, while in Revelation 11:17, 18 the elders' song offers
praise that the power of God is used in ruling the earth.
   The recognition of worthiness to receive power is the same as the vindi-

cation of God's character, and the actual reception of power is the applica-
tion of the principles of His vindicated character to the rulership of earth. The
first is related to the cross; the second is related to the second advent of
Jesus and the accompanying events.
    "Dear brethren, the Lord is coming. Lift up your thoughts and heads and
rejoice. Oh, we would think that those who hear the joyful news, who claim
to love Jesus, would be filled with joy unutterable and full of glory. This is
the good, the joyful news which should electrify every soul, which should
be repeated in our homes and told to those whom we meet on the street.
What more joyful news can be communicated! Caviling and contention with -
believers or unbelievers is not the work God has given us to do.
    "If Christ is my Saviour, my sacrifice, my atonement, then I shall never
perish. Believing on Him, I have life forevermore. Oh, that all who believe
the truth would believe in Jesus as their own Saviour. I do not mean that
cheap faith unsupported by works, but that earnest, living, constant, abiding
faith, that eats the flesh and drinks the blood of the Son of God. I want not
only to be pardoned for the transgression of God's holy law, but I want to
be lifted into the sunshine of God's countenance. Not simply to be admitted
to heaven, but to have an abundant entrance."—Selected Messages, Bk. 2,

      THE THIRD WOE
                          "And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great
                       voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are
                       become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he
                       shall reign for ever and ever." Rev. 11:15.
                           "About His coming cluster the glories of that 'restitution of
                       all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all His holy
                       prophets since the world began.' Acts 3:21. Then the long-
                       continued rule of evil shall be broken; 'the kingdoms of this
                       world' will become 'the kingdoms of our Lord, and of His Christ;
                       and He shall reign for ever and ever.' Revelation 11:15."—The
                       Great Controversy, page 301.
                           "Christ, as stated by the prophet Daniel, will receive from
                       the Ancient of Days in heaven, 'dominion, and glory, and a
                       kingdom;' He will receive the New Jerusalem, the capital of
                       His kingdom, 'prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.'
                       Daniel 7:14; Revelation 21:2. Having received the kingdom,
                       He will come in His glory, as King of kings and Lord of lords,
                       for the redemption of His people. . . .
                           "At the appointed time the Bridegroom came, not to the
                       earth, as the people expected, but to the Ancient of Days in
                       heaven, to the marriage, the reception of His kingdom. 'They
                       that were ready went in with Him to the marriage: and the door
                       was shut.' They were not to be present in person at the mar-
                       riage; for it takes place in heaven, while they are upon the
                       earth. The followers of Christ are to 'wait for their Lord, when
                       He will return from the wedding.' Luke 12:36. But they are to
                       understand His work, and to follow Him by faith as He goes
                       in before God. It is in this sense that they are said to go in to
                       the marriage."—The Great Controversy, page 427. It is in this
                       sense also that Christ receives His kingdom.
                          What occurs between the time when Jesus symbolically
                       receives His kingdom and the time when He receives it in
                       actuality? Matt. 22:11-14.

                          "He who is found wanting is cast out, but all who upon ex-
                       amination are seen to have the wedding garment on are ac-
                       cepted of God and accounted worthy of a share in His kingdom
                       and a seat upon His throne. This work of examination of char-
                       acter, of determining who are prepared for the kingdom of

           Part 2      What was the prayer of the elders?
     RESPONSE OF       "And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God
      THE ELDERS    on their seats, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God,
                    saying, We give thee thanks, 0 Lord God Almighty, which
                    art, and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to
                    thee thy great power, and hast reigned." Rev. 11:16, 17.

                       Whenever praise and glory is given to Christ, the elders
                    participate. Following the seven churches and prior to the
                    seven seals they echo the anthem of love to the slain Lamb.
                    When Christ symbolically receives His kingdom, the elders
                    once more respond in praise and glory to God and to His
                    Christ.
                       The elders rejoice, for finally the prayers of the saints
                    under the altar are being acted upon, and Christ assumes His
                    great power to culminate His work on the earth among men
                    and among nations. The final time has actually come, and this
                    brings forth an anthem of praise and glory from the elders
                    who so long have witnessed the battle between truth and
                    error.
                      What response is expected from His saints here below?
                    Rev. 19:5-8.
                       This response of the twenty-four elders is but one of the
                    stanzas, as it were, of the same song that has been sung by
                    both men and angels. At Bethlehem "earth was hushed, and
                    heaven stooped to listen to the song,—'Glory to God in the
                    highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.' Oh that
                    today the human family could recognize that song! The de-
                    claration then made, the note then struck, will swell to the
                    close of time, and resound to the ends of the earth. When the
                    Sun of Righteousness shall arise, with healing in His wings,
                    that song will be re-echoed by the voice of a great multitude,
                    as the voice of many waters, saying, 'Alleluia: for the Lord
                    God omnipotent reigneth.' Rev. 19.6
                       "Heaven and earth are no wider apart today than when
                    shepherds listened to the angels' song. Humanity is still as
                    much the object of heaven's solicitude as when common men
                    of common occupations met angels at noonday, and talked
                    with the heavenly messengers in the vineyards and the fields.
                    To us in the common walks of life, heaven may be very near.
                    Angels from the courts above will attend the steps of those

          Part 3         What two points of identification of time were given to
  ANGRY NATIONS       John?

                          "And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and
                      the time of the dead, that they should be judged." Rev. 11:18,
                      first part.
                         "At that time, while the work of salvation is closing, trouble
                      will be coming on the earth, and the nations will be angry, yet
                      held in check so as not to prevent the work of the third angel.
                      At that time the 'latter rain,' or refreshing from the presence of
                      the Lord, will come, to give power to the loud voice of the
                      third angel, and prepare the saints to stand in the period when
                      the seven last plagues shall be poured out."—Early Writings,
                      pages 85, 86.
                         "The long-suffering of God is wonderful, because He puts
                      constraint on His own attributes; but punishment is nonetheless
                      certain. Every century of profligacy has treasured up wrath
                      against the day of wrath; and when the time comes, and the
                      iniquity is full, then God will do His strange work. It will be
                      found a terrible thing to have worn out the divine patience; for
                      the wrath of God will fall so signally and strongly that it is
                      represented as being unmixed with mercy; and the very earth
                      will be desolated."—Selected Messages, Bk. 2, pp. 372, 373.
                        In spite of the fact that time has continued longer than
                      expected, what should be the proper attitude of the saints?
                      Romans 13:11, 12.

                          "I saw that the anger of the nations, the wrath of God, and
                      the time to judge the dead, were separate and distinct, one
                      following the other; also that Michael had not stood up, and
                      that the time of trouble, such as never was, had not yet com-
                      menced. The nations are now getting angry, but when our
                      High Priest has finished His work in the sanctuary, He will
                      stand up, put on the garments of vengeance, and then the
                      seven last plagues will be poured out."—Life Sketches, page
                      117.
                          "During the thousand years between the first and the second
                      resurrection the judgment of the wicked takes place. . . . In
                      union with Christ they [the righteous] judge the wicked, com-
                      paring their acts with the statute book, the Bible, and deciding
                      every case according to the deeds done in the body."—The
                      Great Controversy, pages 660, 661.

                                                                        June 26

          Part 4       "And that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants
       CALLED TO    the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy name,
                    small and great; and shouldest destroy them which destroy
  ACCOUNTABILITY    the earth." Rev. 11:18, last part.

                        Verse 18 is a call to accountability. "In the presence of the
                    assembled inhabitants of earth and heaven the final coronation
                    of the Son of God takes place. And now, invested with supreme
                    majesty and power, the King of kings pronounces sentence
                    upon the rebels against His government and executes justice
                    upon those who have transgressed His law and oppressed His
                    people."—The Great Controversy, page 666.
                        "'The indignation of the Lord is upon all nations, and His
                    fury upon all their armies: He hath utterly destroyed them, He
                    hath delivered them to the slaughter.' . . . Fire comes down
                    from God out of heaven. The earth is broken up. The weapons
                    concealed in its depths are drawn forth. Devouring flames
                    burst from every yawning chasm. The very rocks are on fire.
                    The day has come that shall burn as an oven. . . . It is the
                    time of the judgment and perdition of ungodly men—'the day
                    of the Lord's vengeance, and the year of recompenses for the
                    controversy of Zion.' "—The Great Controversy, pages 672,
                    673.
                        What is the description given by Joel of the judgment day
                    of nations? Joel 3:9-12.

                        "While the earth was wrapped in the fire of destruction, the
                    righteous abode safely in the Holy City. Upon those that had
                    part in the first resurrection, the second death has no power.
                    While God is to the wicked a consuming fire, He is to His
                    people both a sun and a shield. Revelation 20:6; Psalm 84:11.
                    'I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and
                    the first earth were passed away.' Revelation 21:1. The fire
                    that consumes the wicked purifies the earth. Every trace of
                    the curse is swept away....
                         "God's original purpose in the creation of the earth is ful-

                    Great Controversy, pages 673, 674.

 THINK IT THROUGH       "Because sentence against an evil work is not executed
                    speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set
                    in them to do evil. Though a sinner do evil an hundred times,
                    and his days be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be
                    well with them that fear God, which fear before him." Eccl.

The Trumpet of Victory          LESSON 13                              ❑ Thursday
                                                                          June 27

             Part 5       "And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there
        THE TEMPLE    was seen in his temple the ark of his testament." Rev. 11:19,
                      first part.
         IN HEAVEN
                         The ark of God's testament is in the holy of holies, the
                      second apartment of the sanctuary. Symbolically, "the an-
                      nouncement that the temple of God was opened in heaven
                      and the ark of His testament was seen points to the opening
                      of the most holy place of the heavenly sanctuary in 1844 as
                      Christ entered there to perform the closing work of the atone-
                      ment."—The Great Controversy, page 433.
                         Thus at His second coming the ark of God with the original
                      commandments is revealed. The following quotation points out
                      that at the final extermination of the wicked at the end of the
                      one thousand years, the law will be seen again.
                         "That holy law, God's righteousness, that amid thunder
                      and flame was proclaimed from Sinai as the guide of life, is
                      now revealed to men as the rule of judgment. The hand opens
                      the tables, and there are seen the precepts of the Decalogue,
                      traced as with a pen of fire. The words are so plain that all
                      can read them. Memory is aroused, the darkness of supersti-
                      tion and heresy is swept from every mind, and God's ten
                      words, brief, comprehensive, and authoritative, are presented
                      to the view of all the inhabitants of the earth."—The Great
                      Controversy, page 639.
                         Again, a description of the end of the millennium: "As if
                      entranced, the wicked have looked upon the coronation of the
                      Son of God. They see in His hands the tables of the divine
                      law, the statutes which they have despised and transgressed."
                      —The Great Controversy, pages 668, 669.

                         What did David say concerning the nature of God? Ps.
                      119:89. See also Mal. 3:6.

                         "It is impossible to describe the horror and despair of those
                      who have trampled upon God's holy requirements. The Lord
                      gave them His law; they might have compared their characters
                      with it and learned their defects while there was yet oppor-
                      tunity for repentance and reform; but in order to secure the
                      favor of the world, they set aside its precepts and taught others
                      to transgress. . . . With awful distinctness they see that they
                      are without excuse. They chose whom they would serve and
                      worship."—The Great Controversy, pages 639, 640.

The Trumpet of Victory LESSON 13                                        0 Friday
                                                                           June 28

          Part 6      "And there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings,
                    and an earthquake, and great hail." Rev. 11:19, last part.
       NATURE'S
       RESPONSE         It is evident that the seventh trumpet encompasses all events
                    from 1844 through the second coming, and the millennium to
                    the destruction of the wicked and the new earth. It is God's
                    final judgment on the empires of the world as were the former
                    trumpets on the empires of both pagan and papal Rome. Thus
                    in capsule form the seventh trumpet presents God's final acts
                    in the great controversy.
                        "It is at midnight that God manifests His power for the de-
                    liverance of His people. The sun appears, shining in its
                    strength. Signs and wonders follow in quick succession. The
                    wicked look with terror and amazement upon the scene, while
                    the righteous behold with solemn joy the tokens of their de-
                    liverance. Everything in nature seems turned out of its course.
                    The streams cease to flow. Dark, heavy clouds come up and
                    clash against each other. In the midst of the angry heavens
                    is one clear space of indescribable glory, whence comes the
                    voice of God like the sound of many waters, saying: 'It is
                    done.' Revelation 16:17.
                         "That voice shakes the heavens and the earth. There is a
                     mighty earthquake, 'such as was not since men were upon the
                    earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great.' Verses 17, 18.
                     The firmament appears to open and shut. The glory from the
                     throne of God seems flashing through. The mountains shake
                     like a reed in the wind, and ragged rocks are scattered on
                     every side. There is a roar as of a coming tempest. The sea
                     is lashed into fury. There is heard the shriek of a hurricane
                     like the voice of demons upon a mission of destruction. The
                     whole earth heaves and swells like the waves of the sea. Its
                     surface is breaking up. Its very foundations seem to be giving
                     way. Mountain chains are sinking. Inhabited islands disap-
                     pear. . . . Great hailstones, every one 'about the weight of
                     a talent,' are doing their work of destruction. Verses 19, 21.
                     The proudest cities of the earth are laid low. The lordly
                     palaces, upon which the world's great men have lavished
                     their wealth in order to glorify themselves, are crumbling to
                      ruin before their eyes. Prison walls are rent asunder, and
                     God's people, who have been held in bondage for their faith,
                      are set free."—The Great Controversy, pages 636, 637.
