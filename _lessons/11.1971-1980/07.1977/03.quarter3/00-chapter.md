                               good sense. Nicodemus
                               knew that. But still he
                               searched for something
                               more. "Be born again" Jesus
                               had said. The sight of
                               Jesus on the cross final-
                               ized the new birth in
                               Nicodemus' life. And in the
                               years which followed, he
                               gave his entire wealth to
                               establish the young church.
                               And considered it his best
                               investment ever.

                               When the Sabbath School
                               offering is received this
                               week, before you give,
                               re-examine your priorities
                               in light of the Cross. When
                               Nicodemus did , he
                               invested his whole life. Can
                               you think of a better

       To the Sabbath School Members
       around the World


       Dear Members and Friends:

       It is a special privilege to belong to the great Sabbath School
       family and thus to have a part in world-wide mission work. Through
       the systematic study of the Scriptures, as well as by our mission
       offerings, the Sabbath School has been the source of great blessing
       to us. I would not miss this opportunity to express my heartfelt
       appreciation to all our Sabbath School members and friends for their
       faithfulness and willing sacrifice. The following three projects
       in the Euro-Africa Division will benefit from the Thirteenth Sabbath
       Overflow this quarter:

       1. Nanga-Eboko Seminary: Dormitory and Homes

           The future of our work in the countries of French-speaking Africa
       depends on the proper training of national workers. Construction
       has started at this institution in Cameroun. A dormitory for single
       and married theological and teacher-training students, and dwellings
       for the teachers must be built.

       2. Collonges Seminary: Library

           The Seminary at Collonges, France, occupies a vital place in
       the training of French-speaking workers for both Europe and Africa.
       A new library is their most pressing need, for the present facil-
       ities are totally inadequate.

       3. Marienhohe Seminary: Chapel

           The growth of the college church at MarienhOhe, Germany, has
       demanded the use of the gymnasium for holding Sabbath services. A
       church building is their urgent need.

       To make these projects a reality, we are inviting our Sabbath
       Schools around the world to bring the Lord a special offering on
       this Thirteenth Sabbath. Knowing of the willingness of your sacri-
       fice in the past, I am convinced that you will gladly share in
       the development and progress of the work which has been entrusted
       to us.

       In the spirit of Christian fellowship, I send you my sincere
       thanks in anticipation.

                   GOD'S CHOSEN PEOPLE
                                   Introduction
    During the last one hundred years the Seventh-day Adventist Church has grown
from a small group of 7000 believers to a worldwide movement of 3,000,000 people. In
1877 it was a rather isolated communion in North America. Now it is an international
church, planted in over 90 percent of all the countries of the world. The church began
poor and without organization. This denomination today operates thousands of
institutions. It is respected for having one of the finest missionary structures and
most effective organizations in the world. Yet these very developments, especially of
recent years, pose a number of problems which challenge us to consider the ques-
tion: What does it mean to be the church of God today?
    The quest for national and cultural identity in many areas threatens the unity of our
church formation. This raises the question: What is the biblical basis and form of
church unity? In a few areas the Seventh-day Adventist Church has become the
largest single Protestant denomination, which gives it considerable prestige and
social power. In some countries Seventh-day Adventists do not identify themselves as
a church. They speak of themselves as a communion or a fellowship of Seventh-day
Adventists. To these believers the very word "church" stands for social control,
clerical power, falsehood, oppression, Babylon, and anti-Christ. A new look at the
biblical meaning of "church" may help to settle this issue.
    Another series of questions arises concerning the church's relationship to the
state, and to the world in general. Recent changes in the church's attitude toward
accepting government funds for the operation of ,its medical and educational institu-
tions demand clarification of the essence and nature of the church. The deepening
 conflicts between the church's institutions on one hand, and powerful con-
 federacies, labor unions, and government agencies on the other, only deepen that
 need.
    A number of internal tensions and developments likewise emphasize the need for a
 systematic study on the biblical view of the church. Traditional patterns of authority
 and control have been challenged; questions are raised concerning the role of
 women in the church and their ordination to the ministry; lay movements are urging
 new forms of lay participation in the administration of the church, etc.
     Finally, the radically changed missionary situation demands that we take an honest
 look at ourselves and determine our priorities according to the biblical concepts.
 Two billion people have never heard with clarity the gospel of Jesus Christ. In many of
 the existing Christian churches secularization moves ahead along with other
 changes. In these conditions the question must be asked: What does it mean to
 belong to God's chosen people today?
     Seventh-day Adventists see themselves as a group called to the service of preach-
 ing the final message to the world. To be a chosen people in this sense does not mean
 that only they will be redeemed, or that all Seventh-day Adventists will be saved. They
  recognize the existence of the church invisible made up of all people who have a true
  faith in Jesus, regardless of their church communion.
     "There is great necessity for a reformation among the people of God. The present
  state of the church leads to the inquiry: Is this a correct representation of Him who
  gave His life for us?"—Testimonies, vol. 3, p. 474.
     May this quarter's study on the biblical view of the church help to lay the founda-
  tions for such a reformation.

          ALONE
                    The history of God's chosen people begins with Abraham.
                  God called him away from his surroundings, blessed him, and
                  made a covenant with him. (See Genesis 12 through 17.)

                     What promises did God make in His covenant with Abra-
                   ham? Gen. 12:2, 3; 15:18.
                      At least four characteristics of the covenant relationship be-
                   tween God and Abraham stand out clearly: (1) It was God who
                   chose Abraham; it was not Abraham who first chose God. (2)
                   The covenant is a promise of God's blessing and eternal protec-
                   tion. (3) The covenant relates not only to the present, but to the
                   future as well. (4) The covenant includes not only Abraham and
                   his immediate family; it includes also his descendants after him,
                   generation after generation.

                     What was Abraham's role in the covenant relationship? Gen.
                   15:6; 17:9, 10.
                     Though the covenant has its origin with God, it is clearly a
                   two-way relationship. In return for His grace, God invites us to
                   put our trust in Him and to obey His word.

                     What are some ways in which Abraham is an example to
                   every believer today? Heb. 11:8-10; James 2:21-24.

                     The starting point of man's salvation is God's call to come
                   away from his surroundings. By accepting that call—that is, by
                   putting our faith in God and obeying His word—we become
                   participants in God's covenant promises.

THINK IT THROUGH     How can all nations on earth share in the blessings of the
                   covenant that God made with Abraham?

                     It was by way of Abraham that God entered into the world of all
                   nations. His election, and that of all who put thei r trust in God, is
                   not primarily a privilege, but a responsibility. Election as one of
                   the chosen people of God is an election for service. When the
                   service is withheld, the election loses its meaning.
                      "The people of God are His representatives upon the earth,
                   and He intends that they shall be lights in the moral darkness of
                   this world. Scattered all over the country, in the towns, cities,
                   and villages, they are God's witnesses, the channels through
                   which He will communicate to an unbelieving world the knowl-
                   edge of His will and the wonders of His grace." —Patriarchs and
                   Prophets, p. 134.

A Covenant People         LESSON 1                                    ❑ Monday
                                                                        June 27

           Part 2   "I am the Lord thy God which have brought thee out of the
        GRACE AND land Of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt have no
        OBEDIENCE other gods before me" (Ex. 20:2, 3).

                      During the 400 years from Abraham to Moses God kept His
                    covenant relationship with His people. It was because of the
                    covenant relationship that God delivered His people from op-
                    pression and made them an independent nation under Himself.

                      What Is the relationship between the Decalogue and God's
                    covenant with Israel at Sinai? Ex. 19:4, 5; 20:1, 2.

                      Obedience is a response to the God who redeemed us. The
                    commandments were given by the Deliverer of Israel to allow
                    His people to participate in the covenant He had made with
                    them. The law is an instrument of God's covenant with His
                    people, a covenant of grace. The commandments remind the
                    people constantly of their God who redeemed them. They chal-
                    lenge God's chosen people to put their whole trust only in Him
                    and to remain within the covenant relationship with their Re-
                    deemer.

                       What particular function has the Sabbath In God's covenant
                     with His people? Ex. 31:13, 16, 17.

                      Among the visible signs of the special relationship between
                    God and His chosen people, the Sabbath is truly unique. Unlike
                    such signs as land or circumcision, the Sabbath has no parallel
                    outside of Israel. Its rhythm of six plus one is not rooted in a
                    natural cycle, such as the day, the month, or the year. The
                    Sabbath is the perpetual seal of the special relationship be-
                    tween God and His people. When we break that seal, we break
                    the covenant.

THINK IT THROUGH       How does God's election of Israel reflect God's love for all
                     humanity?

                       "The opinion is held by many that God placed a separating
                     wall between the Hebrews and the outside world; that His care
                     and love, withdrawn to a great extent from the rest of mankind,
                     were centered upon Israel. But God did not design that His
                     people should build up a wall of partition between themselves
                     and their fellow men. The heart of Infinite Love was reaching out
                     toward all the inhabitants of the earth. Though they had rejected
                     Him, He was constantly seeking to reveal Himself to them and
                     make them partakers of His love and grace. His blessing was
                     granted to the chosen people, that they might bless others."—

A Covenant People          LESSON 1                                    ❑ Tuesday
                                                                         June 28

             Part 3   "The Lord our God will we serve, and his voice will we obey.
         A RENEWED So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set
        FELLOWSHIP them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem. And Joshua
                    wrote these words in the book of the law of God" (Joshua 24:
                    24-26).

                        Joshua called the twelve tribes of Israel to assemble in
                     Shechem. Upon their solemn declaration to serve the Lord and
                     to obey His will, the people were brought into a covenant fellow-
                     ship with one another. It was on this day that God's people
                     formally entered a renewed fellowship. The wandering tribes
                     were now settled in the Promised Land. Their covenantal rela-
                     tionship with God became the basis of a new covenantal fellow-
                     ship with each other. Israel was established in its homeland.
                        God's presence was manifested in a central place of worship
                     where all the people regularly assembled. The ark of the coven-
                     ant was the sign of the presence of God among His people, and
                     the tabernacle, later the temple, served as the central sanctuary.
                     The unity and fellowship among the tribes was thus manifested
                     in regular assemblies at a central place of worship.

                       For what purpose did God's chosen people assemble? Ex.
                     23:14-17.

                       The men from the twelve tribes of Israel met three times a year
                     for the great festivals in the central sanctuary. In the Passover,
                     the mighty acts of God in the past became an immediate, pres-
                     ent reality. At the Feasts of Weeks and of Tabernacles the
                     assembled people of God were assured of the God-given foun-
                     dations of their present life. The laws of these feasts ceased at
                     the cross.

THINK IT THROUGH       How could this fellowship of the believers and the presence
                     of the Lord become more manifest in our assemblies?

                        "At these yearly assemblies the hearts of old and young would
                     be encouraged in the service of God, while the association of
                     the people from the different quarters of the land would
                     strengthen the ties that bound them to God and to one another.
                     Well would it be for the people of God at the present time to have
                     a Feast of Tabernacles—a joyous commemoration of the bless-
                     ings of God to them. As the children of Israel celebrated the
                     deliverance that God had wrought for their fathers, and His
                     miraculous preservation of them during their journeyings from
                     Egypt, so should we gratefully call to mind the various ways He
                     has devised for bringing us out from the world, and from the
                     darkness of error, into the precious light of His grace and
                     truth."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 540, 541.

A Covenant People        LESSON 1                                 ❑ Wednesday
                                                                      June 29

         Part 4   "God be merciful unto us, and bless us; and cause his face
     ISRAEL AND to shine upon us; Selah. That thy, way may be known upon
    THE NATIONS earth, and thy saving health among all nations."
                  "God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear
                him" (Ps. 67:1, 2, 7).

                     What was David's prayer request for the nations (the hea-
                   then)? Ps. 86:9.

                     The writers of Genesis, Psalms, and the prophetical books
                   testify that God is the author of all that lives. He created all the
                   nations. He set their boundaries, and He is deeply concerned for
                   the salvation of all people.

                     How were the chosen people to relate to the heathen? Isa.
                   43:10; Zech. 8:23.

                     The covenant God made with Abraham embraced all nations
                   (Gen. 12:2,3), in the same way as all creatures were included in
                   God's covenant with Noah (Gen. 9:8-15). God sent Joseph into
                   Egypt to preserve life in all the countries of the famine (Gen.
                   45:5-8). God sent Moses as a light into the world, as an instru-
                   ment of God to teach all nations. God's act of electing Israel and
                   endowing them with special favors and privileges did not imply
                   a rejection of the heathen. Rather, God called a special people
                   into existence to serve as His priests to the whole world, as
                   channels of His grace to all people. The nation of Israel was
                   elected to be a light unto the nations, calling all to repentance
                   and to worship the Creator as the only true God.

                     How did Israel acquit itself of Its priestly role among the
                   nations? Isa. 5:3-7; Hosea 10:1.

                     "Israel did not fulfill God's purpose. . . .
                        .. The blessings they had received brought no blessing to
                   the world. All their advantages were appropriated for their own
                   glorification. They robbed God of the service He required of
                   them, and they robbed their fellow men of religious guidance
                   and a holy example."—Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 290-292.
                     "The Jewish people cherished the idea that they were the
                   favorites of heaven, and that they were always to be exalted as
                   the church of God."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 294.

THINK IT THROUGH     Does the church of God today perhaps stand in the same
                   danger of losing sight of their true calling? How could it be
                   avoided? (See Rom. 15:4; 1 Cor. 10:11.)

A Covenant People          LESSON 1                                 ❑ Thursday
                                                                       June 30

             Part 5   "Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and
          APOSTASY Judah hath multiplied fenced cities." "Thou hest gone a whor-
                    ing from thy God, thou hast loved a reward" (Hosea 8:14; 9:1).

                        Through a series of mighty acts the Lord chose and called
                     Israel to be His people. But His chosen people, called and
                     elected and brought into a covenant relationship with Him, was
                     from the beginning, and then throughout its history, inclined to
                     be unfaithful to its calling and to break the covenant.

                       What was the general nature of the apostasy of Israel and
                     Judah? 2 Kings 18:11, 12; 2 Chron. 36:14-16.

                       God had done everything possible for His people. Yet there
                     was never a time of perfect obedience to the Lord. Israel first
                     apostatized at the conclusion of the covenant, when they wor-
                     shiped the golden calf. Aaron called a feast to the Lord at the
                     worship of this image. Their great sin was that they mixed the
                     religion of man with the revelation from God. And that is the
                     tragic story of God's people throughout the Old Testament.
                     They wanted to be God's chosen people and to be "like the
                     other nations." They wished to enjoy the special blessings as
                     God's church and enjoy at the same time the pleasures and
                     advantages the world had to offer. The real apostasy was not
                     that the chosen people no longer professed belief in the Lord,
                     but that they did not put their trust in Him alone.

                      How did God react to His people's apostasy? Jer. 3: 12-15;
                     Hosea 3:1.

                       Instead of leaving Israel to its own whims and wishes, and
                     punishing His people for having rejected Him, God shows Him-
                     self a forgiving father, a loving husband, compassionate,
                     longsuffering, and merciful. He left nothing undone to call His
                     people back. (See Isa. 5:4.) He sent them His prophets, even
                     summoning other nations to bring Israel to its senses, through
                     oppression, and exile. But neither compassion nor constraint,
                     neither forgiveness nor force, had any lasting influence. The
                     people passed the word around, "Neither shall evil come upon
                     us; neither shall we see sword nor famine" (Jer. 5:12). It was
                     only when God's judgment came that the people recognized:
                     "The Lord is righteous; for I have rebelled against his com-
                     mandment" (Lam. 1:18).

THINK IT THROUGH      What parallels exist between Israel's apostasy and that of
                     God's church in these last days?

                                                                            July 1

          Part 6     "Not according to the covenant that I made with their fa-
      THE HOPE     thers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out
      OF ISRAEL    of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I
                   was an husband unto them, saith the Lord: but this shall be the
                   covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those
                   days, saith the Lord, I will put my law in their inward parts"
                   (Jer. 31:32, 33).

                     Judah's predicament, called for deliverance. Without the
                   promise of renewal, restoration, and redemption, life would
                   have been unbearable. Without hope, life is misery.

                      According to Ezekiel, in what way could Judah expect de-
                   liverance to come? Eze. 36:22-31.

                     The prophets promised three forms of deliverance. (1) A rem-
                   nant shall remain. Through them the purposes of God will be
                   carried out. (2) A new covenant will be made, marking the
                   beginning of a new era. (3) A Messiah will come. Through His
                   death expiation will be made for people's sins. He will establish
                   an eternal kingdom of peace and righteousness.

                     What is the difference between the old covenant and the
                   new? Jer. 31:31-34; Eze. 36:26, 27; Ex. 19:7, 8; 32:15, 16.

                     In essence, the principles and objectives of the two covenants
                   are the same. For the new people of God, as for the old, the basis
                   of the covenant is the unchanging will of God to be the Lord of
                   His people. He' calls and elects and blesses and makes us His
                   own. The only thing that is changed is the way in which the
                   people choose to make the laws of God their own. Although the
                   will of God was written on tables of stone, God has designed

       When God came to become one with His people in Christ, He
       demonstrated a love that transcends all human expression.

                                                                                July 3

             Part 1     "When the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth His
         JESUS, THE   Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them
        SON OF GOD    that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of
                      sons" (Gal. 4:4, 5).

                         Jesus once raised the question: Who do the people say the
                      Son of man is? Throughout His earthly life the identification of
                      Jesus ranged from Peter's immediate response "you are the
                      Christ, the son of the Living God" to "He is possessed; he is
                      raving. Why listen to Him?" (See Matt. 16:13, 14; John 10:19-21,
                      NEB). We moderns are still confronted by the same question,
                      and our answer determines the whole meaning—or lack of
                      meaning—of our life and existence. The only valid answer,
                      confirmed in Scripture, is: "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the
                      living God" (Matt. 16:16).

                       On what basis did Peter say, "Jesus is the Son of God"?
                      Matt. 16:17; 11:27.

                        Any individual who is confronted with Jesus recognizes in
                      Him a unique and very exceptional person. Even His enemies
                      had to admit that He was different—in authority, in power, in
                      character, in holiness. Jesus was God. He forgave men their
                      sins, which led critics to the reaction, "Who can forgive sins but
                      God only?" (Mark 2:7).
                        The belief that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of the living God,
                      is the very foundation upon which the church is built. God
                      became a man and lived among the people of Palestine some
                      2,000 years ago. Whoever denies this in words, acts, or thought
                      shuts himself out of the community of the new Israel. The belief
                      that Jesus is the Son of God is not just a doctrine. It is a
                      confession of faith.

                         What were the consequences of the Jewish people's rejec-
                      tion of Jesus as the Son of God? Matt. 21:42-44.

                         "Little did the Jews realize the terrible responsibility involved
                      in rejecting Christ.. . . By their rejection of the Saviour, they
                      were making themselves responsible for the blood of all the
                      righteous men slain from Abel to Christ. They were about to fill
                      to overflowing their cup of iniquity. And soon it was to be
                      poured upon their heads in retributive justice. Of this, Jesus
                      warned them."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 618, 619.

The Messiah Has Come           LESSON 2                              ❑ Monday
                                                                            July 4

          Part 2  "The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith,
      JESUS, THE Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the
    LAMB OF GOD world" (John 1:29).

                     The title Lamb of God points back to the sacrifices in the Old
                   Testament. It was especially appropriate as a title for Jesus
                   because of His suffering and sacrifice for sin.

                     What was the purpose of the sacrificial slaying of animals in
                   the Old Testament? Lev. 1:4; 4:27-29.

                     After their first sin, Adam and Eve stitched fig leaves together
                   to cover themselves. Afraid to meet their Maker, they hid them-
                   selves when they heard His voice. God had to punish them. But
                   during probation punishment is never the last word. The Bible
                   says that God Himself made "coats of skins" for Adam and his
                   wife and clothed them (Gen. 3:21). In the death of the animals to
                   provide clothing is the foundation of all sacrifices.

                     What is the purpose of Christ's atoning sacrifice? Eph. 1:7;
                   2:11-18.

                     In meditating upon Christ's sacrifice, please think further of
                   the following message: "All things are of God, who hath recon-
                   ciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the
                   ministry of reconciliation" (2 Cor. 5:18).

                     What is one result of the covenant [testament] Christ has
                   established through His blood? Matt. 26:27-29. To whom does
                   God offer this new covenant? John 1:29.

                     The covenant is offered to all people, in all times. All are
                   invited; "For the love of Christ leaves us no choice, when once
                   we have reached the conclusion that one man died for all and
                   therefore all mankind has died" (2 Cor. 5:14, NEB). "He has
                   enlisted us in this service of reconciliation" (verse 18, NEB).

THINK IT THROUGH    What has been my habitual response toward the sacrifice of
                   Christ for me? What could it be?

                     "The atoning sacrifice seen through faith brings peace and
                   comfort and hope to the trembling soul weighed down beneath
                   the sense of guilt. The law of God is the detector of sin, and as
                   the sinner is drawn to the dying Christ, he sees the grievous
                   character of sin, and repents and lays hold on the remedy, the
                   Lamb of God, who taketh away the sin of the world."—Ellen G.

          Part 3     "The Son of man is come to seek and to save that which is
      JESUS, THE   lost" (Luke 19:10).
     SON OF MAN      "The Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to
                   minister, and to give his life a ransom for many" (Mark 10:45).

                     Jesus, though verily God, was at the same time truly man. The
                   Bible testifies that He "made himself of no reputation, and took
                   upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of
                   men: and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself,
                   and became obedient unto death" (Phil. 2:7, 8). This is a great
                   mystery, but it is the heart of the gospel, the basis of man's
                   salvation (1 John 4:2, 3).

                     In which way was the man Jesus different from us? 2 Cor.
                   5:21; 1 John 3:5.

                      Jesus was "made like unto his brethren, that he might be a
                   merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to
                   make reconciliation for the sins of the people" (Heb. 2:17). But
                   though He subjected Himself to all the humbling conditions of
                   man's fallen nature after thousands of years of sin, Jesus was
                   without sin. It was not because of His divinity that Jesus lived a
                   sinless life. He used no powers that are not available to any
                   person who by faith is renewed after the image of God. He has
                   given us an example. "As Jesus was in human nature, so God
                   means His followers to be."—Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 289.
                      The incarnation is significant for God's election of the new
                   Israel. In a beautiful passage (Philippians 2:5-11) on the incarna-
                   tion of Christ Paul says: "Let your bearing towards one another
                   arise out of your life in Christ Jesus" (NEB). The KJV gives for
                   "bearing," "mind." The Scriptures urge us to become as Jesus
                   was in human flesh, always giving glory to God our Father, and
                   loving our neighbor as ourselves.

THINK IT THROUGH     What will be the hallmark of the church whose members are
                   following the pattern of Christ? What is there in my life that
                   hinders me from becoming as He once was in human flesh?
                   (See Eph. 5:1, 2.)

                      "There is no surer way of weakening spirituality than by
                    cherishing envy, suspicion, faultfinding, and evil surmising. On
                    the other hand, the strongest witness that God has sent His Son
                   into the world is the existence of harmony and union among
                   men of varied dispositions who form His church. This witness it
                   is the privilege of the followers of Christ to bear."—The Acts of

        IS LORD all things, and we by him" (1 Cor. 8:6).

                     The Bible testifies that after Jesus had died for us, and was
                   buried, God the Father called Him to life again. (See Acts 2:31,
                   32.) He appeared to His friends and His disciples, whom He
                   commissioned to continue His work on earth, and then as-
                   cended into heaven, where He "sat on the right hand of God"
                   (Mark 16:19). (See also Luke 22 :69.) Stephen, filled with the Holy
                   Spirit, saw Jesus there (Acts 7:55, 56).

                    What is the meaning of Christ's being at the right hand of
                   God? 1 Peter 3:22.

                     The saying, seated "on the right hand of God," refers to the
                   full power and glory of Jesus after His resurrection and ascen-
                   sion. Jesus is Lord. (See Acts 2:36.) His Lordship is first of all
                   recognized by the members of His church. All authority in
                   heaven and on earth is given to Him. Therefore-that is, on the
                   basis of that authority—Jesus bade His disciples to go into all
                   the world and make disciples out of all nations (Matt. 28:18-20).
                   All gifts, powers, and the protection of the church are based on
                   the lordship of Christ. Because Jesus is Lord, life on earth has
                   meaning. We need not be tossed about by winds of evil and
                   waves of temptation. Jesus is Lord. Through His power we are
                   more than conquerors (Rom. 8:31-39). Our times are in His
                   hands. So is the life of the whole church, of which He is the Head
                   (Col. 1:18).
                      All history also is in His hand; all powers and dominions are
                   under His control. Eph. 1:18-23. He is the King of kings. His
                   kingship is different from that of the rulers of the earth. Christ
                   rules through love and persuasion, through grace and giving,
                   rather than through force. But His lordship is real. It is the
                   ground of our hope. One day all people, righteous and wicked,
                   will confess: "Jesus Christ is Lord" (Phil. 2:11).

                     What is the basis of the lordship of Christ? Phil. 2:5-11.

                      The word "wherefore" in Philippians 2:9 clearly indicates that
                   it is because of Christ's incarnation, humiliation, and sacrifice
                   at the cross that God has exalted Him as Lord of all and has
                   given Him all power in heaven and on earth. In Acts 2:34-36 we
                   read that the crucified One was exalted as Lord.

                                                                            July 7

            Part 5    There is one God, and one mediator between God and men,
        JESUS, OUR the man Christ Jesus; who gave himself a ransom for all, to be
         MEDIATOR testified in due time" (1 Tim. 2:5, 6).

                       When Christ entered into heaven to be crowned Lord of lords,
                     He entered also into the heavenly sanctuary to serve. He is
                     described as the "great high priest" (Heb. 4:14), appearing
                     before God for us. (Heb. 9:24). Stephen saw his Lord standing
                     there as the Son of man (Acts 7:56). Christ is serving in the
                     presence of His Father as a man, our representative.

                       Of what is Christ a mediator and with what results? Heb. 8:6,
                     10-12. See also Gal. 3:19, 20.

                         A "mediator" is a person whose task it is to reconcile two
                     parties. He is a peacemaker. In His mediation, Christ is not
                     influencing the Father to change His mind. The Bible makes it
                     very clear that it was God Himself who gave this Mediator. The
                     Father and the Son are one. Christ did not wrest our salvation
                     and peace from an avenging God, but He fulfilled and realized
                     God's promise made to Abraham (Heb. 6:13-20). God was in
                     Christ reconciling the world unto Himself (2 Cor. 5:19). What
                     Jesus' work as Mediator implies, then, is: (1) He makes His work
                     of reconciliation, achieved at the cross, become a reality in
                     people (peace); (2) Christ is making an application of His sac-
                     rifice for the benefit of all who come to Him (forgiveness of sins);
                     (3) Christ issanctifying His people. He is working out His perfect
                     life in us. (See 1 Cor. 15:57; Gal. 2:20.)

                       What has made Jesus a mediator? Heb. 10:10-12.

                        By what means is Christ accomplishing His work of recon-
                     ciliation and peacemaking on earth? John 15:26, 27;17:18, 20.

                       The texts clearly indicate that Christ has chosen to ac-
                     complish His work on earth through and in His followers under
                     the guidance of the Holy Spirit. Christ has sent us out so that
                     through our words and actions people may be persuaded to
                     accept Him as their Saviour and Lord.

THINK IT THROUGH       In what ways can I become an ambassador of reconciliation?

                       "Since His ascension Christ has carried forward His work on
                     earth by chosen ambassadors, through whom He speaks to the
                     children of men and ministers to their needs. The great Head of
                     the church superintends His work through the instrumentality
                     of men ordained by God to act as His representatives." —The

                                                                                July 8

          Part 6   "The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judg-
        JESUS, ment unto the Son" (John 5:22).
     OUR JUDGE
                   The judgment has a number of phases, butJesus is always the
                 Judge. There is the judgment that takes place when people
                 reject Jesus; then the investigative judgment; next the judg-
                 ment in the 1000 years; and last, the executive judgment when •
                 the wicked die for eternity.

                     What is one way Jesus brought judgment on the world?
                   John 5:22-24.

                      In the New Testament the word "judgment" is often a transla-
                   tion of krisis, which means a process of sifting, of separating the
                   righteous from the evildoers. The judgment by Christ is a pro-
                   cess which people bring about themselves. By rejecting the
                   light, they choose darkness; by not accepting the salvation
                   offered in Christ's blood, they opt for condemnation, together
                   with all evil and sin.
                      Because the rejecters of Jesus are already judged, their
                   names do not come up in the investigative judgment. It is the
                   wheat and tares within the church that are separated in the
                   investigative phase.

                     When will the final judgment of the world take place? Dan.
                   7:9, 10; 8:13, 14.

                      The final judgment began with Jesus' entrance into the Most
                   Holy Place of the heavenly sanctuary in 1844. The Bible also
                   speaks of a certain day in history when Christ's work of judging,
                   of separating the wheat from the tares, will become a visible
                   reality, and final. (See Matt. 13:40-43.) History will reach its final
                   climax when our Lord ceases His mediatorial work in heaven
                   and returns to this earth to pronounce the last judgment. Some
                   will enter into the kingdom of God, there to live forever. During
                   the 1,000 years a review will be made of all the cases of the lost.
                   At the close of the 1,000 years all of the lost will stand in judg-
                   ment before Christ and when sentenced will admit to the justice
                   of their sentence. Then the name of God will be vindicated and
                   the wicked destroyed. The kingdom of God will be restored.
                   Death and devil will be no more.

THINK IT THROUGH     What is the role of the church in Christ's present work of
                   judgment? Could it, by its life and work, hasten the day of
                   restoration?

          Part 1     "He came to his own home, and his own people received
      JESUS AND    him not" (John 1:11, RSV).
       THE JEWS
                     Jesus stated that He had come only for the lost sheep of the
                   house of Israel (Matt. 15:24). When Jesus commissioned His
                   disciples, He instructed them: "Go not into the way of the
                   Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not: but go
                   rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel" (Matt. 10:5, 6).
                     Jesus came to His own people, the ones who had received the
                   promise of His coming. It was in fulfillment of God's promise
                   made to Abraham that Christ came to bring salvation and the
                   restoration of Israel. They were the people with whom God had
                   made His covenant. Other persons were not excluded from the
                   benefits of Christ's work, but their needs could be met only
                   when His mission to Israel had been completed.

                    What was the nature of the Messiah's mission to Israel?
                   Dan. 9:24. (See also Matt. 1:21; John 17:4, 5.)

                     In a word: to reveal the Father, to offer salvation to Israel, and
                   to establish the kingdom of God.

                     How did the Jews react to God's compassionate love in the
                   person of Jesus Christ? Acts 3:13-15.

                      The Jews' rejection of Christ is in line with Israel's attitude
                   toward the covenant of God throughout Old Testament times.
                   (See 2 Chron. 36:15,16; Hosea 6:4-7.) The cross, the demonstra-
                   tion of God's love, is at the same time a demonstration of man's
                   hostile reaction toward God's love and grace. The cross that
                   could have brought Israel peace, restoration and happiness
                   forever now became their downfall and their ruin.

THINK IT THROUGH     What does the cross of Jesus Christ mean to me?

                     "To Paul the cross was the one object of supreme interest.
                   Ever since he had been arrested in his career of persecution
                   against the followers of the crucified Nazarene he had never
                   ceased to glory in the cross. At that time there had been given
                   him a revelation of the infinite love of God, as revealed in the
                   death of Christ; and a marvelous transformation had been
                   wrought in his life, bringing all his plans and purposes into
                   harmony with heaven. From that hour he had been a new man in
                   Christ. He knew by personal experience that when a sinner once
                   beholds the love of the Father, as seen in the sacrifice of His
                   Son, and yields to the divine influence, a change of heart takes
                   place, and henceforth Christ is all and in all."—The Acts of the

      THE CHURCH     according to the promise" (Gal. 3:29).
       AND ISRAEL
                       What is the meaning of the expression "Abraham's seed" in
                     this text and in others such as Isaiah 41:8 and John 8:33?

                       The expression "seed of Abraham" has clearly three distinct
                     meanings. First, is used for the natural descendants of Abraham
                     through the line of Isaac and Jacob (Rom. 9:7-9). ltssecond use
                     is for Jesus Christ Himself (Gal. 3:16). The true posterity of
                     Abraham is ultimately embodied in Jesus Christ. He is its sum-
                     mation and Head, for the promise was received through Him.
                     The third meaning is all who are in Christ, who keep the faith
                     and obey His commandments. This includes Jew and Gentile,
                     Greek and barbarian, African and American, Asian and Euro-
                     pean. All who are united to Christ, baptized in union with Him,
                     are Abraham's seed and so heirs by promise.
                        To belong to Abraham's seed, then, really means to be united
                     with Jesus Christ. Whoever believes in Him is thereby heir to the
                     promises given to Abraham. The church, whose head is Jesus
                     Christ, is thus the true Israel.

                      What is the relationship between the church and Israel?
                     Rom. 11:14-18.

                       In Christ the Gentiles have been made partakers of God's
                     promises to Israel (Eph. 3:6). We have become "fellow-heirs."
                     The church is not the only heir. God is still longing for the
                     esteem of Israel. It is through the church that God is fulfilling His
                     promise of salvation to all nations, kindreds, tongues, and
                     people. It is through the church, also, that God purposes to call
                     Israel to repentance and salvation (Rom. 11:11, 12, 25-31).
                     Though the church has indeed gone out to the Gentiles and won
                     many of them to Christ, it has, through the ages, neglected the
                     Jews. The purpose of God was that the church, through humility
                     and obedience, should make Israel envious of its salvation. The
                     church should never forget that it is but a wild branch "grafted
                     in among them." We share the same root, but we should not
                     make ourselves "superior to the branches. If you do so, re-
                     member that it is not you who sustain the root: the root sustains
                     you" (Rom. 11:17, 18, NEB).

THINK IT THROUGH       What is the church's message to Israel? How could
                     Seventh-day Adventist mission to the Jews best be ac-
                     complished?

                                                                          July 12

           Part 3  "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son,
       JESUS AND that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have
     THE GENTILES everlasting life" (John 3:16).

                      In accordance with the Old Testament, Jesus clearly asserted
                   the fundamental distinction between Israel and the nations of
                   the world in regard to God's redemptive purpose. It was Israel's
                   privilege as the vessel of the promises to receive the first offer of
                   salvation (Matt. 22:3). Yet, from the very beginning of His minis-
                   try, Jesus purposed to bring salvation to all nations.

                     What biblical evidence is there that Jesus ministered not
                   only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, but to the Gentiles
                   as well? Matt. 8:5-13; Mark 7:24-30; John 4:5-7.

                     Matthew described the beginning of Jesus' ministry to the
                   Gentiles, which he saw as a fulfillment of prophecy (Matt. 4:12-
                   17). He mentions "the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali,
                   toward the sea, across the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles—the
                   people who sat in darkness have seen a great light, and for
                   those who sat in the region and shadow of death light has
                   dawned" (RSV). (See also Isa. 9:1, 2.) And the report says, "His
                   fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all
                   sick people . . . ; and he healed them. And there followed him
                   great multitudes of people from Galilee, and from Decapolis,
                   and from Jerusalem, and from Judaea, and from beyond Jor-
                   dan" (Matt. 4:24, 25). Christ ministered to both Jew and Gentile.

                     In what way did Jesus confirm that His ministry was for the
                   Gentiles as well as for the Jews even before the Jews rejected
                   Him? Mark 11:15-19.

                      The court which Jesus cleansed was "the court of the Gen-
                   tiles." It was the only part of the sanctuary to which non-Jews
                   had access. It was separated from the inner courts by the "mid-
                   dle wall of partition" (Eph. 2:14). The only part of the house of
                   God which Gentiles were legally permitted to use to worship
                   God was closed to them by the trade and commerce of the Jews.
                   Quoting Isaiah 56:7, Jesus asserted: "Mine house shall be
                   called an house of prayer for all people." Though Jesus rebuked
                   the materialism and secularism of God's people when He
                   cleansed the outer court, He also made room in God's house for
                   the Gentiles to come and worship Him in peace and quietness.

THINK IT THROUGH     In which ways is the spirit which built up the partition wall
                   between Jew and Gentile still active?

The True Israel    LESSON 3                                      ❑ Wednesday
                                                                      July 13

          Part 4   "Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the
     THE CHURCH name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:
        AND THE teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have com-
         WORLD manded you: and,10,1 am with you alway, even unto the end of
                 the world" (Matt. 28:19, 20).

                     The church exists by mission as fire exists by burning. Mis-
                   sion is the life of the church, the very reason for its existence.

                     When did Jesus send His disciples into all the world? Mark
                   16:9, 14-20.

                      The story of Jesus' ministry does not end with His resurrec-
                   tion, but with His commission to go to all the world. These two
                   events are intimately related. By Christ's resurrection the name
                   of God was vindicated, and the "accuser of the brethren"
                   forever cast out of heaven. The time of salvation had come. This
                   had to be proclaimed. It could not have been told in the same
                   way before Christ's death and resurrection.

                     What is the content of the great commission Christ gave to
                   His church? Matt. 28:18-20.

                     1 .All power, all authority (RSV), has been given to Christ. He is
                   Lord of lords and King of kings. The whole world has therefore
                   been wrested from the grip of other powers, whatever their
                   nature, form or strength. (See Eph. 1:20-23.)
                      2. All nations are to be the recipients of the good news that
                   Christ is Lord. This can be achieved only when the followers of
                   Christ do not isolate themselves from the world or cluster to-
                   gether in colonies, but when they go, spread, travel, visit. The
                   making of disciples of all nations can happen only when the
                   church remains a movement.
                      3.1am with you always. After the proclamation of the author-
                   ity of Christ and the commandment, the promise follows of
                   Christ's eternal presence everywhere, in all things and all ways,
                   until the end of time.

THINK IT THROUGH    Given the power of Christ and the promise of His presence,
                   why has His commission not yet been fulfilled?

                     "The church is God's appointed agency for the salvation of
                   men. It was organized for service, and its mission is to carry the
                   gospel to the world. From the beginning it has been God's plan
                   that through His church shall be reflected to the world His
                   fullness and His sufficiency."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 9.

            Part 5     "He ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that
        JESUS AND    he might send them forth to preach" (Mark 3:14).
     HIS APOSTLES
                        The origin of the people of God in the New Testament, as in
                     Israel, lies with God's calling. He took the initiative. The forma-
                     tion of the church was not an idea that occurred to the disciples
                     only after the resurrection. It was Jesus' intention from the very
                     first days of His ministry.

                       What was the nature of the call the disciples received? Matt.
                     9:9; Luke 5:11; 9:23; John 1:43.

                       The group that Jesus gathered round Himself was meant to
                     have a decisive influence on the life of the society around it. The
                     Twelve were called to follow Jesus. That has remained the
                     hallmark of all the members of His church: They are called to be
                     Christians, followers of Jesus Christ. There is no greater call, no
                     higher status.

                       What was the basis of the twelve men's apostleship? Matt.
                     10:1, 2.

                       At least two basic requirements for apostleship can be distin-
                     guished. The first is discipleship. The text says that Jesus called
                     His disciples and then refers to them as apostles. Apostleship
                     must always be preceded by discipleship. The second is au-
                     thorization by Christ. "And he . . . gave them authority (RSV).
                     Jesus would say of them later, "They have kept thy word. . . . I
                     have given unto them the words which thou gayest me; ... they
                     have believed that thou didst send me" (John 17:6-8).

                      For what purpose did Jesus appoint His twelve apostles?
                     Mark 3:14.

                       "These men He purposed to train and educate as the leaders
                     of His church. They in turn were to educate others and send
                     them out with the gospel message. . . .
                       "It was at the ordination of the Twelve that the first step was
                     taken in the organization of the church that after Christ's depar-
                     ture was to carry on His work on the earth. . . .
                          .. By these feeble agencies, through His word and Spirit, He
                     designs to place salvation within the reach of all."—The Acts of
                     the Apostles, pp. 17, 18.

         Part 6  "[Ye] are built upon the foundation of the apostles and
    THE CHURCH prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone"
     APOSTOLIC (Eph. 2:20).

                     After the death of the twelve apostles, the early church soon
                   became divided over the question of the "apostolic succes-
                   sion." The issue is still debated today.

                     In light of the apostles' ordination and commission, what
                   really makes the church apostolic?

                      There are at least five essential elements to consider: (1) Does
                   it have the faith of Jesus? (2) Does it obey all that Christ has
                   commanded? (3) Is it following Jesus Christ in discipleship? (4)
                   Is it authorized by Christ? (5) Is it carrying out the great apos-
                   tolic commission? The church that bears these distinctive
                   marks of the apostles can rightly claim to be apostolic. The most
                   decisive factor is not the external or direct historical line, but the
                   spiritual. The thought is clarified by a paraphrase of Jesus'
                   words in John 8:39 concerning Abraham's children: "If ye were
                   the successors of the apostles, ye would do the works of the
                   apostles."

                     What is, in this light, the meaning of Matthew 16:18?

                      Throughout the history of the church the "rock" has been
                   variously interpreted as Peter, the confession of Peter, Jesus
                   Christ Himself, or all of the twelve apostles together. Jesus
                   called His disciple Peter (Greek: Petros), which means "a
                   stone." He then added, "Upon this rock [Greek: petra] I will
                   build my church." Notice the change: from Petros to petra, a
                   play on words that can best be explained by noting their mean-
                   ing. Petra means a massive rock, suitable for the foundation of a
                   large building. Petros, however, generally means a small stone,
                   such as might be used in a rock wall. Peter himself speaks of
                   Christ as the Rock. (See Acts 4:11, 12; 1 Peter 2:4-8.) Paul
                   likewise tells us that the Rock is Christ (1 Cor. 10:4). Finally, the
                   Scriptures teach that Jesus Christ is the foundation of the
                   church. (See 1 Cor. 3:11.) The entire structure rests on Him.

THINK IT THROUGH      Why is each believer called a living stone of the church?

                     "The Christian who faithfully presents the word of life, lead-
                   ing men and women into the way of holiness and peace, is
                   bringing to the foundation material that will endure, and in the

                                               image of the church as the body of
                                               Christ is so powerfully presented in
                                               the writings of the apostle Paul that no
                                               Christian can afford not to steep

                                               though misunderstandings may arise,
                                               and arise again. One of such
                                               misunderstandings today is the notion
                                               that the church is literally the body of
                                               Christ d
                                                 is p ysica presence, an extension o
                                               the incarnation. This concept is found
                                               especially—but not exclusively—in
                                               Roman Catholic thought. The "body
                                               of Christ" is not Christ Himself!

                                                 Christ did not come to incorporate us
                                                into His body according to the flesh
                                                but according to the Spirit. The church
                                                 is indeed characterized by the
                                               jresence of Christ through the.,Spirit,_

                                                                           July 17

            Part 1     "[He] hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be
        THE HEAD     the head over all things to the church, which Is his body" (Eph.
     OF THE BODY     1:22, 23).

                      What does it mean to say that Christ is Head of the church?
                     Col. 1:16-18; 2:6-10.

                        To say "head," according to these texts, is to say: He is the
                     source of the church, its very origin. He is the One in whom and
                     through whom and for whom the church is created—God who
                     in Christ took the initiative. He has called us and redeemed us;
                     He has bought us and brought us together in Him and with one
                     another. He also cares for His body, and feeds it and makes it
                     grow. Christ is the source of its existence.
                       From comparisons with other scriptures, two more meanings
                     of the headship of Christ emerge. One is that Christ is the
                     supreme Leader of the church. To belong to the body of Jesus
                     Christ really means to follow Him, to obey His commandments,
                     and to keep His faith. All other powers in our lives have ceased
                     to exist. If the church is the body of Christ, then it cannot be
                     captive to any other force or seek support from any other power.
                       Another meaning is that the members of the body are His
                     people. (See 1 Peter 2:9; Titus 2:14.) Christ, the Head, means:
                     The church is His very own.

                      What are the consequences of recognizing Christ as the
                     Head of the church? Col. 1:18-22.

                        Do we dare to say: As the Head is, so is His body? The
                     consequence of having Christ as the Head means that the whole
                     life of the church must be consistent with, and a reflection of,
                     the life of Jesus Christ. By bearing the name of its Head and
                     Founder the church must, indeed, reflect the mind, love, and
                     will of Him who has chosen us.

THINK IT THROUGH       What does the name "Christian" mean to me?

                       "'To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my
                     throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my
                     Father in his throne.'
                       "These are the words of our Substitute and Surety. He who is
                     the divine Head of the church, the mightiest of conquerors,
                     would point His followers to His life, His toils, His self-denials,
                     His struggles and sufferings ... that they might be encouraged
                     to press on toward the mark for the prize and reward of the

                                                                        July 18

           Parl 2   "By one Spirit are we all baptized into one body .          ; and
          BY HIS have been all made to drink into one Spirit" (1 Cor. 12:13).
          SPIRIT
                    From the Gospels we know that Christ, the Head of the body,
                  came in the power of the Spirit, that He witnessed to the pres-
                  ence of the Spirit, and was sustained in temptation and agony
                  by the Spirit. His body, the church, likewise could not exist
                  without the Spirit. In fact, it was not until the Spirit was poured
                  out that the church could begin to function. (See Acts 2.) It is
                  through the Spirit that Christ reigns supreme in His church and
                  makes the church His instrument to finish the work that He
                  Himself began. Without the Spirit, the body is a corpse. "If any
                  man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his" (Rom. 8:9).
                  Without the Spirit, there is no church!

                    What is the role of the Spirit in the church? John 16:7-15;
                   Acts 1:8; 1 Cor. 12:1-13.

                     The church exists by the Holy Spirit. He guides the church
                   into all truth and welds the individual believers into a genuine
                   fellowship. (See 2 Cor. 13:14; Eph. 4:3-6.) The Spirit energizes
                   and vitalizes the church (Rom. 8:9-11) and seals our salvation
                   (Eph. 1:13, 14). The ministry in the church is performed through
                   the gifts of the Spirit. (See 1 Corinthians 12.) All witnessing and
                   proclamation are done in the power of the Holy Spirit (Acts 1:8;
                   1 Cor. 2:4). He also sends out missionaries and directs them
                   (Acts 13:2, 4).

                     Are there ways in which the church may actually encourage
                   the infilling of the Spirit? Acts 5:32. (See also Acts 2:1.)

                     The Holy Spirit cannot be manipulated or in any way con-
                   trolled; but His people can certainly prepare the way for His
                   power to be manifest through them.

THINK IT THROUGH      Is my church ready for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit?

                        "The lapse of time has wrought no change in Christ's parting
                    promise to send the Holy Spirit as His representative. It is not
                    because of any restriction on the part of God that the riches of
                    His grace do not flow earthward to men. If the fulfillment of the
                    promise is not seen as it might be, it is because the promise is
                    not appreciated as it should be. If all were willing, all would be
                    filled with the Spirit"— The Acts of the Apostles, p. 50.

          Part 3   "So all of us, united with Christ, form one body, serving
         UNITED individually as limbs and organs to one another" (Rom. 12:5,
     WITH CHRIST NEB).

                      Most communities we know are based on ties of blood rela-
                   tionship, residence, common ideals, interests, or goals. The
                   body of Christ is a group of people that find their unity in the
                   members' communion with the living Person, Jesus Christ. The
                   church is the body of this Person, consisting of all those who
                   through the baptism of the Spirit are united with Christ.

                     How are believers united with Christ? 1 Cor. 12:12, 13.

                     What is the nature of the relationship between Christ and
                   each of His followers? John 15:4-7, 10, 16.

                      "A union with Christ by living faith is enduring; every other
                   union must perish. Christ first chose us, paying an infinite price
                   for our redemption; and the true believer chooses Christ as first
                   and last and best in everything. But this union costs us some-
                   thing. It is a union of utter dependence, to be entered into by a
                   proud being. All who form this union must feel their need of the
                   atoning blood of Christ. They must have a change of heart. They
                   must submit their own will to the will of God... .
                      "Believers become one in Christ, but one branch cannot be
                   sustained by another. The nourishment must be obtained
                   through the vital connection with the vine. We must feel our
                   utter dependence on Christ. We must live by faith on the Son of
                   God. That is the meaning of the injunction: 'Abide in Me.' The
                   life we live in the flesh is not to the will of men, not to please our
                   Lord's enemies, but to serve and honor Him who loved us and
                   gave Himself for us. A mere assent to this union, while the
                   affections are not detached from the world, its pleasures and its
                   dissipations, only emboldens the heart in disobedience."—

THINK IT THROUGH     How does a union with Christ manifest itself?

                     "The life of the vine will be manifest in fragrant fruit on the
                   branches. 'He that abideth in Me,' said Jesus, 'and I in him, the
                   same bringeth forth much fruit: for without Me ye can do noth-
                   ing.' When we live by faith on the Son of God, the fruits of the

The Body of Christ       LESSON 4 .                             ❑ Wednesday
                                                                     July 20

         Part 4   "Just as in a single human body there are many limbs and
    MEMBERS OF organs, all with different functions, so all of us, united with
    ONE ANOTHER Christ, form one body, serving individually as limbs and or-
                gans to one another" (Rom. 12:4, 5, NEB).

                      Called into a fellowship with Jesus Christ, we are at the same
                   time called to become members of one another.

                    What does the apostle Paul say about the relationship of the
                   members of the body of Christ to each other? 1 Cor. 12:24-27;
                   Eph. 4:25.

                      The church is the body of Christ. As the operation of the
                   human body demands the cooperation and interdependence of
                   all its limbs and organs, so the body of Christ demands mutual-
                   ity. The church is not just a number of individual believers, each
                   of whom in his own way is relafed to Christ. No! By using the
                   image of the body, the Scripture emphasizes that the church is a
                   corporate personality, one unit, one indivisible whole, in which
                   each member participates in the life of the other. If one member
                   suffers, all suffer. If one member has reasons for rejoicing, the
                   others share in his joy. There are no separated individuals in the
                   church which is the body of Christ. Individualism is the very
                   opposite of the biblical concept of the church as one body.

                      In what ways does the unity of the church become man-
                   ifest? 1 Cor. 10:16, 17; Heb. 10:24, 25; 1 John 4:10, 11; John
                   17:20-23.

                      In meeting together for worshiping the one Lord, the Head of
                   the body; in breaking bread together, thereby sharing in the one
                   body of Christ; in reciprocal love and respect for one another,
                   the unity of the one body becomes manifest, to the believers and
                   the unbelievers alike. There is no room for inequality in the
                   church, or discrimination of any kind. "Baptized into union with
                   him, you have all put on Christ as a garment. There is no such
                   thing as Jew and Greek, slave and freeman, male and female; for
                   you are all one person in Christ Jesus" (Gal. 3:27, 28, NEB).

THINK IT THROUGH     How can I contribute to the unity of my church?

                      "As a people, we lose much by lack of sympathy and sociabil-
                   ity with one another. He who talks of independence and shuts
                   himself up to himself is not filling the position that God de-
                   signed he should. We are children of God, mutually dependent
                   upon one another for happiness."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 71.

           Pail 5     "The body is not one member, but many" (1 Cor. 12:14).
        UNITY IN
       DIVERSITY       Equally significant with the teaching that all members of the
                    body are a unity is the fact that the body is composed of diverse
                    members. As the physical body is not composed of one single
                    organ only, but of many, and all of these members are different,
                    in function, in strength, in honor (1 Cor. 12:17-24), so we should
                    accept and encourage a similar rich variation among the mem-
                    bers of the body of Christ, recognizing that all of these are
                    necessary to the one body.
                       At the present day the church is established in a large variety
                    of cultures and in many different economic, social, and political
                    conditions. Thus church uniformity is impossible. We must
                    promote unity, not uniformity. This unity manifests itself in the
                    internal unity of one faith and one.hope. It is not manifested in
                    the same ways of doing things, but in having the same goals for
                    which the'church has been called into existence. (See 1 Cor.
                    12:5, 6.)

                      At what point does diversity become disruptive to the unity
                    of the one body?

                       The body of Christ is one. (See 1 Cor. 12:12.) As soon as a
                    member or a group of members—from local church to groups
                    of local churches—makes claims over and against the whole
                    body, the diversity clearly disrupts the unity of the body. At that
                    point the diversity changes its quality: It becomes a sinful divi-
                    sion. In the same way as unity should not cancel out diversity, so
                    diversity should not overrule the unity of the church. The variety
                    of forms and thought, of service and work, does not exist for its
                    own good, but for the upbuilding of the one body. (See Eph.
                    4:12.) Through this one goal, individuals are related to the local
                    community, and local communities to the one church, the body
                    of Christ.

THINK IT THROUGH      How can the diversity in my church best relate to the unity of
                    the whole body of Christ?

                      "If God's professed people would receive the light as it shines
                    upon them from His word, they would reach that unity for which
                    Christ prayed, that which the apostle describes, 'the unity of the
                    Spirit in the bond of peace.' "—The Great Controversy, p. 379.

                                                                              July 22

           Part 6    "Bonded and knit together by every constituent joint, the
        GROWING whole frame grows through the due activity of each part, and
       TOGETHER builds itself up in love" (Eph. 4:16, NEB).
       IN CHRIST
                     The illustration of the body suggests a living organism, puls-
                  ing with life, vitality, creativity, and warmth. It is always growing.
                  If it does not, it is dead.

                      What makes the body of Christ grow? Acts 2:47; Col. 2:19.

                       The church grows in two ways: The first is by increasing the
                    number of members in the church, an increased influence of the
                    church on its environment, and a building up of its structures,
                    departments, and organizations. The second is spiritual
                    growth: an increase in Christian stature and maturity, in holi-
                    ness and perfection, in knowledge and understanding of truth.
                    It means growing up in Christ, in the faith, and in missionary
                    spirit and involvement. This growth comes from Christ, the
                    Head of the church, who uses each member as a channel to
                    nourish and feed the whole body.

                      What responsibility rests on the church, the body of Christ?
                    2 Cor. 5:14 through 6:2.

                      Evangelism in the New Testament church was the natural
                    function of a living organism, the body as a whole. It was the
                    outcome of a new life. Evangelism was the purpose for which
                    the church existed. Mission is not a specialized or part-time
                    activity of a few. It includes all the members in the church and
                    everything the church does. Mission and evangelism, given by
                    the Head of the church, nourish the fellowship of the believers.
                    All too little attention has been given to this nourishing which
                    results in the spiritual growth of the whole fellowship.

THINK IT THROUGH      How can I contribute to the growth of the body as a whole?

                      "When Jesus ascended to heaven, He committed His work on
                    earth to those who had received the light of the gospel. They
                    were to carry the work forward to completion. He has provided
                    no other agency for the promulgation of His truth. 'Go ye into all
                    the world, and preach the gospel to every creature."And, lo, I
                    am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.' This solemn
                    commission reaches us in this age. God leaves with His church
                    the responsibility of receiving or rejecting it."—Christian Ser-

                                                                                  July 24

           Part 1     "He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he
           FAITH    that believeth not shall be damned" (Mark 16:16).

                      What is the relationship described in the book of Acts be-
                    tween baptism and believing (faith)? Acts 16:30-33.

                       Faith and baptism are inseparably joined in the New Testa-
                    ment. Faith is a prerequisite of baptism. All people have been
                    called into the covenant relationship with God. Only those who
                    acknowledge for themselves the work that Christ has done for
                    them, and in them, accept it and permit the Spirit to permeate
                    their whole life and thought, are to enter the church through
                    baptism. The effectiveness of baptism does not depend on the
                    ritual itself, but on the faith of the one who is baptized. Faith is
                    the means of receiving the salvation offered in the gospel. And
                    this not as a work of man, but is the free gift of God. Faith itself is
                    created in the heart by the Holy Spirit. It is this faith that also
                    creates in human beings the desire to be baptized.

                      What is the nature of faith that leads to salvation? Luke 8:47,
                    48; Matt. 8:5-10.

                       Saving faith means much more than the acceptance of be-
                    liefs, although it includes belief of biblical teachings. It is a
                    relationship of trust in which the person gives his whole self to
                    Jesus Christ. That relationship expresses itself in many ways. In
                    words and acts we acknowledge that Jesus Christ is the Son of
                    God and the Lord of our life. We praise Him and worship Him,
                    and we express our gratitude for His continuing ministry in
                    heaven in our behalf. It is the basis also of our joyful expectation
                    of His soon return. The closer that relationship, the greater also
                    our love and our obedience, our total surrender and our humil-
                    ity. It is that faith that leads a person to say, "I am dead, yet I live.
                    But it is not I; Christ lives in me." (See Gal. 2:20.)

                      Since faith is so important in God's salvation, how does a
                    person come to faith? Rom. 10:11-17.

                      God has called the church into existence as an instrument by
                    which people may come to faith, and increase and express it.
                    The church affects the faith of people in three main ways: (1) the
                    proclamation and the teaching of the word of God; (2) service
                    and charity; and (3) fellowship. None of these, however, can
                    work independently of the others.

                    Christ?

         Part 2   "Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every
     REPENTANCE one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of
                sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost" (Acts
                2:38).

                     The person who is confronted with Jesus Christ and enters
                   into a relationship with Him will see himself as he really is—a
                   sinner. By faith he sees the love of God and experiences His
                   goodness. He becomes aware of God's holiness and longsuffer-
                   ing. A genuine sorrow is aroused in him, and he longs for
                   forgiveness and a new beginning. This is what the Bible calls
                   repentance.

                    What is the relationship between repentance and baptism?
                   Mark 1:4, 5; Acts 2:38.

                     It is by faith and repentance that the washing away of our sins
                   is effected. This is symbolized by baptism.

                     What leads a person to repentance? Rom. 2:4.

                     It is the law of God that convinces us of sin. But it is the
                   goodness of the Lord, the experience of His rich mercy, that
                   leads the sinner to repentance.
                     "There are many who fail to understand the true nature of
                   repentance. Multitudes sorrow that they have sinned and even
                   make an outward reformation because they fear that their
                   wrongdoing will bring suffering upon themselves. But this is not
                   repentance in the Bible sense. They lament the suffering rather
                   than the sin."—Steps to Christ, p. 23.

                     Ho4 is repentance related to the forgiveness of sins? Acts
                   5:31.

                     "It is true that repentance does precede the forgiveness of
                   sins; for it is only the broken and contrite heart that will feel the
                   need of a Saviour. But must the sinner wait till he has repented
                   before he can come to Jesus? Is repentance to be made an
                   obstacle between the sinner and the Saviour?
                     "The Bible does not teach that the sinner must repent before
                   he can heed the invitation of Christ, 'Come unto Me, all ye that
                   labor and are heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.' Matthew
                   11:28. It is the virtue that goes forth from Christ, that leads to
                   genuine repentance."—Steps to Christ, p. 26.

         Part 3   "If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and
     CONFESSION shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the
                dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth
                unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made
                unto salvation" (Rom. 10:9, 10).

                     Faith and repentance result in confession of Jesus by words
                   and actions. Jesus said, "Whosoever therefore shall confess me
                   before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in
                   heaven" (Matt. 10:32).
                     There is evidence that baptism in the New Testament church
                   was preceded by confession. This took two forms. People were
                   asked to tell what they believed. Such a profession of faith was
                   at the same time considered an evidence that the candidate for
                   baptism was indeed led by the Spirit of God. At the same time
                   candidates for baptism confessed their sins before God. If they
                   had wronged any person, they confessed to him also.

                    What is the source of a person's confession? 1 Cor. 12:3;
                   Matt. 16:17.

                     Nobody can truly say, "Jesus is Lord," except he is prompted
                   by the Holy Spirit. Similarly, nobody has the humility to say to his
                   neighbor, "I am sorry," unless the Spirit of Christ moves him.

                     How important is confession of sin in a Christian's life?
                   Prov. 28:13; 1 John 1:9.

                      "Those who have not humbled their souls before God in
                   acknowledging their guilt, have not yet fulfilled the first condi-
                   tion of acceptance. If we have not experienced that repentance
                   which is not to be repented of, and have not with true humilia-
                   tion of soul and brokenness of spirit confessed our sins, abhor-
                   ring our iniquity, we have never truly sought for the forgiveness
                   of sin."—Steps to Christ, pp. 37, 38.

                     In what way does the church today continue the New Tes-
                   tament practice of confession before baptism?

                     The Seventh-day Adventist Church Manual states: "The
                   church has a right to know concerning the faith and attitude of
                   every individual applying for church membership. It is proper
                   for a public examination of all candidates to be held prior to
                   their baptism, preferably in the presence of the church."—Pages

          Part 4  "Why tarriest thou? arise and be baptized, and wash away
        BAPTISM thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord" (Acts 22:16).

                      Faith in Jesus as Lord and Redeemer, repentance, and con-
                   fession find their visible expression in baptism. Through this
                   rite a person testifies to his union with Christ and is united with
                   His church.

                     What were the characteristics of the baptism administered
                   by John the Baptist? Mark 1:4-8.

                     Three aspects stand out clearly: It was a baptism in token of
                   repentance, the remission of sins, and in preparation for the
                   coming of the Lord. Since Christian baptism is rooted in the
                   baptism of John, these three aspects remain important also for
                   baptism today, although other significant characteristics have
                   been added.
                      Little is known with certainty about the origin of the baptism
                   of John. The Jews knew of ritual washings, but these were of a
                   different nature. The same is also true of the ritual washings of
                   the sect at Qumran. Baptism was practiced as a means of receiv-
                   ing proselytes to Judaism. But in that rite the proselytes washed
                   themselves, whereas in the baptism of the New Testament
                   people are being washed, a significant difference indeed!
                   Through baptism John was gathering a community that was
                   waiting for the coming of the Messiah. Baptism of water would
                   then be given an additional meaning through the baptism by fire
                   and the Spirit. (See Luke 3:16.)

                     Why did Jesus desire to be baptized? Matt. 3:13-17.

                     At first John refused to baptize Jesus. After all, Jesus was the
                   "mightier one" who would baptize with the Holy Spirit. John
                   saw in Him the coming Messiah, and he could not reconcile with
                   his own conception of the Messiah the idea that the Messiah
                   should be baptized with a "baptism of repentance for the remis-
                   sion of sins." Jesus knew no sin (2 Cor. 5:21). John must have
                   understood, however, when a voice from heaven said: "Thou art
                   my beloved Son, in thee I am well pleased" (Luke 3:22). These
                   words were in fulfillment of Psalm 18:20-24 and Isaiah 42 which
                   speak of the coming of the Messiah. At His baptism Jesus
                   accepted His role as the Messiah, indicating, however, that His
                   work would be accomplished through suffering and death. (See
                   Luke 12:50.) With this role God was well pleased, and God
                   confirmed it by sending on Jesus the fullness of His Spirit to
                   accomplish His difficult missioni(See Luke 4:1.)

            Part 5   "As many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put
        BURIAL AND on Christ" (Gal. 3:27).
     RESURRECTION
                     Baptism means doing away with one way of life and putting
                   on another.

                       What meanings of baptism are stressed in Romans 6: 3-5?

                       It is significant that on the two occasions when Jesus spoke of
                    His death He referred to it as a baptism. "I have a baptism to be
                    baptized with; and how am I straitened until it be ac-
                    complished!" (Luke 12:50; see also Mark 10:38, 39.) The word
                    translated here as "accomplished" is from the same Greek root
                    as the word "finished" in John 19:30, where Jesus says: "It is
                    finished." Jesus, our Redeemer, has accomplished His work
                    through death. And all who are baptized in union with Him, need
                    not die anymore! Our baptism is our burial. This has a double
                    meaning: (1) The death of Jesus stands instead of our own
                    eternal death (Rom. 6:23); and (2) the death of the nature we had
                    before we knew Jesus Christ. But our baptism is at the same
                    time our resurrection, again in a double meaning: (1) In union
                    with Christ we have eternal life (John 11:21-27), and (2) we live
                    a, new life that shows the fruits of the Spirit of Christ.

                      What mode of baptism best symbolizes the meaning of
                    baptism given in Colossians 2:12? (See also Acts 8:38, 39.)

                       In the New Testament one of the meanings of the Greek word
                    baptismos is "immersion." John the Baptist chose a place in the
                    Jordan where there was much water (John 3:23). The only form
                    of baptism requiring much water is immersion. This symbolized
                    man's totally lost condition before God, as well as his complete
                    cleansing. AfterJesus' death and resurrection, the idea of dying
                    and being resurrected to a new life was best symbolized by
                    immersion. The same applies to the meaning of washing. The
                    words "washing," or "washing away," are used parallel to
                    "baptize." (See Acts 22:16; Eph. 5:26.) When in later years the
                    practice of pouring and sprinkling became a rule, the idea of
                    washing was discarded. Though the effect of baptism does not
                    lie in the rite itself, but in the faith of the believer, the mode of
                    baptism by immersion remains very significant in light of Jesus'
                    own baptism, the New Testament practice, and the biblical
                    meaning of the rite.

                    rection been in my life?

          Part 6  "According to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of
        REBIRTH regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost" (Titus 3:5).

                      The resurrection to a new life with Christ (Romans 6; Col.
                   2:9-15) has also been described as a new birth. (See 1 Peter 1:3.)
                   It is not a result of water baptism, but of a conscious turning
                   away from the old life and a turning toward Christ, with whom
                   the believer becomes united. But the water is important, since it
                   indicates that the new birth is not a result of the will of man, but
                   of the grace of God.

                     By what means Is the new birth accomplished? John 3:6-8.

                     The new birth is new because it is generated by the Holy
                   Spirit. Through this new birth ordinary human beings become
                   children of God. A new family is created, with its own life-style,
                   characteristics, and name. This is the church. It is not merely a
                   gathering of born-again individuals; it is a family, in which we
                   are all brothers and sisters. We are not only united to the one
                   Head, Jesus Christ; we are also united with one another.

                     Who is associated with the rite of baptism? 1 Cor. 12:13.

                     In the New Testament the giving of the Holy Spirit is as-
                   sociated with baptism. It was at His baptism that Jesus received
                   the Holy Spirit, ordaining Him thereby to His mission as the
                   Messiah. Jesus' baptism was a model for all later baptisms. It is
                   at baptism that believers receive the gift of the Spirit. Through
                   this gift baptism becomes the believers' consecration to the
                   service of Jesus Christ.
                      The baptism in the name of the triune God is pointing not only
                   at the future when those who are baptized will share forever in
                   the glory of Christ. The believer has already been given his
                   inheritance of salvation in Christ, the bounty of God's grace. His
                   sins have been washed away indeed; his salvation is sure. The
                   Holy Spirit has been given as a down payment and as a seal.
                   Through baptism we are united in fellowship with Christ and
                   with His people whom He is preparing for His glorious arrival.

THINK IT THROUGH     In light of the biblical meaning of baptism, what can the
                   church do to make it more meaningful in the lives of the
                   believers, individually and corporately?

                   mother" (Gal. 4:25, 26, NEB).

                     Literal Israel is often depicted in the Scriptures by Jerusalem,
                   the Holy City, built on solid rock and with walls behind which the
                   people could find refuge. It is the City of David and of his royal
                   descendants, the center of the world where all the nations
                   would come to worship the only true God and find salvation. All
                   these meanings have been transposed to the "heavenly
                   Jerusalem" representing the church.

                   Hebrews 12:22-24?

                      Jerusalem is the city of the Messiah. It is the place where God
                   dwells, where salvation is to be found, and where His chosen
                   people live. This city has two forms: an earthly, the church, and
                   a heavenly, which is the model of the church and the hope of
                   the believers. The citizens of this city have the name of God on
                   their foreheads (Rev. 3:12), a sign that they belong to God and
                   to each other in a sacred fellowship.
                      In Jerusalem there was also the temple of God with the ark
                   where the commandments of God were kept. This pictures the
                   church as God's channel of grace and as His holy people who
                   observe His commandments.
                      "The church is the repository of the riches of the grace of
                   Christ; and through the church will eventually be made man-
                   ifest, even to 'the principalities and powers in heavenly places,'
                   the final and full display of the love of God."— The Acts of the
                   Apostles, p. 9.

                     What is the great opposite of Jerusalem, and what does it
                   stand for? Rev. 14:8; 17:5, 6.

                      From all the descriptions given of Babylon, it is clear that this
                   mysterious name (Rev. 17:5) denotes the very opposite of God's
                   church. Instead of relying on God and giving glory to Him, it is
                   arrogant and proud, wicked and sinful; it relies on its own
                   strength and power and persecutes those who want to remain
                   loyal to the faith of Jesus and keep His commandments. It
                   stands under the judgment of God, who urges His people, there-
                   fore, to leave that city (Rev. 18:4), to give up all unfaithfulness
                   and sin, and return to the Holy City of God.

THINK IT THROUGH     Who really constitute Babylon today, and what are the
                   hallmarks of God's holy city?

                                                                           August 1

          Part 2   "Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his
           SALT savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for
                 nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of
                 men" (Matt. 5:13).

                    What is the meaning of salt as an illustration of the church?
                   Matt. 5:13. (See also Mark 9:50; Luke 14:34.)

                       From the texts and the contexts in which they are given, three
                   functions of the church stand out clearly: It is called to season
                   the world, to preserve it, and to purify it.
                       What is meant by salt losing its saltness? In the Old Testament
                   ritual services salt was added to every sacrifice. (See Lev. 2:13;
                   Eze. 43:24.) Without salt the sacrifices were unacceptable. Here
                   the salt stands for the righteousness of Christ. "Referring to this
                   practice, Jesus said, 'Every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.'
                   'Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another.' All
                   who would present themselves 'a living sacrifice, holy, accept-
                   able unto God' (Rom. 12:1), must receive the saving salt, the
                   righteousness of our Saviour. Then they become 'the salt of the
                   earth,' restraining evil among men, as salt preserves from cor-
                   ruption. Matt. 5:13. But if the salt has lost its savor; if there is
                   only a profession of godliness, without the love of Christ, there
                   is no power for good. The life can exert no saving influence
                   upon the world. Your energy and efficiency in the upbuilding of
                   My kingdom, Jesus says, depend upon your receiving of My
                    Spirit. You must be partakers of My grace, in order to be a savor
                    of life unto life. Then there will be no rivalry, no self-seeking, no
                    desire for the highest place. You will have that love which seeks
                    not her own, but another's wealth."—The Desire of Ages, p. 439.
                        Christ's illustration of the salt suggests a method of
                    evangelism. "Salt must be mingled with the substance to which
                    it is added; it must penetrate and infuse in order to preserve. So
                    it is through personal contact and association that men are
                    reached by the saving power of the gospel. They are not saved in
                    masses, but as individuals. Personal influence is a power. We
                    must come close to those whom we desire to benefit."—

                                                                        August 2

          Part 3   "[Ye] are built upon the foundation of the apostles and
          GOD'S prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone; in
        BUILDING whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an
                 holy temple in the Lord: in whom ye also are builded together
                 for an habitation of God through the Spirit" (Eph. 2:20-22).

                      What aspects of the church are emphasized in the illustra-
                   tion of the church as a building? 1 Cor. 3:10, 11;1 Peter 2:4-6.

                      A building stresses the visibility of the church and its con-
                   tinuity, strength, and unity. The church is not a building com-
                   pleted. It is in process of construction. Only the Foundation and
                   the Cornerstone are laid forever.

                     What does the Bible teach us concerning the building pro-
                   cess? Eph. 2:20-22; 1 Peter 2:5.

                      From the beginning to the end the construction of the build-
                   ing is the work of God. It is He who gave the contract; He also
                   drew the plans and laid the foundation. Yes, even the stones
                   themselves are first made by Him before they are laid upon the
                   foundation and are fitted together.
                      What is the human contribution in the building process? The
                   Greek word used for "building," can also be translated "edifica-
                   tion." Whatever edifies the believers builds the church. The
                   Greek construction in Ephesians 4:12 indicates that the pur-
                   pose of apostles and other gifts is to prepare the saints for
                   service and edification. Thus edification is a ministry that falls
                   upon all the believers alike. It takes place when we love one
                   another. Love is the cement that binds us together and is man-
                   ifested in worship and fellowship, in mission and evangelism, in
                   daily life and in charity. Where people edify one another, there
                   the church is alive and growing.

THINK IT THROUGH    What is the relationship between the individual believer as
                   God's temple, and the church as God's holy building?

                     "The Christian who faithfully presents the word of life, lead-
                   ing men and women into the way of holiness and peace, is
                   bringing to the foundation material that will endure, and in the
                   kingdom of God he will be honored as a wise builder. . . .
                     "Christ has given to the church a sacred charge. Every
                   member should be a channel through which God can com-
                   municate to the world the treasures of His grace, the unsearch-
                   able riches of Christ. There is nothing that the Saviour desires
                   so much as agents who will represent to the world His Spirit and
                   His character."—The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 599, 600.

Called Out-To Go In        LESSON 6                              ❑ Wednesday
                                                                    August 3

          Part 4   "The kingdom of Heaven is like yeast, which a woman took
          YEAST and mixed with half a hundredweight of flour till it was all
                 leavened" (Matt. 13:33, NEB).

                      The characteristic of yeast is that it works quietly and unob-
                   trusively. Yet it permeates the whole dough and gives shape to
                   the whole bread. Yeast identifies itself with the lump, but in
                   doing so it slowly changes the character of the whole lump.
                   Yeast represents thewaythe Holy Spirit works in the human life;
                   but it also teaches how the church, on receiving the Spirit, is to
                   work in society. (See The Adventist Home, p. 33.)

                     In what ways does the church as yeast balance the church
                   as the building of God? Matt. 13:33; 2 Cor. 6:14-17.

                      The emphasis in the view of the church as God's building is
                   that God's people must be different from the world. They must
                   separate themselves from unbelievers, and be built into a holy
                   community that stands apart from the secular activities and
                   interests of the world. This aspect of the church can hardly be
                   overstressed.
                      Yet in the image of the yeast we are introduced to another
                   mode of being in the world as God's church: not isolation and
                   separation, but involvement and infusion, participation and
                   penetration. The church can be the yeast only when it identifies
                   itself with the world's needs and interests, as Christ did. In the
                   New Testament the church worked as yeast in human institu-
                   tions, reaching even into the emperor's palace. So today the
                   members of the church are called to bear this witness in secular
                   affairs and institutions. As Ellen White said, "The followers of
                   Christ are to be separate from the world in principles and inter-
                   ests, but they are not to isolate themselves from the world."—
                   Counsels to Teachers, p. 323.
                      These two views of the church have to be kept in balance.
                    When the church emphasizes only the model of the temple, it
                    tends to become concerned only about its own holiness; it
                    becomes isolated from the world, much like Israel in the days of
                    Christ. On the other hand, if only the model of the salt and the
                    yeast are stressed, the church stands in danger of becoming so
                    much identified with the world that it loses its identity. The salt
                    becomes saltless. It is in the balance between the two that the
                    church can really be the church after the divine pattern.

THINK IT THROUGH     How could the balance between these two illustrations best
                   be facilitated in the church?

Called Out-To Go In        LESSON 6                                ❑ Thursday
                                                                     August 4

          Part 5  "Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy
         A HOLY nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the
         NATION praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his
                 marvellous light" (1 Peter 2:9).

                      Frequently in the New Testament the church is referred to by
                   the names used for Israel in the Old Testament. The term "holy
                   nation" is an example. Among all the nations on earth God had
                   one nation that He set apart for His own purpose. Now the
                   church is God's "holy nation." It has become holy through the
                   death of our Redeemer. (See Eph. 5:25, 26.) For that reason the
                   New Testament speaks of the members of the church as saints,
                   that is, persons who are holy.
                      What does the term "holy" mean in connection with the
                   church? Christ sanctified a special people for the express pur-
                   pose of witnessing in the world. First, saints are all those who
                   are sent out by Christ who has sanctified them. Second, saints
                   are people on whom the Holy Spirit has fallen. Third, this holy
                   fellowship means that saints do not defraud one another; they
                   are willing to be defrauded rather than become involved in
                   disputes that demonstrate the absence of the standards of the
                   kingdom of God. Finally, sainthood means a moral perfection, a
                   holiness of character that is completed "in the fear of the Lord"
                   (2 Cor. 7:1). This state of holiness is accomplished by present-
                   ing our bodies daily as a holy sacrifice (Rom. 12:1) or by putting
                   on the new humanity (Col. 3:10). To be saints, the members of
                   the church must act as saints, with compassion, meekness,
                   patience, forgiveness, obedience, and love. (See 1 Peter 1:14-
                   16.)
                     It is noteworthy that the term "holy" is almost never used in
                   the singular as referring only to an individual member of the
                   church. Holiness refers to the community, the church, as a
                   whole. To be a saint is to become a participant in what the
                   church as a whole stands for.

                     How can the church reach the state of perfect holiness?

                   to represent Him in thought, word, and deed. . . . Their every

                                                                        August 5

          Part 6   "These all died in faith, not having received the promises,
         ALIENS but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them,
      AND EXILES and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers
                 and pilgrims on the earth" (Heb. 11:13).

                      The image of the holy nation represents the church as an
                   institution, stable, visible, and continuous, with its own laws,
                   language, and behavior. The concept of the church as a group
                   of aliens and exiles living scattered abroad, emphasizes the
                   pilgrim nature of the church and its foreignness in this world.

                    How are believers exiles and pilgrims In their own world?
                   Heb. 11:9-16.

                     Everyone who is a member of God's chosen people thereby
                   becomes a pilgrim in his own culture and country, all his life.
                   (See 1 Peter 2:11.)
                     The reason for this foreignness of the church in each country
                   and culture is that we can no longer give final authority to any
                   earthly power. As Christians we honor our government, but we
                   do not worship it. And if we honor our government, obey the
                   rules of the country, and accept its culture and traditions, it is
                   because we first honor God and worship Him. Members of the
                   family of God can never give unconditional loyalty to any earthly
                   society, because their first citizenship is in heaven. "This is
                   cause for great joy, even though now you smart for a little while"
                   (1 Peter 1:6, NEB).

                     What warning given by Jesus to His disciples Indicates the
                   risk of living as aliens and strangers in the world? Matt.
                   10:16-18.

                      Any society resents those strangers in its midst who do not
                   join in worshiping the popular idols, or in detesting those whom
                   society discriminates against.

THINK IT THROUGH     What is the relationship between loyalty to God, witnessing
                   to His name, and persecution?

                     "No man can serve God without enlisting against himself the
                   opposition of the hosts of darkness. Evil angels will assail him,
                   alarmed that his influence is taking the prey from their hands.
                   Evil men, rebuked by his example, will unite with them in seek-
                   ing to separate him from God by alluring temptations. When
                   these do not succeed, then a compelling power is employed to
                   force the conscience."—The Great Controversy, p. 610.

     THE ASSEMBLY good works: not forsaking the assembling of ourselves to-
                  gether, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another:
                  and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching" (Heb.
                  10:24, 25).

                      Assembling together, the believers are strengthened in their
                    Christian experience through the outpouring of God's grace.
                    Ellen White claims that "God teaches us that we should assem-
                    ble in His house to cultivate the attributes of perfect love."—In
                    Heavenly Places, p. 288.

                      What is the purpose of the assembly? Matt. 18:20.

                      The gathering of the believers is not merely an organizational
                    aspect of the church. The assembly is the place where God and
                    man meet. Here the covenant relationship is reaffirmed again
                    and again. As one body God's people sense in a special way the
                    presence of the Lord and are asked to give a response to His
                    grace. God uses the assembly in a special way to pour out His
                    blessings upon His people and He accepts their renewed dedi-
                    cation and worship as an expression of their love and obedi-
                    ence to Him. To that end God has set aside a special day—the
                    seventh day—on which He would meet with His people. Four
                    aspects of the assembly on the Sabbath day deserve special
                    attention: (1) The believers express their recognition of God as
                    their Creator and as their Lord (see Mark 2:27, 28); (2) They
                    express their gratitude for having been redeemed out of their
                    house of bondage into a state of freedom and joy and peace
                    (Deut. 5:15); they also express their joy over the covenant of
                    which the Sabbath is a sign and a seal (Eze. 20:12, 20); (3)
                    together the believers express their sorrow over their sins, to
                    which God responds in compassion and grace, forgiving even
                    their iniquities; and (4) the believers are reminded of the fact
                    that their gathering on the Sabbath day is an anticipation of
                    fellowship to be enjoyed in the eternal rest. (See Heb. 4:1-11.)

                      What are some of the means given the gathering of believ-
                    ers to express their relationship with God and with one
                    another? 1 Cor. 11:26; Rom. 10:9,10; Col. 3:16, 17; 1 Tim. 2:1, 2.

                      The assembly is not only an expression of man's service to
                    God, but also a channel of God's grace to man and a means of
                    establishing fellowship with one another. The assembly is an
                    expression of the communion of the saints, the oneness of all
                    the believers as the body of Christ.

THINK IT THROUGH      In what way can I contribute to build the church through the
                    assembly?

To Build Up the Church          LESSON 7                              ❑ Monday
                                                                         August 8

           Part 2     "Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in
 THE INSTRUCTION    the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:
                    teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have com-
                    manded you" (Matt. 28:19, 20).

                      After a person has been taught, baptized, and brought into
                    union with Christ, further instruction is needed. This will help
                    him to grow in the faith and to strengthen his relationship with
                    Christ. To that end the church has been given the commission
                    to teach after baptism as well as before. It is a channel of grace
                    by which the believer grows in the Spirit and in truth. It is a
                    means by which he grows into that perfect union with Christ and
                    in the fellowship with the other members of the body of Christ.

                      What is the nature of the ongoing instruction of the believ-
                    ers? Matt. 28:19; John 17:17; 2 Tim. 4:1, 2.

                       It is clear that the instruction the believer receives after his
                    baptism is not merely some new information, and not just an
                    exercise of the mind. It is a means by which the believer be-
                    comes aware of the grace of God in all of his life and of the many
                    ways in which he is challenged to show his allegiance to Christ.
                    It fosters sanctification; it stimulates and empowers the believer
                    to grow into the stature of Christ and be recreated into the
                    image of God. After his baptism the believer is suddenly faced
                    with problems of Christian living and challenges to his Christian
                    experience that need to be solved and answered. He is faced
                    with social issues and economic problems, with poverty and
                    pollution, race relations and social discrimination, the chal-
                    lenge of culture and new developments in society, marriage,
                    and the family. What are the biblical answers to these problems
                     of life? How can a believer live a Christian life amid the many
                     influences of his environment? This is the nature of the instruc-
                     tion by which the believer learns "to observe all things what-
                     soever I have commanded you." It is an ongoing means of
                    grace.

THINK IT THROUGH      In what ways is the church accomplishing this divine ordi-
                    nance of instruction? How does a believer become an instruc-
                    tor?

                      In the light of Scripture the Sabbath School must be viewed as
                    more than the church at study. It is a means of consecration,
                    sanctification, and Christian growth.
                       "The Sabbath school, if rightly conducted, is one of God's
                    great instrumentalities to bring souls to a knowledge of the
                    truth."—Counsels on Sabbath School Work, p. 115.

          Part 3  "So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word
     THE SERMON of God" (Rom. 10:17).

                      Although it is difficult to ascertain the precise pattern of the
                   ministry of the Word in the New Testament, it clearly has a
                   central place in the gathering of the believers. In fact, so impor-
                   tant is the ministry of the Word that when other services
                   threatened to take up too much of their time, energy, and atten-
                   tion, the apostles decided to put prayer and preaching first. (See
                   Acts 6:1-5.)

                     What are the nature and the aims of the sermon? 1 Thess.
                   2:13; 2 Tim. 4:1-5.

                      Preaching is to put the believer in contact with the Word of
                   God. Through the sermon Christ becomes present in the minds
                   and hearts of the believers. As such, the sermon is an instru-
                   ment of grace by which the members are blessed and exhorted,
                   challenged and comforted, instructed and corrected, built up in
                   the faith and equipped for service. (See 2 Tim. 3:16, 17.)
                      The sermon has two important aspects: the interpretation of
                   Scripture, especially the way God has revealed Himself to man,
                   His promises, and His prophecies; and the application of the
                   Word of God to the actual situations of the believers' everyday
                   life. In that sense the sermon becomes a means of grace that
                   makes God's promise of salvation a real experience in our time
                   and circumstance.
                      "The minister who is God's ambassador and Christ's rep-
                   resentative on the earth, who humbles himself that God may be
                   exalted, will possess the genuine quality of eloquence. True
                   piety, a close connection with God, and a daily, living experi-
                   ence in the knowledge of Christ, will make eloquent even the
                   stammering tongue."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 314.
                      Ministers who are teachers, "if they are really men of God,
                   receive their words from God. Their manner of address may be
                   faulty and need much improvement; yet if God breathes
                   through them words of inspiration, the power is not of man, but
                   of God." —Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 318.
                      "God has given His ministers the message of truth to pro-
                   claim. This the churches are to receive and in every possible

To Build Up the Church         LESSON 7                          ❑ Wednesday
                                                                    August 10

       Part 4   "He then went upstairs, broke bread and ate, and after
  CONVERSATION much conversation, which lasted until dawn, he departed"
              (Acts 20:11, NEB).

                     Already in Jesus' own ministry the conversation with one or a
                   few people was a very significant means of leading people into a
                   union with Him. Christ has left us thereby an example. Through
                   such conversations during Jesus' ministry, people became
                   convinced of the truth; they became aware of their own needs,
                   and they found in them a means of expressing their faith and
                   gratitude. These conversations, moreover, created a genuine
                   fellowship between the believers. Thus the followers of Christ
                   comforted one another and strengthened each other in the
                   faith. Conversation is a genuine biblical method of ministry.

                      What are some of the effects achieved through conversa-
                   tion? Mal. 3:16; Luke 4:36, 37.

                     The Word of God is spread; people become convinced of the
                   truth; new ways are discovered of experiencing the reality of
                   salvation in our daily lives; a community spirit develops; people
                   are comforted and strengthened in the faith. Ellen White tells
                   the ministers that when they have preached their work is just
                   begun. (See Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 705.)
                      "Confirm the labor bestowed in the desk by following it up
                   with private effort. Engage in judicious conversation upon pres-
                   ent truth, candidly ascertaining the state of mind of those pres-
                   ent, and in the fear of God making a practical application of
                   important truth to the cases of those with whom you are
                   associated."—Testimonies, vol. 2, pp. 705, 706.The messenger
                   of God has stressed over and over again that all believers are
                   called to use conversation as a means to express the grace of
                   God and His truth, and to build one another in the faith. (See
                   Testimonies, vol. 1, pp. 509, 513; vol. 4 pp. 347, 348, etc.)

THINK IT THROUGH      How can the church today stimulate and facilitate conversa-
                   tion as a means of building up the church?

                      The contents of the conversation should be much like the
                   sermon and the instruction, only more personal and more di-
                   rectly associated with the individual's particular situation. Vari-

                   after-church dinners, home visitation, prayer groups, commun-
                   ity service groups, home churches, etc. The organizing of these
                   groups, however, should not be a goal in itself, but a means
                   whereby the church is built and the gospel is spread.

To Build Up the Church            LESSON 7                              El Thursday
                                                                           August 11

             Part 5   "Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is
           SERVICE this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and
                    to keep himself unspotted from the world" (James 1:27).

                       From Jesus' own ministry the church has learned that the
                     word and the deed are inseparable. The earliest church saw to it
                     that none of the believers lacked anything. (See Acts 4:34.) And
                     ever since that time the church has been an institution for
                     helping people in their needs.

                       What was included In the service rendered to people by
                     Jesus and the apostolic church? Matt. 10:8; 11:5, 6; Acts 6:1-4.

                        Note the difference of the church from a secular service
                     organization. Man is an indivisible whole, a total unit. The phys-
                     ical, social, mental, spiritual, and economic aspects of life are
                     an integrated whole. All of these together make up a person's
                     life before God. Salvation is not a matter, therefore, of the heart
                     or the soul only, or of a person's moral or spiritual life. Salvation
                     is a total experience. As long as one aspect of life has not been
                     affected by God's grace, a person is not fully helped. Healing the
                     body, feeding the hungry, supporting the poor, or visiting pris-
                     oners are therefore never isolated ends. Christian service is
                     inspired by the love of Christ, which aims at the salvation of all
                     men. Christian social action is incomplete without the procla-
                     mation of the Word and the call to repentance. But the reverse is
                     also true: Witnessing and evangelization remain sterile without
                     Christian service.

THINK IT THROUGH       Given the many service agencies in modern society, what
                     forms of Christian service would be most needed today?

                       "I saw that it is in the providence of God that widows and
                     orphans, the blind, the deaf, the lame, and persons afflicted in a
                     variety of ways, have been placed in close Christian relationship
                     to His church; it is to prove His people and develop their true
                     character. . . . If we have the true religion of the Bible we shall
                     feel that a debt of love, kindness, and interest is due to Christ in
                     behalf of His brethren."—Testimonies, vol. 3, p. 511.
                       "Good deeds are the fruit that Christ requires us, tobear: kind
                     words, deeds of benevolence, of tender regard for the poor, the
                     needy, the afflicted.... When you succor the poor, sympathize
                     with the afflicted and oppressed, and befriend the orphan, you
                     bring yourselves into a closer relationship to Jesus."—

To Build Up the Church          LESSON 7                                ❑ Friday
                                                                        August 12

          Part 6     "The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the commun-
     THE LORD'S    ion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not
        SUPPER     the communion of the body of Christ? For we being many are
                   one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one
                   bread" (1 Cor. 10:16, 17).

                      Among all the means of grace whereby believers are brought
                   into a union with Christ and with one another, none has been
                   considered so important as the Lord's Supper. The Lord's Sup-
                   per is the most comprehensive expression of Jesus Christ and
                   the salvation He has provided.

                     What is the meaning of the Lord's Supper? Matt. 26: 26-29.

                      Through the Lord's Supper two basic elements of the church
                   are realized: the union between God and man, and the union
                   among the believers. This union with Christ has clearly three
                   aspects: a past, a present, and a future. The past is represented
                   in Jesus' words: "This do ... in remembrance of me," referring
                   in the first place to His death at the cross, whereby He estab-
                   lished a new covenant with His people. Through His death our
                   sins have been forgiven and sinners have been reconciled to
                   God. The present comes to the fore in our experience of sins
                   forgiven through Jesus. The future aspect of the union is clearly
                   expressed in Jesus' words: "I will not drink henceforth of this
                   fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my
                   Father's kingdom" (Matt. 26:29). The celebration of the death of
                   Christ is not that of a funeral, but one of joy over the redemption
                   received and over the promise of an everlasting union, soon to
                   be realized.
                      The foot-washing service relates directly to the Lord's Sup-
                   per. Ellen White points out:
                      "This ordinance [foot washing] is Christ's appointed prepara-
                   tion for the sacramental service. While pride, variance, and
                   strife for supremacy are cherished, the heart cannot enter into
                   fellowship with Christ. We are not prepared to receive the com-
                   munion of His body and His blood. Therefore it was that Jesus
                   appointed the memorial of His humiliation to be first ob-
                    served. . . .
                      "To those who receive the spirit of this service, it can never
                    become a mere ceremonial. Its constant lesson will be, 'By love
                    serve one another.' Gal. 5:13."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 650,

                                                is the people who are bound together
                                                by belief in Jesus. In other circles, the
                                                church has been identified with a

                                               or with a certain office. The church
                                               fathers (Ignatius, Cyprian) expressed
                                               the view that the church consists of its
                                               bishops and clergy. The Bible teaches

                                               significance. (See Gal. 3:28.) This

        women who give of themselves in compassionate service.

           Part 1   "God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a
          GOD'S people for his name" (Acts 15:14).
         CHOSEN
         PEOPLE     Throughout the New Testament emphasis is given to the fact
                  that the church has come into existence not through the will of
                  man, but because God has chosen His own people. As Christ
                  said, "Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you" (John
                  15:16; see also verse 19).

                     What is the basis of God's choice? Deut. 7:6-8; Eph. 2:4-8.

                     God's grace is the source of everything. It is the source of our
                   personal life and existence (Acts 17:25), and of the existence of
                   the church. Grace is the love of God in action; He forgives men
                   their sins and reconciles them to Himself (2 Cor. 5:19; 8:9).
                   Grace makes it possible for the people of God to be what God
                   would like them to be, and by His grace they may be pure and
                   victorious till the end. (See Eph. 5:26, 27.)

                     What is the purpose of God's choosing? 1 Peter 2:9; Titus
                   2:14.

                      God has no favorites. (See Rom. 2:11.) He is the God of all men
                   who does not want any person lost, but who wishes that all
                   might come to a knowledge of truth (1 Tim. 2:4). As God chose
                   His special people in Old Testament times for service, so His
                   church in the New Testament is chosen for service. To make all
                   people aware of His grace and of their reconciliation to God, He
                   has chosen a special people to be the channels of His grace to
                   all men. They are the firstfruits of a large harvest from the whole
                   world. (See James 1:18; see also Rev. 14:4.) The church is called
                   as a model of what God wants all men to be. By them God
                   accomplishes His work of grace and redemption. The call to
                   become a member of God's chosen people, therefore, is a call to
                   mission and an appointment to be a minister of Christ.

THINK IT THROUGH     How do I measure up to my call into the church?

                      "It was the Saviour's purpose that after He ascended to
                   heaven to become man's intercessor, His followers should carry
                   on the work that He had begun. . . . There are some who are
                   willing to go to the ends of the earth in order to carry the light of
                   truth to men, but God demands that every soul who knows the
                   truth shall seek to win others to the love of the truth. If we are not
                   willing to make special sacrifices in order to save souls that are
                   ready to perish, how can we be counted worthy to enter into the
                   city of God?"—Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 103.

         WHOLE
                     We generally think of the church as a group of men and
                   women, each of whom has been united to Christ individually.
                   But these individuals are unified into a group by experiences
                   common to all. Each one is controlled to some extent by the
                   group if he is to remain a part of the group.

                     What illustration does Paul use to describe this oneness of
                   the people of God? Rom. 12:4, 5; 1 Cor. 12:12-14.

                      Contrary to the classical Greek writings, the Bible uses the
                   term laos, people, almost exclusively in its singular form. Laos,
                   from which our word "laity" is derived, is a single, indivisible
                   unit. God's chosen people are one unit. An individual believer is
                   never referred to in Scripture as a layman. The Bible speaks only
                   of the people—one undivided whole. And it stands for all the
                   believers in Christ, not just the "ordinary believers," a distinc-
                   tion that is foreign to Scripture.

                     What is, in Scripture, the opposite of the people of God?
                   1 Peter 2:9, 10; Rom. 9:25, 26.

                     In Scripture each people as a distinct unit has a particular
                   characteristic that distinguishes it from all other peoples.
                   Therefore, the people of God stands over and against all other
                   peoples who have not accepted Christ as their Saviour and
                   Lord.
                     "In order for the work to be built up strong and symmetrical,
                   there is need of varied gifts and different agencies, all under the
                   Lord's direction; He will instruct the workers according to their
                   several ability. Co-operation and unity are essential to a har-
                   monious whole, each laborer doing his God-given work, filling
                   his appropriate position, and supplying the deficiency of
                   another. One worker left to labor alone is in danger of thinking
                   that his talent is sufficient to make a complete whole.
                     "Where there is a union of workers, there is opportunity for
                   them to consult together, to pray together, to co-operate in
                   labor. None should feel that they cannot link up with their
                   brethren because they do not work in exactly the same line as
                   they themselves do."—Evangelism, p. 104.

                   concepts were to be more fully implemented?

The People of God         LESSON 8                                     ❑ Tuesday
                                                                          August 16

          Part 3   "Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy
      A KINGDOM nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the
      OF PRIESTS praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his
                 marvellous light" (1 Peter 2:9).

                     God called a special people in Old Testament times to be "a
                   kingdom of priests" (Ex. 19:6). His chosen people today receive
                   the same call.

                     What is the nature of the priesthood to which all the believ-
                   ers have been appointed? 1 Peter 2:5, 9; Heb. 10:19-25.

                      Under the old covenant, the priestly function was threefold:
                   to offer sacrifices, to teach the law, and to serve as intercessor
                   between God and man. (See Heb. 8:3; Deut. 33:10; Heb. 5:1.)
                   These roles have been fulfilled and taken over by Christ, our
                   great High Priest. But He has called a special people to partici-
                   pate in this threefold function on earth in behalf of all nations,
                    kindreds, tongues, and people.
                      (1) Sacrifices. The members of the church are urged to "offer
                    the sacrifice of praise to God continually" (Heb. 13:15), and to
                   do good (verse 16). The kind deeds of the believers not only
                   glorify God before men, but they are priestly acts toward God.
                   Paul calls the ministry of the gospel a "priestly service." Its
                   purpose is "that the offering of the Gentiles may be acceptable,
                    sanctified by the Holy Spirit" (Rom. 15:16, RSV).
                      (2) Teaching. God's people is a kingdom of priests "to pro-
                   claim the triumphs of him who has called you out of darkness
                   into his marvellous light" (NEB). That priestly serv-
                   ice is accomplished by being ambassadors for Christ (2 Cor.
                   5:18-20).
                      (3) Intercessor. God's people, as a kingdom of priests, are
                   called upon to offer intercessory prayers for one another, for the
                   physical and spiritual needs of people inside and outside of the
                   church, for governments, for the work of the church and its
                   mission in all the world (1 Tim. 2:1, 2).

THINK IT THROUGH     How will this biblical teaching of the priesthood of all believ-
                   ers affect my life?

                      "The Saviour's commission to the disciples included all the
                   believers. It includes all believers in Christ to the end of time....
                   All who receive the life of Christ are ordained to work for the
                   salvation of their fellow men. For this work the church was
                   established, and all who take upon themselves its sacred vows
                   are thereby pledged to be co-workers with Christ."—The Desire

The People of God        LESSON 8                                   ❑ Wednesday
                                                                       August 17

         Part 4   "As my Father hath sent me, even so send I you. And when
  ENDOWED WITH he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them,
     HIS SPIRIT Receive ye the Holy Ghost" (John 20:21, 22).

                       The hallmark of the people of God is that it is a people moved
                   by the Holy Spirit. The church was born at Pentecost. It con-
                   tinues to exist by God's presence among His people through the
                   Holy Spirit.
                       From Pentecost on, the abundance of the Spirit's activity in
                   the church is testified to in many ways. Our understanding of
                   the work of the Holy Spirit may be deepened by noting His work
                   for His people, and His work through His people.
                       For His people: The Spirit renews us (Titus 3:5) and dwells in
                   us (Rom. 8:11); He is our access to the Father (Eph. 2:18) and
                    makes intercession for us (Rom. 8:26). The Spirit is the means of
                    fellowship (Phil. 2:1) and of prayer (Eph. 6:18), of joy (1 Thess.
                    1:6) and of worship (Phil. 3:3). He is the seal of our salvation and
                    "the pledge that we shall enter upon our heritage" (Eph. 1:13,
                   14, NEB). He guides the people of God into all truth (John 16:13)
                   and helps man to confess that Christ is Lord (1 Cor. 12:3). The
                   Spirit wars against the flesh (Gal. 5:17), quickens our mortal
                    bodies (Rom. 8:11), and changes us into the image of the Lord
                    from glory to glory (2 Cor. 3:18). In short: "It is by the Spirit that
                    the heart is made pure. Through the Spirit the believer becomes
                    a partaker of the divine nature. Christ has given His Spirit as a
                    divine power to overcome all hereditary and cultivated tenden-
                    cies to evil, and to impress His own character upon His
                    church."—The Desire of Ages, p. 671.
                       Through His people: The Holy Spirit is given that men may
                    bear witness for Christ "in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in
                    Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth" (Acts 1:8). It
                    is the power of the Holy Spirit that enables His people to become
                    ministers who can bring the gospel to others (1 Peter 1:12). It is
                    when people become filled with the Holy Spirit that they begin
                     to bear witness by speaking the Word of God, through service,
                    or by a genuine fellowship and a holy life.

THINK IT THROUGH     How can the promise of the Holy Spirit become more real in
                   the life of God's people today?

                     "If all were willing, all would be filled with the Spirit. Wherever
                   the need of the Holy Spirit is a matter little thought of, there is
                   seen spiritual drought, spiritual darkness, spiritual declension
                   and death."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 50.

The People of God         LESSON 8                                    ❑ Thursday
                                                                       August 18

          Part 5    "In each of us the Spirit is manifested in one particular way,
       THE GIFTS for some useful purpose" (1 Cor. 12:7, NEB).
         OF THE
         SPIRIT     "Concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you
                 ignorant" (1 Cor. 12:1.) Each believer has been endowed with at
                 least one gift that equips and enables him to do his work of
                 ministry (verse 7). Unlike the pagans who are seized by some
                 power, Christians are not carried away by the Spirit blindly and
                 emotionally. Manifestations of the Spirit lead people to profess
                 that Jesus is Lord (verses 2, 3). The test, therefore, whether a
                 manifestation of the spirit is from God or from some other spirit
                 is whether these manifestations serve the lordship of Jesus
                 Christ, and whether they serve to build the church and advance
                 the gospel.

                    In what ways is the Holy Spirit manifested in the people of
                   God? 1 Cor. 12:4-7.

                      God bestows these gifts (charismata, verse 4) upon His
                   people to bear witness in the world, equipping and enabling the
                   church for administrations (service, RSV) (diakonia, verse 5),
                   following Christ's example in every line of ministry He Himself
                    performed while He lived on earth. Operations (work RSV)
                   (energemata, verse 6) refers to that which is wrought by God
                   through the gifts and the varieties of service. They are the active
                   outworkings of the gifts, such as salvation, the growth of the
                   church in numbers, and its growth in spirit and in truth (Eph.
                   4:13-16).

                     What kind of gifts has God bestowed upon His people?
                   1 Cor. 12:8-10; Eph. 4:8, 11.

                      A comparison of these texts suggests that the apostle Paul is
                   not attempting to give a full list of all the gifts or a definite
                   ranking order. What stands out clearly is: (1) that these gifts are
                   not offices but abilities for special times and places; (2) that they
                   have been given to benefit the church as a whole, and not just
                   for the growth of the individual believer receiving the gift; (3) in
                   the eyes of God all gifts and services are very significant for the
                   functioning of the body as a whole; (4) though each believer has
                   received some kind of gift and service, according to the meas-
                   ure of God, there is no one believer who unites all of these gifts
                   in himself; and (5) that all gifts, services, and workings are given
                   for the building up of the body of Christ and for the ac-
                   complishment of God's mission in the world.

THINK IT THROUGH     What is the relationship between the gifts of the Spirit and
                   the believers' natural talents?

                                                                       August 19

           Part 6   What is the purpose of, among others, pastors and
   THE MINISTRY teachers?
    OF THE LAITY
                    "It was he who gave some to be apostles, some to be
                  prophets, some to be evangelists, and some to be pastors and
                  teachers, to prepare God's people for works of service, so that
                  the body of Christ may be built up" (Eph. 4:11, 12, NIV).

                      In the King James Version of verse 12 three phrases begin
                   with "for." In Greek the first "for" has the meaning "in order to,"
                   while the other two instances use another Greek word. The
                   thought suggested by this construction is that the perfecting of
                   the saints is for the purpose of their doing a work of ministry.
                   Not that they replace the ordained minister, but that there is a
                   ministry which belongs to the laity.
                      Since the development of the laity for ministry is a function of
                   the gifts that the Spirit has given, the church may want to help
                   the believers become aware of the particular ways they can
                   serve. Then their gifts could be further stimulated and de-
                   veloped, prepared and coordinated for actual ministry. The
                   accomplishing of God's work on earth greatly depends on how
                   seriously each member of the people of God takes his calling to
                   service, and on how the church will organize itself to facilitate
                   the participation of all the believers in the ministry of Jesus
                   Christ.
                      "In their [the leaders in God's cause] planning they are to give
                   special study to the work that can be done by the laity for their
                   friends and neighbors. The work of God in this earth can never
                   be finished until the men and women comprising our church
                   membership rally to the work and unite their efforts with those
                   of ministers and church officers."—Testimonies, vol. 9, pp. 116,
                   117.
                       "In every church the members should be so trained that they
                   will devote time to the winning of souls to Christ. How can it be
                   said of the church, 'Ye are the light of the world,' unless the
                   members of the church are actually imparting light?"—

                      In laboring where there are already some in the faith, the
                   minister should at first seek not so much to convert unbelievers,
                   as to train the church-members ... to work for others."—Gospel

     edification of the church in public
     service. A sharp cleavage into "clergy"
    and "laity" is foreign to the New
     Testament. The word "clergy" (and its
     cogrtate,§), is derived from the Greek
    word kleros, which means
     "allotment," "inheritance," or
     "portion." In the Scripture kldros is
     used to indicate (1) the share of
     salvation in Jesus Christ, (2) the

    portion of peace and joy. These
    special privileges belong to all the
    members of the household of God.

       MINISTRY
                    Although the believers share alike in the calling and the
                 privileges of the ministry of Jesus Christ, the Bible insists that all
                 of these functions be carried out "in order" (1 Cor. 14:40). Each
                 function can properly be carried out only in cooperation with
                 other gifts and services. Thus there are limitations on the ser-
                 vice of each believer. These limitations are determined by the
                 particular gift received and the place of service. Under Christ's
                 guidance the church defines and regulates the varieties of ser-
                 vice. This becomes apparent in the church's appointment and
                 affirmation of specialized ministers.

                      What special ministries does Paul mention? Eph. 4:11;
                    1 Cor. 12:28.

                       These specialized ministries are unmerited gifts of grace.
                    They are functions, not offices; services, not positions. These
                    specialized ministries belong to the whole church; but they can
                    best be carried out through "chosen servants" to whom God
                    has given these special gifts. The specialized ministry, there-
                    fore, is performed by delegation to individuals. The authority for
                    this ministry rests with the church. God takes the initiative in
                    calling persons from among His chosen people and in endow-
                    ing them with special gifts. The church then tests these people
                    to know whether their call is from God. If the call has been found
                    genuine, the church then recognizes, confirms, and supports
                    their services with the gifts and services of every other member.

                      What is the hallmark of ministry according to the teaching of
                    Jesus? Matt. 20:25-28.

                      The usual word in the New Testament for "ministry" is
                   diakonia, and the minister is called a diakonos, from which our
                    word "deacon" comes. Given the large choice of words avail-
                   able in Greek to describe the function of a minister, it is remark-
                   able that the New Testament writers usually chose this term,
                   which stresses the idea of serving. The basic meaning of
                   diakonia is "to serve at the table." The New Testament em-
                   phasizes that ministry is characterized by a special subordina-
                   tion. The inspired writers of the New Testament emphasized
                   that everyone who is called to minister by the grace of God is
                   thereby called to follow Christ, who, being equal with God,
                   made Himself a slave of all men. He did not come to be served,
                   but to be a servant of all.

         Part 2    "Ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto
    CHRIST, OUR the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls" (1 Peter 2:25).
      MINISTER
                   All appointed ministries and services rest in Jesus. All gifts
                have validity, only to the extent that they are based on Christ's
                own ministry on earth and in heaven, and to the extent that they
                are carried out in the spirit of Jesus Christ. Ministry in the
                church becomes in reality the imitation and the continuation by
                believers, through the Spirit, of the ministry of Jesus Christ
                (John 15; 16:1-15).
                   Service characterized the ministry of Jesus. He made Himself
                nothing; He took the form and nature of a slave and lived a life
                that was wholly dedicated to God and to His fellowmen. The
                great motive of His servanthood was love. It manifested itself in
                subordination and obedience, in lowliness and humility, in wit-
                nessing and suffering.
                   It is precisely these characteristics of Jesus' ministry that lend
                it such great authority! Worldly powers and authorities demand
                obedience on the ground of their position, status, or dignity. In
                the church authority does not stem from an office or status, but
                from the church's recognition that the ministers are really faith-
                ful representatives of Jesus Christ who continue their ministry
                 in lowliness and humility, obedience and sacrifice, and who
                 give their lives to serve others out of love.

                       In what two ways can the church recognize whether a minis-
                    try is based on Christ's ministry? Luke 22:25-27; 2 Cor. 5:18-20.

                       Ministry, the call to service, is an unmerited gift of grace. (See
                    1 Cor. 15:8-10.) Nobody can be a servant of God by his own will,
                    intellect, or training. "We have this treasure in earthen vessels,
                    that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us" (2
                    Cor. 4:7). Such a ministry can be performed only by the person
                    in whom Christ lives and who is truly converted. Only the person
                    whose sins have been forgiven and who lives in the newness of
                    life can really serve as a representative of Jesus Christ.

             Part 3  "God has set some In the church, first apostles" (1 Cor.
          APOSTLES 12:28).

                        The word "apostle" means "someone who is sent." He is one
                     sent for a particular task and with the authority of him who has
                     sent him. An apostle, in the New Testament, is therefore a
                     representative of Jesus Christ, who sends him with His authority
                     to carry out His mission. (See John 20:21-23.) Our word "mis-
                     sionary" reflects the meaning of "apostle" in this literal sense of
                     the word. The apostles Peter and Paul stress the fact that apos-
                     tles were eyewitnesses of the resurrected Jesus, who also have
                     been called to preach the great events of His life. (See Acts
                     1:15-26; 1 Cor. 9:1, 2.) This special call distinguishes the apostle
                     from others who had also been eyewitnesses (Luke 24:13, 18,
                     33; 1 Cor. 15:5-8). Sometimes the term "apostle" is limited to the
                     Twelve, the original bearers of the gospel message, the "foun-
                     dation stones" of the church. Their names appear also on the
                     foundations of the wall of the New Jerusalem (Eph. 2:20; Rev.
                     21:14). "Apostle" is used for Paul and Barnabas (Acts 14:4, 14)
                     Apollos (1 Cor. 4:6, 9), and Silvanus and Timothy (1 Thess. 1:1;
                     2:6). And, of course, Jesus Himself is called an apostle (Heb.
                     3:1). These facts point out that "apostle" in the New Testament
                     has both a technical and a general meaning. In its technical
                     sense it refers to those who have seen the risen—or exalted—
                     Lord, who have been entrusted with the gospel to keep it, and
                     who have been directly commissioned by Jesus to preach it.
                     Apostles in the wider sense of the word, then, are all those who
                     are specially sent by the church on the basis of the word deliv-
                     ered by Christ and His apostles, the foundation stones of the
                     church. We would do well to remember, however, that the word
                     "apostle" refers to a function, a call to service.

THINK IT THROUGH       In what ways can the church of God truly be apostolic?

                        "As Christ sent forth His disciples, so today He sends forth the
                     members of His church. The same power that the apostles had
                     is for them. If they will make God their strength, He will work
                     with them, and they shall not labor in vain."—The Acts of the
                     Apostles, p. 599.

                     empowered by Him to do a special work.

         Part 4  "Ye are built upon the foundation of the apostles and
      PROPHETS prophets" (Eph. 2:20).

                       Sometimes in the New Testament the prophets are mentioned
                   together with the apostles. For examples, see Luke 11:49 and
                   Rev. 18:20. Both functions are a gift of the Spirit. The church
                   chooses neither prophets nor apostles. It can test them and
                   recognize whether or not their words are from God; it can allow
                   them to speak or refuse them; it can accept their word or reject
                   it. The criterion for testing them is whether they testify to Jesus
                   as Lord and whether they edify the church. (See 1 Cor. 12:3, 7;
                   14:1-40.)

                     What is the function of the prophets in the church? 2 Peter
                   1:19-21; 1 Cor. 14:3.

                      The gift of prophecy is the authority to speak to men for God.
                   Prophets declare what the will of God is for the present, and
                   sometimes they predict future events, such as Agabus did. (See
                   Acts 11:28; 21:10, 11.) The primary function of the prophets is
                   edifying the church. Prophets, through visions, dreams, audi-
                   tions, or a special enlightenment of the mind, give new truths or
                   new insights into truths already revealed. They are also sent to
                   call the church back from erroneous thought or behavior, to
                   awaken the church, and to arouse it to faith and action. Com-
                   monly the revelations these people receive are to meet special
                   needs and immediate situations in the church. Since such
                   needs arise ever anew, the gift of prophecy is an abiding feature
                   of the church of God and a mark of its authenticity'. (See Rev.
                   12:17; 19:10.)
                      Many Christians believe that the gift of prophecy ceased with
                   the early church. The Scriptures testify that this gift will be
                   present in the church until the last day (Eph. 4:11-13). Seventh-
                   day Adventists believe that the gift of prophecy was manifest in
                   the work of Ellen G. White.

THINK IT THROUGH     What is the relationship of the gift of prophecy to the canon
                   of the Holy Scripture?

                      "The Holy Scriptures are to be accepted as an authoritative,
                   infallible revelation of His will. They are the standard of charac-
                   ter, the revealer of doctrines, and the test of experience. . . .
                      "Yet the fact that God has revealed His will to men through His
                   word, has not rendered needless the continued presence and
                   guiding of the Holy Spirit. On the contrary, the Spirit was prom-

           Part 5  "He gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some,
      EVANGELISTS evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; for the perfect-
     AND TEACHERS Ing of the saints, for the work of the ministry" (Eph. 4:11, 12).

                        According to Hebrews 5:12, the whole church "ought to be
                     teachers." However, many believers continue to need someone
                     to teach them the ABC's of God's oracles again. For this reason
                     teachers are extremely important to the church. They are men-
                     tioned along with apostles and prophets in First Corinthians
                     12:28 and in Ephesians 4:11.

                       What Is the role of teachers in the church? Matt. 28:19, 20.

                       Teaching in the New Testament means much more than what
                    is commonly understood by it today. Teaching is not merely
                    giving instructions and explanations or passing on information.
                    It means edification, care and nurture of the spirit as much as of
                    the mind. Without such teachers the church cannot grow—that
                    is, grow in the understanding of truth, in maturity and perfec-
                    tion, in the stature of Christ. Teaching is a gift that guards the
                    truth and spreads it; it edifies the congregation and helps the
                    people of God to apply it to their everyday life situation. Teach-
                    ing, therefore, is a function of the pastor, the evangelist, the
                    elder, or the deacon. (See 1 Tim. 3:2; 5:17; 2 Tim. 2:2, 24.) It is an
                    extremely important service, which carries grave respon-
                    sibilities.
                       The name "evangelist" is related to the word euangelion,
                    which is translated as "the gospel." From the few indications
                    the Bible gives us concerning their service, evangelists were
                    preachers of the gospel, especially to those who had never
                    heard it before. To that end these men traveled from place to
                    place, proclaiming the message of Jesus Christ, raising up
                    churches and organizing them. They were not just preachers;
                    they were also pastors of the flock the Lord gave them. Neither
                    was evangelism the function of a specialist only. Philip, the
                    evangelist, was one of the seven deacons chosen to wait on the
                    tables of the widows (Acts 6:1-6), and Timothy, whom the apos-
                    tle Paul exhorted to do the work of an evangelist, was the pastor
                    of a local church. The work of an evangelist, like any other
                    service, was not an office or a position; it was rather a gift
                    entrusted to people in the church who either full-time or part-
                    time employed that gift.

                                                                        August 26

          Part 6     "Do not neglect the gift you have, which was given you by
     ORDINATION    prophetic utterance when the elders laid their hands upon
                   you" (1 Tim. 4:14, RSV).

                     Some words which the King James Version has translated
                   "ordain" actually mean "to appoint" or "to choose." In the New
                   Testament no special rite is implied in the word "ordain." How-
                   ever, there are a number of instances in the New Testament
                   where by a special service persons were dedicated to ministry.

                     By what service were people in the early church set apart
                   for gospel work? Acts 6:6; 13:1-3.

                      By the act of laying on of hands, today called ordination, the
                   church recognizes and affirms the gift which God has bestowed
                   upon certain people to equip them for their special ministry. It is
                   important to note that first comes the special gift of God, then its
                   services and workings, and finally the church's affirmation by
                   which some people are installed for a definite form of ministry.
                   By the rite of the laying on of hands the one set apart receives no
                   new authority, no special power, no new grace or qualification.
                   As the case of the seven deacons clearly indicates, the men
                   were already equipped for their task before the laying on of
                   hands, being "full of the Spirit and of wisdom" (Acts 6:3, NEB).
                      Wrong ideas about ordination developed in the church after
                   apostolic times. We can avoid these by understanding the na-
                   ture of the ceremony of ordination in the New Testament. The
                   ceremony of the laying on of hands "added no new grace or
                   virtual qualification. It was an acknowledged form of designa-
                   tion to an appointed office and a recognition of one's authority
                   in that office. By it the seal of the church was set upon the work
                   of God. . . .
                      "At a later date the rite of ordination by the laying on of hands
                   was greatly abused ;'unwarrantable importance was attached to
                   the act, as if a power came at once upon those who received
                   such ordination, which immediately qualified them for any and
                   all ministerial work."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 162.

                                                                       August 28

     THE CHURCH     church, to send chosen men of their own company" (Acts 15:6,
                    22).

                       The New Testament does not offer us a fixed plan of organiza-
                    tion. The church was then only in the beginning stages of
                    development. But from that beginning the Holy Spirit provided
                    for its further development. The church is a spiritual body that
                    must constantly be open to the leading of the Holy Spirit. That
                    demands a flexible organization which will allow new ministries
                    to be born either as a result of divine revelation or because of
                    new circumstances.

                      What are some scriptural evidences of a definite order and
                    organization in the New Testament church? Acts 6:1-8; 15:22,
                    23; 2 Thess. 3:6, 7; Titus 1:5.

                       Organization and order have characterized the church from
                    its very beginning. Some of the organizational steps they took
                    were these: The believers held meetings; a definite discipline
                    and decorum was maintained; letters of recommendation were
                    sent from one church to another; collections were taken and
                    sent from one church to another; registers were kept of the
                    widows under the care of the church; elders and deacons were
                    appointed; and new members were added and instructed.
                       "We want to hold the lines evenly, that there shall be no
                    breaking down of the system of regulation and order. In this way
                    license shall not be given to disorderly elements to control the
                    work at this time. We are living in a time when order, system, and
                    unity of action are most essential."—Testimonies to Ministers,
                    p. 228.
                       "Some have advanced the thought that as we near the close
                    of time, every child of God will act independently of any reli-
                    gious organization. But I have been instructed by the Lord that
                    in this work there is no such thing as every man's being
                    independent."—Testimonies to Ministers, p. 489.

                    when thorough organization is essential and will be the greatest
                    power to keep our spurious uprisings and to refute claims not

Church Order and Organization              LESSON 10                     ❑ Monday
                                                                          August 29

         Part 2   "When they had ordained them elders in every church, and
      THE ELDER had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on
                whom they believed" (Acts 14:23).

                     Apostles, prophets, teachers, and evangelists were general
                   ministers whose gifts and services benefited the entire church.
                   The words "elder," "bishop," "pastor," and "deacon" refer to
                   one who served primarily in a local congregation or district.
                   Elder, bishop, and pastor are synonomous.

                     What were some duties of the elder in the New Testament
                   church? Acts 20:28-31; 1 Peter 5:1-3; Titus 1:9.

                      Wherever a new church was planted and organized, the apos-
                   tles appointed elders to ad minister it, to careforthe believers, to
                   instruct them, and to nurture them. This work of tending "the
                   flock" was to be done after the pattern of Christ, "neither as
                   being lords over God's heritage, but being ensamples to the
                   flock" (1 Peter 5:3). It means serving, not dominating; humbling
                   oneself, not exalting. The elder is called to be a good shepherd:
                   He does not act as an hireling, who is motivated only by money
                   and flees when danger comes (John 10:12, 13), but who is
                   willing to sacrifice his all for the sake of the flock. He is called to
                   feed and nurture the flock by declaring to them "all the counsel
                   of God" (Acts 20: 27), as "a good teacher" (1 Tim. 3:2, NEB).
                   From Paul's example we see that the elder's work is to ad-
                   monish and to encourage (1 Thess. 5:12-14), to help and to
                   comfort, even with tears (Acts 20:31, 35), to counsel and to
                   discipline with patience and tenderness, to exhort in sound
                   doctrine, and to refute those who contradict (Titus 1:9). The
                    service of an elder in the church is certainly not easy. It is
                    described as laboring at great cost and much sacrifice.

                     What qualifications for becoming an elder did Paul record?
                   1 Tim. 3:1-7.

                     The fact that God inspired the apostle Paul to write twice (see
                   Titus 1:5-9 also) a rather extensive list of the qualifications for
                   elders evidences God's concern over the leadership of the
                   church and the necessity for great care in choosing such lead-
                   ers. These qualifications concern the personal character of the
                   elder, his family, his relations to others, both inside and outside
                   the church, his abilities, talents, and gifts, his standing before
                   God, and his faith.

                   ship of elders?

          Part 3   "A bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God" (Titus
      THE BISHOP 1:7).

                     What was the role of the bishop in the New Testament?
                   1 Tim. 3:2, 5; Titus 1:7-9.

                      In the New Testament the words "bishop," "elder," and "pas-
                   tor" were used of the same men. The English word "bishop" is a
                   transliteration of the Greek word episkopos (overseer), who in
                   the New Testament looked after the needs of a local congrega-
                   tion. Bishop or overseer was neither a title nor an office. It was
                   the function of an elder, and clearly a service based on a special
                   gift of grace.
                      In Acts 20:17 the apostle Paul summoned the elders of the
                   church at Ephesus to meet him at Miletus. In speaking to them
                   he addressed them as pastors and overseers (bishops) of the
                   flock (verse 28). Similarly in Titus 1:5, the apostle gives instruc-
                   tion for the ordination of elders in every city. When he sub-
                   sequently lists their qualifications, he calls them "bishops"
                   (verse 7). In doing the work of an overseer (bishop) and pastor,
                   the elder is continuing the ministry of Jesus Christ, "the
                   Shepherd and Bishop of your souls" (1 Peter 2:25). This pas-
                   toral and administrative leaderhip of a local church is not that of
                   "lording it over" the believers who are allotted to the elders'
                   care (1 Peter 5:3), but after the pattern of Christ, who taught His
                   disciples that their form of leadership would not be like that of
                   the world (Luke 22:26, 27). "Whoever wants to be great must be
                   your servant, and whoever wants to be first must be the willing
                   slave of all" (Mark 10: 44, NEB). It is on the basis of this kind of
                   service, and of their special qualifications (see 1 Tim. 3:1-7;
                   Titus 1:5-9), that the congregation is called to recognize their
                   church elders as pastors and bishops and to "hold them in the
                   highest possible esteem and affection" (1 Thess. 5:13, NEB).
                   (See also Heb. 13:17.)

THINK IT THROUGH     Is it a wrong ambition to strive to become a bishop? What is
                   the Christian motive for such an aspiration?

                      "To aspire to leadership is an honourable ambition" (1 Tim.
                   3:1, NEB).
                      "Whatever gift each of you may have received, use it in service
                   to one another, like good stewards dispensing the grace of God
                   in its varied forms. Are you a speaker? Speak as if you uttered
                   oracles of God. Do you give service? Give it as in the strength
                   which God supplies. In all things so act that the glory may be
                   God's through Jesus Christ; to him belong glory and power for
                   ever and ever. Amen" (1 Peter 4: 10, 11, NEB).

                                                                   August 31

         Part 4  "Those who serve well as deacons gain a good standing for
    THE DEACON themselves and also great confidence in the faith which is in
                Christ Jesus" (1 Tim. 3:13, RSV).

                    In the New Testament the leadership of the local churches
                  was in the hands of elders (bishops) and deacons. (See also
                  Phil. 1:1; 1 Tim. 3:1-13.) The word "deacon" comes from the
                  g reek diakonos, which in Greek literature denoted a servant or a
                  slave whose duties consist of waiting on his master's table and
                  sometimes doing the shopping for him. Throughout the New
                  Testament the word diakonos, and its cognates is used in a
                  large variety of meanings. All of these stress some kind of
                  servanthood. Christ is called a diakonos; and His ministry both
                  in form and in attitude, is spoken of as diakonia. (See Phil. 2:7.)
                  These words are also used of the ministry of Paul and of other
                  apostles and elders. The information in the New Testament
                  makes it highly plausible to conclude that the deacons were
                  originally the assistants of the apostles (see Acts 6:1-8) and that
                  they later served as "associate pastors," assisting the elders or
                  bishops in the performance of their many duties, according to
                  their particular gifts.

                    What were the qualifications for a deacon? 1 Tim. 3: 8-13.

                    The functions of the deacon were connected with both the
                  administration of the church and the spiritual life of the believ-
                  ers. To carry out these responsibilities, the gifts and the qualifi-
                  cations necessary to become a deacon were about the same as
                  those of an elder or bishop. Deacons served as administrators,
                  according to their gift. (Rom. 12:6, 7), especially in relation to
                  material and financial matters. Thus they were to be honest, not
                  "greedy for gain." Since they were called to visit the believers at
                  home, they should be "serious, not double-tongued" (1 Tim.
                  3:8, RSV).
                    "The appointment of the seven [deacons] to take the over-
                  sight of special lines of work, proved a great blessing to the
                  church. These officers gave careful consideration to individual
                  needs as well as to the general financial interests of the church,
                  and by their prudent management and their godly example they
                  were an important aid to their fellow officers in binding together
                  the various interests of the church into a united whole."—The

          Part 5    "If thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him
        CHURCH his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee,
      DISCIPLINE thou hast gained thy brother. But if he will not hear thee, then
                  take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or
                  three witnesses every word may be established. And if he
                  shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he
                  neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen
                  man and a publican" (Matt. 18:15-17).

                      Jesus taught three steps to follow in dealing with an offender:
                      1.Settle the matter first between brothers. Do not expose him,
                   thereby increasing the difficulty of disciplining him. But go to
                   the erring one, with a heart filled with Christ's love and sym-
                   pathy, and seek to adjust the matter. Read James 5:20.
                      2. If this fails, witnesses are to be included in a second at-
                   tempt, so that if it comes before the church, it will be estab-
                   lished.
                      3. In case further action becomes necessary, it is to be taken
                   by the whole church.

                     What is the purpose and means of church discipline? Matt.
                   18:15-17; Gal. 6:1; Titus 3:9, 10; 1 Thess. 5:14.

                     The aim of church discipline is to make men and women
                   disciples of Jesus Christ. Where members refuse to become
                   united with Christ and follow Him, discipline must be carried out
                   for the sake of those who still are disciples of Christ, but who
                   may suffer great harm if falsehood and evil are not put away. As
                   such, the Bible mentions contention between members, disor-
                   derly conduct, divisiveness, false teachings, and gross sins.
                   Among these the apostle Paul lists immorality, covetousness,
                   idolatry, abusive speech, drunkenness, swindling.
                     Among the forms of discipline the Scripture mentions: warn-
                   ing, admonition, and rebuke (1 Thess. 5:12,14); withholding the
                   full rights and privileges of church members (2 Thess. 3:6-16);
                   still counting the offender as a brother but forbidding him to
                   hold certain offices or to represent the church publicly; and, as
                   a last resort, disfellowshiping. (See 1 Tim. 1:20; Matt. 18:17.)

                     What will be the effect of successful discipline? 2 Tim. 2:25,
                   26.

                                                                    September 2

         Part 6      Three main types of church government exist in modern
       CHURCH      Christianity:
   GOVERNMENT        1. Presbyterian. The name comes from the Greek word for
                   elder. Thus a church with a presbyterian government is one
                   governed by elders. The elders are of two kinds—ruling elders
                   who are laymen, and teaching elders who are ministers. Four
                   groups of elders make up the system—the session, the presby-
                   tery, the synod, and the general assembly.
                      2. Episcopal. There are three orders of ministry: bishops,
                   priests (elders, ministers), and deacons. The right to consecrate
                   other bishops and to ordain priests and deacons belong to the
                   bishop only. This provides for a succession of bishops and their
                   authority over the priests (ministers, elders), and deacons, and
                   thereby their rulership over the whole church. The papal system
                   adds a pope who is over all the bishops.
                      3.Congregational. Here the authority of the church resides in
                   each local church as an independent unit with no person or
                   organization above it except Christ the Head. Ministers and
                   other elected church officers represent functions of the priest-
                   hood of all believers, based on these people's special calling,
                   gifts, and training.
                      Each of these three systems has some roots in the New Tes-
                   tament. The episcopal form goes back to the special power and
                   authority given to the apostles (Matt. 10:40; 18:18); the pres-
                   byterian, to the equality of the elders, or bishops (Acts 20:28;
                   1 Tim. 3:1-7; 5:17; etc.) and the concept of the gifts mentioned in
                   Ephesians 4:7-16; while the congregational form grows out of
                   the biblical notion of the priesthood of all believers (1 Peter 2:9)
                   and the concept of the church as a "charismatic movement."
                      In light of the essence and nature of the church, each of these
                    principles stands in need of being balanced, complemented,
                   and corrected by the others. A system of government stands
                   constantly in need of becoming corrected by the other princi-
                    ples given in the New Testament. This means that every church
                    order must be both constant and flexible in its structure, defi-
                    nite and at the same time always open to correction and refor-
                    mation.

THINK IT THROUGH     How do you think the Seventh-day Adventist system of
                   church government compares with these New Testament
                   principles?

           Part 1     "God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world;
      THE WORLD     but that the world through him might be saved" (John 3:17).

                        In the New Testament the four Greek words which are trans-
                     lated as "world" have at least six different meanings and many
                     more different shades of meaning. Which meaning is intended
                     can be determined only by the context in which the words occur
                     and by comparison with other passages of Scripture. For an
                     understanding of the church's relation to the world it is impera-
                     tive, therefore, that we first understand the biblical meanings of
                     the term "world." The most important ones are: (1) God's crea-
                     tion, the earth, its people and their activities, such as in Acts
                     17:24; Matt. 24:21; Heb. 11:3; (2) the people on earth, of all times
                     and places, who are the object of God's love, as in John 1:29;
                     3:16, 17; 2 Cor. 5:19; (3) hypocritical people who have rejected
                     Jesus but appear religious: John 15:18-21; (4) human thoughts
                    and activities that. are not in harmony with the purposes and
                     laws of God's kingdom: Rom. 12:2; 1 Cor. 1:20; (5) the geo-
                    graphical earth; Mark 16:15; Matt. 26:13; (6) ideas, concepts,
                     and activities related to our human condition. In this last sense,
                     for instance, Jesus was in the world (John 1:10; 17:13; 1 Tim.
                     1:15), sharing our flesh and blood, and participating in the
                     world's economic and social activities, culture, and way of life.
                        /t is important to notice that the meaning of the term "world"
                    in the New Testament is determined by its relationship to Jesus
                    Christ. The discussion on the relationship of the church to the
                     world, therefore, should not be guided by what social scientists
                    or our cultural or religious traditions understand by the term
                     "world," but by its New Testament meaning.

THINK IT THROUGH      Compare the meaning of the word "world" in the New Tes-
                    tament with the way we generally use it in the church or in our
                    society.

                      For the sake of the work of God it is imperative that we see
                    what relationship ideally exists between the church and the
                    world. The standard by which we may make that distinction is
                    the person and the work of Jesus Christ.

          Part 2   "As thou hest sent me into the world, even so have I also
       INTO ALL sent them into the world" (John 17:18).
     THE WORLD
                   For what purpose did Christ come into the world? John 3:16,
                 17; 18:37; 1 John 3:8.

                     Christ came to establish the kingdom of God. He came to
                   vindicate the name of God, to reveal His true character and what
                   the foundations of His kingdom are: love, in which are freedom
                   and obedience, mercy and justice. Christ came to unmask the
                   devil, to destroy his works, and to defeat him. In Christ's suffer-
                   ing and death the true nature of sin became manifest, but also
                   God's love for the world and the way to eternal life, joy, and
                   peace. When this message of the kingdom will have been
                   preached in all the world, the end will come (Matt. 24:14).

                    For What purpose did Christ send His church into the world?
                   Matt. 28:18-20; Rev. 14:6, 7.

                     How comprehensive is the object of the mission Christ has
                   given His church? Mark 16:15.

                      In the Scriptures, the world is not in the first place areas and
                   places. It stands for the people of the world and their activities,
                   ideas, and thoughts. The task of the church, therefore, is not
                   accomplished by its mere presence in all the countries or areas
                   or places of the world, but by its contact with all the people, by
                   penetrating their activities, and by influencing their thoughts
                   and ideas. Though the Seventh-day Adventist Church has been
                   planted in nearly 95 percent of the countries of the world, there
                   are some two billion people who have never even heard the
                   gospel of Jesus Christ. Another billion people, perhaps, have
                   never heard the three angels' messages with clarity. Not until
                    "all the world"—that is, the poor and the rich, the educated and
                   the uneducated, the Hindu and the Buddhist, the Muslim and
                   the ones who are "born" Christians, the secularist and the
                    communist, the Westerner and the Easterner, people of all
                    races, languages, cultures, nations—will have heard the mes-
                   sage of the kingdom with clarity, will the work of Christ in the
                    world be accomplished.

                                                                        September 6

            Part 3   "If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it
           IN THE hated you. If ye were of the world, the world would love his
      WORLD, BUT— own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen
                   you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you" (John
                   15:18, 19).

                       For what does the Christian suffer in the world? 1 Peter
                     2:19-25.

                        The world hated Christ not just because He was different, but
                     because His difference exposed them as liars and hypocrites.
                     This included pious and religious people who stood con-
                     demned in the light of Jesus' whole life and work and words. It is
                     because Jesus spoke "openly to the world" (John 18:20) that
                     the world hated Him, persecuted Him, and finally murdered
                     Him. The people could not stand having a holy person in their
                     midst. It made them uncomfortable and uneasy. This is true also
                     concerning the followers of Jesus Christ. The more they imitate
                     their Lord's example, the more they will draw the ire and perse-
                     cution of the world, especially of the religious leaders. If a
                     church is really active and the members live a life of purity and
                     honesty, the world around them will feel condemned for living
                     in sin. The Christians will be hated and despised just as Jesus
                     was.
                        Sometimes government authorities will try to force Christians
                     to give up their faith and persecute the church because it is felt
                     to be a threat to the unity of the country or to the principles upon
                     which the nation is founded. Sometimes suffering and persecu-
                     tion come from unbelieving, secular people, in the form of
                     ridicule and boycott, because their social life is affected or their
                     commercial interests are threatened. Worst of all, though, is the
                     suffering caused by "worldlings" who claim to be believers
                     themselves, even teachers or leaders.

THINK IT THROUGH       What may be wrong when the world likes and praises a
                     church?

                        "The apostle Paul declares that 'all that will live godly in
                     Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.' 2 Timothy 3:12. Why is it,
                     then, that persecution seems in a great degree to slumber? The
                     only reason is that the church has conformed to the world's
                     standard and therefore awakens no opposition. . . . It is only
                     because of the spirit of compromise with sin, because the great
                     truths of the word of God are so indifferently regarded, because
                     there is so little vital godliness in the church, that Christianity is
                     apparently so popular with the world."—The Great Con-

                                                                  September 7

         Part 4   "Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are
        CHURCH Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's" (Matt. 22:
      AND STATE 21).

                      As followers of Jesus Christ, the church seeks no earthly
                   power. That would be a denial of its very nature. The church's
                   involvement in government affairs would detract from its own
                   particular work and calling; it would also deny Christ's very own
                   life and ministry. Governmental oppression and intolerance of
                   religion are the inevitable result. This does not mean that
                   church and state are not related. For the Head of the church is
                   also the Lord of lords and King of kings. (See Rom. 13:1-4.)
                   Because of the role governments have in the economy of God,
                   Christians are urged to "pay tax and toll, reverence and re-
                   spect" (Rom. 13:7, NEB), obedience and honor to the au-
                   thorities in power. (See also 1 Peter 2:16, 17.)

                     What are some possible points of conflict between church
                   and state? Acts 5:27-33.

                     Ideally, there should be no conflict. But governments are not
                   always willing instruments of God. As a result, laws may be
                   passed, decrees given, institutions established, which conflict
                   with the very nature and goals of the church. When that hap-
                   pens, the church has no other choice but to "obey God rather
                   than men."
                     Another area of possible conflict arises from the church's use
                   of instruments for the accomplishment of its mission. Many of
                   these instruments fall under the proper jurisdiction of the state,
                   or are claimed to be the sole prerogative of the government.
                   Notable examples are schools and educational programs, med-
                   ical facilities and health programs, radio and television, land
                   and other properties.

THINK IT THROUGH     Since points of conflict seem to be unavoidable, what would
                   be the best relationship between church and state?

                      1. Separate the activities and duties of the state from those of
                   the church, and recognize and respect each other's sole author-
                   ity in its own sphere and domain.
                      2. Where cooperation seems necessary because of mutual
                   concerns such as in education, medical institutions, properties,
                   etc., respect for each other and recognition of each other's
                   rights and duties should be a guide to settle possible conflicts.
                   Without compromising its obedience to God , the church should
                   always recognize that it is called to be a servant of all men, and
                   that the example of its Lord and Master demands that it subor-
                   dinate itself, choosing suffering rather than force.

            Part 5   "I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means
          CHURCH save some. And this I do for the gospel's sake" (1 Cor. 9:22,
       AND SOCIETY 23).

                       The church, like its Head and Founder, has clearly two dimen-
                     sions: a human and a divine. Though distinguishable, these two
                     are inseparable. On the one hand, the church is absolute and
                     unchangeable, the same forever; on the other hand, it is open to
                     influence from its surroundings.
                        As a divine institution, the church stands over and above all
                     culture and society. It must warn people of the evil trends in a
                     given society and their effects on people's relationship to Christ
                     and to one another—for instance: smoking, gambling, the use
                     of alcohol, drug abuse, the degrading influence of certain films
                     and television programs, etc.
                       As a human institution the church must adapt itself, where not
                     contrary to principle, to the cultural practices and the structures
                     of the society from which its members come. (See 1 Cor. 9:19.)

                       What principles should guide the church in Its relation to
                     culture and society? 1 Cor. 9:19-23. (See also Phil. 2:5-8.)

                        As Christ, the Son of God, became as one of us, taking upon
                     Himself the human form after thousands of years of sin, so also
                     is the church called to identify itself with people of every race,
                     society, language, nation, culture, political or economic sys-
                     tem, philosophical or religious orientation. Though clearly dis-
                     tinct from all cultures and societies in love and holiness the
                     church must at the same time identify itself in appropriate ways
                     with all people.

THINK IT THROUGH       How will this understanding of the role of the church In
                     society affect its life and work in its universal expansion?

                        "The varying circumstances taking place in our world call for
                     labor which will meet these peculiar developments."— Manu-
                     script 8a, 1888.
                        "He reached the hearts of the people by going among them as
                     one who desired their good. . . . He met them at their daily
                     vocations, and manifested an interest in their secular
                     affairs."—The Desire of Ages, p. 151.

          Part 6   "These were redeemed from among men, being the
  THE CHURCH AS firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb. And in their mouth was
 THE FIRSTFRUITS found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of
                 God" (Rev. 14:4, 5).

                      The church is God's chosen agency to fulfill HiS mission of
                   redemption and judgment in the world. It does so through the
                   proclamation of the gospel, verbally and in service, care, char-
                   ity, fellowship, and community. However, the church can ac-
                   complish its function of proclamation only to the extent that it
                   truly is a model of what God wants all people to be.

                     What biblical image expresses this dual role of the church
                   as model and servant of all humanity? James 1:18; Rev. 14:4.

                     In the Old Testament the firstfruits are considered a special
                   gift to God and as a pledge from God of an abundant crop. This
                   precious gift was returned to God as a token of gratitude, in
                   recognition of man's total dependence and indebtedness to
                   God. This concept played a central role in Israel's national
                   festivals and religious rituals. God's people are His firstfruits
                   (Rev. 14:4, 5). They are one with humanity, but separated for
                   God. They are the promise of a large crop, as well as God's own
                   chosen and precious few.

                      In what way only can the church fulfill its role as the
                   firstfruits of all humanity? Col. 3:1-4.

                      The full harvest has been delayed not because of the enmity 6f
                   the world against God and His chosen people; it is not a result of
                   a lack of care on the part of the husbandman; it is the disobedi-
                   ence of God's own people who have failed to live up fully to their
                   calling to be God's firstfruits.

THINK IT THROUGH    When will the church on earth reach the stage where God
                   wants it to be? How?

                   giving to the world the message of mercy, Christ would, ere this,
                   have come to the earth, and the saints would have received their

                   Christ's sake, His people should not add sin to sin by charging

                                                     There are two very important
                                                  reasons why the church today ought to

                                                  words of Jesus Christ Himself. This is
                                                  exactly what the church needs today: a

            Part 1   "Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because
             LOVE thou hast left thy first love. Remember therefore from whence
                   thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works" (Rev. 2:4, 5).

                     Ephesus was the capital city of the Roman province of Asia
                   and a very prosperous commercial center. It boasted a magnifi-
                   cent Ionic temple in honor of Diana, or Artemis, acknowledged
                   as one of the seven wonders of the world. The apostle Paul, on
                   his return from his second missionary journey, visited Ephesus
                   about AD 52. On his third missionary journey he spent nearly
                   three years there. (See Acts 19.) Upon his departure he ap-
                   pointed Timothy to supervise the rapidly growing work. Later he
                   wrote his letter to the Ephesian church, and later still his two
                   letters to its pastor, Timothy.

                     What commendation did the church in Ephesus receive
                   from Christ? Rev. 2:1-3, 6.

                     The church at Ephesus exhibited three virtues which Jesus
                   could commend: (1) It was a very active church, busy in the
                   service of God and men. (2) Patience—the believers endured
                   the hatred of the world, perhaps even physical violence and
                   abuse. (3) They staunchly defended the truth. They rejected the
                   teachings of so-called apostles as well as the practices of the
                   Nicolaitans. A splendid church, indeed! In this period from AD
                   31 till about AD 100 the church stood for missionary activity,
                   patience in suffering, and doctrinal purity.

                     What complaint did Jesus have? Verse 4.

                     Love is the first mark of a living church. Paul ended his letter
                   to the Ephesians with a prayer for all "who love our Lord Jesus
                   Christ with undying love" (Eph. 6:24, TEV). But in time their love
                   did die. They came to have activity, patience, and orthodoxy
                   without love.
                      "Is not this experience of the Ephesian church repeated in the
                   experience of the church of this generation?"—Testimonies,
                   vol. 6, p. 422.

THINK IT THROUGH     How can the church today recapture their first love? (See
                   1 John 4:19; 2 Cor. 5:14.)

                      "The believers [in Ephesus] did not sense their spiritual fall.
                   They knew not that a change had taken place in their hearts, and
                   that they would have to repent because of the nonconti nuance
                   of their first works. But God in His mercy called for repentance,
                   for a return to their first love and to the works that are always the
                   result of true, Christlike love." —Ellen G. White Comments, SDA

Characteristics of Christ's Church LESSON 12                        ❑ Monday
                                                                  September 12

         Part 2      "I know how hard pressed you are, and poor—and yet you
     SUFFERING     are rich" (Rev. 2:9, NEB).

                     The city of Smyrna boastfully regarded itself as "the pride of
                   Asia." Constantly in competition with Ephesus, this port city
                   had an excellent natural harbor and a flourishing export trade.
                   Paul first visited here around AD 53 or 54.

                    What was the ascended Lord's message to His servants in
                   Smyrna? Rev. 2:8-11.

                     The mark of a true and living church is love. This love will
                   bring unavoidable suffering. No Christian should seek it, but a
                   church that has not lost its love for its Lord and Saviour will be
                   "counted worthy to suffer shame for his name" (Acts 5:41).
                     From about AD 100 till AD 313 Christianity was illegal, and the
                   believers experienced repeated periods of persecution.

                     What forms did the tribulation take? Rev. 2:9, 10.

                      Four trials are mentioned: (1) In the midst of wealthy and
                   prosperous Smyrna, the believers were poor. Poverty is often
                   part of the cost of discipleship. (2) Slander: People were spread-
                   ing untrue, unkind remarks behind the Christians' backs. In this
                   they were serving Satan, the chief slanderer and the father of
                   lies (Rev. 12:10; John 8:44). (3) Prison; and (4) Death: Some-
                   times through permissive persecution, sometimes in agressive
                   forms, the Roman government subjected the Christians to ar-
                   rests, imprisonment, and even death if they refused to recant.
                   Their story of suffering and firmness is illustrated by the well-
                   known account of Polycarp, the faithful bishop of Smyrna, who
                   was executed probably about AD 160. "Eighty and six years
                   have I served Him," the old man remarked at his trial, "and He
                   has done me no wrong; how then can I blaspheme my King who
                   saved me?" May his example guide the lives of all who believe in
                   Christ.

THINK IT THROUGH     What comfort does Christ give to those who follow Him in
                   suffering? (See Rev. 2:10,11.) (See also Ps. 56:3; Matt. 10:28.)

                     "We must share the conflicts if we wear the crown of victory.
                   Like Jesus, we must be made perfect through suffering. Had
                   Christ's life been one of ease, then might we safely yield to sloth.
                   Since His life was marked with continual self-denial, suffering,
                   and self-sacrifice, we shall make no complaint if we are partak-
                   ers with Him. We can walk safely in the darkest path if we have
                   the Light of the world for our guide."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 71.

          Parl 3     "You are holding fast to my cause. You did not deny your
        KEEPING    faith in me" (Rev. 2:13, NEB).

                     Jesus said to Pergamum: "I know where you live" (verse 13,
                   NEB). Not only does Christ know what His people are doing
                   (Ephesus) and what they have to endure (Smyrna) but He knows
                   where they are. After AD 323, when Constantine the Great con-
                   verted to Christianity, it became popular to be a Christian. But
                   the Christian church that emerged was a blend of paganism and
                   Christianity that in effect was "the home of Satan" (verse 13,
                   NEB).

                     What is Christ's concern for the church at Pergamum? Rev.
                   2:12-15.

                      Pergamum was the religious capital of the Roman province of
                   Asia. There emperor worship began. There stood the altar of
                   Zeus and the temple of Athena. Christ's concern for His church
                   in Pergamum is that it preserve and propagate the truth. In the
                   Bible love and truth belong together. Love becomes sentimen-
                   tal if it is not rooted in and strengthened by the truth; and truth
                   becomes hard if it is not shared in love. We need to hold the
                   truth in love, to love others in the truth, and to grow in love and
                   in discernment of truth. (See Eph. 4:15; 3 John 1; Phil. 1:9.)

                     Why is truth such an important mark of the church? John
                   14:6; 8:12, 31, 32; 18:37.
                     What essential truths is Christ concerned about? Rev. 2:14.

                     1.Doctrine. They tolerated members who held the doctrine of
                   Balaam. They should have upheld faith in Jesus.
                     2. Practice. The doctrine determines the practice. The teach-
                   ing of Balaam led to idolatry and fornication. The exaltation of
                   Jesus will lead to a holy life.

THINK IT THROUGH     How is the church today threatened in its characteristic of
                   holding fast to the truth?

                     "One of the landmarks under this message [teaching the truth
                   on the sanctuary and the three angels' messages] was the tem-
                   ple of God, seen by His truth-loving people in heaven, and the
                   ark containing the law of God. The light of the Sabbath of the
                   fourth commandment flashed its strong rays in the pathway of
                   the transgressors of God's law. The nonimmortality of the
                   wicked is an old landmark. I can call to mind nothing more that
                   can come under the head of the old landmarks. All this cry about
                   changing the old landmarks is all imaginary."—Counsels to

Characteristics of Christ's Church LESSON 12                      ❑ Wednesday
                                                                  September 14

         Part 4   "I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest
       HOLINESS that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to
                teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to
                eat things sacrificed unto idols" (Rev. 2:20).

                      The longest letter of Christ is addressed to the church in a city
                   that was the least important of the seven; it describes the situa-
                   tion of the church in a period of history that, certainly as far as
                   the church is concerned, was the least glorious of all eras. It was
                   the time of the blending of church and society into an unholy
                   mixture.

                      What commendations did Christ give His church in Thya-
                   tire? Rev. 2:18, 19.

                     The church in Thyatira had love and faith; it showed good
                   service and great endurance. Beyond these, the church is
                   characterized by spiritual growth. Ephesus was backsliding; it
                   had abandoned its first love. Thyatira showed a continual
                   growth in love and in ministry. Growing into the full stature of
                   Christ is indeed an experience that should characterize the
                   whole church of God. (See 2 Thess. 1:3.) It is as Ellen White
                   remarks: "God designs that Christians shall grow continually,
                   grow up unto the full stature of men and women in Christ. All
                   who do not grow stronger, and become more firmly rooted and
                   grounded in the truth, are continually retrograding."— Tes-
                   timonies, vol. 4, p. 556.

                     What reproof did Christ give His church at Thyatira? Rev.
                   2:20-23.

                      Ephesus lacked love, but it could not bear evil, self-styled
                   apostles. Thyatira had growing love, but it tolerated an evil,
                   self-styled prophetess. What was lacking, then, was holiness of
                   life, righteousness of character, which is another indispensable
                   mark of the true church and the real Christian. (See Titus 2:12;
                   1 Thess. 4:3, 7.) Where Satan cannot destroy the church by
                   persecution from without, he resorts to polluting the church
                   from within. The unholiness that subtly threatened Thyatira was
                   much more an unholiness of thought than of behavior, of sins
                   festering in their hearts than of words or deeds. To be holy, the
                   church must learn again to live in the presence of Christ, who
                   has eyes like a flame of fire and who searches mind and heart
                   (Rev. 2:18, 23).

         REALITY
                       When the church at Sardis received its letter from Christ, the
                    city's ancient glory was gone. There coins had been invented
                    and used as money for the first time in history. There the fabu-
                    lous king Croesus had reigned amid his treasures until the city
                    fell to Cyrus. Over the centuries Sardis declined until in AD 17 it
                    was destroyed by an earthquake. Though it was rebuilt under
                    the emperor Tiberius, the city of Sardis was only a name, not
                    reality. The same was true of the church, both as a local com-
                    munity and as a period in the history of the church, which is the
                    Reformation era.

                      What warning does Christ give His church at Sardis? Rev.
                    3:1-3.

                       The church in Sardis lived on its reputation, but this no longer
                    accorded with reality. The activities carried out were routine
                    duties, but in the sight of God they did not fulfill His purpose or
                    pattern. The name of Sardis was a lie. Christ gave them a strong
                    rebuke. The church consisted of Christians who were such in
                    name only. It is a danger that the church of all ages, and
                    everywhere, faces after a while.
                       "When the Saviour pointed out to His followers the signs of
                    His return, He foretold the state of backsliding that would exist
                    just prior to His second advent. . . .
                       "The condition of the church at this time is pointed out in the
                    Saviour's words in the Revelation: 'Thou hast a name that thou
                    livest, and art dead.' "—The Great Controversy, pp. 309, 310.

                      What remedy does Christ propose? Rev. 3:2-4.

                      1. In every period of the history of God's church, and in all
                    locations, a godly remnant always remains. God calls His rem-
                    nant to wake up, to strengthen what remains. He calls for
                    revival and reformation.
                      2. A second remedy lies in remembering what we have re-
                    ceived and heard, to keep that, and to repent (verse 3).

THINK IT THROUGH      What is it that the church has received and heard, and that it
                    should keep?

                      "Those who have been born again remember with what joy
                    and gladness they received the light of heaven, and how eager
                    they were to tell everybody of their happiness."—Ellen G. White

Characteristics of Christ's Church LESSON 12                          ❑ Friday
                                                                  September 16

        Part 6   "I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut
   OPPORTUNITY it: for thou hast a little strength, and has kept my word, and
               hast not denied my name" (Rev. 3:8).

                     While Christ's letter to Sardis contained severe censure, the
                   letter to Philadelphia is one of unqualified commendation. A
                   new opportunity was given for the church to awake, and the
                   remnant referred to in the Sardis period made every use of this
                   God-given "open door." At the end of the eighteenth century
                   and the beginning of the nineteenth, a real awakening took
                   place in the churches all over the world. There was genuine
                   repentance and personal victory over sin. God granted the
                   church an opportunity to discover anew the whole gospel, and
                   an open door was given for this gospel of the kingdom to be
                   spread rapidly in all the world.

                     What are the meanings of the "open door which no one can
                   shut"? Rev. 3:7, 8; Matt. 25:10; 1 Cor. 16:9.

                     The metaphor of the door is used in Scripture in two main
                   senses. The first is a reference to God's door of mercy; it is the
                   opportunity of salvation and of the open communication be-
                   tween Christ and man. "Let us thank God with heart and soul
                   and voice; and let us learn to approach unto Him as through an
                   open door, believing that we may come freely with our petitions,
                   and that He will hear and answer."—Ellen G. White Comments,
                   SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 961.
                     The second open door is the opportunity for mission, for
                   service. God called a special people into existence, not for
                   themselves only, but that the whole world may be saved and
                   come to a knowledge of truth. The church would do well to
                   remember that God has chosen His people to spread abroad
                   God's offer of salvation to all men, and that God gives His
                   church every opportunity to accomplish its God-given mission.
                   And even when tribulations will arise in the future, Christ urges
                   His church to avail itself of the God-given opportunity for mis-
                   sion, for "I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation" (Rev.
                   3:10). God does not spare His church from suffering, but He
                   always upholds His people.
                     If the door is the symbol of salvation, and of the church's
                   opportunity for service, the key is the symbol of Christ's power
                   and authority. Both of these "keys" Christ has given to His
                   church. (See Matt. 16:19; Acts 2:14-41; 8:14-17; 10:44-48.)

   complacent. They revel in the
   self-conceit that they bear all these

   makes them think that they are God's

   has had. But in their complacency and
   self-glorification they forget that God
   has chosen them, not for their own

HALFHEARTEDNESS thou wert cold or hot" (Rev. 3:15).

                     Little is known about the origin of the church at Laodicea. The
                   apostle Paul wrote an epistle to this church which has not been
                   preserved unless it is the letter we know as the "Epistle to the
                   Ephesians." (See Col. 4:16.) This may have been a circular letter
                   intended for the various churches in the province of Asia, but
                   sent first to Laodicea. (See Col. 1:7; 2:1; 4:12-16.)

                     What is Christ's opinion of His last church? Rev. 3:14-16.

                     A lukewarm people! The words are probably an allusion to the
                   hot springs at nearby Hierapolis. Flowing across the plateau,
                   the water grew cooler; and by the time it plunged over the cliff
                   opposite Laodicea, it had become lukewarm. Lukewarm water
                   nauseates the drinker. Jesus said, "I will spue thee out of my
                   mouth" (Rev. 3:16). And why does Christ prefer the ice cold and
                   the boiling hot over the nauseating lukewarm? "It would be
                   more pleasing to the Lord if lukewarm professors of religion
                   had never named His name. They are a continual weight to
                   those who would be faithful followers of Jesus. They are a
                   stumbling block to unbelievers."—Testimonies, vol. 1, p. 188.

                     What diagnosis does Jesus give to His last church? Rev.
                   3:17.

                      Laodicea possessed great wealth. When in AD 60 the city
                   suffered destruction by earthquake, Laodiceans refused the
                   financial aid offered them by the Roman emperor to rebuild the
                   city. This pride of the citizens of Laodicea was infectious. Chris-
                   tians caught the plague. "We need nothing," they felt. So long
                   as they kept this spirit, they were, indeed, beyond help.

THINK IT THROUGH     In what ways does Christ's diagnosis apply to His church
                   today?

                      "The Laodicean message applies to the people of God who
                   profess to believe present truth. . . . They profess to love the
                   truth, yet are deficient in Christian fervor and devotion. They
                   dare not give up wholly and run the risk of the unbeliever, yet
                   they are unwilling to die to self and follow out closely the
                   principles of their faith... .

          Part 2     What advice does Christ give His church?
        CHRIST'S
         ADIVCE      "I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou
                   mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be
                   clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear;
                   and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see"
                   (Rev. 3:18).

                     "I know all your ways," Jesus said, but "you do not know"
                   (verses 15, 17, NEB). To contradict the testimony of the True
                   Witness assures disaster.
                     Christ's advice fitted the real situation at Laodicea very well.
                   The city was famous for (1) gold handled by large banks; (2) the
                   manufacture of a soft and glossy black wool fabric; (3) a medical
                   school where physicians prepared the famous Phrygian eye
                   powder for the cure of eye inflammation. In contrast to these
                   assets Jesus called the believers wretched, poor, blind, and
                   naked.

                     What is the meaning of the gold, the white garments, and the
                   eyesalve? James 2:5; Gal. 5:6; 3:27; John 9:39-41; 16:8-11.

                     "The gold mentioned by Christ, the True Witness, which all
                   must have, has been shown me to be faith and love combined,
                   and love takes the precedence of faith."—Testimonies, vol. 2, p.
                   36.
                     "The white raiment is the righteousness of Christ that may be
                   wrought into the character. . . .
                     "The eye is the sensitive conscience, the inner light, of the
                   mind. Upon its correct view of things the spiritual healthfulness
                   of the whole soul and being depends. The 'eyesalve,' the Word
                   of God, makes the conscience smart under its application; for it
                   convicts of sin."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Com-
                   mentary, vol. 7, p. 965.

THINK IT THROUGH     In what ways does Christ's advice apply to me personally?

                     "Brethren and sisters, are your thoughts after this order?
                   'These sharp, decided words do not mean me; I am in a fairly
                   good condition spiritually, though I may not have all the fervor
                   and zeal that some have. I believe the truth. Those to whom this
                   message belongs may take it. I think some need it.' You who
                   think and reason thus, be assured that you are the very ones to
                   whom this message belongs. While the costly wares of heaven
                   are open before you, draw nigh and buy that which you have

Jesus and His People         LESSON 13                              ❑ Tuesday
                                                                  September 20

          Part 3  "As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous there-
      REPENTANCE fore and repent" (Rev. 3:19).

                      Though the church may, in effect, have forsaken its Head and
                   repudiated its Founder, Jesus Himself promised, "I will never
                   leave thee, nor forsake thee" (Heb. 13:5). Though the church
                   may have given up its love and its zeal, Christ's love is so broad,
                   so deep, so full, that He has reserved the most tender advice, the
                   greatest promise, the highest reward, for His church at
                   Laodicea. Why, then, do we continue to think lightly of the
                   riches of God's kindness, love, and mercy? Don't we know that
                   it is the goodness of the Lord that leads us to repentance?
                   (Rom. 2:4).

                    What does repentance mean for the church? Joel 2:13;
                   Mark 1:14, 15.

                     To praise God with our lips while our heart is far from Him is
                   characteristic of a lukewarm church. Repentance, in this con-
                   nection, means more than being sorry for one's misdeeds and
                   turning away from sin. It really means a change of heart!

                     Why is repentance such an urgent matter? Luke 13:3-5.

                     This message is especially relevant to the church of Laodicea.
                   Christ is coming. He is at the door, already knocking. Repent-
                   ance now means entrance into the eternal kingdom, or being
                   shut out from the presence of the Lord forever. Therefore, be
                   zealous, and repent.

THINK IT THROUGH     How can the church be led to repentance?

                      "It is when the vital principles of the kingdom of God are lost
                   sight of, that ceremonies become multitudinous and extrava-
                   gant. It is when the character building is neglected, when the
                   adornment of the soul is lacking, when the simplicity of godli-
                   ness is despised, that pride and love of display demand magni-
                   ficent church edifices, splendid adornings, and imposing
                   ceremonials. But in all this God is not honored. He values His
                   church, not for its external advantages, but for the sincere piety
                   which distinguishes it from the world. He estimates it according
                   to the growth of its members in the knowledge of Christ, accord-
                   ing to their progress in spiritual experience. He looks for the
                   principles of love and goodness."—Prophets and Kings, pp.

Jesus and His People         LESSON 13                           ❑ Wednesday
                                                                 September 21

           Part 4   "Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my
          CHRIST voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with
     IS KNOCKING him, and he with me" (Rev. 3:20).

                     Christ wants to enter into a new relationship with His people,
                   individually, ("If any man hear my voice—") and collectively as a
                   church. He stands at the door of each heart and wants to be
                   admitted. It is a visit from the lover of our soul, so beautifully
                   described in the Song of Solomon:
                     "Hark! my beloved is knocking.
                     'Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my perfect
                     one; .. . '
                     My beloved put his hand to the latch,
                     and my heart was thrilled within me.
                     I arose to open to my beloved."
                                                      Song of Solomon 5:2-5, RSV.
                     When this happens, the old world is gone; a new era has
                   begun; the believer is united with Jesus.

                     What happens when we open the door? Rev. 3:20.

                      No other image in Scripture illustrates more clearly the fel-
                   lowship and communion between Christ and His people than
                   that of partaking of food together. In traditional Eastern
                   societies, sharing food stands for sharing love and friendship; it
                   signifies reciprocity and interdependence, oneness, fellowship,
                   communion, equality, brotherhood, and mutuality. All of these
                   characteristics are implied in Christ's promise to "sit down to
                   supper" (NEB) with us. They are also a part of the relationship
                   when we celebrate the Lord's Supper.
                      Every time the Laodicean Church meets to partake of the
                   flesh and the blood of Jesus Christ, it is not only celebrating the
                   unity of the church with its Head, and the oneness of the mem-
                   bers; it is also reminded of its own condition that calls for
                   genuine repentance. Repentance, unity, and fellowship are a
                    guarantee that the church will soon celebrate the "wedding
                   supper of the Lamb."

THINK IT THROUGH      What is preventing me from opening the door to Christ?

                      "Jesus is knocking through the prosperity He gives you. He
                   loads you with blessings to test your fidelity, that they may flow
                   out from you to others. Will you permit your selfishness to
                   triumph? Will you squander God's talents, and lose your soul
                   through idolatrous love of the blessings He has given?" —Ellen

Jesus and His People           LESSON 13                               ❑ Thursday
                                                                      September 22

            Part 5   "To him who is victorious I will grant a place on my throne,
      A VICTORIOUS as I myself was victorious and sat down with my Father on his
           CHURCH throne" (Rev. 3:21, NEB).

                        The thought of being "victorious," of "overcoming," is a
                     recurring theme in the book of Revelation. Glorious are the
                     promises to those who overcome: They shall eat from the tree of
                     life and shall not taste the second death; they will receive a new
                     name and. white garments; they will be called the sons and
                     daughters of God and forever be in His presence. The specific
                     promise given to the believers at Laodicea is that they will sit
                     with Christ on the throne of God.

                       How can the Laodicean Church become a victorious
                     church? Rev. 12:11.

                       The form of the Greek verb used in Revelation 3:21 implies
                     that the believers "continue to overcome," "keep on winning."

                       How did Jesus remain victorious while on earth? John 8:28,
                     29; 14:30, 31.

                       The Scripture tells us that we shall be conquerors in Jesus
                     Christ (Rom. 8:37). As He has overcome the world, so will also
                     His church, if it perseveres in communion with Him who has all
                     the power in heaven and on earth. But the faith that overcomes
                     the world is the faith of Jesus. It implies a relationship that Christ
                     had with His Father. The Bible describes that relationship as
                     one of wholehearted obedience and trust, complete surrender
                     to the will of God, and humility. Christ became victorious by
                     making Himself a servant of all; His glorification followed His
                     obedience; His exaltation was a result of His humiliation.

THINK IT THROUGH       How can I be victorious through humility?

                       "In the kingdom of God, position is not gained through
                     favoritism. It is not earned, nor is it received through an arbitrary
                     bestowal. It is the result of character. The crown and the throne
                     are the tokens of a condition attained—tokens of self-conquest
                     through the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. . . .
                       " ... The one who stands nearest to Christ will be he who has
                     drunk most deeply of His spirit of self-sacrificing love,—love
                     that 'vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, .       seeketh not her
                     own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil' (1 Corinthians
                     13:4, 5),—love that moves the disciple, as it moved our Lord, to
                     give all, to live and labor and sacrifice even unto death, for the
                     saving of humanity."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 543.

Jesus and His People        LESSON 13                                  ❑ Friday
                                                                   September 23
         Part 6   "Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the
    THE CHURCH power of his might. Put on the whole armour of God, that ye
    STANDS FIRM may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil" (Eph. 6:10,
                11).

                     The church of Laodicea is the last church; it is the church at
                   the end of time. Knowing that his time is short, the devil un-
                   leashes in fury his whole array of weapons against the remnant
                   of God. Will the church stand firm?

                     How will the church stand firm amid the delusions of Satan
                   at the end of time? Eph. 6:10-18.

                      "Only those who have been diligent students of the Scrip-
                   tures and who have received the love of the truth will be
                   shielded from the powerful delusion that takes the world cap-
                   tive. By the Bible testimony these will detect the deceiver in his
                   disguise. To all the testing time will come. By the sifting of
                   temptation the genuine Christian will be revealed. Are the
                   people of God now so firmly established upon His word that
                   they would not yield to the evidence of their senses? Would
                   they, in such a crisis, cling to the Bible and the Bible only?"—
                   The Great Controversy, p. 625.

                    What is Christ's assurance to His church in these last days?
                   Matt. 28:18-20.

                     "Christ, the almighty Victor, holds out to His weary soldiers a
                   crown of immortal glory; and His voice comes from the gates
                   ajar: 'Lo, I am with you. Be not afraid. I am acquainted with all
                   your sorrows; I have borne your griefs. You are not warring
                   against untried enemies. I have fought the battle in your behalf,
                   and in My name you are more than conquerors."'—The Great
                   Controversy, p. 633.

THINK IT THROUGH     What in particular have I heard the Spirit say to the
                   churches?

                     "Christ has given to the church a sacred charge. Every
                   member should be a channel through which God can com-
                   municate to the world the treasures of His grace, the unsearch-
                   able riches of Christ... .
                           It is the privilege of every Christian, not only to look for,
                   but to hasten the coming of the Saviour.
                     "If the church will put on the robe of Christ's righteousness,
                   withdrawing from all allegiance with the world, there is before
                   her the dawn of a bright and glorious day. God's promise to her

                                                           Music, both secular and religious, is im-
                                                           portant in our lives. Ellen White gave much
                                                           counsel concerning music, but as we apply

                                                           What kind of music was she speaking of?
                                                           What kind was popular in her day? What
                                                           was her own background in music? Says
                                                           Mrs. White: "Those things which have
                                                           been in the past will be in the future. Satan
                                                           will make music a snare by the way in

                                                           Paul Hamel examines her statements on
