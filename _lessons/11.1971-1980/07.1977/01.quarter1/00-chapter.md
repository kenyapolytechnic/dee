#### Give Glory to God

## 1977 Quater 1
   Here is
a picture of
 a fortune.
                                 The widow's mite. It wasn't
                                 much. Yet it was
                                 everything. God isn't
                                 preoccupied with the
                                 amount we give but He is
                                 concerned with what's
                                 going on in our heart as we
                                 give. The widow's love
                                 made her gift a fortune!

                                 God has chosen to
                                 advance His work through
                                 you and your gift. But not
                                 by twisting your arm. He
                                 knows that if you've really
                                 given Him your heart, you'll
                                 also give your dollars.

                                 When you reach into your
                                 purse or wallet to support

                                 heart also. That's where
                                 God is looking when

         Open Heart
 Let God's love show through your giving.

    Fellow Sabbath School Members Around the World,

         Once more the thoughts of the world Sabbath Schools are turning
    toward the Northern Europe - West Africa Division. Sabbath Schools
    in nine European and nine African countries join in sending Christian
    Greetings to their brothers and sisters everywhere!

         So much that is good and fruitful has come from Sabbath School
    offerings. We thank you for helping make Newbold a strong and effective
    training college. Our high schools and colleges in Europe and West
    Africa rejoice in the 13th Sabbath overflows received.

          The Adventist Seminary of West Africa represents the accomplish-
     ments and hopes of the church in this region. Staffed by a mix of
     highly trained national and overseas workers, ASWA recently entered
     into an affiliation programme with Andrews University. This will
     enable our African students and workers to continue their advanced
     education within the church educational system. And now with your help
     we are building ASWA a brand new library and auditorium building.

          Severe overcrowding, the leasing of facilities in different parts
     of Oslo and restrictions on the use of more efficient equipment are
     among the reasons for rebuilding the Norwegian Publishing House.
     Another project which benefits this 13th Sabbath is in Finland where
     our Junior College at Toivonlinna desperately needs new buildings.
     We have already done some rebuilding. With your gifts to swell the
     funds available even more will be possible. The training of our
     Finnish workers depends on Toivonlinna, and the provision of adequate
     facilities at Toivonlinna depends on you.

          A mix of publishing and Christian education institutions seems a
     typically Adventist celebration of the Advent cause this coming 13th
     Sabbath. We thank you for past blessings shared with us and look for
     added expansion and success for the work of God in Northern Europe-
     West Africa through your support in March.

                God bless you.
                                                                        Sincerely~yeprs,

                        Studies in Christian Behavior
                                        Introduction

  "To give glory to God is to reveal His character in our own, and thus make Him
known. And in whatever way we make known the Father or the Son, we glorify
God."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 979.
    The first angel's message calls on God's people to "give glory to him [God]." Jesus
indicated that glory is given to God as a result of the good works of believers. These
lessons on Christian behavior are a study of how to give glory to God in our everyday
experience. By believers' Christlike behavior the character of God is held up before
the world, and the true Christian will give to God all the glory that results from it.
    This behavior of the Christian by which God is glorified results from faith in Jesus
Christ. These two—faith and behavior—must always be united. Ellen White, in Steps
to Christ, pages 57-61, discusses the danger of either behavior or faith standing
alone. Of behavior without faith she wrote:
    "The love of influence and the desire for the esteem of others may produce a
well-ordered life. Self-respect may lead us to avoid the appearance of evil. A selfish
heart may perform generous actions. By what means, then, shall we determine whose
side we are on?
    "Who has the heart? With whom are our thoughts? Of whom do we love to
converse? Who has our warmest affections and our best energies? If we are Christ's,
our thoughts are with Him, and our sweetest thoughts are of Him. All we have and are
is consecrated to Him. We long to bear His image, breathe His spirit, do His will, and
please Him in all things."—Page 58.
    Of faith without behavior she wrote:
    "That so-called faith in Christ which professes to release men from the obligation
of obedience to God, is not faith, but presumption. 'By grace are ye saved through
faith.' But 'faith, if it hath not works, is dead.' Ephesians 2:8; James 2:17. Jesus said of
Himself before He came to earth, 'I delight to do Thy will, 0 My God: yea, Thy law is
within My heart.' Psalm 40:8. And just before He ascended again to heaven He
declared, 'I have kept My Father's commandments, and abide in His love.' John 15:10.
The Scripture says, 'Hereby we do know that we know Him, if we keep His command-
 ments.... He that saith he abideth in Him ought himself also so to walk even as He
walked.' 1 John 2:3-6."—Page 61.
    These two dangers, behavior without faith and faith without corresponding be-
havior, should not frighten us off from a study of Christian ethics. These lessons on
 Christian behavior must be seen as faith seeking to know and to do God's will. Ellen
 White has urgently counseled the church about maintaining deportment distinct
 from the world:
    "As the truth is brought into practical life, the standard is to be elevated higher and
higher to meet the requirements of the Bible. This will necessitate opposition to the
 fashions, customs, practices, and maxims of the world. Worldly influences, like the
 waves of the sea, beat against the followers of Christ to sweep them away from the
 true principles of His meekness and grace; but we are to stand as firm as a rock to
 principle. It will require moral courage to do this, and those whose souls are not
 riveted to the eternal Rock will be swept away by the worldly current. We can stand
 firm only as our life is hid with Christ in God."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 146.
                                                                                          7

          MORALITY and to walk humbly with thy God?" (Micah 6:8). (See James
                    1:27.)

                       Ethics is the study of the rightness or wrongness of human
                     conduct or judgment. It includes the organization and analysis
                     of moral principles, and is thought of as the science of morals
                     and of moral conduct. Morality is the practice of right conduct
                     by a person, a community, or a nation. The moral person makes
                     a discrimination between right and wrong resulting in rectitude
                     of life and thought. Morality has to do with righteousness, vir-
                     tue, and justice.

                       What are some examples of how spokesmen for God en-

                     of the people? Jer. 22:3; 1 Cor. 6:6-10.

                        Systems of ethics have been developed by philosophers.
                     These may have a certain intellectual appeal, but they cannot be
                     accepted as the norm for Christians who live in the world but are
                     not of the world. (See John 17:15, 16.)
                        "Morality cannot be separated from religion. Conservative
                     tradition received from educated men and from the writings of
                     great men of the past are not all a safe guide for us in these last
                     days; for the great struggle before us is such as the world has
                     never seen. The brethren who have not acted a part in this work
                     in the past need to move with far greater caution in regard to
                     that which they accept and that which they refuse."—Medical
                     Ministry, p. 99.
                        One who has met and accepted Jesus as his Lord must ever
                     follow where He leads.
                        To stand approved of God is the highest goal of life.
                        "Of Job, the patriarch of Uz, the testimony of the Searcher of
                     hearts was, 'There is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an
                     upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil.' "—

                     from your observation of the lives of people?

                                                                    December 27

        SOURCES in truth. He loveth righteousness and judgment; the earth is
     OF MORALITY full of the goodness of the Lord" (Ps. 33:4, 5).
                   "If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that
                 doeth righteousness is born of him" (1 John 2:29).

                       Clubs, associations, family traditions, newspaper editorials,
                    and philosophical treatises are among the influences that pur-
                    port to provide wisdom on how to behave. But the Christian's
                    thoughts are tuned to another guidance system from which he
                    derives his ideals and inspiration. These are the same sources
                    from which he received his Christian faith at his conversion and
                    from which he draws daily strength to live. These sources are
                    not inherent in his nature or generated within himself but come
                    to him from above by interaction with God and His Holy Spirit.
                    They originate in the character and will of God as revealed to
                    man in the Bible and the inspired testimonies of His servant.
                       The idea of righteousness is ever associated with God, His
                    law, and all of His acts. (See Ps. 145:17; 19:9; Rev. 16:5.) Jesus
                    exhorted His listeners to be perfect even as their Father in
                    heaven is perfect (Matt. 5:48). In the Bible God has made a
                    self-disclosure of His nature, and to Him we can look for a
                    knowledge of the good and the right.

 THINK IT THROUGH     Give a summary of God's nature as revealed in the Bible.
                    How does divine nature contrast with unconverted human
                    nature?

                       "Many need to take frequent lessons from the life of Christ,
                    who is the Author and Finisher of our faith.... You are to show a
                    growth in the Christian graces. By manifesting meekness under
                    provocation and growing away from low earthliness you give
                    evidence that you have an indwelling Saviour, and every
                    thought, word, and deed attracts men to Jesus rather than to
                    self."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 597.
                       "All righteous attributes of character dwell in God as a per-
                    fect, harmonious whole, and every one who receives Christ as a
                    personal Saviour is privileged to possess these attributes."—
                    Christ's Object Lessons, p. 330.
                      "The character of God, His love manifested in giving His Son
                    to die for the world, and the beauty of holiness, are exalted
                    themes for contemplation. These will strengthen the intellect,
                    and bring man into close communion with the Infinite One."—

                                                                      December 28

             Part 3   "My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not" (Prov.
           DECISION 1:10).
                      "How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against
                    God" (Gen. 39:9)?

                        God has made man free in a very real sense. He is free to make
                     choices that involve every aspect of life—clothing, food, recrea-
                     tion, thoughts, work, marriage, religion, friends, hobbies, edu-
                     cation, money, and his relation to society.

                       When we have made a wrong decision, what does David's
                     experience teach us should be our attitude toward our mis-
                     take and toward God? 2 Sam. 24:10. (Compare 2 Cor. 7:9-11.)

                       There could be no moral meaning to life if humans did not
                     have this power to make choices. If they were made by nature so
                     that they acted rightly automatically, there would be no ground
                     to consider duty, conduct, or any standard of right; they would
                     only be responding to an unchosen impulse. But God has made
                     us with the power to decide, and herein lies responsibility for
                     our actions.

 THINK IT THROUGH      When discussing a situation, what does the use of the word
                     "ought" imply?

                        "In Pilgrim's Progress there is a character called Pliable.
                     Youth, shun this character. Those represented by it are very
                     accommodating, but they are as a reed shaken by the wind.
                     They possess no will power. Every youth needs to cultivate
                     decision. Adivided state of the will is a snare, and will be the ruin
                     of many youth. Be firm, else you will be left with your house, or
                     character, built upon a sandy foundation."—My Life Today,
                     p. 73.
                       "In the work of redemption there is no compulsion. No exter-
                     nal force is employed. Under the influence of the Spirit of God,
                     man is left free to choose whom he will serve. In the change that
                     takes place when the soul surrenders to Christ, there is the
                     highest sense of freedom. The expulsion of sin is the act of the
                     soul itself."—The Desire of Ages, p. 466.

Moral Principles      LESSON 1                                    ❑ Wednesday
                                                                   December 29
          Part 4   "I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou
        NEED OF shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye" (Ps. 32:8).
       GUIDANCE    "The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he
                 teach his way" (Ps. 25:9).

                    The Bible teaches that man's nature is sinful and depraved.
                  This being the case, how can man hope, unaided, always to
                  discern and choose the right and the good? Without divine aid
                  he is doomed to a life of trial and error and frequent defeat.
                    The sinner, his nature weakened through transgression, finds
                  that it is "impossible for him, in his own strength, to resist the
                  power of evil."—Steps to Christ, p. 17. It is equally true that he
                  cannot, without divine help, make the right choices.
                    One who endeavors to choose the right on the basis of human
                  reason has no assurance that his choice will be the right one.
                  The very faculties he employs in making a decision are subject
                  to the pride and selfishness of the natural human heart.

                     What is the source of sinful passions? Mark 7:21-23.

                     This is why the Christian, understanding the hazards of his
                   sinful condition, admits that he needs a revelation of truth from
                   outside himself and reaches out in faith to understand and
                   follow the will of God.
                      "The power of a higher, purer, nobler life is our great need.
                   The world has too much of our thought, and the kingdom of
                   heaven too little.
                      "In his efforts to reach God's ideal for him, the Christian is to
                   despair of nothing. Moral and spiritual perfection, through the
                   grace and power of Christ, is promised to all. Jesus is the source
                   of pbwer, the fountain of life. He brings us to His word, and from
                   the tree of life presents to us leaves for the healing of sin-sick
                   souls. He leads us to the throne of God, and puts into our mouth
                   a prayer through which we are brought into close contact with
                   Himself. In our behalf He sets in operation the all-powerful
                   agencies of heaven. At every step we touch His living
                   power."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 478.

     SOME CHRISTIAN faith with virtue, and virtue with knowledge, and knowledge
           VIRTUES with self-control, and self-control with steadfastness, and
                   steadfastness with godliness, and godliness with brotherly
                   affection, and brotherly affection with love" (2 Peter 1:5-7,
                   RSV). (Read also verses 2-4.)

                        Peter gives us herewith a dependable list of moral qualities to
                     be developed in our lives. There are other good lists in the Bible.
                     In Galatians 5:22, 23 is Paul's list of the "fruit of the Spirit," and
                     certainly these will be seen as one grows in Christian "gentle-
                     ness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance."

                       What virtues did Jesus teach would be characteristic of
                     citizens of the kingdom of heaven? Matt. 5:2-12.

                       The Christian will give evidence of these virtues in his daily
                     work as a craftsman, in carrying on his chosen profession, in his
                     business dealings, in his thoughts and words. Jesus
                     exemplified all of these high qualities in His life, and He is our
                     pattern.
                       "Who of us is faithfully following the Pattern? Who of us has
                     instituted and continued the warfare against pride of heart?
                     Who of us has, in good earnest, brought himself to wrestle with
                     selfishness until it should no longer dwell in the heart and be
                     revealed in the life?"—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 18.

THINK IT THROUGH        Which of the following is most important in influencing my
                     choices: church rules, attitude of friends, personal moral re-
                     sponsibility, pastor's sermons? Are my actions always mor-
                     ally right if my motive is good?

                        "He [Christ] laid aside His glory, His dominion, His riches, and
                     sought after those who were perishing in sin. He humbled Him-
                     self to our necessitaes, that He might exalt us to heaven. Sac-
                     rifice, self-denial, and disinterested benevolence characterized

                     we shall not be approved of God if we do not copy it and,
                     according to the ability which God has given, resemble it."—

       A CALL TO of life. Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips
  HIGH STANDARDS put far from thee. Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine
                 eyelids look straight before thee. Ponder the path of thy feet,
                 and let all thy ways be established. Turn not to the right hand
                 nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil" (Prov. 4:23-27).

                      It is woven into the very fabric of Christianity that one should
                    search to know the right and make that knowledge a pattern for
                    his own personal behavior.

                      In the striking words of an Old Testament prophet to God's
                    people, what are they admonished to do? Isa. 1:16, 17.

                       It is this striving to do the right, to know and follow God's will,
                    in cooperation with divine grace, that develops character. It is
                    our privilege to realize that whatever people may think of us,
                    God knows exactly what we are. Reputation is what the world
                    thinks of a man or a woman; character is what a person really is.
                    No one can injure one's character but he himself. Character is
                    the sword; reputation is the scabbard. When the gates of
                    heaven swing open to welcome the victors in life, their reputa-
                    tion will be left behind them; but their characters will be with
                    them through all eternity.

                      What are the six plus one things God hates? Prov. 6:16-19.

                      "Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire?" asks the
                    prophet, and then gives the answer: "He that walketh righte-
                    ously, and speaketh uprightly; . . . and shutteth his eyes from
                    seeing evil; he shall dwell on high" (Isa. 33:14-16).

 THINK IT THROUGH     What do you think is the role of Seventh-day Adventists
                    today in the fabric of the community where they live?

                       "The work of every true Christian is to represent Christ, to
                    reflect light, to elevate the standard of morals, and by words and
                    influences consecrated to God, to compel the careless and
                    reckless to think of God and eternity. The world would gladly
                    drop eternity out of their reckoning, but they cannot succeed so
                    long as there are those who represent Christ in their practical
                    life."—Selected Messages, bk. 1, p. 132.

       GOD CREATED hast crowned him with glory and honour. Thou madest him to
             MAN have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all
                   things under his feet" (Ps. 8:5, 6).

                       The Bible affirms that man was created by God in a special act
                     at a given time. It lends no support to the theory that man slowly
                     developed in response to the operation of natural law.

                       How is the God of the Bible distinguished from the gods of
                     the nations? 1 Chron. 16:26; Acts 17:24, 29.

                        God made man with a superior order of intelligence. The
                     brain in man is most mysterious and wonderful. The cortex,
                     which is the seat of thinking, judgment, speech, and memory, if
                     ironed out flat would be as large as a newspaper page, yet it is
                     far more than a clever computer.
                        "The most sophisticated cybernetic device is still a primitive
                     instrument when compared with the human brain."—Time,

                        God planned for man to be deeply involved in his earthly
                     environment points to the wisdom shown by God who created
                     man and the earth to be together. And it was all good; it exhi-
                     bited the vast intelligence of our great God, as Creator and
                     Sustainer of all.
                        The process of creation is something that we cannot under-
                     stand. We come closest to catching a glimpse into it as we listen
                     to the physicists tell us how matter can be converted into
                     energy. Creation is the reverse of this.
                        When we accept the fact of our creation by God, it is reason-
                     able also to accept as best His plan for the order of our lives. It
                     means listening to His voice, thinking His thoughts after Him,
                     and not only depending upon Him, but admiring Him, learning
                     from Him, yes, loving Him.

                     Creator, try to show from the Bible or your own observation
                     how our created world gives evidence of divine (1) purpose,
                     (2) wisdom, and (3) design.

                     from humanity, but from God only. We are His by creation and

     GOD CAME TO     yet sinners, Christ died for us" (Rom. 5:8).
REDEEM SINFUL MAN
                        In the middle of human history stands the cross of the
                     crucified One. He is both God and Creator, yet joined in com-
                     passion to the human race to redeem it.
                        Surely no study of ethics and morality can escape the lessons
                     and the judgments of that cross. The world had been beguiled
                     away from righteousness into sin, and because of that had
                     come under the sentence of death.
                        Were all men to die? Had they crossed a line, passed a point of
                     no return? Was their future hopeless? God had an answer full of
                     hope for all sinners. That plan culminated in Christ's cross, on
                     which He paid the penalty for our sins and made it possible for
                     us to receive by faith the merits of His sinless life record. What
                     more could He have done?
                        The redeeming sacrifice of Jesus draws us away from de-
                     fiance and revolt toward submission and obedience. It woos our
                     rebellious hearts with its message of love. It shows how the hard
                     sentence of judgment against sin may be diverted from the
                     repentant sinner, and he may step into that glorious freedom
                     awaiting all who repent and accept Jesus as Saviour.

                       In what way can we attain true freedom? John 8:36. What
                     result awaits those who ignore or neglect the proffered
                     grace? Heb. 2:2, 3.

                       In a world where cynicism of motives prevails, and skepticism
                     closes the prejudiced mind, the cross of Christ cries to us
                     inviting us to try to understand God's mind, His thought, His
                     will; and to turn to Him for redemption.
                       Jesus condemns all kinds of immoral behavior. He holds up a
                     pure, sinless pattern. Through Him we can attain an incorrupti-
                     ble crown that endures forever.

 THINK IT THROUGH      In what sense is Jesus the "desire of all nations" (Hag. 2:7)?
                     "THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS" (Jer. 23:6)?

                       "Men hate the sinner, while they love the sin. Christ hates the
                     sin, but loves the sinner. This will be the spirit of all who follow
                     Him. Christian love is slow to censure, quick to discern peni-
                     tence, ready to forgive, to encourage, to set the wanderer in the
                     path of holiness, and to stay his feet therein."—The Desire of

                                                                        January 4
            Part 3   "For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ;
          GOD WILL that every one may receive the things done in his body, ac-
        JUDGE MAN cording to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad" (2 Cor.
                   5:10).

                       Read also Eccl. 12:13, 14; Ps. 96:13; and Matt. 3:12.
                       Sin and evil always stand under the judgment of God. God
                     never condones what He has declared to be sin. He will never
                     accept sin as a viable way of life. He cannot be in favor of or on
                     the side of sin.

                       How is the one described who fails to take sin seriously?
                     Prov. 14:9. (Contrast Ps. 4:4.)

                        Christ's death "was the means through which an end was to
                     be finally made of sin and Satan, and his host to be
                     vanquished."—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 209.
                        Thus God has the moral right to destroy sin and those who
                     cling to it, and still be a righteous, loving God. But He is long-
                     suffering toward the sinner and wants him to escape the judg-
                     ment that finally falls upon those who refuse to separate from
                     sin.
                        When an individual consciously takes his stand with Christ
                     and identifies with His righteous life and His law, he must also
                     join Christ in His righteous judgment against sin. The mind of
                     Jesus with respect to sin must be our mind as well.
                        We must see God's judgment against sinners primarily as a
                     judgment against sin. If we are not agreeable to that the door of
                     redemption and reconciliation cannot open to us.

 THINK IT THROUGH      Why did Jesus say to the people of His time: "The men of
                     Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall
                     condemn it" (Matt. 12:41)? Have we any excuse if we also are
                     condemned in the judgment?

                        "The expectation of Christ's coming is to make men fear the
                     Lord, and fear His judgments upon transgression. It is to
                     awaken them to the great sin of rejecting His offers of mercy.
                     Those who are watching for the Lord are purifying their
                     souls by obedience to the truth."—The Desire of Ages, p. 634.
                        "The One who has stood as our intercessor; who hears all
                     penitential prayers and confessions; who is represented with a
                     rainbow, the symbol of grace and love, encircling His head, is
                     soon to cease His work in the heavenly sanctuary. Grace and
                     mercy will then descend from the throne, and justice will take
                     their place. He for whom His people have looked will assume His
                     right—the office of Supreme Judge."—Ellen G. White Com-

                                                                      January 5
         Part 4   What was the purpose stated by the Holy One for
    GOD IS RULER Nebuchadnezzar's predicted loss of reason and kingship?

                      "To the intent that the living may know that the most High
                    ruleth in the kingdom of men" (Dan. 4:17).

                       A scientist cited the orderly operation of the universe as
                    evidence that there is a big Engineer that operates the universe.
                    But he was thinking only of God's regulation of the heavenly
                    bodies that hang and move in space.
                       God claims rulership in another sphere, the area of human
                    events. We may neglect Him, or overlook Him, or ignore Him, or
                    even doubt His presence; but He is nevertheless very much
                    present, and we need to take into account His sovereign author-
                    ity in all our thoughts and plans. He is referred to in the Bible as
                    the God of heaven and the God of the earth (Gen. 24:3; 2 Kings
                    19:15; 2 Chron. 20:6).
                       To one who has chosen the way of God, He becomes an ever
                    present companion and guide. The life is yielded to His lord-
                    ship; He takes His place as King; His followers are His subjects.
                    And the relationship is not forced and harsh, but willingly ac-
                    cepted and cherished.
                       Here in this rebellious planet God wants His people to ac-
                    knowledge Him before the world. He wants them to witness to
                    the excellency of His rulership. They are to give evidence that
                    their lives are not prey to the shifting tides of human opinion,
                    but are anchored to eternal power and authority.

 THINK IT THROUGH     Are we sensitive and fearful lest we let others know that we
                    respect and obey a higher power? Do we show that we are out
                    of date when we acknowledge and honor God as our personal
                    Ruler?

                      "That which God purposes, man is powerless to disannul.
                    Even amid the working of evil, God's purposes have been mov-

         PART 5   Reflect on the Bible passage below. What does the symbol
MAN'S NEED OF GOD of the shepherd teach about God in His relation to men?

                        "The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to
                     lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still
                     waters. He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of
                     righteousness for his name's sake" (Ps. 23:1-3).

                        Without God man is incomplete, and spiritually and intellec-
                     tually lost. God has revealed Himself through His Written Word,
                     in nature, in Jesus Christ, and in His presence through the Holy
                     Spirit. How ignorant and how subject to deception we would be
                     without this revelation!
                        We live in the midst of enemies—diseases that threaten our
                     physical lives, and temptations that threaten our spiritual lives.
                     We are "made captive by Satan, and would have remained so
                     forever had not God specially interposed."—Steps to Christ, p.
                     17. Sin is man's mortal enemy, not his friend. The truth concern-
                     ing God and our world illuminates our minds and dispels the
                     darkness, showing us what we really are and what we may
                     become. The truth, God's truth, and not our own human
                     theories and judgments, makes us free.
                       Those who have traveled widely in the world know how
                     people seem to want to worship, to reach out to a power above
                     themselves. The animist in the jungle, offering some food on a
                     banana leaf to the spirits, may be worshiping out of wonder,
                     perhaps out of fear. How precious the knowledge of God is to
                     him as he learns of God's power and love and receives Jesus as
                     his Saviour.
                       Recall how the apostle Paul, visiting Athens, stood on Mars'
                     Hill and proclaimed the existence of the true God to his audi-
                     ence (Acts 17:22-31). The response was typical of the attitude of

 THINK IT THROUGH       In what ways does your knowledge of and faith in God give
                     you strength and hope? Can you imagine how you would face
                     life without Him?

                     spoken, listens to every prayer that is offered, tastes the sorrows

                     given to father, mother, sister, friend, and neighbor. He cares for

                                                                        January 7

         Part 6   "0 Come, let us worship and bow down; let us kneel before
 MAN'S RESPONSE the Lord our maker" (Ps. 95:6).
        TO GOD    "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God,
                that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable
                unto God, which is your reasonable service" (Rom. 12:1).

                     Here the relationship between God and us is outlined. He is
                   our Creator. He gives us life. He created us for a purpose. "In the
                   creation it was His purpose that the earth be inhabited by beings
                   whose existence should be a blessing to themselves and to one
                   another, and an honor to their Creator. All who will may identify
                   themselves with this purpose."—Education, p. 174.
                     Man's ideal response to God is to cease rebelling against Him
                   and to cooperate with Him. These two responses combine in a
                   person's acceptance of Jesus Christ.
                     "We are to surrender our hearts to God, that He may renew
                   and sanctify us, and fit us for His heavenly court. We are not to
                   wait for some special time, but today we are to give ourselves to
                   Him, refusing to be the servants of sin. Do you imagine you can
                   leave off sin a little at a time? Oh, leave the accursed thing at
                   once! Hate the things that Christ hates, love the things that
                   Christ loves. Has He not by His death and suffering made provi-
                   sion for your cleansing from sin?"—Selected Messages, bk. 1,
                   p. 327.

                     What effect will this close relationship with God have upon
                   our purposes, our judgments, our actions?

                     We come to Him in faith—Heb. 11:6.
                     We turn to Him in repentance—Ps. 38:18.
                     We confess and are forgiven-1 John 1:9.
                     He makes us new creatures in Christ-2 Cor. 5:17.

THINK IT THROUGH      Has there been a tendency lately in your life to think less
                   frequently of God or to be forgetful of Him? What is the basis of
                   your faith in God? Check those that apply: the Bible ( ) nature

                     "If you will seek the Lord and be converted every day; if you
                   will of your own spiritual choice be free and joyous in God; if
                   with gladsome consent of heart to His gracious call you come
                   wearing the yoke of Christ,—the yoke of obedience and
                   service,—all your murmurings will be stilled, all your difficulties

                                                                          •
                      Satan would like to see God's law defamed. He would like to
                    see the whole plan of redemption perverted by bringing about a
                    misunderstanding of the relation of the law to the gospel.
                      If there were no law, there would be no sin. Then the gospel
                    would lose its meaning, for it announces salvation from sin.
                    Then Christ would have died in a purposeless sacrifice, for His
                    death was to save people from sin, which would not exist with-
                    out the law.

                      What does the New Testament teach about God's Ten Com-
                     mandment law in relation to faith in Jesus? Rom. 3:31.

                        But what is the purpose of God's law? It is God's standard of
                     what is right and true. It expresses the mind of God (Ps. 40:8). It
                     declares the whole duty of man (Eccl. 12:13). The law ordains to
                     life those who keep its precepts (Rom. 7:10, 12). But man is not
                     standing where he was when created. He has left his original
                     relation to the law and the will of God. He is now under the law in
                     a relationship that makes it a ministration of death.
                        The law is an expression of God's character. To change the
                     law would mean either a change in God's character or a disas-
                     sociation of the law from His character. God will never do either
                     in order to extricate man from the dilemma of being condemned
                     by the law. The sin of disobedience must be dealt with in
                     another way. Obedience to God's law must continue to be the
                     standard of life for this world and the universe.

 THINK IT THROUGH       Is it possible for Christians actually to love God's law? Is it
                     possible to have love for the very precepts that measure our
                     lives and point out our sin? If we reach the point where we love
                     God's law, can sin have power over us?

                        "The law was not spoken at this time exclusively for the
                     benefit of the Hebrews. God honored them by making them the
                     guardians and keepers of His law, but it was to be held as a
                     sacred trust for the whole world. The precepts of the Decalogue
                     are adapted to all mankind, and they were given for the instruc-
                     tion and government of all. Ten precepts, brief, comprehensive,
                     and authoritative, cover the duty of man to God and to his fellow
                     man; and all based upon the great fundamental principle of
                     love."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 305.

    HIS PRECEPTS    "I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right;
                  and I hate every false way" (Ps. 119:128).

                      It is hazardous for us to substitute our unguided choice for
                    what God teaches in matters of morals and conduct. Nor is it
                    safe to look for guidance to our human reason in these matters.
                    Human reason has proved to be not always dependable. If
                    reason is to be the sole guide in moral problems, then only the
                    trained reasoner could know the right.
                      Jesus Himself illustrated how we should apply the teachings
                    and requirements of God's law to human situations. He showed
                    that the spirit and not just the letter should govern behavior.
                    (See Matt. 5:27, 28; 43, 44.) Human beings, finite and sinful,
                    need guidance in decision making. This guidance they can find
                    in the Bible; and the Spirit will enlighten them to know how to
                    apply the instruction to their living.

                      What is the key to true and ready obedience to the statutes
                    of God? Ps. 40:8; 119:77.

                      Many people associate the thought of law with unpleasant
                    restrictions on their actions, or maybe as something that will get
                    them into trouble. How shortsighted a view of the true nature of
                    the law! God's law provides the great guidelines of life, as the
                    compass at sea, or the map on the road.

 THINK IT THROUGH     Into what two sections are the Ten Commandments di-
                    vided? What do you think is the difference, if any, between the
                    laws of God and the laws of your city or state?

                       "It is as true now as when the words were spoken to Israel of
                    obedience to His commandments: 'This is your wisdom and
                    your understanding in the sight of the nations.' Deuteronomy
                    4:6.
                       "Here is the only safeguard for individual integrity, for the
                    purity of the home, the well-being of society, or the stability of

                    flicting claims the one safe and sure rule is to do what God says.

           ETERNAL  "All his commandments are sure. They stand fast for ever
         STANDARDS and ever, and are done in truth and uprightness" (Ps. 111:7, 8).

                       Ellen White wrote the following pertinent statement:
                        "Vice and crime, and iniquity of all kinds, are steadily on the
                     increase. The penetrating power of Bible truth must show the
                     contrast between truth and error."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 529.
                       It is amazing how people will try to accommodate standards
                     to fit the things they want to do. They rationalize concerning
                     what is right and what is duty so that a given type of conduct will
                     be socially approved. It is man's way of pandering to his lowered
                     stand ards and easing his conscience over his ethical shortcuts.
                        A holy and righteous God has established laws and standards
                     of conduct. God's laws do not change with each passing gener-
                     ation, sinking to a lower and still lower level as humankind
                     moves farther from Creation Day when God made man perfect.
                     Rather His statutes remain as beacons to give a steady, depend-
                     able light pointing the direction man should take.

                       How are children and grandchildren to learn correct princi-
                     ples? Deut. 6:6, 7.

                        God's laws do not deviate or shift as one goes from country to
                     country or from one type of civilization to another. With Him
                     truth is always truth; purity is ever purity; idolatry does not
                     cease to be idolatry; integrity is unchangeable.

 THINK IT THROUGH      Analyze Psalm 19:7-9, gathering out the various adjectives
                     that describe God's law. How can law be said to rejoice the
                     heart? Verse 8. Does morality depend on what we feel or on
                     what God declares?

                         "These monstrous doctrines [that the elect can never fall
                      from grace] are essentially the same as the later teaching of
                     popular educators and theologians—that there is 'no un-
                      changeable divine law as the standard of right, but that the
                      standard of morality is indicated by society itself, and has con-
                     stantly been subject to change. All these ideas are inspired by
                     the same master spirit—by him who, even among the sinless
                      inhabitants of heaven, began his work of seeking to break down

          Part 4   "Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the
        THE NEW prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say
      TESTAMENT unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall
     AND THE LAW in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled" (Matt. 5:17,18).

                       It is curious how some Christians have looked upon the Old
                    Testament times as the dispensation of law and the New Testa-
                    ment era as the dispensation of grace, as if the reign of law after
                    Christ had come to an end. Today's text refutes that concept. So
                    do other New Testament passages.
                       Notice Paul's comment on the use of the law, pointing out
                    how the law condemns lawlessness and disobedience. (See
                    1 Tim. 1:8-10.)
                       Recall how James argued that the law stands as a unit and we
                    are not at liberty to observe one part and ignore another. (See
                    James 2:10-12; 1:25.) Note that the apostle John taught that
                    followers of Jesus are under obligation to keep the command-
                    ments of Jesus. (See 1 John 2:4.)
                       No release from obedience to God's law and will exists in the
                    New Testament, though we search it from Matthew to Revela-
                    tion. Grace is offered, but not release from obedience. Surely
                    every true Christian would want it that way. Certainly as he
                    thinks upon life and duty, he wants his life to be free from sin.

                     What is the relationship between faith in Jesus and the law?
                    Rom. 3:31.

 THINK IT THROUGH     Ask yourself—Do I want to know the right, really desire to
                    follow it, to reject self-justification, to make no excuses for my
                    past conduct?

                      "God has given us His holy precepts, because He loves man-
                    kind. To shield us from the results of transgression, He reveals
                    the principles of righteousness. The law is an expression of the
                    thought of God; when received in Christ, it becomes our
                    thought. It lifts us above the power of natural desires and tend-
                    encies, above temptations that lead to sin. God desires us to be
                    happy, and He gave us the precepts of the law that in obeying
                    them we might have joy. When at Jesus' birth the angels sang,—
                       'Glory to God in the highest,
                       And on earth peace, good will toward men' (Luke 2:14), they
                    were declaring the principles of the law which He had come to
                    magnify and make honorable."—The Desire of Ages, p. 308.

Standards and Principles            LESSON 3                           ❑ Thursday
                                                                        January 13
          Part 5   "By this we know that we love the children of God, when we
         LOVE IS love God, and keep his commandments. For this is the love of
     COMMANDMENT God, that we keep his commandments: and his command-
         KEEPING ments are not grievous" (1 John 5:2, 3).

                        Christian love, as it fills the heart, does not draw the posses-
                     sor away from keeping God's commandments. Love that per-
                     tains to God would necessarily be an upright, obedient, moral
                     love.
                        Love for a neighbor or associate would never allow us to
                     wrong him, to treat him shabbily, to be less than honest and true
                     with him and faithful to his best interest. Love for God will result
                     in our honoring Him through obedience as well as in singing His
                     praise.
                        A feeling of love does not make our every act or judgment
                     right without regard to what God teaches us is right. The princi-
                     ple of love is the fulfilling of the law. (See Rom. 13:10.) Senti-
                     mentality could lead us astray with regard to our love to our
                     fellowmen and to God, and His love to us. Neither God's love nor
                     our love relieves us from the necessity of having regard for
                     God's precepts.

                       Is it Paul's intention in Romans 6:14, 15 to teach that keep-
                     ing God's law is not required? Explain.

                        Because of their wrong conduct Adam and Eve were cast out
                     of the Garden; Satan and one third of the angels of heaven were
                     cast out; Saul lost the kingship of the nation of Israel; and
                     Ananias and Sapphira suffered the sentence of death.

 THINK IT THROUGH      What are your motives for obeying God? Love? Loyalty?
                     Fear? Social pressure? Reward?

                        Notice how Revelation 14:12 reads in the new English Bible:
                     "This is where the fortitude of God's people has its place—in
                     keeping God's commands and remaining loyal to Jesus."
                        "God's great object in the working out of His providences is to
                     try men, to give them opportunity to develop character. Thus He
                     proves whether they are obedient or disobedient to His com-
                     mands. Good works do not purchase the love of God, but they
                     reveal that we possess that love. If we surrender the will to God,
                     we shall not work in order to earn God's love. His love as a free
                     gift will be received into the soul, and from love to Him we shall
                     delight to obey His commandments."—Christ's Object Les-

                                                                       January 14
          Part 6  "This is the covenant that I will make with them after those
         LAW IN days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in
       THE HEART their minds will I write them" (Heb. 10:16).

                     God's laws written in the hearts of His children is the purpose
                   of the gospel. Without the law written there, the Christian is in
                   danger of being a cold legalist, smug in spiritual blindness.

                    Who is the power that promotes spiritual blindness in the
                   minds of those that believe not? 2 Cor. 4:4.

                      A knowledge of the law and of one's own shortcomings can
                   leave one with a "certain fearful looking for of judgment" (Heb.
                   10:27). In fact, of ourselves we are unable to keep God's law and
                   we remain under God's disapproval. But if we are will-
                   ing to comply with God's plan, He has two ways to deal with our
                   human impossibilities:
                      1. He writes His law in our hearts, making us willing and
                   cooperative as regards the keeping of His holy law. The Holy
                   Spirit does this writing in the "fleshy tables of the heart" (2 Cor.
                   3:3).
                      2. When we do our best in carrying out God's will and fall
                   short, we still have an advocate in "Jesus Christ the righteous"
                   (1 John 2:1).
                      The goal of the plan of salvation is to restore the image of God
                   in man and to bring about righteousness in his life. So the
                   penitent sinner experiences the new birth, submitting to the
                   writing of God's law in his heart, and constantly growing in
                   grace and a knowledge of God. (See 1 John 2:29.)
                      "If we abide in Christ, if the love of God dwells in us, our
                   feelings, our thoughts, our purposes, our actions, will be in
                    harmony with the will of God as expressed in the precepts of His
                    holy law.. . . .
                      "The condition of eternal life is now just what it always has
                    been,—just what it was in Paradise before the fall of our first
                    parents,—perfect obedience to the law of God, perfect righ-
                    teousness... .
                      ". . . If you give yourself to Him, and accept Him as your
                    Saviour, then, sinful as your life may have been, for His sake you
                    are accounted righteous. Christ's character stands in place of
                    your character, and you are accepted before God just as if you
                    had not sinned."—Steps to Christ, pp. 61, 62.

      NESS OF GOD
                     Only if God is truthful do we have a firm basis for the hope of
                   salvation. He has said that if we come to Him in contrition He will
                   forgive us (1 John 1:9); if we thirst for righteousness we shall be
                   satisfied (Matt. 5:6); Jesus will provide for Hischildren a home in
                   heaven (John 14:2, 3); the redeemed become heirs of all the
                   gospel promises and benefits (Gal. 3:29; Titus 3:7). God has
                   pledged His word and is fully on record as to His plans for this
                   world and those who believe Him.

                        How does God describe His own character? Ex. 34:6.

                         We have every reason to believe that God is truthful, that we
                     can accept His word and put our full trust in Him. It is true that
                     His statements regarding us are often conditional, and the out-
                     come will depend on our response or attitude. The Bible gives
                     abundant evidences of God's truthfulness and dependability. It
                     illustrates how His word has been proved. The most prominent
                     and important of these are the Messianic prophecies recorded
                     in the Old Testament. These prophecies promised the Mes-
                     siah's coming, even giving time, place, and many other details.
                     One list, gleaned from the Old Testament, gives 46 different
                     aspects of His coming. All of these were exactly fulfilled in the
                     New Testament record. Christ's acts and words made His work
                     and the purposes of His Father in heaven believable to the
                     listeners.

                       What did Jesus' adversaries acknowledge concerning
                     Him? Matt. 22:16.

                       How important in our lives are the words "faith." "trust,"
                     "belief," "confidence," "assurance" with respect to God!

THINK IT THROUGH       Can you think of incidents in your experience that have led
                     you to the belief that God is trustworthy?

                        "As a child, Jesus manifested a peculiar loveliness of disposi-
                     tion. His willing hands were ever ready to serve others. He
                     manifested a patience that nothing could disturb, and a truth-

        THE FATHER ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode
           OF LIES not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he
                   speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the
                   father of it" (John 8:44).

                        The description of Satan, the devil, is a very uncomplimentary
                     one, yet not overdrawn. Jesus in heaven had every reason to
                     know the character of Satan, and on earth He branded him a liar.
                     In most societies this is the most insulting term that can be used
                     of an adversary. Yet Christ did not hesitate to use it of Satan.

                       In what condition are those who accept the ways of Satan?
                     2 Tim. 2:26.

                        The word "devil" literally means "slanderer." Satan has
                     shown this characteristic again and again. He slandered the
                     character of God and the fairness of His government before the
                     angels of heaven, speaking falsehoods and misrepresenting
                     God's nature and His purposes. In the Garden of Eden the devil
                     lied about God to Eve and Adam and by his insinuations and
                     temptations brought about their moral fall. As a liar Satan was
                     expelled from heaven (Rev. 12:9) and will never regain resi-
                     dence there; nor will his children. (See Rev. 22:15.)

                       What reason is inferred in Second Corinthians 11:13,14 why
                     Satan would want to masquerade as an angel of light?

                       "Disguised as an angel of light, he [Satan] will walk the earth
                     as a wonder-worker. In beautiful language he will present lofty
                     sentiments. Good words will be spoken by him, and good deeds
                     performed. Christ will be personified, but on one point there will
                     be a marked distinction. Satan will turn the people from the law
                     of God."—Fundamentals of Christian Education, pp. 471, 472.

 THINK IT THROUGH     Can you think of lies that are being circulated today about
                     God to deceive people so they will not turn to Him?

                        "Now [after Christ's ascension] the guilt of Satan stood forth
                     without excuse. He had revealed his true character as a liar and
                     a murderer. It was seen that the very same spirit with which he
                     ruled the children of men, who were under his power, he would
                     have manifested had he been permitted to control the inhabi-
                     tants of heaven. He had claimed that the transgression of God's
                     law would bring liberty and exaltation; but it was seen to result
                     in bondage and degradation."—The Great Controversy, p. 502.

                                                                            January 18
             Part 3     What two traits does Paul link together in Ephesians 4:15?
          SPEAKING
         THE TRUTH      "Rather, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in
                      every way into him who is the head, into Christ" (Eph. 4:15,
                      RSV). (Read also Eph. 4:29; 5:4.)

                         Speaking the truth is a precious Christian virtue and one of
                      the brightest evidences of Christian morality. There is such a
                      lack of it that one who always speaks the truth even to his own
                      hurt becomes marked in a community and becomes known as a
                      person of the highest integrity.
                         Always to be truthful and honest sets a student apart when,
                      for example, he refuses to cheat in a school examination even
                      when he could easily do so.
                         There are said to be some cooks who, when asked to give a
                      choice recipe to a friend, leave out an important ingredient
                      rather than to disclose the full truth and the secret of their
                      success.
                         Children are expected to be truthful with their parents. But
                      are parents always scrupulously honest with their children? Do
                      parents have a freedom to lapse from the truth that is not
                      allowed to children?
                         Also, what about truthfulness in one's work? In each business
                      or profession there are special temptations to evade the truth.
                      Can you think of a time when someone was grievously wronged
                      by not being told the truth? Should an employer tell the
                      employee the truth, and vice versa? Also, in what spirit? A long
                      list of questions could be compiled covering the subject of
                      truthfulness.

 THINK IT THROUGH       In what other ways besides speaking a lie can a person
                      convey an untruth?

                         "Life's best things—simplicity, honesty, truthfulness, purity,
                      integrity—cannot be bought or sold. They are as free to the
                      ignorant as to the educated, to the humble laborer as to the
                      honored statesman."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 198.
                         "A slight deviation from truth, a little variation from the re-
                      quirements of God, is thought to be, after all, not so very sinful,
                      when pecuniary gain or loss is involved. But sin is sin, whether
                      committed by the possessor of millions or by the beggar in the
                      streets."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 311.
                         "The Lord requires of all who profess His name a strict ad her-
                      ence to truth. This will be as salt which has not lost its savor, as a
                      light amid the moral darkness and deception of the world."—

                                                                      January 19
          Part 4   "In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin: but he that
   WORDINESS AND ref raineth his lips is wise" (Prov. 10:19).
    TALEBEARING    "He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that
                 repeateth a matter separateth very friends" (Prov. 17:9).

                      While some people by nature are withdrawn and quiet, in
                    contrast some are talking incessantly. What is the nature of all
                    this talking? Much of it may be pointless; it doesn't edify or
                    instruct. Often it is about the individual who is doing the talking
                    and then it can become extremely boring. Again it rambles on
                    about all the common acquaintances and may include a gener-
                    ous amount of gossip.
                      The Bible states some very clear principles about speech.
                      1. The mouth discloses what is in the heart (mind) (Matt.
                    12:34, 35).
                      2. Corrupt communication is condemned (Eph. 4:29).
                       3. The tongue needs to be bridled (James 1:26; Ps. 39:1).
                       4. Speech should be used to communicate our hope (1 Peter
                    3:15).
                       5. Our words will be reckoned as a factor in the judgment
                    (Matt. 12:36).
                      6. Controlling the mouth avoids trouble (Prov. 21:23; Matt.
                    5:37).
                       7. Speech should minister grace (Eph. 4:29).
                       Talebearing (gossip) comes in for special condemnation
                    (Lev. 19:16). Solomon says that a person of "a faithful spirit"
                    conceals rather than reveals an evil report (Prov. 11:13).
                       There must have been a great deal of this wanton gossip in
                    Israel, for there is so much said against it. It was also pointed out
                    and condemned in the New Testament church (1 Tim. 5:13).

 THINK IT THROUGH     "The spirit of gossip and talebearing is one of Satan's spe-
                    cial agencies to sow discord and strife, to separate friends,
                    and to undermine the faith of many in the truthfulness of our
                    positions."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 195.

                       It might be profitable for each one to make some new resolu-
                    tions about his future exercise of speech.
                       "Upon every family, upon every individual Christian, is laid
                    the duty of barring the way against corrupt speech. When in the
                    company of those who indulge in foolish talk, it is our duty to
                    change the subject of conversation if possible. By the help of
                    the grace of God we should quietly drop words or introduce a
                    subject that will turn the conversation into a profitable,
                    channel."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 337.

Our Words and Witness            LESSON 4                             ❑ Thursday
                                                                       January 20
             Part 5   "Therefore thou art inexcusable, 0 man, whosoever thou
          CRITICISM art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou con-
                    demnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things"
                    (Rom. 2:1).

                       Whether it is called judging or criticism, it is of the same
                     nature. It reflects one's own sins and comes under the condem-
                     nation of the Bible. Jesus condemned it and labeled the one
                     who practices it a hypocrite (Matt. 7:1-5). Christ's words sound
                     in our ears today, and we should listen to them: "He that is
                     without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her" (John
                     8:7).
                       Especially must we be careful not to put a stumbling block in
                     the path of a brother (Rom. 14:13).
                       The principal reason Christians should refrain from criticiz-
                     ing and judging is that they cannot understand the heart and
                     read the motives correctly. Therefore judgment must be left to
                     God (Rom. 14:10). Eventually all circumstances both good and
                     bad will be made plain (1 Cor. 4:5).

                       What was God's reaction to the criticism of Moses by Aaron
                     and Miriam, his brother and sister? Num. 12:1-10.

                        Leaders of the church have often been subjected to critical
                     attitudes and unkind judgments. Ellen White penned an admon-
                     ition worthy of our attention today:
                        "Let those who have used the talent of speech to discourage
                     and dishearten God's servants, who are striving to advance
                     God's cause, planning and working to master hindrance, ask
                     God to forgive them for the injury they have done to His work by
                     their wicked prejudices and unkind words. Let them think of the
                     harm they have done by spreading false reports, by judging
                     those they have no right to judge."—Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 84.

 THINK IT THROUGH      While we should not criticize others, what is the value of
                     self-criticism? Where should this be done? In open confes-
                     sion? In secret?

                        "We want to show to the world that we have a faith that is
                     elevating, that it makes us kind, courteous, self-denying; and
                     begets in us love and reverence for God, and makes us Christian
                     ladies and gentlemen. We must pray more earnestly for the
                     grace of Christ which is essential for us if we preserve our
                     integrity and spiritual life. If any one comes to you and begins to
                     tell you of the faults of another, if you cannot stop that voice in
                     any other way, lift your voice and sing the Doxology. Vain talkers
                     and mischiefmakers are Satan's agents in doing his work."—

                                                                      January 21

                armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left"
                (2 Cor. 6:4-7).

                      The world is full of false messiahs, of elusive cures for the
                    world's evils, of voices that deny truth, and of ignorance and
                    misunderstanding of God and His government. Jesus came not
                    only to redeem man but also to expose error and to reveal God's
                    character. His teaching had-the ring of authority and carried its
                    own verification (John 7:46). He declared that the truth would
                    set men free (John 8:32).

                     What descriptive word is often applied to the gospel in the
                    New Testament? 1 Tim. 2:4; Heb. 10:26; 2 Peter 2:2.

                      We are making the highest use of the power of speech when
                    we use it to proclaim God's truth, either in a public way or in
                    private to a friend. "The power of speech is a talent that should
                    be diligently cultivated. Of all the gifts we have received from
                    God, none is capable of being a greater blessing than this. With
                    the voice we convince and persuade, with it we offer prayer and
                    praise to God, and with it we tell others of the Redeemer's
                    love."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 335.
                      The apostle Peter was a ready speaker, but his speech could
                    at times be impetuous and ill-advised. However, after Peter was
                    converted, his talent of speech enabled him to preach that
                    mighty Spirit-filled sermon on the Day of Pentecost when
                    thousands were led to receive Christ. A ready tongue, con-
                    verted, is an asset, not a handicap.

 THINK IT THROUGH     What can I do to make my voice heard in teaching the truth?

                       "Wherever we are, we should watch for opportunities of
                    speaking to others of the Saviour. If we follow Christ's example
                    in doing good, hearts will open to us as they did to Him. Not
                    abruptly, but with tact born of divine love, we can tell them of
                    Him who is the `Chiefest among ten thousand' and the One
                    'altogether lovely.' Cant. 5:10, 16. This is the very highest work
                    in which we can employ the talent of speech. It was given to us
                    that we might present Christ as the sin-pardoning Saviour."—

            Part 1   "Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever
     CULTIVATING AN things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever
      HONEST MIND things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever
                   things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be
                   any praise, think on these things" (Phil. 4:8).

                        We are to take account of and let all of these Christian virtues
                      play an active part in the life. Here is a course of mental activity
                      that is truly fruitful and constructive. Ethical decisions require
                      the cultivating of ethical thinking. Some may even say that
                      dishonesty is usually premeditated. Then those who strive for
                      good actions should prepare the mind, for to live right one must
                      learn to think right. Here the will comes into play by rejecting
                      dishonorable schemes and covetous ambitions from the
                      thoughts. Paul put the necessity for doing this succintly: "Cast-
                      ing down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself
                      against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every
                      thought to the obedience of Christ" (2 Cor. 10:5). A good way to
                      accomplish this is to preoccupy the mind with worthy projects
                      and positive, constructive activities. The true end of life is not to
                      acquire money or goods or fame, but to develop character.
                        "You are responsible to God for the indulgence of vain
                      thoughts; for from vain imaginations arises the committal of
                      sins, the actual doing of those things upon which the mind has
                      dwelt. Govern your thoughts, and it will then be much easier to
                      govern your actions."—Testimonies, vol. 3, pp. 82, 83.

                        Where do sinful acts have their roots? Prov. 24:9; Matt.
                      15:19.

 THINK IT THROUGH       If conscience tells me that I have done something that is not
                      scrupulously honest, what is my duty?

                         "This [applying Philippians 4:8] will require earnest prayer
                      and unceasing watchfulness. We must be aided by the abiding
                      influence of the Holy Spirit, which will attract the mind upward,
                      and habituate it to dwell on pure and holy things. And we must
                      give diligent study to the word of God.... 'Thy word,' says the
                      psalmist, 'have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against
                      Thee.' "—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 460.

                                                                           January 24
          Part 2   "Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to
     DEVIOUSNESS morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee. Devise not evil
                 against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee"
                 (Prov. 3:28, 29).

                      People become so infatuated by the charm of the things of
                    this world that they go to uncommon lengths to achieve their
                    material objectives. Sometimes the individual not only works
                    hard to reach his goal, but also he may take unfair advantage of
                    others to benefit himself. Deviousness almost always implies
                    laying a plan that will take advantage of another's gullibility,
                    ignorance, or trust.

                      What moral lessons are there in the story of Jacob and
                    Esau? Gen. 25:29-33; 27:1, 15-19, 30-33, 41.

                      The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 1, p. 606 mentions situations
                    where individuals deviate from the straight way: "They steal
                    who conceal goods from a customs inspector or misrepresent
                    them in any way, or who make out false or misleading tax
                    returns, or who cheat tradesmen by incurring debts that they
                    can never repay, or in view of impending bankruptcy, turn over
                    their property to a friend, with the understanding that it is later
                    to be restored, or who have recourse to any so-called tricks of
                    trade."
                       "Devious" literally means "off the road"—and as applied in
                    society means departing from a right, accepted, or common
                    course; therefore not being straightforward. In other words it
                    means "tricky."
                       As we come to the end of each day and we are alone with our
                    thoughts, does a feeling of peace steal over us, or is there
                    remorse for an act that cannot pass the searching eye of our
                    God? There is a way in which peace can be sought and found.

 THINK IT THROUGH      Proverbs 15:8 states that "the prayer of the upright is his
                    [the Lord's] delight." In view of this, how can we delight God
                    with our prayers?

                       "When a man is indeed connected with God, and is keeping
                    His law in truth, his life will reveal the fact.... He will not sell his
                    honor for gain. His principles are built upon the sure founda-
                    tion, and his conduct in worldly matters is a transcript of his
                    principles. Firm integrity shines forth as gold amid the dross
                    and rubbish of the world. Deceit, falsehood, and unfaithfulness
                    may be glossed over and hidden from the eyes of man, but not
                    from the eyes of God."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 310.

            Part 3    "Divers weights, and divers measures, both of them are
          ETHICS IN alike abomination to the Lord."
          BUSINESS    "It is naught, it is naught, saith the buyer: but when he is
                    gone his way, then he boasteth" (Prov. 20:10, 14).

                        The Word of God portrays men in all their greedy humanness,
                     and the picture is not attractive. Commonly accepted standards
                     of t hee commercial world may place achievement above strict
                     integrity. The Bible penetrates behind the business deal and
                     investigates the mechanism by which it was carried off: "Divers
                     weights," "divers measures," "a false balance (verse 23)," all
                     are hateful to God. Notice other dishonest practices con-
                     demned in the Bible: (1) lying about a lost article (Lev. 6:3); (2)
                     holding back wages (Jer. 22:13; James 5:4); (3) non-payment of
                     debts (Ps. 37:21).
                        "Especially in these days when the keen edge of morality is
                     becoming increasingly dull, it is well to remember that adultera-
                     tion, concealment of defects, the misrepresentation of quality,
                     and the employment of false weights or measures are all the
                     acts of a thief as much as pocket picking or shoplifting.
                        "Employees steal when they . . . appropriate that which has
                     not been expressly agreed upon, or neglect to do whatever work
                     they contracted to do, or perform it in a slovenly manner, or
                     damage the owner's property through carelessness or diminish
                     it by waste."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 1, p. 606.
                        God condemns the practice of being too close in dealing in
                     business matters. "Those who profess to be waiting and watch-
                     ing for the appearance of their Lord should not disgrace their
                     profession by bantering in deal and standing for the last
                     penny."—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 239.

THINK IT THROUGH       In what respects can I more faithfully apply the golden rule
                     in business transactions?

                        "In all business transactions, we are to let the light shine
                     decidedly. There is to be no sharp practice. Everything is to be
                     done with the strictest integrity. Better consent to lose some-
                     thing financially than to gain a few shillings by sharp practice.
                     We shall lose nothing in the end by fair dealing. We are to live
                     the law of God in our world, and perfect a character after the
                     divine similitude. All business, with those in the faith and those
                     not in the faith, is to be transacted on square, righteous

                                                                    January 26
         Part 4   "And with him was Aholiab, son of Ahisa mach, of the tribe of
    A WORKMAN'S Dan, an engraver, and a cunning workman, and an embroi-
        ETHICS derer in blue, and in purple, and in scarlet, and fine linen" (Ex.
                38:23).

                       The work of a skilled craftsman is something to be admired.
                    The higher the quality of the work and the more artistic and
                    flawless its finish, the more does it testify to the workman's
                    opinion of the importance of his calling. Shoddiness is ever
                    disappointing, especially when the workman or workwoman is
                    capable of doing better. Work well done always gives satisfac-
                    tion both to the one who does it, as well as to the one for whom it
                    is performed. Turn a garment over and examine the workman-
                    ship; check the fitting as you judge the work of a dressmaker or
                    a tailor. Listen to the purr of an engine in perfect tune after
                    repairs by a master mechanic. Observe the cabinet work in a
                    kitchen, the laying of the floors and the finishing of doors and
                    doorways, as you inspect a newly finished house. Then judge
                    whether you think it is quality work.
                       In today's highly organized society a large share of the popu-
                    lation depends upon tradesmen to keep the houses painted, the
                    radios playing, the electricity and water flowing, the clothes
                    manufactured, the dents removed from a crumpled automobile
                    fender, and even the bread baked. Applying Christian ethics to
                    the workman, every task undertaken would be done faithfully,
                    with the best possible skill, and great satisfaction would result.

                     If the laborer is entitled to his just wages, paid promptly, to
                    what is the employer entitled?

                       The conclusion that Christian principles apply to our daily
                    work is unavoidable. This is certainly what we would speak of as
                    applied ethics.
                       "Those who do nothing for their employers except that which
                    is commanded them, when they know that the prosperity of the
                    work depends on some extra exertion on their part, will fail to be
                    accounted faithful servants."—Messages to Young People,

          DOCTRINE by the open statement of the truth we would commend our-
                   selves to every man's conscience in the sight of God" (2 Cor.
                   4:2, RSV).

                       Paul had a passion to see the Scriptures used honestly, not
                     wresting them from their true meaning. He admonished
                     Timothy to be a good workman in the gospel calling, "rightly
                     handling the word of truth" (2 Tim. 2:15, RSV).

                       If there is an innate honesty in our lives in regard to God and
                     His truth, how will this witness for the cause of Christ? 2 Cor.
                     8:21.

                        Scripture must not be quoted to justify an improper practice
                     in one's life. Nor is it honest to choose just what portions are
                     wanted and to disregard the rest. Every use we make of a
                     passage of Scripture must fit in harmoniously with the whole
                     pattern of its teaching. "Each passage of Scripture must be
                     given its true meaning even as every brick in the wall of a
                     building must be in its proper place, or the whole wall suffers....
                     Irrelevancies and secondary issues are to be subordinated to
                     the principles that actually prepare men to conquer sin and
                     enable them to live triumphantly in Christ."—SDA Bible Com-
                     mentary, vol. 7, pp. 336, 337.
                        The principle of using the Scriptures honestly applies also to
                     the use and interpretations of the writings of Ellen White. To
                     quote out of context, or to otherwise wrest the meaning of
                     passages is a dishonest practice condemned by Ellen G. White

       MERCY TO confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy" (Prov.
   THE REPENTANT 28:13).

                      One of the duties of the Holy Spirit is to help a sinner be
                    honest with himself. Otherwise, he will never take the steps of
                    repentance and confession. (See John 16:8.)

                      What is the sin against the Holy Ghost, and how does it
                    operate? Matt. 12:31, 32.

                      "Light comes to the soul through God's word, through His
                    servants, or by the direct agency of His Spirit; but when one ray
                    of light is disregarded, there is a partial benumbing of the
                    spiritual perceptions, and the second revealing of light is less
                    clearly discerned. So the darkness increases, until it is night in
                    the soul."—The Desire of Ages, p. 322.
                      At the same time the wrongdoer must take the additional
                    steps of ceasing his dishonest practice and seeking to resist all
                    future temptation in the strength of God. (See Phil. 2:13; 1 Cor.
                    10:13). Sins to which the dishonest person has been clinging
                    must be removed in God's way—they cannot be carried over
                    into the eternal world. Can it be imagined that there will be
                    dishonesty of any type in heaven?
                      The purpose of confession and repentance is to remove from
                    the life of the sinner the wrong practices and the accompanying
                    guilt feelings that stand between him and God. When we receive
                    Jesus as our Sin Bearer He can put our doubts to rest and heal
                    our wounded souls.

                                                                        January 30

 WORK—ITS VALUE that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough"
    AND DIGNITY (Prov. 28:19).

                        As we review Bible history, we see many examples of people
                     at work earning their daily bread. Jesus was a worker. Carpentry
                     was His trade; and His example of industry is for our learning.
                     Paul was a tent maker. Dorcas is recorded as a seamstress;
                     David a shepherd; several of the disciples were fishermen.

                       What incidents show that work activity was not looked upon
                     as degrading by the sons of the prophets? 2 Kings 6:1-7.

                       Briefly, what activities are mentioned in the list of charac-
                     teristics of a "virtuous woman" in Proverbs 31:10-31?

                         In the industrial societies today are found the "white-collar"
                     and "blue-collar" workers. In a total organization it is necessary
                     that some be supervisors and some workers. But all share in the
                     dignity of work, and all draw their rewards from its successful
                     accomplishment. No work, no task, is in itself degrading if it is
                     necessary for the health and well-being of the whole group, and
                     if it is performed in a workmanlike manner.
                         Some tasks are much more pleasant than others. Around the
                     home such jobs as cleaning or washing the clothes or the
                     dishes are often looked upon as the least glamorous in the
                     round of duties. On the farm, the workers would much rather
                     gather in the harvest than to clean out the stalls of animals or
                     mend fences and roads. Always, in all processes, there are the
                     tedious, unavoidable jobs that take patience and perseverance.
                     But none of them can be neglected lest all suffer as a conse-
                     quence.

 THINK IT THROUGH      How can one best be happy in his work? Is it wrong to seek
                     advancement in one's work activity or calling?

                        "At the creation, labor was appointed as a blessing. It meant
                     development, power, happiness. The changed condition of the
                     earth through the curse of sin has brought a change in the
                     conditions of labor; yet though now attended with anxiety,
                     weariness, and pain, it is still a source of happiness and de-
                     velopment. And it is a safeguard against temptation. Its disci-
                     pline places a check on self-indulgence, and promotes industry,
                     purity, and firmness. Thus it becomes a part of God's great plan
                     for our recovery from the Fall."—Education, p. 214.

                   "Labour not to be rich: cease from thine own wisdom" (Prov.
                 23:4).

                      Many of our outlooks on life are affected by our attitude
                    toward money or wealth. The Bible has quite a little to say about
                    wealth, both the acquiring and the use of it. Wealth in itself is not
                    condemned; in fact some Bible characters who are mentioned
                    as serving God were blessed with it, such as Abraham (Gen.
                    13:2), Solomon (1 Kings 10:23), and Job (1:3). Riches as such do
                    not have a moral quality, but the one who uses them does.
                    Character is to be valued above riches. "A little that a righteous
                    man hath is better than the riches of many wicked" (Ps. 37:16).
                    One makes a mistake if he trusts to riches (Prov. 11:28). Espe-
                    cially are we warned about the method used in gathering riches
                    (Prov. 21 :6; 28:8). Because of the dangers that lurk in riches, the
                    Bible writer chose the middle road. "Give me neither poverty
                    nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me: lest I be full,
                    and deny thee, and say, Who is the Lord? or lest I be poor, and
                    steal, and take the name of my God in vain" (Prov. 30:8, 9).

                      Is the ability to acquire wealth readily, as seen in some
                    individuals, a gift bestowed by God? If so, what is the respon-
                    sibility of its possessor? (See Deut. 8:17, 18.)

                       The admonition of Proverbs 23:4, "Labour not to be rich," is a
                    warning against making selfish gain the goal of life. It is an
                    admonition against permitting money to be the chief motivating
                    force in the life. The rapid accumulation of riches to the point
                    where one is able to retire while young and give the rest of his
                    life to idleness and pleasure seeking is not a blessing. Work has
                    its benefits through all the life, from the earliest to the latest
                    years.

 THINK IT THROUGH     What are the main purposes in my work? to make a living?to
                    do a job well? to get rich? to leave money for my family? to
                    have something for the church and those in need? What
                    changes should I make?

                       "It is God who gives men power to get wealth, and He has
                    bestowed this ability, not as a means of gratifying self, but as a
                    means of returning to God His own. With this object it is not a sin
                    to acquire means.... The Bible condemns no man for being rich
                    if he has acquired his riches honestly. It is the selfish love of
                    money wrongfully employed that is the root of all evil."—

            Part 3   What three aspirations did Paul recommend to the Thes-
         AMBITION salonian believers, and why?
         INDUSTRY
                     "To aspire to live quietly, to mind your own affairs, and to
                   work with your hands, as we charged you; so that you may
                   command the respect of outsiders, and be dependent on no-
                   body" (1 Thess. 4:11, 12, RSV).

                        The apostle Paul had little sympathy for idlers and gave a
                     good personal example to the believers, for he said, "We were
                     not idle when we were with you, we did not eat any one's bread
                     without paying, but with toil and labor we worked night and day,
                     that we might not burden any of you" (2 Thess. 3:7, 8, RSV). And
                     a little farther in the text he said, "If any one will not work, let him
                     not eat" (verse 10).
                        Regarding the situation among the Thessalonians it is said
                     that some were teaching that in view of the second advent it was
                     too late to work at ordinary pursuits. As a result, some had
                     stopped working for a livelihood and were depending for sup-
                     port upon the generosity of their brethren.
                        In the book of Proverbs diligence is extolled (Prov. 10:5;
                     6:6-11; 24:30-34). In the Psalms is given a pleasant picture of the
                     contented family life of a workingman who fears God: "Thou
                     shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy shalt thou be, and it
                     shall be well with thee. Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine at the
                     sides of thine house: thy children like olive plants round about
                     thy table" (Ps. 128:2, 3). Surely God wants us to be busy and
                     contented. The reward of the righteous in the new earth is that
                     they will labor and produce and enjoy the fruitage of their
                     labors. (See Isa. 65:21-23.)

 THINK IT THROUGH      In view of the nearness of the end, should I continue to work
                     as usual, work harder, or take life more easily? Give reason
                     for your answer.

                        "Life is too solemn to be absorbed in temporal and earthly
                     matters, in a treadmill of care and anxiety for the things that are
                     but an atom in comparison with the things of eternal interest.
                     Yet God has called us to serve Him in the temporal affairs of life.
                     Diligence in this work is as much a part of true religion as is
                     devotion. The Bible gives no indorsement to idleness. It is the
                      greatest curse that afflicts our world. Every man and woman
                     who is truly converted will be a diligent worker."—Christ's Ob-

The Christian and His Living            LESSON 6                     ❑ Wednesday
                                                                       February 2
          Part 4   "Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, and look
        PRUDENCE well to thy herds. For riches are not for ever: and doth the
                 crown endure to every generation?" (Prov. 27:23, 24).

                      A Christian should develop a wholesome philosophy or out-
                    look toward his daily work, money, and property. As a Christian
                    philosophy it must take the principles of God's Word into ac-
                    cou nt.
                      The Bible urges prudence in planning, the use of foresight
                    with respect to the business of life. The one who raises cattle,
                    sheep, or fowl is careful to keep disease away from his animals;
                    the tiller of the soil treats the land carefully lest it be depleted or
                    eroded and its value diminished.

                      The book of Proverbs counsels financial prudence. What
                    are some of the guidelines advocated? (See Prov. 3:9, 10;
                    10:4; 11:15; 29:24.)

                      The modern man gets insurance on his home and other pos-
                    sessions, but he also applies this principle of prudence to his
                    own life and family. He guards his health, retaining his vigor as
                    long as possible through the best of health habits. He sends his
                    children to school so that they will be prepared to cope with life
                    in this modern world. Prudently he chooses a Christian school
                    for them, for he is thinking of their eternal future. In all this he is
                    not acting from selfish motives, but as a good steward of all that
                    God has placed in his care.

 THINK IT THROUGH     What moral principles are involved when we let ourselves
                    and our affairs be ruled by inclination or thoughtlessness or
                    the poor example of others?

                      "God does not condemn prudence and foresight in the use of
                    the things of this life, but the feverish care, the undue anxiety,
                    with respect to worldly things is not in accordance with His
                    will."—Counsels on Stewardship, p. 159.
                      Ellen White, in 1869, wrote to a couple who looked to others
                    for financial help. In part she said:
                      "I was shown that you, my brother and sister, have much to
                    learn. You have not lived within your means. You have not
                    learned to economize. If you earn high wages, you do not know
                    how to make it go as far as possible. You consult taste or
                    appetite instead of prudence. At times you expend money for a
                    quality of food in which your brethren cannot afford to indulge.
                    Dollars slip from your pocket very easily."—Testimonies, vol. 2,

            Part 5  "So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich
     USES OF MONEY toward God" (Luke 12:21).

                        The moral consideration is not the amount of money we have,
                     be it great or small, but the use we make of it. Review the parable
                     of the selfish rich man who thought only of himself and his
                     well-fortified future, and suddenly reached the end and found
                     all he had accumulated to be useless (Luke 12:16-21). Also,
                     think of Cornelius, that Gentile centurion who was not only
                     devout but also charitable, and was marked by God as one to
                     whom the Christian gospel must be opened (Acts 10:1-6). We
                     might also keep in mind the case of Achan whose cupidity
                     brought disaster to the whole nation of Israel (Joshua 7:1).
                     Among these examples of people and their possessions we
                     could remember the lad with five barley loaves and two small
                     fishes whose offering Jesus took and blessed and had it distrib-
                     uted among five thousand (John 6:9-11). We all like the story of
                     Zacchaeus, the short man who wanted to see Jesus, and when
                     that moment came he opened his heart to the Master, telling
                     how he exercised stewardship over his possessions (Luke 19:8).
                        The subject of investments is a broad one and should have
                     our spiritually sensitized attention. Ellen White, speaking of
                     investments in her time, commented on investments in busi-
                     ness interests in cities, in patents, in secret organizations, in the
                     publishing work, in earthly speculations, in God's cause, and a
                     number of other types. She speaks of Satan's pleasure in having
                     God's people make investments in worldly enterprises.

 THINK IT THROUGH      What principles should guide the people of God in making
                     investments today?

                      If my life story were to be recorded between the covers of a
                     modern Bible, what would be the record regarding the use of
                     my money?

                       "Our money has not been given us that we might honor and
                     glorify ourselves. As faithful stewards we are to use it for the
                     honor and glory of God. Some think that only a portion of their
                     means is the Lord's. When they have set apart a portion for
                     religious and charitable purposes, they regard the remainder as
                     their own, to be used as they see fit. But in this they mistake. All
                     we possess is the Lord's, and we are accountable to Him for the
                     use we make of it."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 351.

                                                                       February 4
          Part 6   "The thief must give up stealing, and instead work hard and
        LABORING honestly with his own hands, so that he may have something
        TO SERVE to share with the needy" (Eph. 4:28, NEB).

                      What a remarkable transition is described by Paul in this
                    verse, in which one who has been a thief stops his thieving, finds
                    a useful, remunerative job, and gets the spirit of helping others
                    who are worse off than he is.
                       "It is a Christian privilege to give to those in need, those who
                    would perish without such aid. The making of money for its own
                    sake is not a Christian activity. . .. The believer works in order
                    that he may be able to help others after having discharged his
                    obligation to society by supporting himself. Thus he lives in
                    marked contrast with the thief."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol.
                    6, p. 1028.
                       Money represents labor, our own if we earned it, someone
                    else's if it was acquired without our labor.
                       Notice how Paul recounts the training he had given the
                    church members in his last charge to the elders of the Ephesian
                    church (Acts 20:35). He here quotes words of Jesus found
                    nowhere else. The receiver of charity is relieved and made
                    happy, but a greater blessing comes to the one who gives, who
                    shares the fruit of his labor. And also, he has God's approval.
                    (See Matt. 25:34-36.)

                      What feeling should brethren show for each other? 1 Peter
                    3:8.

 THINK IT THROUGH     Make a list of several ways in which Christians may "labor
                    to serve," and think whether you have been using any of these
                    ways.

                      "Money has great value, because it can do great good. In the
                    hands of God's children it is food for the hungry, drink for the
                    thirsty, and clothing for the naked. It is a defense for the op-
                    pressed, and a means of help to the sick. But money is of no
                    more value than sand, only as it is put to use in providing for the
                    necessities of life, in blessing others, and advancing the cause
                    of Christ."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 351.

         RESOURCES
                       How much do we owe to God? First, He gave us our world and
                    fashioned it so that the human race could live on it with all its
                    needs supplied. God gives all men life and strength (Isa. 42:5;
                    Ps. 29:11). Above every other ability God has given men intelli-
                    gence (Dan. 2:21; James 1:5).
                       All that men and women can accomplish in scientific, techni-
                    cal, and industrial progress comes from the Creator. We may
                    manufacture an automobile, but the raw materials come from
                    the earth, and the intelligence to do it, from God.
                       When Europeans and Asians became aware of the existence
                    of the Western Hemisphere, hitherto unrealized, a great reser-
                    voir of riches was opened for the wide use of the human race. It
                    had rich soil, great stands of virgin timber, clean, fresh sources
                    of water and water power, and minerals in abundance. These
                    included gold, silver, copper, iron, nickel, and many other valu-
                    able metals; and the valuable fossil fuels—coal, oil, and gas.
                    And the whole continent was teeming with animal life. All of
                    these tremendous resources contributed to the wealth of the
                    New World, and on no basis could those who came to use and
                    possess them assert that they themselves made this wealth. It is
                    the same story in any part of the world, Australia, Africa, or the
                    islands of the sea.

                      acknowledgment about their new home? Ps. 66:10-12.

                        The Christian recognizes the source of all he possesses and
                      labors for. He knows in his heart that he is indebted for all to God
                      and His blessing (1 Tim. 6:17). In other words, he is simply God's
                      continuous agent or manager.

 THINK IT THROUGH        Is it a test of character for one to possess riches? For whom
                      is the love of money a test?

                      character like His. They are on trial. God wants to see whether
                      they will prove themselves worthy of the eternal riches. If they
                      use their Lord's goods to set themselves above their fellowmen,
                      they prove unworthy of a place in the kingdom of God."—

 IDENTIFICATION OF unto him that fell among the thieves" (Luke 10:36)?
   ONE'S NEIGHBOR
                      What a wonderful world we would enjoy if every one felt the
                    spirit of true neighborliness toward every other person! The
                    spirit of a neighbor is one of helpful interest in the happiness
                    and well-being of others. This parable of the Good Samaritan
                    shows that the spirit of true compassion has no social or ethnic
                    or class boundaries. The spirit of charity leads one always to
                    work "no ill to his neighbour" (Rom 13:10).

                      What are some manifestations of the neighborly spirit? Ex.
                    23:1; Lev. 6:2-4.

                       But again, who is that neighbor? It is not just the prosperous
                    friend with whom we enjoy happy association. It is also the one
                    who suffers, who lacks, who is neglected and overlooked. We
                    need not wait to acknowledge him as neighbor until we know
                    his religion, or nation, or family, or caste. When he comes to our
                    attention and a need is apparent, he qualifies as our neighbor. A
                    homeless flood victim or an earthquake victim halfway around
                    the world is our neighbor. Though in distant lands a leprosy or
                    "savage fire" patient, or an orphaned child all qualify as our
                    neighbors. One who lives just down the street and attends
                    church without a coat, or a widow, a shut-in, who cannot get to
                    church is a neighbor. The neighbor may worship in a different
                    church or not in any church, but the Bible puts him in the class
                    of neighbor to his Christian brethren. Why should the Christian
                    love his neighbor as himself? Because he serves that kind of
                    God (Lev. 19:18; Matt. 5:44, 45).

 THINK IT THROUGH     Are there any new neighbors in your area with whom you
                    have not become acquainted? Perhaps they are waiting for a
                    call.

                      "Thus the question, 'Who is my neighbor?' is forever
                    answered. Christ has shown that our neighbor does not mean
                    merely one of the church or faith to which we belong. It has no
                    reference to race, color, or class distinction. Our neighbor is
                    every person who needs our help. Our neighbor is every soul
                    who is wounded and bruised by the adversary. Our neighbor is
                    everyone who is the property of God."—The Desire of Ages, p.

                                                                          February 8
             Part 3   "The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth
          PRAISE OF shall be watered also himself. He that withholdeth corn, the
         LIBERALITY people shall curse him; but blessing shall be upon the head of
                    him that selleth it" (Prov. 11:25, 26).

                        What a blessing when the ownership of property and means,
                     and the possession of a God-given spirit of compassion, come
                     together in the same person! Here the Christian sense of stew-
                     ardship is at its bounteous best as possessions are shared
                     generously and intelligently to help sustain causes and persons
                     that will suffer unless charity does its good work. The practice of
                     liberality will be marked in God's record particularly when the
                     gift is given privately and without ostentation and with no
                     thought of reward or recognition. For example, a Christian
                     young lady working as a secretary has quietly been contributing
                     a good portion of her income to a fund for students in need,
                     feeling that this is the area where God has shown her she can
                     best serve His cause.
                        The opposite picture, revealed in the text, is that of one who
                     takes advantage of his economically advantaged position and
                     uses his power to create a condition that will further enrich
                     himself. It is the old practice of getting a "corner on the market,"
                     so as to raise the price artificially, so that the manipulator can
                     make an excessive profit. In time of drought or other sources of
                     crop failure, the one who happens to have a good crop might
                     have many people at his mercy and demand especially high
                     prices for his hoard of grain, for food or for seed. Notice what
                     the prophet Amos (ch. 8:4-7) had to say about selfish merchan-
                     dising.

                       What is the difference between stinginess and economy?

                       It is not the amount involved, but the spirit behind it that
                     counts. (See 1 Cor. 13:3.) Rich, poor, and moderately poor are
                     on the same spiritual basis in the sight of God.

 THINK IT THROUGH     Do you think God might entrust us with more money if He felt
                     we would make better use of it?

                       "Christ sanctions no lavish or careless use of means. His
                     lesson in economy, 'Gather up the fragments that remain, that
                     nothing be lost,' is for all His followers (John 6:12). He who
                     realizes that his money is a talent from God will use it economi-
                     cally, and will feel it a duty to save that he may give.
                       "The more means we expend in display and self-indulgence,
                     the less we can have to feed the hungry and clothe the
                     naked."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 352.

The Christian and Human Need                LESSON 7                ❑ Wednesday
                                                                      February 9
          Part 4   "Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in
      REBUKE FOR the power of thine hand to do it" (Prov. 3:27).
          GREED    "He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house; but he
                 that hateth gifts shall live" (Prov. 15:27).

                      Greed has a close relative in covetousness; and these two
                    corroding characteristics can coexist quite comfortably in the
                    same mind.

                      What is the Lord's attitude toward the covetous? Ps. 10:3.

                      These traits of character grow like noxious weeds in the soil
                    of the unredeemed human heart. They can be choked out with
                    the love that flows from a heart made new. Greediness and
                    glorying in one's possessions is in a special sense a denial of
                    God. (See Job 31:24, 25, 28.) Possessions have then become a
                    god. The prophet Isaiah spoke of some people as "greedy
                    dogs" (Isa. 56:11), a term that is certainly not complimentary.
                      Jesus warned against the spirit of greed and covetousness:
                      "Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth" (Matt. 6:19).
                      "You cannot serve God and Money" (Matt. 6:24, NEB).
                      "He also that received seed among the thorns is he that
                    heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitful-
                    ness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful"
                    (Matt. 13:22).
                      God plans that Christians shall bear fruit to His glory and the
                    benefit of His cause on earth.

 THINK IT THROUGH     In what way does our attitude toward money and "things"
                    reveal the depth of our Christian experience?

                        "The love of money was the ruling passion in the Jewish age.
                    Worldliness usurped the place of God and religion in the soul.
                    So it is now. Avaricious greed for wealth exerts such a fascinat-
                    ing, bewitching influence over the life that it results in pervert-

                    are drowned in perdition."—Thoughts From the Mount of Bless-
                    ing, pp. 88, 89.
                        "Hoarded wealth is not merely useless, it is a curse. In this life
                    it is a snare to the soul, drawing the affections away from the
                    heavenly treasure. In the great day of God its witness to unused
                    talents and neglected opportunities will condemn its

            Part 5   "Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also
        RECOGNIZING shall cry himself, but shall not be heard" (Prov. 21:13).
             NEED    "He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack: but he that
                   hideth his eyes shall have many a curse" (Prov. 28:27).

                        In many countries today there are government agencies that
                     help the poor and unfortunate of society. Nevertheless there is
                     still a need for church agencies and various private organiza-
                     tions to operate assistance programs. It is proper for Christians
                     to favor and assist in all these worthy enterprises.
                        However, all of these avenues of practical service do not
                     excuse a Christian from giving personal attention to the needs
                     of individual cases that he encounters. To close his eyes against
                     them or to harden his feelings and to turn the other way is
                     unworthy of the name of Christian that he bears. The purpose of
                     charity is not display or to earn the favor of Heaven; but "sincer-
                     ity of purpose, real kindness of heart, is the motive that Heaven
                     values."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 81.

                       What perversion of charity did the Pharisees practice in the
                     time of Jesus? Matt. 6:1.

                        Although the self-centered reason for charity noted here is
                     condemned, there is a benefit for the unselfish giver. "The work
                     of beneficence is twice blessed. While he that gives to the needy
                     blesses others, he himself is blessed in a still greater
                     degree."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 82. A faith-
                     ful Christian is one alert to the cry for help arising in the world
                     around him.

 THINK IT THROUGH      Does your church have a fund to help the poor, and do you
                     contribute to it? Is that all you need to do for the poor and
                     needy?

                        "All His [the Lord's] gifts are to be used in blessing humanity,
                     in relieving the suffering and the needy. We are to feed the
                     hungry, to clothe the naked, to care for the widow and the
                     fatherless, to minister to the distressed and downtrodden. God
                     never meant that the widespread misery in the world should
                     exist. He never meant that one man should have an abundance
                     of the luxuries of life, while the children of others should cry for
                     bread. The means over and above the actual necessities of life
                     are entrusted to man to do good, to bless humanity."—Christ's

         Part 6   "In a severe test of affliction, their abundance of joy and
     MACEDONIAN their extreme poverty have overflowed in a wealth of liberality
      CHURCHES on their part. For they gave according to their means, of their
                own free will" (2 Cor. 8:2, 3, RSV).

                      The example of the Macedonian believers stands out as a
                    brilliant example of planned benevolence. They had suffered
                    severely from persecution (Acts 17:5-9; 2 Thess. 1:4-6). They
                    were so poor that they seemed to be utterly destitute.
                      "The abysmal poverty of Macedonia at this time was due to
                    several factors. Three wars had desolated the area. . . . So
                    desperate was the condition of the Macedonians that they had
                    petitioned the emperor Tiberius for a reduction of taxes. Fur-
                    thermore, most of the early Christians came from the poorer
                    classes of society."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 888.
                      The example of the Macedonian churches teaches that pov-
                    erty is never absolute, it is only relative. Even the poorest needs
                    the spiritual exercise that comes from sharing. In the case of the
                    poor there is danger that they indulge in bitterness and self-pity
                    and do not sense that the privilege of stewardship is for them
                    also. It is possible for the poor to be stingy as well as the rich,
                    and Christian liberality applies as well to one as to the other.

                     What was the fruit John the Baptist told the multitude they
                    must bear? Luke 3:9-11.

 THINK IT THROUGH    What place has benevolence in character development?
                    Would your answer be true for both rich and poor?

                       "Nearly all the Macedonian believers were poor in this world's
                    goods, but their hearts were overflowing with love for God and
                    His truth, and they gladly gave for the support of the gospel....
                       "The willingness to sacrifice on the part of the Macedonian
                    believers came as a result of wholehearted consecration."—
                    The Acts of the Apostles, p. 343.
                       "In the balances of the sanctuary the gifts of the poor, made
                    from love to Christ, are not estimated according to the amount
                    given, but according to the love which prompts the sacrifice.
                    The promises of Jesus will as surely be realized by the liberal
                    poor man, who has but little to offer, but who gives that little
                    freely, as by the wealthy man who gives of his abundance."—

      THE CREATOR'S shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh" (Gen.
             PLAN 2:24).

                         God created Adam and Eve, the original pair that began the
                     biological process by which the earth was to be peopled. God
                     established the institution of marriage and it carries the divine
                     endorsement. It did not arrive after ages and ages in a long and
                     tedious process of development; nor did it happen by accident.
                     It is a part of God's design, basic to the needs and happiness of
                     man.

                       In His earthly mission, what was Jesus' intention with re-
                     gard to the marriage institution? Matt. 19:5, 6.

                        "He [Jesus] came not to destroy the sacred relationship of
                     marriage, but to exalt it and restore it to its original sanctity."—
                     The Adventist Home, p. 121.
                        Marriage is one of the most sensitive areas of Christian deci-
                     sion making. There is a rightness and wrongness, based on
                     God's Word, relating to one's treatment of the opposite sex and
                     to marriage. The times and customs may change and become
                     evil like the days of Noah and of Sodom, but God's plan for the
                     relationships between men and women stands vindicated in the
                     lives of His followers.
                        The question of the relation of men and women is not basi-
                     cally asocial question or a legal one, but is at heart a theological
                     one having to do with an individual's relation to God, and involv-
                     ing his spiritual nature. Jesus, at the beginning of His earthly
                     ministry, was invited to a wedding in Cana and gave the event
                     His approval, not only by attending, but also by performing His
                     first miracle there. (See John 2:1-11.)
                        The relation of husband and wife in marriage is used in the
                     Bible to illustrate the relation between Christ and the church,
                     one of honor and sacrifice of self in behalf of the other in love.
                     (See Eph. 5:23-27; Hosea 2:19, 20.)

 THINK IT THROUGH       Is there any significance in the fact that marriage is prac-
                     ticed all over the world?

                         "God Himself gave Adam a companion. He provided 'an help
                     meet for him'—a helper corresponding to him—one who was
                     fitted to be his companion, and who could be one with him in
                     love and sympathy.... A part of man, bone of his bone, and flesh
                     of his flesh, she was his second self, showing the close union
                     and the affectionate attachment that should exist in this
                     relation."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 46.

        Part 2  "What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put
      MARRIAGE asunder" (Mark 10:9).

                     "In the youthful mind marriage is clothed with romance, and it
                  is difficult to divest it of this feature, with which imagination
                  covers it, and to impress the mind with a sense of the weighty
                  responsibilities involved in the marriage vow. This vow links the
                  destinies of the two individuals with bonds which naught but
                  the hand of death should sever.
                     "Every marriage engagement should be carefully considered,
                  for marriage is a step taken for life. Both the man and the woman
                  should carefully consider whether they can cleave to each other
                  through the vicissitudes of life as long as they both shall
                  live."—The Adventist Home, p. 340.
                     Polygamy occurred in the Old Testament times in Israel, but
                  by New Testament times monogamy had become the estab-
                  lished form of marriage among the Jews. Marriage was alwayg'
                  intended by God to be for life between two committed partners.
                  (See Matt. 19:8, 9.)
                     "Like every other one of God's good gifts entrusted to the
                  keeping of humanity, marriage has been perverted by sin; but it
                  is the purpose of the gospel to restore its purity and beauty....
                     "The grace of Christ, and this alone, can make this institution
                  what God designed it should be—an agent for the blessing and
                  uplifting of humanity. And thus the families of earth, in their
                   unity and peace and love, may represent the family of heaven.
                     "The condition of society presents a sad comment upon
                   Heaven's ideal of this sacred relation. Yet even for those who
                   have found bitterness and disappointment where they had
                   hoped for companionship and joy, the gospel of Christ offers a
                   solace."—The Adventist Home, p. 100.
                      "Let those who are contemplating marriage weigh every sen-
                   timent and watch every development of character in the one
                   with whom they think to unite their life destiny. Let every step
                   toward a marriage alliance be characterized by modesty,
                   simplicity, sincerity, and an earnest purpose to please and
                   honor God. Marriage affects the afterlife both in this world and
                   in the world to come. A sincere Christian will make no plans that

          Part 3   "This is the will of God, that you should be holy: you must
      PROMISCUITY abstain from fornication; each one of you must learn to gain
                 mastery over his body, to hallow and honour it, not giving way
                 to lust like the pagans who are ignorant of God" (1 Thess.
                 4:3-5, NEB).

                        The word "abstain" in this passage has a negative sound, and
                     in the thinking of many moderns the negatives are not to rule.
                     However we must recall that all of God's Ten Commandments
                     except one and part of another one, are stated negatively, the
                     better to act as a deterrent against sin.
                        "Abstain from fornication" (1 Thess. 4:3).
                        "Thou shalt not commit adultery" (Ex. 20:14).
                        These are laws of Christian living and are for our guidance
                     and protection.
                        Man is more than an animal, although in many respects his
                     body functions similarly to that of certain animals. Man has
                     more than a brain; he has a mind. He has more than a nervous
                     system that responds to instinct, or to learned stimuli; he can be
                     guided by reason, will, and conscience. He was given dominion
                     over the earth. He was created a being to be held responsible for
                     the consequences of his acts. He was meant to love God and to
                     put God's will above his own self-pleasing desires.

                       Can you think of some important reasons why social, family,
                     and religious inhibitions on sexual conduct should be
                     safeguarded and not abandoned?

 THINK IT THROUGH      What is the meaning of the question heard in some wedding
                     services: Wilt thou keep thyself wholly unto him (her) so long
                     as you both shall live?

                        "Now the works of the flesh are plain: immorality, impurity,
                     licentiousness" (Gal. 5:19, RSV).
                        "Make no mistake: no fornicator or idolator, none who are
                     guilty either of adultery or of homosexual perversion . . . will
                     possess the kingdom of God" (1 Cor. 6:9, 10, NEB).
                        "In this degenerate age many will be found who are so
                     blinded to the sinfulness of sin that they choose a licentious life
                     because it suits the natural and perverse inclination of the heart.
                     Instead of facing the mirror, the law of God, and bringing their
                     hearts and characters up to God's standard, they allow Satan's

         Part 4   "Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for
   MARRIAGE WITH what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness?
     UNBELIEVERS and what communion hath light with darkness?" (2 Cor. 6:14).

                       This admonition not to be unequally yoked with unbelievers
                    applies to various aspects of life, including business and recrea-
                    tion. Marriage is one of the possible ways of unequal yoking
                    together.
                       In Paul's day marriage with an unbeliever usually meant mar-
                    riage to a pagan. The ways and views of a pagan were so utterly
                    different from the Christian faith that to marry one was like
                    trying to join light with darkness.
                       Among the Old Testament people of God marriage with a
                    Canaanite was forbidden. (See Ezra 9:2, 12; Mal. 2:11.) In one of
                    the sad experiences that came to Israel, consorting of the men
                    with heathen women led to the worship of false gods and the
                    death of 24,000 Israelites. (See Num. 25:1-5, 9).
                       Writing to a sister who was considering marriage with one not
                    united with her in religious faith, Ellen White said: "My sister,
                    unless you would have a home where the shadows are never
                    lifted, do not unite yourself with one who is an enemy of
                    God."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 363.
                       In that same letter Ellen White asked: "Will it [this new rela-
                    tionship] be a help to you in the Christian life? Will it be pleasing
                    to God? .. .
                        "What has been his past record? Is his life pure? Is the love
                    which he expresses of a noble, elevated character, or is it a mere
                    emotional fondness? ... Can she [the wife] honor the Saviour's
                    claims as supreme?"—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 362.
                       The Seventh-day Adventist Church puts its influence squarely
                    against the marriage of its members with unbelievers and the
                    Manual for Ministers states:
                        "Ministers should not perform the marriage ceremony of be-
                    lievers with unbelievers, because this is expressly contrary to

                    any on earth. It was designed to be a blessing to mankind. And it
                    is a blessing wherever the marriage covenant is entered into

            Part 5    What is the only legitimate exception for divorce and remar-
          DIVORCE, riage?
       REMARRIAGE
                      "And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife,
                   except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, commit-
                   teth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth
                   commit adultery" (Matt. 19:9).

                        Many are the reasons marriage partners give for wanting to be
                     divorced, such as cruelty, desertion, lack of support, or incom-
                     patibility. Jesus commented pointedly on divorce and the be-
                     liever must not ignore His judgment.
                        Divorce of a spouse by a church member because the spouse
                     was not a believer was opposed by the apostles. (See 1 Peter
                     3:1, 2; 1 Cor. 7:12-14.) The effect of New Testament teaching is
                     not to make divorce and remarriage easy, but rather the oppo-
                     site.
                        The Seventh-day Adventist Church has studied the question
                     of divorce and remarriage diligently and has formulated an
                     eleven-point statement based on the Bible and the spirit of
                     prophecy writings. It is found in the Church Manual, in chapter
                     15, and is the controlling policy to be followed in every Adventist
                     church in dealing with cases that arise among its members. We
                     quote here a meaningful paragraph which precedes the state-
                     ment of the eleven-point position:
                        "Those who speak for the Advent Movement are not commis-
                     sioned of God to frame resolutions that fit the desires of the
                     human heart, but only those that fit the heavenly standards. The
                     question of divorce and remarriage is one that has troubled the
                     church through all the centuries, and no easy solutions are
                     possible for the fearful problems that men and women often
                     create for themselves and the church by their departure from
                     God's ideal. But spiritual problems that grow out of violated
                     standards are never solved by lowering those standards."—

 THINK IT THROUGH      Is it better to seek divorce from a guilty marriage partner or
                     to try to forgive and heal the injured union?

                       "Among the Jews a man was permitted to put away his wife
                     for the most trivial offenses, and the woman was then at liberty
                     to marry again. This practice led to great wretchedness and sin.
                     In the Sermon on the Mount Jesus declared plainly that there
                     could be no dissolution of the marriage tie except for unfaith-

Honor Between the Sexes            LESSON 8                             ❑ Friday
                                                                      February 18
          Part 6   "Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took
   LOVE IN HONOR Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and
                 Isaac was comforted after his mother's death" (Gen. 24:67).

                      The Bible contains a number of love stories such as Isaac and
                   Rebekah, Jacob and Rachel (Gen. 29:29, 30), Boaz and Ruth
                   (Ruth 4:11-13). In all of these there is a picture of love with
                   honor.
                      In the area of sex relationship there is a path of dishonor. It is
                   sinful for a person to beguile one of the other sex into a relation-
                   ship condemned by God and the church's standards. It is no
                   excuse to claim that the relationship is based on love. For love
                   to be valid it must harmonize with principle, and a principle of
                   right can never be thrust aside in an effort to justify some tawdry
                   emotion even in the high name of love.

                     How did Jesus demonstrate a redemptive and corrective
                   attitude to those who had sinned and been guilty of dishonor-
                   able conduct? John 8:3-11.

                      There is also the path of honor between the sexes. Sex is
                   among the things God created in the beginning, and He pro-
                   nounced all of His creation good. (See Gen. 1:31.) If, as God
                   said, it is good, then it is also sacred and not to be abused in any
                   sense.
                      The love that joins men and women in marriage under God is
                   honorable and responsible. It is made up not only of an emo-
                   tional response between man and woman, but also has an
                   intellectual quality based on the approval of will and con-
                   science. Marriage is honorable in all (Heb. 13:4). The Bible
                   condemns those who forbid to marry (1 Tim. 4:1-3), though the
                   way is open to those who wish to do so to refrain from marriage
                   to serve God more fully (1 Cor. 7:32).
                      "In both the Old and the New Testament, the marriage rela-
                   tion is employed to represent the tender and sacred union that
                   exists between Christ and His people. To the mind of Jesus the
                   gladness of the wedding festivities pointed forward to the re-
                   joicing of that day when He shall bring home His bride to the
                   Father's house, and the redeemed with the Redeemer shall sit
                   down to the marriage supper of the Lamb."—The Desire of

         CHRISTIANS
                        In the writings of the apostle Paul the words in KJV translated
                     "conversation" in Philippians 3:20; and "commonwealth" in
                     Ephesians 2:12, and "fellowcitizens" in Ephesians 2:19 are all
                     related linguistically to one Greek root that has to do with
                     citizenship. Paul is saying simply that the Christian is a citizen of
                     a heavenly kingdom, the one that Jesus announced at the be-
                     ginning of His ministry when He said "Repent: for the kingdom
                     of heaven is at hand" (Matt. 4:17).

                        In the symbolic description of Jesus in Revelation 19:11-16,
                       what position of Jesus is emphasized?

                         When we speak of a kingdom, we imply the existence of a
                       ruler, of laws, and of subjects. All these are present in the
                       kingdom of heaven established by Jesus. Christ is the King

                       from the power of darkness and are translated "into the king-

                       heirs of the kingdom (James 2:5) which is an everlasting king-

                         "God placed man under law, as an indispensable condition of
                      his very existence. He was a subject of the divine government,

                        In earthly society a person's birth makes him a subject of the
                    realm. In Christ's kingdom entrance is also by birth, a rebirth
                    (John 3:5). One is not forced to accept this heavenly citizenship;
                     it comes through faith in Christ, by the action of the will, by
                     repentance and confession, all motivated by love—Christ's love
                     for the sinner, and the sinner's loving response to that tender,
                     winning appeal.
                        Once in the kingdom of Christ, the subject adopts the ways of
                     the kingdom, its principles and its requirements. He is always
                     alert to these and wants to fulfill his obligation to live as a
                     subject of that kingdom. He must be faithful to it and never deny
                     its claims upon him. To do so is to deny Christ, his Lord (Matt.

     THE STATE is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of
 ORDAINED OF GOD God. Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the
               ordinance of God" (Rom. 13:1, 2).

                         "The powers that be are ordained of God." Considering the
                     evil nature of some secular powers that have existed through
                     the course of history, this seems to be a most difficult statement
                     to accept. The lesson in it for Christians is that they recognize
                     the authority of rulers as God-given, and that their own concern
                     is to be good citizens. "The Christian ... will not presume to take
                     it into his own hands to resist or to depose 'the powers that
                     be.' "—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 626.
                        Paul was writing to the Roman Christians at a most turbulent
                     time in the Jewish history. Incidents of rebellion against the
                     Roman power were frequent among the Jews. Christians were
                     not to be involved in such rebellions, evil and despotic though
                     the controlling government might be.
                        Christians were to live in cooperation with their appointed
                     rulers, showing an example of loyalty and order in things relat-
                     ing to this life. Notice the ways in which Christians could sup-
                     port their rulers:
                        1. They would be obedient to magistrates (Titus 3:1).
                        2. They would pray for authorities (1 Tim. 2:1, 2).
                        3. They would submit to laws (1 Peter 2:13, 14).
                        4. They would honor the king (1 Peter 2:17).
                        5. They would pay their taxes (Rom. 13:7).
                        All in all, the Christian folldwing these admonitions would be
                     an ideal citizen. We can hardly think of one joining in undermin-
                     ing the authority of government officers.

                        "We should not work in a manner that will mark us out as

                                                                    February 23
          Part 4   "For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad.
       THE STATE Would you have no fear of him who is in authority? Then do
        REQUIRES what is good, and you will receive his approval, for he is God's
       OBEDIENCE servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he
                 does not bear the sword in vain; he is the servant of God to
                 execute his wrath on the wrongdoer. Therefore one must be
                 subject, not only to avoid God's wrath but also for the sake of
                 conscience" (Rom. 13:3-5, RSV).

                      One's view of government is necessarily affected by his view
                    of history and the development of governmental patterns.
                      The Christian expresses the proposition that God is, and
                    throughout history has been, in ultimate control of affairs in this
                    world. There are those who, on the other hand, view world
                    history as having come through its various stages as the pro-
                    duct of man's struggles, his growth in wisdom, and his response
                    to his environment. In their thinking there is no God who has a
                    guiding role in the affairs of men. They do not feel any need to
                    give any thought to an obligation to God as they strive by their
                    own efforts to make changes or to improve their condition.
                      The Christian never embarks on any course of action without
                    sensing his duty to act within the knowledge and plans of God.
                    This leads him to examine all the issues that concern him and
                    the state to see how they relate to his relationship to God. He
                    must look also at how his own position may affect or influence
                    his fellowmen.

                      What is Peter's counsel on the Christian's relation to gov-
                    erning authorities? 1 Peter 2:13, 14.

                      Christians therefore accept the existence of rules as in God's
                    plan and offer their cooperative obedience as good citizens.


 THINK IT THROUGH     How can we express opposition to an ordinance of the state
                    that is contrary to our duty to God without undermining re-
                    spect for all law? When a law is unjust, is it right for Christians
                    to go about trying to change it?

                      "Some, I saw, have a prejudice against our rulers and laws;
                    but if it were not for law, this world would be in an awful
                    condition. God restrains our rulers; for the hearts of all are in His
                    hands. Bounds are set, beyond which they cannot go. Many of
                    the rulers are those whom Satan controls; but I saw that God
                    has His agents, even among the rulers. And some of them will
                    yet be converted to the truth. They are now acting the part that
                    God would have them."—Testimonies, vol. 1, p. 203.

The Christian and the State            LESSON 9                         ❑ Thursday
                                                                        February 24

             Part 5    "Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the
        DUALITY OF things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are
         CHRISTIAN God's" (Matt. 22:21).
       OBLIGATIONS
                       Everyone in this world lives within some sort of political order,
                    whether it be under a constitution, tribal law, a monarchy, or
                    military rule. Nations and communities have government, and
                    no individual can long insulate himself from that actuality.
                    While some governments have a Christian philosophy, even to
                    the point where the Christian faith is established in the govern-
                    ment, some are based on other religious traditions, or are
                    frankly atheistic.
                       The Christian lives within his own political order; and, though
                    this is a world of sin and often of injustice, he looks upon the
                    political order as within the mind of God, even as a present part
                    of His plan for this world. In his relationship with the state there
                    is no absolute personal liberty; for the state, in order to continue
                    as the state, claims a degree of power over its subjects.
                       This situation in one's country does not cancel the fact that
                    the Christian is also a citizen of Christ's kingdom. The Christian
                    citizen therefore carries dual citizenship. It is certainly not ethi-
                    cal for him to deny the claims of either one; rather, he must
                    recognize the existence of both and endeavor to discharge the
                    obligations of both under God.
                       In some issues both the state and the heavenly kingdom claim
                    legitimate authority over the Christian, for example, the laws
                    that regulate our relationships to our fellow citizens as stealing,
                    lying, and doing bodily harm to another. The laws of God go
                    farther in regulating not only an ouward act but even the
                    thoughts and motives. (See Matt. 5:21, 22, 27, 28; 2 Cor. 10:5.)
                       Thus the Christian strives to maintain a correctness of life that
                    makes for good citizenship on earth and loyalty to the heavenly
                    Father.

 THINK IT THROUGH       What are some situations where obedience to government
                      raises problems for a Christian? How can these be resolved?

                         "In His Gift to the world the Lord has revealed how solicitous
                      He is that we bear in our lives the marks of our heavenly citizen-
                      ship by letting every ray of light we have received shine forth in
                      good works to our fellow-men."—Sons and Daughters of God,

                                                                      February 25
          Part 6   "Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you
  LOYALTY TO GOD more than unto God, judge ye" (Acts 4:19).
     PARAMOUNT     "Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We
                 ought to obey God rather than men" (Acts 5:29).

                       We have noted that in some governments there is an official
                    recognition of Christianity and even its establishment as the
                    religion of the state. In other governments a religion other than
                    Christianity may be the established religion. In still other gov-
                    ernmentsthere is constitutional separation of church and state.
                       In some situations the church as an organization seeks to use
                    political authority or to wield social power so as to achieve its
                    own ends.
                       Whatever the circumstances, the individual Christian sus-
                    tains a basic relation to God and Christ in which no earthly
                    power can intervene to tell him what he must do. In the Biblical
                    view the state does not possess absolute sovereignty, but the
                    claims of the state are always limited by the claims of God. It has
                    never been the purpose of God, who made man a free moral
                    being, that he should live under an order based on coercion
                    alone; and God has reserved in the mind and will of man the
                    right to make God first in all things.
                       Obedience to God first may result in paying a high price under
                    an oppressive earthly rule, and many are the millions of Chris-
                    tians who have paid that price. True Christians have always
                    feared God above men.

                     What was the challenging question hurled by Pharaoh at
                    Moses and Aaron at their first encounter? Ex. 5:2.

                      Review briefly the prophecy of Revelation 13 and its lessons
                    and warnings regarding loyalty to God.

 THINK IT THROUGH     Politics has been described as the art of compromise. What
                    kind of compromise is acceptable, and which is not accepta-
                    ble?

                      "We are to receive this word [the Bible] as supreme authority.
                    We are to recognize human government as an ordinance of
                    divine appointment, and teach obedience to it as a sacred duty,
                    within its legitimate sphere. But when its claims conflict with the
                    claims of God, we must obey God rather than men. God's word
                    must be recognized as above all human legislation. A 'Thus
                    saith the Lord' is not to be set aside fora 'Thus saith the church'
                    or a 'Thus saith the state.' The crown of Christ is to be lifted
                    above the diadems of earthly potentates."—The Acts of the

                                                                      February 27

 THE CHRISTIAN AND law?
     HIS NEIGHBOR
                      "Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the
                    fulfilling of the law" (Rom. 13:10).

                        The term "neighbor" is a concept used frequently in the
                     Bible. In the KJV it occurs in some form at least 136 times in the
                     Old Testament and 21 times in the New Testament. The Old
                     Testament admonitions about relationship to one's neighbor
                     reached out to almost every situation in life. Offenses against a
                     neighbor called for stiff penalties (Exodus 22). Taking up a
                     reproach against a neighbor is condemned (Ps. 15:3) as is
                     privily slandering a neighbor (Ps. 101:5). Despising a neighbor
                     shows lack of wisdom (Prov. 11:12); and is a sin (Prov. 14:21).
                        Sometimes mere chance makes us neighbors in the narrow
                     sense of living nearby, in a community where our paths cross
                     from time to time, our children play together, and even house-
                     wives come over occasionally to borrow a cup of flour or sugar.
                     God has cast our lot with people so as to make them our
                     neighbors, to give them a helping hand in a crisis, to lift their
                     morale, to share with them the truth of which we are custodians.
                     Could we bestow a better favor upon a neighbor than to share
                     our faith with him? Certainly God will expect us to give an
                     account of our stewardship with respect to our influence upon
                     and our treatment of our neighbors. In the uneven journey of life
                     we need them and they need us. A Roman sage said that when
                     your neighbor's house is afire your own house is endangered;
                     and the reverse is true too.
                        Jesus, our Example and our Lord, revealed the true meaning
                     of "neighbor" in the parable of the Jewish priest, the Levite, and
                     the Samaritan traveler. The neighbor principle fails in the pres-
                     ence of personal pride or churchly indifference; it reaches
                     across lines of racial prejudice and stuffy tradition when love
                     and compassion fill the heart.

 THINK IT THROUGH       Give some thought to the ninth and tenth commandments
                     (Ex. 20:16, 17) and show how they would apply in your twen-

                        "By no selfish practices can the cause of Christ be served. His
                     cause is the cause of the oppressed and the poor. In the hearts
                     of His professed followers there is need of the tender sympathy
                     of Christ—a deeper love for those whom He has so valued as to
                     give His own life for their salvation. These souls are precious,
                     infinitely more precious than any other offering we can bring to

                                                                     February 28
       . Part 2   "And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell
        HUMAN on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times
    BROTHERHOOD before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation" (Acts
                17:26).

                       People are frequently driven by greed, lust, and feelings of
                    superiority. As a result some sorry chapters have been written
                    into history in man's dealings with his fellowmen. In some areas
                    exploitation has been carried out in the form of colonialism,
                    particularly by the white races over darker peoples. A particu-
                    larly grievous relationship through the centuries has been that
                    of master and slave. Although the days of slavery are past, there
                    remains a sort of economic slavery where one class abuses
                    another for profits.
                       In the Old Testament times God recognized the evil of these
                    unfair or unfortunate social arrangements and sought to al-
                    leviate and to set bounds on them. Such was the purpose of the
                    year of jubilee (Lev. 25:10, 13).
                       In New Testament times the leaven of Christian teaching
                    spread through the pagan nations and struck hard at slavery,
                    polygamy, the gladiatorial contests, and similar practices.
                    Today principles of Christian love must be applied anew to
                    intercommunity, international, and interracial relations.

                      Where have all of the races on earth come from? Gen. 3:20;
                    10:32.

                      The "one blood" principle strikes a death blow at the claims
                    of any group that seeks to elevate itself above another for its
                    own selfish pride or gain.

 THINK IT THROUGH     How does Christ's death on the cross supply us with a
                    measure of God's regard for every portion of the human race?
                    Are any left outside the boundary of God's concern?

                       "During His earthly ministry Christ began to break down the
                    partition wall between Jew and Gentile, and to preach salvation
                    to all mankind. Though He was a Jew, He mingled freely with the
                    Samaritans, setting at nought the Pharisaic customs of the Jews
                    with regard to this despised people. He slept under their roofs,
                    ate at their tables, and taught in their streets."—The Acts of the

                                                                              March 1

         CHRISTIANS
          AND RACE       "Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I per-
                       ceive that God is no respecter of persons: but in every nation
                       he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted
                       with him" (Acts 10:34, 35).

                          The teachings of the Bible lead to these conclusions about
                       race:
                          1. All men are a part of God's creation.
                          2. The burden of sin rests equally upon all, so that there is no
                       elite race free from sin.
                          3. God sent Jesus to die for everyone. He died for the poor
                       degraded cannibal of the jungle as well as for the enlightened
                       and sophisticated people of every continent.
                          4. The saving, restorative, and healing work of the gospel can
                       be received equally by any people.
                          5. The gospel commission places every Christian under obli-
                       gation to teach the gospel in all parts of the world.
                          6. The entrance of gospel truth brings humility into relations
                       among all the races, and as fellow Christians they are ready to
                       bend down and wash one another's feet as fellowsaints of the
                       same heavenly household.
                          7. There are no second-class saints in God's family judged on
                       minority status, economic disadvantage, or lack of education.
                          8. Christ showed the way in dealing with race problems by
                       extending the blessings of His redemptive grace to Samaritans.
                       Phoenicians, Romans, Greeks, and Jews.
                          9. Racial intolerance is a judgment based on external criteria
                       and is unsound and unchristian.

 THINK IT THROUGH        Recall the people of various races and nationalities that live
                       in your community and point out some of their qualities that
                       contribute to the total culture.

                         "In the gift of His Son for our redemption, God has shown how
                       high a value He places upon every human soul, and He gives to
                       no man liberty to speak contemptuously of another. We shall
                       see faults and weaknesses in those about us, but God claims
                       every soul as His property—His by creation, and doubly His as
                       purchased by the precious blood of Christ. All were created in
                       His image, and even the most degraded are to be treated with
                       respect and tenderness. God will hold us accountable for even a
                       word spoken in contempt of one soul for whom Christ laid down
                       His life."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, pp. 56, 57.

The People Around Us          LESSON 10                          ❑ Wednesday
                                                                     March 2
           Part 4   "Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that
         ROOTS OF thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of
        PREJUDICE Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans"
                  (John 4:9).

                      Embedded in the customs of many peoples are indications
                    that they look down upon those of another race. It also comes
                    out in the language as in prejudicial terms that cast a slur upon
                    the members of another race or citizens of another country.
                      The use of such expressions marks the user as uncouth,
                    inconsiderate, or prejudiced. The Christian rejects these words
                    and roots them out of his working vocabulary.
                      There may be prejudice that is based on fear, such as fear of
                    competition, and this should give way to a recognition that
                    every man is entitled to an opportunity to achieve his best.

                       An eye-opening experience is to be a visitor or a resident in
                    a foreign land. What did God say to the children of Israel about
                    the treatment of foreigners who might live among them? Deut.
                    10:19.

                      We need to know all people better, to win their confidence,
                    and draw them to Jesus.

 THINK IT THROUGH     Examine your own life or culture to single out habits or ways
                    that might be objectionable to people of another race or coun-
                    try.

                       "When the Holy Spirit is poured out, there will be a triumph of
                    humanity over prejudice in seeking the salvation of the souls of
                    human beings. God will control minds. Human hearts will love
                    as Christ loved. And the color line will be regarded by many very
                    differently from the way in which it is now regarded. To love as
                    Christ loves, lifts the mind into a pure, heavenly, unselfish
                    atmosphere."—Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 209.
                       "No distinction on account of nationality, race, or caste, is
                    recognized by God. He is the Maker of all mankind. All men are
                    of one family by creation, and all are one through redemption.
                    Christ came to demolish every wall of partition, to throw open
                    every compartment of the temple, that every soul may have free
                    access to God. His love is so broad, so deep, so full, that it
                    penetrates everywhere. It lifts out of Satan's circle the poor
                    souls who have been deluded by his deceptions. It places them
                    within reach of the throne of God, the throne encircled by the
                    rainbow of promise."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 386.

The People Around Us            LESSON 10                             ❑ Thursday
                                                                         March 3
            Part 5   "And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowl-
         WHEN GOD edge after the image of him that created him: where there is
        RE-CREATES neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Bar-
                   barian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all"
                   (Col. 3:10, 11).

                        There is the utmost hopefulness in the gospel of Christ
                     toward man in whatever plight or circumstance he may be
                     found.
                        When Paul was writing to Titus about conditions among the
                     people in the island of Crete, he had some very unpleasant
                     things to say about the inhabitants. He pointed out: "One of
                     themselves, a prophet of their own, said, 'Cretans are always
                     liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.' This testimony is true" (Titus
                     1:12, 13, RSV). Yet Paul expressed great hope for those people.
                        Ellen White wrote of Jesus:
                        "He sees on every hand souls in darkness, bowed down with
                     sin and sorrow and pain. But He sees also their possibilities. He
                     sees the height to which they may attain. Although human
                     beings have abused their mercies, wasted their talents, and lost
                     the dignity of godlike manhood, the Creator is to be glorified in
                     their redemption."—Gospel Workers, p. 38.

                       What outlook or attitude toward the race question would be
                     absolutely necessary in the life of a successful missionary?
                     1 Cor. 9:22.

                        "Never does the gospel put on an aspect of greater loveliness
                     than when it is brought to the most needy and destitute regions.
                        . Those who have been loathed and abandoned are through
                     faith and pardon raised to the dignity of sons and daughters of
                     God. Lifted above the world, they sit in heavenly places in
                     Christ. They may have no earthly treasure, but they have found
                     the pearl of great price."—Testimonies, vol. 7, p. 226.

 THINK IT THROUGH      Have you ever invited persons of another race or culture to
                     share the hospitality of your home?

                       "We have no right to keep our minds stayed on ourselves, our
                     preferences, and our fancies.... We have a character to main-
                     tain, but it is the character of Christ. Having the character of
                     Christ, we can carry on the work of God together. The Christ in
                     us will meet the Christ in our brethren, and the Holy Spirit will
                     give that union of heart and action which testifies to the world
                     that we are children of God."—Testimonies, vol. 9, pp. 187, 188.

        INCLUSIVE tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed
                  with white robes, and palms in their hands" (Rev. 7:9).

                      Long forgotten will be the suspicions of this sinful life on
                    earth. Language barriers will not stand between; distances that
                    now separate will be bridged; misconceptions that now feed
                    human prejudices will be cleared away.
                      No one will be jealous that those of a different race or color
                    are there; these envies or resentments have long since, even
                    while on earth, been cleansed away in the breadth of vision that
                    comes with Christ's salvation and the redeemed heart.
                      No one is degraded or humiliated; all have but one ambition,
                    to serve one another in the spirit of their Lord. Heaven is the
                    ultimate equalizer, both in concept and in condition.
                       We are traveling together toward that heavenly home. We
                    have been called from the ways and thought patterns of the
                    world, to look on God's great humanity as He does. He is making
                    up the jewels of His kingdom, and they display a rich variety of
                    people. In every one Christ sees the travail of His soul and is
                    satisfied.

                      What did Jesus teach about where the saved will come
                    from? Matt. 8:11; John 10:16.

                    mation may be wrought as has ever been wrought in genera-

                    will seek to restore the image of God in man. There are those
                    who have had very meager opportunities, who have walked in

          Part 1  What traits of His character did God reveal to Moses on
 GOD'S CHARACTER Mount Sinai?

                       "And the Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed, The
                     Lord, The Lord God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and
                     abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for
                     thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and
                     that will by no means clear the guilty" (Ex. 34:6, 7).

                        God has supreme power in the universe, in our world, and in
                     the affairs that have to do with our salvation. He alone is worthy
                     to exercise this great power, for it rests in a Being whose very
                     nature is wisdom and love. It was in order to demonstrate that
                     love and mercy that the Son of God came to save the inhabitants
                     of our guilty, rebellious world. How different it would have been
                     with us had God chosen to deal with us according to what we
                     justly deserve.
                        The condition of our world, filled as it is with deceit, immoral-
                     ity, hatred, bloodshed, and injustice, cries out for retribution.
                     Why does God delay in setting things right? The answer is
                     clearly seen in the character of God as revealed in the Bible in
                     dealing with individuals and nations in instances such as: (1)
                     the sin of Israel (Ex. 32:9-11, 14; Num. 14:17-20); (2) the sin of
                     David (2 Sam. 12:13,14); (3) the sparing of Nineveh (Jonah 3:10).
                        We have another example of divine forbearance and patience
                     in the way Jesus dealt with Peter, who denied Him during His
                     trial (Luke 22:60-62).
                        The character of God should be seen increasingly in the lives
                     of Christians.

 THINK IT THROUGH      What lessons to guide us in our relationship with those over
                     whom we have some measure of control can we find in God's
                     dealings with our world and His people? What evidences exist
                     that God's sovereign power is under the control of His mercy
                     and justice?

                         "When we study the divine character in the light of the cross
                     •we see mercy, tenderness, and forgiveness blended with equity
                      and justice. We see in the midst of the throne One bearing in
                      hands and feet and side the marks of the suffering endured to
                      reconcile man to God. We see a Father, infinite, dwelling in light
                      unapproachable, yet receiving us to Himself through the merits
                      of His Son. The cloud of vengeance that threatened only misery
                      and despair, in the light reflected from the cross reveals the
                      writing of God: Live, sinner, live! ye penitent, believing souls,
                      live! I have paid a ransom."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 333.

The Moral Use of Power            LESSON 11                               ❑ Monday
                                                                            March 7
           Part 2   "Jesus called them to him and said, 'You know that in the
     THE SPIRIT OF world, rulers lord it over their subjects, and their great men
    DOMINATION IN make them feel the weight of authority; but it shall not be so
       THE WORLD with you" (Matt. 20:25, 26, NEB).

                       We must all agree that there should be a proper exercise of
                    authority by those who control in society, in the home, and even
                    in the church. This is a part of God's order and should have our
                    consent and cooperation.
                       However, in the world we often witness the exercise of naked
                    power, resulting in oppression, discrimination, extortion, per-
                    secution, and similar injustice. This is in tune with the spirit of
                    the world but not with the kingdom of Christ. It is in harmony
                    with the character of the prince of this world who has always
                    lusted for power.

                      What are some of the characteristics ascribed to Lucifer by
                    the prophet Isaiah? Isa. 14:12-14.

                      "When Adam sinned, man broke away frOm the heaven-
                    ordained center. A demon became the central power in the
                    world. Where God's throne should have been, Satan placed his
                    throne. The world laid its homage, as a willing sacrifice, at the
                    feet of the enemy."—Counsels to Teachers, p. 33.
                      The philosophy of worldly power is to have no place among
                    the subjects of Christ's kingdom.
                      "For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of
                    the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the
                    world" (1 John 2:16).
                      Notice how the spirit of domination is exercised in the last
                    days to control the lives of people through oppression and
                    discrimination. (See Rev. 13:16, 17.)

 THINK IT THROUGH     In what organizations is a spirit of dominance evident?

                      "Lucifer desired God's power, but not His character. He
                    sought for himself the highest place, and every being who is
                    actuated by his spirit will do the same. Thus alienation, discord,
                    and strife will be inevitable. Domination becomes the prize of
                    the strongest. The kingdom of Satan is a kingdom of force;
                    every individual regards every other as an obstacle in the way of
                    his own advancement, or a steppingstone on which he himself
                    may climb to a higher place."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 435, 436.

                                                                          March 8

            Part 3  "But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that
       PAYING BACK curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them
          FOR EVIL which despitefully use you, and persecute you" (Matt. 5:44).

                       The words of Christ in the Sermon on the Mount sound so
                     unreal and other-worldly. Some would even say they are not
                     very workable in this thoughtless, competitive, unjust world.
                       We are not to "resist evil" (Matt. 5:39), or to fight back when
                     smitten (verse 39); but to yield to unjust lawsuits (verse 40), and
                     to love our enemies (verse 44). Thus we will be children of our
                     Father which is in heaven (verse 45).
                        What penetrating, difficult instruction this is for us in our
                     human frame of thinking! It is difficult for us humanly to imagine
                     how it is possible for the meek to inherit the earth (verse 5). How
                     can they ever hold out?

                       What principle is especially enjoined upon the brethren in
                     their relations one with another? 1 Peter 3:8, 9.

                        It is only as we have the mind of God, as we begin to become
                     sharers of His nature, that we come to understand how such a
                     renewal of human attitudes can take place, and how valid are
                     the principles Jesus proclaimed.
                        Our minds need to be cleansed from the prides and worldly
                     standards of this life, and spiritually sensitized repeatedly by the
                     flooding of the Spirit into our hearts.
                        The Christian can only agree with Paul's statement about
                     God's evaluation that "the wisdom of this world is foolishness"
                     (1 Cor. 3:19).
                        How can we refrain from paying back evil with evil? By recog-
                     nizing that our case is in God's hands, as Joseph did with his
                     brothers who had wronged him so terribly in his youth.

 THINK IT THROUGH      Does making others suffer really heal our own wounds?
                     How far should we go in claiming our dues in the face of open
                     dishonesty on the part of others?

                        "Strength of character consists of two things—power of will
                     and power of self-control. Many youth mistake strong, uncon-
                     trolled passion for strength of character; but the truth is that he
                     who is mastered by his passions is a weak man. The real great-
                     ness and nobility of the man is measured by the power of the
                     feelings that he subdues, not by the power of the feelings that
                     subdue him. The strongest man is he, who, while sensitive to
                     abuse, will yet restrain passion and forgive his enemies. Such
                     men are true heroes."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 656.

The Moral Use of Power         LESSON 11                         ❑ Wednesday
                                                                     March 9
         Part 4   "Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he
    CHRIST'S USE shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?"
      OF POWER (Matt. 26:53).

                     The attitude of Christ toward the use of power is in striking
                  contrast to the attitudes of the world and even of those of His
                  followers nearest to Him. To Pilate He declared: "My kingdom is
                  not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would
                  my servants fight" (John 18:36). When Peter d rew the sword and
                  cut off the ear of the high priest's servant, Jesus rebuked him
                  and accepted the indignity that lay ahead (verses 10, 11). James
                  and John wanted Jesus to call fire down from heaven upon a
                  village of the Samaritans who would not show hospitality to Him
                  and His party. He rebuked them and said, "Ye know not what
                  manner of spirit ye are of" (Luke 9:55). He declined to say who
                  should sit at His right and left in His kingdom, leaving that with
                  His Father to decide (Matt. 20:23).
                     On the other hand, Jesus drove out the merchants and money
                  changers from the temple, saying they had made it a den of
                  thieves (Matt. 21:12, 13). He was zealous to enhance God's
                  honor, not to exercise His own authority. Christ had power to
                  forgive sins and did not hesitate to exercise it (Matt. 9:6; John
                  8:11). He bestowed upon His twelve disciples power to cast out
                  unclean spirits and to heal diseases (Matt. 10:1). Jesus Himself
                  spoke with an authority that generated confidence in the minds
                  of His listeners (Luke 4:32, 36).
                     Christ used His power to instruct, heal, combat the forces of
                  evil, and overcome their results. He never used His power for
                  display, selfish reasons, or to prove Himself to His critics. Herein
                  we discern the holiness of His character: knowing He pos-
                  sessed the power, He used it with such discrimination. He saw
                  that genuine changes in men's thought and action come about
                  only by reason and persuasion.

                    What does Peter point out as one way in which Jesus uses
                  His great power? 2 Peter 1:3.

                    "Christ has given us His life as a pattern, and we dishonor Him
                  when we become jealous of every slight, and are ready to resent
                  every injury, supposed or real. It is not an evidence of a noble
                  mind to be prepared to defend self, to preserve our own dignity.
                  We would better suffer wrongfully a hundred times than wound
                  the soul by a spirit of retaliation, or by giving vent to wrath.
                  There is strength to be obtained of God. He can help. He can
                  give grace and heavenly wisdom."—Testimonies, vol. 2, pp. 426,

            Part 5  "Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine
        RESTRAINTS heart be glad when he stumbleth" (Prov. 24:17).

                        Saul, out of jealousy and moved by a perverse, evil spirit,
                     endeavored to take David's life. On two occasions during this
                     time Saul fell under David's power. At one time David cut off the
                     skirt of Saul's robe, but later repented that he had acted so
                     boldly and disrespectfully toward the king (1 Sam. 24:4-6). On
                     another occasion David and Abishai penetrated Saul's camp at
                     night and took away his spear and cruse of water. David refused
                     to take the life of the king when it was within his power to do so
                     (1 Sam. 26:8-12).
                        Abraham refused to exericse his seniority and authority over
                     his nephew, Lot. He gave Lot his choice of territory to avoid
                     clashes between their herdsmen (Gen. 13:7-9).
                        "The cultivation of a uniform courtesy, a willingness to do to
                     others as we would wish them to do to us, would annihilate half
                     the ills of life. The spirit of selfaggrandizement is the spirit of
                     Satan; but the heart in which the love of Christ is cherished, will
                     possess that charity which seeketh not her own."—Patriarchs
                     and Prophets, p. 133.
                        When asked about the tares growing among the wheat, the
                     householder instructed the servants to let the tares remain until
                     the harvest time (Matt. 13:27-30).
                        Unhappily, now as well as in Bible times, many show lack of
                     restraint in the use of power. For an extreme example, see the
                     story of how Herod had John the Baptist beheaded (Mark 6:
                     25-28).

 THINK IT THROUGH      How does the exercise of restraint apply at home? at
                     school? at work? in traveling on the highway?

                        "Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in
                     honour preferring one another" (Rom. 12:10).
                        "Every true Christian will develop in his life the characteris-
                     tics of this divine love; he will reveal a spirit of forbearance, of
                     beneficence, and a freedom from envy and jealousy. This
                     character developed in word and act will not repulse, and will
                     not be unapproachable, cold, and indifferent to the interests of
                     others. The person who cultivates the precious plant of love will
                     be self-denying in spirit, and will not yield self-control even
                     under provocation. He will not impute wrong motives and evil
                     intentions to others, but will feel deeply over sin when discov-

The Moral Use of Power           LESSON 11                              ❑ Friday
                                                                        March 11
         Part 6   "Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any
 CHRISTIAN INFLU- man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you,
  ENCE AT WORK so also do ye" (Col. 3:13).

                      The Old Testament sets forth principles of ethical conduct.
                    Lending money at an exorbitant rate of interest was especially
                    pointed out as unjust (Ex. 22:25). Even a poor person's raiment,
                    taken as a pledge, was to be returned before the coldness of the
                    night set in (verses 26, 27). Amos called for justice and righ-
                    teousness to be exercised in the nation (Amos 5:24).

                      What is the instruction in the New Testament about the
                    behavior of believers toward others?

                      Guard against the source of wars and fightings among you
                    (James 4:1); put off anger, wrath, malice (Col. 3:8); lay aside
                    malice, guile, envies (1 Peter 2:1); show the fruit of the Spirit
                    (Gal. 5:22-24).

 THINK IT THROUGH     In what ways should I improve in exercising care and re-
                    straint toward others and in seeing that my attitudes and
                    actions are just?

                       "God has given to men talents of influence which belong to
                    Him alone, and no greater dishonor can be done to God than for
                    one finite agent to bring other men's talents under his absolute
                    control, even though the benefits of the same be used to the
                    advantage of the cause. In such arrangements one man's mind
                    is ruled by another man's mind, and the human agency is sepa-
                    rated from God and exposed to temptation. Satan's methods
                    tend to one end—to make men the slaves of men. And when this
                    is done, confusion and distrust, jealousies and evil surmisings,
                    are the result. Such a course destroys faith in God and in the
                    principles which are to control, to purge from guile and every
                    species of selfishness and hypocrisy.
                       "The high-handed power that has been developed, as though
                    position has made men gods, makes me afraid, and ought to
                    cause fear. It is a curse wherever and by whomsoever it is
                    exercised. This lording it over God's heritage will create such a
                    disgust of man's jurisdiction that a state of insubordination will
                    result. The people are learning that men in high positions of
                    responsibility cannot be trusted to mold and fashion other
                    men's minds and characters. The result will be a loss of confi-
                    dence even in the management of faithful men."—Testimonies

                                                                          March 13

            Part 1   "And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in
         HYPOCRISY themselves that they were righteous, and despised others"
                   (Luke 18:9).

                      The parable that follows the above text is about the two men
                     who went up to the temple to pray.

                       What was the status and attitude of the first worshiper?
                     Verses 11, 12. Compare him with the other worshiper and his
                     attiude. Verse 13.

                        The Pharisee was in reality paying homage to himself, to his
                     lack of evil deeds in contrast to the lives of the sinners around
                     him. How greatly he gloried in his status, his correctness in
                     living by the letter of the law! There appeared to be much to
                     approve in the way he lived. His fault lay in making himself the
                     center of his life and worship.
                        The humble publican was aware of his inner unfitness to
                     reach God's standard of holiness. His genuine humility drew the
                     approval of Jesus. There is also a false humility that could
                     almost be called a "proud humility." It is a kind of good works by
                     which a person may seek to please God. The perfect pattern in
                     humility is that shown by Jesus as described by Paul in Philip-
                     pians 2:5-8.

                       What is hypocrisy? And in what connection did Christ speak
                     of it? (See Matt. 6:2; 23:13-15, 25.)

 THINK IT THROUGH      Why should we not allow the fear of being called hypocrites
                     to deter us from trying to lead an upright, moral life?

                       "There is cheap religion in abundance, but there is no such
                     thing as cheap Christianity. Self may figure largely in a false
                     religion, but it cannot appear in Christian experience."—
                     Testimonies to Ministers, p. 339.
                        "Among the followers of our Lord today, as of old, how wide-
                     spread is this subtle, deceptive sin [of hypocrisy]! How often our
                     service to Christ, our communion with one another, is marred
                     by the secret desire to exalt self! How ready the thought of
                     self-gratulation, and the longing for human approval! It is the
                     love of self, the desire for an easier way than God has appointed
                     that leads to the substitution of human theories and traditions
                     for the divine precepts. To His own disciples the warning words
                     of Christ are spoken, 'Take heed and beware of the leaven of the
                     Pharisees.' "—The Desire of Ages, p. 409.

                                                                         March 14
          Part 2   "But now the righteousness of God without the law Is man-
  SOURCE OF TRUE ifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets; even
   RIGHTEOUSNESS the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto
                 all and upon all them that believe" (Rom. 3:21, 22).

                       Since "all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God"
                    (Rom. 3:23), it follows that righteousness cannot be found
                    within man. The principles of rightdoing are implanted in the
                    regenerated life by the Holy Spirit (Rom. 8:1, 4; 1 Cor. 3:16).
                       The life pattern of the believer does not come up fully to the
                    standard of God's righteousness. The righteousness of Christ is
                    imputed to him so that before God he is seen as altogether
                    righteous (Rom. 3:22).
                       "Through the work of the Holy Spirit, the sanctification of the
                    truth, the believer becomes fitted for the courts of heaven; for
                    Christ works within us, and His righteousness is upon us."—
                    Selected Messages, bk. 1, p. 395.
                       The Christian knows the source of his righteousness and
                    takes no credit for what he has achieved in keeping God's law.
                    He lives with assurance that God has pardoned his sins and
                    moment by moment gives him strength to prevail.

                      Would this not be a good moment to pause and repeat with
                    faith and full assurance the promise of Jesus in the fourth
                    Beatitude? Matt. 5:6.

 THINK IT THROUGH     Apply the following statements from the pen of Ellen White
                    thoughtfully to your own experience:

                      "We should take the greatest care to live a blameless life and
                    abstain from all aopearance of evil, and then it is our duty to
                    move boldly forward, and pay no regard to the reproachful
                    falsehoods of the wicked."—Testimonies, vol. 1, p. 353.
                       "The righteousness manifested in the character of Christ was
                    forever to be the anchor, the saving hope, of the world. Every
                    soul who chooses Christ can say with faith, 'The Lord my righ-
                    teousness.' "—Selected Messages, bk. 1, p. 348.
                       "Those whom heaven recognizes as holy ones are the last to
                    parade their own goodness. The apostle Peter became a faithful
                    minister of Christ, and he was greatly honored with divine light
                    and power; he had an active part in the upbuilding of Christ's
                    church; but Peter never forgot the fearful experience of his
                    humiliation; his sin was forgiven; yet well he knew that for the
                    weakness of character which had caused his fall only the grace
                    of Christ could avail. He found in himself nothing in which to

           Part 3   "Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be
      NO SALVATION justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin"
        BY WORKS (Rom. 3:20).

                       When we say that there is no salvation by our works, we do not
                     take the position that there is salvation without good works.
                     Good works in the life of one who has chosen to accept God's
                     way will follow his faith as surely as sun and rain bring the
                     harvest.
                       The danger lies in placing one's confidence for salvation in
                     the merits of one's own record of good deeds. Many religious
                     people, because they wanted to perform some worthy deed,
                     have built churches or shrines, and that is good; but the chari-
                     table act does not ensure their acceptance with God.

                       What was the basis of Paul's hope of acceptance in God's
                     sight? Phil. 3:9; Titus 3:5. (Compare with Gal. 2:16.)

                        Paul had much over which he might feel personal satisfac-
                     tion: his race and tribe, his religious sect, his zeal, his observ-
                     ance of the law, and his high moral character, all of which might
                     be looked upon as gain (Phil. 3:5, 6).
                        Luther, ascending the sacred stairs in Rome on his knees,
                     came suddenly to the realization that this ceremony was really
                     powerless to save him. He could not win God's approval by
                     performing meritorious works. The same is true of pilgrimages,
                     fastings, even prayers when done by rote to gain merit. The only
                     life that counts is the one based on faith, which is followed by
                     obedience.

                       What is the meaning of Ezekiel 14:14?

 THINK IT THROUGH      Have I been trusting to my good works, and if I have, how
                     should I change my relationship to God?

                       "None but God can subdue the pride of man's heart. We
                     cannot save curselves. We cannot regenerate ourselves. In the
                     heavenly courts there will be no song sung, To me that loved
                     myself, and washed myself, redeemed myself, unto me be glory
                     and honor, blessing and praise. But this is the keynote of the
                     song that is sung by many here in this world. They do not know
                     what it means to be meek and lowly in heart; and they do not
                     mean to know this, if they can avoid it. The whole gospel is
                     comprised in learning of Christ, His meekness and
                     lowliness."—Testimonies to Ministers, p. 456.

                                                                       March 16
          Part 4  "Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; there-
        LOVE OF fore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of
   RIGHTEOUSNESS gladness above thy fellows" (Heb. 1:9).

                      When Jesus comes into the life and the Holy Spirit is active, a
                    love is generated for the things that are good, true, and holy.
                    This is God's way to break the hold of sin in the human life. The
                    end of this experience is that one comes to love righteousness
                    as Jesus did. And this cultivating of the love of the right is one of
                    our most pressing needs.
                      The strong grip of the world upon our lives may be broken. An
                    acceptance of the lovely character of Christ alone can do this.
                    Then we will not love the sordid, prideful standards by which
                    this Satan-controlled world lives. Our ideals will reach up to the
                    lofty standards set before us in God's Word.
                       Our lives are molded by that upon which our faith is fixed. Do
                    we love Jesus and the traits of His character—honesty, truthful-

                    exalted and emulated in the acts of our daily lives.
                       "God has had moral heroes, and He has them now,—those
                    who are not ashamed of being His peculiar people. Their wills
                    and plans are all subordinate to the law of God."—Testimonies,

                    himself. Leaning upon men, and trusting in their wisdom, is

                    confidence is placed may be honest and true, serving the Lord

The Moral Man         LESSON 12                                             Thursday
                                                                            March 17
            Part 5     What is the meaning of salt in relation to the Christian life?
      SALT OF THE
           EARTH       "You are the salt of the earth; but if salt has lost its taste,
                     how shall its saltness be restored? It is no longer good for
                     anything except to be thrown out and trodden under foot by
                     men" (Matt. 5:13, RSV).

                        True Christianity in Christi followers gives a certain flavor to
                     life that is an influence in the world. Christians living in this
                     world remain in contact with society, and their genuine good-
                     ness and morality have a saving, restraining effect upon their
                     neighbors as they witness to God's holiness.
                        "It would be as unthinkable for a Christian to lose his essen-
                     tial characteristics and still be a Christian as it would be for salt
                     to lose its saltiness and still be considered and used as salt. If
                     Christians are such in name only, their nominal citizenship in
                     the kingdom of heaven becomes a farce. They are not Christians
                     unless they reflect the character of Christ, regardless of what
                     their profession may be."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p.
                     330.
                        The Jewish moralists, branded by Christ as hypocrites, had
                     lost their saltiness. Yet God had intended them to be the bearers
                     of His salvation to the world. He intended that they should be
                     moral and redemptive seasoning in the world.

 THINK IT THROUGH      A person from whose life the saltiness, the grace and the
                     power of God, is lost is "good for nothing." What am I good for
                     in this world?

                          'Ye are the salt of the earth,' Jesus said. Do not withdraw
                     yourselves from the world in order to escape persecution. You
                     are to abide among men, that the savor of the divine love may be
                     as.salt to preserve the world from corruption.
                        "Hearts that respond to the influence of the Holy Spirit are the
                     channels through which God's blessing flows. Were those who
                     serve God removed from the earth, and His Spirit withdrawn
                     from among men, this world would be left to desolation and
                     destruction, the fruit of Satan's dominion. Though the wicked
                     know it not, they owe even the blessings of this life to the
                     presence, in the world, of God's people whom they despise and
                     oppress. But if Christians are such in name only, they are like
                     the salt that has lost its savor. They have not influence for good
                     in the world. Through their misrepresentation of God they are
                     worse than unbelievers."—The Desire of Ages, p. 306.

The Moral Man         LESSON 12                                             ❑ Friday
                                                                            March 18
            Part 6     What is the purpose of letting one's light shine?
MAKING RIGHTEOUS-
  NESS BELIEVABLE      "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your
                     good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven" (Matt.
                     5:16).

                        It would be ideal if all Christians were attractive people so that
                     their character and life would draw unbelievers to Christ and
                     give them confidence in the Christian way. Unfortunately some
                     so-called Christians may show traits that have just the opposite
                     effect so that others tend to be repelled or disappointed rather
                     than drawn to the Christian faith.
                        Our mission in life is to represent the way of uprightness so
                     that those around us will have confidence in our morality and
                     then in Christ from whom it comes. Some of the qualities that
                     will help to build this confidence are these:
                        1. Humility. Do not make a parade of goodness. No one is
                     likelyto admire our way if we seem to show pride in our morality.
                     (See 1 Cor. 13:4; Matt. 6:1.)
                        2. Consistency. Our actions must conform reasonably to our
                     profession; otherwise we fall into the trap of hypocrisy. To
                     frankly admit our errors and confess our sins will add credibility
                     to our example. Keep in mind David's example. (See 2 Sam.
                     24:10.)
                         3. Tact. We should avoid thrusting our ideas upon those we
                     wish to win. They may not be ready to take the advanced stand
                     that we have chosen. People must be allowed opportunity to
                     weigh issues and reach their own decisions. The Holy Spirit
                     must be given time to do its quiet work upon the heart.

 THINK IT THROUGH      In what ways do I fail to be a believable Christian in my home
                     and community?

                        "When those who profess the faith show their lives to be
                     consistent with their faith, then we shall see a power attending
                     the presentation of the truth, a power that will convict the sinner
                     and draw souls nigh to Christ.
                        "A consistent faith is rare among rich men. Genuine faith,
                     sustained by works, is seldom found. But all who possess this
                     faith will be men who will not lack influence. They will copy after
                     Christ; they will possess that disinterested benevolence, that
                     interest in the work of saving souls, that He had."—Testimonies,

                                                                          March 20
          Part 1    "Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this
        THE DEDI- one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and
       CATED WILL reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press
                  toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in
                  Christ Jesus" (Phil. 3:13, 14).

                      God has given to us the capacity to choose between right and
                    wrong. He has revealed to us a knowledge of the issues that
                    pertain to right and wrong. There is thus placed upon us the
                    responsibility for the path we shall choose.
                      The matter of free choice is a clear teaching of God's Word.
                    (See Deut. 30:19; Rev. 22:17).

                      What commendation did Jesus give Mary for the role she
                    had assumed at the time of His visit in her home? Luke 10:42.

                      Our choice decides our destiny. No individual will be saved
                    against his will. God respects our choices, and when we choose
                    salvation He comes to help and support us. We must place our
                    will on His side in response to His invitation. As we dedicate our
                    will to making the right moral choices—obeying His law, follow-
                    ing His will—we also seek His sustaining and supporting grace.
                    God wants us to rise above the fickleness and instability of a life
                    of moral indecision.
                      Notice the comments of the apostle James:
                      "He that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind
                    and tossed" (James 1:6).
                      "A double minded man is unstable in all his ways" (verse 8).
                      "Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he
                    will flee from you. Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to
                    you" (James 4:7, 8).

 THINK IT THROUGH     I bow to God and give my will to Him. I see my need and seek
                    His help. He has promised to come to me with His help, and in
                    faith I claim that promise.

                      "What you need to understand is the true force of the will.
                    This is the governing power in the nature of man, the power of
                    decision, or of choice. Everything depends on the right action of
                    the will. The power of choice God has given to men; it is theirs to
                    exercise. You cannot change your heart. you cannot of yourself
                    give to God its affections; but you can choose to serve Him. You
                    can give Him your will; He will then work in you to will and to do
                    according to His good pleasure."—Steps to Christ, p. 47.

            Part 2     What did Paul counsel Timothy to hold along with faith?
   THE CONSCIENCE
                       "Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having
                     put away concerning faith have made shipwreck" (1 Tim.
                     1:19).

                        Let us notice a definition of the conscience: "The sense or
                     consciousness of the moral goodness or blameworthiness of
                     one's own conduct, intentions, or character together with a
                     feeling of obligation to do right or be good."—Webster's
                     Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary.
                        "Conscience is the voice of God, heard amid the conflict of
                     human passions; when it is resisted, the Spirit of God is
                     grieved."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 120.
                        George Washington said, "Labor to keep alive in your breast
                     that little spark of celestial fire called Conscience."
                        From a study of the Bible on the subject of conscience several
                     principles stand out:
                        1. There is a conscience that is enlightened and responsive
                     (Acts 24:16; Rom. 9:1; 2 Cor. 1:12; Heb. 13:18).      •
                        2. A conscience can be abused so as to become seared and
                     unresponsive (1 Tim. 1:19; 4:2).
                        3. An abused conscience can be renewed in faith to exercise
                     its rightful place in the life (Heb. 9:14).

 THINK IT THROUGH      A conscience is personal, designed to guide myself, not
                     another.

                        "God does not send messengers to flatter the sinner. He
                     delivers no message of peace to lull the unsanctified into fatal
                     security. He lays heavy burdens upon the conscience of the
                     wrongdoer, and pierces the soul with arrows of conviction."—
                     The Desire of Ages, p. 104.
                        "This daily review of our acts, to see whether conscience
                     approves or condemns, is necessary for all who wish to arrive at
                     the perfection of Christian character."—Testimonies, vol. 2, p.
                     512.
                        "Let it be written upon the conscience as with a pen of iron
                     upon the rock, that real success, whether for this life or for the
                     life to come, can be secured only by faithful adherence to the

             Part 3  "That he would grant you, according to the riches of his
          THE HOLY glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner
      SPIRIT'S PART man" (Eph. 3:16).

                       The Holy Spirit, sent from heaven as the Comforter, is also a
                    reprover of sin (John 16:7, 8). He works in behalf of righteous-
                    ness and judgment to help fit the soul to stand before God. He
                    guides the responsive person into truth (verse 13) and makes
                    the presence of Christ real in the inner life (verse 14).
                       Every true Christian has felt the influence of the Holy Spirit in
                    his life, drawing him, warning him, and reassuring him of the
                    things of Christ. As we invite Christ to take control of our lives,
                    the Holy Spirit makes the personal experience real. "The impar-
                    tation of the Spirit is the impartation of the life of Christ."—The
                    Desire of Ages, p. 805.
                       Furthermore the Holy Spirit causes the Christian graces,
                    called the "fruit" of the Spirit, to develop in the life. This fruit is
                    seen in the positive Christian virtues.
                       The Holy Spirit stands ready to help us. "Christ always sepa-
                    rates the contrite soul from sin. He came to destroy the works of
                    the devil, and He has made provision that the Holy Spirit shall be
                    imparted to every repentant soul, to keep him from sin ni ng."—
                    The Desire of Ages, p. 311.
                       The Holy Spirit was likened by Jesus to the wind whose pres-
                    ence is not seen but whose activity is real, being evidenced by
                    the results it produces. Though invisible to human eyes the Holy
                    Spirit's activities in the life are truly seen and felt, witnessing to
                    the divine presence.
                       "When the Spirit of God takes possession of the heart, it
                    transforms the life. Sinful thoughts are put away, evil deeds are
                    renounced; love, humility, and peace take the place of anger,
                    envy, and strife. Joy takes the place of sadness, and the counte-
                    nance reflects the light of heaven."—The Desire of Ages, p. 173.

THINK IT THROUGH      The Holy Spirit comes in as an invited guest; have I made
                    ready for Him, and am I really prepared to welcome Him?

                      "All who long to bear the likeness of the character of God
                    shall be satisfied. The Holy Spirit never leaves unassisted the
                    soul who is looking unto Jesus. He takes of the things of Christ
                    and shows them unto him. If the eye is kept fixed on Christ, the
                    work of the Spirit ceases not until the soul is conformed to His
                    image."—The Desire of Ages, p. 302.

Strength for Moral Action          LESSON 13                     ❑ Wednesday
                                                                    March 23
          Part 4   "The word of God is living and active, sharper than any
       POWER OF two-edged sword, piercing to the division of the soul and
      GOD'S WORD spirit, of joints and marrow, and discerning the thoughts and
                 intentions of the heart" (Heb. 4:12, RSV).

                       Paul was fully convinced of the power and authority of God's
                    Holy Word, and he believed in its effectiveness to do its work in
                    the Christian life.
                       God's Word defines truth, supports our faith, exposes un-
                    truth, and measures our conduct. Without it we are in hopeless
                    confusion as to the rightness and wrongness of our plans. The
                    philosophy of our time helps but little and is more likely to lead
                    us astray. The Bible is the Christian's source book for ethical
                    judgments. Jesus used the Old Testament Scriptures to give the
                    authority for His rejection of Satan's subtle temptations (Matt.
                    4:4, 7, 10), and as the foundation for His doctrine.
                       Ellen White teaches the importance of Scripture. "One sen-
                    tence of Scripture is of more value than ten thousand of man's
                    ideas or arguments."—Testimonies, vol. 7, p. 71.
                       The Bible, studied sincerely, will educate and correct the
                    conscience. "If we would live a true Christian life, the con-
                    science must be quickened by constant contact with the word
                    of God."—Testimonies, vol. 7, p. 195.
                       The Bible lifts us from earth into a heavenly atmosphere. "As
                    you take the Bible in your hands, remember that you are on holy
                    ground."—Fundamentals of Christian Education, p. 195.
                       The Bible is God's message to us. "It [the Scriptures] is the
                     medium of communication between God and man."—The
                    Great Controversy, p. 69.

 THINK IT THROUGH     How can I increase my growth daily, weekly, in knowledge of
                    the Bible?

                      "When the Bible is made the study book, with earnest suppli-
                    cation for the Spirit's guidance, and with a full surrender of the
                    heart to be sanctified through the truth, all that Christ has
                    promised will be accomplished. The result of such Bible study
                    will be well-balanced minds. The understanding will be quick-
                    ened, the sensibilities aroused. The conscience will become
                    sensitive; the sympathies and sentiments will be purified; a
                    better moral atmosphere will be created; and new power to
                    resist temptation will be imparted."—Counsels to Teachers, p.
                    357.

Strength for Moral Action           LESSON 13                          ❑ Thursday
                                                                         March 24
           Part 5     "I have set the Lord always before me: because he is at my
 DEPENDENCE UPON right hand, I shall not be moved" (Ps. 16:8).
     DIVINE HELP
                      When divine forces are invited to join us in the spiritual battles
                  of life, we have a majority on our side. This gives us confidence
                  and places the weight of the battle upon One who is able to bear
                  it. We wrestle against powerful forces, dark and evil (Eph. 6:12),
                  and so are admonished to put on the whole armor of God.
                      In the world's great religions we find many noble sentiments
                  and lofty ethical principles. These are effectual only as they
                  become operative in the lives of people.
                      In Christianity, centered in the life of God's Son, we have the
                  promise of divine help to live by the ethical principles taught.
                  This is the distinction between the way to God through Christ,
                  the door, as compared to the false ways that promise en-
                  lightenment but lack the power to make needed changes.
                     Here again the Bible points the way: (1) "Christ liveth in me"
                  (Gal. 2:20); (2) "It is God which worketh in you" (Phil. 2:13); (3)
                  "He is able to succor them that are tempted" (Heb. 2:18); (4)
                  "Grace to help in time of need" (Heb. 4:16).

 THINK IT THROUGH      It would be well for all of us to memorize the consecration
                     prayer from "Christ's Object Lessons," page 159"

                        "Lord, take my heart; for I cannot give it. It is thy property.
                     Keep it pure, for I cannot keep it for Thee. Save me in spite of
                     myself, my weak, un-Christlike self. Mold me, fashion me, raise
                     me into a pure and holy atmosphere, where the rich current of
                     Thy love can flow through my soul."
                        The results of this consecration are summarized in the follow-
                     ing paragraph:
                        "All who consecrate soul, body, and spirit to God will be
                     constantly receiving a new endowment of physical and mental
                     power. The inexhaustible supplies of heaven are at their com-
                     mand. Christ gives them the breath of His own spirit, the life of
                     His own life. The Holy Spirit puts forth its highest energies to
                     work in heart and mind. The grace of God enlarges and multi-
                     plies their faculties, and every perfection of the divine nature
                     comes to their assistance in the work of saving souls. Through
                     co-operation with Christ they are complete in Him, and in their
                     human weakness they are enabled to do the deeds of
                     Omnipotence."—The Desire of Ages, p. 827.

Strength for Moral Action         LESSON 13                            ❑ Friday
                                                                       March 25
           Part 6    "In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer;
      VICTORIOUS I have overcome the world" (John 16:33).
       IN CHRIST
                     We must never for a moment lose sight of the fact that
                  adequate heavenly agencies are with us to make our lives
                  spiritually successful and victorious. The victory in life is found
                  in Christ and when we take Him we have the victory. It cannot
                  elude our grasp as long as we hold firm to Him. (1) He is the Vine,
                  we are the branches (John 15: 1, 5); (2) He is the Shepherd: we
                  are His sheep (John 10:4, 11); (3) He is the Bread of life (John
                  6:35); (4) He is the "Prince of life" (Acts 3:15).
                     The ethical and moral standards for the Christian have been
                  set forth in God's law and His Word. We can reach them only
                  through faith in Christ. He is our final and only hope. Thank God
                  that He has overcome the world!
                     To be clothed in the robe of Christ's righteousness is not
                  simply an intellectual assent to orthodox doctrine. It is an ex-
                  perience that brings repentance, a new heart, and personal
                  trust and abiding in the all-sufficient Christ in whom is all the
                  fullness of the Godhead (Col. 2:9).
                     We look forward to the final moments of our existence on this
                  world, scarred in life's battles but victorious in Christ. Heaven
                  will be open to those who have not compromised their faith,
                  have not lowered their banners in the dust, but have pressed on
                  to reach the goal. "Here is the patience [endurance, RSV] of the
                  saints" (Rev. 14:12).
                     Ellen White gives this heartening assurance:
                     "All who ever enter heaven's gates will enter as conquerors.
                  When the redeemed throng surround the throne of God, with
                  palm branches in their hands and crowns on their heads, it will
                  be known what victories have been won. It will be seen how
                  Satan's power has been exercised over minds, how he has
                  linked with himself souls who flattered themselves that they
                   were doing God's will. It will then be seen that his power and
                   subtlety could not have been successfully resisted had not
                   divine power been combined with human effort. Man must also
                   be victor over himself; his temper, inclinations, and spirit must
                   be brought into subjection to the will of God. But the righteous-
                   ness and strength of Christ avail for all who will claim His
                   merits."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 384.
